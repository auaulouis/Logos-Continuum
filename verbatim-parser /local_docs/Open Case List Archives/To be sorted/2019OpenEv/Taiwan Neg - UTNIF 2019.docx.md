### No F-16 Sales

#### No F-16 sales -- Trump is tabling for tariffs

**Walcott and Worland** 4-18-**19** ("Taiwan Won\'t Get U.S. Fighter
Jets While Trump Seeks a China Deal,"
https://time.com/5564773/taiwan-fighter-jet-sale-trump-china/) bhb

The **[Trump]{.underline}** Administration **[has put on hold a
previously reported sale of jet fighters to Taiwan until the United
States seals a trade deal with China]{.underline}**, three
Administration officials told TIME on Thursday.

**[That decision has contributed to concern]{.underline}** among some in
the Administration that **[the President may soon go soft on China in
his desire to secure a trade deal.]{.underline}** The draft trade
agreement currently under negotiation would boost Trump's political
fortunes and ease the jittery stock market, but it is unlikely to
address many of the issues at the core of the U.S.-China trade dispute,
said the U.S. officials, who spoke anonymously because they aren't
authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

**[The move underscores the complexity and difficulty of balancing U.S.
relations with an increasingly powerful China against the American
commitment to help Taiwan defend itself.]{.underline}** The White
House's initial decision, first reported late last month, to offer tacit
approval for Taiwan to buy 60 Lockheed Martin F-16V fighter jets was
widely seen as a U.S. show of strength against China.

The sale would be the first time the U.S. has sold F-16s to Taiwan since
1992. While the U.S. has a statutory obligation to aid Taiwan's defense
in its decades-long standoff with China, recent administrations have
stopped short of allowing the island to buy new fighter jets. The
**[Trump]{.underline}** Administration**['s]{.underline}** apparent
**[pause on the arms sale therefore represents a new deference to
China.]{.underline}**

#### Reducing arms sales will embolden Chinese aggression and trigger war

Study, the Rockefeller Foundation (Bellagio Study Center), the Woodrow

**[Taiwan remains the single issue which could spark war between the
United States and the People\'s Republic of China, a war that might
quickly go nuclear but would be devastating even were it to remain
conventional.]{.underline}** Apart from being a potential trigger for
war, Taiwan impedes improvement in U.S.--China relations because of
suspicion and mistrust. Beijing firmly believes that Washington seeks to
keep the PRC weak and divided to obstruct China\'s rise. Meanwhile,
Americans are adamant that resolution of the cross-Strait impasse happen
peacefully and with the assent of the people of Taiwan, although the
United States is uncommitted to any specific resolution.

China, therefore, is the most critical variable in determining future
U.S. policy toward Taiwan. There will occasionally be times when U.S.
officials are angered by Taiwan\'s policies or distracted by crises at
home and abroad. But if anyone in the U.S. government thinks about
severing ties with Taiwan, or significantly reducing them, it is because
of China. Diplomats, statesmen, and politicians in and out of
government---as well as businessmen, scholars, and the military---agree
that good relations with the PRC will be vital in the new Pacific
century. The big questions are whether sacrificing Taiwan would improve
those relations, whether conditions are ripe for such a determination,
and in what ways a change would affect other U.S. interests, including
American friends and allies in the region. Careful examination of these
variables leads us to conclude that **[the United States should neither
abandon nor reduce its commitments to Taiwan]{.underline}**, but
strengthen them.

Taiwan remains the single issue which could spark war between the U.S.
and China.

What Would Sacrificing Taiwan Gain?

Would abandoning or reducing support for Taiwan secure smoother
U.S.--China relations? Those in China and the United States who call for
a change in Taiwan policy insist there would be significant benefits.
The decision by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger to trade Taiwan for
normalization with Beijing facilitated a momentous improvement in
U.S.--China relations, setting a powerful precedent.\[ 2\] To choose
China over Taiwan once again, it is asserted, could help Washington
resolve differences with China over maritime rights, nuclear
proliferation, cyber security, and the uses of space. This line of
thinking argues that even issues not directly connected with Taiwan
policy could be easier to reconcile if what China deems a core interest
were satisfied.

Beyond breaking the U.S.--Taiwan bond, Beijing has denied any desire to
push the United States out of Asia. It has reaffirmed Deng Xiaoping\'s
injunction to \"hide its light and bide its time, while getting
something accomplished\" (taoguang yanghui, yousuo zuowei).\[ 3\] It has
repeatedly put development and peace first. However, China\'s superior
economic performance during the recession, surging global trade and
investments, and developing military might led Beijing during 2010 to
implement a series of assertive initiatives which caused widespread
anxiety in its neighborhood and internationally. As China\'s power
grows, its allegiance to Deng\'s maxim becomes more dated and stale.

**[A decision to jettison Taiwan, or even cut back significantly on U.S.
support, would prove to an increasingly confident China that Washington
has become weak, vacillating, and unreliable.]{.underline}** The 2009
U.S.--China Joint Statement reflected Beijing\'s estimate that
Washington could be intimidated or misled, as it juxtaposed a reference
to Taiwan as a Chinese core interest with concurrence that \"the two
sides agreed that respecting each other\'s core interests is extremely
important to ensure steady progress in U.S--China relations.\"\[ 4\]
**[Analysts who argue that Washington can safely appease
Beijing]{.underline}** because \"territorial concessions are not always
bound to fail\" **[are]{.underline}**, without evidence, **[assuming
improbably modest Chinese objectives]{.underline}** (emphasis added).\[
5\]

Relying on the sacrifice of Taiwan to fulfill Chinese ambitions ignores
more than intentions, it also overlooks internal dynamics in China.
Beijing confronts constant domestic turmoil. Corruption, income
inequality, and environmental degradation have tarnished the
accomplishments of the government and party. Fears among the leadership
concerning mounting social unrest, spurred by the Jasmine Revolutions in
the Middle East, produced harsh restrictions of the media and the
Internet along with the imprisonment of artists, underground church
members, protesting peasants, lawyers, and human rights activists.
Regaining Taiwan is unlikely to provide a broad and enduring balance to
internal unhappiness.

**[Beijing]{.underline}** also **[confronts militant nationalism
which]{.underline}**, though fostered by the government,
**[is]{.underline}** still **[difficult to control.]{.underline}** Any
suspicion that authorities are not adequately safeguarding Chinese
interests and securing international respect could threaten regime
stability. Accordingly, **[a U.S. sacrifice of Taiwan]{.underline}**,
while gratifying, **[could not thoroughly slake a continuing need for
Beijing to demonstrate its power. Indeed, the sacrifice might promote
new appetites and necessitate fresh efforts to satisfy that
need]{.underline}**.

### 2NC -- Turns Case

#### China-Taiwan relations are durable -- undermining US commitment to Taiwan will destabilize the region

**Kastner** 20**16** -- Scott L. Kastner is a Professor in the
Department of Government and Politics, University of Maryland, College
Park ("How Stable Is the Taiwan Strait?,"
https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/how-stable-taiwan-strait) bhb

After long being viewed as a flash point for conflict, **[relations
across the Taiwan Strait have stabilized tremendously since
Ma]{.underline}** Ying-jeou, who explicitly rejected Taiwanese
independence, was elected president of Taiwan in 2008. This
unprecedented period of China-Taiwan détente has been characterized by
frequent dialogue between officials from the two sides, numerous
cooperative agreements, and the establishment of direct travel and
commercial linkages across the strait. The DPP\'s landslide victory in
Taiwan\'s January 2016 presidential election, however, was a stinging
rebuke to Ma\'s Nationalist Party (the Kuomintang or KMT). The DPP
historically has been committed to Taiwan independence, and Taiwan\'s
new president-elect, Tsai Ing-wen, rejects some of the key foundations
of Ma\'s cross-strait policy, including the idea that China and Taiwan
are part of the same country. Although Tsai has signaled that she will
approach crossstrait relations cautiously, it is unlikely that Beijing
will be satisfied with her approach. Thus, it is unlikely that the
recent détente will last.

The possibility that China-Taiwan relations could revert to their
pre-2008 state is disquieting, given that many analysts at the time
viewed armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait as a serious risk.
Nevertheless, **[although China-Taiwan relations will almost certainly
deteriorate to some degree under a Tsai presidency, military conflict
remains unlikely]{.underline}**. To understand why, it is important to
first consider some of the major trends that have characterized the
cross-strait relationship in recent years.

A Changing China-Taiwan Relationship

First, **[economic integration across the strait has become deeper and
more institutionalized]{.underline}**. China-Taiwan trade and investment
flows have grown rapidly since the 1980s; by the mid-2000s, the PRC had
replaced the United States as Taiwan\'s primary trading partner.
China-Taiwan trade continued to grow after 2008 as the two sides took
steps, such as lifting restrictions on direct trade across the strait,
to normalize bilateral economic ties.

Second, the military balance of power in the Taiwan Strait has been
shifting rapidly in China\'s favor. Preparation for a conflict in the
strait has been the primary driver of PRC military modernization efforts
dating to the 1990s, and China\'s booming economy has facilitated
impressive advances in this regard. The PRC most likely does not (yet)
possess the capacity to invade and occupy Taiwan, particularly if the
United States were to intervene in a cross-strait conflict. China
certainly has an increasing ability, however, to impose tremendous costs
on Taiwan in the event of a cross-strait war.

Third, Taiwanese public opinion on sovereignty issues continues to
evolve. To an increasing extent, most Taiwan citizens see themselves as
Taiwanese rather than Chinese, and they view political unification with
the PRC as a nonstarter. Indeed, most Taiwanese today reject unification
even under hypothetically favorable conditions, such as the emergence of
democracy in China. The recent détente in cross-strait relations has not
altered these trends; to the contrary, the percentage of Taiwan\'s
citizens self-identifying as Taiwanese grew especially rapidly during
the Ma presidency. Still, **[most Taiwanese remain pragmatic. A majority
of Taiwanese, for instance, does not support formal independence if it
were to trigger armed conflict with China.]{.underline}**

Decreased but Persistent Risk of Conflict

When considered together, **[the trends outlined above are helping to
stabilize China-Taiwan relations]{.underline}**. Even though China\'s
improving relative military capabilities suggest that coercion is
becoming more feasible for Beijing, this effect is tempered by the
strong stake in stability generated by extensive cross-strait economic
integration---and, indeed, China\'s broader integration into global
markets. **[For Taiwan, the potential costs of a military confrontation
in the strait have become catastrophic, which in turn gives any
Taiwanese leader a strong incentive to pursue cautious cross-strait
policies and avoid actions that risk crossing PRC
redlines.]{.underline}**

To be sure, continued consolidation of a separate Taiwan identity,
combined with the DPP\'s landslide victory in Taiwan\'s recent
elections, will increase pessimism in Beijing about social and political
trends in Taiwan and will exacerbate fears that the island may be
slipping from China\'s grasp. Nevertheless, other factors encourage
continued PRC patience in the Taiwan Strait. The shifting military
balance is the most obvious example in this regard, as it gives PRC
leaders reason to believe that China\'s bargaining position will
continue to improve. China also has some reason to be cautiously
optimistic about trends in Taiwan\'s politics. Most notably, the
pragmatism of the Taiwanese public rewards politicians who adopt
moderate positions on cross-strait issues. Moreover, the PRC has learned
that the political environment changes quickly in Taiwan. Beijing became
deeply pessimistic when Chen Shui-bian of the DPP was reelected as
Taiwan\'s president in 2004, but by 2008 the KMT had swept national
elections in a landslide. Beijing, in short, has every reason to be
patient with a Tsai government.

**[Still, the underlying]{.underline}** sovereignty
**[dispute]{.underline}** between China and Taiwan
**[remains]{.underline}** fundamentally **[unresolved.]{.underline}**
Beijing will continue to view Taiwan as a core national interest, while
most Taiwanese will continue to see unification as a nonstarter. For
these reasons alone, the Taiwan Strait will remain a potential trouble
spot. Moreover, **[the shifting balance of military power could become a
source of renewed instability in the strait]{.underline}** if it comes
to dominate other factors---such as economic integration---that give
China a stake in a stable status quo. **[In such an environment, China
could become tempted to use its growing military strength to pursue a
more coercive approach to Taiwan.]{.underline}**

There are good reasons to think that Taiwan would resist such coercion,
even if it meant risking military conflict with the PRC. Most
importantly, public opinion trends clearly indicate no appetite in
Taiwan for political integration with the PRC. Simply put, most
Taiwanese today view their country as sovereign and independent even if
it lacks international legal recognition, and any leader contemplating
political accommodation with the PRC would likely face fierce domestic
opposition. During his 2011 re-election campaign, for instance,
President Ma encountered strong criticism after endorsing a cross-strait
peace agreement; Ma\'s decision to broach the subject was widely seen as
a major political blunder. Moreover, possible PRC reassurances to Taiwan
about the nature of any cross-strait political settlement lack
credibility---particularly in light of Beijing\'s obvious willingness to
intervene in Hong Kong politics despite the presence of a One Country,
Two Systems framework (a model that the PRC also proposes to apply to
Taiwan). Analysts, in short, should not assume that Taiwan will
peacefully accommodate a militarily more powerful PRC even if standing
firm risks armed conflict.

Thus, **[although major trends]{.underline}** in China-Taiwan relations
**[are stabilizing, the Taiwan Strait could again become a flash
point]{.underline}** if the shifting balance of military power comes to
overwhelm the influence of other factors that give Beijing a stake in
stability.

Maintaining the U.S. Commitment to Taiwan

The above analysis suggests that **[the United States will continue to
face difficult trade-offs in its Taiwan Strait policy]{.underline}**. On
the one hand, **[the United States should not]{.underline}**---as some
prominent analysts have suggested---**[scale back its commitment to
Taiwan. Such a change in U.S. policy would accelerate the shifting
balance of power in the strait, thereby magnifying the risk of armed
conflict between the PRC and Taiwan.]{.underline}** On the other hand,
**[Washington must continue to tread cautiously]{.underline}** on the
Taiwan issue. The fact remains that many in China care deeply about
Taiwan. PRC leaders will thus continue to feel compelled to react
strongly to U.S. policies and actions that appear to be ratcheting up
U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation---especially when Taiwan is governed by
the DPP.

### UQ -- Arms Sales Key

#### We control the direction of the turn -- arms sales are increasing now and deter Chinese agression

**Wong and Edmondson** 6-6-**19** -- Edward Wong is a diplomatic and
international correspondent for The New York Times; Catie Edmondson is a
reporter in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, covering
Congress. ("Trump Administration Plans to Sell More Than \$2 Billion of
Arms to Taiwan,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/us/politics/trump-taiwan-arms-sale.html)
bhb

The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[is proposing to sell more
than \$2 billion worth of]{.underline}** tanks and other **[military
equipment to Taiwan]{.underline}**, American officials said on Thursday.
The sale would add to tensions between the United States and China,
which are already clashing over trade, communications technology and a
military buildup in the Pacific region.

**[The sale would be one of the largest to Taiwan in recent years by the
United States]{.underline}**. The single costliest part of the package
is 108 M1A2 Abrams tanks, the officials said, and the deal would also
resupply some weapons, including portable anti-tank missile systems.

The United States does not give national recognition to Taiwan, a de
facto independent island off the southeast coast of China that the
Chinese Communist Party intends to bring back eventually under the
control of Beijing, by force if necessary. But the Taiwan Relations Act
obligates the United States government to help Taiwan maintain
self-defense capabilities, and each administration has sold it arms
packages. The United States is Taiwan's main arms supplier.

The Taiwan defense ministry requested the weapons in the latest package,
which was first reported by Reuters on Wednesday. Congress would have to
be notified of the deal before it could go forward.

**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[officials]{.underline}** have
become increasingly worried about the intentions of Chinese leaders
toward Taiwan, and they also **[regard Taiwan as an important
counterweight to China in the region.]{.underline}**

Though China's military capabilities still lag far behind those of the
United States, the People's Liberation Army has worked on weapons
systems, including anti-ship ballistic missiles, that might prove
effective against the United States Navy in the event of conflict in the
Taiwan Strait.

In recent months, the Pentagon has ordered naval ships to sail through
the Taiwan Strait with increasing frequency, in shows of strength that
officials call freedom of navigation exercises.

**[The proposed purchase of tanks and missiles is consistent with
Taiwan's deterrence strategy, said Bonnie]{.underline}** S.
**[Glaser]{.underline}**, a senior adviser for Asia at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.

**["They would help prevent an invasion, making it difficult for an
invading P.L.A. force to establish a beachhead in northern
Taiwan,"]{.underline}** she said, referring to the People's Liberation
Army. **["I expect]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}**
administration **[to approve this package, as part of a policy of
bolstering Taiwan's defenses."]{.underline}**

She added that **[the next package was likely to be for 66 F-16 fighter
jets, a sale]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** members of Congress
have been informed **[is currently under discussion]{.underline}**,
according to an American official.

### L -- China Will Isolate

#### China will manipulate concessions to isolate Taiwan

**Chase** 20**11** -- Michael S. Chase is a senior political scientist
at RAND, a professor at the Pardee RAND Graduate School, and an adjunct
professor in the China Studies and Strategic Studies Departments at
Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies
(SAIS) in Washington, D.C. (""Strong Indignation," but Limited
Retribution: China's Response to U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan," China Brief
Volume: 11 Issue: 19) bhb

Some Chinese analysts have suggested arms sales may stop eventually. For
example, Tao Wenzhao writes, "along with the development of U.S.-China
relations and cross-strait relations, more and more Americans will
realize that the strategic losses of arms sales to Taiwan outweigh the
gains, and the 'Taiwan Relations Act' undoubtedly will die of old age.
The United States should stop selling arms to Taiwan immediately,"
(Guangming Ribao, September 23). Others appear to recognize this is a
very unlikely outcome. Indeed, in addition to using Taiwan as a means of
checking China, Chinese observers cite other factors---such as economic
interests and U.S. and Taiwanese domestic political considerations---as
motives for continued arms sales (Study Times, October 3). Nonetheless,
Chinese commentators argue Washington harms its own interests by selling
arms to Taiwan, because China sees arms sales as infringing on its core
interests and could retaliate by limiting military exchanges and
cooperation on security issues. **[Warning that U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan are a "wrongful course toward doom" may be more rhetorical
flourish than anything else]{.underline}**, but, at a more substantive
level, such messages also suggest undermining Washington's willingness
to bear the consequences of future arms sales to Taiwan remains an
important Chinese objective (Xinhua, September 22).

**[At a more strategic level, Chinese analysts seemingly calculate that
driving a wedge between Washington and Taipei could isolate Taiwan and
give China greater bargaining leverage in future]{.underline}**
cross-Strait political and military **[negotiations]{.underline}**.
Indeed, some **[Chinese analysts have]{.underline}** expressed similar,
if more strident, views about the U.S. political connection to Taiwan as
the vital link that China must sever to promote unification on its
terms. For example, following the latest arms sales announcement, one
Chinese observer **[urged a stronger response to U.S. arms sales as a
means of pressuring Washington to change its policy, thus depriving
Taiwan of U.S. political backing and making people in Taiwan more
willing to accept unification with China]{.underline}** (Global Times
\[China\], September 29). **[Beijing, however, could easily overplay its
hand---especially if it fails to consider the possible unintended
consequences of such an approach. Indeed, trying to isolate Taiwan is
probably less likely to increase Taipei's willingness to negotiate on
China's terms than it is to leave it feeling too insecure to discuss
sensitive cross-Strait issues. Beijing may not believe it, but U.S.
support for Taiwan is a prerequisite for, not an obstacle to, the
further development of a more stable and constructive cross-Strait
relationship]{.underline}**.

## Taiwan Independence Turn

### 1NC

#### Reducing arms sales causes Taiwan to declare independence -- signal of abandonment

**Tucker and Glaser** 20**11** -- Nancy Bernkopf Tucker, Professor of
History at Georgetown University and at the Edmund A. Walsh School of
Foreign Service, she has been a fellow at the Institute for Advanced
Study, the Rockefeller Foundation (Bellagio Study Center), the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars, the United States Institute of

Forum ("Should the United States Abandon Taiwan?" *The Washington
Quarterly* Vol. 34, Issue 4) bhb

The Obama administration should stop equivocating and move forward with
arms sales. There will never be a good time to sell weapons to Taiwan.
Diplomacy with China as well as congressional routines and requirements
invariably intervene---what former deputy assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs Randall Schriver has called \"the
tyranny of the calendar.\" Upgrading existing aircraft would be welcome,
but Taiwan\'s aging and shrinking air force also needs new planes. Were
the United States to wait and the F-16 C/D production line to close,
Taiwan would have no other source. Washington might well be faced with
the complicated dilemma of whether to sell even more advanced F-35s.
Washington ought to reassert its longstanding position to Beijing that
**[sales]{.underline}** do not promote Taiwan\'s separation from the
mainland but, in the current phase of cross-Strait relations, **[create
an environment for improved China--Taiwan relations]{.underline}**.

Indeed, in the past two years, the United States has sold almost \$13
billion in weapons to Taiwan, and cross-Strait relations are in the best
shape in decades. **[In the absence of U.S. backing, Taipei would likely
be too insecure and Taiwan\'s leaders too vulnerable politically to
negotiate with China. Arms sales, therefore, facilitate cross-Strait
compromise and should not be anathema to Beijing.]{.underline}** The
United States should also accelerate dialogue with Taipei to promote
increased U.S.--Taiwan trade, reduce Taiwan\'s growing isolation from
regional and global trading blocks, and prevent yet more dependence on
China. Refusing to talk about a broad range of economic issues through
the only available dispute settlement mechanism, the Trade and
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), because of minor, if politically
thorny, problems like U.S. beef exports to Taiwan is a mistake. And
progress should be made on commonplace but important requests from
Taipei to join the U.S. visa waiver program and conclude a bilateral
extradition agreement.

Washington cannot sustain the U.S.--Taiwan relationship unilaterally.
Taipei has to assign priority to strengthening ties with Washington,
even as it improves relations with Beijing. This will require tackling
difficult domestic political obstacles in Taiwan and should be a
bipartisan endeavor. It will be increasingly important to conduct
relations in an environment of trust and candor.

There are risks to a strategy which strengthens rather than abandons
U.S. ties to Taiwan. If Washington continues to support Taiwan, it must
simultaneously find ways to convince Beijing that the United States does
not seek to prevent an accommodation between Taiwan and China. The
United States does not secretly promote independence or block progress
in cross-Strait relations. Rather, U.S. policy aims at sustaining
peaceful conditions in which Taiwan and China can reach a long-term
modus vivendi by themselves.

Although the Six Assurances and the Taiwan Relations Act attempted to
keep the focus of U.S.--Taiwan relations on the United States and
Taiwan, China has always been a critical variable and its importance is
growing. But **[those who worry that Taiwan policy will set back
U.S.--China relations ought instead to persuade China that, in the
absence of U.S. support, Taipei would likely lose confidence and put
negotiations with the mainland on hold. An abandoned and isolated Taiwan
might, in desperation, declare independence or even revive efforts to
produce nuclear weapons, not pursue unification as Beijing
assumes.]{.underline}** **[So, in fact, U.S. support is]{.underline}**
not harmful, but **[helpful to China\'s interests.]{.underline}**

The course of cross-Strait relations does not lead inexorably in any one
direction. **[Taiwan\'s options remain open. The United States wants
Taiwan stable, peaceful, and democratic for the people of Taiwan, as a
model to others in East Asia, and as assurance of U.S. credibility and
dependability. The United States should not abandon its principled
dedication]{.underline}** to freedom of choice, but should strengthen
it.

However, this does not mean that the Pentagon will shy away from
furthering military support to Taiwan. **[Since Trump has been in
power]{.underline}**, senior **[U.S. active-duty officers have

commonplace that Taiwanese combat personnel get trained on U.S.
bases]{.underline}** in continental America, **[including F-16
pilots]{.underline}** and now Marines. The exchange of intelligence,
both human and technological, has been strengthened. **[The U.S.-Taiwan
bilateral mechanisms of industrial cooperation in defense and weapons
procurement have been more active]{.underline}** and gained political
buttress. **[These are concrete steps to realize the relational
enhancement between two militaries from the early simple focus on
negotiating U.S. arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}** to strengthening
Taiwan\'s defense capabilities and its involvement in the U.S.-centered
regional security architecture.77

The way the talks of America abandoning Taiwan subsided reflects the
latter\'s strategic value in U.S. forward military deployment in Asia.78
**[Taiwan is geographically a key to the U.S. island chain
strategy.]{.underline}** It is like a nail struck in the middle of the
PLA\'s vital defense line along the east flank and effectively squeezes
China\'s coastal defense depth. **[This gives Taipei natural confidence
in U.S. protection.]{.underline}**79 The U.S. depiction of China as a
peer competitor serves as a geopolitical reason for improved U.S.-Taiwan
military ties, and the tilt of military balance across the Strait
underlines the continued U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. The cycle of Strait
militarization in the tripartite relationship has become consolidated
with the changing balance of power in favor of the mainland and as part
of a larger Sino-U.S. geostrategic strife.

Trump\'s earlier challenge to and later acceptance of the one-China
policy have demonstrated that the president\'s ignorance of foreign
affairs can be improved only through a belated learning process
depending on individual channels rather than institutional
decision-making processes. When considering all decisions by the U.S.

importance of Taiwan is reemphasized. Since the beginning of 2017, for
instance, Washington has **[increased]{.underline}** its **[security
cooperation with the island]{.underline}**, particularly in a
nontraditional sphere like antiterrorism. Besides, **[the arms sale of a

sales---to Taiwan]{.underline}** on 29 June 2017 **[is the first such
sale under the Trump administration]{.underline}**. This package
includes advanced missiles and torpedoes as well as technical support
for an early warning radar system, which has surely overshadowed the
Xi-Trump summit in April of that year and threatened to undermine
PRC-U.S. relations. **[In addition, the U.S. Congress has pushed for new
resolutions to upgrade Washington-Taipei relations, enhance the security
of Taiwan, and bolster Taiwan\'s participation in international
organizations]{.underline}** such as the WHA, Interpol, and the
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Some proposals may
lead to a port call of the U.S. Navy to Taiwan and sending uniformed
marines to the AIT in Taiwan. Another decision that would exert an
extremely serious impact on the cornerstone of U.S.-China relations is
the passage of the Taiwan Travel Act (TTA), which was passed without
amendment by unanimous consent in the U.S. Senate on 28 February 2018,
expressing \"the sense of Congress that the U.S. government should
encourage visits between U.S. and Taiwanese officials at all levels.\"65
President Trump\'s signature of the TTA indicates a breakthrough in
Washington\'s and Taipei\'s unofficial relationship at the price of
U.S.-China ties. This is followed by Washington\'s reluctance to allow
American airlines to redefine Taiwan as a non-state---under Beijing\'s
pressure---on their websites.66

# Advantage One -- Defense

### No War -- Domestic Concerns

#### No War -- arms sales are priced in -- Trump and Xi don't want political consequences of war

**Hu** 20**18** -- Weixing Hu is a Professor and Head of the Department
of Politics and Public Administration, University of Hong Kong
("Trump\'s China Policy and Its Implications for the \"Cold Peace\"
across the Taiwan Strait," *China Review*, Volume 18, Number 3) bhb

U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are an important issue that may affect future
cross-Strait relations during the Trump administration. Through the 1979
Taiwan Relations Act, Washington considers itself obliged to continue
providing arms to Taiwan to defend itself. For a long time, U.S. arms
sales have also been considered an important source of leverage for
Washington to interfere in cross-Strait relations. For decades after the
establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the United States
and PRC, Washington has maintained its influence in cross-Strait
relations by its arms sales to Taiwan. Beijing has tried very hard to
deprive Washington of this leverage but not successfully. Beijing\'s
strong reactions to the U.S. arms sales did not stop Washington\'s arms
sales. For Washington, Beijing\'s strong reaction indicates that with
growing economic and military strength, China has become less tolerant
of swallowing \"the bitter fruit\" of arms sales to Taiwan and has
attempted to change the rules of game on that issue. **[For Beijing,
Washington\'s consistent policy in arms sales to Taiwan also tells the
Chinese that it is still unrealistic to ask Washington to completely
stop selling arms to Taiwan, and it has to live with it for the
foreseeable future]{.underline}**.

Under Trump, U.S. arms sales are very likely to continue because the
administration\'s policy in probusiness and in favor of creating jobs
for American workers. Actually, after just a few months in office, the
Trump administration announced a new arms sales package to Taiwan. The
issue could lead to a new round of competition between Washington and
Beijing. Despite the lack of a clear Taiwan policy in the Trump
administration, conservative members of the U.S. Congress could take the
initiative to drive the relationship and become a source of conflict.
These members have already introduced new bills similar to the Taiwan
Security Enhancement Act introduced a few years ago in Congress to force
the administration to upgrade U.S.-Taiwan relations.36 Although the
prospects of these bills becoming law are weak, it could affect Trump\'s
conduct in his China policy and policy toward cross-Strait relations.

5\. Conclusion

**[The United States and China have different views on the current
\"cold peace\"]{.underline}** or hardening stalemate across the Taiwan
Strait. **[But they have overlapped interests in avoiding conflict and
maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.
Neither]{.underline}** President **[Trump nor]{.underline}** President
**[Xi wants the Taiwan issue to become the top priority in their
bilateral]{.underline}** \[End Page 84\] **[agenda.]{.underline}** The
Trump administration, unlike the Obama administration, does not have a
clear regional strategy of hedging and balancing against China in the
Asia Pacific. It has no interest in pushing Taipei and Beijing to the
negotiation table either.

It is unlikely that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will come up with
a new formulation that is equivalent to the 1992 Consensus or any other
form of reassurance toward each other. It is also unlikely the Tsai
Ing-wen government will rock the boat and move toward de jure Taiwan
independence. Therefore**[, if there are no new provocative actions from
the Tsai government, Beijing will withhold significant punitive actions
that may hurt the people in Taiwan. Beijing is preoccupied with its
domestic agenda.]{.underline}** As long as the Tsai government is not
pushing the envelope, Beijing will remain patient and let the status quo
continue. So **[cross-Strait and trilateral relations will remain in a
situation of muddling through and the \"cold peace\" will continue for
the foreseeable future]{.underline}**.

### No War -- Sales Not Threatening

#### New F-16s won't cause war -- doesn't threaten China's superiority

**Mollman** 3-31-20**19** -- Steve Mollman is the Asia Correspondent and
Weekend Editor at Quartz (""Extremely dangerous": China warns US on F-16
sales to Taiwan,"
https://qz.com/1584296/china-warns-us-on-f-16-sales-to-taiwan-calling-them-extremely-dangerous/)
bhb

**[The jets]{.underline}**, in reality, **[wouldn't do much to change
the power equation across the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}**, "nor will it
eliminate the threat that China poses to forcibly absorb a democratic
Taiwan," Scott Harold, an associate director of Rand Corp.'s Center for
Asia Pacific Policy, told Bloomberg (paywall).

The F-16Vs are advanced for what they are---fourth-generation fighter
jets---but **[China has fifth-generation stealth
fighters]{.underline}**, such as the J-20, **[that are deemed rivals
to]{.underline}** Lockheed Martin's **[advanced F-22s and F-35s. Sales
of F-35s to Taiwan, which have been ruled out, would be far more of a
provocation to China.]{.underline}**

Instead, the sale of the F-16s would be more of a political shock to
Beijing. The last time the US sold fighter jets to Taiwan---150 F-16s
under the administration of president George H. W. Bush---China
suspended military exchanges with the US. How it would respond this time
is uncertain, though **[it's hard to imagine China starting a conflict
over the sale of a few dozen not-so-cutting-edge jets.]{.underline}**

### No War -- DPP

#### China will not escalate over arms sales -- fear of emboldening the DPP

**Chase** 20**11** -- Michael S. Chase is a senior political scientist
at RAND, a professor at the Pardee RAND Graduate School, and an adjunct
professor in the China Studies and Strategic Studies Departments at
Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies
(SAIS) in Washington, D.C. (""Strong Indignation," but Limited
Retribution: China's Response to U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan," China Brief
Volume: 11 Issue: 19) bhb

China's reaction this time gives rise to a series of questions. First,
**[why does Beijing react with such rhetorical vehemence to the arms
sales? It seems it is not because of concerns that the arms sales will
fundamentally change the military situation]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[Chinese analysts suggest the latest arms sales will do little to
alter a cross-Strait military balance that clearly is shifting China's
way.]{.underline}** Further, according to Li Xiaoning of Beijing
University, **[the United States and Taiwan both know \"it is impossible
to rely on a few airplanes to change the balance of military strength
across the Strait]{.underline}**.\" Thus, the major concern Chinese
scholars have articulated is that the arms sales represent strong U.S.
political-military backing for Taiwan. As Li puts it, "the political
significance of Taiwan's military procurement from the United States is
much greater than the military significance, it is the hope of gaining
U.S. support," (Liberation Daily, September 23).

Some Chinese scholars also express concern that arms sales to Taiwan are
a reflection of U.S. strategic intentions toward China. For example, Sun
Zhe of Tsinghua University suggests continued U.S. arms sales are
intended at least in part to "play the 'arms sales card' to contain
China's rise," (Liberation Daily, September 23). Similarly, Tao Wenzhao
of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) suggests the arms sales
reveal the "two-sided nature" of U.S. policy toward China and reflect
Washington's determination to "use Taiwan to check China," (Guangming
Daily, September 23) Furthermore, according to Tao, the arms sales
indicate Washington is uneasy about the possible implications of the
rapid development of the cross-Strait relationship. In addition, Chinese
leaders feel the need to respond to domestic political pressure and
nationalist sentiment. They presumably want to avoid the appearance of
weakness on an issue as sensitive as U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.

Given that Chinese objections seem to focus more on the political
symbolism of U.S. backing for Taiwan than anything else, **[what
explains China's apparently moderate substantive response to the latest
arms sales? Chinese analysts suggested Beijing's relatively restrained
reaction was a function of several factors. These included the latest
arms sales package, Beijing's concerns about how a stronger reaction
might impact domestic politics in Taiwan]{.underline}** before its
January 2012 presidential and legislative elections and how it might
influence U.S.-China relations ahead of the upcoming leadership
succession in China. First, that the package did not include the
requested new F-16C/Ds probably made it easier for Beijing to take a
more restrained tack than if the new fighters had been part of the deal,
given the perceived symbolic importance of the potential sale of new
fighters. **[Another motive seems to be minimizing the risk of upsetting
cross-Strait relations in ways that could]{.underline}** undermine
President Ma Ying-jeou's chances of reelection or **[bolster the
opposition in Taiwan]{.underline}** ahead of the island's elections in
January (Liberation Daily, September 23). **[Domestic politics in China
and the need for a stable U.S.-China relationship also seem to have been
relevant.]{.underline}** Professor Shi Yinhong of Renmin University
attributed the muted response to the Chinese leadership's desire to
avoid creating problems ahead of Vice President Xi Jinping's expected
visit to the United States in early 2012, especially with a leadership
transition later next year in which Xi is expected to succeed Hu Jintao
as China's leader (Christian Science Monitor, September 27).

### No War -- Tariffs Instead

#### China will retaliate with tariffs, not conflict

**Kastner et al** 20**13** -- Scott L. Kastner is a Professor in the
Department of Government and Politics, University of Maryland, College
Park; William Reed is Professor in the Department of Government and
Politics and a research fellow in the Center for International

Proponents of this view, however, largely take it on face value that US
arms sales to Taiwan do in fact act as a significant constraint on US-
China cooperation.9 Yet, despite the strong emotional response arms
sales to Taiwan often generate in China, it is not obvious that these
sales have a major effect on the broader US-China relationship. On the
contrary, China has typically been reluctant to retaliate strongly in
response to US arms sales; rather, Beijing has tended to take more
symbolic, temporary, actions-such as freezing military exchanges and
postponing official visits.10 Given the importance China attaches to the
Taiwan issue, **[it strikes us as somewhat puzzling that the typical PRC
response to US arms sales hasn\'t been more forceful, especially since
Beijing has been willing to retaliate]{.underline}** against other
countries and in other issue areas when its interests are threatened. In
the past, for instance, China was willing to sanction both the
Netherlands and France for selling weapons to Taiwan, and both countries
ultimately reversed course on the issue.11 More recently, China reacted
strongly to the 2010 Japanese arrest of a Chinese fishing boat skipper
near the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, and has retali- ated against
Norway for the awarding of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese
dissident Liu Xiaobo (\...).12 And China has at times been willing to
retaliate against Washington **[when US actions threaten Chinese
interests in other issue areas]{.underline}**. After the US levied
tariffs on Chinese tires in 2009, for instance**[, China quickly
responded by imposing tariffs]{.underline}** on US automobile products
and chicken meat.13

### No Escalation -- China Would Lose

#### China will lose -- allied A2/AD capabilities

The new study by Michael Beckley, an Assistant Professor of Political
Science at Tufts University, was published in the academic journal
International Security. In the article, Beckley argues that China's
neighbors could thwart Chinese military aggression through
anti-access/area denial strategies with only minimal U.S. assistance.

"My main finding is that **[there is a budding balance of military power
in East Asia, which]{.underline}** the United States can reinforce at
moderate risk to U.S. forces," Beckley writes in the article.
"Furthermore, this balance of power **[will remain stable for years to
come, because China cannot afford the power-projection capabilities it
would need to overcome the A2/AD forces of its neighbors.]{.underline}**
The main reasons are that **[power projection forces are more expensive
than A2/AD forces by an order of magnitude.]{.underline}**"

A2/AD is most commonly discussed in relation to China's efforts to deny
America the ability to intervene in any regional conflict or make it so
costly that Washington is deterred from doing so. Some observers,
including James Holmes, Toshi Yoshihara and Andrew Krepinevich, have
argued that the United States and its Asian allies should this strategy
around on China. Instead of seeking to maintain command of the sea and
air as America has traditionally done, these scholars suggest Washington
and its allies could simply seek to deny China the ability to achieve
its goals. As Beckley puts it, "Under this strategy, the United States
would abandon efforts to command maritime East Asia and, instead, focus
on helping China's neighbors deny China sea and air control in the
region.

Beckley's main contribution is to test the viability of this strategy
for a number of foreseeable conflict scenarios. One of these, of course,
is a Chinese invasion of the Taiwan strait. While amphibious invasions
have always been the most difficult military maneuver to pull off, they
are especially difficult in an era of precision-guided munitions that
can pick off an invading force while they are still at sea.

To have any chance of successfully invading Taiwan, then, China would
have to establish total air superiority and command of the sea in the
area. As Beckley explains, "If Taiwan retained substantial air defenses
and offensive strike platforms, a Chinese amphibious invasion would be
impossible, because Taiwan could pick off PLA landing craft as they
motored across the Taiwan Strait and sea command in the strait."
Although China has amassed an incredibly large missile force to destroy
Taiwan's defensive capabilities at the outset of a conflict, it would
still need to take Taipei by total surprise to be successful. If Taiwan
had some advanced warning of an attack, it could disperse its aircraft
to some thirty-six military airfield across the islands, while also
relying on a number of civilian aistrips and even some highways that
double as emergency air bases. Taiwan also has a bunch of road-mobile
missile launchers and anti-aircraft weaponry, as well as a number of
ships and submarines capable of attacking Chinese forces with cruise
missiles.

As Beckley points out, there is little reason to believe that China
would be able to knock out all of these defenses in a surprise first
strike. To begin with, Taiwan has sophisticated early warning air
defense systems. Moreover, the United States has not even been able to
achieve this level of destruction against much lesser enemies like Iraq
during the First Gulf War or Serbia in 1999.

But if China was far more successful than the United States had been in
those conflicts, Beijing's ability to execute an amphibious invasion is
still far from certain. For instance, Beckley notes that only ten
percent of Taiwan's coastlines are suitable for an amphibious landing,
which would allow Taipei to concentrate its forces on a few key areas.
Chinese forces trying to land would likely be severely outnumbered.

Thus, even using the the most optimistic assessments (from Beijing's
perspective), China would have its hands full trying to conquer Taiwan.
Consequently, Beckley writes, "the United States would only need to tip
the scales of the battle to foil a Chinese invasion, a mission that
could be accomplished in numerous ways without exposing U.S. surface
ships or non-stealth aircraft to China's A2/AD forces." More
specifically, by the U.S. military's own estimates, America would need
"10,000 to 20,000 pounds of ordnance to decimate a PLA invasion force on
the beaches of Taiwan." This could be done, Beckley notes, using a
single B-2 bomber or an Ohio-class submarine.

Beckley goes on to demonstrate that China would have difficulty gaining
control over the East and South China Sea, given the nearly certain
resistance it would face from countries like Vietnam and Japan. Thus,
**[China's ability to militarily dominate the region is more unlikely
than is commonly appreciated.]{.underline}** That being said, **[China's
strategy to date seems to be to win without fighting]{.underline}**. So
far, this has been relatively successful.

# Advantage Two -- Defense

### Engagement Inevitable

#### US and China engagement is inevitable -- economics and international institutions

**Zhao and Dan** 20**19** -- Suisheng Zhao is a professor of Chinese
politics and foreign policy at the University of Denver\'s Josef Korbel
School of International Studies; Guo Dan Party School of the Central

Cold War? Causes and Future of the Emerging US---China Rivalry,"
*Vestnik RUDN. International Relations* Vol. 19 No. 1) bhb

Taking advantage of these underlying changes, China has bolstered its
power and profile. As the pressure to acquiesce to China is growing, an
in-creasing number of Asian countries have been pulled toward China's
orbit. As this geostrategic shift is gathering momentum, some have
leaned closer to China, soft-pedaling quarrels over the ter-ritorial
disputes and angling for a slice of Beijing's initiatives to compensate
for the U.S. disengage-ment. Most Asian countries have participated in
the China dominated Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and BRI.
**[While the US military capa-bilities still dominate Asia, China has
wielded growing leverage, pulling longtime American allies
closer.]{.underline}**

In this case, as Jeffery Bader argues, **[if the US goes down "the road
of disengagement from China]{.underline}** in pursuit of unbridled
competition, **[it will not be a repetition of the Cold
War]{.underline}** with the Soviet Union, when the United States was
joined by a phalanx of Western and democratic countries determined to
join us in isolating the USSR". Deeply entangling with China
economically, "**[Even those most wary of Beijing, like Japan, India,
and Australia, will not risk economic ties with China nor join in a
perverse struggle to re-erect the "bamboo curtain"]{.underline}**, this
time by the West. **[We will be on our own]{.underline}**" \[Bader
2018\].

Although China's rise has inevitably increased frictions, engagement has
helped avoid potentially disastrous US---China confrontation by giving
China a continuing stake in the relationship with the US and its
neighbors. **[It is in China's interest to work with the US because
China is far from the position to step into America's shoes as a
hegemonic power and take the role of global leadership. Global
leader-ship is costly; it means asking people to contribute to others'
well-being and send soldiers to die]{.underline}** far from home.
Seeking reform of global governance, **[Beijing has yet to mount serious
responses to global problems, such as the refugee crisis or Syria's
civil war. China's rise is not necessarily America's de-cline. While it
becomes difficult for the US to hold its primacy in Asia, it is equally,
if not more diffi-cult, for China to drive the US out of Asia anytime
soon.]{.underline}** Uncomfortable with the US dominance, China,
nevertheless, benefited immensely from the US-led order underpinning
stability and prosperity in the region. Beijing has already paid a price
for its con-frontational policy alienating the US. China would benefit
from friendly rather than hostile relations with the US and nations on
its borders.

**[It is not in China's interest to escalate tensions with the US also
because a Sino-American show-down may risk dooming China's economic
transition and political stability]{.underline}**. After remarkable GDP
growth for many years, China has experienced difficult transition from
reliance on low-cost manufacturing and exporting products to high-tech
innovations and consumption-driven economy. Beijing has made clear that
it does not want to fight the trade war that would harm the Chinese
economy much more than the American economy. **[No alternative is as big
and lucrative as the American market for China's export.]{.underline}**
In addition, China's tight import control has hurt not only American
producers but also Chinese consumers. Ordinary Chinese would welcome
re-duced import tariffs, which means cheaper foreign products and
services for the average Chinese con-sumers \[Xie 2018\].

### Not Key to Relations

#### Arms sales won't spillover -- purely symbolic

US arms sales to Taiwan continue to generate considerable anger in
Beijing. When the United States confirmed a US\$5.8 billion weapons
package to Taiwan in 2011, for instance, official Chinese media referred
to the sale as a \"despicable breach of faith in international
relations,\" while one general wrote that the US was \"cheating and
making a fool of the Chinese people.\"6 In early 2010, PRC officials
were \"strongly indig- nant\" after an arms sale announcement, calling
such sales a \"gross inter- vention in China\'s internal affairs\" that
would have a \"serious negative impact\" on bilateral relations.7

suggested that Washington consider reducing its commitment to
Taiwan]{.underline}**. Often, recognizing the raw nerve that arms sales
touch in China, these calls emphasize in particular the desirability of
the US scaling back its weapons sales to Taipei.8

**[Proponents]{.underline}** of this view, however, **[largely take it
on face value that US arms sales to Taiwan do in fact act as a
significant constraint on US- China cooperation.]{.underline}**9 Yet,
**[despite the strong emotional response arms sales to Taiwan often
generate in China, it is not obvious that these sales have a major
effect on the broader US-China relationship. On the contrary, China has
typically been reluctant to retaliate strongly in response to US arms
sales; rather, Beijing has tended to take more symbolic, temporary,
actions-such as freezing military exchanges and postponing official
visits.]{.underline}**10 Given the importance China attaches to the
Taiwan issue, it strikes us as somewhat puzzling that the typical PRC
response to US arms sales hasn\'t been more forceful, especially since
Beijing has been willing to retaliate against other countries and in
other issue areas when its interests are threatened. In the past, for
instance, China was willing to sanction both the Netherlands and France
for selling weapons to Taiwan, and both countries ultimately reversed
course on the issue.11 More recently, China reacted strongly to the 2010
Japanese arrest of a Chinese fishing boat skipper near the disputed
Diaoyu/Senkaku islands, and has retali- ated against Norway for the
awarding of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo
(\...).12 And China has at times been willing to retaliate against
Washington when US actions threaten Chinese interests in other issue
areas. After the US levied tariffs on Chinese tires in 2009, for
instance, China quickly responded by imposing tariffs on US automobile
products and chicken meat.13

Likewise, **[it is not self-evident how large of a signaling effect arms
sales have]{.underline}**. As we show in the next section, **[US arms
sales send the clearest signal of US support for Taiwan when the sales
are costly for the United States to undertake. Yet it is quite clear not
only that the sales do not appear to be especially costly for Washington
but also that many in the United States actually benefit economically
and politically from the sales.]{.underline}** When the Obama
administration was considering the F-16C/D package in 2011, for
instance, a large number of US senators signed a letter to the president
urging the sale to go forward; often, the signatories represented states
that stood to benefit economically from increased demand for the fighter
jets.21 In other words, **[so long as Chinese retaliation against the
United States for selling weapons remains limited, the costs of the
policy to Washington do not appear especially high. Thus it would not
appear to us that arms sales represent an especially strong signal of US
commitment to Taiwan, meaning that ending the sales would not
necessarily lead Taiwan and China to dramatically alter their
assessments of likely US behavior in the event of a cross-Strait
conflict.]{.underline}**

#### US arms sales to Taiwan aren't symbolic of security commitment -- seen as more economically driven

Second, **[it is not clear that selling weapons to a partner necessarily
makes it more likely that the seller is then willing to fight a war on
its buyer's behalf.]{.underline}**155 **[Weapons sales are the opposite
of a costly signal]{.underline}**, **[because]{.underline}**
**[selling]{.underline}** weapons **[is actually quite
profitable]{.underline}**. Since **[Chinese]{.underline}**
**[leaders]{.underline}** know the United States makes money on weapons
sales, they **[might believe that weapons sales signal little more than
a U.S. President's desire to support America's defense
industries.]{.underline}**

To be fair, **[Taiwan's leaders likely see weapons sales as the next
best alternative to basing U.S. troops in Taiwan]{.underline}**, since
cross-Strait dynamics seem to prevent the United States from sending
traditional costly signals. **[Nor are weapons sales costless for the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. At a minimum, **[they
demonstrate that the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[is willing to tolerate the Chinese indignation and retaliation that
usually follow each U.S.-Taiwan foreign military sales
announcement.]{.underline}**

**[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, we think **[it is risky for Taiwan to
spend its limited defense budget on expensive U.S. weapons systems on
the tenuous assumption that it signals American willingness to go to war
on Taiwan's behalf. The issue of whether the United States would
intervene in a war between Taiwan and China remains
contentious.]{.underline}** From a historical perspective, the **[U.S.
commitment to Taiwan has been waning from the days of the Mutual Defense
Treaty with Taiwan.]{.underline}** Although public and elite opinion on
the matter has ebbed and flowed over the past four decades, **[the
general trend appears to cast increasing doubt on U.S. intervention.
Many U.S. citizens appear to think that the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[should use Taiwan as a bargaining chip to
improve relations with China]{.underline}**.156

### Alt Cause -- Generic

#### There's a laundry list of other issues between the US and China outside of arms sales to Taiwan and these are driving US disengagement strategy

**Bader, 2018**

(Jeffrey A., Senior Fellow in Foreign Policy at the John L. Thornton
China Center, "U.S.-China relations: Is it time to end the engagement?",

accessed 6/25/19, ZW)

**[The harbingers of a strategy of disengagement are]{.underline}** all
around us, some in U.S. government statements and policy, but others
**[more broadly in American society and the media:]{.underline}** • The
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration**['s]{.underline}** imposition of
**[tariffs on Chinese imports]{.underline}** is designed to wean
Americans off of Chinese imports and encourage changes in corporate
supply chains to exclude China. President Trump seems to favor a radical
drop in U.S.-China trade under the single-minded assumption that it will
reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China, without regard to collateral
negative consequences. • **[The Congress and
administration]{.underline}** are **[strengthening controls on Chinese
investment in the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, which
already began shrinking dramatically in 2017. • **[Export controls on
dual-use technologies to China]{.underline}** are **[being
tightened]{.underline}**. • The **[Chinese presence on U.S. campuses is
under attack. The number of Chinese students applying to study in the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[is falling, and
restrictions on access to]{.underline}** science, technology,
engineering, and mathematics (**[STEM]{.underline}**) **[disciplines are
being discussed and prepared.]{.underline}** Indeed, **[there reportedly
was a White House memo discussed with the president calling for a ban on
all Chinese students in the United States, which was fortunately
rejected.]{.underline}** Donations to universities and think tanks by
Chinese individuals and companies, even from Hong Kong, are increasingly
being turned down under political pressure or due to pre-emptive
capitulation by institutions worried about reputational damage.
Confucius Institutes teaching Chinese language and culture on campuses
are under attack because of their affiliation with the Chinese
government, and some have been forced to close. • **[Some legislators
are proposing to shut down or limit Chinese media outlets reporting or
broadcasting in the United States.]{.underline}** (Since World War II,
the United States has favored aggressive broadcasting into authoritarian
countries and opposed barriers to U.S. outlets operating abroad, at the
same time not fearing American susceptibility to foreign propaganda. The
new favored approach seems to be to try to build soundproof walls,
rather than to facilitate free messaging.) • **[Military-to-military
exchanges and joint exercises have been curtailed or suspended, as
demonstrated by China's disinvitation to the 2018]{.underline}** Rim of
the Pacific (**[RIMPAC]{.underline}**) **[naval exercise.]{.underline}**

### Alt Cause -- North Korea/Trade

#### Multiple alternate causes for poor relations -- North Korea and trade

**[Looking into the near future of the U.S.-China relations, one needs
to keep in mind that President Trump\'s priorities are the trade and
North Korea issues. Trump\'s blaming of China as an \"economic enemy\"
and]{.underline}** his decision to impose **[tariffs]{.underline}** on
\$34 billion worth of Chinese products as the first step in the trade
conflict with Beijing, followed by the unusual passage of U.S. warships
through the Taiwan Strait amid the heightened tensions, **[convey a
clear message.]{.underline}**62 It is natural that **[Trump
appointed]{.underline}** some **[hardliners as his high-ranking trade
officials]{.underline}**, including the U.S. Secretary of Commerce
Wilbur Ross, the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and the
Director of the White House National Trade Council Peter Navarro, all
advocates for tougher stances toward China on the trade issue. **[The
Korean Peninsula nuclear issue is another critical one that the two
powers find their interests not all convergent]{.underline}**. The Trump
administration\'s resoluteness to push China on these two critical
issues is reflected in U.S. National Security Strategy released at the
end of 2017 and the 2018 National Defense Strategy, in which China is
labeled as one of America\'s major \"strategic competitors,\" along with
Russia, on both economic and military fronts.63 For the first time since
World War II the United States claims that \"we are emerging from a
period of strategic atrophy\" and \"that our competitive military
advantage has been eroding,\" rendering Washington-Beijing ties
preoccupied with more fierce competition vis-à-vis strategic cooperation
in the years down the road.64 This does not suggest that China-U.S.
relations are doomed to be pessimistic \[End Page 196\] as the two
powers are comprehensively interdependent and without China\'s
cooperation America can achieve limited outcomes in global affairs. What
it means is that more efforts and dialogues are indispensable for making
a working relationship between the two countries.

### Alt Cause -- Trade

#### Alt cause -- trade war decks US-China relations -- Wasp docking denial proves

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) ― **[China]{.underline}** has **[denied a
request for a U.S. warship to visit Hong Kong]{.underline}**, the U.S.
consulate in the Chinese city said on Tuesday, **[amid rising tension
between Beijing and Washington over trade and a U.S. decision to
sanction the Asian nation's military.]{.underline}**

**[The]{.underline}** amphibious assault ship **[Wasp had been due to
make a port call in]{.underline}** the former British colony of **[Hong
Kong]{.underline}** in October, diplomatic sources said.

"The Chinese Government did not approve a request for a U.S. port visit
to Hong Kong by the USS Wasp," a consulate spokeswoman said.

**["We have a long track record of successful port visits to Hong Kong,
and we expect that to continue,"]{.underline}** she added.

In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang did not directly
answer a question on whether China had denied the request.

"For requests for U.S. military ships to visit Hong Kong, China has
always carried out approvals case by case, in accordance with the
principle of sovereignty and the detailed situation," he told reporters,
without elaborating.

In 2016, at a time of heightened tension over its territorial claims in
the disputed South China Sea, China denied a request for a U.S. carrier
strike group led by the John C. Stennis to visit Hong Kong.

### Warming Inevitable -- Trump Administration

#### No solvency -- Trump administration is rolling back CCP provisions and refuses to acknowledge climate change as a threat

**Miller,** 6/23/**19**

(Hayley, reporter for HuffPost, "Mike Pence Claims Trump Administration

The **[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[rolled back that key
provision]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}**
Obama administration's 2015 **[C]{.underline}**lean
**[P]{.underline}**ower **[P]{.underline}**lan last week, **[which
targeted coal plants by setting specific greenhouse gas emissions cuts
for each state.]{.underline}**

**[The E]{.underline}**nvironmental **[P]{.underline}**rotection
**[A]{.underline}**gency**['s]{.underline}** recently announced
**[rule]{.underline}** **[allows state regulators to decide how
utilities can limit carbon emissions]{.underline}** **[and does not
require companies to switch from coal to more sustainable energy
sources]{.underline}**.

**[Experts say the new rule cuts carbon emissions from power plants by
less than half of what is needed to avoid catastrophic global
warming]{.underline}**, reported The Washington Post.

**[Pence]{.underline}** on Sunday **[complained]{.underline}** that
**[the C]{.underline}**lean **[P]{.underline}**ower
**[P]{.underline}**lan **[was "hamstringing energy in this country"
while countries like China and India have failed to do their part in
reducing carbon emissions]{.underline}**.

"You know, the truth of the matter," **[Pence]{.underline}**
**[said]{.underline}** before making several demonstrably false
statements, "is with the advent of natural gas, **[with]{.underline}**
the **[natural gas]{.underline}** explosion that is developing, **[with
clean coal]{.underline}** technology, **[we're seeing a significant
reduction in carbon emissions]{.underline}** all across this country."

**[Not only does "clean coal" not exist]{.underline}**, carbon emissions
in the U.S. actually surged last year. The **[emissions had been
decreasing over the last several years, but jumped 3.4% in
2018]{.underline}** ― the second largest increase of this type since
1996, reported ProPublica.

Tapper on Sunday continued to press Pence about whether he believes
man-made climate change is a threat, but the vice president danced
around the question.

"I think the answer to that is going to be based upon the science,"
Pence said. "Look, what the president has said, what we have said is
that we're not going to raise utility rates."

"OK, so you don't think it is a threat?" Tapper asked.

**[Pence then declared that "America has the cleanest air and water in
the world,"]{.underline}** prompting the CNN host to burst into
laughter.

"That is not true," Tapper said. "We don't have the cleanest air and
water in the world. \... You get back to me with some statistics that
show it."

#### Even Trump's National Security Council attempts to interfere with NASA's findings on climate change

**[In]{.underline}** a March 3 **[email]{.underline}** exchange,
**[Happer and Hal Doiron]{.underline}**, another policy adviser to
Heartland, **[discuss]{.underline}** Happer's **[scientific arguments in
a paper attempting to knock down the contributions of fossil fuel
emissions in climate disruption]{.underline}**, as well as ideas to make
the work "more useful to a wider readership." Happer writes he had
already discussed the work with another Heartland adviser, Wysmuller.

**[Academic experts denounced the administration official's continued
involvement with groups and scientists who reject what numerous federal
agencies say is the fact of man-made climate change.]{.underline}**

"These people are endangering all of us by promoting anti-science in
service of fossil fuel interests over the American interests," said
Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann.

**["It's the equivalent to formulating anti-terrorism policy by
consulting with groups that deny terrorism exists,"]{.underline}** said
Northeastern University's Matthew Nisbet, a professor of environmental
communication and public policy.

The National Security Council declined to make Happer available to
discuss the emails.

The AP and others reported this year that Happer was coordinating a
proposed White House panel to challenge the findings from scientists in
and out of government that carbon emissions are altering the Earth's
atmosphere and climate.

**[Trump in November rejected the warnings of a national climate change
assessment by more than a dozen government agencies.]{.underline}**

"I don't believe it," he said.

**[Happer]{.underline}**, a physicist who previously taught at Princeton
University, has **[claimed that carbon dioxide]{.underline}**, the main
heat-trapping gas from the burning of coal, oil and gas, **[is good for
humans and that carbon emissions have been demonized like "the poor Jews
under Hitler."]{.underline}**

**[The emails show Happer expressing surprise that
Bridenstine]{.underline}**, a former Oklahoma congressman, had **[put
his skepticism of global-warming science behind him before becoming NASA
chief]{.underline}** in April 2018.

Bridenstine a year ago told reporters that after reading Defense
Department briefings on global warming, he became convinced it is a
serious national security problem: "We're defending territory in the
Arctic that we never had to defend. The Russians are doing things in the
Arctic that they never used to be able to do."

He said no other agency has NASA's credibility when it comes to studying
climate change and helping policymakers form decisions about it.

**[Two major U.S. science organizations took issue with Happer's
emails.]{.underline}**

**["We have concerns that there appear to be attempts by a member of the
National Security Council to influence and interfere with the ability of
NASA, a federal science agency, to communicate accurately about research
findings on climate science,"]{.underline}** said Rush Holt, chief
executive officer of the American Association for the Advance of
Science, the world's largest general scientific society.

#### AND, the USDA prevented press releases on the negative effects of climate change on crops

**Pitofsky, 6-24-19**

**[The USDA declined to issue press releases or announcements on more
than 45 peer-reviewed studies that were cleared through the nonpartisan
Agricultural Research Service]{.underline}**, Politico reported on
Sunday. **[The studies all point to the potential effects of climate
change, ranging from the discovery that rice loses vitamins in a
carbon-rich environment to a warning that increased temperatures could
boost pollen levels and intensify allergy season]{.underline}**,
according to the news outlet.

Politico found that **[the Agricultural Research Service has issued two
releases directly related to climate change since the start of Trump's
term in 2017 --- one finding that beef production only contributes
minimally to greenhouse gas emissions and another that not eating animal
products could cause nutritional problems.]{.underline}**

**[Another press release on soy processing reportedly called reducing
fossil fuel use or emissions "a personal consideration" for
farmers.]{.underline}**

**["The intent is to try to suppress a message --- in this case, the
increasing danger of human-caused climate change,"]{.underline}**
Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University who
is known for taking on climate skeptics, told Politico. **["Who loses
out? The people, who are already suffering the impacts of sea level rise
and unprecedented super storms, droughts, wildfires and heat
waves.\"]{.underline}**

Politico also reported that **[researchers at the University of
Washington who collaborated with the USDA to study how carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere could affect rice for more than two years were told there
"was not enough data" to publicize the study, even after the department
prepared its own announcement.]{.underline}**

### Cyber Defense

#### Cyberattacks impossible -- empirics and defenses solve

**[Rid 12]{.underline}** (Thomas Rid, reader in war studies at King\'s
College London, is author of \"Cyber War Will Not Take Place\" and
co-author of \"Cyber-Weapons.\", March/April 2012, "Think Again:
Cyberwar",
http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/02/27/cyberwar?page=full)

\"Cyberwar Is Already Upon Us.\" No way. \"**[Cyberwar is
coming]{.underline}**!\" John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt predicted in a
celebrated Rand paper back in 1993. Since then, **[it seems to have
arrived]{.underline}** \-- at least by the account of the U.S. military
establishment, which is busy competing over who should get what share of
the fight. Cyberspace is \"a domain in which the Air Force flies and
fights,\" Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne claimed in 2006. By 2012,
William J. Lynn III, the deputy defense secretary at the time, was
writing that **[cyberwar is \"just as critical to military operations as
land, sea, air, and space]{.underline}**.\" In January, the Defense
Department vowed to equip the U.S. armed forces for \"conducting a
combined arms campaign across all domains \-- land, air, maritime,
space, and cyberspace.\" Meanwhile, growing piles of books and articles
explore the threats of cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, and how to survive
them. **[Time for a reality check: Cyberwar is still more hype than
hazard]{.underline}**. Consider the definition of an act of
**[war]{.underline}**: It **[has to be potentially
violent]{.underline}**, it has to be **[purposeful]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}** it has to be **[political]{.underline}**. **[The
cyberattacks we\'ve seen so far]{.underline}**, from Estonia to the
Stuxnet virus, **[simply don\'t meet these criteria]{.underline}**. Take
the dubious story of a Soviet pipeline explosion back in 1982, much
cited by cyberwar\'s true believers as **[the most destructive
cyberattack ever]{.underline}**. The account goes like this: In June
1982, a Siberian pipeline that the CIA had virtually booby-trapped with
a so-called \"logic bomb\" exploded in a monumental fireball that could
be seen from space. The U.S. Air Force estimated the explosion at 3
kilotons, equivalent to a small nuclear device. Targeting a Soviet
pipeline linking gas fields in Siberia to European markets, the
operation sabotaged the pipeline\'s control systems with software from a
Canadian firm that the CIA had doctored with malicious code. **[No one
died]{.underline}**, according to Thomas Reed, a U.S. National Security
Council aide at the time who revealed the incident in his 2004 book, At
the Abyss; **[the only harm came to the Soviet economy]{.underline}**.
But did it really happen? **[After Reed\'s account came
out]{.underline}**, Vasily Pchelintsev, a former KGB **[head of the
Tyumen region]{.underline}**, **[where the alleged
explosion]{.underline}** supposedly **[took place, denied the
story.There are also no media reports from 1982 that confirm such an
explosion, though accidents and pipeline explosions in the Soviet Union
were regularly reported in the early 1980s.]{.underline}** Something
likely did happen, but **[Reed\'s book is the only public mention of the
incident and his account relied on a single document]{.underline}**.
Even after the CIA declassified a redacted version of Reed\'s source,
**[a note]{.underline}** on the so-called Farewell Dossier that
**[describes the effort to provide the Soviet Union with defective
technology]{.underline}**, **[the agency did not confirm that such an
explosion occurred]{.underline}**. **[The available evidence on the
Siberian pipeline blast is so thin that it shouldn\'t be counted as a
proven case of a successful cyberattack]{.underline}**. **[Most other
commonly cited cases of cyberwar are even less
remarkable]{.underline}**. Take **[the attacks on Estonia]{.underline}**
in April 2007, which **[came in response to the controversial relocation
of a Soviet war memorial]{.underline}**, the Bronze Soldier. The
well-wired country found itself at the receiving end of a massive
distributed denial-of-service attack that emanated from up to 85,000
hijacked computers and lasted three weeks. The attacks reached a peak on
May 9, when 58 Estonian websites were attacked at once and the online
services of Estonia\'s largest bank were taken down. \"What\'s the
difference between a blockade of harbors or airports of sovereign states
and the blockade of government institutions and newspaper websites?\"
asked Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip. Despite his analogies,
**[the attack was no act of war. It was certainly a nuisance and an
emotional strike on the country, but the bank\'s actual network was not
even penetrated; it went down for 90 minutes one day and two hours the
next]{.underline}**. **[The attack was not violent, it wasn\'t
purposefully aimed at changing Estonia\'s behavior, and no political
entity took credit for it]{.underline}**. **[The same is true for the
vast majority of cyberattacks on record]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[there
is no known cyberattack that has caused the loss of human
life]{.underline}**.**[No cyberoffense has ever injured a person or
damaged a building]{.underline}**. And **[if an act is not at least
potentially violent, it\'s not an act of war]{.underline}**. Separating
war from physical violence makes it a metaphorical notion; it would mean
that there is no way to distinguish between World War II, say, and the
\"wars\" on obesity and cancer. Yet those ailments, unlike past examples
of cyber \"war,\" actually do kill people. \"**[A Digital Pearl Harbor
Is Only a Matter of Time]{.underline}**.\" **[Keep
waiting]{.underline}**. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta delivered a
stark warning last summer: \"We could face a cyberattack that could be
the equivalent of Pearl Harbor.\" Such **[alarmist predictions have been
ricocheting inside the Beltway for the past two decades]{.underline}**,
an**[d some scaremongers have even upped the ante by raising the alarm
about a cyber 9/11.]{.underline}** In his 2010 book, Cyber War, former
White House counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke invokes the specter of
nationwide power blackouts, planes falling out of the sky, trains
derailing, refineries burning, pipelines exploding, poisonous gas clouds
wafting, and satellites spinning out of orbit \-- events that would make
the 2001 attacks pale in comparison. But **[the empirical record is less
hair-raising, even by the standards of the most drastic example
available]{.underline}**. Gen. Keith Alexander, head of U.S. Cyber
Command (established in 2010 and now boasting a budget of more than \$3
billion), shared his worst fears in an April 2011 speech at the
University of Rhode Island: \"What I\'m concerned about are destructive
attacks,\" Alexander said, \"those that are coming.\" He then invoked a
remarkable accident at Russia\'s Sayano-Shushenskaya hydroelectric plant
to highlight the kind of damage a cyberattack might be able to cause.
Shortly after midnight on Aug. 17, 2009, a 900-ton turbine was ripped
out of its seat by a so-called \"water hammer,\" a sudden surge in water
pressure that then caused a transformer explosion. The turbine\'s
unusually high vibrations had worn down the bolts that kept its cover in
place, and an offline sensor failed to detect the malfunction.
Seventy-five people died in the accident, energy prices in Russia rose,
and rebuilding the plant is slated to cost \$1.3 billion. Tough luck for
the Russians, but here\'s what the head of Cyber Command didn\'t say:
The ill-fated turbine had been malfunctioning for some time, and the
plant\'s management was notoriously poor. On top of that, the key event
that ultimately triggered the catastrophe seems to have been a fire at
Bratsk power station, about 500 miles away. Because the energy supply
from Bratsk dropped, authorities remotely increased the burden on the
Sayano-Shushenskaya plant. The sudden spike overwhelmed the turbine,
which was two months shy of reaching the end of its 30-year life cycle,
sparking the catastrophe. If anything, **[the
Sayano]{.underline}**-Shushenskaya **[incident highlights how difficult
a devastating attack would be to mount]{.underline}**.**[The plant\'s
washout was an accident at the end of a complicated and unique chain of
events]{.underline}**. **[Anticipatingsuch vulnerabilities in advance is
extraordinarilydifficulteven for insiders;creating comparable
coincidences from cyberspace would be a daunting challenge at best for
outsiders]{.underline}**. If this is the most drastic incident Cyber
Command can conjure up, perhaps it\'s time for everyone to take a deep
breath. \"**[Cyberattacks Are Becoming Easier]{.underline}**.\" **[Just
the opposite]{.underline}**. U.S. Director of National Intelligence
James R. **[Clapper warned last year that the volume of malicious
software on American networks had more than tripled since
2009]{.underline}** and that more than 60,000 pieces of malware are now
discovered every day. **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, he said, **[is undergoing \"a phenomenon known
as \'convergence,]{.underline}**\' **[which amplifies the opportunity
for disruptive cyberattacks]{.underline}**, including against physical
infrastructures.\" (\"Digital convergence\" is a snazzy term for a
simple thing: more and more devices able to talk to each other, and
formerly separate industries and activities able to work together.)
**[Just because there\'s more malware]{.underline}**, however,
**[doesn\'t mean that attacks are becoming easier]{.underline}**. In
fact, **[potentially damaging or life-threatening cyberattacks should be
more difficult to pull off]{.underline}**. Why? **[Sensitive systems
generally have built-in redundancy and safety systems, meaning an
attacker\'s likely objective will not be to shut down a
system]{.underline}**, **[since merely forcing the shutdown of one
control system]{.underline}**, say a power plant, **[could trigger a
backup and cause operators to start looking for the bug.To work as an
effective weapon, malware would have to influence an active process\--
but not bring it to a screeching halt. If the malicious activity extends
over a lengthy period, it has to remain stealthy]{.underline}**.
**[That\'s a more difficult trick than hitting the virtual
off-button.]{.underline}** Take **[Stuxnet]{.underline}**, the worm that
sabotaged Iran\'s nuclear program in 2010. It **[didn\'t just crudely
shut down the centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear facility]{.underline}**;
rather**[, the worm subtly manipulated the system]{.underline}**.
Stuxnet stealthily infiltrated the plant\'s networks, then hopped onto
the protected control systems, intercepted input values from sensors,
recorded these data, and then provided the legitimate controller code
with pre-recorded fake input signals, according to researchers who have
studied the worm. Its objective was not just to fool operators in a
control room, but also to circumvent digital safety and monitoring
systems so it could secretly manipulate the actual processes.
**[Building and deploying Stuxnet required extremely detailed
intelligence about the systems it was supposed to
compromise]{.underline}**, **[and the same will be true for other
dangerous cyberweapons.]{.underline}** Yes, \"**[convergence,\"
standardization, and sloppy defense of control-systems software could
increase the risk of generic attacks, but the same trend has also caused
defenses against the most coveted targets to improve steadily and has
made reprogramming highly specific installations on legacy systems more
complex, not less]{.underline}**.

#### No escalation

**Rid, 13** - non-resident fellow at Johns Hopkins SAIS and a reader in
the Department of War Studies at Kings College, London (Thomas, "Cyber
War Will Not Take Place, Or Will It?" September 9, 2013
http://www.brookings.edu/\~/media/events/2013/9/09%20cyber%20war/20130909_cyberwar_transcript.pdf

**[Using cyber capabilities is not producing more violence, as this
label of cyber war would lead us to think, that's the core argument,
it's not producing more violence, it in fact takes \-- oftentimes takes
violence and physical risk out of the question.]{.underline}** So, I'll
very briefly give you three reasons, three illustrations of this
argument, and I think then we should already move into the discussion.
First, perhaps the most consequential use of computer attack is
sabotage. Attacking a system, and when I say system, it can be all sorts
of things, in order to degrade its efficiency or possibly damage the
system \-- sabotage, that's sort of where sabotage comes from in the
early 9 20th century, withdrawing efficiency from a system. In previous
times, if you sabotaged a system, say, by throwing a monkey wrench \--
that's the American equivalent to the sabot, the French wooden shoe that
strikers would throw into machines, if you like \-- if you throw sand or
mechanical devices into a machine in order to sabotage it, in that
classical context, then you would damage the machine, you would damage
property. You would actually, if you like, do something violent because
it damages something mechanically, physically. **[Today, in the context
of cyber attacks, it is easier to distinguish between violent sabotage,
because for violent effects you would have to weaponize the target
system, like Stuxnet did, with very arcane payloads.]{.underline}** It's
easier to distinguish violent sabotage from nonviolent sabotage. So, for
instance, the Saudi Aramco attack in 2012 and the Saudi oil company was
sabotaged, was entirely nonviolent, but it was highly effective, of
course. So, that is an interesting distinction to make that nonviolent
sabotage has become possible and probably also easier. **[Violent
sabotage may have become more, shall we say, intelligence
intensive.]{.underline}** That's a point to be discussed, perhaps later.
Second, very quickly, intelligence operations, espionage operations,
here also I think in this day and age, as we are learning as a result of
the ongoing revelations post-10 Snowden, intelligence operations and
espionage in the 21st century can exploit this new technical environment
in ways that were practically unimaginable only a generation ago.
(Inaudible) before the Internet was already impressive, but with the
Internet the possibilities of (inaudible), of extra trading information
from a target, without the target noticing, are drastically increased.
So, again, the same thing, in order to exploit espionage in the cyber
context, if you like, you can \--probably you have to take less risk,
you may not even have to infiltrate physically \-- you may not have to
infiltrate a target to plant bugs, you may not have to recruit agents in
order to help you on the ground. It can be done remotely. Not always,
but often. That also makes it easier \-- **[it, in a way, takes out
physical risk, takes out potential violence, not adding more to cyber
operations]{.underline}**. And very quickly, the third feature if you
look at subversion, is undermining political authority. Here we've also
seen that a new communication environment can be used to undermine
authority effectively without first resorting to political violence,
without going to use terrorist tactics in order to undermine the
legitimacy of a government that's very much taking us into the realm of
counterterrorism and really counterinsurgency theory, but you can use
\-- you can influence public opinion even if you're not a powerful media
organization, in more effective 11 ways today. That's an entirely
separate problem, subversion. Now, here also violence becomes more
problematic blurred. This, in a nutshell is the book's core argument
that **[violence changes its shape.]{.underline}** Let me, perhaps,
close my short opening remarks by responding to an argument that I know
from experience at least ten **[people in this room now have in their
head. They think, well, maybe we should adapt the notion of violence,
maybe we should adapt the notion of what counts as war,]{.underline}**
as a use of force, to the 21st century, maybe we have to \-- why use
Clausewitz? The guy's been dead for 130-something years. Shouldn't we be
a little more progressive here? To which I would respond, we have not
updated our notions of what is violence, what is war, with the rise of
air power, which hasn't been around when Clausewitz was around. We
haven't updated our notion of war with the arrival of nuclear weapons,
necessarily. Ultimately, and I appreciate that some of you here in this
room may have served in warzones, who experienced political violence in
other contexts. I think, and I say this as somebody also who is teaching
in the Department of War Studies, we have to respect violence, we have
to respect war in a fundamental, existential way. **[So, exfiltrating
data, even crashing an entire company's network, and physically
disabling data, is 12 different from hurting, injuring, and killing
human beings, even a single one, and I think that's a fundamental
philosophical distinction that we have to keep in mind, I think, and we
owe it to those who have had that experience, in a way.]{.underline}**

#### No impact to cyberattacks -- empirics -- their ev is fear-mongering

Cyber Realities, AND \*Senior Lecturer in Social and Political Sciences

Resilience Studies at Northeastern University (Brandon and Ryan C., The
Coming Cyberpeace: The Normative Argument Against Cyberwarfare, Foreign
Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2015-05-13/coming-cyberpeace)

The era of cyberconflict is upon us; at least, experts seem to accept
that cyberattacks are the new normal. In fact, however, [evidence
suggests that cyberconflict is not as prevalent as many
believe.]{.underline} Likewise, [the severity of individual cyber events
is not increasing, even if the frequency of overall attacks has
risen.]{.underline} And an [**emerging norm against the use of severe
state-based cybertactics** contradicts fear-mongering news reports about
a coming cyberapocalypse]{.underline}. The few [isolated incidents of
successful state-based cyberattacks do **not a trend**
make]{.underline}. Rather, what we are seeing is cyberespionage and
probes, not cyberwarfare. Meanwhile, [the international consensus has
stabilized around a number of limited acceptable uses of
cybertechnology---one that prohibits any dangerous use of
force.]{.underline} [**Despite fears of a boom in cyberwarfare**, there
have been **no major or dangerous hacks** between
countries.]{.underline} The closest any states have come to such events
occurred when Russia attacked Georgian news outlets and websites in
2008; when Russian forces shut down banking, government, and news
websites in Estonia in 2007; when Iran attacked the Saudi Arabian oil
firm Saudi Aramco with the Shamoon virus in 2012; and when the United
States attempted to sabotage Iran's nuclear power systems from 2007 to
2011 through the Stuxnet worm. [The attack on **Sony from North Korea**
is just the latest overhyped cyberattack to date, as the corporate giant
has recovered its lost revenues from the attack and its networks are
arguably more resilient as a result.]{.underline} [Even these are more
probes into vulnerabilities than full attacks]{.underline}. Russia's
aggressions show that [**Moscow** is willing to use cyberwarfare for
disruption and propaganda, but not to inflict injuries or lasting
infrastructural damage.]{.underline} The Shamoon incident allowed
**[Iran]{.underline}** to punish Saudi Arabia for its alliance with the
United States as Tehran faced increased sanctions; the [attack destroyed
files on Saudi Aramco's computer network but **failed to do any lasting
damage**.]{.underline} The **[Stuxnet]{.underline}** incident also
[failed to create any lasting damage]{.underline}, as Tehran put more
centrifuges online to compensate for virus-based losses and strengthened
holes in their system. Further, [these supposedly successful cases of
cyberattacks are balanced by **many more examples of unsuccessful
ones**. If the future of cyberconflict looks like today, the
international community must **reassess the severity of the
threat.**]{.underline} [Cyberattacks have demonstrated themselves to be
**more smoke than fire**.]{.underline} This is not to suggest that
incidents are on the decline, however. Distributed denial-of-service
attacks and infiltrations increase by the minute---every major
organization is probed constantly, but only for weaknesses or new
infiltration methods for potential use in the future. [Probes and pokes
do not destabilize states or change trends within international
politics. Even common cyber actions have little effect on levels of
cooperation and conflict between states.]{.underline}

**[Once every four days in the United States, a physical or cyber-attack
on the nation\'s electrical grid]{.underline}** causes an electrical
emergency or disturbance -- highlighting the growing threat of a
constant siege on the country\'s energy sources. **[Since 2011 there
have been more than 350 such incidents reported to the U.S. Department
of Energy]{.underline}**. Even though most are short-lived incidents,
they are indicative of serious security vulnerabilities that analysts
and officials fear could be exploited by bad actors to create a
cascading blackout that could leave millions of people without power for
days. Problems range from lack of security cameras and opaque fencing
around transformers and other important equipment and facilities to
inadequate cyber-security measures within the computer networks used to
control the grid. Southwest Ohio is no exception. Area energy providers
and utility regulators say they have taken action to make sure any such
attacks remain minor issues. **[Over the past four years, Southwest Ohio
has dealt with six physical attacks on the electrical
grid]{.underline}**. In data compiled by USA TODAY, 362 incidents were
reported between January 2011 and December 2014 to the U.S. Department
of Energy; in Southwest Ohio, Duke Energy reported five of these
incidents.

## Warming Defense

### 1NC -- Inevitable 

#### Warming inevitable and unavoidable -- we're locked in for 5 degrees 

**Thomas 17** (Evan; Student at University of Missouri-Columbia, and

Planet Is Inevitable, New Research Finds The planet will heat up,

**[Scientists have warned for years that an increase in global
temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius could cause dangerous weather
patterns]{.underline}**, crunch the global food supply and force entire
populations to migrate. Now, **[new research suggests a lot of that
warming is unavoidable]{.underline}** **[--- no matter how much we cut
emissions. Studies usually use models to forecast climate behavior, but
this time, researchers at the]{.underline}** **[University of
Colorado]{.underline}** in Boulder **[looked at \"things that have
already happened\" to the planet. They weighed variables like the
particulates in the air and what oceans do when they absorb
carbon]{.underline}**. They said **[even if we turned off everything
that creates carbon dioxide]{.underline}** **[tomorrow]{.underline}**,
global temperatures will still be higher by the end of the century.
**[They found there\'s a 13 percent chance Earth is already committed to
a climate that\'s 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer.]{.underline}**
**[Scientists at the University of Washington have an even more grim
projection based on 50 years of economic and population
trends.]{.underline}** **[There\'s a 90 percent chance temperatures will
climb by at least 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the
century]{.underline}** **[--- and they could get almost 5 degrees
higher.]{.underline}** The carbon impact per dollar of gross world
product has dropped in recent years, but that trend could reverse when
the economy must support 11 billion people. Experts agree **[we can
still slow down warming, but the University of Washington team says we
need \"an abrupt change of course.\" The Paris climate agreement won\'t
be enough]{.underline}**. Even before this new research was published,
**[the U.N. expected countries would have to cut 25 percent more
emissions than agreed to stay below the 2 degrees Celsius
threshold.]{.underline}**

### 1NC -- Generic

\[SA\]

**[Sceptics such as Plimer often complain that 'consensus' has no place
in science.]{.underline}** Strictly they are right, but I think it is a
red herring. I happily agree that you can have some degree of scientific
consensus about the past and the present. The earth is a sphere;
evolution is true; carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. **[The IPCC
claims in its most recent report that it is '95 per cent' sure that
'more than half' of the (gentle) warming 'since 1950' is
man-made.]{.underline}** I'll drink to that, though it's a pretty vague
claim. **[But you really cannot have much of a consensus about the
future]{.underline}**. Scientists are terrible at making forecasts --
indeed as Dan Gardner documents in his book Future Babble they are often
worse than laymen. And the climate is a chaotic system with multiple
influences of which human emissions are just one, which makes prediction
even harder.¶ **[The IPCC actually admits the possibility of lukewarming
within its consensus, because it gives a range of possible future
temperatures]{.underline}**: it thinks the world will be **[between
about 1.5 and 4.C]{.underline}** warmer on average by the end of the
century. That's a huge range, **[from marginally beneficial to
terrifyingly harmful, so it is hardly a consensus of
danger]{.underline}**, and if you look at the 'probability density
functions' of climate sensitivity, they always cluster towards the lower
end.¶ **[What is more, in the small print describing the assumptions of
the 'representative concentration pathways', it admits that the top of
the range will only be reached if sensitivity to carbon dioxide is high
(which is doubtful); if world population growth re-accelerates (which is
unlikely); if carbon dioxide absorption by the oceans slows down (which
is improbable); and if the world economy goes in a very odd direction,
giving up gas but increasing coal use tenfold (which is implausible).¶
But the commentators ignore all these caveats and babble on about
warming of 'up to' four degrees]{.underline}** (or even more), **[then
castigate as a 'denier' anybody who says]{.underline}**, as I do, **[the
lower end of the scale looks much more likely given the actual
data.]{.underline}** This is a deliberate tactic. Following what the
psychologist Philip Tetlock called the 'psychology of taboo', **[there
has been a systematic and thorough campaign to rule out the middle
ground as heretical]{.underline}**: not just wrong, but mistaken,
immoral and beyond the pale. That's what the word 'denier', with its
deliberate connotations of Holocaust denial, is intended to do. For
reasons I do not fully understand, journalists have been shamefully
happy to go along with this fundamentally religious project.¶
Politicians love this polarising because it means they can attack a
straw man. It's what they are good at. 'Doubt has been eliminated,' said
Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Prime Minister of Norway and UN Special
Representative on Climate Change, in a speech in 2007: 'It is
irresponsible, reckless and deeply immoral to question the seriousness
of the situation. The time for diagnosis is over. Now it is time to
act.' John Kerry says we have no time for a meeting of the flat-earth
society. Barack Obama says that 97 per cent of scientists agree that
climate change is 'real, man-made and dangerous'. That's just a lie (or
a very ignorant remark): as I point out above, there is no consensus
that it's dangerous.¶ So where's the outrage from scientists at this
presidential distortion? It's worse than that, actually. **[The 97 per
cent figure is derived from two pieces of pseudoscience]{.underline}**
that would have embarrassed a homeopath. **[The first was a poll that
found that 97 per cent of just seventy-nine scientists thought climate
change was man-made -- not that it was dangerous. A more recent poll of
1854 members of the American Meteorological Society found the true
number is 52 per cent.]{.underline}** ¶ **[The second source of the 97
per cent number was a survey of scientific papers, which has now been
comprehensively demolished by Professor Richard Tol]{.underline}** of
Sussex University, **[who is probably the world's leading climate
economist]{.underline}**. As the Australian blogger Joanne Nova
summarised Tol's findings, **[John Cook of the University of Queensland
and his team used an unrepresentative sample, left out much useful data,
used biased observers who disagreed with the authors of the papers they
were classifying nearly two-thirds of the time, and collected and
analysed the data in such a way as to allow the authors to adjust their
preliminary conclusions as they went along,]{.underline}** a scientific
no-no if ever there was one. **[The data could not be replicated, and
Cook himself threatened legal action to hide them.]{.underline}** Yet
neither the journal nor the university where Cook works has retracted
the paper, and the scientific establishment refuses to stop citing it,
let alone blow the whistle on it. Its conclusion is too useful. ¶
**[This should be a huge scandal]{.underline}**, not fodder for a tweet
by the leader of the free world. Joanne Nova, incidentally, is an
example of a new breed of science critic that the climate debate has
spawned. With little backing, and facing ostracism for her heresy, this
talented science journalist had abandoned any chance of a normal,
lucrative career and systematically set out to expose the way the huge
financial gravy train that is climate science has distorted the methods
of science. In her chapter in The Facts, Nova points out that **[the
entire trillion-dollar industry of climate change policy rests on a
single hypothetical assumption, first advanced in 1896, for which to
this day there is no evidence. ¶ The assumption is that modest warming
from carbon dioxide must be trebly amplified by extra water
vapour]{.underline}** -- **[that as the air warms there will be an
increase in absolute humidity providing 'a positive feedback'. That
assumption led to specific predictions that could be tested. And the
tests come back negative again and again. The large positive feedback
that can turn a mild warming into a dangerous one just is not there.
There is no tropical troposphere hot-spot. Ice cores unambiguously show
that temperature can fall while carbon dioxide stays high. Estimates of
climate sensitivity, which should be high if positive feedbacks are
strong, are instead getting lower and lower. Above all, the temperature
has failed to rise as predicted by the models.]{.underline}**

growth, and **[the Chinese add a]{.underline}** 500-megawatt

equipment actually use it. **[Some say if America just sets the example,
everybody else will follow. But a real pollutant, sulfur dioxide, is a
fine indicator of how good-example strategy doesn't work at all. America
has been scrubbing sulfur dioxide out of smokestacks for more than 20
years because it's a real pollutant, but China still
refuses]{.underline}**.

#### No impact to warming

Jerusalem Institute for Market Studies, "There is always time for
rational skepticism: Reply to Hall et al," April 2015, ScienceDirect)

The uncertainty that encompasses current climate change assessments is
strengthened in light of the studies indicating that [over earth\'s
history there have been **distinct warm periods** with temperatures
**exceeding the current ones**]{.underline} (Esper et al., 2012,
McIntyre and McKittrick, 2003 and Soon and Baliunas, 2003). [Reviewing
the relevant scientific literature, Khandekar, Murty, and Chittibabu
(2005]{.underline}) [concluded that "in the context of the earth\'s
climate through the last 500 million years, the recent]{.underline}
(1975--2000) [increase in the earth\'s mean temperature does not appear
to be **unusual** or **unprecedented**]{.underline} [as claimed by IPCC
and many supporters of the global warming hypothesis]{.underline}" (p.
1568). Other studies challenged the mainstream climate change narrative,
according to which CO2 levels in the earth\'s atmosphere play a
prominent role in rising temperatures. One notable example is the
research by Shaviv and Veizer (2003), which demonstrates that the
earth\'s temperature correlates well with variations in cosmic ray flux,
rather than changes in atmospheric CO2. These findings and others stir
contentious debates within the climate scientific community, but are
nevertheless largely overlooked by the IPCC, which ignores alternative
explanations for climate change. Regrettably, Hall et al. scornfully
dismiss this evidence, presented in our research note, based on
cherry-picking of a few "non-peer-reviewed" references that were cited,
some vague claims about "misreading" and "selective citing," as well as
other semantic nitpicking. 4. Impacts of climate change [The IPCC warns
that climate change is likely to have severe consequences, particularly
for poor countries, such as increased hunger, water shortages,
vulnerability to extreme weather events and debilitating diseases.
**However**, these estimations have been **heavily criticized** for
failing to properly account for **substantial improvements in adaptive
capacity**]{.underline} (i.e., the capability of coping with the impact
of global warming) [that are likely to occur due to advances in
**economic development**, **technological change** and **human capital**
over the next century]{.underline} (Goklany, 2007). [Fostering economic
growth and technological development, largely achievable through the use
of fossil fuels]{.underline}, [will strengthen both industrialized and
developing countries\' **adaptive capacity** to deal not just with
possible future climate change consequences, but also with other
environmental and public health problems]{.underline}. [Such policy will
**provide greater benefits** at lower costs than drastic climate change
mitigation efforts involving substantially cutting greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline} (Goklany, 2004 and Goklany, 2012). Furthermore,
the analyses of Galiana and Green (2009) exemplify that in the current
state of energy technologies, the suggested plans for ambitious emission
reductions will likely severely clobber the global economy, especially
in view of present economic conditions. In order to stabilize
atmospheric CO2 at accepted levels, there is a need for enormous
advances in efficient energy technology, which is currently missing
(Pielke, Wigley & Green, 2008). In any case, [**even if** every
industrialized nation meets the most ambitious emissions targets set by
the Kyoto Protocol]{.underline}, [such efforts are likely to have
**little effect**]{.underline}, [particularly in the light of the
considerable increases in greenhouse gas emissions by rising economic
superpowers as **China** and **India**, as well as the **remaining
developing world**]{.underline} (Wigley, 1998). Hall et al. criticized
us for choosing "selective citations...that discuss natural processes
potentially affect climate in specific locations and times." Yet the
purpose of referring to such studies was to refute the claims made by
the IPCC and other climate change alarmists to the effect that recent
extreme weather events (e.g., floods, droughts and storms) are the
consequences of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Moreover,
data shows that despite claims that the number and intensity of extreme
weather has increased, between 1900 and 2010 the average annual death
and death rates from extreme weather events has declined by 93% and 98%,
respectively (Goklany, 2009). This is mostly due to economic and
technological factors, such as improved global food production, increase
globalized food trade and better disaster preparedness. IPCC\'s
exaggerated estimations of climate change impacts were also noted in an
op-ed in Financial Times written by climate economist Richard Tol
(2014), a week following his demand that his name as one of the leading
authors be removed from the IPCC\'s AR5 due to its over alarmist
assessments of the impacts of AGW and underestimation of humanity\'s
adaptive capacity. As concluded by Tol, "[Humans are a **tough** and
**adaptable** species]{.underline}. People live on the equator and in
the Arctic, in the desert and in the rainforest. [**We survived ice
ages** with]{.underline} **[primitive technologies]{.underline}**. [The
idea that climate change poses an existential threat to humankind
is]{.underline} **[laughable]{.underline}**" (2014, para 1).

### 1NC -- US Not Key

#### US not key -- Paris proves -- we left and it only got better -- holds other countries accountable

**Meyer 17** (Robinson; Current writer and correspondent at the
Atlantic, with a Bachelor's degree from Northwestern University; "Will
the Paris Agreement Be Stronger Without the United States?";

published 5/30/17; accessed 8/11/17) \[TG\]

**[The Paris Agreement on climate change works by a delicate bit of
magic]{.underline}**. **[The treaty aims to reduce the world's
greenhouse-gas emissions]{.underline}**, **[but it legally requires no
one to actually stop emitting greenhouse gases]{.underline}**. Instead,
**[it advances a set of loose and voluntary norms for getting to the
final goal]{.underline}**. **[In 2015, every country announced a
(nonbinding) plan in which they promised to (eventually) slow down
pumping carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. In 2018, and
every five years afterward, all the countries will get together again
and announce new promises. This looseness was
intentional]{.underline}**. The accord's architects hoped to nudge
everyone into bringing down their emissions together---but they didn't
(and couldn't) force any one nation to do it. **[More pointedly, they
also could not compel a Republican-controlled U.S. Senate to ratify any
binding international climate treaty. So Paris trades in signals, not
sacrifice; unanimous resolutions, not top-down restrictions. John Kerry
said during negotiations that it sends "literally a critical message to
the global marketplace." In truth, this is pretty much the only thing it
does.]{.underline}** **[The Paris deal worked as long as Barack Obama
was president]{.underline}**, and **[it would probably have worked under
a President Hillary Clinton, too.]{.underline}** Some senior U.S.
official would attend the meeting every year to clamor about the
document's importance, and investors would get the message and plunge
more money into renewable-energy infrastructure and research.
**[President Trump, however, has speculated about leaving the treaty
since its completion]{.underline}**. **[If he stays in the treaty, he
will do so only begrudgingly. That's why some climate leaders are now
wondering: Will the Paris agreement be stronger without the United
States---at least as long as its president doubts climate
change?]{.underline}** Luke Kemp, a political scientist at Australian
National University who has attended many climate negotiations, gets to
the point in pithy piece at The Conversation: "Money and emissions are
all that matter." (He made the same argument in a paper in Nature
Climate Change last week.) **[Neither money nor emissions will change if
the United States is actually a member of the Paris
treaty]{.underline}**, he says. The accords don't require the U.S. to
commit money to the Green Climate Fund, **[a UN pool meant to help
developing countries prepare for the consequences of global warming.
Under Trump, it won't.]{.underline}** More importantly, **[the agreement
also won't change how much heat-trapping gas escapes from American smoke
stacks, tail pipes, or farm land. Trump has already begun to weaken many
of the domestic programs---]{.underline}**such as Obama's Clean Power
Plan for the electricity sector, and the greenhouse-gas CAFE standards
for cars---that would have added teeth to America's Paris goals. (Kemp
argues that, without them, the country will "probably miss its climate
target.") Kemp also worries about the cascading effects of having an
indolent United States in treaty meetings. If America misses its global
target---and nothing happens---will the momentum that sustains Paris
halter and fall apart? There remain many governing details of the treaty
that have yet to be finalized, too. Negotiators will spend time between
now and 2020 committing them to paper. If the U.S. stays in, Rex
Tillerson's State Department will retain a veto power in these talks.
Will it weaken the treaty? Joseph Curtin, one of Ireland's leading
climate-policy wonks and a member of its official climate advisory
council, also believes the United States should exit the treaty. Paris,
he argues, is a "club for countries who are part of a global effort to
tackle dangerous climate change." The U.S. doesn't make that cut
anymore. As part of his pitch, he turns one of the most familiar
arguments for staying in Paris on its head: that oil and coal companies
like Exxon, Shell, and Peabody Energy support U.S. involvement in the
treaty. (Peabody, the largest U.S. coal company, has long lobbied
against any kind of climate policy, so its support for Paris is a
surprise.) If all these fossil-fuel companies care about global warming,
he asks, where were they when the Trump administration was weakening
every meaningful domestic climate policy? "The current debate is really
between those who want to leave Paris and totally deny climate change,
and those who see Paris as a branding and lobbying opportunity," he
says. Therefore, the U.S. should leave, so the American public can
understand the true stakes of the fight: Polling suggests that the vast
majority of Americans favor staying in. Should the U.S. leave, however,
the moral outrage of these constituents could be a powerful catalyst for
change. There is a danger remaining in could muddy the waters and allow
U.S. citizens to believe they are contributing to resolving a global
problem, when the opposite is the case. **[It's a novel argument for
leaving the treaty---and one that, to be clear, remains a minority view.
Almost every Congressional Democrat supports staying in Paris, as do
more than a dozen House or Senate Republicans. More than 60 major
companies---including Apple, Walmart, General Motors, 3M, Dupont, and
Dow Chemical---all want the Trump administration to
remain.]{.underline}** So do Rick Perry, Rex Tillerson, and Gary Cohn, a
White House economic adviser. In addition, high-profile environmental
groups across the political spectrum---including the Sierra Club,
350.org, and Catholic Climate Commitment---have all beseeched Trump to
stick in the agreement. Trump has promised he would deliver a final
verdict on Paris this week**[. If he decides to leave, then a future
president could still rejoin the treaty.]{.underline}** **[Meanwhile,
China, India, and the European Union have all said they will uphold
their commitments and stay in the treaty.]{.underline}** So it will be
left to them---and U.S. voters in the 2020 election---whether the
American exit from Paris dooms that agreement to the same fate as the
Kyoto Protocol, or whether it becomes merely a short hiatus from a
long-term global solidarity.

### 1NC -- AT: War

#### Warming doesn't cause war

**Kozacek 16** -- Circle of Blue (Cody, "Climate Change Effects On
Conflict Are Complex, Tenuous, And Misunderstood", 3/30/16,
http://www.circleofblue.org/2016/water-climate/stress-conflict-migration/climate-change-effects-conflict-complex-tenuous-misunderstood/)

**[Expert evaluation of climate change as a factor in initiating
conflict has, by no means, reached a consensus]{.underline}**. **[Global
security experts]{.underline}** say it is completely possible for
climate change to have indirect effects on conflict in the future, but
**[acknowledge that the relationships are extremely complex and can be
difficult to tease out on a country-by-country basis. These factors
include a country's governance, infrastructure, and levels of
corruption]{.underline}**, which can interact with environmental
pressures. **[For example, Africa's Sahel]{.underline}** region, the
Horn of Africa, **[and the Middle East are already relatively unstable
politically]{.underline}**. They are also expected to see hotter and
drier temperatures under future climate change scenarios. But **[because
the risk of conflict is already high due to poor governance issues,
climate change is unlikely to shift current military or humanitarian
strategies in these regions.]{.underline}** Instead, the long-term
effects of climate change could become more of a problem---in security
terms---in the emerging economies of Latin America and Asia. "**[The
bottom line is climate change can't be seen as an either necessary or
sufficient driver of conflict]{.underline}**," **[said]{.underline}**
Jeffrey **[Mazo]{.underline}**, **[consulting member of the
International Institute for Strategic Studies]{.underline}**, a
London-based research organization focusing on global relations and
security policy. "Nothing else is. **[There are a dozen other
factors]{.underline}**, and I think this is an area of consensus among
studies, that are drivers of conflict." "The most serious strategic
implications are in these more nebulous areas where climate change could
contribute to the destabilization of relatively stable areas," added
Mazo. The idea that climate change will undermine international security
has been circulating for at least the past decade. The thesis gained
traction in the public sphere in 2007 at the height of the conflict in
Darfur, a region of Sudan, and again last year in light of Syria's civil
war. The ignition points for both conflicts were linked to droughts.
Both also were seen by some climate scientists, economists and
diplomatic authorities as evidence that climate change could cause more
wars and conflicts in the future. "Sudan's tragedy is not just the
tragedy of one country in Africa, it is a window to a wider world
underlining how issues such as uncontrolled depletion of natural
resources like soils and forests allied to impacts like climate change
can destabilize communities, even entire nations," Achim Steiner, the
executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said in
a statement accompanying a 2007 report about the Darfur conflict.
Steiner's words, like those used in many of the reports and studies
warning of a link between climate and conflict, describe climate change
as a force capable of multiplying the threat from other risk
factors---such as poor governance or inadequate infrastructure. In many
cases, **[there is no quantifiable data available to prove or disprove a
definitive link between a climate event, like a drought, and climate
change, much less between a drought and human conflict]{.underline}**.
**[The relationships are so complex that they are more akin to a
butterfly effect than a falling set of dominoes]{.underline}**. But to
consider only the potential for a drought to create a war, even with
caveats and detours along the way, is to put the phenomena into an
equation where climate change is a purely environmental input and
violent conflict is the only outcome. Instead, climate change is shaking
up each facet of modern life---economic, political, and social. Major
international banks and investment institutions have withdrawn their
support for the coal sector in the past year as governments and climate
activists urge companies to divest from fossil fuels, and renewable
energy alternatives become cheaper. This month, Peabody Coal, the
world's largest private-sector coal company, indicated that it may file
for bankruptcy. In the political realm, development plans like India's
Himalayan hydropower scheme have been literally swept away by a
climate-related flood in 2013. Or, in the case of South Africa's pursuit
of coal-fired energy, rendered untenable by that nation's changing
hydrological cycles and steadily declining reserves of fresh water.
**[Severe droughts in Australia and California have sparked fundamental
shifts in the way farm products are produced, freshwater is transported,
and how residents view, value, conserve, and use water. Disturbances on
such a large scale possess an inherent tension. Whether they result in
violent conflict is impossible to know.]{.underline}** In fact,
**[scientific studies about conflict show that competition over scarce
resources like water is much more likely to be resolved through
cooperation than violence]{.underline}**. What is clear is that
**[climate change will force countries to reassess the way they govern
resources, the way they build infrastructure, and the way they fuel
their economies.]{.underline}** A Different Way To View Climate and
Conflict One of the greatest areas of uncertainty and stress will be the
global economy, according to Jan Selby of the Sussex Centre for Conflict
and Security Research. Instead of more severe droughts, floods, and sea
level rise driving destabilization, it is much more likely that the
economic implications of climate change and adaptation will cause
discord. Responses to climate change are already beginning to shake the
foundations of the planet's largest industrial sectors---energy
production, agriculture, and mining. Even in cases where arguments have
been made that drought contributes to conflict --- the Syrian civil war,
for example --- the subsequent social disruptions were primarily the
result of economic reverberations. In 2009, during the third consecutive
year of drought, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO) said that most farmers in Syria who depended on rain to
water their crops had suffered complete or near-total losses, while
livestock herders were only able to maintain 3 to 10 percent of their
animals. The report found that the income of severely affected groups
had dropped 90 percent since 2006. The farmers' ability to withstand the
drought had been largely eroded by larger economic policies pursued by
the Assad government. Between 2007 and 2008, prices for diesel in Syria
nearly tripled as the government cut back subsidies, according to the
Middle East Research and Information Project. This increased costs for
farmers, who use diesel fuel to power their irrigation pumps. The
government had also encouraged the expansion of wheat production and
other crops by promoting irrigation. As a result, groundwater reserves
in many agricultural areas were depleted as irrigated areas doubled
between 1984 and 2000. All of this added up to a significant migration
of families from drought-hit areas to cities in 2009, though the number
of migrants is disputed. "Droughts probably shouldn't be thought of as
environmental phenomena in this respect. They should be thought of as
economic phenomena, meaning phenomena that exacerbate economic problems
and especially people's adaptive and coping capacity," said Selby. "A
lot of the moving that took place needs to be understood in the context
that the Northeast was the poorest and most marginalized area of Syria,
where they had high levels of raw debt, where the Syrian government
didn't make any credit available to farmers and herders, and where, yes,
if a drought happens, people's earnings go down from farming and a lot
of livestock would have been sold or sent to slaughter early, so people
decimated their own stocks and the ability to replenish them. But the
economic context is a huge reason why drought has such an effect." Other
Factors Matter **[Destabilization or pressure on natural
resources]{.underline}**, however, **[does not always equal
conflict]{.underline}**. **[Regions with well-functioning and responsive
governments, like Australia and California, have shown great capacity to
resolve conflicts over water before they escalate to
violence]{.underline}**, even amid unprecedented droughts. Moreover,
**[the majority of scientific studies actually show that people are more
likely to cooperate in times of resource stress than fight, especially
when it comes to water]{.underline}**. **[These outcomes should not be
discounted when discussing the potential links between climate change
and conflict]{.underline}**, according to Elizabeth Hartmann, professor
emerita of development studies at Hampshire College in Massachusetts.
"**[To blame poor people or think that poor people are going to
immediately engage in violent conflict when resources are scarce,
it]{.underline}** kind of **[relies on]{.underline}**---and I don't
think people are being intentionally racist---but it relies on **[old
colonial narratives about inferior races and barbarism]{.underline}**,"
said Hartmann. "**[Especially in the case of Africa]{.underline}**,
where a lot of this discourse is focused, it really bolsters the view of
poor Africans as savages and barbarians. I'm not saying people are
intentionally doing this, but **[they are not interrogating their own
stereotypes of people and where they come from
historically]{.underline}**."

OVERVIEW **[The Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has
most likely been destabilized]{.underline}** **[and ice retreat is
unstoppable]{.underline}** for the current conditions. **[No further
acceleration in climate change is necessary]{.underline}** **[to trigger
the collapse of the rest of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet on decadal time
scales]{.underline}**. **[Antarctica has the potential to contribute
more than a metre of sea-level rise]{.underline}** by 2100. A large
fraction of West Antarctic basin ice could be gone within two centuries,
causing a 3--5 metre sea level rise. **[Mechanisms similar to those
causing deglaciation in West Antarctica are now also found in East
Antarctica]{.underline}**. **[Partial deglaciation of the East Antarctic
ice sheet is likely for the current level of atmospheric carbon
dioxide]{.underline}**, contributing to 10 metres of more of sea level
rise in the longer run, and 5 metres in the first 200 years.
INTRODUCTION **[The West Antarctic Ice Sheet]{.underline}** (WAIS),
**[comprising more than two million cubic kilometres of ice, is under
pressure from a warming climate, with scientists saying its
break-up]{.underline}** ---- **[and an eventual global sea-level rise of
3--5 metres ---- is not matter of if, but when]{.underline}**. The West
Antarctic Peninsula is now the strongest-warming region on the planet,
and WAIS glaciers are discharging ice at an accelerating rate (Rignot,
Velicogna at al (2011) "Acceleration of the contribution of the
Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to sea level rise", GRL 38: L05503-7;
Mouginot, Rignot and Scheuchl (2014) "Sustained increase in ice
discharge from the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica, from 1973 to
2013", GRL 41:1576-1584). Recent studies, surveyed in this report,
suggest that **[WAIS passed a tipping point for large-scale deglaciation
decades ago]{.underline}**. **[This should not be surprising, because
such an event was foreseen almost 50 years ago]{.underline}**. In 1968,
pioneer glacier researcher John Mercer predicted that the collapse of
ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula could herald the loss of the
ice sheet. Ten years later, Mercer contended that \"a major disaster ---
a rapid deglaciation of West Antarctica --- may be in progress ...
within about 50 years" ("West Antarctic ice sheet and CO2 greenhouse
effect: a threat of disaster", Nature 271:321-325). He said that warming
"above a critical level would remove all ice shelves, and consequently
all ice grounded below sea level, resulting in the deglaciation of most
of West Antarctica". Such disintegration, once under way, would
"probably be rapid, perhaps catastrophically so", with most of the ice
sheet lost in a century. Credited with coining the phrase "the
greenhouse effect" in the early 1960s, Mercer's Antarctic prognosis was
widely ignored and disparaged at the time. Now in seems uncannily
prescient. Climate author Fred Pearce (in his 2007 book "With Speed and
Violence") quotes the leading cryosphere scientist Richard Alley as
saying a decade ago that there is "a possibility that the West Antarctic
ice sheet could collapse and raise sea levels by 6 yards \[5.5 metres\]"
this century. Pearce also interviewed NASA glaciologist Eric Rignot who
has studied the Pine Island glacier in West Antarctica for decades, and
concluded that "the glacier is primed for runaway destruction". Although
the much larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) --- with potential for a
50-metre sea-level rise if all ice were lost --- has generally been
considered more stable than WAIS, recent evidence suggests some outlet
glaciers there are displaying similar dynamics to those on West
Antarctica. GEOGRAPHY An ice shelf is a floating sheet, or platform, of
ice that is largely submerged and, up to two kilometres in height, that
abuts a land-based glacier, and extends into the ocean. The "grounding
line" marks the boundary between grounded ice (glacier) and the floating
ice shelf. Generally, an ice shelf will lose volume by calving icebergs
from the seaward-facing edge, but it can also be subject to rapid
disintegration events, in which cracking can dislodge very large
sections of ice. The formation of a huge crack --- 100 kms long, half a
kilometre wide and a hundred metes deep --- in the Larsen C ice shelf is
one recent example. Warming Antarctic waters are melting and thinning
the underside of ice shelves, making them more susceptible to
disintegration. Ice shelves act as a "plug" that buttresses and slow the
rate at which glaciers drain into the ocean, so the loss or diminution
of the ice shelf will accelerate the pace of glacier movement and hence
the rate of ice mass loss. Because much of WAIS sits on bedrock that is
below sea level (buttressed on two sides by mountains, and held in place
on the other two sides by the Ronne and Ross ice shelves), melting of
the submerged ice shelf allows warm ocean waters to proceed inland under
the ice sheet. This creates hidden valleys of melting ice, puts pressure
on the surface above, and contributes to large-scale rifting (cracking).
This process also results in the grounding line being pushed further
inland, in effect transforming the lower reaches of the glacier into an
ice shelf. Over the past 40 years, glaciers flowing into the Amundsen
Sea sector of WAIS (including Pine Island, Thwaites, Smith and Kohler
glaciers) have thinned at an accelerating rate, and observations and
several numerical models suggest that unstable and irreversible retreat
of the grounding line is under way. Whilst it is traditionally
considered that WAIS deglaciation would take a thousand years or more,
some experts have suggested in could occur in a period as short as a
couple of centuries because the rate of change in atmospheric greenhouse
gases and in the global temperature are unprecedented. RECENT RESEARCH:
WEST ANTARCTICA Rignot, Mouginot et al (2014) "Widespread, rapid
grounding line retreat of Pine Island, Thwaites, Smith, and Kohler
glaciers, West Antarctica, from 1992 to 2011", Geophys. Res. Lett.
41:3502--3509 **[The researchers found that the "tipping point" has
already passed for one of these "long-term" events]{.underline}**. In
the "Guardian" on 18 May 2014, **[lead researcher Dr Eric Rignot
explained]{.underline}**: "**[We announced that we had collected enough
observations to conclude that the retreat of ice in the Amundsen sea
sector of West Antarctica was unstoppable]{.underline}**, with major
consequences -- it will mean that sea levels will rise one metre
worldwide. What\'s more, its disappearance will likely trigger the
collapse of the rest of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which comes with a
sea level rise of between three and five metres. Such an event will
displace millions of people worldwide" (emphasis added). This study,
authored by some the world's best cryosphere scientists, stunned the
research community. Malte Meinshausen, an IPCC lead author who also
developed the RCP scenarios, said this research is "a game changer, this
is just one surprise with global warming of only 0.8 degrees of
warming\", and a "tipping point that none of us thought would pass so
quickly", showing we are "committed already to a change in coastlines
that is unprecedented for us humans" (https://vimeo.com/97926131). One
of the authors of this paper was asked what conditions would be
necessary to stop the loss of most of WAIS. The answer was that
restoring the temperature of the 1970s might do it. On the fate of West
Antartica, Rignot says "at the current rate, a large fraction of the
(WAIS) basin will be gone in 200 years, but recent modelling studies
indicate that the retreat rate will increase in the future... but it
could be within a couple of centuries" (emphasis added). **[Another
paper]{.underline}** (Joughin, Smith and Medley (2014) "Marine Ice Sheet
Collapse Potentially Underway for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West
Antarctica", Science, 344:735--738) **[uses models which the "indicate
that early-stage collapse has begun]{.underline}**" of the Thwaites
Glacier, **[and that no further acceleration of climate change and only
modest extrapolations of the current increasing mass loss rate are
necessary for the system eventually to collapse]{.underline}**. "**[The
next stable state for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet might be no ice sheet
at all]{.underline}**," says the paper's lead author, glaciologist Ian
Joughin. Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Centre and John
Abraham of the University of St Paul explain: "For decades, it has been
suspected that this region is particularly susceptible to rapid ice
loss, through a 'runaway retreat'. The cause of the retreat is known to
be increased frequency of warm ocean water intrusions onto the
continental shelf, which appears to be a consequence of increased
westerly circumpolar winds over the Southern Ocean. Models suggest that
increased winds are a result of increased greenhouse gas forcing in the
Earth system, and ozone loss effects on stratospheric/tropospheric
circulation" ("Briefing: Antarctic ice sheet mass loss and future
sea-level rise", Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers,
2014). Feldman and Levermann (2015) "Collapse of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet after local destabilization of the Amundsen Basin", PNAS
112;14191-14196 This modelling study of the Amundsen Basin finds that "a
local destabilization causes a complete disintegration of the marine ice
in West Antarctica... the region disequilibrates after 60 years of
currently observed melt rates" (emphasis added). \[The melt rates are
observed to be continuing to accelerate, so the actual time line will be
a good deal shorter.\] The significance of the study is given as: "The
Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass at an accelerating rate, and playing
a more important role in terms of global sea-level rise. The Amundsen
Sea sector of West Antarctica has most likely been destabilized.
Although previous numerical modeling studies examined the short-term
future evolution of this region, here we take the next step and simulate
the long-term evolution of the whole West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Our
results show that if the Amundsen Sea sector is destabilized, then the
entire marine ice sheet will discharge into the ocean, causing a global
sea-level rise of about 3 metres. We thus might be witnessing the
beginning of a period of self-sustained ice discharge from West
Antarctica that requires long-term global adaptation of coastal
protection" (emphasis added). Hansen, Sato et al (2015) "Ice melt, sea
level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate
modeling, and modern observations that 2°C global warming could be
dangerous", Atmos. Chem. Phys. 16:3761-3812 This research surveys
evidence from the previous warm Eemian interglacial period around
120,000 years ago. At that time there were rapid fluctuations in sea
level, and the study identifies a mechanism in the Earth's climate
system not previously understood, which points to a much more rapid rise
in sea levels than currently anticipated. Increasing ocean
stratification occurs when cooler surface layers from melting ice sheets
trap warmer waters underneath, accelerating their impact on the melting
of ice shelves and outlet glaciers. This in turn increases ice sheet
mass loss, and generates more cool surface melt water in a positive
feedback. **[The consequences include the slowing or shutting down of
key ocean currents including the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation]{.underline}** (AMOC), **[which Hansen says would increase
temperature differentials between tropical and sub-polar waters, and
drive "super storms"]{.underline}** such that "All hell will break loose
in the North Atlantic and neighbouring lands". The projected cooling
pattern of waters around Antarctica and the north Atlantic waters from
the injection of fresh ice-melt water is already visible in the observed
data (see diagram below), and is already contributing to a circulation
decline of AMOC. Smith, Anderson et al (2016) "Sub-ice-shelf sediments
record history of twentieth-century retreat of Pine Island Glacier",
Nature, 23 November 2016, doi:10.1038/nature20136 This study finds that
the present thinning and retreat of Pine Island Glacier in West
Antarctica is part of a climatically forced trend that was triggered in
the 1940s when an ocean cavity formed beneath the ice shelf, and
followed a period of strong warming of West Antarctica, associated with
El Niño activity. The final ungrounding of the ice shelf from the
seafloor ridge occurred in 1970 (see diagram below). It is interesting
to compare this result with the view of researchers in the Rignot,
Mouginot et al 2014 paper cited above that restoration of climate
conditions of 1970s would be necessary to prevent widespread ice mass
loss from WAIS. RECENT RESEARCH: EAST ANTARCTICA DeConto and Pollard
(2016) "Contribution of Antarctica to past and future sea-level rise",
Nature 531:591--597 In this research, climate models that better link
atmospheric warming with the fracturing of buttressing ice shelves and
structural collapse of their ice cliffs are used, calibrated against
past warm-period climate events and sea-level estimates, and then
applied to future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. During the last
interglacial (warm) period 130,000 to 115,000 years ago, the global mean
sea level was 6--9.3 metres higher than it is today, at a time when
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were below 280 parts per
million (the pre-industrial level, and 30% less than today),and global
mean temperatures were only about 0--2 °C warmer. Under a high-emissions
scenario, their model shows that rapidly warming summer air temperatures
trigger extensive surface meltwater production and hydrofracturing of
ice shelves by the middle of this century, with Larcen C the first ice
shelf to be lost, and major thinning and retreat of Amundsen Sea outlet
glaciers at the same time. (Note: The fracturing of the Larsen C ice
shelf is a current reality!) They conclude that: "Antarctica has the
potential to contribute more than a metre of sea-level rise by 2100 and
more than 15 metres by 2500", doubling previous forecasts for total sea
level rise this century to two metres or more. This estimate of
Antarctica alone contributing "more than a metre of sea-level rise by
2100" is consistent with the work of Hansen, Sato et al (above).
Pollard, DeConto and Alley (2015) "Potential Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat
driven by hydrofracturing and ice cliff failure", Earth Planet. Sci.
Lett. 412:112--121. During the warmest part of the Pliocene (5.3 to 2.6
million years ago) atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were
comparable to today's (\~400 parts per million), temperatures were
1--2°C warmer than now, and some sea-level reconstructions are 10--30
metres higher. Because WAIS and Greenland can supply less than 10 metres
of sea level rise between them, this means there was substantial ice
mass loss from East Antartica. In this study, the authors model Pliocene
conditions in the Antarctic by taking the current (and Pliocene) level
of 400 parts per million carbon dioxide, and impose a 2°C ocean warming
to represent maximum mid-Pliocene ocean warmth. Their model also
incorporates mechanisms based on recent observations and analysis:
"floating ice shelves may be drastically reduced or removed completely
by increased oceanic melting, and by hydrofracturing due to surface melt
draining into crevasses. Ice at deep grounding lines may be weakened by
hydrofracturing and reduced buttressing, and may fail structurally if
stresses exceed the ice yield strength, producing rapid retreat." The
updated model "accelerates the expected collapse of the West Antarctic
Ice Sheet to decadal time scales (rather than century-to-millennial time
scales), and also causes retreat into major East Antarctic subglacial
basins, producing ∼17 metres global sea-level rise within a few thousand
years" and five metres in the first 200 years (emphasis added). \[In the
followup 2016 paper cited above, an updated model produces an 11.3-metre
contribution to global mean sea level rise, reflecting a reduction in
its sensitivity of about 6 metres relative to the formulation in this
paper of \~17 metres, but within the range of plausible sea-level
estimates.\] Phipps, Fogwill and Turney (2016) "Impacts of marine
instability across the East Antarctic Ice Sheet on Southern Ocean
dynamics", The Cryosphere, 10:2317--2328 This research concludes that
local melting from the Wilkes Basin in East Antarctica "could
potentially destabilise the wider Antarctic Ice Sheet" as meltwater
rapidly stratifies surface waters so, whilst the surface ocean cools,
the Southern Ocean warms by more than 1°C at depth. "The temperature
changes propagate westwards around the coast of the Antarctic continent
with increasing depth, representing a positive feedback mechanism that
has the potential to amplify melting around the continent... Thus,
destabilisation of large sectors of the EAIS could arise from warming
and melting in just one area." As well: "Our results suggest that
melting of one sector of the EAIS could result in accelerated warming
across other sectors, including the Weddell Sea sector of the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet" (emphasis added). **[This paper is also consistent
with Hansen, Sato et al in finding a process of water column
stratification and warmer sub-surface waters as a positive feedback
mechanism that has the potential to amplify melting]{.underline}**.
Mendel and Levermann (2014) "Ice plug prevents irreversible discharge
from East Antarctica", Nature Climate Change 4:451--455 Substantial
sectors of the EAIS, including Wilkes Basin, are underlain by extensive
marine-based subglacial basins. This study shows that the removal of an
ice plug (shelf) at the margin of the Wilkes Basin, that would cause
less than 80mm of global sea-level rise, would destabilize the regional
ice flow and leads to a self-sustained discharge of the entire basin and
a global sea-level rise of 3--4 metres. As with the DeConto and Pollard
papers above, this study also discusses the analogous situation of the
the mid-to late Pliocene when "massive ice discharge occurred from the
unstable margins of Adélie and Wilkes Land due to ice-stream surges that
were linked to rapid grounding-line retreat during a warming climate".
Lenaerts, Lhermitte et al (2016) "Meltwater produced by wind--albedo
interaction stored in an East Antarctic ice shelf", Nature Climate
Change 7:58-62 This study identifies a mechanism that triggers melting
deep in the Roi Baudouin ice shelf in East Antarctica. Strong winds
helped heat the air and cause white ice to melt out, exposing a layer of
dark ice beneath, which in turns absorbs more sunlight, further
expediting the melt. In these hotspots, surface glacial lakes form and
meltwater pours into moulins, that funnel surface meltwater into the
heart of the ice. As well, researchers found subterranean "englacial"
lakes in the ice sheet. In total, 55 lakes on or in the ice shelf were
identified. This means the ice shelf has many large pockets of weakness
throughout its structure, suggesting a greater potential vulnerability
to collapse through hydrofracturing, especially if lake formation
continues or increases. Fogwill, Turney et al (2017) "Antarctic ice
sheet discharge driven by atmosphere-ocean feedbacks at the Last Glacial
Termination", Scientific Reports 7, article 39979 Antarctic ice mass
loss during the end of the last ice age 14,600--12,700 yrs ago
contributed several metres to sea levels which from various sources rose
by tens of metres. At that time, changes in atmospheric-oceanic
circulation led to a stratification in the ocean with a cold layer at
the surface and a warm layer below. Under such conditions, ice sheets
melt more strongly than when the surrounding ocean is thoroughly mixed.
This is exactly what is presently happening around the Antarctic now.
Research team member Michael E. Weber says, \"The changes that are
currently taking place in a disturbing manner resemble those 14,700
years ago.\" A NUMBER of recent studies have focussed on the Totten
Glacier in East Antartica. Several lines of evidence suggest possible
collapse of Totten Glacier into interior basins during past warm
periods, most notably the Pliocene epoch, and the glacier is again
becoming vulnerable: Totten has the largest thinning rate in East
Antarctica, driven by enhanced melting of the ice shelf bottom, due to
ocean processes. An ice-shelf cavity below depths of 400 to 500 metres
could allow intrusions of warm water and an inland trough that connects
the main ice-shelf cavity to the ocean. If thinning trends continue, a
larger water body over the trough could potentially allow more warm
water into the cavity, which may, eventually, lead to destabilization of
the low-lying region between Totten Glacier and the similarly deep
glacier flowing into the Reynolds Trough \[Greenbaum, Blankenship et al
(2015) "Ocean access to a cavity beneath Totten Glacier in East
Antarctica", Nature GeoScience\]. Totten could become unstable if global
warming continues at the present pace. As warm seas wash the ice shelf,
the land-based mass of ice could begin to retreat, cross a critical
threshold in the present century and then withdraw 300 kilometres inland
\[Aitken, Roberts et al (2016) "Repeated large-scale retreat and advance
of Totten Glacier indicated by inland bed erosion", Nature
533:385--389\]. Totten is melting from below as warm ocean water flows
inward powerfully towards Totten glacier, causing the ice shelf to lose
between 63 and 80 billion tons of its mass to the ocean per year. Warm
water enters a cavity beneath the glacier through a newly discovered
deep water channel \[Rintoul, Silvan et al (2016) "Ocean heat drives
rapid basal melt of the Totten Ice Shelf", Science Advances
2:e1601610\]. CONCLUSION In late 2015, a chilling report by scientists
for the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative on "Thresholds and
closing windows: Risks of irreversible cryosphere climate change"
(http://iccinet.org/thresholds) warned that **[the Paris commitments
will not prevent the Earth "crossing into the zone of irreversible
thresholds" in polar and mountain glacier regions, and that crossing
these boundaries may "result in processes that cannot be halted unless
temperatures return to levels below pre-industrial"]{.underline}**
(emphasis added). **[The report says it is not well understood outside
the scientific community that cryosphere dynamics are slow to manifest
but once triggered "inevitably forces the Earth's climate system into a
new state]{.underline}**, **[one that most scientists believe has not
existed for 35--50 million years]{.underline}**" (emphasis added). Ian
Howat, associate professor of earth sciences at Ohio State University,
says: "**[It's generally accepted that it's no longer a question of
whether the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will melt]{.underline}**, **[it's a
question of when]{.underline}**. This kind of rifting (cracking)
behaviour provides another mechanism for rapid retreat of these
glaciers, adding to the probability that **[we may see significant
collapse of West Antarctica in our lifetimes]{.underline}**."
(https://www.siliconrepublic.com/innovation/antarctic-ice-sheet-global-warming)
The scientists I have communicated with take the view that Rignot,
Mouginot et al. is a credible paper and, together with the evidence
published since, it would be prudent to accept that WAIS has very likely
passed its tipping point for mass deglaciation, with big consequences
for global sea level rise (SLR). DeConto and Pollard project more than a
metre of SLR from Antarctica this century. This tallies with the Hanse,
Sato et al scenario, which is also consistent with the findings of
Phipps, Fogwill and Turney. **[The reality of multi-metre SLRs is not
if, but how soon. "The natural state of the Earth with present CO2
levels is one with sea levels about 70 feet (21 metres) higher than
now]{.underline}**" says Prof. Kenneth G. Miller
(http://news.rutgers.edu/news-releases/2012/03/global-sea-level-lik-20120316).
Other research scientists agree it is likely to be more than 20 metres
over the longer term

Risk: Diplomacy and Governance",

[The **most likely** levels of global warming are **very unlikely to
cause human extinction**]{.underline}.15 The [existential risks of
climate change]{.underline} instead [stem from tail risk]{.underline}
climate change -- [the **low probability** of extreme levels of
warming]{.underline} -- [and interaction with other sources of
risk]{.underline}. It is impossible to say with confidence at what point
global warming would become severe enough to pose an existential threat.
Research has suggested that [**warming of 11-12°C** would render most of
the planet uninhabitable]{.underline},16 and would completely devastate
agriculture.17 This would pose an extreme threat to human civilisation
as we know it.18 Warming of around 7°C or more could potentially produce
conflict and instability on such a scale that the indirect effects could
be an existential risk, although it is extremely uncertain how likely
such scenarios are.19 Moreover, [the timescales over which such changes
might happen could mean]{.underline} that **[humanity is able to
adapt]{.underline}** enough [to avoid extinction in **even very extreme
scenarios**]{.underline}.

The probability of these levels of warming depends on eventual
greenhouse gas concentrations. According to some experts, [unless strong
action is taken soon by major emitters]{.underline}, it is likely that
[we will pursue a medium-high emissions pathway]{.underline}.20 If we
do, the chance of extreme warming is highly uncertain but appears
non-negligible. Current concentrations of greenhouse gases are higher
than they have been for hundreds of thousands of years,21 which means
that there are significant unknown unknowns about how the climate system
will respond. Particularly concerning is the risk of positive feedback
loops, such as the release of vast amounts of methane from melting of
the arctic permafrost, which would cause rapid and disastrous warming.22
The economists Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman have used IPCC figures
(which do not include modelling of feedback loops such as those from
melting permafrost) to estimate that [if we continue to pursue a
medium-high emissions pathway]{.underline}, the [probability of eventual
warming of 6°C is around **10%**]{.underline},23 [and]{.underline} of
[10°C is]{.underline} around **[3%]{.underline}**.24 [These estimates
are]{.underline} of course **[highly uncertain]{.underline}**.

[It is **likely**]{.underline} that [the world will take action against
climate change once it begins to impose large costs]{.underline} on
human society, **[long before there is warming of 10°C]{.underline}**.
Unfortunately, there is significant inertia in the climate system: there
is a 25 to 50 year lag between CO2 emissions and eventual warming,25 and
it is expected that 40% of the peak concentration of CO2 will remain in
the atmosphere 1,000 years after the peak is reached.26 Consequently, it
is impossible to reduce temperatures quickly by reducing CO2 emissions.
If the world does start to face costly warming, the international
community will therefore face strong incentives to find other ways to
reduce global temperatures.

As already noted, **[the IPCC scenarios]{.underline}** themselves **[are
wildly alarmist]{.underline}**, not only on the basic science but also
**[on the]{.underline}** **[underlying]{.underline}** economic
**[assumptions]{.underline}**, which in turn drive the alarmist impacts.
**[The result]{.underline}** **[cannot withstand critical
analysis]{.underline}**. Economists Ian Castles and David Henderson, for
example, show the extent to which the analysis is driven by the desire
to reach predetermined outcomes.50 Other economists have similarly
wondered what purpose was served by pursuing such unrealistic scenarios.
It is hard to credit the defense put forward by Mike Hulme, one of the
creators of the scenarios, that the IPCC is not engaged in forecasting
the future but in creating "plausible" story lines of what might happen
under various scenarios.51 **[Each]{.underline}** **[scare
scenario]{.underline}** **[is based on linear projections
without]{.underline}** **[any reference to technological developments or
adaptation]{.underline}**. If, on a similar linear basis, our Victorian
ancestors in the UK, worried about rapid urbanization and population
growth in London, had made similar projections, they would have pointed
to the looming crisis arising from reliance on horse-drawn carriages and
omnibuses; they would have concluded that by the middle of the 20th
century, London would be knee-deep in horse manure, and all of the
southern counties would be required to grow the oats and hay to feed and
bed the required number of horses. Technology progressed and London
adapted. **[Why should the rest of humanity not be able to do
likewise]{.underline}** **[in the face of a trivial rise in temperature
over the course of more than a century]{.underline}**? **[The work on
physical impacts is]{.underline}** **[equally over the
top]{.underline}**. **[All the scenarios assume]{.underline}** **[only
negative impacts]{.underline}**, **[ignore the reality of]{.underline}**
**[adaptation]{.underline}**, **[and attribute any and all things bad to
global warming]{.underline}**. **[Assuming the GHG theory to be correct
means that its impact would be most evident at night and during the
winter]{.underline}** in reducing atmospheric heat loss to outer
space.52 It would have greater impact in increasing minimum temperatures
than in increasing maximum temperatures. Secondary
**[studies]{.underline}**, however, generally **[ignore this
facet]{.underline}** of the hypothesis. **[The IPCC believes that a
warmer world will harm human health]{.underline}**
**[due]{.underline}**, for example, **[to increased disease,
malnutrition, heat-waves, floods, storms, and cardiovascular
incidents]{.underline}**. As already noted **[there is no basis for the
claim about severe-weather-related threats or
malnutrition]{.underline}**. The claim about heat-related deaths gained
a boost during the summer of 2003 because of the tragedy of some 15,000
alleged heat-related deaths in France as elderly people stayed behind in
city apartments without air conditioning while their children enjoyed
the heat at the sea shore during the August vacation. Epidemiological
studies of so-called \"excess\" deaths resulting from heat waves are
abused to get the desired results. Similar studies of the impact of cold
spells show that they are far more lethal than heat waves and that it is
much easier to adapt to heat than to cold.53 More fundamentally, this,
like most of the alarmist literature, ignores the basics of the AGW
hypothesis: the world will not see an exponential increase in summer,
daytime heat (and thus more heat waves), but a decrease in night-time
and winter cooling, particularly at higher latitudes and altitudes.
Based on the AGW hypothesis, Canada, China, Korea, Northern Europe,
Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, and Argentina will see
warmer winters and warmer nights. There are clear benefits to such a
development, even if there may also be problems, but the AGW industry
tends to ignore the positive aspects of their alarmist scenarios. The
feared **[spread of malaria]{.underline}**, a much repeated claim, **[is
largely unrelated to climate]{.underline}**. **[Malaria's worst recorded
outbreak]{.underline}** **[was in Siberia long before there was any
discussion of AGW]{.underline}**. Similarly, the building of the Rideau
Canal in Ottawa in the 1820s was severely hampered by outbreaks of
malaria due to the proximity of mosquito-infested wetlands in the area.
Malaria remains widespread in tropical countries today in part because
of the UN's lengthy embargo on the use of DDT, the legacy of an earlier
alarmist disaster. Temperature is but one factor, and a minor one at
that, in the multiple factors that affect the rise or decline in the
presence of disease-spreading mosquitoes. Wealthier western countries
have pursued public health strategies that have reduced the incidence of
the dis- ease in their countries. Entomologist Paul Reiter, widely
recognized as the leading specialist on malaria vectors and a
contributor to some of the early work of the IPCC, was aghast to learn
how his careful and systematic analysis of the potential impacts had
been twisted in ways that he could not endorse. In a recent paper, he
concludes: "Simplistic reasoning on the future prevalence of malaria is
ill-founded; malaria is not limited by climate in most temperate
regions, nor in the tropics, and in nearly all cases, 'new\' malaria at
high altitudes is well below the maximum altitudinal limits for
transmission. Future changes in climate may alter the prevalence and
incidence of the disease, but obsessive emphasis on 'global warming\' as
a dominant parameter is indefensible; the principal determinants are
linked to ecological and societal change, politics and economics."54
**[Catastrophic species loss]{.underline}** **[similarly
has]{.underline}** **[little foundation in past
experience]{.underline}**.55 **[Even if the GHG hypothesis were to be
correct]{.underline}**, **[its impact would be slow]{.underline}**,
**[providing significant scope and opportunity for
adaptation]{.underline}**, **[including by ﬂora and
fauna]{.underline}**. One of the more irresponsible claims was made by a
group of UK **[modelers]{.underline}** who **[fed wildly improbable
scenarios and data into their computers and produced the much-touted
claim of massive species loss]{.underline}** by the end of the century.
**[There are literally]{.underline}** **[thousands of
websites]{.underline}** **[devoted to spreading alarm about species
loss]{.underline}** and biodiversity. **[Global warming
is]{.underline}** **[but one of many claimed human threats to the
planet's biodiversity]{.underline}**. **[The claims,]{.underline}**
fortunately, **[are largely hype]{.underline}**, based on computer
models and the estimate by Harvard naturalist Edward O. Wilson that
27,000 to 100,000 species are lost annually - a figure he advanced
purely hypothetically but which has become one of the most persistent of
environmental urban myths. The fact is that **[scientists]{.underline}**
**[have no idea of the extent of the world\'s ﬂora and
fauna]{.underline}**, with estimates ranging from five million to 100
million species, and that **[there are no reliable data about the rate
of loss]{.underline}**. By some estimates, **[95 per cent of the species
that ever existed have been lost over the eons]{.underline}**, most
before humans became major players in altering their environment. A much
more credible estimate of recent species loss comes from a surprising
source, the UN Environmental Program. It reports that known **[species
loss is slowing reaching its lowest level in 500 years]{.underline}** in
the last three decades of the 20th century, with some 20 reported
extinctions despite increasing pressure on the biosphere from growing
human population and industrialization.57 The alarmist community has
also introduced the scientifically unknown concept of \"locally
extinct," often meaning little more than that **[a species of plant or
animal has responded to adverse conditions by moving to more hospitable
circumstances]{.underline}**, e.g., birds or butterflies becoming more
numerous north of their range and disappearing at its extreme southern
extent. Idso et al. conclude: "Many **[species have shown the ability
to]{.underline}** **[adapt rapidly to changes in climate]{.underline}**.
**[Claims that global warming threatens]{.underline}** large numbers of
species with **[extinction]{.underline}** **[typically rest
on]{.underline}** a false definition of extinction (the loss of a
particular population rather than en- tire species) and **[speculation
rather than real-world evidence]{.underline}**. **[The world's species
have proven]{.underline}** **[very resilient]{.underline}**, **[having
survived past natural climate cycles that involved much greater warming
and higher C02 concentrations than exist today or are likely to exist in
the coming centuries?"]{.underline}**

**[Even if the United States were to stop selling arms to
Taiwan]{.underline}** and renounce any security commitment to the
island, **[Taiwan would remain qualitatively different from areas under
direct PRC control. It would continue to be self-governing and
democratic, it would continue to maintain armed forces, and it
would]{.underline}**---for all intents and purposes---**[continue to
resemble an independent country]{.underline}** on all dimensions except
international legal recognition. **[But Taiwan's continued otherness in
this regard opens the door to possible US intervention in a cross-Strait
conflict even after a US decision to end its security commitment to
Taiwan. Leaders in Washington, for instance, might revise their view of
the PRC, especially in the aftermath of an attack on
Taiwan]{.underline}**, and particularly if renouncing the security
commitment entailed a quid pro quo PRC pledge. **[Thus, even after the
United States ended arms sales to Taiwan and renounced a security
commitment to the island, the probability of US intervention in a
cross-Strait conflict would not drop to zero]{.underline}**---in
contrast to the likelihood of US intervention in other areas of China
such as Tibet (or, for that matter, Hong Kong). But the more Taiwan
accommodated PRC demands by allowing itself to become something more
resembling Hong Kong or Tibet than an independent country, then the more
the probability of US intervention would begin to approach zero as it
does for other areas under direct PRC control. Such intervention would
increasingly, and unambiguously, represent intervention in a civil,
rather than an international, conflict.18

**[That the United States might simply give up on Taiwan]{.underline}**,
however, **[is one of the greatest myths of modern global
politics.]{.underline}**14 Reputation is often a major influence on a
state's decision to go to war.15 Washington's commitment to Taiwan is
becoming even more important as an indicator for the credibility of
America's 'rebalance' towards the Asia-Pacific. There is great
uncertainty among Asian allies of whether the coming US defence-budget
cuts will lead to at least a partial withdrawal of American troops from
the region. In particular, Japan anxiously watches for signals that the
United States might be 'abandoning' Taiwan.

**[Taiwan will not fall victim to some great bargain between China and

doctrine]{.underline}** to reassure its allies and partners about US
forces' continued ability and resolve to project military power even in
maritime zones contested by the PLA. **[Part of its response to China's

Taiwan]{.underline}** and visits to the White House by the Dalai Lama
**[were not reciprocated by Beijing]{.underline}** with friendly
gestures. **[Instead,]{.underline}** President Obama had a disappointing
state visit to China in November that year, and **[Beijing undermined
the Copenhagen climate change summit.]{.underline}**19 In the second
year of Obama's first term, he shifted to a different approach to Asia,
one that prioritized getting relations right with US allies and
partners, and embedding China policy within a larger Asia-wide
framework. That "outside-in" approach remained the mainstay of US policy
for the rest of Obama's presidency and underpinned the rebalance to
Asia. Faced with increasingly difficult challenges from China, US
presidents for years to come are unlikely to deviate from this approach.
Various combinations of engagement, binding, and balancing are likely to
be employed as the US attempts to shape China's choices and persuade it
to become a responsible stakeholder of the liberal Western international
order.

#### Incremental solutions solve best -- abandoning the fundamentals of the TRA is destabilizing

**Hickey** 20**13** -- Dennis V. Hickey is the James F. Morris endowed
professor of political science at Missouri State University ("U.S.
Policy Toward Taiwan: Time For Change?," *Asian Affairs: An American
Review*, Volume 40, Issue 4) bhb

American policy toward Taiwan is based upon a complex web of decades-old
doctrine, law, joint communiqués, assurances, barefaced threats and
secret promises. Decision-makers must take care to ensure that adherence
to selective policy mantras will not reduce America\'s ability to cope
with contemporary policy developments. But the problem with **[all
proposals to fundamentally change U.S. policy towards
Taiwan]{.underline}** is that they **[hold the potential to
unintentionally complicate matters.]{.underline}** If adopted, the
**[consequences might even prove catastrophic.]{.underline}**

**[Major policy shifts could jeopardize peace and stability in the
Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}** It is **[for this reason]{.underline}**
that **[the United States should not radically alter its present policy
toward Taiwan. However,]{.underline}** some **[modest
adjustments]{.underline}** in policy **[might be
warranted.]{.underline}** In fact, **[several of these proposals, if
adopted, would help reduce the prospects for conflict between Washington
and Beijing.]{.underline}** With respect to U.S. policy, the following
points seem paramount:

•**[The United States should not revise, revoke or repeal the
TRA.]{.underline}** The law provides American decision-makers with
much-needed flexibility in its economic, political and security
relations with Taiwan.

•The U.S. Congress should not pass new legislation mandating greater
legislative oversight of the TRA or pass legislation seeking to
"micromanage" relations between Washington and Taipei. The TRA provides
the U.S. Congress with sufficient ammunition to monitor developments
related to Taiwan.

•**[The United States should accelerate the campaign to help find ways
for Taiwan\'s voice to be heard as a "non-state" actor with "observer"
status in international organizations]{.underline}**---including those
that address climate change issues and aviation safety. Taiwan could
play a constructive role in such institutions, and **[it is unlikely
that these modest steps would provoke Beijing. On the other hand, the
United States should avoid "symbolic" gestures that serve to antagonize
Beijing (unnecessary cabinet level visits, etc)]{.underline}**.

•**[The United States should not junk the "one China"
policy.]{.underline}** Such a move would lead to a perilous
deterioration in Sino-American relations and undermine the present
position of the authorities in Taipei.

•The United States should not formally abrogate the U.S.-PRC Joint
Communiqués and resist PRC pressures to negotiate additional
communiqués. There are already enough documents purporting to guide U.S.
policy.

•**[The United States should not view arms sales to Taiwan as a
"stimulus plan" to provide a boost to the sagging American
economy.]{.underline}** This is one instance when national security
concerns must trump economic considerations.

•**[Using quiet diplomacy]{.underline}**, the PRC should be reminded
that President Reagan pledged that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan would be
"conditioned entirely on the threat posed by the PRC." **[Washington
should make clear that there is a linkage between U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan and China\'s military deployments]{.underline}**.

•**[The United States should continue to emphasize that it supports the
ongoing rapprochement between the Chinese mainland and
Taiwan]{.underline}**. A peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue will
promote peace and stability in the Western Pacific.

•**[Washington should continue to remind both sides that it opposes the
use of force to settle the Taiwan issue]{.underline}**, that a
resolution of the Taiwan issue is a matter for the two sides to decide
themselves **[and that the U.S. does not support independence for
Taiwan.]{.underline}**

The maintenance of a strong and constructive relationship with the PRC
serves American interests in many ways. As President Obama explained,
"we welcome China\'s rise. China\'s peaceful rise is good for the world
and it\'s good for America." 110 It opens the door greater international
stability and humanitarian progress. **[At the same time, the United
States maintains strong "unofficial" links with
Taiwan]{.underline}**---the first Chinese democracy in over 5,000
years---**[and strong commitments to the island.]{.underline}** Some
blast President Obama for "cozying up to Beijing with a wink and a nod."
But as Jeffrey Bader observed, such criticisms "are partisan rather than
security based." 111 A more balanced assessment reveals that the present
U.S. administration has sold more arms to Taiwan than its predecessor,
and that **[the]{.underline}** recent **[deal to upgrade the island\'s
warplanes "constitutes a real contribution to Taiwan\'s security and
underscores the U.S. commitment to Taiwan."]{.underline}** 112

What many critics of American policy fail to appreciate is that **[it is
in Washington\'s best interest to maintain a stable, constructive
relationship with both Taipei and Beijing]{.underline}**. Realizing this
objective is not an easy task---there may be numerous challenges in
coming years. However, **[the present U.S. policy has helped create an
environment enabling Taiwan and the Chinese mainland to peacefully
resolve their differences, and it is likely that the policy will
continue to contribute to peace and stability in future
years]{.underline}**.

#### "Salami tactics" temper Chinese retaliation and reassure allies

**Altman** 20**16** -- Dan Altman is a Postdoctoral Fellow with the
International Security Program in the John F. Kennedy School of
Government's Belfer Center at Harvard University. ("How to Sell Arms to
Taiwan," https://thediplomat.com/2016/11/how-to-sell-arms-to-taiwan/)
bhb

**[Imagine that]{.underline}** in 2020, **[China learns]{.underline}**
that **[the United States will soon deliver an unusually
large]{.underline}** and comprehensive **[arms package to
Taiwan]{.underline}**. Determined to continue growing its military
advantage -- **[and]{.underline}** therefore its leverage -- vis-à-vis
Taiwan, **[China declares a red line]{.underline}** against the
delivery, threatening severe consequences if the United States proceeds.
**[That]{.underline}** announcement **[ignites a standoff in the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}**. Each side mobilizes its forces and prepares for
the possibility of armed conflict.

This hypothetical scenario captures one of the most likely crises that
could break out between China and the United States in the coming years.
Because Sino-American relations may come to define the international
landscape of the 21st Century, it is essential to anticipate and, if
possible, avert exactly this sort of flare-up, which could divert that
critical relationship down the wrong path. Fortunately, **[this
particular danger is largely preventable through subtle changes in
policy that require no major sacrifices to the American national
interest]{.underline}**.

To avoid a future crisis with China over arms sales, **[the United
States should dispense with the "arms package" approach to arms sales to
Taiwan and instead conduct the sales in a steady stream of small
increments.]{.underline}** Nobel-prize winning strategist Thomas
Schelling coined the term "salami tactics" to describe this approach, a
reference to slicing off an objective in a series of gradual steps
rather than all at once. **[Using salami tactics does not mean selling
fewer arms. It means spreading out the same sales across a series of
transactions that are each individually too small to provoke a violent
Chinese response. This approach would have two core principles: no large
arms packages, no long lulls between arms sales]{.underline}**.

Adopting salami tactics would represent a marked change in U.S. policy.
In 1992, the George H. W. Bush Administration approved an arms package
that included 150 F-16A/B fighters, exactly the sort of unusually large
package that could one day trigger a crisis with an increasingly
powerful and assertive China. More recent arms packages have been
smaller, but still larger than necessary. In 2008, the United States
announced \$6.5 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, a package that included
Patriot missiles, Apache attack helicopters, and upgrades to the
Taiwanese Air Force's F-16s and F-5s. In protest, China suspended
military-to-military ties with the United States. In 2010, President
Obama approved another \$6 billion package featuring Patriot missiles,
Blackhawk helicopters, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and additional F-16
upgrades. China condemned the sales and sanctioned some participating
U.S companies. In 2014, the United States approved the sale of four
Perry-class frigates. It is currently common practice to announce up to
several years' worth of sales together.

Last December, the United States announced a \$1.83 billion arms package
for Taiwan that included two Perry-class frigates, amphibious assault
vehicles, anti-tank missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and upgrades to a
variety of other weapon systems. Predictably, China objected, with a
spokesman declaring, "We resolutely oppose sales of weaponry or military
technology to Taiwan by any country in any form or using any excuse."
China has yet to put its full power behind attempting to halt an arms
sale, but that may change as China begins to flex its newfound muscles.

The question is: why combine these sales into one larger package that is
so much more likely to provoke a stronger Chinese response? **[Adopting
salami tactics would]{.underline}** have **[mean]{.underline}**t
**[splitting up]{.underline}** the **[sales into multiple transactions
announced and delivered separately, bringing the price tag for each well
below \$1 billion]{.underline}**. There is simply no need to treat as
one package a set of unrelated weapon systems. Indeed, **[there is no
need to sell large numbers of the same weapon system all at
once]{.underline}**.

### Solvency -- Salami Tactics

#### Salami tactics solve escalation -- changing the process of arms sales depoliticizes

**Altman** 20**16** -- Dan Altman is a Postdoctoral Fellow with the
International Security Program in the John F. Kennedy School of
Government's Belfer Center at Harvard University. ("How to Sell Arms to
Taiwan," https://thediplomat.com/2016/11/how-to-sell-arms-to-taiwan/)
bhb

**[Salami tactics can help to avoid a crisis]{.underline}** in which
China learns of an impending arms deal and declares a red line against
it. **[China would find it difficult to threaten war over the
sale]{.underline}** of a few surface-to-air missiles or a single
frigate, especially **[after tolerating a similar delivery only months
beforehand]{.underline}**. How could such a large threat be credible for
such a small infraction? **[Rather than declare a red line it cannot
enforce over yet another modest and ordinary sale, China would more
likely opt not to set one at all]{.underline}**.

**[Just as important]{.underline}** as avoiding large arms packages
**[is avoiding long periods without any arms sales. A prolonged
suspension of arms sales]{.underline}**, even one that begins for
reasons other than assuaging China, **[will gradually solidify into a
precedent]{.underline}**. Once a no-sales precedent is in place, then
even a small sale after ten years of none will become more provocative
than it would be today. China might seriously consider accepting grave
risks to uphold a new status quo of zero arms sales to Taiwan.

Taiwan will sometimes need to quietly agree to larger multi-year deals
so that U.S. arms manufacturers know, for instance, to keep a particular
production line open. However, when this proves unavoidable, the United
States can still announce and deliver these sales in increments. Because
China would find it difficult to threaten to go to war in response to
rumors or media reports of private U.S.-Taiwan arrangements, China is
far more likely to make any red lines contingent on announcements or,
more likely, actual deliveries. In short, to adopt salami tactics would
mean choosing strategic benefits over administrative and commercial
inconveniences.

**[The key to the salami tactics approach is avoiding any single act
that so harms Chinese interests]{.underline}** -- as defined by Beijing
-- **[that China would seriously consider using or threatening force to
prevent it. Right now, U.S. policy draws too heavily on the arms package
approach and consequently risks just that.]{.underline}** Opportunities
to prevent serious crises without sacrificing the national interest do
not come along often. It is vital to take advantage of them.

### Solvency -- Salami Tactics -- AT Backlash

#### The combination of counterplan planks solves backlash -- reaffirming commitment to the One-China policy means that salami tactics will restore strategic ambiguity

**[The stated position would be that the United States would oppose
coerced unification]{.underline}** because it would hurt Taiwan's
democracy and hurt the mainland's political development by demonstrating
that coercion, rather than persuasion, rules the day. **[On the other
hand, Washington would refuse to fight for a Taiwan that declared
permanent legal independence from the Chinese nation]{.underline}**
because a Taiwan that holds out the possibility of eventual unification
under the right conditions is a force for democratization on the
mainland, a major national security goal of the United States. If
peaceful unification is at least possible, mainland political reformers
can use the nationalist mission of unification to promote their cause of
political liberalization. On the other hand, a Taiwan that would seek
independence would lead many mainlanders to associate democracy with
national break-up and weakness, pitting democracy and nationalism
against each other in PRC domestic politics. The speaker asserted that
this formula would likely be appealing in Congress (which is already
focused on Taiwan's democracy and the PRC's non-democracy), would
reassure Taiwan that the United States would intervene to prevent forced
reunification, and would reassure the mainland that the United States
had no intention of backing Taiwan independence with force. The speaker
believes that Beijing would find this policy reasoning annoying but
believable because it fits the CCP image of the United States as trying
to transform non-democratic polities around the world. The initial goals
of this strategy are not to spread democracy actively but to create a
lasting domestic consensus in the United States around the conditional
commitment to Taiwan's security implied by the ambiguity strategy, and
to convince all actors involved that we are committed to Taiwan's
security but that our commitment is conditional on Taiwan's behavior.

Several commentators agreed about the difficulties of balancing threats
and assurances, and one said that the notion of this "security dilemma"
must be brought back into our analysis. But there was widespread
criticism of the speaker's policy prescriptions ranging from doubts to
outright rejection. The reasons differed quite significantly and seemed
to cover the full spectrum of possible problems in the cross-Strait
relationship. Some believed that Beijing would find the formula
unacceptable and provocative because it would be using the Taiwan issue
to undermine the regime. Others argued that it would be unacceptable in
Taipei because it forecloses the option of independence. Still others
believed it is too controversial for U.S. domestic politics and would
lead to a backlash in Congress and elsewhere that would leave the United
States more unconditionally tied to Taiwan and more likely to come to
blows with the mainland.

One commentator stated that **[it remains unclear what the optimum level
of military deterrence is for the United States and Taiwan and how much
deterrence should be based on American military power and how much on
Taiwan's own]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[there are no clear boundaries
on what would constitute a provocation by Taiwan that would preclude
U.S. intervention.]{.underline}** The current referendum controversy
demonstrates this problem well. Others argued along the same line,
stating that the formula provided too much leeway for Taiwan to provoke
the mainland diplomatically short of a formal declaration of
independence. It would be easy for Taiwan to do this, one participant
pointed out, as people there already consider themselves independent of
the PRC.

The speaker responded to these critiques by pointing out that the
**[ambiguity]{.underline}** about what constitutes a Taiwan diplomatic
provocation or how the United States would respond militarily to a
mainland provocation **[already exists in U.S. strategy and would be
nothing new under the formula presented here. One advantage would be
that the mainland would be less likely to believe that Taiwan's gradual
diplomatic salami tactics would end in formal independence, and Beijing
might therefore be more tolerant of them than it is under the current
framework.]{.underline}**

Several commentators said that many elements of this strategy are
already in place but that it is a step back from current U.S. policy in
one key regard. **[The United States is now agnostic about the eventual
outcome in cross-Strait relations, but under this formula the United
States seems committed to reunification and appears to be closing off
the option of independence.]{.underline}** This is a problem because
Taiwan would not just oppose the formula but would successfully lobby in
Congress along these lines, undercutting the domestic legitimacy of such
a strategy in the United States.

#### Japan alliance is on the brink---perception of US abandonment guarantees prolif and East Asian war

**Monteiro 18** (2018, Nuno P. Monteiro is the Director of International
Security Studies and Associate Professor of Political Science at Yale
University, "Cascading Chaos in Nuclear Northeast Asia" The Washington
Quarterly, 41:1, 97-113)

[Since the end of the Cold War, Japan's security concerns focus on a
rising and revisionist **China and** on **North Korea**
provocations.]{.underline} When Pyongyang first tested a nuclear weapon
in 2006, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reaffirmed Japan's adherence to the
three nonnuclear principles, while President George W. Bush reasserted
the U.S. commitment to Japanese security.42 President Barack Obama
offered similar assurances after each subsequent North Korean nuclear
test.43 [Japan's nuclear forbearance is certainly made easier by
Japanese public opinion, which is frequently described as allergic to
nuclear weapons as a result of the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a
feeling that was only reinforced with the disaster at
Fukushima.]{.underline}44 [Nevertheless, **reliable U.S. security
assurances**, supported by the presence of a large number of U.S. troops
in Japan, have played a **key role** in maintaining Japan's **unique
forbearance against nuclear weapons**.]{.underline} After all, Japan is
the world's third largest economy and possesses full control of the
nuclear fuel cycle, yet remains a nonnuclear state. [Faced with a rising
and increasingly assertive China and with a rapidly growing North Korean
nuclear ability to target the Japanese islands, Tokyo more than ever
**relies on U.S. security guarantees** to be able to deter aggression
without its own autonomous nuclear arsenal. Should the Trump
administration **question U.S. commitments** to its East Asian allies,
Tokyo may be pushed to **change its policy of nuclear
forbearance**.]{.underline} As with South Korea, Washington might still
attempt to deter Japanese nuclearization by imposing economic sanctions
on Japan while denying it credible security guarantees. [In our view,
despite the deep level of international integration of the Japanese
economy and the strong preference of Japanese leaders to remain embedded
in the U.S.-led economic order, the dire security situation in which
Japan would be left in this scenario would likely lead Tokyo to push
toward nuclear acquisition despite any sanctions.]{.underline} The key
source of instability in this scenario, however, would stem from
Beijing's likely reaction to a Japanese proliferation effort. Given the
short breakout period Tokyo enjoys, Beijing's leadership would have to
decide fast on China's policy[. A preventive counterproliferation strike
against Japan would be exceedingly costly and, for now, likely to be
beyond the technical capability of the Chinese military, but a forceful
**Chinese** reaction, including threats of military action, is not
beyond the realm of the possible. This risk of Japanese nuclear
acquisition would, of course, **be compounded by eventual South Korean
nuclearization**. Were Seoul to build an autonomous nuclear arsenal,
Tokyo would be greatly tempted to do so as well.]{.underline} In what
concerns U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy, then, U.S. security
commitments to each of its two main East Asian allies are deeply
interconnected. [The removal of U.S. security guarantees to either South
Korea or Japan would trigger a process that would **vastly augment
instability in East Asia.**]{.underline}

**[I believe one of the issues for U.S. and Japan's cooperation is to
keep the stability of cross-strait.]{.underline}** However, President Xi

Taiwan. I wish to hear both of your position. And another question for
you, Senator. When are you reintroducing the Taipei Act? Thank you.\
SEN. GARDNER: Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Look, obviously -- Mike, I
don't know if you wanted to go first on that question. I'm sorry to jump
in.\
MR. GREEN: No, no.\
SEN. GARDNER: **[So the Asia Reassurance Initiative has significant
language dedicated to the U.S. relationship with Taiwan, from the Six
Assurances, restating our adherence to them; making sure that we
regularize arms sales, routinize arms sales to Taiwan; and making sure
that we have high-level visits to Taiwan from the United States. And we
will continue to pursue those commitments and
protections.]{.underline}**\
I think we've made that very clear to -- I had Ambassador Hsueh in my
office here a couple of weeks ago and made those provisions part of our
conversation. **[And our commitment to our relationship with Taiwan is
stronger than ever.\]{.underline}**
And as it -- as it relates to the TAIPEI Act, the TAIPEI Act is
legislation that we put forward that says the administration is
authorized to deny federal funding, deny aid to countries that back away
from their relationship with Taiwan. We introduced it last year as a
bipartisan bill. We will introduce that again soon in the new Congress.\
MR. HAYASHI: There's no such big debate or sexy discussions about Taiwan
in Tokyo nowadays. **[And, you know, trade relationship is very
nice.]{.underline}** And also, you know, betterment between the
China-Japan is not affecting so much politically in a negative way for
Taiwan-Japan trade relationship. **[So that there's not -- no such, you
know, change of the status or change of the way of thinking now in Tokyo
as regards to Taiwan.\]{.underline}**
MR. GREEN: **[I suspect in this room and other rooms around town we'll
be talking a lot more about this cross-straits issue, especially between
the U.S. and Japan.]{.underline}** President Tsai's new year's speech,
what she said about the Xi Jinping speech and the 1992 Consensus, if a
president of Taiwan had said that a few years ago there would have been
quite a backlash in town. **[But because of what Xi himself said about
unification being inevitable and so forth; and because of the growing
support for Taiwan, I think it's fair to say, in the Congress over the
last few years; and because of Prime Minister Abe's very close
relationship on a personal basis with many in Taipei --\]{.underline}**
MR. HAYASHI: His family.\
MR. GREEN: With not only his family. **[And I think this is -- this is
going to be a core issue, maybe the one that tests your strategy the
most --\
SEN. GARDNER: Well, you know, I would say just the growing support for
Taiwan in the United States Congress.]{.underline}** You know, we've
seen over the decades the strength of the U.S.-Israel relationship. And
I use this example because of the bipartisan nature of the support.
**[This is a bipartisan cause. It's a bipartisan effort. There is
bipartisan support for it. You see that same level of bipartisan support
for Taiwan, and I think that is an incredibly strong
message.]{.underline}**

#### That goes nuclear

**Tan 15** (2015, Andrew Tan is an Associate Professor at the University
of New South Wales. "Security and Conflict in East Asia", p. 31)

[East Asia's arms race leads to the classic problem of the security
dilemma, in which a state that is perceived as becoming too powerful
leads to counter-acquisitions by other states. This results in
**misperceptions**, **conflict spirals**, heightened tensions and
ultimately **open conflict**, thereby destroying the very security that
arms are supposed to guarantee]{.underline} (Jervis 1976). East Asia's
sustained economic rise since the end of the Korean War in 1953 and [the
lack of any major conflict since has lulled many into believing that
growing economic interdependence will make war unlikely in that
region]{.underline} (Khoo 2013: 47-48). However, **[this is a false
premise as significant historical antagonisms have
remained.]{.underline}** [Japan's imperialism prior to 1945 and its
failure adequately to account for its past continues to stir up strong
nationalist emotions in China and South Korea]{.underline}. In
additions, t**[he divisions between North Korea and South Korea are as
strong as intractable as ever, leading to an arms race on the Korean
peninsula]{.underline}**. [The situation is compounded by the weakness
or absence of regional institutions, regimes and laws that could
regulate interstate relations, build trust and confidence- and
security-building measures]{.underline} which were in pace in Europe
during the Cold War and helped to calm tensions as well as contain the
arms race exist in Asia. Within East Asia itself, [the Six-Party Talks
have focused only on the Korean issue and have not managed to stem North
Korea's open brinkmanship]{.underline} that in early 2013 almost brought
the Korean peninsula to war again. [The arms race in East Asia is
dangerous owing to the increased risk of **miscalculation as a result of
misperception**]{.underline}. Chinese policymakers appear to be
convinced that Japan is dominated by right-wing conservatives bent on
reviving militarism (Glosserman 2012). At the same time, [there is also
a perception within China that given its growing strength, it should now
aggressively assert what it perceives to be its legitimate claims in the
East and South China Seas]{.underline}. Thus, China's nationalist
discourse perceives that the problems about disputed territory emanate
from other powers, not China (Sutter 2012). [The consequences of
conflict between China and Japan, on the Korean peninsula or over
Taiwan, however, **will not stay regional**]{.underline}. As a key
player in East Asia[, the USA, which has security commitments to Japan
and South Korea, residual commitments to Taiwan, and troops on the
ground in East Asia and in the Western Pacific, **will be drawn in.**
The problem is that any conflict in East Asia is not likely to remain
conventional for long]{.underline}. In fact**[, it is likely that it
would rapidly escalate into a nuclear war]{.underline}** [because three
of the key players, namely China, North Korea and the USA, possess
**nuclear weapons.**]{.underline}

**[When discussing the opportunities and challenges of foreign policy in

determining factor in the peaceability of East Asia.]{.underline}** As
**[the world's fourth largest economy, it is too big a player to
ignore]{.underline}**. **[Despite its abdication of military power,
Japan retains---indeed exudes---the technological capacity to be a great
power. It lacks only the popular political will to assert hard
power]{.underline}**. Such apprehension is unique to Japan's distinct,
but increasingly distant, history. **[As China grows, Japan's abrogation
of force is not likely to hold. This is especially true as the US is
forced to confront the limits of its influence and power in East
Asia]{.underline}**. **[As US economic relations with China increasingly

Japan's Underlying Strength

Japan is a great power, but it shuns its full potential. In 2017, Japan
had a GDP of \$4.8 trillion making it the fourth largest economy in the
world (CIA, 2019). It is a hot bed of cutting-edge technological
development including civilian nuclear power (Holroyd, 2017). It has an
enduring culture with an established government and a demonstrated
ability to cope with manmade and natural disasters (Kissinger, 2015, p.
181). Yet, for all these advantages, **[Japan remains distinct among
great powers in that it voluntarily eschews military
force.]{.underline}**

The Japanese Self Defense Force (JSDF) are constrained by Article 9 of
the Japanese Constitution renouncing war and any formal military forces
(The Constitution of Japan, 1947). JSDF deployments are in concert with
UN or other peacekeeping operations with a notable exception being the
JSDF's participation in Iraqi Freedom (Watts, 2003). Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe continues to fight for changing the constitution. Doing so
would allow Japan to participate in collective self-defense with its
allies (The Economist, 2017).

**[As Japan's most important ally, the US supports Prime Minister Abe's
efforts to reinterpret the constitution]{.underline}** (Smith, 2014).
**[From the US perspective, Japan could operate more like Germany: a
strong economic ally with advanced military capacity that bolsters US
power in the region with minimal efforts by the US.]{.underline}**
**[Under the existing language of Article 9, Japan is likely to fall in
to the same category as Israel:]{.underline}** an ally with great latent
power that is unable to project or fully utilize that strength in its
home region. The US military becomes the primary guarantor of security
in such a region. In East Asia, this dynamic has benefited Japan by
allowing Tokyo to pursue vigorous economic development without the
historically concomitant martial build up. **[Never-the-less, the extent
of Japan's economic power, and it's latent---but underutilized military
capacity---means Japan meets three of Flemes' requirements for great
powers]{.underline}** (Flemes, 2007, p. 8).

Japan's Geopolitical Situation

Japan sits in a geographically precarious position. As an island nation
it must import nearly all the raw materials necessary for a modern
economy---a task whose difficulty has only increased as Japan's economy
advanced during the second half of the 20th century. This trade
requirement means Japan is fundamentally in need of a beneficial
relationship with a continental power. Russia, China, and South Korea
make the most logical sense. Russia has vast natural resources and would
likely leap at the chance for increased trade with a major
industrialized economy. Yet, Russia and the US are at odds over many
issues and Japan is unlikely to jeopardize its relationship with the US.
China is the world's second largest economy with vast natural resources
and South Korea is a fellow US ally. However, Japan has a long and often
fraught history with both states. Japanese war crimes during WWII are
only the most recent transgressions in relationships that go back
centuries. Such cultural dynamics create inherent tension that can
rapidly escalate minor events. The tit for tat response over contested
islands in the Senkaku's illustrates this point well.

How a Rising China Could Impact Japan

**[China's sheer size along with it's economic and (growing) military
clout in the region undermine Japan's position.]{.underline}** As a
trading partner, Japan has been displaced as the largest economy in the
region. Now, China is able to offer access to far larger domestic
markets as well as massive aid and infrastructure packages bilaterally
through the Belt and Road initiative as well as through multilateral
development banks (Stuenkel, 2015, pp. 127-8). **[Southeast Asian states
in particular are susceptible to Chinese bullying
tactics.]{.underline}** Japan has attempted to counter this through a
selective application of high-end development aid in the region (Kobara,
2018; Qi, 2018). Doing so provides a subtle alternative to China and
demonstrates Japan's practical value as a partner. This is especially
useful in Southeast Asia and with states like India and Australia. Each
have economic and geographic relationships with China they cannot avoid,
but do not want to be dependent on.

**[Yet China's rise cannot be papered over or ignored]{.underline}**.
**[Arguably the most important bilateral relationship in the world is
that between the US and China]{.underline}**. The scale of their trade
is immense, totalling over \$700 billion for imports and exports in 2017
(Observatory of Economic Complexity, 2018). **[In the coming decades,
the relative and literal value of that relationship will almost
certainly increase.]{.underline}** For the US this is a beneficial
outcome, **[but it will present Washington with hard choices that have
significant impact on regional security.]{.underline}** **[Japan and
other powers on the Chinese periphery (including the US) will be
increasingly pressured to acquiesce to Beijing's conception of order or
face economic costs.]{.underline}**

**[If the US prioritizes a strong economic relationship with China, the
US will have to acknowledge limits on its own power and the actions it
can take]{.underline}**. In general, **[US retrenchment does not
automatically mean that China will be the direct or sole
beneficiary]{.underline}**. However, because the US will have to
circumscribe its actions in a region where China is the dominant player,
at the expense of states who are caught between the reality of Chinese
power and history of US alliances, **[China will be best positioned to
benefit with the least amount of effort.]{.underline}**

**[Taiwan serves as a good example of this]{.underline}**. **[One of the
shibboleths of US policy in East Asia is that Taiwan must remain
free.]{.underline}** Since 1949 when Chaing Kai Shek and his Nationalist
Army fled the mainland for the island province, the US has guaranteed
Taiwan's nominal independence from China (Bush, 2019). B**[eijing has
never subscribed to this, yet has recognized the practical power
dynamics and been willing to make policy choices on a much longer
timeline than the US. Chinese influence in Taiwan will likely expand as
cross-strait trade grows]{.underline}**. Equally important, China's
military development over the last 30 years has had the dual effect of
challenging US dominance in the region and enabling more efficient cross
strait operations (DIA, 2019, pp. 7-11).

**[However, since the end of the Cold War, the symbolic power of a "free
China" vs. a "Red China" has waned in the popular US
perception]{.underline}**. Mainland China, while certainly not free, has
been destigmatized as US businesses came to rely on its vast labor pool,
natural resources, and now markets**[. Consequently, the idea that
Taiwan must unequivocally remain independent does not hold quite as
tightly as it used to]{.underline}** (Parameswaran, 2018**[). Added to
this is the fact that China does not need the US to reverse position on
Taiwan]{.underline}**. **[Merely preventing the US from hindering
China's dominance of Taiwan will suffice]{.underline}**. **[By
leveraging its economic relationship with the US, and creating a
face-saving political option, China could ultimately break the US
security guarantee to Taiwan]{.underline}**. **[Such a break would sound
alarms at the highest levels in Tokyo.]{.underline}**

Another similar, and likely more dangerous, possibility is China
breaking South Korea from the US orbit. South Korea exported over \$149
billion in goods to China in 2017, more than double its exports to the
US and six times those to Japan (OEC, 2018). Exports to China accounted
for roughly 25% of South Korea's total exports. Combined with the fact
that North Korea, South Korea's principle adversary, has only China as a
real ally, it is possible---evenly likely---that China will be able to
exert considerable influence over South Korea's decision making. More so
if there were to be a unified Korea since China would be compelled to
increase its involvement in the affairs of a unified Korea to ensure a
hostile power aligned with the US did not develop on its border.

Japan's Response

**[In both scenarios Japan would be faced with an existential challenge
that would fundamentally change its security calculus]{.underline}**.
**[The umbrella of a broad US security guarantee is what allows the JSDF
to focus on territorial defense, not expeditionary
warfare]{.underline}**. US **[nuclear weapons preclude any need for
Japan to develop its own nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. **[If that
security guarantee is called into question, then Japan would be required
to develop offensive capabilities up to and including nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}**

**[Taiwan is a danger because of its geographic position astride
shipping lanes to Southeast Asia]{.underline}**. **[This risks limiting
Japan's access to its Australian and Indian partners as well as
Southeast Asian states like Vietnam by virtue of sea
control]{.underline}**. Korea presents an age-old challenge in that a
unified Korea could be used as a launching point for an invasion of
Japan. Moreover, a unified Korea---or even just a South Korea more
aligned with China---would likely have less need for US forces stationed
on the peninsula. **[As it is, the Japan-US-South Korea security dynamic
hinges on the US. Without the moderating influence of the US, historic
grievances between Seoul and Tokyo are likely to manifest themselves and
drive further tensions]{.underline}**.

**[Most damningly, Japan will have seen at least one, if not more, US
allies and partners be sacrificed for the sake of US
interests]{.underline}**. **[Again, this is not to say the US would be
in alignment with China, or that it would abdicate its position in East
Asia entirely. However, perception is key.]{.underline}** **[The
perception that the US is not willing to honor its promises would
undermine the trust that holds the US led system
together]{.underline}**. Without the US Navy to ensure open access to
continental markets, **[Japan would be compelled to seek closer
relations with India, Australia, and possibly Russia as well as build
the capacity to self-ensure that access]{.underline}**. **[Japan is
already trying to expand its naval ship building capacity to sell
submarines to Australia]{.underline}** (Gady, 2018). **[Similarly, Japan
and India have steadily increased their defense collaboration on dual
use technologies]{.underline}** (Economic Times, 2018). **[Neither of
these facts is alarming in their own right, but they lay the groundwork
on which future arms agreements and defense cooperation can be
built.]{.underline}**

**[This build up would be perceived by its neighbors as unduly
aggressive, prompting similar responses by the Chinese, Korean, and even
Southeast Asian governments.]{.underline}** **[An insecurity spiral in
line with Mearsheimer's conception of state fear would
develop]{.underline}** (Mearsheimer, 2004, p. 187**[). Tensions would
force the US to either back Japan and alienate other powers in the
region, or push back on Japan weakening the alliance still further until
it ultimately came to a breaking point.]{.underline}**

Conclusion

In this scenario, **[China's rise appears to push the region into
conflict yet again]{.underline}**. **[However, this is not an
inevitability. The US still retains considerable hard and soft power in
the region.]{.underline}** Similarly, Japan has done well with its
targeted approach to aid and development. No state in the region would
benefit from a great power war in East Asia. Therefore, it is possible
to avoid the insecurity spiral through an active and consistent
diplomatic effort.

One aspect of that diplomacy is Japan's continued effort to develop good
relations with continental powers. Expanding trade with Southeast Asian
states along the lines of its 150 projects initiatives is a smart way to
maximize Japan's expertise and resources while countering China's
efforts. The US can and should support this effort either directly or by
encouraging allies like Australia, South Korea, and India to coordinate
their own efforts to maximize their collective efficiency. This helps
build support for both Japan and the broader US order as a source of
concrete benefit to states that are most susceptible to China's economic
bullying. Crucially, it also serves as a relatively benign reminder to
all parties that the US is invested in the economic and security
situation in East and Southeast Asia for the long term.

In that same vein, **[the US needs to work to reassure traditional
allies like Japan and South Korea---and competitors like China and
Russia---that it's security guarantees stand as written]{.underline}**.
However, that reaffirmation should also come with explicit expectations
for American allies**[. Neither Japan nor South Korea should be allowed
to unduly provoke another state in the region]{.underline}**. Should
they do so against the wishes of the US, those security guarantees would
be void. To prevent the appearance that these caveats are intended to
help the US avoid honoring its agreements, they should be used sparingly
and on critical issues like how to respond in the event of a clash with
China as it builds manmade islands in the South China Sea. By limiting
the number of exceptions, the US would send a clear message that it will
remain a force in the region, but not a reckless or fool hardy one---and
that it will not tolerate recklessness on behalf of its allies.

However, Japan must prepare for the worst. Pursuing independent
diplomatic relationships with Australia, both Koreas, Russia, India,
Southeast Asian states, and especially China is essential if Japan
intends to have some say in its geopolitical fate. The sheer number of
states in the region means that there is a plethora of relationships
that can be built on any number of issues. **[To a certain extent Japan
is already doing this as evidenced by its pursuit of Australian arms
contracts and defense cooperation with India]{.underline}**. **[However,
defense collaboration cannot be the go-to issue because it will likely
make China nervous about Japanese intentions]{.underline}**. **[This is
especially so when coupled with Prime Minister Abe's efforts to rewrite
Article 9.]{.underline}**

**[Hence, the major focus of Japan's diplomacy should be to balance the
relationships between the US and its regional allies and
China]{.underline}**. Japan is likely to be swept into China's economic
orbit by dint of proximity like South Korea and other states. This can
be beneficial. Closer ties improve the economic fortunes of all
involved. More crucially Japan, South Korea, and the US would constitute
a trillion dollar share of China's overall imports and exports. That is
massive leverage if the bloc can be coordinated effectively.
Importantly, this should not be pursued to punish China, but to check
its excesses.

**[As China rises, states will need to learn how to operate in the first
global multipolar system. Nothing]{.underline}** of this scale has ever
existed in human history. **[Japan sits in a precarious
position]{.underline}**. It **[is geographically isolated and dependent
on relationships with other states for its economic and physical
survival]{.underline}**. **[If it were to seek any degree of self
sufficiency or assert greater power in the region it would likely
trigger an instability spiral that could lead to war.]{.underline}**
**[Japan will have to live with a degree of insecurity for the
foreseeable future.]{.underline}** Yet by pursuing prudent, peaceful,
and profitable relationships with other states in the region it can
slowly change the perception of those states. This would allow for wider
latitude and build trust in a mistrustful area.

### 2NC -- Japan-Taiwan Alliance

#### Japan is increasingly depending on US support and coordination with Taiwan for security -- plan reverses that trend

**Wang 5/29** (Howard, China Program Assistant at the Jamestown
Foundation and an M.P.P. candidate at Georgetown University's McCourt
School of Public Policy, 2019, "Japan Considers a New Security
Relationship Via "Networking" with Taiwan",
<https://jamestown.org/program/japan-considers-a-new-security-relationship-via-networking-with-taiwan/>,
Aly M)

In early May 2019, Japanese Foreign Minister (FM) Taro Kono tweeted
support for Taiwan's bid to attend the World Health Assembly as an
observer---thereby advocating for Taiwan's return to a status it
previously held from 2009 until 2016, when the World Health Organization
ceased inviting Taiwan at the request of the People's Republic of China
(PRC) (Twitter, May 7; Focus Taiwan, May 8). **[While Taiwan has long
enjoyed U.S advocacy for limited participation in some international
organizations, Kono's tweet represented the first time that Japan has
explicitly voiced similar endorsements in the face of PRC
objections]{.underline}** (Japan Times, May 8).**[\
This development is only the latest in a recent trend of increasing
Japanese support for Taiwan's international presence. For example, Japan
has also formally endorsed Taiwan's bid to join the Comprehensive and
Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade
agreement, and has reportedly been considering establishing a formal
security dialogue with Taiwan's government]{.underline}** (Taipei Times,
February 19; Taiwan News, March 5). However, improving relations with
Taiwan also carries the necessary corollary of worsening relations with
the PRC. While Japan and the PRC approached a tentative rapprochement in
2018 around the fortieth anniversary of the Treaty of Peace and
Friendship, and while Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo continues to
describe Sino-Japanese relations as "fully returned to their normal
path," underlying tensions driven by territorial disputes and a growing
military imbalance remain unresolved (China Brief, May 31, 2018; Abe
Shinzo, January 28).\
**[Such is the context in which Japan-Taiwan relations should be
understood: Japan faces an increasingly aggressive PRC, and is therefore
seeking increasing cohesion between U.S. allies and partners in the
Indo-Pacific as a key pillar of its foreign policy. This is a process
that Japan's foreign minister has called "networking"]{.underline}**
(Taro Kono, January 28). **[Japanese networking is typically defined as
a policy of enhancing Japan's security cooperation alongside other
nations within the American hub-and-spoke network of bilateral military
alliances in the Pacific]{.underline}** (Asan Forum, February 2016).
\[1\]\
**[Japan's latest Diplomatic Bluebook describes the policy as
reinforcing the U.S.-Japan "alliance network by strengthening
multilayered cooperative relationships with allies and partners, with
the Japan-U.S. Alliance as the cornerstone," and further notes that
Japan has for several years also pursued such a relationship with
Australia and India]{.underline}** (Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan),
October 1, 2018). **[This has been further underpinned by a reaffirmed
U.S. partnership with Taiwan and unabated military tensions with the
PRC. Japan appears to be explicitly improving bilateral ties with Taiwan
in non-security capacities, while debating the potential role of the
island state as a potential partner for "networking" in regional
security.\]{.underline}**
Japan Considers Security Networking with Taiwan\
Japan's networking in pursuit of a favorable security environment does
not necessarily mean a narrow focus on security dialogues or joint
military exercises. Cultural, ideological, and political values matter
in securing partners against an authoritarian PRC, and deepening ties
with allies can reflect and reinforce these shared values even without
explicit security cooperation. FM Taro Kono's speech at the opening of
the 198th Session of the Diet presented an expansive scope for
networking: one in which Japan will seek to improve ties not only with
"countries sharing strategic interests," but also with "countries that
share common values" including "democracy, basic human rights, the rule
of law and respect for international laws" (Taro Kono, January 28).\
Due to the complex nature of Japan-PRC relations, Japanese networking
with Taiwan has not yet reached the level of overt security cooperation.
Much as the U.S. has reaffirmed its commitment to Taiwan without
exceeding the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), \[2\] the
government of Prime Minister Abe has maintained an official policy of
keeping Japan-Taiwan relations at the non-governmental level, pursuant
to the 1972 Japan-China Joint Communique (Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(Japan), October 1, 2018).\
For its part, the administration of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen
(蔡英文) has openly advocated for establishing quasi-official ties
beyond the 1972 restrictions. **[President Tsai explicitly called for
official dialogue on Japan-Taiwan security cooperation in an early March
interview with The Sankei Shimbun]{.underline}** (Sankei Shimbun, March
3). More specifically, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to Japan Frank Hsieh
(Xie Changting, 謝長廷) and Tsai herself have publicly sought Japanese
support for Taiwan's joining the CPTPP, and for formalizing relations
between the two nations. Hsieh has also called on Japan to adopt the
long-discussed "Basic Law on Japan-Taiwan Relations" (Ri-Tai Jiaoliu
Jibenfa, 日台交流基本法), commonly considered a Japanese version of the
American TRA (Epoch Times, January 29).\
Tsai's and Hsieh's economic appeals have been generally well-received:
Japan officially welcomed Taiwan's bid to join the CPTPP, and is
entertaining unofficial proposals to offer Taiwan broader diplomatic
support in exchange for Taiwan's commitment to end its ban on importing
food from Japan's Fukushima region (Taiwan News, May 3; Taiwan News, May
8). However, Japan did not affirm Tsai's call for an official security
dialogue, and quietly declined through unnamed sources in PRC and
Taiwanese newspapers without issuing a formal statement (Focus Taiwan,
March 5).\
**[Despite this avoidance of any formal commitments, Japan may in fact
have already begun discreet networking operations: for example, Taiwan's
indigenous submarine industry, the development of which has been a
longstanding priority of Tsai Ing-wen and her political party, has
reportedly received unofficial support from Japanese experts. Further,
current models for Taiwan's indigenous defense submarines conspicuously
resemble Japan's Soryu-class submarines, suggesting more significant
Japanese involvement than has been officially revealed]{.underline}**
(SCMP, July 14, 2018; New Frontier Foundation, March 2014; Taiwan News,
August 21, 2018; Shephard News, May 10, 2019; Kyodo News, May 9, 2019).
**[The salient question is not whether Japanese interest in formal
Japan-Taiwan security cooperation exists; rather, it is whether and how
this interest can evolve from discreet support to national policy in the
face of determined opposition from Beijing.\
Japan's soft rejection of Tsai's dialogue request was a move intended to
keep Tokyo's options open, while avoiding embarrassment for
Taipei.]{.underline}** However, ever-rising aggressions from Beijing
could lead to a growing openness in Tokyo to some sort of security
cooperation akin to the TRA. **[Moreover, the increasing prominence of
Japanese public officials calling for precisely such an agreement
indicates growing support for the idea in Japanese domestic
politics.\]{.underline}**
A Basic Law for Japan-Taiwan Relations\
**[Consistent with the broader logic of networking, the political
drivers for adopting a Basic Law for Japan-Taiwan Relations have been
overwhelmingly focused on forming a geopolitical coalition able to
resist the growing political and military influence of the
PRC.]{.underline}** Three Japanese public figures have emerged as strong
proponents of enhanced Japan-Taiwan security ties: Takei Tomohisa,
Suzuki Keisuke, and Nagashima Akihisa.\
**[In 2018, retired Admiral Takei Tomohisa, a former Chief of Staff of
Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) and a longtime observer of
Chinese advances in naval power, began to advocate for the establishment
of formal communication mechanisms between the Japanese MSDF and
Taiwanese naval forces in order to "resist" expanding PRC military power
and its potential to "change the status quo in the
region"]{.underline}** (Epoch Times, May 3, 2018; The Japan Times, July
30, 2015). Takei compared this proposed mechanism to the emergency
communication system in place between Japan and the PRC to avoid
accidental collisions and escalations between Japanese Self-Defense
Forces (SDF) and the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The Sino-Japanese
variant was established to alleviate tensions resulting from PLA jets
approaching Japan-claimed airspace and SDF jets scrambling to intercept;
by contrast, a similar mechanism linking the SDF and Taiwan's military
would be a transparent networking of regional militaries balancing
against the PLA (Mainichi, June 8, 2018; Asahi Shimbun, June 8, 2018).\
**[Suzuki Keisuke, a member of PM Abe's Liberal Democratic Party and
Ranking Member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the House of
Representatives, has similarly raised the specter of the PLA threat in
order to urge formal Japan-Taiwan security cooperation]{.underline}**
(Suzuki Keisuke, undated). Since 2016, Suzuki has repeatedly emphasized
the threat posed by a modernizing and increasingly aggressive PLA---and
by extension, the need for Japan to take measures to form a military
coalition able to check PLA expansion (Japan Times, December 14, 2016).
**[Suzuki has also identified Chinese Communist Party (CCP) influence in
Taiwan's democracy as a critical national security threat for
Japan.]{.underline}** Pointing to the slow erosion of democratic norms
and civil rights in Hong Kong, and concerned that similar developments
in Taipei could presage an adverse security environment for Japan,
Suzuki has repeatedly but cautiously advocated for a Japanese version of
the TRA to secure Taiwan's political independence (Epoch Times, April
19; Epoch Times, April 20; The Japan Times, December 14, 2016). This
year, Suzuki publicly hinted at the possibility that he would draft a
Japanese TRA bill for introduction in the Diet (Liberty Times, April 19;
Taiwan News, April 19).\
**[Nagashima Akihisa, an independent member of the House of
Representatives and a longtime fixture of the Japanese foreign policy
community, has long advocated increased Taiwanese military capabilities
in order to check the PLA]{.underline}** (Nagashima Akihisa, undated).
**[Nagashima has called for a Taiwanese military buildup, as well as
closer military coordination between Taiwan and American allies in the
Western Pacific]{.underline}** (Taipei Times, September 17, 2017).
Nagashima is also a fixture at the newly-formed Japan-US-Taiwan
Relations Institute (JUST), which advocates for Taiwan's inclusion in
multilateral humanitarian assistance and disaster relief partnerships,
as well as in a possible Oceanic Security Alliance (Haiyang Anbao
Lianmeng 海洋安保聯盟) (Central News Agency (Taiwan), December 3, 2018).
Though Nagashima and JUST have distinctly multilateral visions for
Taiwan's international presence beyond the Japan-Taiwan bilateral
relationship, both champion a Basic Law for Japan-Taiwan Relations as an
initial effort.\
Conclusions\
**[While it remains unclear whether passage of a Basic Law or any
comparable corollary for the TRA is viable in Japan, there exists
growing support for increased Japan-Taiwan engagement. Divergent agendas
related to Taiwan cover a broad spectrum: ranging from a proposed
bilateral relationship, to strict military-to-military agreements, to a
Japanese TRA, to Taiwan's integration into a formal security alliance.
However, all of these approaches share common assumptions: that the PLA
is a rising military threat; that Japan must act to form a coalition
counterbalancing the PLA; and that Taiwan is a critical potential
partner in this effort.]{.underline}**

**[Trump had not yet been inaugurated when Abe hopped on a plane,
uninvited, to meet with the president-elect at Trump Tower. Since then,
Abe has golfed with Trump three times; visited Mar-a-Lago twice; gifted
him a golf club worth nearly \$3,800; dropped in on First Lady Melania
Trump's birthday dinner; and even, according to Trump himself, nominated
Trump for a Nobel Prize. The two leaders have had 10 personal meetings
and spoken 30 other times. "That is absolutely unprecedented," says a
senior Trump administration official. Speaking to reporters on Thursday,
Trump boasted that Abe had assured him of his state visit: "I am the
guest, meaning the United States is the guest, but Prime Minister Abe
said to me, very specifically, 'You are the guest of honor. There's only
one guest of honor.'"\

a vision of a strong Japan more than any leader in
decades.]{.underline}** Prostrating himself before Trump has put him in
an awkward position. Trump is personally unpopular in Japan, and even
apart from that, no one likes to see Japan's prime minister bend his
behavior, or travel schedule, around other leaders. "The Japanese public
does not like our leader to entertain another country's leader," said
Koji Murata, a professor of political science at Doshisha University in
Kyoto.\
So why the desperate overtures to the U.S. president? **[To understand
Abe's surprising relationship to Trump is to understand the deep
insecurity that has developed in Japan in recent years. With its
once-powerhouse economy long-stagnant, the world-historical rise of
China, which Japan's imperial army badly abused during the war, has
stoked deep alarm. North Korea continues to develop nuclear weapons and
missiles capable of delivering them to Japan---and relations with South
Korea, the regional power best positioned to help Tokyo counterbalance
these threats, are at their lowest point in many years. Even Russia
harasses Japanese airspace as part of a dispute over contested northern
islands.\
Trump has only made this situation more precarious for Abe and his
compatriots. With its pacifist constitution and a military far smaller
than its status as the world's third-largest economy would imply, Japan
needs America's protection---and finds itself staring across the Pacific
at an erratic partner easily dismissive of longtime global commitments.
The fear that the U.S.-Japan alliance could be in jeopardy was one I
heard from numerous government officials and academics I met during a
weeklong visit to Japan earlier this year. And, they say, Abe will do
what he must to maintain it, whatever the cost to his personal
pride.]{.underline}**\
"People in Japan understand that Mr. Trump is quite unpredictable, and
that we need to treat him in a different way," said Murata.\
**["They need the relationship for their own protection," adds Jeffrey
Prescott, a former Obama White House national security council aide who
served as senior Asia adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden.
"They're worried about being caught out in the cold."\]{.underline}**
When Abe visited the U.S. last year, Trump startled him with a blunt
historical reference: "I remember Pearl Harbor," Trump cracked,
reportedly launching into a complaint about Japan's economic policies.
However impolitic his remark may have been, Trump is right to think that
World War II continues to rule America's relationship with Japan. But a
more defining moment than the 1941 surprise attack on America's Pacific
fleet is what happened four years later in Hiroshima, when the U.S.
punctuated the final days of the war by dropping an atomic bomb on the
city, raising ground temperatures nearby to 5,000 degrees and instantly
killing up to 80,000 people.\
Today, the modest port city, also known for baseball and its symphony
orchestra, has become a living monument to the horror of war, and also a
place to contemplate the oddity of Japan's continued dependency on the
country that crushed it in anger nearly 75 years ago. Nine days after
the blast, and after the U.S. dropped another atomic bomb, this time on
Nagasaki, Emperor Hirohito---whose grandson, Naruhito, Trump will visit
in Tokyo on Monday---announced his country's unconditional surrender to
America. Thus began a long and fraught dependency that continues to this
day.\
It was an incredible twist of history when the conquered nation,
emerging from a fascist nightmare, actually welcomed its new occupiers
after the war. "The Americans arrived anticipating, many of them, a
traumatic confrontation with fanatical emperor worshippers. They were
accosted instead by women who called 'yoo hoo' to the first troops
landing on the beaches in full battle gear, and men who bowed and asked
what their conquerors wished," writes John W. Dower in his Pulitzer
Prize-wining history of postwar Japan, Embracing Defeat. William
Manchester's epic biography of Douglas MacArthur recounts the moment one
of the general's aides first stepped off a plane in a freshly-defeated
Japan, which MacArther was tasked with running and rebuilding after the
war: "Instantly, a mob of howling Japanese headed for him. He was
reaching for his weapon when they braked to a halt, bowed, smiled, and
offered him a cup of orangeade."\
Those events occurred a few months before Trump was born, so he does not
actually "remember" any of them. **[But even though Japan has been
remade since, it remains conspicuously eager to please American leaders.
In large measure that is because Japan cannot properly defend
itself.]{.underline}** After World War II, Japan was demilitarized to
prevent a repeat of the fascist militarism that led to its brutal
conquest of much of East Asia. The U.S. oversaw the adoption of a peace
constitution prohibiting a standing military---Japan technically
maintains modest "self-defense forces"---and declaring that its people
"forever renounce war" and "the threat or use of force as a means of
settling disputes." And in the only country to experience an atomic
attack, nuclear weapons have been out of the question. Conveniently, the
U.S. was happy to station troops in the country as a way of projecting
power into the Asia-Pacific region, first as a check against the Soviet
Union and more recently against China. America has also explicitly
covered Japan with its "nuclear umbrella," shielding it from attack with
the ultimate form of deterrence.\
For several decades, the arrangement made sense for a Japan that faced
few credible military threats. **[But the 21st century has changed past
assumptions with startling speed. China's explosion of growth has led to
alarming new territorial claims; Tokyo's historic rival, which Japan
raped and pillaged in the 1930s and 1940s, now has a defense budget
about 10 times larger than Japan's. Meanwhile, North Korea, whose state
media has branded Abe an "Asian Hitler" has developed a large nuclear
arsenal and ever-more sophisticated missiles, which it sometimes fires
over Japan's territory.\
Japan's relations with South Korea, an important political and economic
power, are also at what regional experts call a 50-year low, poisoned by
an ongoing dispute over what Japan owes to forced laborers and so-called
"comfort women" during its wartime occupation of the Korean peninsula.
Japan was scandalized in February when a South Korean legislator
referred to Japan's then-emperor, since succeeded by Naruhito, as the
son of a war criminal. (One long-term nightmare here: a unified, hostile
Korea.) Even relations with Russia are tense, also thanks to the legacy
of World War II, in the form of a territorial dispute over remote
islands most of the world has never heard of; a Japanese legislator was
recently expelled from the country's Diet after suggesting (albeit
drunkenly) that war with Russia might be necessary to reclaim them.\
In sum, Japan looks around and sees enemies and rivals that recall
brutal Japanese occupation, and too few close friends. That leaves it as
dependent on the U.S. as it has been in years.\
At the same time, it is as worried as it's ever been about whether
America can be relied upon. In the Trump era, the U.S. has become
inscrutable, unpredictable and potentially unreliable.\]{.underline}**
People here are keenly aware of Trump's complaints about the cost of
American bases overseas and his questions about long-standing alliances.
**["We're basically protecting Japan," Trump said as a candidate. "If
we're attacked, they do not have to come to our defense. If they're
attacked, we have to come totally to their defense. And ... that's a
real problem." Trump hasn't spoken that way in a while, but Japanese
officials have watched his continued skepticism about the costs and
mission of the NATO alliance, and ongoing complaints about the expense
of maintaining U.S. troops in South Korea, with great unease. In
meetings with diplomats and military strategists, most of whom would
only speak off the record, I was told repeatedly that a scaled back U.S.
presence in Asia, perhaps as a concession in a nuclear deal with North
Korea, would be a "disaster" or "nightmare."]{.underline}** Never mind
the 50,000 troops now stationed in Japan itself.\
Japan isn't totally defenseless without its American military bodyguard.
**[Thanks to China's muscle-flexing, the passage of time and Abe's
nationalistic leadership, Japan in recent years has gradually been
expanding its military's size and legal capabilities. Trump officials,
more than Obama ones before them, have wholeheartedly embraced the
shift, which Trump will implicitly endorse this weekend when he visits a
Japanese navy helicopter carrier set for an upgrade that will allow it
to carry advanced American-made F-35B fighter jets.\]{.underline}**
But Japan also needs American in other ways. Its diplomats have urged
the U.S. to help mediate its dispute with South Korea---though to little
avail. ("In somewhat more normal times," says Mike Green, a former top
Asia official in the George W. Bush White House now at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a big question around Trump's trip
would be, "What is the administration doing to patch up ties between our
two closest allies, whose fight is weakening our position in Asia?")
Meanwhile Japan's huge but deeply troubled economy, which struggles with
slow growth and an aging population, is highly vulnerable to Trump's
whims on tariffs.\
**[That's why it's a coup for Abe and Japan that Trump, who does not
love long trips, has made the 14-hour flight to become the first foreign
leader to meet the country's newly-enthroned emperor.]{.underline}** In
recent public remarks, Trump has demonstrated only a vague understanding
of the honor, while boasting that Abe has assured him it will be "100
times bigger" than the Super Bowl.\
While there, Trump will award a specially-made trophy to the winner of a
national sumo wrestling championship, for which he will be given a
special chair in an area where even dignitaries typically sit on the
floor, cross-legged, reportedly to the annoyance of some of the sport's
diehards. In a signal of U.S. military support, Trump will also deliver
a speech at the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, in southern Japan.\
Abe's flatter-Trump campaign is more than a personal whim, it is the
result of extensive analysis. **["The Japanese have studied Trump as
thoroughly as any government, probably in the world, to try to
understand him, because the U.S.-Japan alliance is so critical," says
Green.\]{.underline}**
But it has involved some cost at home. During my visit, the lead
headline in the Japan Times described a "grilling" the prime minister
had received in the Diet over Trump's public claim a few days earlier
that Abe had written "the most beautiful five-page letter" nominating
him to the Nobel Prize committee for his nuclear diplomacy with North
Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Abe couldn't quite bring himself to confirm
the notion, which seemed strange given that the talks had made little
real progress, and that Abe had been a past skeptic of talking to Kim.
"I'm not saying it's untrue," was all he would allow. According to the
Washington Post, Abe has more than once been referred to as "poochi" in
the country's left-leaning Asahi Shimbun newspaper.\
**[Many Japanese officials argue, though, that Abe has made the best of
an awkward situation. Trump has stopped complaining about America's
security agreement with Tokyo and---unlike the case of South
Korea---hasn't made references lately to the cost of stationing troops
and equipment in Japan. Abe has helped explain to Trump how important
American assets in Japan are to containing China; U.S. Navy patrols into
the contested South China Sea often originate from the Japan's Yokosuka
base. Although Abe wasn't able to prevent Trump from slapping tariffs on
Japanese steel and aluminum exports, he has helped to delay potential
U.S. tariffs on automobiles that Japanese officials say would create a
crisis in their relationship with Washington.\
Still, there is a sense of real disquiet here about what may lie ahead.
One Japanese official told me that Trump is an effect, not a cause, of
eroding American public support for overseas alliances and
adventurism.]{.underline}** Moreover, some Japanese worry that the
character of the U.S. might be changing. **[Japan is coming to see
America "rather differently," said Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese
ambassador to Washington who now chairs the America-Japan Society in
Tokyo. "The popularity of the U.S. is decreasing," he said, as Japanese
people see an erosion of "values, respect for international
institutions, and commitment to allies."\]{.underline}**
It is unclear whether Trump will know or care about such sentiments when
he greets Emperor Naruhito on Monday. But it was those values that
America spent decades instilling in Japan as the U.S. rebuilt the nation
it had conquered after World War II. It was a process that began in
earnest when the MacArthur, having arrived in Tokyo for what would be a
seven-year term as its de facto viceroy, met with Hirohito for the first
time. President Harry Truman and MacArthur had decided by then that the
emperor had to be preserved to help earn the trust of the defeated
Japanese people. But at that point, Hirohito wasn't sure that MacArthur
wouldn't have him executed. MacArthur later recalled giving Hirohito an
American cigarette, "which he took with thanks. I noticed how his hands
shook as I lighted it for him. I tried to make it as easy for him as I
could, but I knew how deep and dreadful must be his agony of
humiliation."\
Trump will meets Hirohito's grandson under dramatically different
circumstances. **[It may be that, far from humiliation, Naruhito and Abe
will enjoy a sense of triumph at how skillfully they are playing to the
president's vanity. But something essential about the relationship
between the U.S. will be unchanged, one that will be a source of both
comfort and insecurity here for the forseeable future.]{.underline}**

**[To keep the military alliance between the U.S. and Japan sustainable
and effective during the tumult of a global power transition, both sides
need to update how they think about the "grand bargain" that underlies
it.]{.underline}** Over the past two decades, Cold War-era expectations
for the alliance were slowly and confusingly recalibrated as the world
went from two great powers completing globally to a single superpower.
**[Expectations must again be recalibrated as the world moves beyond the
current system of relative U.S. dominance. Policymakers need to start
shifting policy now to deal with the changes in China and North Korea's
capabilities.\
To sustain the alliance, especially in an era of Trump-ian bombast, the
United States and Japan need a more realistic "grand bargain." Changes
to the alliance should be designed to build on -- instead of papering
over -- the major differences between the two countries in terms of
capabilities and needs. The United States should ask for greater
Japanese leadership on issues most important to Japan, such as defense
of the Japanese homeland, in exchange for timely and generous U.S.
backup and U.S. leadership on issues of secondary importance to Japan.\
As Michael Finnegan presciently argued as early as 2009, when he was
senior research associate at the National Bureau of Asian Research, the
alliance is challenged by the daunting task of "managing unmet
expectations," overburdened by vague and superfluous
commitments.]{.underline}** During the Cold War, the "grand bargain"
between the United States and Japan was simple: Japan provided the
United States with military bases in return for the United States
granting Japan a security guarantee. The Soviet threat made
alliance-related domestic costs easier to justify to the publics in both
countries.

during a meeting Wednesday at Yokoto Air Base.\]{.underline}**
The two men also spoke to reporters, but didn\'t take any questions.\
It was Iwaya\'s first visit to USFJ headquarters since assuming his
position in October 2018.\
Iwaya also visited the headquarters of the Japan Air Self-Defense
Force\'s Air Defense Command, and later had lunch with a group of senior
leaders from Air Defense Command and USFJ.\
**[Schneider said the United States is committed to ensuring the
readiness of U.S. forces stationed in Japan through rigorous and
realistic training and exercises.\]{.underline}**
But, he added, \"there are also a greater number of challenges that we
both must contend with, which puts greater emphasis on training and
readiness and the ability to respond to whatever situations may
arise.\"\
**[The leaders said they discussed ways to further enhance bilateral
cooperation despite complex regional security challenges.\
\"I believe that Yokota Air Base is well and truly a symbol of our
ironclad alliance, hosting some of our key commands like Air Defense
Command, USFJ and 5th Air Force,\" Iwaya said. \"I\'d like to extend my
heartfelt respect for your work as you have been dedicating yourself not
only to the peace and stability in this country, but also the region on
behalf of U.S. forces.\"\
Schneider said that he is \"convinced that the alliance between our two
nations has never been stronger.\"\
The nations are strategically aligned, he said, \"which provides great
benefits to stability, security and strength, not only for our two
nations, but the entire region.\"\
Schneider also said he\'s committed to ensuring the readiness of 54,000
U.S. military personnel stationed in Japan through rigorous and
realistic training and exercises.\
The United States and Japan conducted the biennial Keen Sword exercise,
which involved 10,000 American personnel and 47,000 Japanese troops,
last October and November. The two nations\' forces trained in realistic
simulations of multiple mission areas to improve response capabilities
in crisis situations.\]{.underline}**
Last January, the Iron Fist 2019 multilateral training event included
the certification of Japan\'s first amphibious assault force.\
Japan\'s military has also become increasingly involved in the
protection of U.S. carriers and aircraft since the passage of a law in
2015 that allows Tokyo\'s self-defense forces to operate overseas.\
An analysis of Japanese military documents shows self-defense force
activities involving U.S. warships and aircraft rose steadily beginning
in 2017, Tokyo Shimbun reported in March.\
Japan\'s defense budget will grow to \$47 billion in fiscal 2019 \-- the
fifth consecutive year of increases. Japan already has the
seventh-largest defense budget in the world, and it\'s about 1 percent
of the gross domestic product. Conversely, China and the United States
spend between 2 percent and 3 percent of their gross domestic products
annually on defense.\

China's growing conventional anti-access/area-denial capabilities and

**[It is difficult to overstate how dysfunctional America's security
policy is when it comes to democratic Taiwan. Despite China's
disquieting military buildup and expansionist posture, Washington has
increasingly dithered on meeting its legal and moral commitments to
Taiwan's defense.]{.underline}** The trouble began during the Bush
administration, when Washington shocked Taipei by refusing to accept a
letter of request for three squadrons of new F-16 fighter jets.\
Things deteriorated further when the Bush White House proved unable to
deliver on its promise to assist Taiwan in acquiring diesel-electric
submarines at a price Taipei's testy parliament could accept. Even
worse, the administration tried to curtail the Ministry of National
Defense's homemade cruise missile project ― a legitimate capability
needed for deterring Chinese ballistic missile strikes on Taiwan's
cities.\
The Obama administration delivered an even more lackluster performance.
It refused Taiwan's repeated requests for new fighter jets, while
actively marketing low-end, cheap capabilities that seemed calculated to
be inoffensive to China. In 2014, Taiwan's government, by now aware of
Washington's self-limiting approach to Beijing, proudly announced its
resolve to build its own submarines and invited America to join other
countries in providing selected technical knowhow in a low-key fashion.\
The invitation backfired. In response, Obama's team forbade the American
defense industry from competing for access to the Indigenous Defense
Submarine program. **[They then went on a rhetorical campaign to erode
Taiwan's confidence that it could and should go forward with the
submarine build, which enjoyed widespread bipartisan support on the
island. This was a remarkable reversal of what Pentagon experts under
Clinton and Bush had previously counseled: namely, that submarines were
an ideal asymmetric capability and necessary for defending against
Chinese invasion.]{.underline}**\
**[The absence of top-tier arms sales to Taiwan has directly contributed
to an imbalanced security situation across the Strait. The American
decisions to withhold support for a next generation Taiwanese air force
and navy have negatively impacted the perceived reliability of the
United States. This is true not just in Taipei, but also in Tokyo, where
the Japanese foreign policy elite regard Taiwan's fate as tightly
intertwined with their own.]{.underline}**

in the dust. While Trump's approach to China remains unclear --- and
many in Tokyo worry that Trump may be flirting with the idea of using
Taiwan as a bargaining chip --- his aggressive posture on economic
issues and signs of initial hawkishness have given the Japanese some
reassurance and cause for hope that the alliance will continue to play a

not tip the military balance over the strait; China's defense budget is
more than 20 times that of Taiwan's and it would maintain considerably
more forces in the event of a conflict.\

renewed U.S. commitment to the island's defense.]{.underline}** It would
be the first fighter jet sale since 1992; a similar request was rejected
in 2011 and the existing fleet was upgraded instead. **[That complements
last year's decision by the Trump administration to approve a \$1.4
billion arms sale to Taiwan.\]{.underline}**
Also last month, two U.S. warships crossed through the Taiwan Strait,
the latest in a series of transits --- the fifth since the U.S. Navy
resumed sending surface combatants through the strait in July 2018 ---
that "demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.
The U.S. Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere
international law allows," the U.S. Pacific Fleet explained.\
Finally, the U.S. allowed Tsai to make a transit stop in Hawaii after
her tour of South Pacific islands to shore up diplomatic support. This
is part of a broad expansion of contacts between the governments of
Taiwan and the U.S.\
Beijing has been outraged by all these developments. Its foreign
ministry lodged "stern representations" upon news reports of the weapons
sale; the defense ministry said that China was "firmly opposed" to those
arms sales and military exchanges between the U.S. and Taiwan. They also
warned the U.S. to "recognize the high sensitivity and serious harm" of
the issue and "avoid serious damage to China-U.S. cooperation," a
statement that sounded especially ominous as U.S. negotiators were
arriving that day for trade talks.\
Taiwanese officials have warned that they would shoot down a subsequent
intrusion by Chinese jets. In a Facebook post, Tsai said she "ordered
the military to forcefully expel any incursions across the 'median line'
immediately." Such a reaction is natural to territorial intrusions but
it would give China an excuse to escalate, which could then prompt a
U.S. response. **[Washington must be careful, then, to give Taiwan the
means to defend itself and feel confident in its capabilities, without
encouraging it to be reckless and provocative.\
Cross-strait tensions have profound implications for Japan, Taiwan's
closest partner in the region. Japan is Taiwan's third-largest trading
partner, while Taiwan is Japan's fourth-largest trading partner, with
bilateral trade reaching \$67.2 billion in 2018, a 7.2 percent increase
from 2017. Japan is the fourth-largest source of foreign investment in
Taiwan, with over \$20 billion in cumulative investment the end of 2018.
Japan has long recognized that the defense of Taiwan is integral to its
own security. Navigating between Taipei and Beijing has long been a
challenge for Tokyo and it is getting harder. Japan should counsel
restraint on all sides, and insist on the peaceful and diplomatic
resolution of all disputes.]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Perception

#### Japan perceives Taiwanese abandonment because of its strategic viability

**Lee and Schreer** 20**13** -- Sheryn Lee is a PhD student in Political
Science at the University of Pennsylvania. Benjamin Schreer is Senior
Analyst for Defence Strategy at the Australian Strategic Policy
Institute (ASPI) in Canberra ("The Taiwan Strait: Still Dangerous,"
*Survival* Vol. 55 no. 3) bhb

That the United States might simply give up on Taiwan, however, is one
of the greatest myths of modern global politics.14 Reputation is often a
major influence on a state's decision to go to war.15 **[Washington's
commitment to Taiwan is becoming even more important as an indicator for
the credibility of America's 'rebalance' towards the Asia-Pacific. There
is great uncertainty among Asian allies of whether the coming US
defence-budget cuts will lead to at least a partial withdrawal of
American troops from the region]{.underline}**. In particular, **[Japan
anxiously watches for signals that the United States might be
'abandoning' Taiwan]{.underline}**.

Taiwan will not fall victim to some great bargain between China and the
US over spheres of influence in East Asia. Instead, the Pentagon is
looking for a credible war-fighting doctrine to reassure its allies and
partners about US forces' continued ability and resolve to project
military power even in maritime zones contested by the PLA. Part of its
response to China's A2/AD strategy is **[the Air-Sea Battle
concept]{.underline}**, which **[makes Taiwan a front-line
state]{.underline}**. The ROC is uniquely positioned to provide the
United States with access and situational awareness about PLA air,
space, sea and cyber domains.16

**[Taiwan is thus even more important for the United States and
Japan]{.underline}** as the PLA looks to project naval power beyond the
Taiwan Strait. To do this, it will have to overcome the chokepoint
created by highly sophisticated US and allied capabilities to monitor
and track the PLA Navy once it enters the Western Pacific. **[Without
controlling Taiwan, the PLA will find it]{.underline}** very
**[difficult to escape]{.underline}** this tyranny of geography that
allows the US and its allies to deny the PLA control of the seas in the
Taiwan Strait and beyond. The 2013 QDR stresses that Taiwan is 'located
in the center position of **[the First Island Chain]{.underline}** in
the Western Pacific and possesses geo-strategic importance' and that it
will 'service \[its related\] strategic warning function'.17

#### US Japan alliance key to solve a litany of threats---only a [certain]{.underline}, [unwavering]{.underline} commitment to the alliance can make that possible

**Le and Miller 17**---Assistant Professor of Politics at Pomona
College; international affairs fellow with the Council on Foreign
Relations and a senior fellow with the EastWest Institute (Tom and J.

The Way Forward **[Alliances require transparency, dependability and
mutual respect]{.underline}**. Prior to the Trump-Abe meeting, a senior
Abe advisor suggested that he not take Trump's remarks concerning the
alliance literally. Still, **[even a figurative interpretation of
Trump's anti-alliance remarks does not instill confidence in the
alliance]{.underline}**. Indeed, the Trump administration should look at
alliances as mutually beneficial and not see them with a mercenary lens.
It will be difficult for Abe to pursue costly and controversial
normalization policies without a guarantee that the United States will
be there to support him every step of the way. Additionally, without
strong support from Washington, DC for TPP and a strong U.S.-Japan
alliance, Tokyo does not have the resources to pursue major
foreign-policy changes alone. **[A wavering or uncertain United States
commitment has several implications for the region]{.underline}**.
**[The United States has historically been the "cork in the bottle" in
East Asia]{.underline}**. **[Without the United States, Japanese
security policies may be interpreted as aggressive by Japan's
neighbors]{.underline}**. **[Already, conservatives in Japan see the
United States' withdrawal from the region as an opportunity to
strengthen the nation's military posture]{.underline}**. The volatility
in the region underpins the need for Japan to mobilize the diplomatic
capital it has amassed under Abe's tenure in order to push forward the
rules-based liberal order. Abe should look to drive forward the
expansive---but still relatively nascent---security network in the
region made up of several U.S. allies and partners. Specifically, Abe
should take it upon himself to stress the importance of these
trilaterals (such as U.S.-Japan-Australia, U.S.-Japan-India,
U.S.-Japan-ROK, etc.) to Trump. **[Abe will rely on these relationships
and nurturing diplomatic and political investments with like-minded
states in the region as a soft or complementary hedge to potential U.S.
drift on Asia under Trump]{.underline}**. **[While it is clear that
Trump will not pursue]{.underline}** U.S. **[involvement in the TPP,
there is much uncertainty on the rest of his foreign-policy leanings in
East Asia]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[while Trump may have a preference
towards bilateral alliances and a transactional approach to security
relationships, it remains premature and unrealistic to conclude that the
United States will back Asia's overlapping security
networks]{.underline}**. **[For these reasons, it will be important for
Japan and the United States to work together as leaders on regional
security]{.underline}**. Essentially, **[the U.S.-Japan alliance should
be used as a cornerstone]{.underline}**---or starting point---**[for
security networks in the region]{.underline}**. **[Increasingly, this
cooperation is intended to provide and protect more "public goods" in
the region, such as free and open sea lanes, a fast and effective
response to natural disasters, and common approaches to transnational
crime, terrorism and counterproliferation]{.underline}**.

#### Japan doesn't care about technicalities of our Taiwan commitment---plan signals abandonment

**Fitzpatrick, 16**---Executive Director, IISS-Americas (Mark, *Asia's
Latent Nuclear Powers* pg 104-105)

Japanese strategists understand that the Ukraine and Syria cases did not
involve US security commitments. **[More analogous to Japan's situation
would be US failure to come to the assistance of]{.underline}** a
defence partner, such as if China threatened **[Taiwan. The concerning
scenario need not involve conflict. If Washington were to cut Taiwan
adrift in deference to greater US national interests]{.underline}**, as
some American pundits have argued (see Chapter Three), **[it would give
the Japanese reason to question the durability of the US commitment in
their own case. The fact that the US does not have a treaty commitment
to defend Taiwan, as distinct from the commitment to Japan, would
probably be lost in terms of perception]{.underline}**. China's
ever-growing dominance as a US trade partner141 already gives rise to
nightmares in Japan that the US might someday choose China over Japan.

### AT Glaser

#### The aff [fractures]{.underline} allied faith in the regional security order

**Jackson, 15---**PhD, Visiting Fellow at the Center for a New American
Security and a Council on Foreign Relations International Affairs Fellow
(Van, "The Myth of a US-China Grand Bargain,"
<http://thediplomat.com/2015/08/the-myth-of-a-us-china-grand-bargain/>)

**[The latest salvo in this "America must accommodate China" literature
hails from]{.underline}** an accomplished political scientist at George
Washington University, Charles **[Glaser]{.underline}**, writing in the
most recent issue of International Security. Glaser makes the sweeping
and somewhat unhelpful claim that military competition is risky and
therefore undesirable. As an alternative **[he suggests
that]{.underline}** if only **[the United States]{.underline}** would
**[abandon commitments to Taiwan]{.underline}**, China would be willing
to resolve its territorial disputes in the East and South China Sea,
thereby sidestepping military competition.

Prior to around 2008, proposals for U.S. accommodation of a rising China
made much more sense, or at least could be taken more seriously. But
times have changed. China's ambitions have changed. And so has its
foreign policy behavior. These contextual changes matter for whether and
when accommodation can have the desired effect. More to the point
though, there are a number of problems with the grand bargain line of
argumentation.

First, **[any proposal for a Sino-U.S. solution to regional problems is
by]{.underline}** definition **[taking a great power view of Asia that
marginalizes the agency and strategic relevance of U.S. allies and the
region's middle powers]{.underline}**. In the brief period (five to ten
years ago) when a G-2 concept was taken semi-seriously in Washington,
allies---especially South Korea and Japan---chafed. **[The region's
middle powers would be unlikely to simply follow the joint dictates of
China and the United States without being part of it, and
attempting]{.underline}** a G-2 **[could ironically create a more
fragmented order as a result]{.underline}**. Including others, at any
rate, is antithetical to the concept of a Sino-U.S. G-2 arrangement. As
early as the 1960s U.S. officials tried to rely on China to deal with
regional issues spanning from North Korea to Vietnam. It was almost
always to no avail.

Second, and as I've written about extensively elsewhere, **[Asia is rife
with security concerns that have nothing to do with China directly, so
any understanding reached with China would leave unresolved many of the
region's latent sources of potential conflict. Sino-U.S. grand bargain
proponents forget that China and the United States only have real
conflicts of interest by proxy. Every conceivable conflict scenario
involves China and some other Asian state---Taiwan, Japan, the
Philippines, Korea. The United States only becomes part of the picture
because of a commitment to regional order, including its alliance
network]{.underline}**.

Third, as its recent stock market crash makes all too obvious, China
remains a "fragile superpower," to quote Susan Shirk. Many factors in
its domestic political situation---corruption, growing wealth
disparities, and many forms of civil challenges to government
legitimacy---make it an unpredictable player. Nor is China showing
meaningful signs of political liberalization. There's so much brewing
underneath the surface in China that dealing with China today as if it
were a hegemon tomorrow assumes too much, and grants China too much
credit too soon.

Fourth, there's a defunct theory that's been smuggled into arguments
about changing Chinese behavior through U.S. accommodation. Political
scientists call it "neofunctionalism," a term rarely used these days,
even though its spirit is pervasive in grand bargain arguments.
Neofunctionalism came about in the 1950s as a failed way to account for
and push for European integration.The basic idea involved an assumption
that low level and innocuous types of cooperation would "spillover" into
still more and better quality cooperation. Comity among nations, it was
thought, would be the eventual outcome of mundane socioeconomic
interactions. But by the 1970s, the theory had become largely
discredited.

Nevertheless, echoes of neofunctionalism remain in contemporary claims
that properly calibrated restraint, accommodation, or appeasement can
have a transformative effect on a relationship. Ironically, these
arguments tend to come from scholars, not policymakers. The idea that
the United States can induce China into resolving its East and South
China Sea disputes by "giving" it Taiwan reflects precisely this type of
expectation, as do calls for the United States to make small concessions
to China in hopes that it will enable a more stable situation.

None of this means that accommodative gestures or strategies should be
outright dismissed. There were numerous periods of detente with the
Soviet Union during the Cold War, and that rivalry was much more
confrontational. China and the United States, moreover, have a number of
overlapping---not just conflicting---interests. I might even go as far
as saying that neofunctionalism has a bit of a bad rap; there are times
when trivial or non-costly forms of cooperation can lead to greater and
deeper cooperation, but political scientists haven't convincingly
figured out what those conditions are.

But **[grand bargains rarely work. There's a dangerous naivete in
abandoning U.S. commitments on the hope that China will then be more
willing to resolve its other disputes. And policies of accommodation
will not suspend military competition]{.underline}** because that
involves more than present day concerns with surveillance overflight
missions, territorial disputes, and current political commitments.
Regardless of the policy and crisis management decisions we make today,
**[military competition plays out over years and decades; it relates to
force structure investment and doctrinal decisions that can't be
sacrificed for political promises]{.underline}**.

China's concerns will only be assuaged when the United States divests of
the military force structure that makes it possible to project power
globally, uphold its commitments, and bolster the regional order. The
U.S. military will be unable to pursue such a course as long as China
maintains openly expansionist geopolitical ambitions and a force
structure designed to achieve it. **[Competition]{.underline}**, it
seems, **[is the logic of the situation. We ignore that at our own
peril]{.underline}**.

### AT Military First

#### Asian allies are worried---loss of [diplomatic commitment to alliance]{.underline} caused by [concessions]{.underline} to China would [destroy]{.underline} our alliances and power projection

**Holmes 17**---professor of strategy at the Naval War College and
coauthor of Red Star over the Pacific (James, 4/4/17, "The Summit: 5
Things Trump Needs to Know before Meeting Xi Jinping,"
<http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-summit-5-things-trump-needs-know-before-meeting-xi-20023?page=show>)

**[Allies Are Watching]{.underline}** A hard fact must remain uppermost
in mind, namely this: **[America has no strategic position in Asia
without allies, and allies will afford this week's proceedings close
scrutiny]{.underline}**. **[If]{.underline}** **[Tokyo]{.underline}**,
**[Seoul]{.underline}**, **[or]{.underline}** **[Manila]{.underline}**
**[loses confidence]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration**['s determination to keep U.S.
treaty commitments in Asia, they could reduce U.S. access to harbors and
bases on their territory]{.underline}**---**[or]{.underline}**, in the
worst case, **[refuse access altogether]{.underline}**. **[That would
spell trouble for U.S. maritime strategy]{.underline}**. Sea-power
theorist Alfred Thayer **[Mahan observes that ships bereft of overseas
naval stations are like "land birds]{.underline}**," unable to fly far
from home shores. So it was when Mahan was writing a century ago; so it
remains today. U**[.S. naval and air forces can accomplish little when
operating from Guam or Hawaii, hundreds or thousands of miles from
potential battlegrounds]{.underline}**. Still less can they execute
missions in Asia from North America. For the first time since 1898,
**[the United States could find itself without the ability to mold
affairs in Asia]{.underline}**. **[Reassuring host nations is not merely
something that's nice to do. It is imperative]{.underline}** **[unless
America wants to retreat to the Western Hemisphere]{.underline}**. How
to reassure them? About sixty years ago Henry Kissinger devised a simple
formula to estimate one combatant's ability to deter another. His
formula also helps us estimate one ally's ability to reassure others
that it will keep faith with them. To riff on Kissinger's ideas,
**[reassurance is a product of capability, resolve and
belief]{.underline}**. **[Suppose U.S. leaders want to reassure
Japan]{.underline}** that they will direct U.S. forces to help defend
the Senkaku Islands. In that case **[they must]{.underline}** field
military capabilities adequate to that mission, demonstrate the gumption
to deploy those capabilities when the time comes, and **[make the
Japanese leadership and citizenry believers in American capability and
resolve]{.underline}**. **[Kissinger stresses that his equation involves
multiplication, not addition]{.underline}**. **[If any of the three
factors drops to zero, consequently, so does Washington's capacity to
reassure allies]{.underline}** and friends. (**[And]{.underline}**
**[so]{.underline}**, by the way, **[does its capacity to dismay and
deter prospective foes like China]{.underline}**.) Overpowering armed
might means little absent the willpower to use it. **[Neither capability
nor resolve avails if the ally]{.underline}**---rightly or
wrongly---**[doubts the U.S. leadership will uphold its treaty
commitments]{.underline}**. President Trump and his advisers must
maximize all three factors lest Asian governments lose confidence in
America---and make the best deals they can with Beijing, in hopes of
muting Chinese displeasure with them in a post-American Asia. **[Allies,
then, constitute a crucial audience of this week's
summitry]{.underline}**. **[They will parse every word out of
Mar-a-Lago]{.underline}**. And so will China. Sun Tzu advises sovereigns
and generals to attack their enemies' strategies and alliances first to
bolster prospects for strategic success. Sun's "Hegemonic King" is a
consummate alliance preventer and wrecker. He's big and brawny. He
overawes weaker neighbors, keeping them from making common cause against
him. And he vastly outmatches any neighbor in a one-on-one
contest---conferring crucial negotiating leverage. President
**[Xi]{.underline}**, contemporary China's Hegemonic King,
**[will]{.underline}** likewise **[be on the lookout for opportunities
to loosen the bonds between the United States and its Asian
partners]{.underline}**. **[This is a real prospect]{.underline}**.
President Trump's focus on burden sharing within U.S. alliances is
laudable, but remember: **[Asia is different than Europe]{.underline}**.
It's one thing to expect NATO allies to assume a greater share of the
load. After all, Germany is deeply embedded in European institutions.
There is approximately zero chance that Germany will rearm and go on the
march once again, and Europeans know it. Europeans, consequently, can
invest more in their common defense without the anxieties about the
titan in their midst that afflict Asians. Japan is different. **[There
was no counterpart to NATO or the European Union within which Japan
could safely rearm in the postwar years. There's still no such
counterpart]{.underline}**. The lopsided arrangement that is the
U.S.-Japan alliance---of which Japan's exceedingly frugal defense
budgets are part---is a product of decades of U.S. policy, not Japanese
freeriding on American taxpayers.

### AT Nuclear Umbrella

#### [Any signs]{.underline} of doubt wreck faith in the [whole nuclear umbrella]{.underline}---prolif is [feasible]{.underline} and [quick]{.underline}

**Edwards, 5-3**---International Producer with The Cipher Brief (Will,
"Nuclear Deterrence and Assurance in East Asia,"
<http://thecipherbrief.com/article/asia/nuclear-deterrence-and-assurance-east-asia-1090>)

**[Japan and South Korea display varying degrees of nuclear
latency]{.underline}**, that is not having nuclear weapons but
**[possessing the technological acumen and resources to quickly create
them for national defense]{.underline}**. Between the two countries,
**[Japan]{.underline}** exhibits a much higher degree of nuclear
latency. It **[has full control of its nuclear fuel
cycle]{.underline}**, meaning it is not prohibited from producing
plutonium, a fissile material, in its civilian reactor; **[its satellite
launch vehicles are large enough to carry a nuclear warhead; and it has
a domestic plutonium stockpile amounting to nearly 10
tons]{.underline}**, which by one estimate is **[enough for 1,000
weapons]{.underline}**.

South Korea by comparison cannot produce plutonium due to a legal
agreement with the U.S., which has become a contentious issue in recent
years. Seoul wants full control of its civilian nuclear program, but the
U.S. has been loath to revisit the agreement, as it opens the door for
South Korea to create its own plutonium stockpile. Seoul also has built
a satellite launch vehicle that could double as an Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile (ICBM).

In society and the political sphere, South Korea does not have the same
aversion to nuclear weapons as Japan. A survey conducted in South Korea
after North Korea's fourth nuclear test showed that around **[55 percent
of South Koreans wanted their country to develop its own nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}**. Conversely, a 2009 poll in Japan showed that
only 24 percent of Japanese wanted to repeal the laws that prohibited
its development of nuclear weapons.

Sentiments among politicians exhibit a similar trend. While outspoken
South Korean politicians, like Chung Mong Joon and Won Yoo Chel,
advocate for nuclear weapons to defend against North Korea, the Park
administration has shown no inclination towards weapons development. In
Japan the discourse is more reserved and equally against weapons
development. A former Japanese cabinet member remarked that "\[Japan\]
will not seek to produce nuclear weapons, but possessing advanced
technology and plutonium shows other nations that our country can
produce them whenever it wants. This is tantamount to a certain measure
of deterrent power.\"

For U.S policymakers, the technical abilities and domestic conditions
need to be placed in context in order to identify shifts towards nuclear
proliferation. Former chief of analysis for the CIA Nonproliferation
Center, Torrey Froscher, made clear to The Cipher Brief that "**[there
is no reason to suspect that \[either country\] is evading its
obligation to forgo nuclear weapons," but the latent capacity of either
country cannot be ignored]{.underline}**. Thomas Cynkin, a former U.S.
diplomat in Japan added that close observation of political and
technological developments is important to keeping abreast of any
changes in how either country views a homegrown nuclear weapons program.

Both Froscher and Cynkin agree that **[U.S. interest and involvement in
regional security are essential to sustaining non-proliferation in East
Asia]{.underline}**. An important lesson from the Cold War that still
underpins strategic thought on nuclear weapons was that **[a nuclear
deterrent is ineffective without a credible show of
intent.]{.underline}** Just as deterrence without intent is an
ineffective display to one's enemies, **[assurance without resolve is an
ineffective gesture to one's allies]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[the
U.S. cannot afford to allow Tokyo or Seoul to doubt its nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}**. In that regard, U.S. Ambassador to South Korea
Mark Lippert was quick to shoot down Trump's assertion that South Korea
takes care of its own security by developing nuclear weapons. Lippert
called the alliance between the U.S. and South Korea "one of the premier
military alliances in the world." **[Maintaining]{.underline}** the
**[trust]{.underline}** implicit in Lippert's message **[could be the
U.S.'s strongest hedge against nuclear proliferation in East
Asia]{.underline}**.

#### Nuclear umbrella isn't unbreakable---the plan creates [low-level anxieties]{.underline} which [spill up]{.underline}

**Fitzpatrick, 16**---Executive Director, IISS-Americas (Mark, *Asia's
Latent Nuclear Powers* pg 167-168)

The reality, however, is that **[nuclear use is neither credible nor
necessary for deterring most of the threats that America and its
partners may face in Northeast Asia]{.underline}**. Modernised
conventional capabilities can be better calibrated to counter the entire
range of potential provocations, with none of the taboos that have
become attached to nuclear weapons. Nuclear deterrence remains vital, of
course, particularly to deter nuclear threats. But **[other forms of
deterrence will come into play earlier in nearly every scenario.
Washington thus has sought assiduously to address Japanese and ROK
anxieties about low-level provocations by sustaining capabilities across
the spectrum. US non-military engagement in East Asia, including free
trade pacts and political ties, further enhances the credibility of US
deterrence]{.underline}**. Attributing special significance to a
"nuclear umbrella" helps to reassure allies, but it is a misnomer.
**[Atomic retaliation is but one threat of what must be an interwoven
fabric of the deterrence posture]{.underline}**.

### 2NC Allies

#### Allies would abandon ship

**Tucker and Glaser 2011** -- Nancy Bernkopf Tucker, Professor of
History at Georgetown University and at the Edmund A. Walsh School of
Foreign Service, she has been a fellow at the Institute for Advanced
Study, the Rockefeller Foundation (Bellagio Study Center), the Woodrow
Wilson International Center for Scholars, the United States Institute of
Peace, Harvard University, and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences as

Bonnie S. Glaser is a senior adviser for Asia and the director of the
China Power Project at CSIS, where she works on issues related to
Asia-Pacific security with a focus on Chinese foreign and security
policy. She is concomitantly a nonresident fellow with the Lowy
Institute in Sydney, Australia, and a senior associate with the Pacific
Forum ("Should the United States Abandon Taiwan?" *The Washington
Quarterly* Vol. 34, Issue 4) bhb

**[Washington\'s long-term support for Taiwan]{.underline}** also **[has
significance for]{.underline}** **[U.S. allies]{.underline}** and
friends. Asian countries which look to the United States to balance
China\'s rising power may not want Washington to squander resources and
energy on Taiwan, but were it to conversely ignore Taiwan\'s security,
they would see their own safety threatened. **[U.S.
credibility]{.underline}**, therefore, **[is at stake. U.S. inconstancy
could convince American allies and friends to rely less on Washington,
undertake an arms race, and/or bandwagon with China.]{.underline}**
After the Clinton administration dispatched two aircraft carrier battle
groups to the area around Taiwan in the 1995--1996 Taiwan Strait crisis,
the region\'s confidence in the United States soared and a wave of
counterbalancing against China occurred. Japan, Singapore, the
Philippines, and other nations all bolstered their security ties with
the United States.

**[A U.S. decision to abandon Taiwan would be particularly alarming to
Japan]{.underline}**.

Forsaking Taiwan would likely have the opposite effect. A U.S. decision
to abandon Taiwan---leading to unification of an unwilling Taiwan with
China---would be particularly alarming to Japan. Tension between China
and Japan remains high, and the resolution of chronic economic,
security, and history problems in the foreseeable future appears
unlikely. **[Dependent on sea lanes of supply and communication which
pass close to Taiwan, Tokyo would consider itself to be more vulnerable,
and it would be.]{.underline}** Japan would also be outflanked should
China decide to use Taiwan as a military platform. Contested claims to
oil fields and islands in the East and South China Seas would be more
difficult to defend. **[If Japan began to doubt U.S. reliability, that
could deal a fatal blow to the U.S.--Japan alliance.]{.underline}**
Moreover, adding to Japan\'s dismay, **[South Korea]{.underline}**,
increasingly reliant on its burgeoning economic ties with China,
**[might calculate that if the United States can sever ties to Taiwan,
Seoul could be safer renouncing its security alliance with Washington
and aligning with Beijing.]{.underline}**

The current urge to seek protection against a potentially powerful and
abusive China has made the United States more welcome across Southeast
Asia. Aware that they cannot effectively hedge against China without
U.S. collaboration, **[Southeast Asian nations]{.underline}** have
quietly repaired rifts and reinvigorated cooperation with Washington.
They welcomed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\'s declaration in
Thailand in 2009 that \"the United States is back\" in Asia. Although
they don\'t share Tokyo\'s view of Taiwan\'s geostrategic importance,
they do worry about freedom of navigation and resource claims in the
South China Sea. They **[would likely interpret a shift in U.S. policy
away from Taiwan as a signal of U.S. surrender to Chinese interests, and
eventually follow suit]{.underline}**.

First of all, early on **[they were a way of restricting the leaders of
allies and security partners of the United States from undertaking
provocative initiatives toward their adversaries that Washington would
regard as risking unnecessary and entangling conflicts]{.underline}**
(for example, Taiwan and Korea). Second, **[America's status as a
resident Asian power]{.underline}** sometimes **[gave it an opportunity
to facilitate diplomatic solutions to regional conflicts]{.underline}**
(e.g. Cambodia in 1991). Third, and most significant, **[the constant
presence of U.S. armed forces, diplomats, business executives, and other
private citizens have long had a stabilizing and positive
effect]{.underline}**. The American regional role has not been perfect
by any means. Asian publics sometimes blamed U.S. alliances and American
support for authoritarian regimes (as in the Philippines and Korea).
**[On balance]{.underline}**, however, **[the U.S.
presence,]{.underline}** **[manifested most significantly by its
alliances]{.underline}** and the forward deployment of its armed forces,
**[has kept the peace in Asia]{.underline}**. From a historical
perspective, therefore, the Obama administration's "re-balance" or
"pivot" is not a new policy at all but more an adjustment of a
decades-old strategy to new circumstances.

Deterrence and defense preparedness aside, the **[United States and its
leading allies, Japan and Korea, have recently used their alliances as
vessels for much broader policy cooperation]{.underline}**. In both
cases, **[there is growing attention to issues of security outside East
Asia (e.g. Iran's nuclear program), and]{.underline}** an array of
non-security objectives: **[global economic growth]{.underline}**;
**[sustainable development and poverty reduction]{.underline}**;
**[global health]{.underline}**; **[climate change]{.underline}**,
**[environmental protection]{.underline}**;
**[cybersecurity]{.underline}**; and **[science and technology
cooperation]{.underline}**.2 Taiwan is also engaged in similar
cooperative efforts with the United Statesa.3

Chinese officials and scholars are incorrect in assuming that the United
States views China as its new enemy, but there is a security dilemma at
play between the two countries. Even if rivalry is not inevitable,
neither is it impossible. Washington's actions may foster perceptions in
Beijing that U.S. intentions are fundamentally hostile and require a
robust response. The same may be true of China's actions and America's
response. As Harvard's Joseph Nye famously warned, "If you treat China
as an enemy, you are certain to have an enemy." Generally, the direction
of U.S. China policy might be summarized as "cooperate where we can but
contend only when we must." Washington's hope is that China will pursue
a similar approach and that areas of contention can be managed well
enough so that they don't exacerbate mutual suspicions.

The difficulty arises because the opportunities for U.S.-China
cooperation exist more on global issues like climate change and regional
problems outside of East Asia such as Iran's nuclear program. The
prospects for contention, however, are more likely in East Asia. That is
because **[East Asia is where China's revival as a great power will
first take place]{.underline}**, and it happens that the region already
has its share of medium-to-strong powers, including the United States.
From China's perspective, **[creating strategic depth into the East and
South China Seas makes sense in terms of its defense strategy, and it
has steadily built the military capabilities to create that
depth]{.underline}**. **[Yet it is encroaching into areas where other
powers' armed forces are already present]{.underline}**---first and
foremost the United States and secondarily Japan.

To make matters worse for Beijing, **[the growth of its
military]{.underline}** and para-military capabilities **[has not gone
unnoticed.]{.underline}** **[The way China has used those assets to
establish a presence it never possessed before and to advance its
territorial and maritime claims has made most of its East Asian
neighbors nervous about China's long-term intentions.]{.underline}**
**[Their default response is to align more closely with the United
States]{.underline}**, at least when it comes to security. On trade and
investment, on the other hand, they reap the benefits that stem from the
expansion of the large and modernizing Chinese economy. The last thing
that China's neighbors want is to have to make a choice between China
and the United States.

From an American perspective, **[U.S. alliances and security
partnerships in East Asia remain a force for regional
stability]{.underline}** and are not an instrument for a Cold War-style
containment of China. **[There will be frictions and contention between
China and the United States, and between China and its Asian neighbors.
The task will be to manage and contain those problems through a variety
of mechanisms: diplomacy, military confidence-building measures, and so
on]{.underline}**. Yet used properly, **[alliances can be a positive
force for managing the revival of China as a great power]{.underline}**
-- assuming that Beijing exercises restraint as it projects power
outwards. Like a policeman patrolling the neighborhood beat, the
**[continuous U.S. presence in the region]{.underline}** -- military,
diplomatic, and economic -- **[can set benign parameters for the actions
of others in the region]{.underline}**. (An exclusive reliance on
coercion will, of course, send very different signals.)

### 2NC Turns SCS War

#### Disad turns China rise---alliance breakup makes them hostile

**Ilman, 7-3**---Pacivis (Global Civil Society Research Center) of
University of Indonesia (Zidny, "Is the South China Sea the Stage for
the Next World War?,"
<http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-south-china-sea-the-stage-the-next-world-war-16833?page=show>)

Recent **[skirmishes in the South China Sea]{.underline}** between the
Indonesian navy and China's coast guard **[have reinvigorated public
interest]{.underline}** towards the region. Some applauded Indonesia's
resolve in defending her rightful maritime territory. However, **[some
are still left wondering over China's motives in provoking such regional
conflict]{.underline}**---including with Vietnam, Malaysia and the
Philippines. **[How can one explain why China risks a major war that
could potentially drag the United States in for a bunch of uninhabited
rocks?]{.underline}**

Some say they are fighting for control over major oil and gas reserves
in those seas. But this seems not to be the case. After all, great
powers have rarely fought one another in a major war over economic
resources in modern history, if at all. Or is it because of China's
nine-dash line? For sure, one needs to differentiate the means, ways and
ends of phenomena. The nine-dash line is a means that China uses to
justify its policy ends. But it does not explain the endgame it wants to
achieve---therefore, it cannot be used to explain its motives in the
South China Sea.

Let's take a look back at the twentieth century. World War I started
when Austria-Hungary declared war on and attacked Serbia. So, does it
mean that World War I was caused by Austria-Hungary's invasion? No.
Austria-Hungary did start the war, but it was certainly not caused by
it. The cause of the war was the great powers' concern about the
prevalent regional order in Europe---and their wish to alter it.

The Germans (together with Austria-Hungary) looked uncomfortably at the
shifting balance of power towards the Franco-Russian (and possibly
British) alliance. They saw the erosion of Germany's dominance over the
European order while looking for a way to reverse the trend. The French
and the Russians, boosted by newly gained power, had been humiliated
during the German-led political order before and were also looking for a
way to punish Germany along with her allies.

Similar to World War I, World War II started with an invasion, when
Hitler invaded Poland. However, Poland was not the cause of the
Anglo-French and German rivalry escalating to a war in 1939. Instead,
the Anglo-French were concerned over the shifting balance of power
towards Germany's favor and sought to prevent it from going further in
that direction. That determination finally led to war over Poland's
survival.

Put simply, what Serbia and Poland have in common with the South and
East China Seas is that they served as a venue of great-power rivalry.
But they are definitely not the cause of that rivalry.

To understand the cause of the current U.S.-China rivalry, one needs to
see the history and strategic picture of the Asian region. Put simply,
**[one needs to see beyond the South China Sea]{.underline}**. Following
the defeat of Imperial Japan in World War II, **[the United States has
been the sole great power that can project its power throughout the
region]{.underline}**. Since that day, **[the region has come under
American-led regional order]{.underline}**. Having only a fraction of
the United States' power, other states in the region accepted American
primacy.

What is happening today is that **[China has gathered enough power and
is becoming powerful enough to match (or even surpass) America's ability
to project power throughout much of Asia]{.underline}**. Power means
leadership throughout history and with its newly gained power, **[China
wants a bigger role in regional leadership]{.underline}**. For sure,
though it seems weird for most people, anyone who carefully study
history will concede that this is a normal---though arguably
regrettable---state behavior.

One might point a finger towards Japan and Germany as comparisons---both
of whose rise of power in recent times does not correspond with a
regional crisis that risks regional war---and, therefore, accuse China's
behavior as not normal. However, history once again shows that both
states are the anomaly---not China.

As Singaporean leader Lee Kuan Yew once remarked, "Unlike other emergent
countries, China wants to be China and accepted as such, not as an
honorary member of the West." It is clear from his observation that
**[China has set its sights on displacing the United States as the
dominant power that will dictate the regional order in the Asia
region]{.underline}**. This is not to say that we must agree with or
accept all China wants to do. We may dislike how our rival thinks and
behaves, but we have to understand them. Without understanding how China
thinks, a plausible solution to the current conflict will be hard to
devise.

China's aspiration for greater regional leadership is unfortunately met
with fierce challenges from the United States as well as other regional
great powers such as Japan and India. **[Following the rise of China's
assertiveness, the United States introduced the term
"pivot"]{.underline}** (later rebranded as "rebalancing") **[while her
ally, Japan, has reinterpreted her constitution, allowing Tokyo to be
more active both politically and militarily abroad]{.underline}**.
India, for her part, introduced an eastward-facing policy while trying
to strengthen her maritime power to prevent Chinese incursion into the
Indian Ocean.

Facing the prospect of containment (instead of accommodation), **[the
question of paramount importance for China's leaders is: how can China
displace the United States]{.underline}** (and, therefore, U.S.-led
regional order) **[from Asia?]{.underline}**

**[China seems to believe that the U.S.-led regional order is based on
the U.S.-led political security regional order. This]{.underline}**
political security order in turn **[is based on the U.S. regional
alliance system]{.underline}**, which is known as hub-and-spoke system,
encompassing Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines and
Thailand. **[This alliance system grants the United States access to
forward bases that ensures her ability to rapidly project her power
throughout the region whenever crisis erupts.]{.underline}**

**[Without such bases, the United States won't be able to effectively
project forces and]{.underline}**, therefore, **[will have only marginal
influence in a crisis]{.underline}**. Thus, curtailing the United
States' capability to respond to a regional crisis means much less U.S.
influence upon regional order.

**[So]{.underline}**, as the logic goes, **[breaking this alliance
system will lead to a breakup of the U.S.-led regional order. Thus, the
question]{.underline}** now **[becomes: how can China break up the U.S.
alliance system?]{.underline}**

**[Alliance]{.underline}**, by its nature, **[means an insurant. By
inking an alliance, the United States has assured her allies that she
will help defend them in times of crisis]{.underline}**. Just like a
commercial insurance company, **[the success of the business rests on
the insurer's credibility. As long as U.S. allies believe that
Washington will fulfill her words, the alliance system will hold up.
However, if U.S. allies do not believe her words---thereby doubting the
credibility of her words---the alliance system will
unravel]{.underline}**.

A new question emerges as a consequence: **[how can China damage U.S.
credibility so much that it will lead to the unraveling of its regional
alliance system]{.underline}**? For sure, **[there is no better way to
damage one's credibility than proving that one is unable to fulfill
one's words]{.underline}**. Put it another way, **[China must show U.S.
allies that the United States will not come by their side when they need
her. That means instigating a conflict with U.S. allies, making sure
they will call for U.S. assistance and]{.underline}**, at the same time,
**[making sure that the United States will not fulfill her insurance
policy.]{.underline}**

### Prolif -- Japan -- Will Nuclearize

#### Yes, Japan prolif -- [internal uncertainty]{.underline}, [safeguards don't check]{.underline}

**Burnie, et al, 16**---senior nuclear specialist with Greenpeace
Germany (Shaun, with Frank Barnaby, Nuclear Issues Consultant to the
Oxford Research Group, Tom Clements, can't find quals, Aileen Mioko
Smith, executive director of Green Action, and Kendra Ulrich, Senior
Global Energy Campaigner, Greenpeace Japan, "Nuclear Proliferation in
Plain Sight: Japan's Plutonium Fuel Cycle--A Technical and Economic
Failure But a Strategic Success," The Asia-Pacific Journal \| Japan
Focus Volume 14 \| Issue 5 \| Number 2 \| Mar 2016)

As explained by successive governments and utilities, **[the formal
truth justifying the vast scale of Japan\'s plutonium fuel cycle is that
historically it is driven by energy security considerations, is a
resource poor nation, and that the deployment of fast breeder reactors
and large scale plutonium reprocessing will provide that
security]{.underline}** -- atomic \'tatemae\'. Its latest incarnation,
offered to explain the need for the national government to become more
active in overseeing the nation\'s reprocessing and plutonium MOX
program, has seen the energy security card once again deployed, \"A
nuclear fuel cycle is very important for Japan, which faces a scarcity
of natural resources,\" a senior METI official said in November 2015.152

The reality is that **[Japan\'s plutonium program has nothing to do with
energy security and everything to do with national
security]{.underline}**.

The possession of thousands of kilograms of plutonium capable of being
used to manufacture nuclear weapons clearly also serves Japan\'s
perceived strategic interests but without explicitly having to declare
that this is one of its intended purposes -- plutonium \'honne\'.

Yet, **[much of this proliferation, conducted in plain sight over the
decades, has been there for all to see. Located in a highly unstable
region, with rising tensions, and with enormous uncertainties as to its
future security needs, Japan\'s development of plutonium technologies
and materials serves a future potential military
application]{.underline}**. This was one of the determinants behind the
decisions on the nuclear fuel cycle of the 1950s and 1960s. It gave the
nation a future option -- one that may never have to be realized, but is
there all the same. This also serves its national interest vis a vis its
regional neighbors as well in its security relationship with the United
States.

The ambiguity of what Japan could do with its plutonium stocks, while
remaining an active member state of the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty
(NPT), demonstrates the major flaws in the non-proliferation regime,
where the risks of a nation possessing weapons material is judged on
political allegiance and not on the inherent nature of the nuclear
material. Japan, along with other official non-nuclear weapon states,
insisted on the right to acquire nuclear weapon material for peaceful
use during their negotiation of the terms of the NPT during the late
1960s and their ratification of membership. In the case of Japan it took
until 1975 for ratification, in part due to concerns within Japan\'s
nuclear establishment that plans for reprocessing and the full
development of the nuclear fuel cycle could be curtailed by NPT
membership.153 The last four decades have shown that they should have
had no such concerns.

The Safeguards Myth

In addition to the possession of existing stocks of plutonium, which as
detailed above will increase not decline in the coming years, **[there
is the question of the direct proliferation threat posed by the
operation of the Rokkasho-mura reprocessing plant and J-MOX facility.
The position of the Japanese government and the IAEA is that these
plants will operate under strict international
safeguards]{.underline}**, as required under the NPT and bilateral
safeguards agreements between Japan and the Agency.154 The message from
both parties is that this will ensure that plutonium will be accounted
for with no risk of the material being diverted for non-peaceful
purposes. This is the pretense of Japan\'s nuclear fuel cycle -- added
and abetted by the IAEA -- the \'tatemae\'**[. The reality is that IAEA
safeguards are incapable of meeting their stated aim]{.underline}** --
that is the \'honne\'.

The IAEA confirms that the design throughput of the Rokkasho-mura plant
is 800 tons of spent fuel each year which if completed would yield 8
tons of plutonium, with a storage capacity at the site for 30 tons of
plutonium155 -- or around 4 years of operation. Safeguarding such a
large amount of fissile material in a non-nuclear weapon state has been
a unique challenge for the IAEA156 -- one reason that it has been
working with Japan for more than two decades to design and implement a
safeguards system for Rokkasho-mura.

Unfortunately, **[due to the nature of the reprocessing plant and J-MOX
plant at Rokkasho-mura]{.underline}**, not unique to Japan but the same
for all such \'bulk handling\' facilities, this effort is not capable of
detecting the diversion of significant quantities of plutonium
sufficient to yield multiple nuclear weapons. The IAEA and Japanese
authorities remain silent on this fundamental flaw in nuclear
safeguards. Fortunately, others have been more transparent:

\"No safeguards scheme, including that of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), can be effective if such sensitive materials and
facilities (plutonium and reprocessing plants) are widely available in
Non-Nuclear Weapon States.\" U.S. National Defense Research Institute,
Rand Corporation, November 1993.157

**[The inability of safeguards to be applied to nuclear weapons material
being used in peaceful nuclear programs has been known since the start
of the nuclear age]{.underline}**.158 The particular challenge and
threat from Rokkasho-mura has long been critiqued.159 Still the charade
continues. The end result is that a safeguards system has been developed
for Rokkasho-mura that reportedly absorbs 20 percent of the annual
global safeguards budget of the IAEA. **[All this to create the illusion
that Japan, if it ever was attempted, would be unable to divert
significant quantities of plutonium without the IAEA detecting it. All
for a program that is already awash with a stockpile of weapons
material, and for which there is no current or realistic future
demand.]{.underline}**

Proliferation in Plain Sight

**[Nuclear establishments]{.underline}** (if not politicians)
**[worldwide are aware of the limitations of the IAEA safeguards system.
These establishments include Japan\'s nearest neighbors in East Asia.
Hence, it actually serves Japan\'s strategic interests to create the
public illusion of guaranteed peaceful use for its plutonium, while in
parallel sending a clear signal that it has the means and the material
to use it otherwise]{.underline}**. But just in case nations are not
alert to the potential of Japan, **[successive politicians
have]{.underline}** - over the decades - **[floated the idea that it has
a latent weapons potential]{.underline}**. Most recently, in arguing
against the phase-out of nuclear power following the Fukushima Daiichi
accident, LDP heavyweight and former Defense Minister, Shigeru Ishiba
stated in October of 2011 that \"I don\'t think Japan needs to possess
nuclear weapons, but it\'s important to maintain our commercial reactors
because it would allow us to produce a nuclear warhead in a short amount
of time\".160

**[Yet Japanese leaders' renunciation of nuclear weapons has never been
absolute. In private remarks, many of Japan's prime
ministers]{.underline}** in the 1950s and 1960s **[asserted that the
weapons would enhance their country's national security and
international standing]{.underline}**. (This was partly a mark of the
era, when President Dwight Eisenhower insisted that he saw "no reason
why \[nuclear weapons\] shouldn't be used just exactly as you would use
a bullet or anything else.") After China's first nuclear test in 1964,
Sato informed U.S. President Lyndon Johnson "that if the \[Chinese\] had
nuclear weapons, the Japanese also should have them." He later confided
to the U.S. ambassador to Japan U. Alexis Johnson that the Three
Non-Nuclear Principles were "nonsense." **[Why then did Japan not build
atomic bombs]{.underline}** in the 1960s? Mainly **[because the United
States offered to share its own. Security treaties]{.underline}** signed
in 1952 and 1960 **[granted the U.S. military basing rights in exchange
for protecting Japan]{.underline}**. Those treaties were silent on
nuclear threats, however, so after China's nuclear test, Johnson and his
foreign-policy team devised various schemes to make U.S. atom and
hydrogen bombs available to Japan amid a crisis. In January 1965,
Johnson inaugurated a tradition of American presidents vowing to
Japanese prime ministers, "if Japan needs our nuclear deterrent for its
defense, the United States would stand by its commitments and provide
that defense." **[These reassurances seemed to have their intended
effect]{.underline}**. In 1967, Sato acknowledged the importance of
extended nuclear deterrence in a meeting with Secretary of State Dean
Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara: "The Japanese were
well-protected by the U.S. nuclear umbrella, and Japan had no intention
to make nuclear weapons," he told them. Afterward, Sato announced that
extended nuclear deterrence also formed a pillar of Japan's nuclear
posture. When Sato's former Foreign Minister Takeo Miki became prime
minister in 1974, he convinced the Diet to ratify Japan's acceptance of
the NPT, thanks to President Gerald Ford's reaffirmation that the
U.S.-Japan security treaty encompassed nuclear threats and the
establishment of the Subcommittee on U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation,
where the two countries' foreign and defense ministers would thereafter
meet to coordinate their common defense. **[Optimists claim that nuclear
aversion, political checks, and international commitments will prevent a
Japanese nuclear breakout in the future.]{.underline}** After all,
Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida --- who hails from Hiroshima --- renewed
calls to "accelerate nuclear disarmament" at the NPT Review Conference
this April, inviting world leaders to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
order to "witness with their own eyes the reality of atomic bombings."
**[And yet, Japan is becoming increasingly ambivalent about its military
restraint]{.underline}**. Before his speech in New York, Kishida
finalized new arrangements with the United States that encourage Japan
to function "more proactively" in East Asia. Prime Minister **[Shinzo
Abe is brushing aside widespread public resistance to a Diet resolution
that would authorize the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to operate
overseas]{.underline}** for the first time since World War II. During
his first administration, **[in the wake of the first North Korean
nuclear test in 2006, Abe declared that a limited nuclear arsenal "would
not necessarily violate" the pacifist constitution]{.underline}**. Tokyo
affirmed its non-nuclear status in 2006, but **[with North Korea testing
medium-range ballistic missiles, and China enhancing its conventional
and nuclear forces]{.underline}** amid the contest of wills over the
disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, **[another review seems
inevitable]{.underline}**. In 2011, Shintaro **[Ishihara, the then
powerful governor of Tokyo, even called for Japan to build its own
nuclear arsenal.]{.underline}** A key variable will be how Seoul reacts
to Pyongyang's provocations. South Korea is even more exposed to North
Korean threats, and possesses an advanced civilian nuclear program of
its own. If it took the radical step of nuclearizing, Japan would likely
follow. And if **[Tokyo]{.underline}** invoked North Korea's nuclear
arsenal to withdraw from the NPT, which has a 90-day waiting period, it
could build its own in short order. It **[has a growing defense industry
recently freed from export restrictions, mastery over missile technology
thanks to its space program, and a reprocessing facility capable of
producing enough weapons-useable plutonium to fuel more than 1000 bombs
like the one that leveled Nagasaki]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[if Japan
wanted to, it could probably develop basic explosives in less than a
year and a sophisticated arsenal in three to five years. Faced with an
existential crisis]{.underline}**, however, **[those numbers would
plummet, as Tokyo fast-tracked a national undertaking.]{.underline}**

[With the average age of the hibakusha]{.underline} now [over 80, and
Japanese society gradually leaving its pacifist and anti-nuclear roots
behind]{.underline}, however, [the security alliance with the United
States]{.underline} and the nuclear umbrella that it affords [are
increasingly crucial backstops for Japan's commitments to
nonproliferation]{.underline} and disarmament. [Without them, a nuclear
arms race could ensue in East Asia. If Japan pursued nuclear weapons, it
would upend efforts to restrict their spread]{.underline}, especially
[in East Asia.]{.underline} With the largest nuclear program of any
state outside the 9-member nuclear club, [Japan has long been a poster
child for nonproliferation.]{.underline} Besides its NPT membership, it
accepts the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency --- the
global nuclear watchdog --- on activities ranging from uranium imports
to plutonium reprocessing. In 1998, it was the first to sign up for the
IAEA's voluntary Additional Protocol, which mandated even more
comprehensive and onerous inspections after the first Gulf War. The
Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs touts nuclear disarmament, and
officials of its Arms Control and Disarmament Division toil abroad in
support of international efforts to manage and eventually eliminate
weapons of mass destruction. [These attitudes]{.underline} and behaviors
[are often ascribed to the bombs' enduring impact on Japanese culture
and politics.]{.underline} An estimated 66,000 people were killed and
69,000 injured in Hiroshima, and another 39,000 and 25,000 in Nagasaki
--- in all, 250,000 to 300,000 died within 13 years. During the 7-year
U.S. occupation of Japan, U.S. authorities censored accounts of the
bombings and its radioactive aftereffects on the cities' populations.
Anti-nuclear sentiment flared again after an American H-bomb test went
awry in 1954, contaminating 7000 square miles of the South Pacific and
irradiating 23 crew members of a Japanese fishing vessel --- the Lucky
Dragon --- one of whom later died from radiation poisoning. The incident
gave rise to public outcry and anti-nuclear protests in Japan and was
featured in the godfather of all monster movies --- Godzilla. One year
later, Japan's parliament, the Diet, restricted domestic nuclear
activities to those with civilian uses, a norm which Prime Minister
Eisaku Sato further reinforced in 1967, when he introduced his Three
Non-Nuclear Principles: non-possession, non-manufacture, and
non-introduction of nuclear weapons. [Yet Japanese leaders' renunciation
of nuclear weapons has never been absolute. In private remarks, many of
Japan's prime ministers]{.underline} in the 1950s and 1960s [asserted

\[nuclear weapons\] shouldn't be used just exactly as you would use a
bullet or anything else.") [After China's first nuclear test in 1964,
Sato]{.underline} informed U.S. President Lyndon Johnson "that if the
\[Chinese\] had nuclear weapons, the Japanese also should have them." He
later [confided to the U.S. ambassador]{.underline} to Japan U. Alexis
Johnson [that the Three Non-Nuclear Principles were
"nonsense."]{.underline} Why then did Japan not build atomic bombs in
the 1960s? Mainly because the United States offered to share its own.
Security treaties signed in 1952 and 1960 granted the U.S. military
basing rights in exchange for protecting Japan. Those treaties were
silent on nuclear threats, however, so after China's nuclear test,
Johnson and his foreign-policy team devised various schemes to make U.S.
atom and hydrogen bombs available to Japan amid a crisis. In January
1965, Johnson inaugurated a tradition of American presidents vowing to
Japanese prime ministers, "if Japan needs our nuclear deterrent for its
defense, the United States would stand by its commitments and provide
that defense." These reassurances seemed to have their intended effect.
In 1967, Sato acknowledged the importance of extended nuclear deterrence
in a meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara: "The Japanese were well-protected by the U.S. nuclear
umbrella, and Japan had no intention to make nuclear weapons," he told
them. Afterward, Sato announced that extended nuclear deterrence also
formed a pillar of Japan's nuclear posture. When Sato's former Foreign
Minister Takeo Miki became prime minister in 1974, he convinced the Diet
to ratify Japan's acceptance of the NPT, thanks to President Gerald
Ford's reaffirmation that the U.S.-Japan security treaty encompassed
nuclear threats and the establishment of the Subcommittee on U.S.-Japan
Defense Cooperation, where the two countries' foreign and defense
ministers would thereafter meet to coordinate their common defense.
[Optimists claim that nuclear aversion, political checks, and
international commitments will prevent a Japanese nuclear breakout in
the future.]{.underline} After all, Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida ---
who hails from Hiroshima --- renewed calls to "accelerate nuclear
disarmament" at the NPT Review Conference this April, inviting world
leaders to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki in order to "witness with their
own eyes the reality of atomic bombings." [And yet, Japan is becoming
increasingly ambivalent about its military restraint.]{.underline}
Before his speech in New York, Kishida finalized new arrangements with
the United States that encourage Japan to function "more proactively" in
East Asia. Prime Minister Shinzo [Abe is brushing aside widespread
public resistance to a Diet resolution that would authorize the Japanese
Self-Defense Forces to operate overseas]{.underline} for the first time
since World War II. During his first administration, in the wake of the
first North Korean nuclear test [in 2006, Abe declared that a limited
nuclear arsenal "would not necessarily violate" the pacifist
constitution.]{.underline} Tokyo affirmed its non-nuclear status in
2006, but [with North Korea testing medium-range ballistic missiles, and
China enhancing its conventional and nuclear forces amid the
contest]{.underline} of wills [over]{.underline} the disputed
[Senkaku]{.underline}/Diaoyu Islands, [another review seems inevitable.
In 2011, Shintaro Ishihara, the then powerful governor of Tokyo, even
called for Japan to build its own nuclear arsenal.]{.underline} A key
variable will be how Seoul reacts to Pyongyang's provocations. South
Korea is even more exposed to North Korean threats, and possesses an
advanced civilian nuclear program of its own. If it took the radical
step of nuclearizing, Japan would likely follow. And [if Tokyo invoked
North Korea's nuclear arsenal to withdraw from the NPT]{.underline},
which has a 90-day waiting period, [it could build its own in short
order. It has a growing defense industry recently freed from export
restrictions, mastery over missile technology thanks to its space
program, and a reprocessing facility capable of producing enough
weapons-useable plutonium to fuel more than 1000 bombs]{.underline} like
the one that leveled Nagasaki. Indeed, [if Japan wanted to, it could
probably develop basic explosives in less than a year and a
sophisticated arsenal in three to five years. Faced with an existential
crisis]{.underline}, however, [those numbers would plummet, as Tokyo
fast-tracked a national undertaking.]{.underline} For all of these
reasons, Washington needs Tokyo to play a more active role in regional
security. The bilateral Extended Deterrence Dialogue formalized
mid-level consultations in 2010; the meetings should expand to include
South Korea --- trilateral coordination is overdue. The United States
should continue urging Japan to invest more on conventional forces. For
decades, Japanese military spending has hovered around 1 percent of
gross domestic product. Even a half-percent increase would help offset
smaller U.S. defense budgets, reducing scenarios where U.S. nuclear
forces would have to be called on and increasing the credibility of U.S.
deterrent threats in East Asia as a result. [Hibakusha have educated
Japan and humanity about the lifelong harm that nuclear weapons can
inflict. Their advancing age is representative of the generational
changes facing Japan]{.underline}, however, [with profound implications
for its foreign policies. As Japan assumes a more active security role
in East Asia, it may be tempted to rethink its nuclear
options.]{.underline} With some experts promoting "tailored"
proliferation to U.S. allies to counter China's rise, [U.S.-Japanese
efforts to reduce nuclear risks regionally and worldwide appear
increasingly in jeopardy.]{.underline} The shadow of American power
still looms over Japan 70 years after two artificial suns rose over
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The nuclear partnership with Washington has
afforded Tokyo the security necessary to renounce nuclear weapons and
champion a world without them. [With Japan's nuclear restraint no longer
the article of faith it once was, the significance of]{.underline} the
nuclear [pacts struck decades ago will become ever more
consequential.]{.underline}

That decision followed a formal, secret study of options for building
nuclear arms, conducted in 1970 at the behest of Yasuhiro Nakasone, then
Japan's defense minister. After two years of work, the group concluded
\"it would be possible in a legal sense to possess small-yield,
tactical, purely defensive nuclear weapons without violating the
constitution.\" But it decided that the effort would be costly, take
years, and alienate Japan's neighbors. The country decided instead to
stay under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. But **[many prominent Japanese

Outside of the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent, **[Japan maintains one
of the world's largest atomic energy programs,]{.underline}** considered
by many to be a strategic hedge. Prior to the 2011 Fukishima disaster,
Japan received around 30 percent of its electricity from nuclear power.
While Japan has idled its reactors in response to Fukishima, it hopes to
maintain a robust nuclear energy program. In contrast to most other
non-nuclear weapon states with large nuclear energy programs, **[Japan
has both uranium enrichment and reprocessing capabilities, as well as
vast stocks of separated reactor-grade plutonium that could be used in
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**.16 **[Right-wing Japanese officials have
referred to the large stocks of weapons-usable plutonium as a
deterrent]{.underline}**, and some states, including South Korea and
China, have expressed concern that Japan is allowed to possess
weapons-usable materials. Japan maintains policy restrictions on nuclear
energy. Japan's 1955 Atomic Basic Energy Law states that "The research,
development, and utilization of nuclear energy shall be limited to
peaceful purposes, shall aim at ensuring safety, and shall be performed
independently under democratic administration, and the results obtained
shall be made public so as to actively contribute to international
cooperation."17 **[In 2012, this article was amended to add "national
security" as a justification for preserving a civil nuclear energy
program.]{.underline}** Responses to the amendment are varied. Some
Japanese officials argue that the addition of "national security" does
not conflict with the commitment to only pursue nuclear energy for
peaceful reasons. Others are more skeptical, claiming that this change
directly conflicts with the constitution.18 **[If Japan were to decide
to pursue an indigenous nuclear weapons capability, some estimates
suggest that it could create a nuclear weapon in two
years]{.underline}**.19 Given this, Japan's nuclear energy program is
considered by some to be a hedge against potential security threats.
This hedge is supplemented by Japan's investment in space-launch
vehicles (SLVs), including the H-11 and Epilson-1, which were developed
for Japan's civil space program.20 **[The technology of SLVs is very
similar to that of ballistic missiles, and SLVs could be modified to
deliver nuclear weapons.]{.underline}**

NUCLEAR-ARMED JAPAN INCONCEIVABLE?,"
<http://warontherocks.com/2016/06/is-a-nuclear-armed-japan-inconceivable/>)

**[The distaste for having their own nuclear deterrent coupled with
being in a dangerous neighborhood has required that Japan turn
to]{.underline}** other countries, like **[the United States, for
security. It is here, in the U.S.-Japanese alliance, "the cornerstone of
Japan's diplomacy"]{.underline}**, according to Shinzo Abe, **[that we
find the rest of the explanation]{.underline}**.

For the past 70 years, since the introduction of nuclear weapons, it is
the policy of the United States to counter proliferation and curb the
expansion of the nuclear club. **[The United States has been very
successful in providing hefty incentives to states that stop their
exploration or pursuit of nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. One of these
inducements, an extended nuclear deterrent, obliges the United States to
provide defense and security to allies in the event of an attack or
conflict. **[Rather than disregarding domestic public opinion and
risking punishment in the international community, Japan can rely on
America's nuclear arsenal.]{.underline}**

**[This is how the United States has been able to use its protection to
constrain risky behavior among its allies]{.underline}**. Research in
political science would suggest that these types of alliances may entrap
and force the United States to get involved when allies take unnecessary
risks to get their way. Neil Narang and I show in a recent working
paper, however, that nuclear umbrellas can positively shape ally
behavior. We find that protected allies, like Japan, are not any more
likely to engage in risky business and instead use the alliance to reap
political and economic gains.

**[This is not to say that Japan has no bargaining power of its own.
Japan maintains one of the highest latent nuclear capacities in the
world. Experts argue that if Japan were to desire nuclear weapons its
"break out" time would be short]{.underline}**. But **[it's this
capability that provides Japan with leverage]{.underline}**. In a new
working paper, Gene Gerzhoy, Rachel Whitlark, and I find that this
capability doesn't necessarily embolden countries. Instead, **[they use
it, short of opting to get nuclear weapons, to settle disputes, gain
concessions, and side-step external aggression.]{.underline}**

### AT: Japan Lacks Plutonium

#### Japan has a huge stockpile of plutonium- when they want to they can have tons of nukes

**Lewis 14**---Jeffrey Lewis is director of the East Asia
Nonproliferation Program for the James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International
Studies at Monterey, 2014 ("Japan Has Enough Plutonium to Make Thousands
of Nukes", December 1, 2014,
<http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/12/01/japan-has-enough-plutonium-to-make-thousands-of-nukes/>)

Japan's plutonium stockpile is a constant topic of discussion**[. Japan
is the only non-nuclear weapons state that sits on tons of separated
plutonium]{.underline}**, **[which could be used to make nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. Japan's neighbors never tire of pointing out
Tokyo's stockpile of plutonium in the same breath as the empire's
wartime past. I doubt much of this carping is sincere, **[but Japan's
plutonium policies do create nonproliferation problems.]{.underline}**
Although I don't believe Japan would use its civil plutonium in a bomb
program, **[the stockpile]{.underline}** --- and Tokyo's repeated
comments about the importance of reprocessing for energy security ---
**[makes it much harder to convince countries with worse
nonproliferation records]{.underline}** (from Iran to South Korea) **[to
restrain themselves]{.underline}**. The Abe government should take
advantage of the delay in operations at Rokkasho to think about setting
a better example. Japan's long-standing emphasis on nuclear energy
reflects a national neuralgia about energy security. Japan has few
traditional energy sources on its home islands. After all, Japan's
attack on Pearl Harbor was a prelude to the seizure of the Dutch East
Indies oil resources that Tokyo believed were essential to continue the
war. Post-war Japan has been peaceful, but no less mindful of energy
security issues. **[Today, Japan maintains the world's second-largest
petroleum reserve after Uncle Sam.]{.underline}** And, more importantly,
**[Japan has invested heavily in nuclear energy.]{.underline}** **[Since
Japan has no uranium, it spent vast sums to develop the infrastructure
to recover and reuse plutonium from spent fuel.]{.underline}** The
massive \$30 billion Rokkasho plant --- where Japan will separate
plutonium from spent fuel --- is the centerpiece of this effort. Despite
massive investments, however, Japan has never been able to develop the
companion technology: a fast reactor that will consume the plutonium.
Japan's fast reactor at Monju --- like others attempted in the United
States, France, and elsewhere --- is so hot it is cooled by molten
sodium. Molten sodium explodes on contact with water. Guess how well
that works out? Sodium-related nuclear accidents occurred in the United
States in 1959 and again in 1964, the latter giving us the Reader's
Digest book, We Almost Lost Detroit. (We also got a great Gil Scott
Heron song out of it, which has been sampled a couple of times.) Monju
itself experienced a serious accident in 1995; regulators recently
discovered it sits on a fault line. Japanese authorities are now
considering pulling the plug on Monju. Without it, Japan will have to
mix the plutonium with uranium in something called mixed oxide fuel(MOX)
that can be used in existing reactors after a bit of conversion. The
problem is that Japan has not yet completed the MOX plant at Rokkasho
and only a small number of Japanese nuclear power plants were converted
before the Fukushima accident. Like the rest of Japan's nuclear power
plants, these are not operating. That means that once Japan begins
operating Rokkasho, there is no place for the plutonium to go**[. Its
stockpile of plutonium will grow. And grow. And grow. Japan has more
than 10 tons of separated plutonium --- enough for thousands of nuclear
warheads. And don't let anyone tell you that plutonium produced in a
commercial reactor can't be used in a nuclear weapon. The United States
did it in 1962]{.underline}**. Here is the definitive statement on the
matter from the U.S. Department of Energy: \"**[a potential
proliferating state could build a nuclear weapon from reactor grade
plutonium that would have an assured, reliable yield of one or a few
kilotons]{.underline}** (and a probable **[yield significantly higher
than that]{.underline}**).\" One kiloton is wimpy by modern standards,
but it will still \"suck the paint off your house and give your family a
permanent orange Afro.\" Despite having nowhere for the plutonium to go,
Japan has invested an enormous amount of money in Rokkasho. The local
community in Aomori prefecture accepted the storage of Japan's spent
nuclear fuel based on the expectation that the spent fuel would be
separated and the waste shipped elsewhere for long-term disposal. But
there is no repository at the moment. Japan's energy policy is screwed
up, but things are usually screwed up for a reason. Tokyo started down
this path in the 1970s when reprocessing was all the rage. (People had a
lot of terrible ideas in the 1970s. Look how angry it made Mike Watt.) I
understand how hard it would be for Japan to walk away from a \$30
billion investment with no clear plan to store and dispose of the spent
fuel.

**[China's growing]{.underline}** power and **[assertiveness will

different than those of the Cold War---**[and changes in its strategic
landscape. One of them will result from the slow change in

which for a generation following World War II could count comfortably on
America's capacity to defend it against all major powers. Any dramatic
changes in Tokyo's national-security strategy spurred by China's rise
will perforce spark controversy and encounter resistance within Japan.
Prime Minister Shinzo **[Abe has pushed through legislation that permits
Japan to participate in collective self-defense in its
neighborhood]{.underline}** (in particular, defending American forces
that come under attack) **[and perhaps beyond.]{.underline}**

**[In 2014, Tokyo ended the ban on military exports]{.underline}**,
which originated in 1967. **[In February 2016, Japan and the Philippines
signed a defense-cooperation agreement]{.underline}**. The lease by the
Philippines of Japanese TC-90 maritime surveillance aircraft represented
the first step in arms sales.

**[Japan has also deepened its ties with Vietnam, which, too, looks
askance at China]{.underline}** and has been embroiled with Beijing on
disputes over the South China Sea. Since the early 1990s, Japan has
expanded trade with Vietnam and increased its economic aid. The two
states signed a security-cooperation accord in 2006, which was upgraded
in 2014 to an "Extensive Strategic Partnership," and commenced annual
defense consultations in 2011. In 2016, Japan decided to supply Hanoi
with used maritime patrol vessels. Vietnam, in turn, agreed to allow
ships from Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (the euphemism for its
navy) to make port calls at Cam Ranh Bay.

**[These]{.underline}** and other **[steps have]{.underline}** already
**[provoked opposition from Japan's political class]{.underline}** and
citizenry. **[The crux is whether domestic opposition will be trumped by
national-security exigencies created by the shift in the U.S.-China
balance of power]{.underline}**. Japan's changing defense policy has
already produced disquiet in certain regional capitals, particularly
Beijing and Seoul. Tokyo will have to strike a balance between ensuring
adequate deterrence against its adversaries, on the one hand, and
reassuring its neighbors and building the domestic consensus required to
beef up its military capacity, on the other.

**[The proposition that Japan's defense posture and national-security
strategy will remain frozen in place because of]{.underline}** the
potency of **[post--World War II pacifism amounts to
oversimplification]{.underline}**. **[Dramatic defense-policy changes
have occurred repeatedly]{.underline}** since the Tokugawa era, **[with
external challenges playing a major role in initiating

### AT: Japan Constitution

#### Japan Constitution allows for the development of nukes- even if it isn't Abe doesn't care

**Ryall 16**--- Julian Ryall is a writer for South China Morning Post,
2016 ("Shinzo Abe's government insists Japanese constitution does not
explicitly prohibit nuclear weapons", April 4^th^, Accessed 6/24/16,

**[The government of Shinzo Abe has stated that there is nothing in the
nation's Constitution that explicitly forbids Japan from possessing or
using nuclear weapons.]{.underline}** The government's position on the
issue was made clear in a written response to a question posed by two
opposition politicians in the Diet on Friday. And although the present
government interprets Article 9 of the war-renouncing Constitution as
not banning Japan from having a nuclear deterrent, it emphasised in the
written response that the government "firmly maintains a policy
principle that it does not possess nuclear weapons of any type under the
three non-nuclear principles". I would assume this has come as something
of a surprise to the Japanese public **[Analysts point out that Abe's
reading of the Constitution is actually consistent with the previous
government's interpretation]{.underline}**, although the revelation has
caused headlines in some left-of-centre newspapers and surprise among
the majority of the public. In a statement in the Diet in 1978, Prime
Minister Takeo Fukuda said **[Article 9 does not "absolutely prohibit"
Japan from having nuclear weapons, as long as they are "limited to the
minimum necessary level"]{.underline}**, the Asahi newspaper reported.
That comment had largely been forgotten until Yusuke Yokobatake, the
director general of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, stated at a meeting
of the Upper House Budget Committee on March 18 that the Constitution
does not ban Japan from using nuclear weapons. That comment was seized
upon by the opposition and led to questions to the prime minister. **["I
would assume this has come as something of a surprise to the Japanese
p]{.underline}**ublic," said Jun Okumura, a visiting scholar at the
Meiji Institute for Global Affairs. "I was dimly aware in my youth that
there had been serious talks about Japan having nuclear weapons, under
the administration of Eisaku Sato in the late 1960s and early '70s.
Donald Trump has raised the prospect of a nuclear-armed Japan. "**[But
that was at the time of the cold war and nuclear weapons were being
considered by several nations in the region, including Taiwan and South
Korea.]{.underline}** "It was not until much more recently -- perhaps
the last decade or so -- that I learned that the right to have nuclear
weapons is actually Japan's accepted doctrine." **[The government's
tacit position, now made clear, may cause renewed concerns among
neighbouring countries already watching Abe's administration warily, as
well as a proportion of the Japanese public.]{.underline}** It was only
in 2014, for example, that an estimated 10,000 demonstrators gathered
outside the prime minister's official residence in Tokyo to protest
Abe's interpretation of the Constitution to mean that Japanese troops
are permitted to go to the assistance of forces of allied nations in the
event of a military incident. In addition, **[the new reading of the
Constitution allows Tokyo to send troops to combat zones to assist in
military operations. Abe had stated previously that he is keen for Japan
to play a more proactive role that is more commensurate with its
economic power in international peacekeeping operations and in other
security hot spots.]{.underline}** The government's comments coincide
with statements by Donald Trump, the front runner for the Republican
Party's nomination for this year's US elections. Over the weekend, Trump
reiterated his belief that the US should reduce its military presence
overseas and, to pick up the security slack, Japan and South Korea
should develop and deploy nuclear weapons. "I would rather have them not
armed but I'm not going to continue to lose this tremendous amount of
money," Trump told supporters during a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday.
"And frankly, the case could be made that \... let them protect
themselves against North Korea. They would probably wipe them out pretty
quick. "Good luck, folks. Enjoy yourselves. If they fight, that would be
terrible, right? But if they do, they do."

TOKYO --- **[Japan's ruling coalition was a clear winner]{.underline}**
in Sunday's parliamentary elections, preliminary results and Japanese
media exit polls indicated[, **paving the way for Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe to push ahead**]{.underline} with his economic revival policies, but
also possibly **[changing the nation's postwar pacifist
constitution.]{.underline}** Half of the seats of the less powerful
upper house were up for grabs. There had been no possibility for a
change of power because the ruling coalition, headed by Abe's Liberal
Democratic Party, already controls the more powerful lower house, but
the balloting was a key gauge of how much support Abe's coalition has
among the public. The opposition had called on voters to show their
rejection of Abe's position to have a more assertive military role for
Japan. According to the exit polls, the Liberal Democrats won 57 to 59
seats among the 121 that were contested. Its coalition partner Komeito
won about 14 seats. Combined with other conservative politicians, the
coalition may win a two-thirds majority in the upper house, which would
be critical to propose a referendum needed to change the constitution.
Japanese broadcaster NHK reported that the Liberal Democrats may clinch
the majority on their own. Final results of the balloting aren't
expected until early Monday. Abe showed up before TV cameras at party
headquarters, all smiles, to pin red flowers, indicating confirmed wins,
next to his candidates' names written on a big board. "I am honestly so
relieved," he told NHK, promising new government spending to help wrest
the economy out of the doldrums in a "total and aggressive" way. He
declined to give the amount for the spending. He also said discussions
should start on changing the constitution to work out details. With
their pro-business policies, the Liberal Democrats have ruled Japan
almost continuously since World War II, and until recently enjoyed solid
support from rural areas. The few years the opposition held power
coincided with the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disasters that
devastated northeastern Japan. The opposition, however, fell out of
favor after being heavily criticized for its reconstruction efforts.
Robert Dujarric**[, professor and director of the Institute of
Contemporary Asian Studies at Temple University Japan in Tokyo, said the
win reflected voters']{.underline}** disenchantment with the opposition,
rather than their [**excitement about Abe's policies.**]{.underline}
"The public is old. It doesn't want change," he said. "It doesn't want
what Japan really needs --- more structural reform, less money for the
old and more funding for families and children." The Japanese
constitution, written by the United States after Japan's defeat in World
War II, limits its military to a self-defense role, although Japan has a

their work will be limited to disaster relief. But some **[Japanese

election since Japan lowered the voting age from 20 to 18, potentially
adding 2.4 million voters. Although "manga" animation and other events
were used to woo young voters, results from early and absentee voting
pointed to a low turnout, highlighting how many young Japanese are
disillusioned with mainstream politics[. **Masses of people have come

although he has made clear that he is eager to restart reactors that
were idled after the nuclear disaster, the worst since Chernobyl, and
make atomic energy a Japanese export. Abe had repeatedly stressed during
his campaign that his "Abenomics" program, centered on easy lending and
a cheap yen to encourage exports, is still unfinished, and that patience
is needed for results. "I voted hoping the economy of the country gets

showed an opposition in shambles. He said some members of the opposition
may defect to the ruling coalition, as some agree with Abe's views. The
opposition leadership will likely have to resign to take responsibility
for the election defeat, as their platform failed to appeal to the
public, he said. Even so, Abe won't rush to change the constitution,
hoping for better timing because the recent strengthening of the yen, a
minus for exports, and concerns about global growth are weighing on the
economy, according to Kato. Yukio Edano, the legislator who ran the
campaign for the main opposition Democratic Party, acknowledged that

regular people. "But people felt we did not offer enough of an

### AT: Prolif ≠ War

#### Yes it does---uniquely true for Asia

**[Failure to contain proliferation]{.underline}** in Pyongyang **[could
spread nuclear fever throughout Asia. Japan and South Korea might seek
nuclear weapons and missile defenses.]{.underline}** **[A pentagonal
configuration of nuclear powers in the Pacific basin]{.underline}**
(Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, and North Korea -- not including the
United States, with its own Pacific interests) **[could put deterrence
at risk and create enormous temptation toward nuclear
preemption]{.underline}**. Apart from actual use or threat of use, North
Korea could exploit the mere existence of an assumed nuclear capability
in order to support its coercive diplomacy.19 In Paul Bracken's terms,
North Korea can use its nuclear weapons to support either a "strategy of
extreme provocation" or one intended to "keep the nuclear pot boiling"
without having crossed the threshold of nuclear first use.20 In October
2013 there were reports of the DPRK renewing nuclear activities, and
perhaps preparing for new nuclear tests.

A **[five-sided nuclear competition in the Pacific would be linked, in
geopolitical deterrence and proliferation space, to the existing nuclear
deterrents of India and Pakistan, and to the emerging nuclear weapons
status of Iran. An arc of nuclear instability from Tehran to Tokyo could
place US proliferation strategies into the ash heap of
history]{.underline}** and call for more drastic military options, not
excluding preemptive war, defenses, and counter-deterrent special
operations. In addition, **[an unrestricted nuclear arms race in Asia
would most likely increase the chance of accidental or inadvertent
nuclear war. It would do so because]{.underline}**: (a) **[some states
in the region already have histories of protracted
conflict]{.underline}**; (b) **[states may have politically unreliable
or immature command and control systems, especially during a crisis
involving a decision for nuclear first strike or
retaliation]{.underline}**; (c) **[unreliable or immature systems might
permit a technical malfunction resulting in an unintended
launch,]{.underline}** or a deliberate but unauthorized launch, by rogue
commanders; (d) **[faulty intelligence and warning systems might cause
one side to misinterpret the other's defensive moves to forestall attack
as offensive preparations for attack, thus triggering a mistaken
preemption.]{.underline}**

#### Prolif outweighs---multipolar dynamics make every impact more likely

**Kleiner, 6-3**---postdoctoral fellow at Yale Law School (Sam, "With
His Finger on the Trigger,"

**[A new nuclear-arms race]{.underline}**, moreover, **[could be even
riskier]{.underline}** than the one Reagan and others worked so hard to
end. In retrospect, **[the Cold War standoff between two massive,
nuclear-armed superpowers offered some stability]{.underline}**; among
other things, **[the fact that the United States and the Soviet Union
could destroy each other, or any other challenger, in a nuclear
confrontation ended up preventing either side from using nuclear
weapons. Global alliances were structured in a bipolar
system]{.underline}**, with smaller powers picking one side or the
other, **[which meant fewer possible avenues for
conflict]{.underline}**.

But that world came to an end when the Cold War finished. **[We now live
in a multipolar world that is]{.underline}**, in many ways, **[a more
dangerous one]{.underline}**. Former Secretaries of State Kissinger and
George Shultz, former Secretary of Defense William Perry, and Senator
Sam Nunn warned in 2011 that "**[the growing number of nations with
nuclear arms and differing motives, aims and ambitions poses very high
and unpredictable risks and increased instability." One particularly
risky and region right now is East Asia, where competing territorial
claims and an unpredictable North Korea threaten to flare into conflict.
If Japan, which is revising its pacifist]{.underline}** post-World War
II **[foreign policy toward a more assertive one, or South Korea, where
there is broad popular support for weaponization, go nuclear, the
chances grow for a regional arms race---and for nuclear
war]{.underline}**.

One possibility, as Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies noted: "**[North Korea might be tempted to launch a
preemptive attack at a time when the U.S. defense commitment \[to South
Korea\] might no longer apply]{.underline}**." But even "short of this
worst-case scenario, rather than negotiate disarmament, North Korea more
likely would claim the South's actions as a justification for stepping
up its own nuclear program."

**[These are by no means the only risks. There is]{.underline}**, for
example, **[the risk of an accidental firing or a rogue officer deciding
that he or she wants to launch a nuclear weapon. There is the risk of
"loose nukes" falling into the wrong hands, and the risk that individual
scientists will be willing to transfer nuclear technology to the highest
bidder]{.underline}**, as Pakistan's A.Q. Khan did in selling nuclear
technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea.

When the nuclear bomb was first being developed, Secretary of War Henry
Stimson offered a poignant warning about how devastating the weapon
would be. He told President Henry Truman that "**[such a weapon may be
constructed in secret and used suddenly and effectively with devastating
power by a willful nation or group against an unsuspecting nation or
group of much greater size and material power]{.underline}**." Today,
**[America's "greater size and material power" can't necessarily stop a
nuclear strike, particularly if the materials fall into the hands of
terrorists.]{.underline}**
