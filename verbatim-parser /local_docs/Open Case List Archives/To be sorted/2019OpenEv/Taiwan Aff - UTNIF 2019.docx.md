#### The United States federal government should substantially reduce its arms sales to the Republic of China.

### 1AC -- Inherency

#### The United States sells arms to Taiwan to fulfill its security commitments. This policy threatens conflict with China and undermines United States credibility.

**[The U.S. security commitment to Taiwan consists of two pillars
established in the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979: arms sales and an
implicit promise to defend Taiwan with military force should it be
attacked.]{.underline}** Both are set forth in Section 3 of the TRA,
which states, in part, that the United States is permitted to sell
Taiwan "defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be
necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability."14 Comparatively, the implicit commitment to use force to
defend Taiwan is less clear. Section 3, part 3, authorizes the president
and Congress to "determine, in accordance with constitutional processes,
appropriate action by the United States" in response to "any threat to
the security or the social or economic system of the people on Taiwan
and any danger to the interests of the United States arising
therefrom."15 Military force is not explicitly mentioned, but it falls
within the category of appropriate action that the United States could
take.

**[The imprecise wording of the TRA has served the United States well by
creating "strategic ambiguity," the underpinning of dual
deterrence.]{.underline}**16 Strategic ambiguity, the open question of
whether or not the U.S. military would intervene in a cross-strait
conflict, had two important effects. First, it gave the United States
greater freedom of action in trilateral relations. By not binding itself
to one particular position, the United States could better adapt to
unpredictable events. Second, strategic ambiguity restricted China and
Taiwan's freedom of action. Upsetting the status quo carried high costs
for both sides. The United States could warn Taiwan that no cavalry
would come to the rescue if Taiwan provoked China by making moves toward
de jure independence.17 Likewise, the high costs that would be inflicted
on the PLA by a U.S. intervention prevented Beijing from initiating a
conflict.

**[China's growing military power has diminished the value of strategic
ambiguity by improving Beijing's ability to inflict high costs on an
intervening American force. The mere possibility of American
intervention may no longer be enough to deter China]{.underline}** if
the PLA is better prepared to mitigate the effects.

**[Further complicating the U.S.-Taiwan defense relationship is the slow
but steady erosion of U.S. credibility over the last two
decades.]{.underline}** This analysis uses the "Current Calculus" theory
set forth by Dartmouth professor Daryl G. Press as the basis for
assessing U.S. credibility. Press states, "Decisionmakers assess the
credibility of their adversaries' threats by evaluating the balance of
power and interests ... **[Future commitments will be
credible]{.underline}** if---and **[only if]{.underline}**---they are
backed up by sufficient strength and **[connected to weighty
interests.]{.underline}**"18 From Beijing's perspective, the U.S.
commitment to defend Taiwan is credible if American military power can
pose a threat to Chinese forces and the United States has a strong
interest in defending Taiwan.

On the subject of interests, Taiwan carries much more importance for
China than it does for the United States. Charles Glaser of George
Washington University writes "**[China considers Taiwan a core
interest---an essential part of its homeland that it is determined to
bring under full sovereign control.]{.underline}**"19 Beijing does not
appear eager to reunite Taiwan with the mainland by force in the near
future, but China's president Xi Jinping has warned that "political
disagreements that exist between the two sides . . . cannot be passed on
from generation to generation."20 **[Maintaining Taiwan's de facto
independence]{.underline}** may be important **[for the
U.S]{.underline}**. position in East Asia, but it **[does not carry the
same significance that China places on reunification.]{.underline}**21

**[Since China enjoys an advantage in the balance of interests, the
credibility of the U.S. commitment rests on American military
power.]{.underline}** According to Press's model, if the United States
can carry out its threat to intervene with relatively low costs, then
the threat is credible.22 **[When the TRA was passed in 1979, the United
States enjoyed a clear advantage over a militarily weak China. That is
no longer the case.]{.underline}** Several recently published
assessments of a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan have sobering
conclusions: **[America's lead is shrinking, victory is less certain,
and the damage inflicted on the U.S. military would be
substantial.]{.underline}** In China's Military Power, Roger Cliff of
the Atlantic Council writes, "Although China's leadership could not be
confident that an invasion of Taiwan in 2020 would succeed, it is
nonetheless possible that it could succeed... . Even a failed attempt,
moreover, would likely be extremely costly to the United States and
Taiwan."23 The RAND Corporation reached a similar conclusion: "At a
minimum, the U.S. military would have to mount a substantial
effort---certainly much more so than in 1996---if it hoped to prevail,
and losses to U.S. forces would likely be heavy."24 It is impossible to
determine exactly how many American ships, aircraft, and lives would be
lost to defend Taiwan from a PLA attack. But **[given the improved
quality of PLA weapons systems and training exercises, it is safe to
assume that the U.S. military would have to cope with losses that it has
not experienced in decades.]{.underline}**

Of course, it is important to note that high costs do not flow one way.
In a war, the United States and Taiwan would make an invasion very
costly for China, which reduces the credibility of Beijing's threats to
use force. However, **[U.S. military superiority in a Taiwan Strait
conflict was nearly absolute until very recently. This superiority made
victory relatively cheap, which enhanced the credibility of the American
commitment]{.underline}**.25 **[Improvements to already formidable
Chinese weapons systems, combined with recent reforms that enhance
command and control for fighting modern war, continue to ratchet up the
costs the United States would have to absorb.]{.underline}**26

If the PLA continues to improve at the rate it has done over the last 20
years, the United States could be in the unpleasant position of fighting
a very costly conflict over a piece of territory that China has a much
stronger interest in controlling than the United States has in keeping
independent. Close economic ties between the United States and China
(bilateral trade in goods was valued at \$598 billion in 2015 in nominal
dollars) would likely suffer as well.27 **[The high costs the United
States would face in a conflict over Taiwan undermine U.S. credibility.
China's stronger interests and ability to inflict high costs on the
United States could encourage Beijing to take risks that until recently
would have been considered unacceptable.]{.underline}**

### 1AC -- US China War Advantage

#### New arms sales proposals signal the end of strategic ambiguity -- signals containment

**Lee** 4-3-**19** -- Professor John Lee is a senior fellow at the
Hudson Institute in Washington DC and United States Studies Center in
Sydney. From 2016-18, he was the national security adviser to the
Australian foreign minister. ("Why a US Sale of Fighter Jets to Taiwan
Matters,"
https://thediplomat.com/2019/04/why-a-us-sale-of-fighter-jets-to-taiwan-matters/)
bhb

In late March, Bloomberg reported that U.S. President Donald **[Trump's
advisers]{.underline}** had **[encouraged Taiwan to submit a formal
request to buy up to 60 advanced F-16V fighter planes]{.underline}**.
Any sale must still be approved by Congress and would be the first major
aircraft purchase from the United States by Taiwan since 1992. During
her visit to Hawaii last week, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen
confirmed that Taiwan had requested a purchase of new fighter jets from
the United States. Days later, two Chinese fighter planes crossed the
median line in the Taiwan Strait that divides China and Taiwan -- the
first time this has occurred for 20 years.

Even if the F-16V sale goes ahead, **[Taiwan's new planes will not alter
the military balance between China and Taiwan]{.underline}**, nor
dissuade the mainland from further provocations such as the median line
flyover. **[That is not Beijing's primary concern, however. The most
important calculation China must make is not the relative capabilities
of the Taiwanese armed forces but how the United States will respond in
the event of a crisis or conflict in the Taiwan Strait. Every clue with
respect to uncovering U.S. intention is vital because U.S. intervention
could tip the military balance against China in any such
conflict.]{.underline}** In any event, it guarantees the end of any
"acceptable cost" outcome in the event of conflict for China.

Under the United States' 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, any attempt to
forcibly determine Taiwan's future is considered "a threat to peace and
security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United
States." To prevent that, Washington is obligated to sell "arms of a
defensive character" to Taipei to allow the latter to defend itself and
dissuade China from launching any military action.
**[Since]{.underline}** the Bill **[Clinton]{.underline}** era,
**[administrations have denied Taiwan's request to purchase new fighter
planes on the basis that the grey line from "defense" to "offense" might
be crossed.]{.underline}**

Speaking from Hawaii, Tsai let the cat out of the bag when she said the
purchase of advanced fourth generation fighters would "greatly enhance
our land and air capabilities, strengthen military moral and show to the
world the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense." It is the last line
which sends shivers down the spine of mainland leaders.

**[Since the T]{.underline}**aiwan **[R]{.underline}**elations
**[A]{.underline}**ct **[came into force, the United States has
deliberately embarked on a policy of "strategic ambiguity" with respect
to its military commitments to Taiwan in the event the latter is
attacked.]{.underline}** Whether the United States intervenes is a
matter of political judgment and strategic assessment.
**[Under]{.underline}** the Barack **[Obama]{.underline}**
administration, **[the decision to only offer Taipei upgrades to its
aging F-16 A/B planes suggested to Beijing that de-escalating tensions
arising from differences over Taiwan was the predominant
mindset.]{.underline}**

**[In contrast]{.underline}**, the **[Trump]{.underline}**
administration **[has shown unprecedented willingness to escalate
tensions with China over political, strategic, and economic
differences]{.underline}**. The speech by Vice President Mike Pence last
October at the Hudson Institute and the 2017 National Security Strategy
pulled no punches in identifying China as a comprehensive rival to the
United States. **[If the sale of F-16V planes goes through, then, it is
evidence that the mindset in Washington with respect to Taiwan has also
changed and is less accepting of mainland sensibilities and demands.
Such a sale would be an indication that preserving de facto Taiwanese
independence is once more considered critical to U.S. and allied
strategy when it comes to keeping the PLA confined to inside the
so-called First Island Chain.]{.underline}**

#### Maintaining the credibility of the One China policy is key to prevent war -- without US reversal, arms sales will inevitably cross China's red line

**You and Hao** 20**18** -- Ji You is Professor and head of the
Department of Government, University of Macau. Yufan Hao is Dean of the

Military Interactions in the Taiwan Strait," *China Review*, Volume 18,
Number 3) bhb

**[As far as the PLA is concerned]{.underline}**, the **[Sino-U.S.
military ties]{.underline}** are the vulnerable point in the overall
relations and **[will likely worsen with power transition deepening in
the region.]{.underline}** Under this logic of evolution, there is
little both militaries can do to reverse the trend given the zero-sum
nature of the contention. Institutionally, the U.S. military is
forbidden to maintain substantial contacts with the PLA by U.S. law. For
instance, the U.S. 2000 National Defense Authorization Act singles out
12 areas where the U.S. military should not interact with the PLA,
leaving the bilateral cooperation only in those less than meaningful
agendas such as antipiracy and humanitarian assistance.80
**[The]{.underline}** previously mentioned \"third party factor,\" such
as the **[Taiwan issue, has set insurmountable barriers for both parties
to address the challenge of \"trust deficits.\" If the current strife is
not eased, the two militaries will be gradually locked in a collision
course and catch Taiwan in the cross-fire.]{.underline}** For instance,
**[both militaries regard U.S. arms sales to Taiwan to be more of a
political issue than a military one.]{.underline}** To the United States
it is even of only symbolic military significance.81 The outcome is
strikingly different. The Pentagon refuses \[End Page 111\] to discuss
the issue with the PLA due to its \"political\" nature. Technically, the
PLA would not care too much about the sold arms, which would not alter
the Strait balance of power. However, **[Beijing\'s political depiction
that the sales are violating China\'s sovereignty fundamentally clashes
with Washington\'s view]{.underline}** that arms sales to Taiwan are a
symbol of U.S. security commitment to its allies and partners to sustain
its global and regional leadership. **[The sales will
continue]{.underline}**, partly because they commercially benefit the
United States and partly because the political cost is relatively low.82
**[When China and the United States cannot deal with the thorn, and
politically it is unresolvable, the option left to the PLA is very
limited: suspension of military ties]{.underline}**, set by Deng
Xiaoping and tried six times so far. In fact, **[such an option is
increasingly ineffective and entraps Beijing in the
process.]{.underline}** In a way, the new package of arms sales in July
2017 approved by Trump was moderate in content, although significant in
expressing continued U.S. support to Taiwan by the new administration.
The PLA has not adopted the usual countermeasure of suspension of ties
with the U.S. military. Yet **[the dilemma lingers on and the solution
is nowhere in sight. The fatal test will emerge when the Pentagon
crosses a PLA red line on arms sales]{.underline}**: the F-35s or
submarines. **[Damocles\' sword hangs above.]{.underline}**

6\. Conclusion

**[The Beijing-Washington-Taipei trilateral relationship has entered
uncharted waters.]{.underline}** The last time it became lopsided and
precarious was when Chen Shui-bian discarded the one-China framework,
which, as the largest common denominator, ensured stability of the
trilateral relations no matter how uneasy it was. Tsai may not go as far
as Chen did, but her renouncement of the 1992 Consensus at least opened
a large window for the Strait\'s confrontation.

**[Now, the more strategic challenge to the trilateral relationship is
the unpredictable state of contention between Beijing and
Washington]{.underline}**, which is the key link in determining the
nature and trajectory of the long-term development of the trilateral
interactions. **[When Washington]{.underline}** also **[gives up the
one-China framework]{.underline}**, Taiwan would become the first chip
in a domino collapse in Sino-U.S. relations, since **[a critical fuse in
war aversion]{.underline}** in the Strait and between China and the
United States **[would be removed]{.underline}**. Now a qualitative turn
from bad to worse has been visible since the leadership change in
Washington and Taipei. \[End Page 112\] **[Fortunately, the tipping
point has not been crossed over and all three sides are conscious about
the cost of a breakdown.]{.underline}** The Strait militarization is
deepening but still under broader political and strategic calculation by
the leadership of the three parties. Taiwan is still under the chain of
U.S. strategic calculus vis-à-vis China. The problem is that **[if the
Sino-U.S. rivalry becomes zero-sum, an exit may not be easy to
find]{.underline}**. The triangle may fall in the end.

**[A clear sign of such a trend is increased militarization in the
trilateral relationship. Combatized militarization across the Strait has
reemerged as a logical result of the Strait\'s political rapprochement
collapse]{.underline}**. Even if this has not reached the level of
combat surge in the Chen Shui-bian days, such a direction is dangerously
in one\'s imagination.

#### New arms sales will cause war via miscalculation -- that escalates to nuclear conflict

**Symonds** 4-3-**19** -- Peter Symonds is a senior analyst in
international affairs with the wsws.org, a socialist organization
("Confrontation between Chinese and Taiwanese fighter jets,"
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2019/04/03/taiw-a03.html) bhb

**[A 10-minute aerial confrontation between Chinese and Taiwanese
fighter jets over the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}** on Sunday has once
again **[highlighted the dangers of a war in Asia fueled by the Trump
administration, which has deliberately inflamed the region's volatile
flashpoints.]{.underline}**

Taiwan condemned what it described as a "reckless and provocative" move
by Beijing after two Chinese warplanes crossed the de-facto maritime
border in the Taiwan Strait known as the "median line." The Taiwanese
military scrambled its own fighter planes to warn off the Chinese jets.

Taiwanese presidential spokesman Huang Chung-yen declared that China
"should stop acting in ways that endanger regional peace and well-being,
and not become an international troublemaker." He said that Taiwan's
president, Tsai Ing-wen, had been informed and directed the island's
armed forces to "take all necessary combat preparedness measures."

If Chinese warplanes did cross the median line, it would be the first
incursion since 2011 which was judged to be accidental. Beijing is yet
to comment on Sunday's incident, which comes in the wake of a series of
US moves that are aimed at bolstering ties with Taiwan and calling into
question its adherence to the so-called One China policy.

US President Richard Nixon's rapprochement with China in 1972 involved
the tacit recognition of Beijing as the legitimate ruler of all China,
including Taiwan. In 1979, the US formally established diplomatic
relations and ended its ties with the military dictatorship on Taiwan
established by the Kuomintang (KMT) after its defeat in the 1949 Chinese
revolution. At the same time, Washington committed to opposing any
forcible reunification with Taiwan by Beijing and to continuing arms
sales to Taipei.

**[Trump, who on assuming office publicly called the One China policy
into question, has repeatedly and deliberately provoked Beijing by
boosting arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}**, increasing US naval
operations in the tense Taiwan Strait, and by signing the Taiwan Travel
Act into law authorising top level contact between US and Taiwanese
civilian and military officials.

Prior to Sunday's aerial stand-off, the US military sent two ships---the
Navy destroyer Curtis Wilbur and Coast Guard cutter Berholf---through
the Taiwan Strait for the third time this year and the sixth time since
it resumed such transits last July. The Chinese foreign ministry stated
that it had lodged "representations" with Washington and urged caution
by the US "to avoid harming Sino-US relations and stability in the
Taiwan Strait."

Last Wednesday, Taiwanese President Tsai used a so-called "transit stop"
in Hawaii to launch a broadside against China and call for a beefing up
of US arms sales to Taipei in remarks delivered via video link to the
right-wing US think tank, the Heritage Foundation.

Tsai accused Beijing of trying to "alter the status quo" and "undermine
our democratic institutions." She dismissed China's "one nation, two
systems" proposal for unifying Taiwan with the mainland and declared
that China's actions "underscored the need for Taiwan to increase our
self-defence and deterrence capacities."

Tsai belongs to the Democratic Progressive Party, which is based on
Taiwanese nationalism and does not accept the current status quo in
relations with China. While stopping short of declaring formal
independence from China, which could provoke a Chinese attack, the DPP,
encouraged by the Trump administration, has adopted a more assertive
stance for Taiwan.

Tsai was touring the Pacific in a bid to shore up Taiwan's diplomatic
relations with three tiny Pacific Island states---Palau, Nauru and the
Marshall Islands. The three are among the few countries in the world to
maintain relations with Taiwan, rather than China.

The most significant aspect of Tsai's comments was a call **[for the US
to sell more than 60 advanced F-16V fighter jets to
Taiwan]{.underline}**, as well as M1 heavy tanks, which she said would
"greatly enhance our land and air capacities, strengthen military morale
and show the world the US commitment to Taiwan's defence."

The US has not sold fighter jets to Taiwan since 1992. While the F-16V
fighters are fourth generation, not fifth generation warplanes, they are
fitted with advanced radar and avionics, unlike Taiwan's present aging
fleet of F-16s. The US has so far refused to sell its fifth-generation
stealth fighters, the F-22 and F-35, to Taiwan.

While the sale would not immediately alter the military balance between
China and Taiwan, it **[would be a clear sign that Washington is
strengthening ties with Taipei and would enhance Taiwan's capacity to
take part in a US-led war against China.]{.underline}** The island's
strategic location just off the Chinese mainland prompted US General
MacArthur to describe it in 1950 as "an unsinkable aircraft carrier" in
the event of war.

Bloomberg reported on Monday: "Trump administration officials have given
tacit approval to Taipei's request to buy more than 60 Lockheed Martin
Corp. F-16s, according to people familiar with the matter."

Suggestions that the US sale could proceed have sent shockwaves through
Beijing. The Chinese foreign ministry last week said that it had lodged
"stern representations" with the US, while the defence ministry warned
that the sale undermined the One China policy.

Senior Colonel Wu Qian told the media last Thursday: "Any words or
actions that undermine the One China policy are tantamount to shaking
the foundation of China-US relations, are inconsistent with the
fundamental interests of China and the United States and are also
extremely dangerous."

**[China's show of air power over the Taiwan Strait was clearly meant as
a warning to both Taiwan and the US]{.underline}**.

Taiwan, along with the Korean Peninsula and the South China Sea, are
among the most volatile and dangerous flashpoints in the world. Yet
**[the Trump administration is recklessly disrupting longstanding
diplomatic norms as it escalates]{.underline}** its confrontation with
China over trade and steps up **[its military preparations for
war.]{.underline}**

Trump's aggressive stance towards Beijing is a continuation of the Obama
administration's "pivot to Asia" aimed at encircling China and building
up US military forces in the Indo-Pacific. US imperialism is determined
to maintain its global hegemony if need be through military force
against China, Russia or any other potential rival.

**[The danger is that a minor incident in the Taiwan Strait, whether
deliberate or accidental, could become the trigger for a conflict
between nuclear-armed powers that escalates out of control into all-out
war]{.underline}**.

#### U.S.-China war causes extinction 

**Wittner 11** --- Lawrence S. Wittner, Emeritus Professor of History at
the State University of New York at Albany, holds a Ph.D. in History
from Columbia University, 2011 ("Is a Nuclear War with China Possible?,"
*Huntington News*, November 28^th^, Available Online at
http://www.huntingtonnews.net/14446)

**[While nuclear weapons exist, there remains a danger that they will be
used]{.underline}**. After all, **[for centuries national conflicts have
led to wars, with nations employing their deadliest
weapons]{.underline}**. The current deterioration of U.S. relations with
**[China might end up providing us with yet another example of this
phenomenon]{.underline}**. **[The gathering tension between the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and China is
clear]{.underline}** enough. Disturbed by China's growing economic and
military strength, the U.S. government recently challenged China's
claims in the South China Sea, increased the U.S. military presence in
Australia, and deepened U.S. military ties with other nations in the
Pacific region. According to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the
United States was "asserting our own position as a Pacific power." But
**[need this lead to nuclear war?]{.underline}** Not necessarily. And
yet, **[there are signs that it could]{.underline}**. After all, **[both
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and China possess
large numbers of nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. The U.S. government
threatened to attack China with nuclear weapons during the Korean War
and, later, during the conflict over the future of China's offshore
islands, Quemoy and Matsu. In the midst of the latter confrontation,
President Dwight Eisenhower declared publicly, and chillingly, that U.S.
nuclear weapons would "be used just exactly as you would use a bullet or
anything else." Of course, China didn't have nuclear weapons then. Now
that it does, perhaps the behavior of national leaders will be more
temperate. But the loose nuclear threats of U.S. and Soviet government
officials during the Cold War, when both nations had vast nuclear
arsenals, should convince us that, even as the military ante is raised,
nuclear saber-rattling persists. **[Some pundits argue that nuclear
weapons prevent wars between nuclear-armed nations]{.underline}**; and,
admittedly, there haven't been very many---at least not yet. **[But the
Kargil War of 1999]{.underline}**, **[between nuclear-armed India and
nuclear-armed Pakistan]{.underline}**, **[should convince us that such
wars can occur]{.underline}**. Indeed, in that case, the conflict almost
slipped into a nuclear war. Pakistan's foreign secretary threatened
that, if the war escalated, his country felt free to use "any weapon" in
its arsenal. During the conflict, Pakistan did move nuclear weapons
toward its border, while India, it is claimed, readied its own nuclear
missiles for an attack on Pakistan. At the least, though, don't nuclear
weapons deter a nuclear attack? Do they? Obviously, NATO leaders didn't
feel deterred, for, throughout the Cold War, NATO's strategy was to
respond to a Soviet conventional military attack on Western Europe by
launching a Western nuclear attack on the nuclear-armed Soviet Union.
Furthermore, if U.S. government officials really believed that nuclear
deterrence worked, they would not have resorted to championing "Star
Wars" and its modern variant, national missile defense. Why are these
vastly expensive---and probably unworkable---military defense systems
needed if other nuclear powers are deterred from attacking by U.S.
nuclear might? Of course, the bottom line for those Americans convinced
that nuclear weapons safeguard them from a Chinese nuclear attack might
be that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is far greater than its Chinese
counterpart. Today, it is estimated that the U.S. government possesses
over five thousand nuclear warheads, while the Chinese government has a
total inventory of roughly three hundred. Moreover, only about forty of
these Chinese nuclear weapons can reach the United States. Surely the
United States would "win" any nuclear war with China. But what would
that "victory" entail? **[A nuclear attack by China would immediately
slaughter at least 10 million Americans in a great storm of blast and
fire, while leaving many more dying horribly of sickness and radiation
poisoning. The Chinese death toll in a nuclear war would be far higher.
Both nations would be reduced to smoldering, radioactive
wastelands]{.underline}**. Also, **[radioactive debris sent aloft by the
nuclear explosions would blot out the sun and bring on a "nuclear
winter" around the globe---destroying agriculture, creating worldwide
famine, and generating chaos and destruction]{.underline}**. Moreover,
in another decade the extent of this catastrophe would be far worse. The
Chinese government is currently expanding its nuclear arsenal, and by
the year 2020 it is expected to more than double its number of nuclear
weapons that can hit the United States. The U.S. government, in turn,
has plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars "modernizing" its
nuclear weapons and nuclear production facilities over the next decade.
**[To avert the enormous disaster of a U.S.-China nuclear war, there
are]{.underline}** two **[obvious actions that can be taken. The first
is to get rid of nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, as the nuclear powers
have agreed to do but thus far have resisted doing. **[The
second]{.underline}**, conducted while the nuclear disarmament process
is occurring, **[is to improve U.S.-China relations. If the American and
Chinese people are interested in ensuring their survival and that of the
world, they should be working to encourage these
policies]{.underline}**.

### 1AC -- US China Relations Advantage

#### US-China relations are on the brink of collapse -- arms sales policy will determine the future of cooperation

**Rudd** 4-24-**19** -- Kevin Rudd is a Senior Fellow, Belfer Center for
Science and International Affairs ("Even a Deal on Trade Won't Paper
Over the Widening Gap Between Washington and Beijing,"
https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/even-deal-trade-wont-paper-over-widening-gap-between-washington-and-beijing)
bhb

**[Washington and Beijing are poised to agree on a new trade
arrangement. Once that deal is done, diplomatic practitioners in both
capitals will turn their attention to the rest of the U.S.-China
relationship]{.underline}** --- spanning national security, artificial
intelligence, human rights and the overall political situation between
the two countries.

Those who follow the dynamics of the U.S.-China relationship closely
have carefully analyzed Vice President Pence's speech last October at
the Hudson Institute. It was arguably the most hard-line speech
delivered by any U.S. administration against China since the
normalization of diplomatic relations in 1979. Together with the
National Security Strategy of December 2017 and the National Defense
Strategy of January 2018, Pence's remarks marked the end of strategic
engagement and the start of a new era of strategic competition between
the United States and China. According to the vice president, this would
involve a fundamental reset by the United States across all domains of
U.S. policy.

Over the past 12 months, the Trump administration has been busily
fleshing out this new policy toward China. What we do not know, however,
is what will happen within the administration once the trade deal is
signed, sealed and delivered.

The first possibility is that President Trump, having (as he sees it)
honored his promise to his political base during the 2016 campaign to
secure a "fair deal" for the first time between China and the United
States on exports and jobs, will then delegate the details to his
subordinates. In this scenario, the national security hawks in the
Pentagon, State Department, the National Security Council, and the
intelligence community would then be unleashed to implement a
comprehensive strategy that seeks to constrain China's increasingly
assertive international behavior.

The alternative scenario is that President Trump, who has stated
repeatedly his high personal regard for Chinese President Xi Jinping,
will act as a broader "guardian" of the U.S.-China relationship and not
allow the hawks in his entourage to prosecute such a robust strategy
against Beijing. Trump, it will be noted from the official record, has
rarely if ever attacked China over its strategic policies in the wider
Indo-Pacific region, including the South China Sea. Nor has Trump
addressed China's broader economic and political challenges to America's
long-term status as the largest economy and largest military power in
the world. Nor can we find any record of a public position taken by
Trump on China's human rights record. Indeed, the president has often
chosen to equivocate about human rights questions in the broader
international diplomacy of his administration. It is therefore entirely
possible that Trump, in order to protect the implementation of his
bilateral trade agreement with his Chinese counterpart, will choose to
keep the rest of his administration in check to avoid damage being done
to what he really cares about --- American trade and economic interests.

**[The question of which way Trump will jump in the post-trade-deal
world is one of current concern in both Washington and Beijing. Chinese
policymakers are understandably anxious about which way Trump will
go]{.underline}** --- and the hawks in his own administration are
anxious as well. Xi will be particularly keen to secure maximum leverage
over Trump in the wake of the trade agreement --- not only to prevent
the outbreak of a fresh trade war but also to prevent the United States
from gaining advantages in other areas of the relationship. **[Xi will
be especially sensitive to what the Trump administration does next on
Taiwan, including future arms sales]{.underline}** to the island.

**[The uncomfortable truth is that the two countries face a deepening
divergence of values and interests. The economic and military gap
between them is narrowing,]{.underline}** and both recognize that their
mastery of high technologies of the future (of which artificial
intelligence is but one) will ultimately determine their future claims
to dominant superpower status. **[Given these realities, it is difficult
to imagine a new bilateral relationship that will be based on policy
principles substantive enough to prevent the two countries from
gradually sliding in the direction of crisis, conflict or even
war.]{.underline}**

**[The bottom line is the U.S.-China relationship remains
brittle.]{.underline}** **[There has been little engagement between the
two sides over the past two years on the overall foreign and security
policy dimensions of the relationship.]{.underline}** Little political
and diplomatic ballast remains. And both the Trump administration and
Xi's team remain deeply conscious of the fact that, ahead of next year's
congressional and presidential elections, Trump will be facing a
Democratic Party eager to attack him from the right on China for any
perceived concessions he may make to the Chinese in the critical year
ahead.

#### China perceives arms sales to Taiwan as a violation of sovereignty -- reductions will revitalize relations

More important, however, is that focusing on the quality of current
cross strait relations overlooks two other less direct, but potentially
more significant, benefits of U.S. accommodation on Taiwan. First,
**[U.S. support for Taiwan is one of the most important, possibly the
most important, policy-driven sources of China's suspicions about U.S.
motives and intentions.]{.underline}** Although the United States does
not take a position on what the final outcome of the Taiwan issue should
be, China considers **[U.S. support of Taiwan a key source of "strategic
distrust."]{.underline}** A recent study by two leading authorities on
U.S.-China relations concludes that **[Beijing views U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan "as confirming American arrogance and determination to interfere
in China's domestic affairs and to prevent peaceful unification from
occurring, thereby harming a clearly-articulated Chinese core
interest."]{.underline}** In a similar vein, their report argues that
"continuing to provide Taiwan with advanced weapons . . . is viewed as
pernicious in Chinese eyes and has added to suspicion that Washington
will disregard Chinese interests and sentiments as long as China's power
position is secondary to America's."68 Nathan and Scobell conclude that
"most Chinese see strategic motives at the root of American behavior.
They believe that keeping the Taiwan problem going helps the U.S. tie
China down."69 Similarly, **[a prominent Chinese analyst argues: "The
position the U.S. takes on the Taiwan issue determines the essence of
American strategy toward China, and thus determines the quality and
status of U.S.-China relations."]{.underline}**70 Xu Hui, a professor at
China's National Defense University, holds that "U.S. policies toward
Taiwan have been and are the fundamental cause of some anti-American
sentiment among the Chinese public\....I assure you that **[a posture
change of the U.S. policy on Taiwan will remove the major obstacle for
our military-to-military relations and also strengthen Sino-American
cooperation by winning the hearts and minds of 1.3 billion Chinese
people."]{.underline}**71 In short, **[ending the U.S. commitment to
Taiwan has the potential to dramatically improve U.S.-China relations,
which in turn could increase the possibility of cooperation on other
issues and reduce the probability of competition and
conflict]{.underline}**.

### 1AC -- Cyber Scenario

#### Strong US-China relations are key to cyber norms and cooperation

THE WAY AHEAD **[The road to hell]{.underline}**, it is often said,
**[is paved with good intentions.]{.underline}** While there is no
dearth of sound ideas for de-confliction in cyberspace, **[China and the
United States]{.underline}** have nonetheless experienced and
**[will]{.underline}** most likely continue to **[go through periods of
intense friction triggered by]{.underline}** a series of **[policies
adopted and actions their governments undertake to assert their
sovereignty]{.underline}** and promote their respective national
interests. But at the most fundamental level **[both parties do have a
common interest in working together to]{.underline}** effectively manage
and **[control their differences, avoid military
conflicts]{.underline}**, and build together a more benign international
environment. **[Serious military conflict may be caused
by]{.underline}** not only traditional security issues in hotspot
regions, but also by **[friction in the newer security
domains]{.underline}**, especially space and cyberspace. **[Crisis in
cyberspace]{.underline}** presently **[holds]{.underline}** particularly
**[ominous prospects for escalation between China and the United
States]{.underline}** for several reasons. **[First, there is the
attribution challenge]{.underline}**. Mutual
**[suspicions]{.underline}**, which **[currently run high on both
sides]{.underline}**, may **[result in flawed attribution]{.underline}**
of the responsibility **[for malicious cyber activity]{.underline}** and
result **[in miscalculated response]{.underline}**. **[Second, cyber
offense is viewed as an asymmetric tool]{.underline}** by less advanced
countries. Both China and the United States present tempting targets for
some risk-takers to launch cyber attacks, trying to hit-and-run. As
cyber **[threats are]{.underline}** always **[imminent
and]{.underline}** often **[anonymous]{.underline}**, **[they might lead
to misunderstanding between]{.underline}** the two **[big
powers]{.underline}**. Third, nations that benefit most from cyberspace,
such as China and the United States, are also the ones most vulnerable
to cyber attacks. This fact results in a higher potential that they may
be inclined to be preemptive in the event of a cyber threat. Fourth, the
U.S. government's professed doctrine to retaliate with all appropriate
means to cyber attacks may be useful for deterrence purposes. But if
actually implemented, it could also gravely escalate an ongoing crisis.
Retaliation may quickly lead to discharge of fire in physical domains in
response to cyber incidents or, at a minimum, to Chinese anxiety that
this may be the case regardless if warranted, and the implementation of
corresponding Chinese measures in anticipation of such U.S. action. But
**[none of this is]{.underline}** truly **[inevitable. The hard-core
security]{.underline}**, economic, and **[political interests of both
states do align]{.underline}**. China has been most explicit that this
is the case and has repeatedly expressed its desire to maintain a stable
relationship with the United States. In his report delivered at the 19th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Chinese President Xi
Jinping advocated the idea of fostering "a new type of international
relations and build\[ing\] a community with a shared future for mankind,
which included building a framework for major country relations
featuring overall stability and balanced development."35 Furthermore,
the International Strategy of Cooperation on Cyberspace issued by China
in 2017 emphasized the importance of peace and stability in cyberspace,
listing it as one of the nine action plans. This document clearly
declared China's commitment to "participate in bilateral and
multilateral discussions on confidence-building measures, take
preventive diplomatic measures, and address various cyber security
threats through dialogue and consultation."36 What's more, **[China
professes a positive attitude]{.underline}** toward playing an active
role in promoting global cyber governance. **[To build a community for a
shared future in cyberspace]{.underline}**, which is an integral part of
the community with a shared future for mankind, international
cooperation on cyber governance is indispensable. Xi reiterated the
"general trend and common aspiration of the people to promote the reform
of the global cyberspace governance system by sticking to a multilateral
approach with multi-party participation from the government,
international organizations, internet enterprises, technology
communities, non-governmental institutions, and individuals."37 China
supports UN efforts to adopt resolutions regarding information and
cybersecurity and actively takes part in the processes of UNGGE;
promotes cooperation among member states in SCO, BRICS, and ARF; and
consistently enhances bilateral partnerships on cybersecurity. Following
a consensus reached with the United States in 2015 during Xi's visit,
China has signed cybersecurity agreements with five other countries in
three years, including the UK, Australia, Russia, Brazil, and Canada.
From this perspective, more cooperation with the United States in the
political-military dimension could not only improve bilateral relations
but also set examples for further cooperation with international
society. **[The U.S. government undoubtedly shares the same ambition to
develop constructive governance of cyberspace]{.underline}**, and is
also wedded to a vision for doing so that combines multilateral
instruments with bilateral U.S.-Chinese ones. **[Even the otherwise
mercurial Trump has weighed in to ease the sanctions his administration
has imposed]{.underline}** on ZTE for violating U.S. law, as a personal
gesture to Xi, and has more recently professed similar willingness to
step in once again to resolve the extradition case of a Huawei senior
official. He has done so even in the face of vociferous opposition from
some security hawks in the United States. But compatibility of
interests, lofty visions, and even ad hoc constructive steps will not
suffice here. **[They have not been sufficient thus far to prevent the
downward spiral]{.underline}** in trust **[between the two nations. So
what is ultimately necessary is a grand bargain]{.underline}**,
inevitably at the presidential level. Not quite at the same scale as
when former U.S. president Richard Nixon opened to China but quite
similar to the one struck originally between Obama and Xi in 2015,
**[albeit one that subsequently goes much further in its implementation
mechanisms. Only such action could open the way for the two nations to
break the current impasse and start implementing constructive steps of
the nature contemplated above]{.underline}**. Let us be clear. This is
not about trading core national security interests of either party. In
fact, quite the reverse, it is about safeguarding them. Similar to the
reciprocal steps presently being discussed between the United States and
China in the bilateral trade area, it is merely about prioritizing
concerns and interests. Some of the steps that could facilitate such a
grand bargain reside altogether outside the security realm, such as in
the domains of trade and investments. Others might be in the security
realm but outside cyber, such as on progress toward North Korea's
denuclearization. But ultimately there also has to be at least some
cyber component of the grand bargain for it to have the desirable effect
in cyberspace. What we put forward for consideration here is a cyber
quid pro quo that derives its inspiration from the overall Chinese
approach toward cyberspace stability as outlined by Xi. As we envisage
it, what would be required would be for both sides to undertake
reciprocal gestures of goodwill toward cyber stability. Toward that end,
the United States could be expected to move toward accepting, in some
form, the Chinese concept of cyber sovereignty, thereby addressing the
primary Chinese anxiety about domestic stability. To be more explicit,
the U.S. contribution would be to show deference to the Chinese
government and people on how they wish to govern cyberspace
domestically. In return, the United States could expect China to
reciprocate its goodwill by accepting to apply rather different rules to
international cyber rules of the road generally, and to its cyber
conduct toward the United States in particular. In practice what we have
in mind is that the United States would not endorse but would
nonetheless explicitly recognize the right of China, as it is presently
inclined, to apply what is now a rather intrusive cyber monitoring
regime internally in the interest of ensuring domestic stability. For
its side, China would explicitly accept (once again without necessarily
endorsing) that the United States applies its own conception of
international cybersecurity and self-defense in both peacetime and at
times of war. This would require China to be receptive to U.S. cyber
sovereignty concerns by taking far more assertive measures to enforce
its policy of preventing and punishing the use of Chinese territory, by
any party, to conduct cyber attacks against the United States (and
others), and to recognize that cyber weapons use in wartime would be
governed by the same rules that apply to the employment of other weapon
systems in self-defense. We believe that **[such understandings are
compatible with both nations' separate as well as common core interests
in and beyond cyberspace. Such understandings would greatly benefit the
international community]{.underline}**, precisely in the ways envisaged
by Xi at the 19th Communist Party Congress. Xi has already taken the
first bold step in this direction in his historic 2015 cyber
understanding with Obama, true to the famous adage from Lao Tzu that
"the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."38 The time
has now come to undertake the next step in cyberspace.

#### Joint dialogue resolves unintentional cyber confrontation

**Levite and Jinghua 19** (Ariel Levite; nonresident senior fellow in
the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment, served as the
deputy national security adviser for defense policy and was head of the
Bureau of International Security and Arms Control, PhD, Cornell
University, MA, Cornell University; Lyu Jinghua; visiting scholar with

accessed 6/25/19) \[DS\]

WHAT RULES OF THE ROAD MIGHT STILL PROVE POSSIBLE (AND DESIRABLE)?
**[The United States and China already have in place several formal
platforms for cyber dialogue]{.underline}**, ranging **[from bilateral
ones]{.underline}** (**[like China-U.S. Law Enforcement and
Cybersecurity Dialogue]{.underline}**) **[to multilateral
ones]{.underline}** (**[like discussions and cooperation in the
framework of the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Interpol Asia and South
Pacific Working Party on IT Crime, and obviously the
UNGGE]{.underline}**). **[They have]{.underline}** also been party to
some **[common cybersecurity principles]{.underline}** **[agreed upon at
the level of the G20. Informally, track 1.5 and track 2
dialogues]{.underline}** also abound, including ones involving multiple
stakeholders such as the Guanchao Forum. So **[venues and platforms to
promote bilateral]{.underline}** Chinese-U.S. **[collaboration in
cyberspace are not in short supply]{.underline}**. What is acutely
needed are concrete steps that are viable even under the currently
charged circumstances that could help transform the corrosive bilateral
dynamics on cyber matters. Where are these to be found? Several options
come to mind here. First, progress on building a common glossary of
cyber terminology. A necessary first step to achieve progress on
building some bilateral trust in cyberspace is to facilitate clearer
understanding of the respective parties' policies and obligations,
thereby helping to calibrate expectations and avoid misunderstandings.
This undertaking requires an effort that is far greater than merely
compiling translations of cyber terms between Mandarin and English.
Presently, China and the United States often use the same cyber terms or
at least similar ones but understand their meanings quite differently.
And even different governmental agencies in the same country use diverse
definitions for cyber terms and actions (in many cases, influenced by
sharply distinct domestic purposes) or interpret them in widely
different ways. And the key terms and definitions in cyberspace evolve
rather quickly as understandings of the phenomenon and technology
change. Thus, an important first step would be to have each side share
with the other its own official definitions of key terms as they pertain
to cyber actions of mutual relevance. At a minimum, each side could
better understand what the other side thinks and means when employing
these terms. A more ambitious undertaking in the same vein would see
both nations developing common or shared definitions of these terms that
would help diminish the space for misunderstandings whether certain
actions they undertake are consistent with their interpretation of
obligations they have taken upon themselves to do or refrain from
certain cyber actions (for example, to refrain from commercial
espionage). Obviously even mere bilateral discussions on these seemingly
arcane issues would have value in their own right. The value of this
exercise to diminish unintentional distrust and risky misunderstandings
between the two parties should not be underestimated, especially if one
is to aim for more ambitious bilateral understandings on the rules of
the game in cyberspace. In this context, it is important to note that
although the term cyberspace has been used for almost forty years,
**[there is no shared understanding of concrete terms related to what
cyberspace constitutes,22 let alone over malicious and other purposeful,
legitimate, but contentious cyber activities]{.underline}**. The most
**[fundamental terms]{.underline}** relevant to cyber conflict, **[such
as defensive and offensive operations]{.underline}** in cyberspace,
cyberwar, cyber attack, and cyber weapons, are not understood in the
same way in Washington and Beijing. **[Such a set of terms is always
viewed as the premise]{.underline}** and basis **[for
negotiations]{.underline}**. In April 2011, a joint report on critical
terminology related to cybersecurity was published by EastWest Institute
and Moscow State University.23 There are other useful sources one could
draw on to begin preparing such a glossary.24 For example, a draft
report produced by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's
Cyber Policy Initiative surveys pertinent U.S. cyber operations terms
with precisely this U.S. and Chinese audience in mind.25 But until now,
unfortunately, there is no officially sanctioned product available for
this purpose between the Chinese and U.S. governments. **[For example,
common understandings or at least deliberations of what could constitute
armed attack provide the basis for discussions on land, sea, air, and
space power and conflicts, even if no consensus ultimately emerges. Let
us add that such exercises have proven useful in the past in various
arms control contexts, and could undoubtedly play a constructive role in
this context, too. Second, exercise of self-restraint]{.underline}** in
certain cyberspace operations. **[To avoid unintentional confrontation
is undoubtedly the primary common interest of China and the United
States in political-military dimensions of cyber relations.
Self-restraint]{.underline}** by these major powers **[is a necessary
foundation to achieve this goal]{.underline}**. Since they require no
prior interstate negotiations, formal ratification, or agreed
verification measures, these could be put in place relatively quickly
and could also be communicated to the other party quietly. **[They thus
provide a constructive way to get started that has value in and of
itself]{.underline}**, and could hopefully also make it possible **[to
transform such unilateral undertakings into more explicit and binding
bilateral]{.underline}** (and/or multilateral) understandings and
**[agreements]{.underline}**.

#### Cyber-attacks cause nuclear escalation

**Unal and** **Lewis 18** (Dr. Beyza Unal; a research fellow with the

**[The reliance on digital technologies in modern weapons systems -
particularly in nuclear weapons systems - has led to growing concerns
that cyberattacks may pose additional risks at a time of escalating
conflict]{.underline}**, which could undermine the confidence needed to
make reliable decisions. Cyber risks in nuclear weapons systems have
thus far received scant attention from the nuclear weapons policy
community. **[The potential impacts of a cyberattack on nuclear weapons
systems are enormous. Data hacks can reveal sensitive information on
facilities' layouts, personnel details, and design and operational
information. Cyber interference could destroy industrial control systems
within delivery\' platforms, such as submarines, causing them to
malfunction. In addition, clandestine attacks]{.underline}** could be
conducted on targeting information or operational commands, which **[may
not be discovered until the point of launch.]{.underline}** **[These
risks raise significant doubts as to the reliability and integrity of
nuclear weapons systems in a time of crisis]{.underline}**, regarding
the ability to: a) launch a weapon; b) prevent an inadvertent launch; c)
maintain command and control of all military systems; d) transmit
information and other communications; and e) the maintenance and
reliability\' of such systems. This paper will focus on cybersecurity
and cyber vulnerabilities and argue that the digitization of systems and
the use of emerging technologies - while providing several benefits -
increase the vulnerabilities to cyberattacks in nuclear weapons systems.
The first nuclear policies were instigated in the US decades ago and
each country that has developed nuclear weapons has established
individual doctrines and policies regarding their deployment and
potential use. **[The risks associated with nuclear weapons,
particularly given their capacity\' for devastating explosive yields and
long-term harmful radioactive impacts]{.underline}**, have been issues
for discussion ever since.1 This paper does not claim that emerging
technologies are the primary risk to consider in the nuclear field, or
that the risks of nuclear weapons are new. Rather, the paper argues that
while key risk areas have existed for a long time, new technology has
exacerbated these risks. With each new digital component embedded in the
nuclear weapons enterprise, new threat vectors may emerge. Solutions to
these risks, therefore, should go beyond applying cybersecurity policies
because, in this context, **[cyber risk reduction Is actually about
nuclear risk reduction. With the potential for such catastrophic
consequences from a nuclear weapons detonation attack it is crucial to
have the most robust nuclear policies in place. The likelihood of
attempted cyberattacks on nuclear weapons systems is relatively high and
increasing from advanced persistent threats from states and non-state
groups.]{.underline}** As an example of what is possible, the US Is
reported to have infiltrated parts of North Korea's missile systems and
caused test failures.2 **[Recent cases of cyberattacks indicate that
nuclear weapons systems could also be subject to interference, hacking,
and sabotage]{.underline}** through the use of malware or viruses, which
could infect digital components of a system at any time. **[Minuteman
silos,]{.underline}** for example, **[are believed to be particularly
vulnerable to cyberattacks]{.underline}**.3 Some of the known methods
that would affect the decision-making process for launching a nuclear
weapon include data manipulation, cyber jamming communication channels,
or cyber spoofing. In particular, **[successful cyber spoofing could
hijack decision-making with potentially devastating
consequences.]{.underline}**

### 1AC -- Warming

#### US-China Relations key to Warming 

**Sengupta 18** (Sengupta, Somini. "U.S.-China Friction Threatens to
Undercut the Fight Against Climate Change." The New York Times, The New
York Times, 7 Dec. 2018,
www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/climate/us-china-climate-change.html.)

**[They have the largest carbon footprints. Also the largest
economies]{.underline}**. Now, as diplomats meet in Poland for
high-stakes climate negotiations, **[a pitched standoff between the
United States and China threatens to slow global action on climate
change precisely at a time when the risks of catastrophe are
accelerating.]{.underline}**

**[The tensions between Washington and Beijing range from trade to
cybersecurity to military rivalry in the Pacific.]{.underline}** And
while some of those issues have simmered for years, **[cooperation in
the fight against climate change had once been a bright spot, so much so
that it propelled the creation of the landmark global agreement in Paris
in 2015 to curb greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}**.

**[But then the Trump administration announced its intention to pull out
of the Paris pact altogether,]{.underline}** rejecting the scientific
consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet. That
represented perhaps the most consequential diplomatic reversal of the
Trump era.

"The biggest threats to the planet are the lack of U.S. climate
leadership at home and the unwillingness of the U.S. to engage with
China," said **[Joanna Lewis, a China specialist at Georgetown
University. "The rest of the world looks to the U.S. and China for
leadership, and it has become clear that, as the alliance has waned,
global momentum to address climate change has slowed."]{.underline}**

Taken together, **[the emissions produced by the United States and China
account for more than 40 percent of the global total]{.underline}**.
**[In both countries, emissions went up this year]{.underline}**,
according to an analysis issued this week by the Global Carbon Project
in which **[one scientist likened the acceleration of global emissions
to "a speeding freight train."]{.underline}**

That fact hovers over Katowice, the Polish city where the United Nations
is leading two weeks of talks to figure out how to implement the Paris
Agreement. Adding to the urgency of that meeting**[, the promises made
so far under the Paris pact are nowhere enough to avert the worst
effects of climate change. A United Nations scientific report issued
this fall warned that, if emissions continued to rise at the current
rate, the planet would warm so fast that it could lead to widespread
food shortages, wildfires, and floods.]{.underline}**

**[It's hard to imagine a worse time for the world's two
behemoths]{.underline}** --- the United States, traditionally
representing the rich world in climate negotiations, and China,
representing the developing countries --- **[to be locked in a cycle of
intense distrust at the highest levels.]{.underline}**

"The U.S.-China climate honeymoon is definitely over. That much is very
clear," said Li Shuo, a senior policy adviser for Greenpeace Asia, based
in Beijing. "The U.S. is asking a lot but there's nothing that the U.S.
can give. That's the fundamental challenge."

**[For China's part]{.underline}** --- even though its emissions have
grown in the last two years, mainly because of continued coal use ---
**[the country is on track to meet its modest, self-imposed Paris
target, which is to reach peak emissions by 2030]{.underline}**. In
fact, it appears on track to do so ahead of schedule, according to
independent analysts. It is also ramping up renewable energy sources
faster than any country in the world. **[The emissions intensity of its
economy, geared to manufacture goods for the rest of the world, is
declining]{.underline}**.

At the same time though, coal plants have not closed down as fast as
some had expected. **[Much more worrying, China is exporting coal
technology abroad,]{.underline}** with its powerful state-owned
companies proposing to build coal-fired power plants from Kenya to
Pakistan, **[effectively exporting its carbon footprint.]{.underline}**

Now, with additional economic headwinds from Washington, **[China
confronts a new debate: Should it continue to move rapidly away from its
emissions-intensive industrial economy, or should it simply slow
down?]{.underline}**

Former Vice President Al Gore, who has been closely watching climate
diplomacy, said in an interview last week that although the trade war
with the United States could slow the country's transition away from a
heavily fossil fuel based economy, he did not think that China would
change course. Its leaders are under political pressure to clean up the
air. It is ramping up wind and solar energy sources. It is on track to
be the world's largest electric vehicle market. Its carbon market is to
come into effect next year, though only in a handful of sectors.

"They plan their work and work their plan," Mr. Gore said. "I expect
them to continue on the journey they mapped out regardless of what the
U.S. does."

**[So far, there is no evidence that China is reversing course. Still,
the United States posture, and the concerns over a continued slowdown of
the Chinese economy give ballast to Chinese promoters of heavy
industry]{.underline}**, some China analysts say, **[putting President
Xi Jinping under considerable pressure.]{.underline}**

Our planet is 4.5 billion years old. If that whole time was to be
reflected on a single one-year calendar then the dinosaurs died off
sometime late in the afternoon of December 27th and modern humans
emerged 200,000 years ago, or at around lunchtime on December 28th.
Therefore, human life on earth is very recent. Sometime on December 28th
humans made the first fires -- wood fires -- neutral in the carbon
balance. Now reflect on those most recent 200,000 years again on a
single one-year calendar and you might be surprised to learn that the
industrial revolution began only a few hours ago during the middle of
the afternoon on December 31st, 250 years ago, coinciding with the
discovery of underground carbon fuels. Over the 250 years carbon fuels
have enabled tremendous technological advances including a population
growth from about 800 million then to 7.5 billion today and the
consequent demand to extract even more carbon. This has occurred during
a handful of generations, which is hardly noticeable on our imaginary
one-year calendar. The release of this carbon -- however -- is changing
our climate at such a rapid rate that it threatens our survival and
presence on earth. It defies imagination that so much damage has been
done in such a relatively short time. **[The implications of climate
change are the single most significant threat to life on earth and, put
simply, we are not doing enough to rectify the damage]{.underline}**.
This relatively very recent ability to change our climate is an
inconvenient truth; **[the science is sound]{.underline}**. We know of
**[the complex set of interrelated national and global security risks
that are a result of global warming and the velocity at which climate
change is occurring]{.underline}**. We worry it may already be too late.
Climate change writ large has informed few, interested some, confused
many, and polarized politics. **[It has already led to an increase in
natural disasters]{.underline}** including but not limited to droughts,
storms, floods, fires etc. The year 2012 was among the 10 warmest years
on record according to an American Meteorological Society (AMS) report.
Research suggests that climate change is already affecting human
displacement; reportedly 36 million people were displaced in 2008 alone
because of sudden natural disasters. Figures for 2010 and 2011 paint a
grimmer picture of **[people displaced because of rising sea levels,
heat and storms. Climate change affects all natural systems. It impacts
temperature and consequently it affects water and weather patterns. It
contributes to desertification, deforestation and acidification of the
oceans. Changes in weather patterns may mean droughts in one area and
floods in another.]{.underline}** Counter-intuitively, perhaps, sea
levels rise but perennial river water supplies are reduced because
glaciers are retreating. As glaciers and polar ice caps melt, there is
an albedo effect, which is a double whammy of less temperature
regulation because of less surface area of ice present. This means that
less absorption occurs and also there is less reflection of the sun's
light. A potentially critical wild card could be **[runaway climate
change due to the release of methane from melting tundra]{.underline}**.
Worldwide permafrost soils contain about 1,700 Giga Tons of carbon,
which is about four times more than all the carbon released through
human activity thus far. The planet has already adapted itself to
dramatic climate change including a wide range of distinct geologic
periods and multiple extinctions, and at a pace that it can be managed.
It is **[human intervention that has accelerated the pace
dramatically:]{.underline}** An increased surface temperature,
**[coupled with more severe weather and changes in water distribution
will create uneven threats to our agricultural systems and will foster
and support the spread of insect borne diseases like]{.underline}**
Malaria, Dengue and the West Nile virus. **[Rising sea levels will
increasingly threaten our coastal population and infrastructure
centers]{.underline}** and with more than 3.5 billion people -- **[half
the planet -- depending on the ocean for their primary source of
food]{.underline}**, ocean acidification may dangerously undercut
critical natural food systems which would result in reduced rations.
Climate change also carries significant inertia. Even if emissions were
completely halted today, temperature increases would continue for some
time. Thus the impact is not only to the environment, water, coastal
homes, agriculture and fisheries as mentioned, but also would lead to
conflict and thus impact national security. **[Resource wars are
inevitable as countries respond, adapt and compete for the shrinking set
of those available resources.]{.underline}** These wars have arguably
already started and will continue in the future because climate change
will force countries to act for national survival; the so-called Climate
Wars. As early as 2003 Greenpeace alluded to a report which it claimed
was commissioned by the Pentagon titled: An Abrupt Climate Change
Scenario and Its Implications for U.S. National Security. It painted a
picture of a world in turmoil because global warming had accelerated.
The scenario outlined was both abrupt and alarming. The report offered
recommendations but backed away from declaring climate change an
immediate problem, concluding that it would actually be more incremental
and measured; as such it would be an irritant, not a shock for national
security systems. In 2006 the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) --
Institute of Public Research -- convened a board of 11 senior retired
generals and admirals to assess National Security and the Threat to
Climate Change. Their initial report was published in April 2007 and
made no mention of the potential acceleration of climate change. The
team found that **[climate change was a serious threat to national
security]{.underline}** and that it was: "most likely to happen in
regions of the world that are already fertile ground for extremism." The
team made recommendations from their analysis of regional impacts which
suggested the following. Europe would experience some fracturing because
of border migration. **[Africa would need more stability and
humanitarian operations provided by the United States. The Middle East
would experience a "loss of food and water security (which) will
increase pressure to emigrate across borders." Asia would suffer from
"threats to water and the spread of infectious disease]{.underline}**."
In 2009 the CIA opened a Center on Climate Change and National Security
to coordinate across the intelligence community and to focus policy. In
May 2014, CNA again convened a Military Advisory Board but this time to
assess National Security and the Accelerating Risk of Climate Change.
The report concludes that climate change is no longer a future threat
but occurring right now and the authors appeal to the security
community, the entire government and the American people to not only
build resilience against projected climate change impacts but to form
agreements to stabilize climate change and also to integrate climate
change across all strategy and planning. The calm of the 2007 report is
replaced by a tone of anxiety concerning the future coupled with calls
for public discourse and debate because "time and tide wait for no man."
The report notes a key distinction between resilience (mitigating the
impact of climate change) and agreements (ways to stabilize climate
change) and states that: Actions by the United States and the
international community have been insufficient to adapt to the
challenges associated with projected climate change. Strengthening
resilience to climate impacts already locked into the system is
critical, but this will reduce long-term risk only if improvements in
resilience are accompanied by actionable agreements on ways to stabilize
climate change. The 9/11 Report framed the terrorist attacks as less of
a failure of intelligence than a failure of imagination. Greenpeace's
2003 account of the Pentagon's alleged report describes a coming climate
Armageddon which to readers was unimaginable and hence the report was
not really taken seriously. It described: **[A world thrown into turmoil
by drought, floods, typhoons. Whole countries rendered
uninhabitable]{.underline}**. The capital of the Netherlands submerged.
The borders of the U.S. and Australia patrolled by armies firing into
waves of starving boat people desperate to find a new home. Fishing
boats armed with cannon to drive off competitors. **[Demands for access
to water and farmland backed up with nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. The
CNA and Greenpeace/Pentagon reports are both mirrored by similar
analysis by the World Bank which highlighted not only the physical
manifestations of climate change, but also **[the significant human
impacts that threaten to unravel decades of economic development, which
will ultimately foster conflict]{.underline}**.

### 1AC -- Solvency

#### Reducing arms sales to Taiwan solves war and relations -- unilateral concessions are key to bring China to the negotiating table 

**Glaser** 20**15** -- Charles L Glaser is a professor in the Elliott
School of International Affairs and the Department of Political Science
at George Washington University. He is also a fellow in the Kissinger
Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ("A
U.S.-China Grand Bargain?" International Security, Volume 39, Number 4)
bhb

**[U.S. unilateral adoption of]{.underline}** less dramatic changes in
the government's Taiwan policy---most importantly, **[slowing
or]{.underline}** **[ending]{.underline}** U.S. **[arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}**110---is an option that **[might provide a better
balance of risks and benefit]{.underline}**. Even this much smaller
change in U.S. policy, however, risks sending China the wrong signal.

**[Another way]{.underline}** to balance feasibility and benefits,
therefore, **[could be to look for a path that divides the grand bargain
into smaller, more attainable increments. One can imagine a series of
steps, including the United States ending its arms sales to Taiwan and
China ending its use of force to advance its maritime
claims]{.underline}**, that could be implemented sequentially to create
a phased grand bargain. **[This approach would enable the United States
to revert to its current Taiwan policy if China failed to uphold its
side of the phased agreement]{.underline}**. Another possibility might
include partial resolution of the maritime disputes. An agreement that
delayed resolution of the sovereignty disputes far into the future, or
indefinitely, while settling the resource disputes would be more
feasible to achieve than a full resolution. This type of agreement could
be possible because, for the most part, the sovereignty disputes can be
separated from the resource disputes. In fact, China and Japan reached
this type of arrangement in 2008, although it has yet to be
implemented.111 The United States could pursue a variant of this staged
approach that would enable it to try to push the diplomatic process
forward. **[In this more proactive model, the United States would make
its initial concession unilaterally, while explaining that further
concessions would hinge on China's reciprocation of its initial
move.]{.underline}**

#### Ending arms sales will induce a [cooperation spiral]{.underline} -- that will peacefully resolve the US commitment trap in Taiwan 

**Gomez** 20**16** -- Eric Gomez is a policy analyst for defense and
foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. ("A Costly Commitment:
Options for the Future of the U.S.-Taiwan Defense Relationship,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship?utm_content=buffer855fe&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)
bhb

The United States should step down from the implicit commitment to use
military force to preserve Taiwan's de facto independence. American
credibility is slowly eroding as China becomes more powerful, and the
commitment will be more costly to maintain for a relatively minor
benefit. Broadly speaking, **[the United States]{.underline}** has two
options for how it could implement this policy option: it
**[could]{.underline}** try to **[draw concessions from China to get
something in return for stepping down from the
commitment]{.underline}**, or it could unilaterally drop the commitment.
In either scenario, Taiwan would have to take on sole responsibility for
deterring Chinese military action.

A policy that wins concessions from China would be the more desirable of
the two options. Concessions could include resolution of other
territorial disputes involving China and American allies or dropping the
Chinese threat to use force against Taiwan. This would be characteristic
of what Charles Glaser calls a grand bargain, "an agreement in which two
actors make concessions across multiple issues to create a fair deal ...
that would have been impossible in an agreement that dealt with a single
issue."95 Making the end of the U.S. commitment to Taiwan contingent
upon Chinese concessions to resolve its other territorial disputes
peacefully would benefit both the United States and China.96 The United
States would free itself of an increasingly costly and risky commitment
to Taiwan's defense, but only if China compromises in ways that align
with U.S. allies' interests in the South and East China Seas. China
would have to limit its objectives in the South and East China Seas, but
in return would earn a major policy concession from the United States on
a core national interest that has much more importance than the other
territorial disputes.

If China proves unwilling to make concessions across multiple issue
areas, the United States could still push for concessions on China's
military posture toward Taiwan. Instead of demanding a concession on the
South China Sea dispute, U.S. policymakers could press China to take
actions that reduce the military threat it poses to Taiwan via an
incremental, reciprocal process of concessions.97 **[Refusing to sell
Taiwan any new military equipment would be a good way to initiate a
cooperation spiral]{.underline}**.

**[Stopping the sale of new equipment would not significantly reduce the
Taiwanese military's ability to defend itself for three reasons. First,
most equipment sold]{.underline}** to Taiwan by the United States
**[does not represent the latest in U.S. military technology and is
not]{.underline}** necessarily **[superior to new capabilities fielded
by the PLA]{.underline}**.98 **[Second, Taiwan's domestic defense
industry is capable of producing new equipment that is well-suited to
asymmetric defense, although it will take time for
Taiwan's]{.underline}** relatively small and underdeveloped **[defense
industry to reach its full potential.]{.underline}**99 **[Finally,
stopping the sale of new weapons still gives the United States the
latitude to sell spare parts and ammunition for weapons systems that
have already been sold. Halting the sale of new types of weapons systems
will signal a reduced U.S. commitment to Taiwan's security that would
not be overly disruptive to Taiwan's self-defense]{.underline}**.

**[One of several ways that Beijing might respond to this U.S.
concession on arms sales would be to reduce the number of short-range
ballistic missiles (SRBMs) within firing range of Taiwan.]{.underline}**
Currently there are more than 1,000 conventionally armed SRBMs (with a
maximum range of approximately 500 miles) in the PLA arsenal that could
strike Taiwan.100 Improvements in guidance technology have transformed
these missiles from inaccurate "terror weapons" that would likely target
cities to precision munitions better suited for strikes against military
airfields and ports.101Stationing the SRBMs out of range of Taiwan would
be a low-cost, but symbolically important, action. The missiles are
fired from mobile launchers that could be moved back into range of
Taiwan. However, the act of moving the missiles out of range would,
according to Lyle J. Goldstein, "show goodwill and increasing confidence
across the Strait and also between Washington and Beijing."102 **[If
China agrees to America's demand to relocate its ballistic missiles,
then additional steps could be taken to further reduce the threat China
poses to Taiwan]{.underline}**.

If China proved unwilling to make any concessions, either in other
territorial disputes or in cross-strait relations, the United States
could still unilaterally withdraw from its military commitment to
Taiwan. No demands or conditions would be placed on Chinese behavior.
American policymakers are unlikely to accept such a course of action
given recent shows of Chinese assertiveness. Charles Glaser explains,
"China appears too likely to misinterpret \[unilaterally ending the U.S.
commitment to defend Taiwan\], which could fuel Chinese overconfidence
and intensify challenges to U.S. interests."103 **[Unilateral withdrawal
would reduce the likelihood of U.S.-Chinese armed conflict, but the
dearth of other benefits would make the policy difficult for
policymakers to implement. Extracting some kind of concession from
China, either in cross-strait relations or in other territorial
disputes, should be a priority.]{.underline}**

Finally, stepping down from the commitment to defend Taiwan with
military force does not remove America's interest in keeping the Taiwan
Strait free of armed conflict. **[The United States would retain the
ability to punish China in other ways should it attack Taiwan.
Diplomatic isolation and economic sanctions]{.underline}** may not
inflict the same kinds of costs on Beijing as military force, but they
**[are additional costs that would have to be
absorbed.]{.underline}**104 Additionally, U.S. arms sales are separate
from the implicit commitment to defend Taiwan and could continue, albeit
in some reduced or modified form.105 Continuing to sell arms to Taiwan
while stepping down from the implicit commitment to use military force
to defend the island allows the United States to demonstrate support for
Taiwan's defense without taking on the risks associated with direct
intervention.106

Conclusion

The United States should no longer provide the military backstop for
Taiwan's de facto independence. **[The security commitment to Taiwan
outlined in the TRA is a product of a different time, when the United
States enjoyed clear military advantages over China, and Taiwan could be
defended on the cheap. China's growing military power strains the
credibility of the American commitment.]{.underline}** Policymakers in
Washington could respond to this changing environment by restoring
American military superiority, sustaining a minimum military advantage,
or stepping down from the commitment. All of these options carry risks
and negative consequences, but **[it is in the best long-term interest
of the United States to step down from the commitment to
Taiwan]{.underline}**.

American policymakers must come to terms with the idea that the balance
of power has become much more favorable for Beijing since the TRA was
adopted in 1979. Defending Taiwan is more difficult now than ever
before, and this trend will be very hard to reverse. **[The most
realistic way to reorient U.S. policy is to reach out to China to take
incremental, reciprocal steps that slowly bring about the end of
America's commitment.]{.underline}** This policy will be very difficult
for the United States to implement, but the advantages to U.S.-China
relations could be substantial. **[Changing the U.S.-Taiwan security
relationship would greatly reduce the likelihood of armed conflict
between the United States and China and could create opportunities for
U.S.-China cooperation that are currently beyond reach]{.underline}**.

### UQ -- F-16 Sales Coming

#### New F-16 sales are extremely controversial -- they signal a shift from defensive to offensive capabilities

**South China Morning Post** 4-1-**19** ("Donald Trump nears sale of new
F-16V jets to Taiwan, a move seen as 'huge shock' to Beijing,"
https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3004054/trump-nears-sale-new-f-16v-jets-taiwan-move-seen-huge-shock)
bhb

**[The US may finally sell Taiwan]{.underline}** the
**[warplanes]{.underline}** it has sought for more than a decade to
defend against China. Their arrival would deal more of a political shock
than a military blow to Beijing.

Trump administration officials have given tacit approval to Taipei's
request to buy more than 60 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-16s, according to
people familiar with the matter, **[setting the stage for the first such
deal since 1992.]{.underline}**

While a few dozen fighter jets would hardly tip the military balance
against the increasing powerful Chinese military, **[it would signal a
new American willingness to back the democratically run
island.]{.underline}**

**["For Beijing, it would be a huge shock,"]{.underline}** said Wu
Shang-su, a research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International
Studies in Singapore.

"But it would be more of a political shock than a military shock. It
would be, 'Oh, the US doesn't care how we feel.' **[It would
be]{.underline}** more of **[a symbolic or emotional
issue]{.underline}**."

The potential sale is among several gestures of US support for Taiwan in
recent months, even as President Donald Trump and Chinese counterpart Xi
Jinping near a deal to end the costly trade war.

The US also sailed a warship through the Taiwan Strait and accommodated
President Tsai Ing-wen's stopover in Hawaii last week, drawing protests
from China, which denounced the moves as "extremely dangerous."

Renewed US interest in Taiwan follows growing calls in Washington for a
"whole-of-government" effort to prevent China from surpassing American
military and industrial dominance.

Perhaps nowhere has the power shift been felt more than on Taiwan, an
island of 23.6 million people that China aims to eventually control
despite 70 years of divided rule.

China has directed its industrial strength toward huge investments in
military hardware over the past two decades, building a world-class navy
and filling its coastline with missiles capable of hitting Taiwanese
targets.

The country spent 23 times more than Taiwan on defence in 2017, up from
double in 1997.

New F-16s won't "change the fundamental balance of capabilities across
the strait, nor will it eliminate the threat that China poses to
forcibly absorb a democratic Taiwan," said Scott Harold, an associate
director of Rand Corp.'s Centre for Asia-Pacific Policy.

"Taiwan will continue to need to invest in missiles, electronic warfare,
mines and other advanced conventional and asymmetric capabilities
designed to deter, and if necessary defeat, any Chinese effort to use
coercion to compel unification," Harold said.

Rand analysts argued in a 2016 report that China's sophisticated
short-range ballistic missiles could "cut every runway at Taiwan's
half-dozen main fighter bases and destroy essentially all" parked
aircraft in a conflict.

Any planes that made it in the air could face Chinese pilots flying jets
such as the J-20, a "fifth-generation" stealth fighter considered to be
a rival to Lockheed's advanced F-22s and F-35s.

Still, **[the F-16 sale would represent a shift by the US, which is
obliged to sell "arms of a defensive character" to Taipei under the 1979
Taiwan Relations Act.]{.underline}**

Presidents since Bill Clinton have repeatedly rebuffed Taiwan's requests
for new fighter jets and other advanced weapons systems that could
provoke Beijing, with Barack Obama agreeing in 2011 to merely upgrade
its ageing F-16 fleet.

Tsai said during her visit to Hawaii on Wednesday that a fighter jet
deal would "greatly enhance our land and air capabilities, strengthen
military morale and show to the world the U.S.'s commitment to Taiwan's
defence."

The F-16Vs requested by Taiwan are promoted as the world's most advanced
fourth-generation jet, including the latest radar and avionics, even
though the original F16 model has been in service for more than 40
years.

The aircraft would help the island respond day-to-day incidents such as
air space incursions that fall short of open war and mop up data during
routine patrols.

**[China]{.underline}**, which suspended military exchanges with the US
in response to previous sales, **[protested the F-16
move]{.underline}**.

The foreign ministry said the country lodged "stern representations"
with US while **[the defence ministry warned against moves that undercut
the contention that the mainland and Taiwan are part of "one
China."]{.underline}**

"**[Any words or actions that undermine the one-China policy
are]{.underline}** tantamount to shaking the foundation of China-U. S.
relations, are inconsistent with the fundamental interests of China and
the United States and are also **[extremely dangerous]{.underline}**,"
Senior Colonel Wu Qian said at a briefing on Thursday in Beijing.

bhb

**[The United States and China appear to be heading toward a major
confrontation over the possible sale of American fighters to
Taiwan]{.underline}**.

Last week, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen confirmed that the country's
Ministry of Defense had submitted a formal request to Washington, D.C.,
to purchase F-16V Viper fighters. Tsai said the decision to make the
request was supported by a review of Taiwan's defense needs.

Days later, Bloomberg News reported that the White House was poised to
approve the Taiwanese request.

If that report is true, the United States would be turning course on
what has been a longstanding reluctance to sell fighters to Taiwan, even
as it has authorized other arms sales in line with the 1979 Taiwan
Relations Act, which requires the U.S. government to support Taiwan
"with arms of a defensive character."

Even as the Obama administration and the Trump administration have
approved weapons and spare parts for sale to Taiwan, **[fighters have
long been seen as a bridge too far]{.underline}** given Beijing serious
reservations.

**[The United States authorized the sale of 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan
in 1992]{.underline}**. The Obama administration, after receiving a
request from Taipei, turned it down, initiating a set of upgrades
instead to Taipei's existing fleet.

The issue hasn't gone unnoticed in China, where Taiwan is seen as an
inherent part of the country. Relations across the Taiwan Strait have
been particularly strained since Tsai's inauguration in 2016.

The Taiwanese president hails from the independence-leaning Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), though she herself has not explicitly supported
independence --- long a red-line for Beijing --- Tsai, however, has
refused to endorse the so-called "1992 consensus," which her predecessor
had supported and which forms what Beijing sees as the baseline for
cordial cross-strait relations.

"China's position to firmly oppose arms sales to Taiwan is consistent
and clear," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said
during a press briefing on Friday.

"We have made stern representations to the U.S. We have urged the U.S.
to fully recognize the sensitivity of this issue and the harm it will
cause."

**[The prospect of a fighter sale to Taiwan this time comes at a time of
particularly heightened U.S.-China tensions]{.underline}**. The Trump
administration has been known to seek leverage with Beijing across
issues and it is possible that this may turn into the latest case of
Taiwan being used a possible bargaining chip as Trump seeks to clinch a
favorable trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

**[Trump]{.underline}**, however, **[has been unconventional on Taiwan
policy in the past. As president-elect, he broke expectations by
receiving a telephone call from Tsai.]{.underline}** That call occurred
at a time when Trump had yet to endorse the United States' one-China
policy as president --- something that he did for the first time in
February 2017.

Either way, **[Tsai's fighter request and the Trump administration's
reported acceptance could set up another major area of turbulence
between the United States and China]{.underline}**.

#### China will retaliate -- perceives separatists seeking independence

**Liang** 6-13-**19** -- Lim Yan Liang is a China Correspondent for The
Straits Times ("China repeats warning to US against arms sale to
Taiwan," The Straits Times (Singapore), Nexis Uni) bhb

**[China has repeated its warning to the United States not to sell arms
to Taiwan]{.underline}**, and to stop interfering in China\'s internal
affairs.

Strongly opposing official exchanges and military ties between the US
and Taiwan, the spokesman for China\'s policymaking Taiwan Affairs
Office An Fengshan also said yesterday that any attempts at Taiwan
independence will meet a dead end.

Mr An\'s comments came after recent escalations in US-China tensions
that threaten to spill over beyond the ongoing trade war and into other
domains.

Reports last week said the US is pursuing a US\$2 billion (S\$2.72
billion) arms sale to Taiwan consisting of 108 Abrams tanks and a range
of portable anti-tank missiles, angering Beijing.

China\'s Foreign Ministry had slammed the proposed arms sale, which
would be the fourth such deal for Taiwan under President Donald Trump if
it is approved by Congress.

The proposed deal comes on the back of a US\$330 million sale of F-16
and other military aircraft parts last year, and an F-16 pilot training,
maintenance and logistics support programme worth some US\$500 million
that was approved in April.

Yesterday, **[Mr An reiterated the Foreign Ministry\'s call for the US
to sever military ties with Taiwan and to avoid upsetting stability in
the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}**

**[\"The situation in the Taiwan Strait is, at present, complicated and
serious, and the US should handle Taiwan-related issues with caution and
not send the wrong signals to \'Taiwan independence\' separatist
forces,\"]{.underline}** he said.

The Pentagon has in recent months increased the frequency of naval
patrols through the Taiwan Strait, in what officials call freedom of
navigation exercises.

Earlier this month, the US released its first Indo-Pacific Strategy
Report that included Taiwan on a list of those it called \"reliable,
capable and natural partners of the United States\".

Washington timed the release of the report with Acting US Defence
Secretary Patrick Shanahan\'s speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue in
Singapore, where he said the US would no longer \"tiptoe\" around
China\'s behaviour in Asia.

The US Pacific Marine Corps has since released photos of a Taiwanese
general at an annual gathering of military leaders in Hawaii last week.
The White House this month also posted on Instagram a photo of Mr Trump
with US Air Force Academy graduates, with the Taiwan flag visible on the
side.

**[China considers]{.underline}** self-governed **[Taiwan]{.underline}**
a renegade province with no right to state-to-state ties, and
**[territory to be \"reunified\" by force if necessary]{.underline}**.

Mr An did not directly answer whether China viewed these latest
developments as having breached its bottom line regarding the
mainland\'s \"one China\" principle, but said Taiwan is an inalienable
part of China.

**[China takes the position that there is one China]{.underline}**, with
each side having different interpretations of what \"one China\" means.

**[Mr An said China will not tolerate any attempt to divide the country,
and that Beijing \"reserves the option to take all necessary measures
targeting interference by external forces and the separatist activities
of a very small number of \'Taiwan independence\' separatist
forces\"]{.underline}**.

involve strong support from the United States, which means arms sales to
Taiwan almost certainly will continue to be a major irritant in
U.S.-China relations. Indeed, China can be expected not only to continue
lobbying against arms sales, but also to keep targeting U.S. political
support for Taiwan more generally. Even if further arms sales cannot tip
the cross-Strait military balance back in Taiwan's favor, **[Beijing can
be expected to continue to object vociferously whenever Washington sells
weapons to Taiwan. Chinese concerns focus at least as much on the
symbolism as they do on the substance of any particular
systems.]{.underline}** Additionally, **[China's relatively restrained
reaction to the latest Taiwan arms sales decision may not be indicative
of how Beijing would be likely to respond the next time around,
especially if future U.S. arms sales involve items that China sees as
symbols of U.S. political-military backing or if there are domestic
political or atmospheric changes in the U.S.-China-Taiwan strategic
triangle]{.underline}**.

### MPX -- UQ -- US Military Credibility Low

#### US can't credibly deter China in the Taiwan Strait -- Chinese A2/AD capabilities

**Gomez** 20**16** -- Eric Gomez is a policy analyst for defense and
foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. ("A Costly Commitment:
Options for the Future of the U.S.-Taiwan Defense Relationship,"

The U.S. defense relationship with Taiwan is a risky and costly
commitment that has become increasingly difficult to sustain. Barry
Posen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology put it best when he
wrote, "**[The U.S. commitment to Taiwan is simultaneously the most
perilous and least strategically necessary commitment that the United
States has today.]{.underline}**"1 The United States can and should
strive for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan dispute, but through
means other than an implicit commitment to use military force to defend
the island.

Washington's approach to keeping the peace in the Taiwan Strait during
the latter years of Taiwan's Lee Teng-hui (1988-2000) and most of the
Chen Shui-bian (2000---2008) administrations was known as "dual
deterrence." **[Under dual deterrence the United States issued a
combination of warnings and reassurances to both China and Taiwan to
prevent either from unilaterally changing the status
quo.]{.underline}**2 America's overwhelming military advantage over the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) deterred China from using military force,
while Taiwan moderated its behavior lest U.S. forces not come to its
rescue.3 However, **[the dual deterrence concept is ill-suited to the
current military environment in the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}**

**[Dual deterrence is no longer viable because]{.underline}** the
modernization of the PLA has improved Beijing's ability to inflict high
costs on U.S. military forces that would come to Taiwan's aid in the
event of a Chinese invasion attempt.4 The deployment of two U.S. Navy
aircraft carriers to the waters around Taiwan during the 1995-1996
Taiwan Strait Crisis was a major embarrassment for the PLA, and it has
played an important role in driving China's military modernization.5
**[Improvements in China's]{.underline}** anti-access/area denial
(**[A2/AD) capabilities have significantly complicated the ability of
the United States to defend Taiwan by making it difficult for the U.S.
Navy and Air Force to operate in and around the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline}**6 According to a recent RAND Corporation study, "a
Taiwan \[conflict\] scenario will be extremely competitive by 2017, with
China able to challenge U.S. capabilities in a wide range of areas."7
**[This shifting balance of power strains the credibility of the U.S.
defense commitment to Taiwan]{.underline}** by increasing the costs the
United States would have to pay in an armed conflict.

### AT China Invasion Turn

#### Ending arms sales will cause Taiwan to change its force posture to deter China asymmetrically

**[Instead of focusing on]{.underline}** these **[high-end
systems]{.underline}**, many **[U.S. analysts recommend]{.underline}**
that **[Taiwan invest in truly asymmetric capabilities that would raise
the price of an invasion for the]{.underline}** People's Liberation Army
(**[PLA]{.underline}**). **[These analysts typically agree that Taiwan
should focus on "flipping" the antiaccess challenge against China by
indigenously producing missiles for air and missile
defense]{.underline}**, midget submarines, swarms of unmanned systems,
and fast attack craft, **[as well as sabotage and insurgent operations
should PLA forces make it ashore]{.underline}**.

Several analysts have suggested the best option for Taiwan to counter
crossStrait aggression by the Chinese is the development of its own
antiaccess/area denial (A2/AD) capability. Eugene Gholz argues that
Taiwan is not as well suited to deploying an A2/AD capability that would
create a "no man's sea" between itself and a Chinese invasion as other
powers in the region might be. Taiwan is closer in proximity to China
than other countries that fear Chinese aggression, meaning the range of
their A2/AD systems would overlap.21 However, Taiwan's geography offers
some advantages. The island's size means that mobile systems can fire
and leave the scene---"shoot and scoot"---finding shelter in parts of
Taiwan's terrain that can provide concealment from Chinese missiles'
surveillance. According to Gholz, **[Taiwan already produces a mobile
antiship cruise missile that can provide the type of
capability]{.underline}** that he recommends. **[The problem is that
they have not been produced in sufficient numbers.]{.underline}**22

Other asymmetric capabilities that could aid in Taiwan's A2/AD strategy
include swarms of fast attack craft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
Colin Carroll and Rebecca Friedman Lissner argue that Taiwan should
adopt an asymmetric strategy for the Taiwan Strait similar to what Iran
has done in the Persian Gulf. This strategy would combine fast attack
craft swarms, cheap unarmed UAVs, improved camouflage and concealment,
and mobile surface-toair missiles to increase the cost of a PLA attempt
to control the sea and air space around Taiwan.23 **[Some of these
capabilities, such as cheap UAVs, may become easier to develop as 3D
printing technology advances.]{.underline}**24

The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA) goes even
further. In Hard ROC 2.0: Taiwan and Deterrence Through Protraction,
CSBA analysts argue that Taiwan should draw on principles from guerilla
warfare to deny the PLA sea and air control around the island. The aim
of this strategy would be the "virtual" and actual attrition of PLA
forces in the event of Chinese aggression. The analysis assumes air and
missile strikes, along with cyberattacks and a blockade, would be used
to break Taiwan's will or as prelude to an invasion.25 The guerrilla sea
and air campaign---and preparations for an insurgency should PLA forces
make it ashore---are meant to deter Chinese aggression by increasing its
cost and ensuring quick conquest of Taiwan would be impossible.26
Procurement priorities for Hard ROC 2.0 would include midget
\[miniaturized\] submarines, antiship cruise missiles, mines, mobile air
defenses of the Enhanced Sea Sparrow missile-class, truck-based
howitzers, and truck-mounted multi-launch rocket systems.27 Writing in
2014, the authors suggest that such a shift in emphasis would require
\$3 billion less than modernization efforts proposed at the time.28
Other priorities include preparing in case the PLA does make it ashore.
The authors recommend that Taiwan preposition guided rockets, artillery,
mortars, and missiles in major cities, with the army engaging in a
"Fabian defense" before "melting away" to begin a traditional guerrilla
campaign.29

Where the CSBA analysis differs most from the others, though, is in its
recommendation for potential strikes on China. These strikes would be
part of an effort to disrupt the PLA's "battle networks"---that is, its
command and control, communications, computers, intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) capabilities.30 The CSBA
authors suggest that the risks for potential escalation are worthwhile,
as the threat of disrupting the PLA's battle networks could be enough to
undermine Chinese war planners' confidence in a quick victory. Moreover,
they contend, concerns about escalation are in reference to a conflict
between the United States and China where the existence of the former is
not in doubt. **[In a conflict between Taiwan and China, however, Taiwan
has little to lose since its autonomy is already at
stake.]{.underline}**

Taken together, **[these]{.underline}** recommendations **[suggest a
radical departure from Taiwan's current acquisitions
priorities.]{.underline}** Each option represents **[a true shift to
asymmetric capabilities that would be more cost effective than relying
on highend platforms purchased from the United States.]{.underline}**
Still, as a number of analysts note, adopting these recommendations will
require significant training and doctrinal changes on the part of
Taiwan's armed forces. **[It will also require Taiwan to become more
self-reliant in defense production instead of continuing to wait on
purchases of U.S. weapon systems.]{.underline}** In many ways, these
changes will require Taiwan's military to rethink how it conceives of
its own identity as an institution.31

insurmountable**

Taiwan should be one of the most secure places on earth. It is a
flourishing liberal democracy that boasts a vibrant, globalized economy,
a well-educated population, and a high standard of living. Yet
**[Taiwan's future is anything but secure]{.underline}**. It is an
outlier in the international system---sovereign in practice, but not in
name. China regards it as a renegade province and systematically seeks
to isolate it from the rest of the world. More ominously, **[China has
not renounced the use of military force to resolve the
standoff.]{.underline}** Thus, instead of being safe and secure,
Taiwan's 23.5 million citizens are forced to live in the shadow of
unimaginable potential violence.

Whether or not China might someday attack Taiwan is a matter of much
debate. Whether or not Taiwan should take steps to convince Chinese
leaders that the costs of waging such a war will outweigh any possible
benefits is not. **[The more war becomes unacceptably painful, the more
likely both sides will endeavor to resolve their differences
peacefully]{.underline}**. In short, **[Taiwan must deter
aggression.]{.underline}**

This monograph suggests a holistic strategy that Taiwan can use to
enhance its conventional deterrence posture. Taiwan has thus far
followed a traditional approach to conventional deterrence, emphasizing
symmetric capabilities and decisive battles for control over air, land,
and sea. It still believes such a posture is effective because an attack
has yet to materialize. We agree that **[Taiwan's deterrence posture may
have worked in the past. However, the military balance is shifting, and
it is no longer obvious that Taiwan can afford to maintain qualitative
or quantitative parity with China]{.underline}**. Therefore, we argue
that **[Taiwan should]{.underline}** embrace a highly asymmetric,
elastic denial-in-depth posture. Instead of planning for decisive, set
piece battles, we recommend that Taiwan **[prepare its military and the
nation-at-large to wage a prolonged, asymmetric campaign against an
invading force. The goal is to deter by both raising the costs of
invasion and reducing the prospects for a quick victory]{.underline}**.

Chapter 1 introduces what we call Taiwan's deterrence trilemma. By this
term, we mean that given Taiwan's unique challenges, its conventional
deterrence strategy must simultaneously accomplish three goals:

• Counter grey zone provocations, which we define as the deliberate,
coordinated, and incremental use of provocations, incursions, and other
so-called "salami tactics" by conventional and unconventional military
forces so as to challenge existing red lines and establish new "facts on
the ground" without generating a decisive military response by the
target;

• Raise the costs of invasion; and

• Maintain low defense expenditures.

A trilemma exists, because these goals are in tension. A force posture
optimized to pursue one goal will likely exacerbate one or both of the
other two.

• To counter grey zone challenges, Taiwan must project symbolic strength
across its airspace and territorial waters. High-capability,
high-visibility air and naval platforms such as advanced fighter jets
and surface ships are often best at performing such tasks.

• To raise the costs of invasion, Taiwan needs forces that can survive
long enough---and fight well enough---to impose unacceptable losses on
China's forces.

• **[To avoid crowding out other important forms of government
spending]{.underline}**---including retirement benefits, healthcare, and
education---**[Taiwan cannot buy enough advanced aircraft and
ships,]{.underline}** which may be useful in the grey zone, **[so as to
prevent China from destroying most of them in the earliest stages of an
invasion, which undercuts its ability to deter China in the first
place]{.underline}**.

Chapter 1 also previews our proposed alternative: elastic
denial-in-defense. This approach consists of three core elements:

• Accept risk in the grey zone;

• Prioritize denial against the invasion threat; and

• Invest in popular resistance.

Chapter 2 assesses China's intentions. Scholars and policymakers may
debate whether or not China wants to challenge the existing
international order, but little disagreement exists about China's
intentions toward Taiwan. Put bluntly, China wants to assert political
control over the island. It certainly prefers to use peaceful means to
achieve this goal, but it has not taken force "off the table." Chapter 2
concludes by discussing Taiwan's perceptions of China's intentions. Yet
despite the unequivocal and nonnegotiable nature of China's attitude
toward Taiwan, the average Taiwan voter seems ambivalent about the risk
of war.

Chapter 3 examines the cross-Strait military balance. Instead of
focusing on comparative statistics, we instead explore China's ability
to carry out an invasion and Taiwan's ability to defend against one.
Specifically, we examine the degree to which the People's Liberation
Army (PLA) is prepared for the three main tasks it must accomplish to
successfully invade:

• A missile, aircraft, and cyber-strike to achieve air superiority by
destroying Taiwan's air force, degrading its defenses, disorganizing its
government, and potentially even breaking its will to fight;

• A naval blockade to isolate Taiwan politically and economically while
setting the conditions for invasion; and

• An amphibious assault across the Taiwan Strait to land large numbers
of ground units to establish and maintain political control over the
entire island.

We conclude that despite investing heavily in modernization,
reorganization, training, and doctrine, the PLA still faces a number of
important gaps that will complicate its ability to launch an invasion in
the near term. Like other experts, we believe that a surprise invasion
is virtually impossible. Nonetheless, time is on China's side. **[Trend
lines unambiguously indicate that Taiwan's military is falling behind
quantitatively and qualitatively. Taiwan's current force posture and
war-fighting doctrine are not well synchronized.]{.underline}** Worst of
all, despite rhetorically emphasizing asymmetry, **[Taiwan's current
approach seems more likely to pit strength against strength if war
actually breaks out. That is not a fight Taiwan will win. Deterrence may
suffer as a result]{.underline}**.

Chapters 4 and 5 describe our alternative deterrence posture
recommendations in detail. Chapter 4 identifies several reasons Taiwan
should accept risk in the grey zone. First, threats arising from grey
zone operations are not existential. Second, China operates in the grey
zone so as to avoid escalation. Completely eliminating the grey zone
might well push China toward more aggressive options. Third, Taiwan is
well within the range of China's long-range strike systems. The
characteristics that make conventional ships and fighter jets valuable
in grey zone contexts---high visibility and technological
capability---become liabilities in a war because China will
unquestionably target these weapons in the earliest stages of a
conflict. Moreover, **[because advanced conventional platforms are
expensive, Taiwan cannot afford large numbers of them]{.underline}**. As
a result, **[China will find it relatively easy to locate, target, and
destroy most of them]{.underline}** before they can "get into action."
Chapter 4 concludes by identifying ways that **[Taiwan can rebalance its
force to maintain "just enough" conventional capability to push back
against grey zone operations]{.underline}**. Cutting investment in the
Indigenous Defense Submarine (IDS) program, Aegis-like destroyers, and
the amphibious shipping force will yield more resources to invest in
truly asymmetric capabilities. Ultimately, Taiwan is better off
deterring a worst-case invasion---even if it means living with increased
grey zone incursions---than the other way around. And a military
optimized to counter grey zone threats will be particularly vulnerable
to an invasion scenario.

Chapter 5 provides a detailed overview of our elastic denial-in-depth
concept. This approach is built around an unconventional force posture
organized into four denial zones: air, sea, ground, and within society.
Denial implies imposing costs on an attacker instead of trying to
establish or maintain control of a given space, zone, or piece of
ground. Thus, **[instead of preparing to fight a decisive battle in the
air, at sea, or on the ground, Taiwan's forces should organize, train,
and equip to wage a prolonged series of fighting
withdrawals]{.underline}**. In the air and at sea, Taiwan should
complicate the strike campaign China must carry out in order to invade.
**[Taiwan can do so by acquiring large numbers of relatively low-cost,
dedicated counter-invasion capabilities, such as surface-to-air
missiles, missile boats, mini-submersibles, naval mines, drones, and
autonomous weapons]{.underline}**. On the ground, active duty army and
repurposed marine forces should prepare for longrange coastal defense,
counter-attack, and fighting retrograde missions. Finally, we suggest
that Taiwan begin serious planning for social denial. In practical
terms, Taiwan should restructure its massive reserve force so as to
prepare it to conduct a prolonged insurgency campaign in urban, jungle,
and mountain settings. To facilitate this end, we recommend transforming
Taiwan's Reserve Command into a Territorial Defense Force.

To understand the Trump administration\'s Taiwan policy, one needs to
pay more attention to the China-U.S. interactions in the triangular
structure. Despite the \"great chemistry\" between Donald Trump and
Chinese President Xi Jinping during the April 2017 summit that marked
the improvement of the bilateral relations, no one can exclude the
likelihood of another downturn in the years to come. Relying less on
multilateral architecture and international regime and more on bilateral
dealings and unilateral decisions, **[Trump\'s foreign policy is more
domestic-oriented, with a strong flavor of America first]{.underline}**.
Trump\'s embrace of populism and unilateralism has made scholars and
policy practitioners to think of him as his predecessor back to the
early 19th century, Andrew Jackson, the first populist president in
American history.60 As a \[End Page 195\] Jacksonian president, Trump\'s
priority is to shore up U.S. domestic economy instead of paying
asymmetrically for American global leadership. **[His intention to break
with traditional diplomatic norms also inevitably altered Asian
people\'s perception of the credibility of the United States\' threat of
force]{.underline}**. According to a Gallup World Poll survey conducted
in December 2016, while **[44 percent of Taiwanese believe that the
United States would provide military assistance if needed, 35 percent of
respondents hold the opposite beli]{.underline}**ef, with the rest
having different perceptions on the issue, in which 6 percent say
\"depends\" and 15 percent \"don\'t know\".61 **[The unpredictable Trump
administration has also brought implications for Taipei-Washington
relations. Since Washington has withdrawn from the]{.underline}**
regional economic architecture of the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(**[TPP]{.underline}**) **[and shown less concern about the human rights
issue, the Tsai administration\'s three-prong strategy of allying with
the United States in terms of economy, value, and security has lost two
legs]{.underline}**, highlighting the issue of sustainability of status
quo across the Taiwan Strait.

Indeed, **[U.S. policy to Taiwan has become less predictable since
President Trump came to office.]{.underline}** Many uncertainties, such
as the power struggle inside Trump\'s policy-making circle between the
nationalists and internationalists and the policy debates between the
hardline and moderate \[End Page 197\] Republicans, have resulted in the
unpredictability of Trump\'s policy to Beijing as well as Taipei.
However, against the backdrop of the ongoing wide-range U.S. debates
over Washington\'s China policy in academic and policy circles over the
policy of engagement and hedging, one cannot help but link the decisions
on Taiwan with U.S. intentions to balance against a rising China. In

### AT Tariff Alt Cause

#### Trade conflict is inevitable without resolving arms sales to Taiwan

**Lopez** 6-11-**19** -- Linette Lopez is the senior finance
correspondent at Business Insider ("Forget the trade war --- a bigger
conflict between the US and China is playing out right under our noses,"

**[The world has its eye on the trade war between the US and China, but
a more dangerous confrontation]{.underline}** between the two nations
**[is playing out]{.underline}** in the background: the worsening
disagreement over the \"One China\" policy.

Last week, Reuters reported that **[Washington]{.underline}** was on its
way to **[approving \$2 billion worth of arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}**. The move **[indicates]{.underline}** the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[isn\'t trying to create an
atmosphere conducive to trade negotiations and suggests that disputes
between the US and China are more likely headed toward escalation than
resolution]{.underline}**.

\"**[Taiwan is the thing the Chinese care most about hands
down]{.underline}**,\" said Susan Thornton, a former assistant US
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. \"**[Anything
where the US is interfering with Taiwan hits a national third
rail]{.underline}**.\"

The One China policy --- which asserts that Taiwan is not an independent
nation but rather part of China --- was developed during the Nixon
administration to improve US-China relations. The idea is central to
China\'s identity as a modern world power, and since President Donald
Trump took office the US has challenged that notion repeatedly.

Despite protests from Beijing, Trump signed the Taiwan Travel Act,
legislation permitting high-level talks between US and Taiwanese
officials, last year. In May, the US national security adviser, John
Bolton, met with David Lee, one of Taiwan\'s top security officials.
This meeting came just after Taiwan renamed its unofficial embassy in
Washington the Taiwan Council for US Affairs. The old name, the
Coordination Council for North American Affairs, neglected to mention
Taiwan or the US.

The Trump administration has also sold arms to Taiwan before, as have
previous administrations, but **[this \$2 billion arms sale digs at a
delicate wound during a delicate time. It\'s a big sale]{.underline}**,
even in a world where weapons are becoming more and more expensive. And
though it does not include the US\'s top fighter jets, **[it is sure to
antagonize Beijing]{.underline}** before the G20 meeting at the end of
the month in Osaka, Japan, where US and Chinese heads of state are
expected to meet.

On Thursday, **[a Chinese Foreign Ministry
representative]{.underline}**, Geng Shuang, **[responded]{.underline}**
to the news of the arms sale with a **[warning]{.underline}**, according
to the Chinese state media outlet Xinhua.

\"We urge **[the US]{.underline}** side **[to stop arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}** and sever their military ties, prudently and
properly handle Taiwan-related issues, to avoid serious damage to
China-US relations as well as to the peace and stability of the Taiwan
Strait,\" Geng said.

Last week, the Trump administration responded to the Taiwanese
president's request for some of the biggest weapons made in the U.S.,
saying he was fine with the order.

The formal request still needs congressional approval. Beijing will
lobby hard against it before Trump and Xi meet. No meeting date has been
set.

**[Taiwan's request is an unwelcome risk for ongoing U.S. China

### Arms Sales K2 Relations

#### Arm sales increasing and harming relations

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - **[The United States is pursuing the sale of more
than \$2 billion worth of tanks and weapons to Taiwan, four people
familiar with the negotiations said, sparking anger from Beijing which
is already involved in an escalating trade war with
Washington.]{.underline}** An informal notification of the proposed sale
has been sent to the U.S. Congress, the four sources said on condition
of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the
possible deal. The potential sale included 108 General Dynamics Corp
M1A2 Abrams tanks worth around \$2 billion as well as anti-tank and
anti-aircraft munitions, three of the sources said. Taiwan has been
interested in refreshing its existing U.S.-made battle tank inventory,
which includes M60 Patton tanks. **[The United States is the main arms
supplier to Taiwan, which China deems its own and has never renounced
the use of force to bring the self-ruled island under its
control.]{.underline}** Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said in March
Washington was responding positively to Taipei's requests for new arms
sales to bolster its defenses in the face of pressure from China. **[The
United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help
provide it with the means to defend itself. China and the United States
are engaged in a fierce trade war, with clashes over Taiwan and the
South China Sea exacerbating tensions.]{.underline}** A spokesman for
the State Department, which oversees foreign military sales, said the
U.S. government does not comment on or confirm potential or pending arms
sales or transfers before they have been formally notified to Congress.
The congressional notifications included a variety of anti-tank
munitions, including 409 Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Corp-made
Javelin missiles worth as much as \$129 million, two of the sources
said. The notifications also included 1,240 TOW anti-tank missiles worth
as much as \$299 million, one of the sources said. There were also 250
stinger missiles worth as much as \$223 million in the notification, the
source said. Stingers are often used in portable anti-aircraft weapons
systems. **[Taiwan's Defense Ministry confirmed it had requested those
weapons and that the request was proceeding normally.]{.underline}** The
U.S. commitment to providing Taiwan with the weapons to defend itself
helps Taiwan's military to raise its combat abilities, consolidates the
Taiwan-U.S. security partnership and ensures Taiwan's security, the
ministry said in a statement. The Chinese government condemned the
planned sale. Slideshow (2 Images) "We are severely concerned about the
U.S. move and are firmly against U.S. arms sales to Taiwan," Foreign
Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing in Beijing.
**[China urges the United States to stop arms sales to Taiwan and
prudently deal with issues relating to Taiwan to prevent harm to
bilateral relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait,]{.underline}** he added. CHINA HAWK **[U.S. President Donald
Trump's administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms
export policy in 2018 aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it
would bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at
home.]{.underline}** Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro was one of the
administration's architects of that policy. Navarro, a China hawk, wrote
about the possible sale of tanks to Taiwan in a March opinion column in
the New York Times ahead of a presidential trip to the Lima, Ohio, plant
where they are made. At a low point, the U.S. Army had only one tank
coming from the plant a month, General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic said
during an April conference call with investors, but said "we'll be
rolling out 30 tanks a month by the end of this year," partly because of
international orders. The Pentagon announced last week it would sell 34
ScanEagle drones, made by Boeing Co, to the governments of Malaysia,
Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam for \$47 million. The drones
would afford greater intelligence-gathering capabilities, potentially
curbing Chinese activity in the region. China claims almost all of the
strategic South China Sea and frequently lambastes the United States and
its allies over naval operations near Chinese-occupied islands. Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam all have
competing claims. China's Defense Minister Wei Fenghe warned the United
States at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore last weekend not to
meddle in security disputes over Taiwan and the South China Sea. Acting
U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told the meeting that the United
States would no longer "tiptoe" around China's behavior in Asia.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry, responding to the Reuters report of planned
the new arms sale, said Wei's "threatening" comments and recent Chinese
military drills near Taiwan showed the importance of its need to
strengthen its defensive abilities. "Going forward our government will
continue to deepen the close security partnership between Taiwan and the
United States," it said.

BEIJING, April 17 (Xinhua) \-- **[The U.S. arms sale plan unveiled
Monday is a dangerous move that will only aggravate the already complex
and grim situation across the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}** **[The U.S.
government has approved a possible 500-million-U.S. dollar military sale
to Taiwan]{.underline}**, claiming that the move will help to improve
the security and defensive capability of the recipient. Subsequently,

sale was \"timely.\" **[The situation across the Taiwan Strait, which is
already complicated and grim, is worsening as the United States has been
using Taiwan to contain China]{.underline}** while the Taiwan
administration kept seeking foreign intervention. **[The Taiwan question
concerns China\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity and is the most
important and sensitive issue in China-U.S. relations. The U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan constitutes a serious violation of international law,
the basic norms governing international relations, the one-China
principle and the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and undermine
China\'s sovereignty and security interests.]{.underline}** China\'s
firm opposition to such arms sales is consistent and firm. **[Since the
current U.S. administration took office, it has constantly played the
\"Taiwan card\" to contain China, especially in arms sales to Taiwan and
military exchanges between the United States and Taiwan]{.underline}**.
**[This has seriously damaged China-U.S. relations and jeopardized peace
and stability]{.underline}** **[across the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}**
The Taiwan question, which concerns China\'s core interests and the
national bond of the Chinese people, brooks no external interference.
The U.S. administration has once again stirred up sensitive nerves in
the Taiwan Strait. **[Its gross interference in China\'s internal
affairs has aroused the strong indignation of the Chinese people on both
sides of the Strait.]{.underline}** Some Taiwan organizations and people
protested outside the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) in Taipei,
**[condemning U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and demanding \"no war, only
peace,\" and \"Taiwan is not a pawn for the United
States.\"]{.underline}** Therefore, we would like to advise the U.S.
side to clearly recognize the high sensitivity and serious harm of arms
sales to Taiwan, correct mistakes, honor its commitments and handle
Taiwan-related issues in a prudent and proper manner in accordance with
the one-China principle and the provisions of the three Sino-U.S. joint
communiques. **[Taiwan\'s current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration, which is teetering on the brink of collapse, was
overjoyed at the U.S. arms sales]{.underline}** as if it had been given
a \"straw to save its life.\" Tsai Ing-wen and **[the DPP administration
have escalated provocations against the Chinese mainland]{.underline}**,
created disturbances recently and cooperated with the United States in
vigorously clamoring the so-called \"military threat\" from the
mainland. In the face of next year\'s general election on the island,
**[Tsai and the DPP will not hesitate to let Taiwan serve as a pawn for
forces of external interference in order to protect their
power]{.underline}**, regardless of the safety and well-being of the
Taiwanese people. This party has not only misjudged the situation but
also deviated from the people\'s heart. **[U.S. weapons cannot guarantee
Taiwan\'s security.]{.underline}** Tsai and the DPP cannot secure their
power and position by seeking foreign interference or threatening the
people. Tsai, the DPP **[and \"Taiwan independence\" separatist elements
should not play with fire or even think about it. They are doomed to be
alone in the face of the pressure of their own actions.]{.underline}**
On April 17, 124 years ago, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed,
securing foreigner\'s occupation of Taiwan for half a century. It left
lasting, painful memories for all Chinese. Today\'s China will never
allow the historical tragedy of national division to repeat itself.
**[No one and no force should underestimate the determination and
capability of the Chinese in safeguarding national sovereignty and

reported in December that U**[.S. policy toward China has shifted "from
engagement to confrontation,"]{.underline}** and The Diplomat noted in
January that that Washington\'s "new consensus" is for "strategic
competition" with Beijing. The opening sentence of the Worldwide Threat
Assessment issued by U.**[S. Intelligence Agencies January 29 names
"China and Russia" (in that order) as the most prominent source of
"threats to U.S. national security."]{.underline}** Michael Klare,
long-time left analyst of world affairs and professor emeritus of peace
and world security studies at Hampshire College, argued in February that
"for all intents and purposes, the U.S. and China are already at war
with one another."

Why is this happening? And what can U.S. peace and justice activists do
to push the U.S.-China relationship in a different direction? Below we
explore these questions in hopes of sparking more debate within the
left. We offer these thoughts not as "China experts," which we are not,
but as anti-racist and anti-militarist activists who believe it is
urgent to demand that diplomacy replace economic and military
confrontation in U.S.-China relations, with the ultimate aim of forging
the international partnership necessary to take effective action against
catastrophic climate change.

The first is China\'s dramatic economic growth and steadily heightened
technological and military capacity since its turn toward "reform and
modernization" in the post-Mao era. China is now the second largest
economy in the world and, by some measures, is predicted to surpass the
United States as number one in 10 to 20 years.

The second is the determination by U.S. capital to maintain its global
hegemony by any means necessary even as its relative weight in an
increasingly multi-polar global economy declines. We saw this expressed
in the "pivot to Asia" policy under President Barack Obama, in response
to China\'s rise as the most powerful "peer competitor" to the United
States since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Beijing\'s struggle to control economic development

Back in the late 1970s, Washington took a positive stance toward
China\'s new economic policies, and was thrilled that Beijing signed on
to its Cold War crusade against the USSR. U.S. capitalists participated
deeply in China\'s post-Mao economic reforms, particularly after the
nature of those reforms changed in the 1990s. As Carl Walter and Fraser
Howie describe in Red Capitalism, the Chinese Communist Party sought in
that decade to remake the state-owned enterprises that anchored China\'s
non-rural economy. U.S. investment banks helped restructure those
enterprises so that they functioned more like corporations that could
compete in international markets. China also rapidly developed export
industries based largely in the "special economic zones" open to
overseas investment beginning in the 1980s. Those industries found a
market in the United States, where neoliberal economic policy was---with
a few years\' exception---producing wage stagnation and a corresponding
appetite for low-priced goods.

Not coincidentally, by the 1990s, U.S. elites largely supported the
strategy of constructive engagement with China. In 2000, the Clinton
administration gave China \'Most Favored Nation\' status and supported
its entry into the World Trade Organization. The then-dominant view
within the U.S. capitalist class was that China\'s moves toward economic
liberalization would necessarily bring political liberalization and
incorporation of China into a U.S.-led economic and geopolitical order.

Although U.S. capitalists unquestionably benefited from China\'s
economic reforms---think, for instance, of the profits reaped by
Apple---the Chinese government was able to set several conditions on
overseas investment. The huge size of the Chinese market and the grip of
the Communist Party on economic policy gave China almost unique leverage
in dealing with foreign capital. Writing for Foreign Policy in August
2018, Jake Werner pointed out that China\'s alleged "cheating" is more
accurately characterized as using its considerable muscle in a
U.S.-dominated global economy that is at bottom a "rigged game":

The huge and rapidly growing China market convinced major foreign
corporations to invest on terms negotiated with the state rather than
unilaterally imposing their own conditions, as they did with
manufacturing in Latin America or extractive industries in Africa. Most
prominently, China required foreign corporations entering the domestic
market to participate in joint ventures with Chinese companies, which
allowed domestic firms to learn the managerial and technological
practices of the developed world. China also established regulations
that secure favorable terms for Chinese enterprises licensing the
technologies of foreign firms.

While the issues of trade balances and tariffs get media attention, U.S.
elites\' economic grievances against China are largely based on
Beijing\'s continued restrictions on international capital, as
highlighted by Werner. This has influenced the leadership of both
Democratic and Republican parties, who apparently are preparing to
criticize an anticipated settlement of the trade war as too soft,
because it does not eliminate Chinese regulations.

All of this comes on top of U.S. capitalists\' unease about the
possibility that Chinese companies will outpace the United States in
technological innovation. Huawei has been in the spotlight recently
because the United States pressed Canada to arrest one of its executives
on charges that the company deceived U.S. banks into violating sanctions
on Iran. But this is largely a pretext. Huawei is mainly a source of
concern because it has been at the forefront of 5G wireless
communications, which is widely seen as crucial to the development of
new artificial intelligence technology and the military innovations that
will depend on it.

China has indeed integrated into the global economy, but it has managed
to do so on its own terms as much as those set by the United States
Rather than becoming increasingly subordinate to Washington, Beijing has
been able to maintain considerable independence and economic initiative.

China flexes its geopolitical muscle

As China\'s economic clout has increased, its capacity to take political
initiative and develop its military strength has grown as well. Over the
last decade especially, Beijing has increasingly flexed its muscle on
the regional and international stage.

In Southeast Asia, this has been clearest in the long-simmering tensions
over the South China Sea, which some term the West Philippine Sea.
Several countries, including the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Vietnam, oppose China\'s claim of sovereignty over the
strategically crucial and oil-rich waterway. The Philippines brought its
case before an international tribunal at the Hague and secured a
favorable verdict, but China refused to participate in the proceedings
and has rejected the ruling. In the meantime, China has upped its
military presence in the disputed area. It has constructed new airstrips
and military installations, sometimes accomplishing this by enlarging
the size of islands it controls and creating entirely new islands. The
United States, for its part, has conducted provocative naval maneuvers
both in the South China Sea and in the Strait of Taiwan. Here, the
postwar U.S. view of the Pacific as the American Lake collides with
China\'s determination to control a location that could---if push comes
to shove---serve as a strategic chokepoint for China\'s energy imports.

Globally, China has spearheaded the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a
massive infrastructure development project encompassing 70 countries.
The goal is to create six different "economic corridors" that would
integrate economies across Europe, Africa, and Asia with each other and,
of course, with China. The scope of this initiative is so vast that some
have compared it to the Marshall Plan, which funded the reconstruction
of Western Europe after World War II, but on a global scale. The
physical environment of the world will be utterly transformed, as the
BRI finances "bridges, railways, pipelines, hydroelectric dams,
highways, power grids" on a massive scale. Crucially, the key financial
drivers of the BRI are Chinese-led and multilateral banks that are not
dominated by the United States, such as the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank and the BRICS New Development Bank. In Latin America,
Chinese banks have provided \$140 billion dollars in loans in the last
decade. As the BRI looks to expand to Latin America, we can expect
ever-deeper connection between the Latin American and Chinese economies.

Like any economic initiative on this scale, the BRI has big geopolitical
implications. Presently, China\'s economy depends on the U.S. consumers.
This is one reason some scholars feel China is ultimately hemmed into a
U.S.-led economic and political order. The BRI will allow China to
dramatically reduce its dependence on the U.S. consumer market.
Simultaneously, it gives other smaller and weaker countries more
leverage in dealings with Western capital: They now have an alternative
direction to turn for investment and trade, even as many grapple with
concerns about negative effects of a large Chinese presence in their
economies. These two developments represent a growing threat to U.S.
dominance: China not only weakens a main source of Washington\'s current
leverage over its policies but gains the potential to anchor an
alignment of many countries in counter-balancing U.S. power.

Washington\'s goal of "overmatch"

During the post-9/11 years, Washington was preoccupied with the
so-called "War on Terror" and its disastrous wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq. When the U.S. foreign policy and military establishment came up
for air to take stock under Obama, their consensus was they were behind
the curve in assessing where the most serious threat to U.S. global
hegemony really lay. The result was Washington\'s "pivot to Asia" and,
more recently, the explicit turn in China policy from a engagement to
confrontation. Michael Klare describes the result:

**[Even before Donald Trump entered the Oval Office, the U.S. military
and other branches of government were already gearing up for a long-term
quasi-war, involving both growing economic and diplomatic pressure on
China and a buildup of military forces along that country's periphery.
Since his arrival, such initiatives have escalated into Cold War-style
combat]{.underline}** by another name with his administration committed
to defeating China in a struggle for global economic, technological, and
military supremacy.

As it wages this struggle, Washington has some powerful weapons to
deploy. A key one is its economic ace card: the special status of the
U.S. dollar in the world economy. But this status is thoroughly
interwoven with U.S. military might. The combination is aptly described
by Ho-fung Hung in The China Boom:

Although the U.S. share of the global economy and its political
influence around the world have been dwindling since the 1970s, its
residual geopolitical dominance has been sustained by the continuous
hegemonic status of the U.S. dollar in the international monetary
system. This continuing status enables the United States to borrow
internationally at low interest rates so that Americans are able not
only to live but also to fight beyond their means. The perpetuation of
the dollar\'s hegemony since the abolition of the gold standard in 1971
has been supported by the U.S. military\'s global supremacy.

Concerning military supremacy, **[the Trump administration makes no
secret of its fundamental goal]{.underline}**. The first comprehensive
statement of the administration\'s doctrine, the National Security
Strategy document released in December 2017, gave it a catch-phrase
title: **["overmatch," defined as overwhelming capabilities "in
sufficient scale to prevent enemy success and to ensure America\'s sons
and daughters will never be in a fair fight."]{.underline}**

"**[Overmatch" is already more than words on paper. In January, the
first in a new generation of U.S. nuclear weapons rolled off the
assembly line]{.underline}**. As James Carroll wrote in February for The
Nation, "Fulfilling the Trump administration's quest for
nuclear-war-fighting \'flexibility,\' it isn't designed as a deterrent
against another country launching its nukes; **[it's designed to be
used]{.underline}**. This is the weapon that could make the previously
\'unthinkable\' thinkable." **[Washington is simultaneously upping its
cyberwarfare capacitie]{.underline}**s. Although the cyber-conflict with
Russia gets more headlines, it\'s noteworthy that Vice President Mike
Pence declared last October, "What the Russians are doing pales in
comparison to what China is doing." In the proposed budget **[Trump sent
to Congress last week, he called for a 5 percent increase in military
spending]{.underline}**---even more than the Pentagon had
requested---while demanding big cuts in domestic programs like education
and environmental protection.

Dangers and prospects

**[To say all this is dangerous is an understatement.]{.underline}** The
costs of a ramped-up trade war would fall hardest on the working classes
in both U.S. and China---and if it leads to a global downturn, on
workers and the poor across the globe. Calls to "get tough on China"
are, at bottom, ways of shifting blame for people\'s economic woes away
from the U.S. corporate elite. As Tobita Chow explained in July for In
These Times, they tap into and reinforce the anti-Chinese racism long
present in U.S. politics and marginalize even the idea of solidarity
between workers in both countries. **[And the multi-front Cold War
described by Michael Klare means constant tension, with the very real
danger that an initially small flashpoint conflict could escalate into
full-scale, even nuclear, war]{.underline}**. **[Short of short open
conflict, constant tension between Washington and Beijing increases the
influence of nationalism, militarism and authoritarianism in both
countrie]{.underline}**s**[, which almost inevitably translates into
increases in domestic repression of popular movements, as well as
austerity.]{.underline}**

What does all this mean for the left? There are important debates on the
nature of China\'s social system and the impact of its geopolitical and
global economic strategies. But regardless of one\'s position in those
debates, the U.S. left has a critical role to play in galvanizing
opposition to the growing clamor for confrontation in U.S.-China
relations. We can do this. But we need a vision and practice that speaks
to both humanity\'s common interest in sheer survival and the global
working class\' interest in a just and non-exploitative society.

**[We should prioritize the fight for a 180-degree turnaround in the
U.S. stance toward China, demanding that diplomacy and negotiation
replace trade wars and military encirclement]{.underline}**. **[We
should call for a switch from the goal of "containing China" to the goal
of forging a U.S. China partnership that would take common action
against climate change]{.underline}** **[and support a global campaign
to address extreme poverty worldwide]{.underline}**. **[This
China-focused effort would be one component of a campaign to de-escalate
all global conflicts, and turn to diplomacy over military
force]{.underline}**. Such a campaign should push the U.S. government to
abandon pursuit of hegemony in favor or acceptance of the fact that we
all live in a multi-polar world where, as Martin Luther King declared in
1983, "We must learn to live together as brothers \[sic\] or perish
together as fools."

**[Making progress on this front will be a challenge]{.underline}**, not
least because of the barrage of punditry and dominant media framing
about China, which focuses exclusively on (often legitimate) grievances
and problems---and presents a one-sided picture of a complex society. On
top of this, the Trump-dominated GOP and anti-China Democrats are the
ones with the most clout on U.S.-China relations.

**[Despite these obstacles, there is a basis for building a broad-front
campaign to redirect U.S.-China relations for the sake of the planet and
its inhabitant]{.underline}**s. Such a campaign\'s demands would be
consistent with the principle of the Green New Deal on a global scale,
would recognize that the United States and China are the world\'s
largest emitters of carbon dioxide---China due to the size of its
population, the United States due to its per-capita pollution levels.
**[A successful international effort to avert catastrophic climate
change depends on joint action by the two countries.]{.underline}**

Within all working-class and social justice movements, it's vital to
bring internationalism and anti-racism to the fore and stress how a
decrease in tensions between states sets more favorable conditions for
democratic rights struggles and working-class movements in all
countries. An important part of this effort is forging direct ties
between workers in the United States and those in China, as well as
other countries. The last few years have seen a crackdown on independent
labor organizing under Xi Jinping and fewer chances for international
worker-to-worker interaction. But their common interests remain: Both
U.S. and Chinese workers confront many of the same transnationals. And
because Beijing\'s crackdown is directly connected to greater tensions
with Washington and fears that the United States will try to take
advantage of protests in China to undermine the Chinese government---as
the United States has done in so many other countries---fighting to
reduce U.S.-China tensions will ultimately benefit Chinese workers.

Gaining ground here is obviously a difficult process. But in the context
of a surging resistance to Trumpism that includes newly combative layers
of workers and a growing socialist contingent, possibilities exist that
were unimaginable even five years ago.

We don\'t have time to waste. Towards the end of the U.S.-USSR Cold War,
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev called for "a new way of thinking"
whereby all countries, despite major ideological and political
differences, would recognize that our collective security was imperiled
by the threat of nuclear war, environmental devastation and violence
produced by the extreme impoverishment of hundreds of millions of
people. Gorbachev\'s call for common action against those threats was
overwhelmed by the failure of his attempt to restructure Soviet society,
as well as by the wave of capitalist triumphalism and U.S. aggression
following the Soviet collapse. But all those dangers remain. **[Indeed,
we are 30 years further down the road toward climate catastrophe, global
inequality is greater than it was in the 1980s, and Washington is now
producing nuclear weapons that are more likely to be used than ever. And
this time, it is the U.S.-China relationship which will largely decide
what path humanity takes.]{.underline}**

Carbon pools in permafrost regions represent a large reservoir
vulnerable to change in a warming climate. While some of this carbon
will continue to persist in soils and sediments over the long term, our
understanding that a substantial fraction of this pool is susceptible to
microbial breakdown once thawed has been verified at the landscape scale
(Box 1 and the Box 1 Figure). The exponential nature of microbial
decomposition and CO2 and CH4 release over time means that the initial
decades after thaw will be the most important for greenhouse gas release
from any particular unit of thawed soil. [Our expert judgement is that
**estimates made by independent approaches, including laboratory
incubations, dynamic models, and expert assessment, seem to be
converging on,5%--15% of the terrestrial permafrost carbon pool being
vulnerable to release** in the form of greenhouse gases **during this
century** under the current warming trajectory, **with CO2-carbon
comprising the majority of the release.**]{.underline} There is
uncertainty, but the vulnerable fraction does not appear to be twice as
high or half as much as 5%--15%, based on this analysis. [Ten per cent
of the known terrestrial permafrost carbon pool is equivalent to
,130--160 Pg carbon. **That amount**, if released primarily in the form
of CO2 at a constant rate over a century, **would make it similar** in
magnitude **to other** historically important **biospheric
sources**]{.underline}, such as land use change (0.9 6 0.5 Pg carbon per
year; 2003--2012 average), **[but far less than fossil-fuel
emissions]{.underline}**88 (9.7 6 0.5 Pg carbon per year in 2012).
Considering CH4 as a fraction of permafrost carbon release would
increase the warming impact of these emissions. [At these rates, **the
observed and projected emissions of CO2 and CH4 from thawing permafrost
are unlikely to occur at a speed that could cause abrupt climate
change**]{.underline} over a period of a few years to a decade1,9. [**A
large pulse release** of permafrost carbon on this timescale c**ould
cause climate change that would incur catastrophic costs** to society8 ,
**but there is little evidence from either current observations or model
projections to support such a** large and rapid **pulse**. Instead,
**permafrost carbon emissions are likely to occur over decades and
centuries** as the permafrost region warms]{.underline}, making climate
change happen even faster than we project on the basis of emissions from
human activities alone. Because of momentum in the system and the
continued warming and thawing of permafrost, permafrost carbon emissions
are likely not only during this century but also beyond. Although never
likely to overshadow emissions from fossil fuel, each additional ton of
carbon released from the permafrost region to the atmosphere will
probably incur additional costs to society.

### Warming Bad -- AT: Adaptation

#### Adaptation fails -- only mitigation averts worst consequences and extinction

Introduction **[Humanity is rapidly extracting and burning fossil fuels
without full understanding of the consequences]{.underline}**. Current
assessments place emphasis on practical effects such as increasing
extremes of **[heat waves]{.underline}**, **[droughts]{.underline}**,
**[heavy rainfall]{.underline}**, **[floods]{.underline}**, and
**[encroaching]{.underline}** 5 **[seas]{.underline}** (IPCC, 2014;
USNCA, 2014). These assessments and our recent study (Hansen et al.,
2013a) conclude that **[there is an urgency to slow carbon
dioxide]{.underline}** (CO2) **[emissions, because the longevity of the
carbon in the climate system]{.underline}** (Archer, 2005) **[and
persistence of the induced warming]{.underline}** (Solomon et al., 2010)
**[may lock in unavoidable]{.underline}** highly undesirable
**[consequences.]{.underline}** 10 Despite these warnings, global CO2
emissions continue to increase as fossil fuels remain the primary energy
source. **[The argument is made]{.underline}** that it is economically
and morally responsible to continue fossil fuel use for the sake of
raising living standards, with expectation **[that humanity can
adapt]{.underline}** to climate change **[and]{.underline}** find ways
to **[minimize effects via advanced tech]{.underline}**nologies. 15 We
suggest that **[this]{.underline}** viewpoint **[fails to appreciate the
nature of the threat posed by ice sheet instability and sea level
rise]{.underline}**. If the ocean continues to accumulate heat and
increase melting of marine-terminating ice shelves of Antarctica and
Greenland, **[a point will be reached at which it is impossible to avoid
large scale ice sheet disintegration with sea level rise of at least
several meters]{.underline}**. The economic and social cost of losing 20
functionality of all coastal cities is practically incalculable. We
suggest that **[a strategic approach relying on
adaptation]{.underline}** to such consequences **[is unacceptable
to]{.underline}** most of **[humanity]{.underline}**, so it is important
to understand this threat as soon as possible.

### Plan 🡪 Reciprocity

#### Concessions on arms sales will induce a spiral of reciprocity with China

**[America's security commitment to Taiwan faces a significant test.
China's growing power presents a challenge to U.S. military superiority,
while Taiwan's investment in its own defense has
languished.]{.underline}** Adding to the challenge of keeping peace in
the Taiwan Strait is the shifting political situation in Taiwan,
exemplified by the January 2016 elections in which voters rejected the
cross-strait rapprochement policies of the Kuomintang (KMT) and turned
over control of the presidency and legislature to the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP). The China-Taiwan relationship has remained
relatively calm, but **[changes in the U.S.-China balance of power could
make the Taiwan Strait a dangerous place once more if the implicit U.S.
defense commitment to Taiwan loses credibility.]{.underline}**

This paper outlines three broad policy options for the United States:
shoring up the defense commitment by restoring military superiority over
China; sustaining a minimum level of military advantage over China; or
stepping down from the commitment to use military force to maintain
Taiwan's de facto independence. It concludes that the United States
should step down from the defense commitment eventually, ideally through
an incremental and reciprocal process with China that would draw
concessions from Beijing. In the long term, the U.S. security commitment
to Taiwan is neither beneficial nor advantageous for the United States.
Taiwan will have to take responsibility for its own defense.

**[Stepping down from the]{.underline}** implicit **[commitment
to]{.underline}** come to **[Taiwan]{.underline}**'s rescue with
military force **[carries risks, but other options leave the United
States worse off in the long term. The likely damage to U.S.-Chinese
relations caused by pushing for military superiority in the region
outweighs the benefits. Sustaining a minimum level of military advantage
is possible, but]{.underline}** absent a long-term economic slowdown
and/or political changes in China---both of which are beyond U.S.
control---maintaining **[such an advantage in perpetuity will be
difficult. Stepping down from the commitment through a long-term process
would give Taiwan the time it needs to make necessary changes in its
defense technology and military strategy.]{.underline}** Peace in the
Taiwan Strait is an important American interest, but it must be weighed
against the difficulty of maintaining credibility and the growing costs
of deterrence failure.

### AT Improve US Hard Power CP

#### TURN -- Improving military capabilities harms relations

**Gomez** 20**16** -- Eric Gomez is a policy analyst for defense and
foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute. ("A Costly Commitment:
Options for the Future of the U.S.-Taiwan Defense Relationship,"

**[Restoring U.S. military superiority would]{.underline}** shore up the
credibility of the American commitment to Taiwan at the
**[cost]{.underline}** of **[severe damage to the U.S.-China
relationship. China]{.underline}** might be deterred from attacking
Taiwan, but it **[would have ample reason to strongly oppose the United
States across other issue areas, including the South China Sea, trade
issues, and reining in North Korea]{.underline}**. Additionally,
unequivocal American support would reduce incentives for Taiwan to
improve its defenses.

The most important negative consequence of restoring U.S. military
superiority is the severe damage that would be done to U.S.-China
relations. China and the United States do not see eye-to-eye on many
issues, but this does not make China an outright adversary.68 Chinese
cyber espionage against American companies, the rise of alternative
development institutions led by Beijing, and island-building in the
South China Sea are of great concern to policymakers in Washington.69
However, **[U.S.-Chinese cooperation on other pressing issues,
especially environmental concerns and punishing North Korea after its
recent nuclear tests, has supported U.S. goals.]{.underline}**70 China
is certainly not a friend or ally of the United States, but treating it
as an enemy that needs to be contained is unwise.71 **[Restoring U.S.
military superiority would set back much of the progress made in
U.S.-China relations]{.underline}**.

#### TURN -- Improving military capabilities makes war more likely

**[Restoring U.S. military superiority might be a boon to America's
credibility in the short term, but superiority may be
fleeting.]{.underline}** **[The growing U.S. military presence in East
Asia]{.underline}**, a result of the Obama administration's "pivot" or
"rebalance" to the region, **[has exacerbated the Chinese perception of
the United States as a threat.]{.underline}**72 **[Restoring U.S.
military superiority will likely support this perception and provide a
strong incentive for China to invest even more resources in its
military.]{.underline}** Additionally, **[falling behind in the
conventional balance of power could prompt China to increase the
quantity and quality of its nuclear weapon arsenal.]{.underline}**73 If
Beijing quickly offsets the advantages of stronger U.S. military support
for Taiwan, the United States could end up in a similar position to the
one it's in now, but with a stronger China to deter.

*Asian Survey* Vol. 45 No. 6) bhb

Perhaps **[the most dangerous issue is China's perception that Taiwan's
leaders are using salami tactics to push toward independence without
crossing Beijing's red lines]{.underline}**. Beijing has condemned each
of Taiwan's actions but has been reluctant to repeat the military
responses it employed in 1995--96. If Taiwan leaders conclude that they
can continue to move toward independence because the costs to China of
using force are too high, **[Beijing may eventually feel the need to
take military action to send a clear signal that independence is
unacceptable. This would most likely involve a carefully limited use of
force, but it might escalate into a full-scale war that would involve
the United States.]{.underline}** More generally, **[the mismatch
between perceived adverse trends and available policy instruments could
prompt leaders to take risky actions because they lack alternative means
to address growing threats]{.underline}**.

#### No Solvency -- salami tactics are the status quo

**Thim** 20**18** -- Michal Thim is a Taiwan analyst at the Prague-based

problems for China,"
https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/asia/article/2166594/behind-us-smaller-arms-package-taiwan-lie-bigger)
bhb

**[China's foreign ministry]{.underline}** spokesperson Geng Shuang
**[denounced the sale as a breach of China's sovereignty and demanded an
end to US-Taiwan arms sales]{.underline}**. Needless to say, Taiwan has
praised the decision and thanked Washington for its continuous support.

**[On the face of it, the content of the latest arms sale does not look
particularly concerning to Beijing. The total size of the sale is much
less than the US\$1.4 billion approved last June]{.underline}**.

Unlike the sale in 2017 -- which included heavyweight torpedoes for
Taiwan's submarine force - the 2018 sale does not bring any new
capability for Taiwan. The whole package is reserved for the supply of
spare parts and logistics support for Taiwan's fighter fleet and other
planes, including F-16 Vipers and indigenously developed defence
fighters.

**[The sale is part of the Cooperative Logistics Supply Support
Arrangement deal.]{.underline}** The spare parts package may seem
underwhelming considering that **[this is a second arms sale to Taiwan
under]{.underline}** Donald **[Trump's administration]{.underline}**.
Taipei has been reportedly considering a letter of request for M1 Abrams
battle tanks or fifth-generation F-35B stealth jets, but no official
order has been placed yet.

However, **[the content of the sale is not the most crucial
aspect]{.underline}**, although its utility to Taiwan's air force cannot
be overstated. **[The fact that the sale is just about supply and
logistics suggest a change in attitude on the US side]{.underline}**.

First, **[the items were approved on a continuing basis]{.underline}**
and as needed and available. Second, the **[Trump]{.underline}**
administration **[has]{.underline}** not only **[moved]{.underline}**
from large bundles every few years to sales on an annual basis, but it
may also indicate a move **[away from bundling orders
altogether]{.underline}**.

**[In the past]{.underline}**, and especially during Barack Obama's two
terms, the US government came across as too accommodating in trying to
navigate relations with Taiwan in a way that would not upset Beijing,
and Chinese leaders seized on every opportunity to capitalise.

The result was that **[arms sales to Taiwan were bundled into large
packages and separated by long periods of no activity]{.underline}**,
though the ever-growing military capability of the PLA warranted a
response via robust arms sales, as presumed by the Taiwan Relations Act
of 1979. Something as routine as a supply of spare parts under the
logistics agreement became subject to political considerations. Now,
Washington may be returning to normal.

The arms sales notification was not the only good news for Taiwan.
Lockheed Martin announced that it had received an order for 18 Sniper
advanced targeting pods from Taiwan. Taiwanese pilots tested two sets of
the pods after their sale was announced in 2015, and the new order
indicates that the trials were satisfactory. Sniper targeting pods
increase Taiwan's capability to strike targets from greater distances
and in low visibility.

However, Beijing does not just have the US to worry about. Taiwanese
media reported on September 26 about two contracts with France on
training and upgrades to nearly 50 French-made Mirage 2000 high-altitude
fighter jets in Taiwan's air force inventory.

Moreover, Taiwan's defence ministry decided on a European design for
Taiwan's Indigenous Defence Submarine project. The media has speculated
that French shipbuilder Direction des Constructions Navales Services and
German Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft were among the contenders, and one
of them is likely to be the winner.

The French connection to Taiwan's defence modernisation is a timely
reminder that European defence industry companies are present and active
in Taiwan. With France and Germany leading European resistance against
adverse effects of the Belt and Road Initiative, and greater scrutiny
over Chinese investment in and acquisition of strategic industries,
Europe's arms suppliers may find the situation ripe for taking a greater
share in Taiwan's defence projects. Their governments may very well give
them the green light.

It is too early to say if the latest arms sale to Taiwan will deliver on
its promise of normalising the process of arms sales and (to the extent
possible) depoliticising decisions on arms sales by removing undue
deference to Beijing's perceptions.

America's Taiwan policy includes the peaceful resolution of the dispute
between Taipei and Beijing, one that will respect the will of Taiwanese
people. To this end, arms sales should be judged on their contribution
to Taiwan's defence posture and the gravity of the military threat
stemming from Beijing's actions and the PLA's capabilities.

**[What is clear is that the US is eager to reshape the whole process of
arms sales in a direction that would be beneficial for Taipei and
Washington]{.underline}**. Moreover, recent activity from European
suppliers might indicate a greater willingness to confront Beijing.

#### No Solvency -- China perceives salami tactics -- backlash to Taiwanese diplomacy proves

**Saunders** 200**5** -- Dr. Phillip C. Saunders is Director of the
Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs. He has been a
Distinguished Research Fellow at the Institute for National Strategic
Studies since January 2004. Dr. Saunders served as Director of Studies

Trends in China-Taiwan Relations: Implications for U.S. Taiwan Policy,"
*Asian Survey* Vol. 45 No. 6) bhb

**[The trend toward a separate Taiwan identity]{.underline}** poses a
difficult challenge for China because national identity cannot be easily
influenced by military or diplomatic means. If China wants to influence
how people in Taiwan think of themselves, it must find positive ways to
appeal to them. One possibility would be to emphasize a shared
ethno-cultural identity between people in China and Taiwan, while
acknowledging that people on Taiwan also have a Taiwan identity with
distinctive and different characteristics. China could promote positive
aspects of Chinese culture that appeal to people on Taiwan (and perhaps
even acknowledge its debt to the Republic of China for preserving
Chinese cultural artifacts that otherwise would have been destroyed in
the 1966--76 Cultural Revolution). Appeals to a shared Chinese
ethno-cultural identity might be attractive on Taiwan, because many
people think of themselves as having both Chinese and Taiwanese
identities. If China proves unable to influence conceptions of national
identity on Taiwan, then it is left with the less attractive (and much
more dangerous) option of trying to prevent Taiwan's government from
acting on a sense of separate identity to pursue formal independence.
This **[moves China's policy in the direction of threats and force
rather than persuasion]{.underline}**.

Taiwan's "Creeping Independence"

**[PRC officials and security analysts believe]{.underline}** that both
**[Lee]{.underline}** Teng-hui **[and Chen]{.underline}** Shui-bian have
**[used salami slicing tactics to move Taiwan toward independence. This
approach involves small movements toward a long-term objective without
ever taking an action large enough to justify a hostile response.
Actions]{.underline}** such as dismantling the Taiwan provincial
government and dissociating the government from formal commitments to
unification **[are regarded as steps in a process that might end
in]{.underline}** constitutional change and a **[formal declaration of
independence.]{.underline}** Chinese leaders and analysts believe Lee
Teng-hui consciously worked to loosen Taiwan's ties with China and
remove or weaken institutional structures and policies that symbolized
this linkage. This perception has been reinforced by Lee's subsequent
role in founding the Taiwan Solidarity Union (a pro-independence
political party) and his embrace of independence as a goal for Taiwan.
Lee's use of "vacation diplomacy" to travel to countries that did not
recognize Taiwan and efforts to increase Taiwan's international profile
are regarded as efforts to build international support for Taiwan
independence. **[This "zero-sum" perception]{.underline}** that any
international recognition of Taiwan is a step toward independence
**[makes PRC leaders determined to isolate Taiwan]{.underline}** in
every possible international forum.

bhb

Just as important as avoiding large arms packages is avoiding long
periods without any arms sales. A prolonged suspension of arms sales,
even one that begins for reasons other than assuaging China, will
gradually solidify into a precedent. **[Once a no-sales precedent is in
place, then even a small sale after ten years of none will become more
provocative than it would be today. China might seriously consider
accepting grave risks to uphold a new status quo of zero arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}**.

#### Arms sales produce insignificant job growth

student in political science at George Mason University's Schar School
of Policy and Government ("The False Promises of Trump's Arms Sales,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/false-promises-trumps-arms-sales)
bhb

Finally, **[Trump's claims about the economic benefits of arms sales
ring the hollowest]{.underline}** of all. For starters, not only won't
arms sales create a million new American jobs, but **[a great number of
the jobs created by arms sales will go to citizens of the purchasing
nations]{.underline}**. As the Security Assistance Monitor report notes,
the number of licenses granted to weapons manufacturers outside the
United States doubled from 2017 to 2018. As a result, **[more than
one-quarter of all U.S. arms "sales" last year were deals to permit the
manufacturing of U.S.-designed weapons under license]{.underline}** ---
that is, they created jobs in other nations instead of the United
States. The report also finds that the Trump administration has sharply
increased the number of deals in which foreign countries produce
U.S.-developed weaponry under coproduction agreements, further reducing
the number of U.S. jobs tied to arms sales.

Weakening the economic rationale even further is the fact that **[in
order to seal major deals, American defense contractors have to offer
massive discounts, or offsets, to the purchasing nations in the form of
coproduction arrangements or technology transfer]{.underline}**. In
2014, for example, these offsets equaled roughly one-third of the value
of total U.S. arms sales. **[These offsets]{.underline}** mean not only
that American arms sales are less profitable than they appear on paper,
but also that they **[lead to fewer jobs created in the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates than many, including the
president, would like to think. Trump's big Saudi arms deal, for
example, would likely lead to somewhere between 20,000 and 40,000 jobs,
or less than two-tenths of one percent of the American labor market.

The unpleasant truth is that the **[underwhelming economic benefits
cannot justify Washington's love of arms sales. Arms sales simply do not
benefit the U.S. economy]{.underline}** nearly as much as Trump likes to
claim. Meanwhile, a large percentage of American arms sales goes to
countries with horrible human rights records, to nations where arms are
at risk of finding their way into the wrong hands, and to nations
embroiled in dangerous and destabilizing conflicts. Given this, it is
long past time to rethink American arms sales policy.

## Japan Disad Answers

### 2AC -- Non-Unique

#### Trump threatening to leave defense security pack -- the threat and attitude of Trump has already destroyed US-Japan relations -- Japans already expanding military 

**Jacobs 6/24** (Jacobs, Jennifer. "Trump Muses Privately About Ending
Postwar Japan Defense Pact." Bloomberg.com, Bloomberg, 24 June 2019,
www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-25/trump-muses-privately-about-ending-postwar-japan-defense-pact.)

**[President Donald Trump has recently mused to confidants about
withdrawing from a longstanding defense treaty with
Japan,]{.underline}** **[according to three people familiar with the
matter, in his latest complaint about what he sees as unfair U.S.
security pacts.]{.underline}**

**[Trump regards the accord as too one-sided because it promises U.S.
aid if Japan is ever attacked, but doesn't oblige Japan's military to
come to America's defense]{.underline}**, the people said. **[The
treaty, signed more than 60 years ago, forms the foundation of the
alliance between the countries that emerged from World War
II.]{.underline}**

Even so, the president hasn't taken any steps toward pulling out of the
treaty, and administration officials said such a move is highly
unlikely. All of the people asked not to be identified discussing
Trump's private conversations. While Trump's repeated criticism of
security pacts around the world has alarmed allies from Seoul to Paris,
he hasn't moved to withdraw from such agreements the way he has with
trade deals.

**[Exiting the pact would jeopardize a postwar alliance that has helped
guarantee security in the Asia Pacific]{.underline}**, laying the
foundation for the region's economic rise. Under the terms of its
surrender in World War **[II, Japan agreed to a pacifist constitution in
which it renounced the right to wage war.]{.underline}**

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Tuesday in response
to a question about the Bloomberg News report that the security
framework was at the core of the country's alliance with the U.S. "There
is no talk at all of a review of the Japan-U.S. security alliance as has
been reported in the media," Suga said, echoing a statement by the
foreign ministry.

**[Scrapping the treaty would risk ceding security of the Western
Pacific to China and potentially spurring a fresh nuclear arms race, if
Japan decided it needed to protect itself from nuclear-armed
neighbors]{.underline}**. **[It would also call into question the U.S.'s
military commitments to Australia, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan
and a host of other allies around the world.]{.underline}**

Meeting With Abe

**[The president will make his second trip to Japan in a matter of weeks
on Wednesday when he travels for the Group of 20 summit in
Osaka]{.underline}**. He's expected to again meet with Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe, who enjoys as good a relationship with the
mercurial and unpredictable American president as any foreign leader.

**[Yet as with many U.S. allies, there are growing tensions between the
countries over Trump's attitude toward trade.]{.underline}** **[The
president has said he may enact tariffs on imports of foreign cars,
calling them a threat to national security]{.underline}** \-- an
allegation called preposterous by automakers and many U.S. lawmakers.

**[The question of whether an American president can withdraw from a
ratified treaty without congressional approval is
unsettled]{.underline}**. **[President George W. Bush withdrew from the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 without lawmakers'
consent.]{.underline}**

Trump regards Japan's repeated efforts to move a large U.S. military
base in Okinawa as a sort of land-grab, the people said, and has raised
the idea of seeking financial compensation for American forces to
relocate. **[Trump's focus on the U.S. defense pact with Japan may
foreshadow broader scrutiny of American treaty obligations across the
world, two people familiar with the matter said.]{.underline}**

The president has said in private conversations previously that he has
Japan's back and is aware of the U.S.'s obligations under the treaty.
But, as with his stance on other multilateral agreements, he wants the
relationship to be more reciprocal.

"The U.S.-Japan alliance has never been stronger," Trump told sailors
and Marines last month aboard the USS Wasp, an amphibious assault ship
at the naval base in Yokosuka, shared by the U.S. and Japan's
Self-Defense Forces. "This remarkable port is the only one in the world
where an American naval fleet and an allied naval fleet headquartered
side by side, a testament to the ironclad partnership between U.S. and
Japanese forces," he said.

At the same time, **[the president has long expressed skepticism of
arrangements such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
United Nations. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade
agreement and the Paris climate accord,]{.underline}** both agreed by
President Barack Obama, and has re-negotiated the North American Free
Trade Agreement.

The U.S. defense treaty with Japan was first signed in 1951 along with
the Treaty of San Francisco that officially ended World War II. The
defense pact, revised in 1960, grants the U.S. the right to base
military forces in Japan in exchange for the promise that America will
defend the island nation if it's ever attacked.

For decades after the war, Japan refrained from developing offensive
capabilities such as long-range bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear
weapons. But Abe, a relatively hawkish leader, believes his nation
should take a more robust role in its own defense. He pushed through a
controversial interpretation of the constitution to allow Japanese
forces to come to the aid of allies.

Japan is buying advanced F-35 fighter planes from the U.S. and will fly
some of them off warships effectively refashioned as aircraft carriers,
its first since the war. **[In May, the country's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party recommended the government eventually raise defense
spending to about 2% of gross domestic product, in line with NATO
recommendations for its members and a threshold Trump has said should be
a minimum for U.S. allies.]{.underline}**

'Cornerstone of Peace'

There are currently about 54,000 U.S. military personnel based in Japan,
a permanent troop presence that allows the U.S. to more easily project
force across the Pacific. U.S. Forces, Japan, calls the arrangement "the
cornerstone of peace and security in the Pacific" on its website.

It isn't clear how those forces would be affected if Trump withdrew from
the treaty. **[The president has frequently complained that U.S. allies
hosting American bases don't pay enough money for what he considers a
privilege]{.underline}**, and he could seek to negotiate a new or
revised treaty that entails more Japanese financial support for the U.S.
military presence.

While the president did not refer to the base by name in his recent
conversations, there has been a running dispute surrounding Marine Corps
Air Station Futenma on Okinawa. The American presence has been
controversial for more than two decades, since three servicemen raped a
12-year-old Okinawan girl in 1995. Local people still attribute the
presence of the base to higher rates of crime and accidents in the area,
according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

"There's nothing that says we have to abide by treaties for all
eternity," Carafano said. **["I just doubt we will revisit U.S. policy
on the U.S.-Japan strategic alliance," which he also referred to as the
"cornerstone" of U.S. foreign policy in Asia.]{.underline}**

Abe reached a deal in 2013 with Obama to move the base out of Okinawa as
early as 2022 if a replacement could be constructed. But Trump believes
the land underneath the base is valuable for development, and has told
confidants the real estate could be worth about \$10 billion, the people
said.

**[He considers the situation another example of a wealthy country
taking advantage of the U.S., the people said.]{.underline}**

#### Alliance deteriorating now - America first rhetoric, japan defense spending, and trade negotiations 

**Sracic 19** (Sracic, Paul. "Why Japan Is America\'s Most Important
Ally." CNN, Cable News Network, 26 Apr. 2019,
www.cnn.com/2019/04/25/opinions/sracic-trump-abe-japan-us-alliance/index.html.)

The failure of the Trump-Kim summit meeting in Hanoi in February means
the US needs to reevaluate its approach to North Korea. There are
reports that Trump has given a message to South Korean President Moon
Jae-in to be relayed to the North Korean leader. **[The contents of this
note will almost certainly be a topic of conversation between Trump and
Abe, and it is important that the two leaders emerge from their meetings
with a common understanding of how to approach North Korea. This is true
for several reasons.]{.underline}**

**[First, President Trump\'s \"America First\" rhetoric has caused
allies, including Japan, to question the reliability of the US as a
partner]{.underline}**. The administration, for its part, has explicitly
reaffirmed the US commitment to defend Japan.

**[Japan has responded by planning increased defense spending and
interpreting its constitution to allow its military to come to the aid
of the US.]{.underline}** **[Therefore, unlike America\'s relationship
with some of its other allies, the US and Japan seem to be on the same
page when it comes to alliance responsibilities]{.underline}**.
Reassuring Japan that its interests are being considered, vis-a-vis
North Korea, will not only help the US-Japan relationship, but might
also serve as a positive lesson for other allies.

Of course, this lesson is not limited to friends of the US. A united
US-Japan approach to North Korea will also place more pressure on Kim
Jong Un and his main benefactor, China. At the same time, it is
important to ensure that engagement with the North Korea does not emerge
as a wedge issue between Japan and South Korea.

**[Relations between these two crucial US allies have been deteriorating
in recent months]{.underline}**, **[and although there is not much that
President Trump can do to heal their disputes over history, the US needs
to be careful not to worsen the situation.]{.underline}**

**[A less serious but perhaps more immediate issue to be discussed on
Friday involves the US-Japan economic relationship]{.underline}**.
**[Last fall, the US and Japan agreed to begin negotiating a bilateral
free-trade agreement.]{.underline}** **[The two nations\' economies are
closely linked]{.underline}**. The US is the second-most popular
destination for Japanese exports, while Japan provides a major market
for US exports, including agricultural products.

**[Still, the US runs a persistent trade deficit with
Japan]{.underline}**. Although Japan trails only the UK in the amount of
money it invests in the US (and much of that is used to create
manufacturing jobs), **[the trade deficit has provoked Trump to take a
hard line with Japan on trade; it likely played a role Trump\'s decision
to withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.]{.underline}**

**[This withdrawal, however, alongside Japan\'s decision to move forward
with remaining TPP countries to form the Comprehensive and Progressive
Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, while also signing a major
trade agreement with the EU, threatens US agricultural
exports.]{.underline}**

#### Japan no longer believes in US security -- Trump views them as freeriders and Japanese no longer believes in the resolve of US 

**Miura 19** (Miura, Lully. Lully Miura is a lecturer at the Policy
Alternatives Research Institute of the University of Tokyo. "In the Time
of Trump, Japan Is Looking to Defend Itself." South China Morning Post,

www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2181764/how-trump-forced-japan-take-security-its-own-hands.)

**[A decade or so from now, people may look back on 2019 as a turning
point for Japan -- the moment it finally came to terms with its own
security in the 21st century.]{.underline}**

**[Two years of the Donald Trump administration in the United States
have shaken the Japanese public, but after a bit of shock, they have
accepted a new reality]{.underline}**. This is a post-Iraq-war world and
Japan, **[for the first time since the end of the second world war, is
facing the challenge of providing for its own security.]{.underline}**

**[Spurned in midterms, Trump turns sights on Japanese car
firms]{.underline}**

In the quarter century since the end of the cold war, which did not
conclude with a "peace dividend" for East Asia, Japan has had to cope
with the changing times. Throughout the 1990s, its alliance with the US
was redefined, and Tokyo has had to confirm that such an alliance is
still relevant. It has also sought to normalise its security policy
while continuing its pacifist tradition. The ability to send its Self
Defence Forces to peace missions overseas, and exercise collective
self-defence with the US, were important steps during this period.

**[But Japan is now facing the sobering reality that its security
environment has changed, more so than the incremental steps it has so
far taken towards bolstering its defences would suggest.]{.underline}**

**[Asia has faced its fair share of security challenges in the
past]{.underline}** -- from the Soviet military build-up of the 1950s
and 1960s, to China becoming a nuclear power in 1964 and the North
Korean nuclear crisis that still rumbles on to this day -- **[but none
of these crises changed the fundamentals of East Asian security, since
the US' relative military superiority and resolve were never in
question.]{.underline}**

**[So long as the region could count on US commitment, other factors
were of secondary concern.]{.underline}**

**[What has changed in the Trump era is American resolve.]{.underline}**
**[His emergence within the Republican Party, mirrored on the left by a
renewed enthusiasm for disengagement within the Democratic Party, is a
clear sign of shifting priorities in the US over whether to maintain its
informal "empire" overseas.]{.underline}**

What Japan can teach China about the American art of (trade) war

**[Of course, America will not simply turn over its worldwide dominance
to China]{.underline}**. Its recent focus on pressuring China
economically, and rebuilding its technological pre-eminence, are clear
signs that it doesn't intend to do so. From a **[security perspective,
the US' modernisation of its nuclear arsenal, investments in artificial
intelligence and cybersecurity, and honing in on space warfare are all
signs of its imperial resolve.]{.underline}** **[But that doesn't
necessarily translate into regional hegemony in East
Asia.]{.underline}**

**[Talks between the US and North Korea have also signalled a symbolic
change to US foreign policy in the region.]{.underline}**

**[US appeasement towards Pyongyang has been met by feelings of
disappointment and helplessness in the Japanese media,]{.underline}**
especially when Trump mentioned Japan as one of the main cost bearers of
denuclearisation, despite no concrete agreement having been made.
**[Once again, Japan would be paying for something it has little
influence over.]{.underline}**

**[The country finds itself in an awkward position, as it has no
offensive capabilities to draw concessions out of North Korea, yet the
US does not share its fear of Pyongyang]{.underline}**. Tokyo can only
attempt to influence the situation by influencing the US.

Japan bids farewell to emperor with a common touch as divisions over
monarchy deepen

**[The talks have also exposed a more fundamental issue: the gap in
perceptions between Tokyo and Washington regarding their alliance. The
Trump administration embodies a distrust of Japan as a "free-rider" that
does not contribute enough towards its own defence.]{.underline}** This
is not a view widely shared in Japan at all. **[The Japanese public is
more afraid of "entrapment" by the US and becoming tangled up in its
wars.]{.underline}** **[This perception gap exists because the Japanese
public have largely been shielded from the realities of the alliance by
a government that has feared being abandoned by the US]{.underline}**,
but did not want to broadcast its hospitality towards the superpower for
fear of a pacifist backlash.

**[In the two years since Trump came to power, the Japanese public have
become increasingly sceptical of US support in the case of a limited
crisis]{.underline}**, **[such as one involving the disputed Diaoyu
Islands, which Japan calls the Senkaku Islands]{.underline}**. Japanese
progressives -- both in opposition and in the media -- have become more
isolationist. **[They are keen to weaken the allianc]{.underline}**e,
but not necessarily build up independent military capabilities. Neither
do recent progressives see China favourably, compared with the cold war
period.

**[In the same way Japan is wary of the US, it is also wary of South
Korea given their historical issues]{.underline}**, with ties fraying
again now because of a disagreement over wartime labour compensation.

**[its military relationships with others]{.underline}**, such as the
members of the Quad, **[and plans to boost defence spending over the
next five years with advanced military equipment from the
US.]{.underline}**

Yet these guidelines, while championing resilience and
self-sustainability, also continue with the basic philosophy of
pacifism. **[The remaining years of the Trump era are likely to see
Japanese society further torn between isolationism and
realism]{.underline}**

### 2AC -- No Internal Link -- No Abandonment

#### No internal link -- fear of abandonment doesn't motivate Japan's decisions 

**Dr. Nagy,** 20**17**

(Stephen R., Senior Associate Professor in the Department of Politics
and International Studies at the International Christian University,
"Japan's Proactive Pacifism: Investing in Multilateralization and
Omnidirectional Hedging", Strategic Analysis, Vol. 41, Iss. 3, pp.
223-235, ZW)

But **[just the fear of abandonment cannot]{.underline}** fully
**[explain Japan's security shift under]{.underline}** PM
**[Abe]{.underline}** since 2012. Firstly, **[prior]{.underline}** **[to
his return]{.underline}** to power in December 2012 **[the US and Japan
had been strengthening their commitment]{.underline}** to each other, in
terms of practice, policy and vision.

In terms of practice, 3/11 (the March 11, 2011 earthquake/tsunami and
**[Fukushima]{.underline}** Daiichi nuclear power plant disaster)
**[provided Japan with ample proof of US commit- ment to
Japan]{.underline}**, **[by way of Operation Tomodachi]{.underline}**.32
**[Direct and indirect assistance from the US]{.underline}** to Japan
following the tsunami and the Fukushima Daiichi incident **[in the form
of logistics, transport, supplies and expertise demonstrated not only
the US' capacity to help but also the deep inter-operability of the
Japanese Self Defence Force]{.underline}** (JSDF) **[and the American
military forces stationed in Japan]{.underline}**.33

**[Other examples]{.underline}** of the deepening US commitment to Japan
**[include the strength- ening of the Japan--US Defence
Guidelines]{.underline}**34 **[and the support for easing restrictions
on the JSDF that would facilitate a more functional security partnership
in multi- lateral frameworks]{.underline}**, such as the Quadrilateral
Security Dialogue (QUAD), and at the bilateral level with countries such
as Australia and India.35,36 These examples are contemporary
illustrations of the pre-existing track record of the strong security
commitment of the US to Japan, as evidenced by the 'Joint Statement of
the Security Consultative Committee' of April 27, 2012 (prior to Abe's
second stint as PM) which was promulgated during the Noda
administration.37

Scholars such as Satake point out that new guidelines for Japan--US
security cooperation and the US' interest in promoting greater
cooperation with Japan are contributing to East Asia's security
architecture. He stresses expanded bilateral cooperation not only in the
South China Sea (SCS), in terms of surveillance, but also in capacity
building with like-minded states in the region, such as Vietnam and the
Philippines, to meet regional and global security challenges.38

**[As regards]{.underline}** the fear of **[entrapment]{.underline}**,
the US' desire and encouragement to include Japan in surveillance and
other security operations in the SCS, and beyond, could be interpreted
as a slippery slope that could draw Japan into a US-related conflict.
Notwithstanding this possibility, **[Japan]{.underline}** has
**[minimized]{.underline}** this **[risk at the legal level by imposing
rigorous limitations, as to when and how Japan can cooperate with the US
for collective security]{.underline}**.39 At a normative level, Japan
has partially inoculated itself against a reactionary military
involvement by means of public opinion that is widely sceptical of
security cooperation.40

At the same time, successive politicians, including Noda (Democratic
Party of Japan \[DPJ\]) and Abe (Liberal Democratic Party \[LDP\]), have
proactively sought to strengthen and expand security cooperation with
the US as mainstream political parties and members of Japan's political
centre recognize the need for a reconfigur- ing and normalization of
Japan's security architecture.41 In short, Japan has worked proactively
under several administrations and political ideologies to expand the
activities of its JSDF while at the same time limiting the scope of
their involvement. This delicate balance is partly driven by the fear of
entrapment, but Japanese security concerns in the region also require a
realistic calculation of how to enhance Japanese security, while
remaining true to its post-World War II pacifist tradition.

In terms of policy, **[Japan and the US have grounded their security
policy in bilateral and multilateral economic
arrangements]{.underline}**, as **[illustrated by]{.underline}** the now
invalid but salvageable TPP, **[the]{.underline}** Theatre Missile
Defence (**[TMD]{.underline}**) **[and]{.underline}** a commitment to
the multilateralization of maritime security through the Rim of the
Pacific Exercises (**[RIMPAC]{.underline}**). Bilateral support for the
installation of the Terminal High Altitude Air Defence
(**[THAAD]{.underline}**) counter-missile systems **[in South Korea to
counter North Korea\`s growing capabilities further demonstrates
that]{.underline}**, rather than abandonment or being entrapped by each
other's security issues, **[both countries are proactively working
together to mitigate security threats in the region.]{.underline}**42

### 2AC -- No Impact -- Alliance Inevitable

#### Japanese alliance is inevitable -- existing security guarantees outweigh Taiwan

**[Although a decision by the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to end its commitment to Taiwan
would]{.underline}** certainly **[send]{.underline}** political shock
**[waves]{.underline}** across the region, these **[concerns are
overstated. There are similarities between]{.underline}** the U.S.
commitments to **[Taiwan and Japan, but]{.underline}** also **[clear
differences. U.S. security interests in Japan are much greater; as a
result, the alliance involves much stronger political commitments and
the deep integration of U.S. and Japanese military
capabilities]{.underline}**. In addition, **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[has a clear rationale for ending its
commitment to Taiwan that does not apply to Japan: the U.S. commitment
to Taiwan strains the U.S.-China relationship and increases the
probability of war in ways that the U.S. commitment to Japan does
not.]{.underline}** Japan should appreciate these differences and
therefore recognize that the ending of the U.S. commitment to Taiwan
would not indicate a coming diminution of the U.S. commitment to Japan.
**[U.S. leaders could work to make sure that their Japanese counterparts
fully appreciate these differences]{.underline}**.

In addition, the United States could take other actions that would
starkly distinguish its policies toward Japan from its policies toward
Taiwan, which should help to offset doubts that accommodation on Taiwan
might create. Most obviously, the United States could increase the size
and improve the quality of the forces it commits to Japan's protection.
Other policies could include further deepening U.S.-Japan joint military
planning and continuing high-level discussions of the requirements for
extending deterrence to Japan. Growth in Chinese conventional and
nuclear forces has increased the importance of these interactions;
ending the U.S. commitment to Taiwan would make them still more
valuable.98

Finally, **[as China's power continues to grow, Japan's need for U.S.
security guarantees will also grow. Doubts about U.S. reliability are
therefore likely to convince Japan to work harder to strengthen the
U.S.-Japan alliance, not to abandon it or to bandwagon with
China.]{.underline}**99

#### Japan won't proliferate -- the public is overwhelmingly against becoming a nuclear state

**[The Three Non-Nuclear Principles are a clear part of Japan's national
identity, not simply a policy preference]{.underline}**. **[Repeated
polls indicate overwhelming popular support for the three
principles]{.underline}** in Japan. A **[2014]{.underline}** Asahi
newspaper **[poll revealed]{.underline}** that **[support]{.underline}**
for the principles **[had risen to 82 percent]{.underline}**,
**[compared with 78 percent]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** a
**[1988]{.underline}** poll. **[Despite]{.underline}** **[growing
concerns about North Korea]{.underline}**'s nuclear program and China's
military power **[during this period, Japanese support for remaining
non-nuclear actually increased.]{.underline}**

Even **[after]{.underline}** the provocative **[North Korean missile
launches over Japan in August and September]{.underline}**, a Fuji News
Network poll showed that **[nearly 80 percent of the Japanese population
remained opposed to Japan becoming a nuclear weapons
state.]{.underline}** And **[nearly 69 percent opposed having the United
States bring nuclear weapons into Japan.]{.underline}**

**[The legacy]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** the **[Hiroshima and
Nagasaki]{.underline}** atomic bombings **[leave many]{.underline}**
Japanese **[convinced that their]{.underline}**
**[country]{.underline}** **[has]{.underline}** **[a moral
responsibility to promote]{.underline}** global nuclear
**[disarmament]{.underline}** --- as well as to forgo nuclear weapons of
its own. The 2011 **[Fukushima]{.underline}** nuclear plant disaster has
**[reinforced this view]{.underline}**.

In fact, **[increasing numbers of Japanese believe that the U.S.
"nuclear umbrella" is unnecessary for Japanese security]{.underline}**.
A June 2010 NHK survey revealed that 20.8 percent felt that U.S. nuclear
deterrence is necessary for Japan's security in both the present and
future, while 34.8 percent believed it unnecessary. The June
**[2015]{.underline}** NHK **[poll showed that only 10.3 percent thought
the U.S. nuclear umbrella is necessary for both the present and the
future --- 48.9 percent responded that it is unnecessary now and
later.]{.underline}**

#### Veto players ensure Japan doesn't develop nuclear weapons

**Mochizuki, 2017**

(Mike, Japan-US Relations Chair in Memory of Gaston Sigur at the Elliott
School of International Affairs at George Washington University, "Three
reasons why Japan will likely continue to reject nuclear weapons", The
Washington Post, November 6,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/06/japan-is-likely-to-retain-its-non-nuclear-principles-heres-why/?utm_term=.6d70be40ca7a,
accessed 6/24/29, ZW)

In addition to public opposition to nuclear weapons, **[Japan has
significant "veto players"]{.underline}** --- crucial political or
economic actors that are **[likely to block efforts to develop nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}**

Japan has a robust nuclear energy industry. But **[public acceptance of
nuclear energy]{.underline}** in the 1950s **[resulted from a
fundamental]{.underline}** political **[bargain: nuclear energy, but no
nuclear weapons.]{.underline}**

As security scholar Jacques Hymans argues, **[the development of nuclear
energy]{.underline}** in Japan **[boosted the number of Japanese
government agencies and private-sector actors]{.underline}** that are
**[committed to the peaceful use of nuclear power --- and can serve as a
formidable opposition to any political move toward acquiring nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. These **[veto players include powerful economic
ministries, regulatory commissions, industrial groups and prefectural
governments.]{.underline}**

**[The international nonproliferation regime and public opposition to
nuclear weapons give these veto players leverage in Japan's policy
process.]{.underline}** The International Atomic Energy Agency has
closely monitored Japan's reprocessing programs, for instance. Japan's
nuclear energy program is also tied to bilateral agreements and
multilateral bodies such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group that embody
nonproliferation principles.

#### Japan's security calculations make nuclearization unlikely -- political costs vastly outweigh marginal strategic benefits

**Mochizuki, 2017**

(Mike, Japan-US Relations Chair in Memory of Gaston Sigur at the Elliott
School of International Affairs at George Washington University, "Three
reasons why Japan will likely continue to reject nuclear weapons", The
Washington Post, November 6,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/06/japan-is-likely-to-retain-its-non-nuclear-principles-heres-why/?utm_term=.6d70be40ca7a,
accessed 6/24/29, ZW)

There's also a realist security calculation to consider. **[North Korean
nuclearization]{.underline}** is alarming, but it **[does not pose such
an acute danger that Japanese leaders will be motivated to pay the high
political costs necessary to weaken, much less revoke, the Three
Non-Nuclear Principles.]{.underline}**

North Korea acquiring the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon against
the United States may weaken the protective U.S. nuclear umbrella
somewhat, but **[U.S. nuclear and conventional military capabilities
should be adequate to deter a North Korean nuclear attack on
Japan.]{.underline}**

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump criticized several
U.S. alliances and mused that it might be desirable for Japan to develop
nuclear weapons. But **[after assuming office]{.underline}**, President
**[Trump]{.underline}** and his foreign policy team have **[repeatedly
confirmed the U.S. defense commitment to Japan.]{.underline}** **[The
continuing presence of U.S. military forces in Japan, South Korea and
the Western Pacific makes this commitment credible to deter potential
aggressors and to reassure Japan.]{.underline}**

Given the powerful U.S. nuclear arsenal, including ballistic missiles
deployed on nuclear submarines, **[any U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in
Japan itself would constitute a marginal increase in deterrence. But the
political cost of rescinding the third non-nuclear principle would be
high.]{.underline}**

Japanese defense policymakers are more likely to focus on other ways to
respond to the North Korea threat, such as acquiring the Aegis Ashore
missile defense system and perhaps a conventional strike capability.

**[A realistic review of Japanese security requirements is likely to
conclude that the best way to counter the North Korea threat is to
promote defense cooperation with the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, **[invest in conventional defense capabilities
and increase pressure on North Korea]{.underline}** --- while looking
for an opportunity for constructive negotiations with Pyongyang.

And there's **[a final consideration: A Japanese bomb would probably
destabilize the country's relations with China and South
Korea.]{.underline}** At a time **[when North Korea is making the
international politics of the region complicated, Japan is likely to
stay its non-nuclear course rather than make a disruptive nuclear move
of its own.]{.underline}**

### 2AC -- No Prolif -- General

#### No rapid proliferation -- lack of interest or capabilities -- specifically fissile material

**Keck, 2013**

(Zachary, staff writer for The Diplomat, "Why Nuclear Weapons Don\'t
Spread (Quickly)", The Diplomat, December 4,
https://thediplomat.com/2013/12/why-nuclear-weapons-dont-spread-quickly/,
accessed on 6/25/19, ZW)

At the same time, when one examines the properties of nuclear weapons
more closely, **[the lack of interest is easier to
understand]{.underline}**. **[Nuclear weapons]{.underline}** have
basically served one purpose for states possessing them; namely, they
have **[deterred others from challenging that state's survival and other
fundamental interests.]{.underline}** But **[the nuclear era has also
been characterized by a sharp decline in warfare and]{.underline}**
today **[fewer states face fundamental external threats to their
existence.]{.underline}** Given the high costs of building and
maintaining a nuclear arsenal, it makes little sense to acquire nuclear
weapons without such an existential threat.

While lack of interest explains why some states have renounced nuclear
weapons despite possessing the capability to build them, **[the
difficulty in building them has prevented others states that seek
nuclear weapons from acquiring them.]{.underline}** Despite the view
that "where there is a will there's a way," and a strong sense that
globalization has exacerbated this, the historical record tells a very
different story.

As Jacques Hymans has pointed out, before 1970 seven countries launched
dedicated nuclear weapon programs and all seven succeeded in an average
of seven years. Since 1970, ten states have launched dedicated nuclear
weapons programs and only three have succeeded (the jury's still out on
Iran). These three have taken an average of 17 years to succeed and Iran
under the Islamic Republic has been working towards a nuclear weapon
capability for some three decades.

Just as **[pundits]{.underline}** have **[routinely underestimated the
difficulty of building nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, so too do **[they
grossly overstate the number of states who are technically capable of
building them.]{.underline}** Both **[journalists and scholars regularly
cite 40]{.underline}** as the number of non-nuclear weapon states who
are technically capable of building them. **[This figure is often
attributed to]{.underline}** the former head of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohamed **[ElBaradei]{.underline}**, who said in
2004:

"Some estimates indicate that 40 countries or more now have the know-how
to produce nuclear weapons, which means if they have the required
fissile material --- high enriched uranium or plutonium --- we are
relying primarily on the continued good intentions of these countries."

As Scott Sagan has pointed out, **[most of those citing ElBaradei omit
the latter part of his statement about having the required fissile
material. But this statement is crucial as only a handful of NNWS are
capable of producing or otherwise procuring fissile material, which is
necessary for a nuclear bomb.]{.underline}**

Moreover, thanks in no small part to President Obama's focus on nuclear
security, **[the global availability of fissile material has been
declining as the U.S. and its allies help remove fissile material from
some states while downsizing the stockpiles in many
others.]{.underline}** Furthermore, compared with the Cold War era and
even the 1990s, nuclear weapon holding and nuclear capable states are
much less willing to sell NNWS crucial dual use technology that can be
used to indigenously produce fissile material.

**[Thus, contrary to common perception, there is no impeding nuclear
domino about to fall.]{.underline}**

### 2AC -- Impact Turn -- Prolif Good -- Solves Overstretch

#### Impact Turn -- allowing "friendly" prolif reduces the risk of deadly conflict and the benefits outweigh the risks -- prefer comparative evidence

**Bandow, 2016**

(Doug, Senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former Special Assistant
to President Ronald Reagan, "Let Them Make Nukes: The Case for
\"Friendly\" Proliferation", Foreign Policy, July 26,

But the biggest cost is the human one, since **[maintaining the nuclear
umbrella increases the risk of conflict.]{.underline}** Hypothetically,
**[if Washington were to aid any of these states in the face of a
nuclear attack, it would expose itself to a retaliatory
attack]{.underline}** on U.S. soil, **[which would put the lives of
thousands if not millions]{.underline}** of its own citizens **[in
jeopardy for modest or even minimal gains]{.underline}**. Without a Cold
War, **[the R]{.underline}**epublic **[o]{.underline}**f
**[K]{.underline}**orea **[is not particularly important to U.S.
security]{.underline}**; moreover, **[Seoul]{.underline}**, which is the
world's 13th largest economy, **[is capable of defending
itself.]{.underline}** It could also field a much larger conventional
force and South Korean experts have boasted that the country has the
capability to produce a nuclear weapon in less than two years.

Moreover, **[many]{.underline}** of the **[risks]{.underline}** that
**[Washington's help is meant to fend off are fanciful]{.underline}**.
No one could really imagine a Chinese armada sailing into Tokyo Bay. And
**[even if war did arise between Japan and China]{.underline}** over the
Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, **[it is unlikely that Washington would actually
use nukes against China]{.underline}** for such low stakes. The question
of whether nuclear defense alliances are necessary begs another: Do they
even work? Historically, deterrence often fails. Both World Wars
featured defensive alliances that failed to prevent conflict. Instead,
the military pacts expanded the conflicts.

**[One possible solution is to replace the nuclear umbrella with
"friendly" proliferation]{.underline}**. The United States could allow
its Asian allies---Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan---to develop their own
deterrence against China and North Korea. **[If conflict emerged, the
United States would not automatically be dragged into
war]{.underline}**. Washington could reconfigure its military for its
own defense, rather than overstretch itself by providing offense for
every one of its allies across the globe.

To be sure, even friendly proliferation would have **[negative
consequences]{.underline}**. But they **[are not as alarming as commonly
thought]{.underline}**. Permitting **[South Korea and
Japan]{.underline}** to build **[nuclear weapons would undermine
the]{.underline}** Nuclear
**[N]{.underline}**on**[p]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty, **[but]{.underline}** in reality, **[so has
Israel's possession of nuclear weapons, Washington's acceptance of India
as a nuclear power, and allied negotiation with Iran to forestall its
development of nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. Nonproliferation policy
always has been tempered by changing circumstances. Washington should
allow the same in northeast Asia.

**[Proliferation could also accelerate the regional arms
race]{.underline}**, particularly given that there is currently no known
limit to North Korea's nuclear ambitions. **[China might]{.underline}**
also **[speed up improvements]{.underline}** to its nuclear program
**[in response, but it would be difficult, if not impossible, for such
efforts to overcome the capabilities of U.S. allies. Missiles from just
one Japanese submarine could take out China's most important
cities]{.underline}**, irrespective of Beijing's retaliatory capacity.

Another downside to proliferation is that the greater the number of
nations with nukes, the higher **[the risk of accidents, mistakes,
leakages, misuse, and more]{.underline}**. But these risks **[are fairly
low compared to aggressive behavior that the nuclear umbrella
encourages]{.underline}**---essentially, **[it rewards U.S. allies into
being more aggressive risk-takers.]{.underline}** **[In the
2000s]{.underline}**, the emboldened Taiwanese President **[Chen
Shui-bian routinely challenged Beijing. Georgia started the 2008 war
against Russia with the apparent assumption that Washington would
come]{.underline}** to Tbilisi's aid, **[if needed.]{.underline}**

**[Friendly proliferation could also increase nuclear tensions and
instability]{.underline}**, **[especially during the transition phase
when countries are in the process of increasing their
stockpiles.]{.underline}** Other powers might be tempted to thwart their
attempts at building nuclear weapons by launching an attack. **[But
countries]{.underline}** secure in their deterrent capabilities, **[such
as China, are less likely to see a fledgling nuclear power as a
threat]{.underline}**. For example, a half century ago, the United
States and the Soviet Union, comfortable with their own capabilities,
decided not to stymie China's nascent nuclear weapons program. **[If
North Korea feels threatened by nuclear programs in South Korea and
Japan, Washington could maintain its security guarantee until its allies
develop their retaliatory capabilities in full.]{.underline}** That
should be enough to keep Pyongyang in check.

### 1AR -- Impact Turn -- Prolif Good -- Deters North Korea

#### Japanese possession of nuclear weapons would be the signal necessary to get China to rein in North Korea

**Kelly and Kubo, 2017**

(Tim and Nobuhiro, staff writers for Reuters, "Allowing nuclear weapons
in Japan could defuse North Korean threat, say some policy makers",
Reuters, September 6,
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-japan/allowing-nuclear-weapons-in-japan-could-defuse-north-korean-threat-say-some-policy-makers-idUSKCN1BH1FO>,

**[North Korea]{.underline}**, pursuing its weapons programs in defiance
of international condemnation, **[fired an]{.underline}** intermediate
**[ballistic missile over Japan]{.underline}** last week, prompting
authorities to sound sirens and advise residents to take cover.

On Sunday, **[North Korea tested a nuclear device that had a
yield]{.underline}** estimated at **[ten times that of
the]{.underline}** atom **[bomb dropped]{.underline}** by the United
States **[on Hiroshima]{.underline}** in 1945.

Inviting U.S. **[nuclear weapons would be an attempt by Japan jolt
China]{.underline}**, North Korea's sole major ally,
**[to]{.underline}** do more to **[rein in its neighbor by showing there
are consequences to North Korean provocations]{.underline}** that
threaten its neighbors and destabilize the region, the policy maker
said.

A simple way to do this could be for a nuclear-armed U.S. submarine to
operate from one of the U.S. Navy bases in Japan, he said, a move bound
to infuriate China.

Former Japanese defense minister **[Shigeru Ishiba]{.underline}**
**[stoked controversy]{.underline}** on Wednesday **[by questioning
whether Japan can expect protection under the U.S. nuclear umbrella
while maintaining its non-nuclear principles.]{.underline}**

"Is it right that we don't discuss this?" Ishiba asked in a television
interview.

In his election campaign last year, Donald Trump chided Japan and South
Korea for not contributing enough to their defenses. On Tuesday, the
president said he was ready to sell Seoul billions of dollars in weapons
and scrap a limit on the size of warheads the Washington would supply.

"We don't have any plan to begin discussing the three non-nuclear
principles," Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters
when asked to respond to Ishiba's comment.

Yet, the growing North Korean threat could stifle some of the
opposition, experts say.

"Just by **[raising this issue of nuclear principles]{.underline}**,
Japan **[will push the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[and China to act]{.underline}**, and it is **[something that Beijing
is not going to like]{.underline}**," said Takashi Kawakami, a security
expert at Japan's Takushoku University.

**["It's the medicine that China needs to make it act against North
Korea."]{.underline}**

### Arms Race =/= War

#### Arms race doesn't lead to conflict -- most countries lack key capability elements, maintain defensive capability

**Huxley, 2018**

(Tim, Executive director at the International Institute for Strategic
Studies (Asia), "Why Asia\'s \'arms race\' is not quite what it seems",
World Economic Forum, September 12,
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/09/asias-arms-race-and-why-it-doesnt-matter/,
accessed 6/25/19, ZW)

Media reports often highlight expensive arms purchases by Asian
governments. But military capability is complex, and **[buying new 'kit'
does not provide countries with instant capabilities]{.underline}**, as
is often inferred. **[Other]{.underline}** important
**[elements]{.underline}** **[of capability include appropriate
doctrine,]{.underline}** suitable **[training]{.underline}**, inspiring
**[leadership]{.underline}**, high **[morale]{.underline}**, vital
**[logistic support]{.underline}** (including defence-industrial
capacity), relevant **[combat experience and]{.underline}** a high level
of **[operational integration between military branches and
services]{.underline}**. Besides, mastery of the cyber domain may be
emerging as the sine qua non of military capability, potentially
providing the capacity to take down an opponent's ability and will to
fight even before a shot is fired.

**[Only a minority of Asian armed forces possess all these key
capability elements]{.underline}**. In many cases, **[while they
might]{.underline}** be able to hold **[domestic insurgents or other
forms of unrest at bay]{.underline}**, or engage in border skirmishes,
**[their forces would be unable to mount sustained operations against
those of other countries.]{.underline}** Moreover, **[most of the
military capabilities under development in the region remain essentially
defensive.]{.underline}**

This applies not least to China's People's Liberation Army (PLA).
China's major, sustained, long-term defence effort is certainly
enhancing the capabilities of the PLA, which would in any conflict now
be able to complicate US operational planning and activities severely.
But China's long-range offensive capabilities -- its nuclear deterrent
aside - remain limited. The PLA is still a long way from matching
American capabilities, and it would have little hope of winning any
conflict with the US, whose military presence and commitments continue
to ensure the security of the whole region.

**[More lavish military spending and arms acquisition by Asian
governments]{.underline}** mean that they would be able to inflict
greater damage on adversaries in the event of conflict. But these
military efforts -- **[with the]{.underline}** unique **[exception of
North Korea's nuclear and missile]{.underline}** development
**[programmes]{.underline}** -- **[are]{.underline}** **[themselves not
the most likely causes of conflict in the region.]{.underline}**
Political differences between states deriving from geopolitical
ambition, and potential miscalculation, are far more dangerous and
likely causes of war.

### No War -- Japan-China ties good

#### Sino-Japanese relations are good -- economic ties, navigating Trump, and conflict avoidance -- G-20, AIIB, and Senkakus prove

**Olsen, 6/24/19**

(Kelly, Hong Kong Correspondent for CNBC, "Japan and China look to
strengthen ties at G-20 summit, even as Trump looms large", CNBC,

accessed 6/25/19, ZW)

Analysts say **[reasons for the rapprochement include economic
interdependence, a need to focus on the future and]{.underline}** the
emergence of an unforeseen wild card: **[the]{.underline}** 2016
**[election]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** U.S. President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}**, whose presence in Osaka looms large for both
men.

"**[The greatest impetus for warming Sino-Japanese relations is their
realization that China and Japan need to cooperate]{.underline}** with
each other more closely **[in the face of their]{.underline}** changing
**[relations with the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, "
Victor Teo, an assistant professor in the Department of Japanese Studies
at the University of Hong Kong, told CNBC in an email.

Japan is a loyal U.S. ally and the countries are tightly bound
economically. But **[Abe is wary of Trump's]{.underline}** protectionist
"**[America First" tendencies]{.underline}** and has --- so far, at
least --- deftly avoided becoming a major tariff target.

Not so **[Xi]{.underline}**, who **[has been forced to
fight]{.underline}** back **[in a damaging trade war]{.underline}**
launched by the Trump administration.

Almost smiling

While Trump has provided Abe and Xi with reasons to move closer, the
effort long predates his arrival.

Already high bilateral tensions between China and Japan were spiraling
higher just before the two Asian leaders took power, around the same
time more than six years ago.

The **[escalation was due in part to a]{.underline}** simmering
**[dispute over control of]{.underline}** uninhabited **[islands in the
E]{.underline}**ast **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea, which
spilled into anti-Japanese protests in Chinese cities.

Ties remained rocky and were further inflamed in late 2013 when Abe, a
staunch nationalist, visited a Tokyo shrine honoring Japan's war dead,
including from World War II, which infuriated Beijing.

China and Japan are major trade and investment partners. While they are
also rivals for political and economic influence in the Asia-Pacific
region and beyond, they have come to realize the need to work together,
analysts say.

A major step in the cooling off process was a wording compromise on the
dispute over the small islands that both claim, but which are
effectively controlled by Japan. That was immediately followed by the
grim-looking leaders clasping hands in Beijing in November 2014 just
ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum summit hosted by
Xi.

**[While neither side has given up its claims to those
islands]{.underline}** --- and their ships and planes continue to play
cat-and-mouse in the area --- **[they have successfully lowered the
temperature and avoided escalation.]{.underline}** Japan's
**[Abe]{.underline}** too has **[refrained from further shrine
visits.]{.underline}**

By the time Abe and Xi met in Vietnam in 2017, they were almost smiling,
underscoring their steadily improving ties.

"Our **[relations are back on a normal track]{.underline}**," Chen
Deming, a former Chinese commerce minister, declared in a speech in
Tokyo last month, in wording that was similar to that used by Abe in
January.

Japan politics expert Brad Glosserman pointed out that there was **[a
significant shift]{.underline}** last year which
**[highlighted]{.underline}** their **[thawing ties: An agreement to
cooperate in]{.underline}** so-called **[third countries]{.underline}**,
**[such as those involved with]{.underline}** **[China's]{.underline}**
massive **[Belt and Road]{.underline}** infrastructure project **[and
the]{.underline}** Beijing-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
(**[AIIB]{.underline}**).

"That's a really important development in so far as it changes thinking
about innate hostility in both capitals towards each other," Glosserman,
deputy director and visiting professor at the Center for Rule Making
Strategies at Tama University in Tokyo, told CNBC.

**[The Belt and Road and the AIIB]{.underline}**, which finances
transportation networks, power stations and other infrastructure, **[are
key symbols of China's growing global stature. Japan]{.underline}**,
which has long backed the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, **[was
initially wary of the Chinese initiatives but increasingly sees
potential for opportunity.]{.underline}**

**[Well, I think the message that Abe wanted to convey was first and
foremost obviously to the Japanese people that their relationship is
very close.]{.underline}** I thought the imperial visit was very
successful largely because the new emperor and empress looked very
relaxed. **[They spoke in English. There were no interpreters. It was a
very strong debut, if you will, for the new emperor and empress on the
global stage.\]{.underline}**
I think there\'s also a message to be had in the region. **[Mr. Trump in
Tokyo, with all the pomp and circumstance, with even the irritations on
trade and that mixed signal in North Korea - it was clear that this is
an alliance that was vibrant, that was coherent and that was still being
deeply supported by both countries. That\'s the message Mr. Abe wants to
send to Pyongyang and certainly the message he wants to send to
Beijing.\]{.underline}**
KELLY: **[That pomp and circumstance extended to the appearance of Trump
2020 campaign banners. They were visible as the president was making his
way through Japan\'s streets.]{.underline}** Another of the events that
he attended was this sumo tournament. Why is Prime Minister Abe so
intent on courting President Trump?\
SMITH: **[Well, you know, you - the backdrop here, too, is the Japanese
people are not as critical of President Trump as many of the citizens of
our other allies in Europe, for example. The president and the prime
minister do have a reasonably strong working relationship. The Japanese
diplomats pointed out before the visit that they\'ve spoken or met 42
times since the president came into office.]{.underline}**\
KELLY: Forty-two times, wow.\
SMITH: **[An unprecedented amount of contact. So I think there\'s still
this sense that this is a good partnership and that Mr. Abe can make it
work.]{.underline}**

countries aim for a trade agreement on goods only but the United States
is pushing for a comprehensive pact that would also cover areas such as
services, investment, intellectual property and currency as a means to
reduce the trade deficit with Japan. Referring to upcoming trade talks,
the Trump administration has said it \"may seek to pursue negotiations
with Japan in stages, as appropriate\" \-- indicating the possibility of
first reaching a smaller deal that would not cover a full range of
issues.

### Japan Won't Abandon Nuclear Umbrella

#### Japan is critically dependent on the US nuclear umbrella and will accommodate the US to preserve its status

**Mainichi 18** (Mainichi Japan is a daily newspaper in Japan, 2/5,
"Japan\'s dependence on nuclear umbrella highlighted as it hails new US
policy",
<https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20180205/p2a/00m/0na/012000c>, Aly
M)

**[The Japanese government\'s open-armed acceptance of the United
States\' Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), which was recently released by
the administration of President Donald Trump, has underscored Japan\'s
dependence on the U.S. nuclear umbrella amid North Korea\'s nuclear and
missile development, a move running counter to its own efforts toward
nuclear abolition as the world\'s only atomic-bombed country as a result
of war.\
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono issued a statement on Feb. 3 after
the NPR was released, saying that the U.S. nuclear strategy clarified
Washington\'s commitment to providing extended deterrence to its allies
including Japan and that Tokyo \"highly appreciates\" the latest NPR
which showed such a policy. The statement also touched on nuclear
disarmament, saying that Japan will cooperate closely with the United
States to \"promote realistic and tangible nuclear disarmament\" while
responding to actual security threats, stressing Japan\'s reality in
which the country faces a nuclear threat by North Korea.\
A senior Foreign Ministry official said, \"While the belief in nuclear
abolition is important as ideal, this is not the time for it. \... It is
a fact that during the eight years of the administration of President
Barack Obama, China and Russia increased their military capabilities and
nuclear and missile threats by North Korea grew.\"\
Japan supported the Obama administration\'s call for a \"world without
nuclear weapons\" and its nuclear arms reduction policy, but had
conveyed its concerns to Washington over nuclear disarmament programs
that could lead to the weakening of deterrence, such as eliminating
nuclear arms to be mounted on cruise missiles. The latest NPR included
the deployment of nuclear cruise missiles, which served as one of the
reasons for Tokyo to welcome the policy.]{.underline}**

little "Abenesia" --- the downplaying of Japan's war record --- if that
is the price of a strong leader. Indeed, many in Washington regard Mr
Abe as the best Japanese prime minister in a generation.

**[[After]{.mark} two years under [rhetorical
assault]{.mark}]{.underline}** from U.S. President Donald Trump,
America's **[[alliances have]{.mark} somehow [held up. This year,
however]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the **[constraints]{.underline}** on
Trump's anti-alliance instincts **[are falling away, and a mix of
[internal and external pressures are endangering]{.mark} several [key
alliances]{.mark} at once. This trend is most visible [with]{.mark}
respect to [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The trans-Atlantic alliance has
been a target of Trump's ire for decades. Since taking office, he has
berated European leaders, waffled on America's Article 5 commitment to
protect allies, and even mused about withdrawing from the pact. Yet for
two years, largely thanks to the initiative of Congress and the
Pentagon, day-to-day relations with NATO remained relatively steady. The
administration increased spending on military activities meant to deter
Russian aggression. The alliance also took steps to improve its military
readiness and address unconventional threats such as cyberattacks and
information warfare. This progress, however, was largely dependent on
the presence of committed, pro-NATO officials in the American
bureaucracy. Those officials are becoming scarcer by the day. Secretary
of Defense James Mattis is gone, replaced by an acting secretary ---
Patrick Shanahan --- who seems more inclined to fulfill the president's
wishes. National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo are not anti-NATO, but their hostility to the European Union
poisons their relationships with European colleagues. Less visibly,
several key Pentagon and State Department officials responsible for the
NATO portfolio --- Assistant Secretary of Defense Robert Karem, Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense Thomas Goffus and Assistant Secretary of
State Wess Mitchell --- have left or will soon leave their posts. None
of this means that Trump is likely to withdraw from NATO. Bipartisan
support for a recent House resolution that seeks to prevent
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** from unilaterally **[[pulling
out]{.underline}]{.mark}** of that alliance is a clear warning of the
political price he would pay for doing so. **[The most likely
scenario]{.underline}** **[is that there will simply be less
constructive leadership from Washington]{.underline}** **[--- less
ability to propose new initiatives or even respond to allies' ideas ---
at a time when NATO confronts major challenges from Russia and
illiberalism is surging within the alliance. Things are no better on the
other side of the world]{.underline}**. **[The [Japan]{.mark}-U.S.
alliance has come through the first half of Trump's term in stronger
shape than one might have expected]{.underline}**, given the president's
three-decade history of Japan-bashing. **[Yet the [strains are]{.mark}
subtly [mounting]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Prime Minister Shinzo **[Abe's
assiduous personal cultivation of Trump did not prevent the president
from peremptorily]{.underline}** **[withdrawing from [the
T]{.mark}]{.underline}**rans-**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**acific
**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**artnership **[in his]{.underline}** **[first
week in office. Now, [Abe fears]{.mark} that [Trump may cut
a]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[grand [bargain with
China]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[at Japan's expense, [or]{.mark} make a
deal with]{.underline}** **[[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline}**
that similarly ignores Tokyo's security concerns. **[And while the
challenges in the Japan-U.S. alliance are merely simmering, the problems
may be coming to a boil in two other alliances. The U.S.-[So]{.mark}uth
[Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline}** **[alliance is in]{.underline}**
**[crisis, as [negotiations]{.mark} on the amount Seoul pays [to
defray]{.mark} the [costs]{.mark} of the American troop presence
[have]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[deadlocked]{.mark}. According to South
Korean officials, U.S. negotiators asked for a dramatic hike in these
payments, casting doubt on whether Washington was dealing in good faith.
The fact that the U.S. side has asked for annual renegotiations --- as
opposed to a multi-year agreement --- has heightened concerns that Trump
will simply]{.underline}** **[ask for more]{.underline}** again next
year. **[The resulting impasse may lead the Pentagon to stop paying
South Korean contractors]{.underline}** starting in the spring. **[It
could also give an American president who has never liked the U.S.
presence on the Korean Peninsula an excuse to begin reducing that
presence]{.underline}**. Last year, Congress passed legislation
prohibiting the Pentagon from cutting U.S. troop levels in South Korea
below 22,000 (from the current 28,000). That prohibition can be
circumvented, however, if the secretary of defense certifies that doing
so is in the national interest. **[Making the future of the alliance
even more precarious is that this internal dispute is happening at a
critical stage in U.S.-No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea
**[diplomacy. As the upcoming summit [with Kim]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Jong Un approaches, **[[Trump will]{.mark} surely be tempted
to]{.underline}** **[[make a big concession]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
will jump-start moribund negotiations on North Korean missiles and
nukes. **[Given how little he cares for the U.S. troop
presence]{.underline}** in the first place --- and given that he
suspended U.S.-South Korean military exercises after his previous summit
with Kim --- the president **[may try to]{.underline}** **[kill two
birds with one stone. He could withdraw some U.S. forces as a way of
appeasing Kim]{.underline}** and punishing the South Koreans for not
paying up. Doing so would be a gift to Pyongyang, Moscow and Beijing: It
would be a big step toward undermining the alliance with Seoul and
America's position in Northeast Asia. **[Finally, America's most
important alliance in Southeast Asia is also entering a danger zone. For
years, the U.S. has refused to clarify whether the Mutual Defense Treaty
with the Philippines covers the islands and reefs that Manila controls
in the South China Sea.]{.underline}** That ambiguity is meant to avoid
writing a "blank check" that Manila might cash by provoking China. Yet
given how rapidly China's expansionism is shifting the balance of
influence in the region, ambiguity is rapidly becoming untenable. Since
2012, when the U.S. failed to prevent Beijing from seizing control of
Scarborough Shoal, Filipino officials have worried that Washington
cannot deter the Chinese salami-slicing that is paring away their
country's sovereignty. Making matters worse, the U.S. has formally
clarified its commitment to defending the Japanese-administered Senkaku
Islands in the East China Sea, while evading questions about whether it
has a parallel commitment to the Philippines. Further fueling the crisis
is the fact that the Philippines now have a president --- Rodrigo
Duterte --- who is openly skeptical of the value the U.S. defense
commitment provides. **[As a result of all this,
[Philippines]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Secretary of]{.underline}**
National **[Defense]{.underline}** Delfin **[Lorenzana]{.underline}**
**[has been signaling that Manila [may]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[re-evaluate]{.mark} its [commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the
Mutual Defense Treaty if Washington doesn't clarify its position. Yet
the Trump administration has so far been silent, perhaps because
American officials sense that this issue will be a loser with a
president who sees alliances as burdens. A position of continued
American ambiguity will probably not lead Duterte to pull out of the
alliance. But it may reinforce his belief that Chinese power will
ultimately dominate Southeast Asia, and that Manila should accommodate
rather than resist the inevitable. That, in turn, would make it far
harder for the U.S. to rally the region against Chinese revisionism; it
would subtly but unmistakably erode America's position in Southeast
Asia. To be fair, **[the crisis of this particular alliance is not
really Trump's fault]{.underline}**. Reassuring an exposed ally ---
while also restraining that ally from unwise actions --- would test the
abilities of even a competent, committed administration. **[Yet the
chances that things could turn out badly, with the Philippines or any of
these allies, are only heightened by the fact that America currently has
a hollowed-out administration led by this particular president. Since
[Trump]{.mark} took office, U.S. foreign policy [wonks]{.mark} have
[worried]{.mark} that his presidency would be a period [of grave peril
for]{.mark} America's [alliances. This]{.mark} might be the
[year]{.mark} that [proves them right]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
