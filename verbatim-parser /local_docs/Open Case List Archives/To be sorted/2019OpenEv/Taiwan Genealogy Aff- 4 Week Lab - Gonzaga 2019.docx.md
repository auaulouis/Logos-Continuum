#### Just days after his election, Donald Trump received an historic telephone call from Tsai Ing-wen, the President of Taiwan, marking the first time in nearly 40 years that an American president has spoken directly with the leader of the ROC. Many celebrated the call as bold support for the democratic people of Taiwan against the "brutal" tyranny of China. Others criticized it for threatening to undermine America's delicate relationship and ratchet up economic and military tensions. This controversy has only been magnified by the Trump administration's recent approval of the sale of billions of dollars' worth of tanks, missiles and other military equipment to the ROC.

#### Revealingly, neither side of this debate thought it signaled anything like support for true Taiwanese independence or statehood. Taiwan exists in a permanent state of exception. Not subject to Chinese rule -- not a nation-state of its own. Taiwan demonstrates the crisis of modern sovereignty, and its people are the "bare life" of modern biopolitics.

It is well known that [the Taiwan Relations Act]{.underline} (1979)
[that currently governs Taiwan-U.S. relations]{.underline} was the
product of intense political lobbying and negotiation between the
Executive and the Legislative branches of the U.S. government following
President Jimmy Carter\'s decision to establish full diplomatic ties
with the People\'s Republic of China. Even before it was passed into
law, the TRA invited vociferous partisan debate within the United
States, as well as in the P.R.C. and the R.O.C. Curiously, what
interests participants in this debate are matters of principle and
interest (if not simply \'principal\' and interest - but the record of
that investment is beyond this essay). It is impossible to find writers
who seriously consider the significance of the TRA. For all writers, it
seems, the TRA is simply an expedient means, a way for the United States
of America to give de facto recognition to a front-line anti-Communist
State from which it severed ties for considerations of realpolitik. In
fact, the entire posture of realpolitik [serves to produce a
representation of Taiwanese people as victims, and unofficial diplomatic
relations as humanitarian aid or service. This discursive structure
(undeclared national emergency)]{.underline}, of course, [prepares in
advance the ground for ultimate military intervention.]{.underline}
Indeed, [security is the main concern of the document, which
\'authorizes\' various relationships in order \'To help maintain peace,
security, and stability in the Western Pacific.\']{.underline} What is
particularly remarkable about [the TRA]{.underline} is that it excludes
the government of Taiwan (the Republic of China) from diplomatic
relations, yet extends full validity to all agreements with \'Taiwan\'
in effect before the end of diplomatic relations. Bypassing the State,
the object of the TRA is either \'Taiwan\' or the \'people on Taiwan.
\'Significantly, the preposition on stands in sharp contrast to the
phrasing that precedes it: \'the people of the United States of
America.\' Internal State Department briefings about the island
reportedly refer sometimes to the \'Taiwans\' - a neologism that
[reflects]{.underline} with unprecedented clarity [the confusion between
population and territory that is at the heart of biopolitical power\'s
new configuration of sovereignty within the discipline of crisis
management and police power.]{.underline} Significantly, [the TRA does
not recognize a Taiwanese nation]{.underline} (which comprises 60% of
the ethnic mix on the island), [nor does it recognize identity based on
the classic postulate of possession and property. But it does recognize
\'life\' on the island.]{.underline} This minimal recognition recalls
once again Arendt\'s formula that links the decline of the nation-state
to the end of the rights of man. Before we consider the biopolitical
implications of this formulation, let us observe that the TRA\'s
management of State identity reminds us of the relation between the
Federal Government and local States within the U.S. States whereby local
states may not conduct independent diplomatic relations with other
foreign governments but may carry on all manner of commercial, cultural,
and representative links. Given Taiwan\'s current diplomatic isolation,
its position vis-vis the U.S. Federal Government is very much analogous
to that of a local State. This analogous inclusion of Taiwan within the
Federal constitution of the United States is further confirmed by
Section 4, Article 6, which states that for the purposes of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, Taiwan will effectively be treated as
an independent nation. In other words, documents (\'passports\') issued
by the authorities in Taiwan can be officially recognized by United
States government agencies as de facto national documents. Although we
might be tempted to construe these documents as \'travel documents,\'
the recent experience of Meichin Hsiao exenipl ifies Taiwan\'s entry
into a wholly different category. Hsiao\'s case became public in Fall,
2000: working as an advisor for Chen Shui-bien\'s minority (non-KMT)
government, Hsiao was threatened with legal action against illegal alien
labor because she did not have R.O.C. citizenship. A U.S. citizen, born
of a mixed Taiwanese (naturalized U.S.) and European American couple,
Hsiao held an X-series (overseas) R.O.C. passport. In a public
statement, Hsiao reported that when she consulted with the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT, the exceptional \'non-official\' American
Embassy established in Taiwan by the Taiwan Relations Act) about using
her X-series passport to enter the United States (in case she would
renounce U.S. citizenship), officials at AIT indicated that they could
not issue a U.S. visa to holders of an X-series passport who did not
bear documents showing permanent residency status and/or citizenship in
another country. AIT could only treat the X-series passport as a
\'travel document\' rather than\'a truly national passport; holding such
a passport, Hsiao would be treated by the U.S. government as a stateless
person.\" This interpretation of Hsiao\'s passport raises questions
about the status of R.O.C. passports in general: How can the U.S. view
regular (non-X series) R.O.C. passports as anything other than \'travel
documents\'? (i.e, as national passports), since they are issued by a
State which the United States does not recognize? The bearers of R.O.C.
passports enjoy rights and obligations according to U.S. law and the
protocols of U.S.-R.O.C. relations in place before the end of diplomatic
relations. However, the documents themselves do not refer to any State
recognized by the U.S. In this context, it is extremely difficult to
understand why Hsiao\'s Xseries passport would leave her to be
considered as anymore \'stateless\'than any of her compatriots by a
government that does not recognize any R.O.C. state to begin with.
Behind the apparent contradictions, [we must seek a new conceptual
category that fully accounts for the exception rather than attempt to
paper over the exception by reasserting our faith in the normalcy of the
rule.]{.underline} Hence, we propose that [for the U.S. government,
R.O.C. passports]{.underline} - which are admittedly not \'travel
documents,\' and yet refer to a State which the U.S. does not
recognize - [are primarily identification papers for an alien population
with a government and no state - i.e., a fully biopolitical labor force
-]{.underline} entering the discipline of naturalization. Here, the
manifestation of racism is fundamentally altered - nicely captured by
the concept of \'naturalization.\' Indeed, that to which these
\'identification papers\' refer is not an ethnicity in the classic sense
of the term - for that was the putative basis of nationality - but
[people apprehended simply as unqualified human life.]{.underline} In
this sense, we detect an important discursive continuity between the
ethnic identification codes of Martial Law and the TRA. Hence, [the TRA
should be seen as an exceptional measure that maintains Taiwan in the
space of the exceptional state of undeclared emergency, prolonging
Taiwan\'s sojourn at the very heart of the crisis of
sovereignty.]{.underline} From these two aspects of the TRA, we can see
that [the TRA effectively]{.underline} legislates treatment of
individuals from Taiwan according to a domestic U.S. law process that
essentially [substitutes life for nationality, population for
citizenship, and governmentality for sovereignty.]{.underline} In the
event that the life of an individual bearing Taiwan travel documents
residing in the United States was threatened by U.S. government agencies
or other non-governmental vigilante forces (such as White Supremacist
militia), that individual could not expect to receive the kind of
support accorded to individuals of sovereign powers such as U.S.
citizens abroad regularly receive. Under the TRA, Taiwan forms an
undemocratic security border within which an ethnic population without
citizenship is poised to acquire, given sufficient resources, U.S.
residency. The real scandal, however, is that relations with Taiwan are
handled under the protocols of U.S. domestic law. Our findings
essentially confer with Micheal Hardt and Toni Negri, who write: \'the
immanent concept of sovereignty \[i.e., that of global Empire as opposed
to territorial nationStates\] is inclusive, not exclusive. In other
words, when it expands, this new sovereignty does not annex or destroy
the other powers it faces but on the contrary opens itself to them,
including them in the network \... its space is always open.\'18 [The
recognition of a \'people on Taiwan\' given by the TRA establishes a
classic biopolitical category: live population, which]{.underline},
Arendt and then Agamben show by looking at stateless people, refugees,
and camps, [tends to reveal the emergence of a new political category,
that of \'life\' itself, life stripped of every determinate
identity.]{.underline} This reduction to bare life helps us understand
why Lee Teng-hui, first Taiwanese president elected by popular suffrage
(1 996), appealed to a concept of \'New Taiwanese\' identity by
recognizing community in the life on Taiwan. Hence, Lee\'s formula, that
Taiwan is a \'community of life\' (shengminggongtongt\~), is in fact a
politically acute assessment of Taiwan\'s current position, although it
is not something, as Lee thinks, that still awaits construction. The
accuracy of Lee\'s assessment requires that an equally critical thought
be applied to the contextual account of sovereignty.

#### To understand Taiwan's unusual position, it's not enough to look at current policy. The roots of Taiwan's exceptional status are not new. The island has changed hands between colonizer after colonizer since at least the 1600s. Its current situation, however, can be marked by America's military victory in World War II and the onset of the Cold War. 

#### In August 1950, just weeks after US troops arrived on the Korean peninsula ready to fight the threat of communism in Asia, General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers and functional colonial Governor of post-War Japan, delivered a speech outlining the beginnings of a significant evolution in America's understanding of its "western strategic frontier." No longer limited to the west coast of the continental US, where "menacing avenues of approach" were open to "any predatory force" out to get us, "all of this was changed by our Pacific victory." MacArthur proclaimed, "Our strategic frontier ... shifted to embrace the entire Pacific Ocean, which has become a vast moat to protect us as long as we hold it... It acts as a protective shield to all of the Americas and all free lands ... we control."

#### MacArthur's speech made clear the emerging strategic attitude toward this new "frontier." America was in the process of transforming the threatening vastness of the Pacific into a theatre of militarized control. At the core of MacArthur's argument was the strategic centrality of an unusual military asset -- an "*unsinkable aircraft carrier*" that, if lost, would neutralize our entire Pacific defense system and expose all "free nations of the Pacific basin" to inevitable "war of conquest."

#### America's "unsinkable aircraft carrier" was no typical military warship, but rather the perfectly situated island of Taiwan. Not a people. Not a state. But a weapon.

There is another perspective from which **[the modern history of
\'Taiwan\']{.underline}**12 [**reveals an enduring crisis of
sovereignty**-a crisis that is, in fact, common to East Asia, and ought
to be **related to the history of modern European (and Japanese)
imperialism.**]{.underline} This crisis is that of peoples subjected for
a long duration to the barbarism of sovereignty\'s imperative
normativity such that their political aspirations have been completely
informed by the horizon of national sovereignty. [In the wake of the
initial encroachment of Han settlers from the Ming Dynasty on aboriginal
populations, there ensues 400 years of colonial baton-passes between
Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, and Japanese Colonial States]{.underline},
interrupted by Ming rebels-turned-pirate kings and Qing Imperial
negligence, [which culminates in a \'perfect\' higher synthesis of
domestic-foreign State negativity: mercenary remnants of a fascist
State]{.underline} (the KMT Nationalist Party) [are transported into
puppet sovereignty by a **United States government that is deeply
preoccupied at the end of the Pacific War by its strategic agenda**: to
subsume Japanese sovereignty]{.underline} (ending Pan-Asianism) [and
**to establish a juridical-police framework in the
Pacific**]{.underline} (indeed, the entire globe), [which accords the
United States exceptional status]{.underline} (Iloam Chomsky will call
it an \'outlaw superpower\'\") [while criminalizing China]{.underline}
on account of its Communist aspiration (terminating the Communist
alternative to Pan-Asianism). Long before Communism, however, in the
ruins of Chinese Empire and the shaky Republic that followed (1 91 I),
sovereignty had been developing, informed by European and Japanese
colonial expansion. It had been developing into a state of exception for
quite some time. Here, it is worth mentioning once again the need for an
ongoing project to show that Chinese sovereignty was not inherited
directly from the lmperium in a contiguous lineage, but was rather
formulated in the exteriority of colonial power. Extraterritoriality,
rather than the Imperium, ought to be placed at the center, not the
encroaching margin, of our understanding of what sovereignty is for
modern China. For this reason, the typical historical periodization of a
\'semi-feudal, semi-colonial\' status should be seen as a crisis of
conceptual categories that calls for complete reformulation. We propose
instead that Chinese sovereignty was maintained in the status of
exception through the protocols of extraterritoriality, and that
exception has almost always been managed by the State policing its
territory and population (not \'defending the rights of citizens\').
Taiwan, as a colony acquired by Japan from the Qing Empire, largely
escaped the modern Chinese experience of sovereignty until 1945, when
the KMT invests Taiwan with American transport. Significantly, the KMT
governor\'s first act is to address the issue of sovereignty at the same
time he grants validity to the previous colonial codes. Following this
reintroduction of the permanent exception - a truly Chinese experience
of modern sovereignty - [there is a long period beginning with the
Korean War in which the international status of Taiwan is declared - by
Washington, acting as a police-judge - \'unresolved,\' while Taiwan
itself is ruled under the world\'s longest period of martial
law.]{.underline} Once again, [we are dealing with the exception made
permanent]{.underline} - right back in the modern Chinese experience of
sovereignty: a status of permanent exception. The total mobilization of
society maintained by the world\'s longest rule of martial law (1 949 -
1987) in Taiwan was largely based upon five key elements: the
identification of State interests with Party capital; the division of
sexual labor that on the on6 hand required a total mobilization of the
male population and on the other hand perpetuated a colonial
distribution of women into social immobility through categories of
either-prostitute-or-mother; the restriction of national space by
controlling access to the mountainous outback, the open sea, and the air
space above Taiwan; the discipline of \'national language\' as a cover
for instituting the privilege of a minority population; and finally the
reduction of \'citizens\' to mere populations and the system of ethnic
identification cards that maintained a distinction between \'Taiwanese\'
and \'Mainlanders\' (exiles from Mainland China who account for some 15%
of the actual population) while maintaining aborigines (5% of the actual
population) in remote spaces of restricted access. [Parallel to the
domestic rule of martial law, **the unilateral exercise of power by the
U.S.** since the end of World War Two]{.underline}14 **[has kept
sovereignty across the Pacific, and particularly in
Taiwan]{.underline}** (as well as China), **[in a virtually permanent
state of exception.]{.underline}** The proposition is worth repeating:
**[Since the WWll defeat of Japan, America rehearses the entire Western
Pacific region as a Theater of Operations in which it is the only
sovereign nation - in truth, a sovereign lawmaker and law enforcer, the
Judge-Police of the Pacific.]{.underline}** This history is as
well-documented as it is disavowed, although [its justifications are
simple: criminalize the enemy and reduce peoples in the region to
populations subjected to forms of power and productive relations that
actually cannot be understood through the model of sovereign politics,
yet which maintain political aspirations immobilized in the
desire-(of)-sovereignty.]{.underline} I will cite one pertinent example
of America\'s unilateral approach to sovereignty in the Pacific:
according to wartime accords, the powers at war against Japan should
have all been involved in drafting a peace treaty. However, the
emergence by 1947 of the Cold War, the Chinese Revolution in 1949, and
the Korean War in 1950, changed U.S. security considerations and the way
in which the U.S. occupation of Japan was conducted into a virtually
unilateral affair. Especially after the outbreak of war in Korea, Taiwan
was now included in the defense perimeter of U.S. containment policy.
Arrangements for the peace treaty with Japan, begun in 1947, followed a
similar course. China and Russia, whose armies had diverted the bulk of
Japanese land forces throughout the Pacific War, were excluded from
drafting the treaty. The final treaty, concluded in San Francisco in
1951, was a United States production. China did not attend the treaty
conference. Contrasted against this regime, the impunity, or again the
status of exception, &joyed by the East Asian nationalist State and its
U.S. competitor/aIly is particularly evident. [Faced with what must
strike any impartial observer]{.underline} (\'impartial\' means,
minimally, that we do not criminalize our enemies, and furthermore, we
recognize that our enemies do not constitute our politics as much as
those whom we simply banish or exclude) [as obvious, flagrant disregard
for sovereignty and international protocol]{.underline}, let me voice
what I believe to be common knowledge: [given the military weapons
systems in deployment since the end of World War Two, it is axiomatic
that control of Taiwan would allow a third power effective ability to
interdict the shipping lanes to and from Japan. Hence the description,
**\'Taiwan, the unsinkable aircraft carrier,\'**]{.underline} points us
not only to China but to Japan, as well. [If, we may suppose, Taiwan
were to come under Chinese sovereignty, would not the whole strategic
balance of U.S.-Japan production be seriously, perhaps fatally,
threatened?]{.underline} With Taiwan under Chinese control, japan would
perhaps have to consider much more seriously the prospect of a
Sino-Japanese alliance, rather than a U.S.-Japan security arrangement.
Hence, **[the entire United States strategy in the Western Pacific must
hinge upon maintaining a balance of power]{.underline}** between China
and Japan. [**One name for that \'hinge\' is Taiwan** - an area whose
sovereignty, arranged by the United States in collusion with occupied
japan, was unilaterally declared \'unresolved\' by the United States as
the Cold War crept into its post-War Pacific protectorate.]{.underline}
Other names are possible: obviously, Korea comes to mind; beyond any
specific example, however, it is important to observe that although the
four tigers (Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan) emerging out of
economic expansion in the 1980s were called \'countries,\' within a Cold
War logic **[they might as well have been named \'front-line States,\'
that is, States without a nation whose entire population is subject
(hostage) to the needs of Capital.]{.underline}**

#### MacArthur's statements were not some neutral description of abstract security principles, but rooted in very concrete racist attitudes about China and the rest of Asia. Maintenance of US military presence in Taiwan is necessary, he said, because it's "in the pattern of the Oriental psychology to respect and follow aggressive ... leadership," and "to pursue any other course ... would completely expose" us and our allies "to the lustful thrusts of those who stand for slavery against liberty, for atheism as against God." This discursive construction of China is not centrally about China. It's about America's identification of itself as a white, Christian, capitalist society. It's through representations of China that we have defined ourselves.

Institute at the Univ of Manchester, "'Threatening' China and US
Security: the international politics of identity," *Review of

In his analysis of the [China Threat Theory]{.underline} Chengxin Pan
argues that the 'threat' [is an imagined construction of American
observers.]{.underline}15 Pan does not deny the importance of the PRC's
capabilities but asserts that they appear threatening from
understandings about the United States itself. '\[T\]here is no such
thing as ''Chinese reality'' that can automatically speak for itself',
Pan argues. ['\[T\]o fully understand the US ''China threat'' argument,
it is essential to recognize its autobiographical
nature'.]{.underline}16 [The geographical territory of China, then, is
not separate from or external to, American representations of
it.]{.underline} Rather, it is actively constitutive of those
representations.17 The analysis which follows demonstrates that [**China
'threats' to the United States have to some extent always been
established and perpetuated through representation and
discourse**.]{.underline} Michel Foucault described discourse as 'the
general domain of all statements', constituting either a group of
individual statements or a regulated practice which accounts for a
number of statements.18 American discourse of China can therefore be
manifest as disparate and single statements about that country or as
collectives of related statements such as the China Threat Theory.
Ultimately, [American representations of China are discursive
constructions of truths or realities about its existence.]{.underline}
The article draws in part from the work of David Campbell who suggests
that [dangers in the international realm are invariably threats to
understandings about the self.]{.underline} 'The mere existence of an
alternative mode of being', argues Campbell, 'the presence of which
exemplifies that different identities are possible . . . is sometimes
enough to produce the understanding of a threat.'19 As a result,
[interpretations of global danger can be traced to the processes by
which states are made foreign from one another through discourses of
separation and difference.]{.underline}20 In this analysis it is
demonstrated that particular American discourses have historically made
the US foreign from China. Case study one for example demonstrates that
nineteenthcentury racial discourses of non-white immigrant Chinese
separated China from a United States largely defined by its presumed
Caucasian foundations. In case study two we see that [Cold War
ideological discourses of communism distanced the PRC from the
democratic-capitalist US. These types of discourses are shown to have
constituted a 'specific sort of boundary producing political
performance'.]{.underline}21 [Across the history of Sino-US relations
then when 'dangers' from China have emerged, they have always been
perceived through the lens of American identity.]{.underline} In
consequence, they have always existed as dangers to that identity. In
this analysis it is argued that **[a key purpose of depicting China as a
threat has been to protect components of American identity (primarily
racial and ideological) deemed most fundamental to its
being.]{.underline}** As such, representations of a threatening China
have most commonly been advanced by, and served the interests of, those
who support actions to defend that identity. The case study analyses
which follow reveal that this has included politicians and policymaking
circles, such as those within the administration of President Harry
Truman which implemented the Cold War containment of the PRC. It also
exposes the complicity of other societal individuals and institutions
including elements of the late nineteenth-century American media which
supported restrictions against Chinese immigration to the western United
States. It is demonstrated that, twice before, [this discursive process
of separating China from the United States has resulted in a crisis of
American identity.]{.underline} Crises of identity occur when the
existing order is considered in danger of rupture. The prevailing
authority is seen to be weakened and rhetoric over how to reassert the
'natural' identity intensifies.22 Case studies one and two expose how
such crises have previously emerged. **[These moments were characterised
by perceived attacks upon core assumptions about what the United States
was understood to be: fundamentally white]{.underline}** in the late
nineteenth century **[and democratic-capitalist]{.underline}** in the
early Cold War. Case study three shows that while today's China 'threat'
to US security is yet to generate such a crisis, we must learn from
those of the past to help avoid the types of consequences they have
previously facilitated

#### Specifically, US military support to Taiwan is implicated in the very constitution of America's capitalist identity. Taiwan exists for American imaginations. We don't sell them weapons so that they can assert their independence as a people or nation. We sell them weapons so that they remain an empty screen upon which we can project an image of the "free world" with America at its center.

In October 1949, following the Chinese civil war of the 1930s and 1940s,
Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China. Mao's communists
had defeated the Nationalists, or Kuomintang (KMT), of Chiang Kai-shek
who had long been supported by the United States. Following the
communist victory Washington rejected formal relations with Beijing and
maintained diplomacy with the Nationalists who retreated to Taiwan. In
February 1950 Beijing and Moscow signed the SinoSoviet Treaty of
Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Later that year Chinese
troops began fighting in the Korean War against the United States in
alliance with the Soviet-backed North. For decades China had been
perceived as an ally and Chinese and Americans had fought together in
the Second World War. Now, the country was reconstructed as a danger to
the United States. 'Red' China was a threat in the sense that American
troops were being killed in Korea. Nonetheless, [the course of Sino-US
relations during the early 1950s, and the response by the United States
to a new and seemingly imminent China 'threat', is once more
unexplainable without attention to the centrality of American
identity.]{.underline} The outbreak of the Korean War led President
Harry Truman on 27 June 1950 to order the American Seventh Fleet to
China to deter an invasion of Taiwan. Yet, at this time the PRC was
still to enter the war or become involved in hostilities with the United
States. China's capabilities were also broadly unchanged and until the
late 1940s it was argued that they could not threaten American security
in the short to medium term. In 1948 for example the Department of
State's Policy Planning Staff asserted that 'in any war in the
foreseeable future China could at best be \[considered\] . . . an
inconsequential enemy'.66 This view was reinforced in February 1949 by
National Security Council report (NSC) 41 which declared that China was
unlikely to threaten the US 'within the next generation or more'.67 The
American press had also responded to the establishment of the PRC in a
predominantly measured tone.68 From the early 1950s then [China became a
'threat' for reasons other than its physical and behavioural
attributes.]{.underline} Just like in the mid-to-late nineteenth century
'dangers' from China were not objectively observed. [They relied upon
processes of interpretation and representation and were again central to
prescribing the limits of political potentiality in Washington. The US
intervention in defence of Taiwan in June 1950 has been
predominantly]{.underline} (although not exclusively) [analysed in terms
of military and strategic considerations.]{.underline}69 The questions
posed have generally been 'why' questions; why did the United States
choose to defend an island now threatened by Chinese aggression? **[The
question which remains is how the defence of Taiwan was actually made
possible.]{.underline}** Even before its defeat to the communists
Chiang's Nationalist government was perceived as 'undemocratic, corrupt
and incompetent'.70 Wider concerns were raised that his regime was
violent and dictatorial. In October 1949 Secretary of State Dean Acheson
argued that the United States should not support Taiwan's 'discredited,
decayed KMT government'. As such, the island did not constitute a
priority to American security.71 How then was it possible for Washington
to mobilise support for Taiwan so soon after its government had been
dismissed as corrupt and dictatorial, against an 'enemy' so recently
identified as impotent?72 On 23 June -- just four days before the
Seventh Fleet arrived in the region -- Acheson reaffirmed Washington's
intention to abstain from military involvement there.73 As always,
[societal representations gave China's (and the United States') material
forces meaning and expose how US policies of the time could be enacted
towards a socially constructed rather than self evident China
threat.]{.underline} Furthermore, their exploration once again
demonstrates the continuing function of those policies in the
reaffirmation and protection of American identity. [When Truman
announced his intention to protect Taiwan he argued that]{.underline}
'\[t\]he attack upon Korea makes it plain beyond all doubt that
communism has passed beyond the use of subversion to conquer independent
nations'. [Communist forces]{.underline}, he asserted, [now represented
a direct threat to American security.]{.underline}74 Truman had
emphasised the criticality of shielding the United States from communism
but communism itself does not constitute a threat. It requires the
understanding that it represents a threat by contradicting the values of
non-communist states.75 Certainly, Taiwan was a key component in the
struggle for East Asian influence by allowing an American presence less
than two hundred kilometres from China. However, the Truman
administration did not consider formal alliances with every regime
threatened by a powerful neighbour, particularly those it regarded as
violent, undemocratic, and corrupt. **[American support for Taiwan not
only required an appreciation of the strategic realities of the Cold
War, but the understanding that it represented a noncommunist member of
the imagined Free World and an extension of the values of American
identity. Taiwan, like China, existed for American
imaginations.]{.underline}** To rephrase Fairbank, at any given time the
truth about the island was in their heads.76 As ever, [the material
forces which 'threatened' the United States were not the external
objects of circulating discourses about them.]{.underline} They were
inextricable from, and constitutive of, those discourses. Observes Bruce
Cumings: China, little known to most Americans . . . could become
'China', an issue that most people could be mobilized around because it
stood for nothing in the American mind and therefore could stand for
everything -- it was a tabula rasa on which the right-wing and the
expansionists could write.77 [China's capacity to become a threat had
not increased since so recently being dismissed, but power/knowledge now
made China threatening to American security.]{.underline} This is
illustrated by the Truman administration's 1947 Executive Order 9835
(the 'Loyalty Order'). Any individual or group affiliated with
communism, it declared, would be barred from employment by the federal
government.78 Communist values were anathema to the functioning of the
United States and as such had to be repelled. In the speech which came
to constitute his so-called doctrine Truman pledged American support for
'free people' threatened by communists.79 [Labelling communist dangers
'outside pressures' it was an act of foreign policy designed to protect
American identity.]{.underline}80 The same can be said of NSC 68.81
Written in 1950 this provided the blueprint for America's Cold War
response to communism.82 Numerable governmental statements of the time
were based upon its rhetoric and it drew inspiration from the
Declaration of Independence and American Constitution. In particular, it
emphasised the need to 'assure the integrity and vitality of our free
society'.83 Thus, [American representations of an imagined China threat
adjusted the boundaries of possibility beyond intervention in the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline} After its entry into the Korean War for example the
PRC was subjected to a trade embargo by Washington. Just as the
Exclusion Act of 1882 had restricted and controlled the Chinese at home,
Washington's early Cold War containment policies were the inscription of
discourses which separated 'threatening' China from the 'true' American
population. It was not a 'bridge' between states or the final product of
representation.84 The embargo was intended to slow China's development
but, like the Truman Doctrine and the Loyalty Order, served more
fundamentally to designate it an international pariah.85 [Washington's
policy reaffirmed China's (communist) foreignness from the
(democratic-capitalist) United States]{.underline}; as Truman explicitly
observed, the aim was to restrict trade 'between the free world and the
Soviet Union and its Satellites'.86 [Discourses of ideology had largely
replaced those of race in the protection of what it was but the US was
still imagined as a 'fully made' society vulnerable to 'civilisational
decomposition'.]{.underline}87 Once again, [acts of US policy themselves
were designed to prevent the erosion of American identity]{.underline},
as additionally illustrated by the Immigration and Nationality Act of
1952 which moved from a focus on racial or national origins to
affiliation with communism as a barrier to entry to the United States.88
During the nineteenth-century hysteria over immigration from China the
Chinese had been identified as a danger to white America. By the 1950s
representations of a China threat had adapted to new circumstances but
it remained fantasised and socially constructed. Once more
understandings of the 'threat' were challenged, for instance by writers
like Agnes Smedley and Edgar Snow. Smedley's Battle Hymn of China
recounted time spent in the company of the Chinese communists and was
deeply sympathetic towards Mao and his followers.89 Snow's Red Star Over
China, among his other works, was also notable for advancing resistance
discourses of a more civilised, less antagonistic PRC.90 By 1966 Red
Star alone had sold 65,000 copies in the United States.91 However,
societal rules of discursive exclusion marginalised ideas which competed
with those of Robert Rigg, for example, who argued that '\[n\]o fat and
sadistic warlords of China's history will ever be able to compete with
the grisly record of the militaristic Chinese communists'.92 Chinese
authors like Shaw-tong Liu further emphasised China's foreign, communist
identity. 'Red China's rulers are the new partners of the dictators of
Russia . . . I am one of those few fortunate fish who escaped through
the net', he explained.93 In addition, of course, the communist 'threat'
was promoted by Senator Joseph McCarthy who engineered an unparalleled
fear of communism and helped secure the discursive hegemony of a
'threatening' Red China.94 In cases like this [representations of China
were explicitly advanced as propaganda. They were functional, with a
clear purpose to demonise the PRC and present as unequivocal the dangers
it was understood to pose.]{.underline} The boundaries between
governmental Cold War McCarthyesque propaganda and ('lower level')
societal discourses, however, were regularly blurred as representations
of a China threat once more worked primarily for those who benefitted
most from its existence within American imaginations. Put differently,
while some were perhaps more directive and overtly instrumental than
others, to some degree American representations of a China threat were
each intended to present a common reality. As in the late nineteenth
century -- consciously or otherwise -- they were purposeful and useful,
with the power to frame parameters of behaviour in Washington. They were
again produced by those who attributed most significance to particular
understandings about the United States; in this case its commitments to
personal liberty, democracy, and free markets. The material realities of
the Korean War in particular were not inconsequential, but articulations
of the need to secure Americans from Truman's 'outside pressures'
introduced new avenues of behaviour. As Bostdorff explains: 'Korea
marked a turning point in the application of American foreign policy but
the Truman Doctrine was the symbolic turning point which made that
transformation possible.'95 As it had done more than half a century
earlier American identity entered a period of crisis. [Exaggerated
claims of a China threat were again responsible as the existing order
was considered increasingly endangered.]{.underline}96 [This developing
crisis once more worked in tandem with the discourses which distanced
China from the United States, reinforcing the construction of the threat
as rhetoric intensified over how to restore order.]{.underline} As
before, [the purpose of this latest crisis was to facilitate particular
avenues of US policy. Only this way can it be revealed how the United
States could legitimately defend a regime on Taiwan dismissed as unfit
to govern, while containing and marginalising a land and people so
recently declared unthreatening.]{.underline} Once more, [powerful
discourses had been advanced to enable particular policies towards a
constructed China threat. The Truman Doctrine in particular confirmed
understandings of American identity and made it unthinkable that
communism could succeed where capitalism and democracy might
fail.]{.underline} As ever, China was what American discourses allowed
it to be. Most importantly, [those discourses continued to frame the
boundaries of Washington's approach towards a China 'threat' which
existed primarily within and for American imaginations.]{.underline}

#### This permanent state of exception makes anything possible. The biopolitical power to protect life is the power to kill it, and as long as Taiwan is subject to the sovereign decision of America's militarized imagination, it is a life that can at any moment be rendered politically expendable.

An important detail about this extraordinary measure was that it only
applied to non-citizens of the United States; citizens suspected of
terrorism must be prosecuted under US criminal codes. Such orders invoke
what Schmitt called [the 'state of exception' wherein the existing legal
order is suspended and 'unlimited authority' seized by the sovereign to
meet a 'danger to the existence of the state']{.underline}. This, he
argues, [is the essence of sovereignty: 'Sovereign is]{.underline} he
who decides on the exception.'14 What is especially distinctive is not
only [the idealistic alignment of extra-judicial powers of life and
death with sovereignty, freed from]{.underline} the dominance of the
constitution and the [rule of law,]{.underline} but the enactment of an
uncertain threshold between law and the human in which the human can
disappear as a matter of executive power and whim 'in the interest of
the state, public safety and order'.15 Giorgio Agamben argues that 'what
is new about President Bush's order is that [it radically erases any
legal status of the individual, thus producing a legally unnameable and
unclassifiable being']{.underline}.16 Similarly, Judith Butler suggests
that [we are witnessing the emergence of]{.underline} 'normative
conceptions of the human that produce, through an exclusionary process,
a host of "unliveable lives" whose legal and political status is
suspended'; lives 'viewed and judged so that they are less than human,
or as having departed from the recognisable human community'.17 Agamben,
drawing on the work of Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, has done most
to describe and denounce the violent and impoverished conceptualisation
of life implicit in such a politics. He saw in the convergence of a
Schmittian theory of sovereignty and what Foucault termed 'biopolitics'
[a diabolical system of political and administrative power that reduced
human existence to 'bare life' (Homo sacer) that 'may be killed and yet
not sacrificed]{.underline}' -- Homo sacer being 'an obscure figure of
archaic Roman law in which human life is included in the juridical order
solely in the form of its exclusion (that is, of its capacity to be
killed)'.18 He sees such a simultaneously exceptional and [biopolitical
power at work in 'the Camp', which took]{.underline} on its most
horrific [form in the Holocaust but]{.underline} is [also in operation
at the US prisons in Cuba and Abu Ghraib, and,]{.underline} as
Suvendrini Perera19 has shown, [at immigration detention
centres]{.underline} like Woomera and Baxter in remote South Australia,
where [sovereign power is unchecked and life is taken hold of outside
the existing legal order]{.underline} (or at least within a radically
unstable and arbitrary one). The camp, Agamaben argues, is 'the
biopolitical paradigm of the modern' and [the state of exception is
becoming normalised and universalised: it 'tends increasingly to appear
as the dominant paradigm of government in contemporary
politics']{.underline}.20 Agamben thus issues a profound warning for
anyone concerned with interrogating modern conceptions of security --
which, after all, posit the sovereign nation-state as the collective to
be secured and abrogate to government powers to protect the 'life' of
this collective. Yet [life is not valued equally and its 'protection'
comes with a simultaneous seizing of life by power:]{.underline} . . .
in the age of biopolitics [this power \[to decide which life can be
killed\] becomes emancipated from the state of exception and transformed
into the power to decide the point at which life ceases to be
politically relevant]{.underline}. When life becomes the supreme
political value, not only is the problem of life's nonvalue thereby
posed as Schmitt suggests, but further, it is as if the ultimate ground
of sovereign power were at stake in this decision. In modern
biopolitics, [sovereign is]{.underline} he [who decides on the value or
nonvalue of life]{.underline} as such.21 In a world where life and
existence are defined biopolitically, and government takes on the
responsibility to secure, enable, regulate and order life, Agamben
argues (after Foucault) that [it is as if: 'every decisive political
event were double-sided:]{.underline} the spaces, the liberties, and
[the rights won by individuals]{.underline} in their conflicts with
central powers [always simultaneously prepared a tacit but increasing
inscription of individuals' lives within the state order, thus offering
a new more dreadful foundation for the sovereign power from which they
wanted to free themselves]{.underline}.'22 In this light, the 'active
defense of the American people' comes to sound sinister indeed, for
Americans and their Others alike.

#### Taiwan is one of many places that continues to exist in and between colonial occupation -- in and between competing imperial discourses -- but the people of Taiwan are not reducible to the "bare life" that biopolitical governance would cast them as. A collective of Taiwanese activists, scholars, and artists have come together to refuse these imperial imaginations. They work in solidarity with other decolonial and justice movements throughout the world, striving for a new kind of Taiwanese liberation that explicitly challenges any alignment with the American security establishment.

[**Taiwan exists in the between**. In historical terms, Taiwan has
existed, and continues to exist, in and between various iterations of
colonial occupation]{.underline}: from seventeenth-century Dutch rule
and the resulting Han settler colonialism to twentieth-century Japanese
occupation and the current colonial occupation of the lingering
Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist government. [Politically, Taiwan resides in
between the competing imperialist discourses of the People's Republic of
China, which has long articulated a goal of "retaking" or "reunifying"
the island it claims as a renegade province, and the United States, a
nation that has demonstrated an ambivalent stance toward Taiwan and
expressions of its independence. As such, **it has been appropriated as
a space on which to bargain the terms of US--China foreign
policy**]{.underline}---and negotiate away the island's right to
self-determination---since the 1970s. Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to the
People's Republic of China (PRC) culminated in the Shanghai Communiqué,
which expressed what would become the United States' guiding foreign
policy principle of One China, with Taiwan subsumed as part of China.
Taiwan was thus used as a negotiating tool to solidify a new partnership
between the United States and the PRC. The United States expressed its
acknowledgment for the idea "that all Chinese on either side of the
Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part
of China," and declared, "The United States Government does not
challenge that position." By 1979 the United States had pulled military
personnel out of Taiwan and severed governmental recognition of the
Republic of China. [In the space that is in and between occupation, and
in between US--China foreign policy, **Taiwan has been constituted by
colonial and imperial imaginations of its utility and
futurity.**]{.underline} The following collective statement represents
an intention to articulate and organize a new possibility for Taiwan and
its independence. It was crafted as a response to the controversial
December 2, 2016, phone call between Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-Wen,
and Donald Trump, which presented a new dynamic of in-betweenness, one
that catapulted the question of Taiwan independence from the margins to
center stage. Much of the reaction to the call revolved around two
general sentiments of panic and potential. US foreign policy experts
were anxious to preserve the One China status quo, while many in Taiwan
and the Taiwanese diaspora of the United States were cautiously hopeful
that it signaled the possibility for renewed American support,
especially in regard to independence. Taiwan independence, it is often
understood, cannot be practically achieved without the backing of
American militarized security. [In this statement, a growing contingent
of Taiwanese and Taiwanese American scholars, activists, artists, and
people in solidarity argue for a reimagination of the possibilities of
the in-between to move beyond tactics of dollar diplomacy and hopeful
anticipation of American approval, toward more sustainable projects of
**global solidarity with decolonial justice movements around the
world.** We offer this perspective as **an alternative to the hegemonic
logic under which Taiwan independence must be practically aligned with
American Empire and bolstered by American militarized
peace**.]{.underline} Instead, [**this collective statement attempts to
highlight the entrapment such thinking produces** and the violent
present moment that so-called US security has generated, especially
under Trump's increasingly fascist America.]{.underline} Within this
context, we intend for this statement to further transpacific
conversations, collaborations, and new configurations for imagining
Taiwan and the possibility of independence during these times. [The
December 2, 2016, phone call between Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-Wen
and American president Donald J. Trump focused new attention on the
issue of Taiwan independence.]{.underline} The call set off two dominant
reactions, both problematic. On the one hand, a troubling Taiwanese
national enthusiasm celebrated the possibility of American solidarity
with Taiwan independence under a Trump presidency. On the other hand,
so-called democratic Americans shuddered in fear at the idea that the
status of an autonomous Taiwan might be validated, putting at risk the
One China recognition policy that has proved profitable to the United
States since the late 1970s. [What is missing]{.underline}, however, [is
a critical understanding of the extreme danger of fostering Taiwanese
independence through a relationship dependent on the paternalism of
American Empire---made all the more perilous under the increasingly
fascist Trump administration---and the false security of US militarized
peace in Asia. **As scholars, activists, and artists in Taiwan and in
the diaspora of the United States, and as allies, we are concerned with
both Taiwanese independence and global justice.** Therefore, we urge for
a critical understanding of the inherent problems in aligning Taiwan
independence with the force of American Empire. American independence
and democracy itself have been built from violent contradictions to
liberty, including the genocide of indigenous peoples and the
enslavement of Africans, which continue today in different
forms.]{.underline} Indeed, the United States has historically benefited
from the direct suppression of both domestic and international
independence movements. Its One China foreign policy and advocacy for
maintaining the status quo in Taiwan is yet another example of this
pattern. Trump's stances have been unclear, at times expressing a
willingness to break from the One China Policy, and at other times
reaffirming it. His inconsistent stance on Taiwan poses fundamental
dangers to Taiwanese sovereignty and, moreover, continues the pattern of
America using Taiwan for its geopolitical interests. [Trump's America
First platform would merely continue a long history of US manipulation
of Taiwan for its own interests in the Asia Pacific.]{.underline} This
historical pattern has been most recently demonstrated through Trump's
comments suggesting that Taiwan may serve as a useful bargaining chip
for a trade deal with China. [Thus **Taiwanese liberation cannot rely on
a dependency model of liberty contingent on the political whims of the
United States**, which is especially volatile under Trump's
authoritarian brand of American governance. We also call attention to
the context of the racist, xenophobic, misogynist, and Islamophobic
platform of Trump and the immediate threat he poses to safety and
democracy in the United States and around the globe.]{.underline} His
executive orders to institute a Muslim ban, to construct a wall
separating the United States from Mexico, and to continue development of
the Keystone and Dakota oil pipelines are only a few examples of the
ways in which the Trump administration has advanced extremist policies
that institutionalize white nationalism, exploit the environment, and
threaten the tenets of democracy in America and abroad. [Therefore, we
find it troubling to align Taiwan independence movements with the
ongoing project of American Empire currently led by Trump.]{.underline}
Rather than depend wholly on America, [**we urge for Taiwanese
independence movements to not only distance themselves from the US
Empire and Trump but to build their freedom in solidarity with groups
marginalized by American Empire and with other global movements for
decolonization** (including indigenous rights movements in Taiwan as
linked to broader international indigenous movements). We must establish
strong international alliances with those who are putting their bodies
on the line for justice]{.underline}, just as a previous generation of
Taiwanese independence leaders have done. In the United States today,
[this includes the NODAPL, Black Lives Matter, and the ongoing queer and
trans liberation movements]{.underline}, to name just a few. In this
manner, [we can generate global attention for Taiwan independence by
**working in solidarity with other liberation movements** instead of
pandering to the political-economic desires of the US Empire. As
scholars and activists concerned with both Taiwan independence and
global justice, **we call for a Taiwan independence movement that
solidly rejects American military empire** and, instead, builds
steadfast alliance with marginalized communities and struggles for
justice around the world. Liberation must be collective if it will be at
all.]{.underline}

#### Taiwan is only one of many sites in the militarized geography of America's "Pacific theatre of operations." Our decolonial genealogy highlights the geo-historic construction of this space as an object of knowledge and biopolitical governmentality. This methodological intervention into the assumptions of status quo policymaking opens new avenues for knowledge production and dissent.

If the turn to [the transpacific and "the Pacific" points
to]{.underline} something new, we need to identify what has compelled
the emergence of the transpacific analytic and ask what are the new
questions and new sensibilities that cannot otherwise be illuminated
without a transpacific lens. Indeed, many scholars of various
disciplines have long investigated the Pacific region as [an important
space of violent contact, exchange, and asymmetries.]{.underline}2 I
submit that "transpacific" as a critical methodology must mean more than
the resignification of movements and interfaces across and within the
arena that happens to be called the Pacific. Instead, [we need to
clarify the specific geohistoric conditions under which that space has
been constituted as an object of knowledge and
nonknowledge.]{.underline}3 And if we were to grasp the full meaning of
the transpacific and/or the Pacific turn, [we need to scrutinize the
moment of its emergence and consider the interventions and contestations
it may reveal or conceal.]{.underline} I delineate **[a decolonial
genealogy of the transpacific---one that has been articulated and
rearticulated as a transnational Asian/American critique of the United
States' militarized colonial presence in Asia and the Pacific
Islands]{.underline}**.4 In doing so, the following discussion
[introduces a conjunctive critique of the transpacific as a critical
methodology by which to consider alternatives to transwar,
interimperial, Cold War formations.]{.underline}5 In my view, [the
transpacific analytic is particularly urgent in the new century because
it compels us to confront the structuring legacies of the transitional
moment from World War II to the onset of the Cold War.]{.underline} At
this transwar juncture, **[the vast areas of Asia and the Pacific
Islands that were formerly colonized or occupied by the Japanese Empire
were reorganized and then mobilized in an attempt to secure the United
States' geopolitical ascendancy]{.underline}**, even as the region
witnessed the waning of formal European colonial rule. [While American
supremacy could not have been achieved without military dominance and
control over the overseas territorial possessions in Asia and the
Pacific Islands]{.underline}---which can be traced back to the end of
the nineteenth-century wars against the Spanish Empire and the
Philippine Republic---**[it is also true that the United States'
midcentury ascendancy hinged on the ability to govern through the
rhetoric of liberty, rights, freedom, and American sacrifices for world
democracy.]{.underline}** As American Cold War studies scholars have
invariably noted, in the global Cold War rivalry [the disavowal of
formal colonialism and white supremacy became a US foreign policy
concern of utmost urgency because of the need to mobilize the Third
World countries, many of which were then emerging as new
nation-states.]{.underline}6 Yet it often goes unacknowledged that the
rhetorical force of the United States' "empire for liberty," and its
disavowal of racism and colonialism in particular, would not have been
as effective without showcasing Japan's post-surrender rehabilitation
through America's "good war" narrative. The narrative assumed that prior
to the war Japan was a nation lagging in modernity and that it had
failed to cultivate its latent potential to embrace liberal ideals until
it was vanquished militarily and then reborn under American tutelage.
Moreover, area studies knowledge produced during the transwar decade
gave academic credibility to such perceptions about Japan. Stories about
how "Japanese women" in the mainland were liberated and given rights
under General Douglas MacArthur's directives---along with various other
democratic reforms under the US occupation---were widely disseminated in
this context. In other words, to the extent that this transwar juncture
necessitated a radical epistemic shift for the ensuing "American
century," the knowledge about the liberation and rehabilitation of the
nonwhite, non-Western former enemy took on special significance in ways
that were unfathomable in the Atlantic front. That the "good war"
narrative of Japanese women's liberation continues to give legitimacy to
America's just war claims in the turn-of-the-new-century war against
terror suggests the enduring power of such transpacific knowledge
production, and just how discursively and geopolitically integral Asia
and the Pacific have been for the maintenance of US global dominance.7
And yet, discourse about the US Empire and its imperial formations
largely remains indifferent to their constitutive entanglement with the
Japanese Empire. Conjunctive critique of the transwar, transpacific
connections not only helps us see that the US Cold War Empire cannot be
effectively framed as a critical analytic unless the midcentury
relationship with Japan is simultaneously scrutinized. It also
necessitates a critique of knowledge production about Japan's colonial
empire and what its imperializing practices meant varyingly to
modernity, race, and visions for the new world. Importantly for our
context, such a methodology in turn reveals what the transwar,
transpacific entanglement has enabled and sustained. By using Japan's
imperial modernity as a foil for the post--World War II American
justice, the United States successfully mobilized the postindependence
Asian nations' network of free market client-states in Taiwan, South
Korea, and the Philippines to maintain the militarized security of
transnational capital. At the same time, to the extent that the
mobilization of these spaces was aimed at containing the Chinese
Communist Party's reach, such transpacific Cold War formations came to
dominate post--World War II inter- and intra-Asian associations with
China, regardless of whether this China was imagined as a threat,
opportunity, hope, or even in disavowal of its sovereign presence.
Furthermore, [the American "empire for liberty" enabled by such inter-
and subimperial connections emerged simultaneously as an "empire of
bases." The US overseas basing system has confiscated indigenous lands,
created extralegal spaces of exception, either through base-leasing
agreements or by recolonization, and exerted sovereign influences over
local politics, sociality, and economic life.]{.underline}8 A
transpacific analytic attentive to such transwar specificities and
conjunctions can bring to light the overlapping and uneven ways in which
Cold War imperial formations contained thoroughgoing decolonization at
various locales across Asia and the Pacific. Elaine Kim and Chungmoo
Choi's Dangerous Women: Gender and Korean Nationalism (1998) was perhaps
the first to critique the colonial continuation under the Cold War
postcoloniality in the aftermath of World War II. By turning a critical
gaze on the transpacific geopolitical dynamics and its historical
sedimentation, Kim and Choi brought to light for the first time in the
English language the transwar, transpacific connections among Japanese
colonialism, US Cold War military-security imperialism, and
postindependence Korean nationalism. They stated succinctly:
"Twentieth-century Korea is a palimpsest of multiple layers of Japanese
colonialism and neo-imperial domination, especially by U.S. hegemony,
which superimposed its systems on the political and social
infrastructures of Japanese colonial rule. . . . Because of the direct
installation of the U.S. military apparatus at the end of World War II,
South Korea, like many other former colonies, never had an opportunity
to decolonize in the true sense of the word."9 A collaborative exchange
between Korean studies and Korean American studies scholars, Kim and
Choi's project exposed the selective erasure and disciplinization of
knowledge that have long been sustained by the separation of area
studies from US ethnic studies. By treating "Korea"---over there and in
diaspora---not as a stable object of inquiry bound by the nation-state
framework but as a site of erasure and demarcation, Kim and Choi's
contribution marked the emergence of a critical transnational feminist
epistemology that cut across the disciplinary and geographic boundaries
of Asian studies and American studies. Importantly, [this genealogy of
the transpacific does not deflect attention away from the US-centered
investigation but brought to the fore the Asian American critique of the
transpacific US imperial formation.]{.underline} The recently published
edited volume by Janet Hoskins and Viet Thanh Nguyen, Transpacific
Studies: Framing an Emerging Field (2014), most forthrightly put forward
"transpacific studies" as an emergent field where new academic agendas
can be pursued.10 [The prefix trans- in this context is meant to capture
the Pacific as a geographic space of movement and interface---of people,
capital, cultural products, and labor.]{.underline} Hoskins and Nguyen
have built on earlier interventions by such scholars as Rob Wilson and
Arif Dirlik, whose seminal work illuminated the oppositional regional
visions of the Pacific in the latest stage of global capitalism. The
crucial difference, of course, is that while for the latter Japan was
the United States' rehabilitated transpacific partner, the former is
concerned with the People's Republic of China and its increasing
military, political, and economic influence, especially in Southeast
Asia. In this sense, the volume reflects the renewed Cold War
sensibilities of our current moment, in which China's increasing global
presence has begun to shift geopolitical dynamics. As one contributor
succinctly put it, Hoskins and Nguyen's collaborative project offers its
"own interpretations of the term 'Transpacific' as a replacement of the
older, now outmoded 'Pacific Rim.'"11 In their "Introduction" Nguyen and
Hoskins define the contours of transpacific studies by enlisting
practices of exchange and travel that are commonly found across the
Pacific as potential research subjects. For example, they highlight
remittance as an important example of [nonlinear and unscripted
transpacific practices]{.underline} to [present **a vision of the
Pacific as not an object of imperial desires but a "contact zone" (2)
whose history is defined "not only by conquest, colonialism, and
conflict, but also the alternate narratives" (3) of local epistemologies
and behaviors.**]{.underline} Nguyen and Hoskins furthermore distinguish
their transpacific studies from foregoing ones by proposing to "include
the insights of queer perspectives" (16). Analytic of queer diaspora is
not necessarily a distinct property of transpacific inquiries; it has
generated equally rich discussions in other geographies by unsettling
accepted notions of origins and the telos of movements, communities, and
belongingness. Still, the deployment of queer diasporas is of prime
importance, according to Nguyen and Hoskins, because they not only
destabilize heteronormative assumptions and categories that feed
capitalist imaginaries but also question academic desires that seek
stability, comfort, and the authenticity of "disciplinary homes" (16).
Queer diasporas are seen at once as an analytic and as living actors,
both of which "refuse" reproduction and capitalist production. Hoskins
and Nguyen thus offer an ethnographically grounded analytic for
investigating and theorizing the multidirectionality and contradictory
effects of circulations, transactions, and mobility/immobility. Earlier,
in The Trans-Pacific Imagination: Rethinking Boundary, Culture, and
Society (2012), Naoki Sakai and Hyon Joo Yoo deploy the transpacific
designation in their attempt to expose and challenge the national
ontology of two area studies: American studies and Asian studies.12
According to Sakai and Yoo, [East Asia as a geopolitical configuration
is inseparably and transpacifically tethered to US imperial dominance,
which is simultaneously enabled by the US--Japan alliance and successful
mobilization of formerly colonized nations.]{.underline} The
[transpacific studies]{.underline} Sakai and Yoo envision [is aimed at
deconstructing the nation, nationalism, and the national ontology, but
most important the assumptions that feed the binarism of the universal
West and the provincial Rest.]{.underline} According to Sakai and Yoo,
such assumptions have been transpacifically formed increasingly since
the mid-twentieth century. They state, "What is indubitably manifest in
trans-Pacific hegemony is the operation of the binary of the West and
the Rest" (6). Moreover, nationalism and national formations across the
Pacific have been integral to US-led geopolitical dynamics. Nationalist
attempts to counter such a hegemony, according to their view, remain
within the frame of identification and recognition vis-à-vis the West.
Sakai and Yoo's objective is "to produce the trans-Pacific as a new
paradigm of Area Studies that will overcome the dominant mode of
imagining East Asia and discover the grid of new regional configurations
beyond the neo-imperial design" (37). Their project then proposes to
claim transpacific as a term that at once illuminates and questions the
geopolitical dynamics of knowledge production.

# Biopolitics

## Sovereign Exception

### Taiwan State of Exception

#### The Taiwanese people exist in a state of exception, treated as "garbage human beings" to be thrown away for the needs of the global biopolitical community, enabling extreme forms of violence

**Hung 2012** \[Ruyu, Prof of Education at National Chiayi University,
Taiwan, "Being human or being a citizen? Rethinking human rights and
citizenship education in the light of Agamben and Merleau-Ponty,"
*Cambridge Journal of Education* 42.1, GDI-JCR\]

Firstly, [the so-called global community that includes all human beings
and their differences only exist on the theoretical level.]{.underline}
The formation of the global community so far remains within the
international and regional contexts. The inclusion of some people as
members is indeed an exclusion of others. For example, the establishment
of the EU distinguishes European citizens from non-European citizens.
Paradoxically, not all non-European citizens are non-Europeans since the
EU does not include all European countries as member states. According
to Etinne Balibar (2001), the birth of the EU with the appearance of the
concept of Civis Europeanus results in the uneven access to citizenship
and nationality through three very subtle metamorphoses: turning
foreigners into aliens; turning protection to discrimination; and
turning cultural difference to racial stigmatisation. He thus describes
the phenomenon amongst the European people as 'European Apartheid'. The
establishment of an international community distinguishes members from
non-members. Even the biggest international organisation -- the United
Nations (UN) -- does not include all states in the world. The
application of Taiwan as a UN member has been declined on many occasions
since its legal status has not been recognised. But recognised by whom?
[**That the recognition of Taiwan's status is not determined by the
Taiwanese themselves shows the illusion of universal equity in the
global world.**]{.underline} Moreover, there is a hierarchy in the UN
organisation privileging certain members. For example, the United
Nations Security Council (UNSC), one of the principal organs of the UN,
consists of ﬁve 'permanent' members and 10 'non-permanent' members.
Besides, the other states that are members of the UN, but not of the
Security Council, may join the discussions but have no power to vote
afﬁrmatively or negatively on any substantive matter. The purposes of
this international global community are to maintain international peace
and security ... to develop friendly relations among nations based on
respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of
peoples ... to achieve international co-operation in solving
international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian
character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and
for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex,
language, or religion. (Article 1, Charter of the United Nations) These
purposes are targeted at a global community within which
indiscriminative equity and respect for human rights can be widely
realised. Yet in reality the UN functions on the basis of distinction,
exclusion and hierarchism. This can also be said of the other regional
political communities and their organisations. Secondly, in respect of
the individual, Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben has highlighted the
mechanism of homogenisation and exclusion implied in the process of
politicalisation. This view helps us to problematise the evaluation of
the concepts of citizen and human being as equals and to expose the
implied exclusion. Agamben (1998) takes up Foucault's (1978) idea of
'biopower' and Arendt's (1958) distinction between zoe (natural life)
and bios (political life). The relationship between these ideas may be
articulated as follows: [biopower turns]{.underline} zoe -- or [natural
life, into]{.underline} bios -- or [political life, through deﬁning a
realm of bare life.]{.underline} Bare life denotes at the most basic
level -- a living human being. Foucault views a human being as the
product of a series of procedures conducted on life as a site of
regulation. Resonating Foucault's idea, Agamben points out that [the
human is produced by the exclusion of the inhuman. The human denotes a
politically qualiﬁed form of life]{.underline}, i.e. bios or citizen,
and the inhuman the zoe and the bare life. The distinction between the
human and the inhuman is drawn by means of the politicalisation of
natural life. [Politicalisation is a process of distinction between
those who can be included and those who cannot. The realm of bare
life]{.underline} -- which is originally situated at the margins of the
political realm, and order -- [gradually begins to coincide with the
political realm. And exclusion and inclusion, outside and
inside]{.underline}, bios and zoe, right and fact, [enter into a zone of
irreducible indistinction.]{.underline} (Agamben, 1998, p. 9) [This
process of **politicalisation is executed 'through abandonment of
natural life to an unconditional power of death**, that is, the power of
sovereignty']{.underline} (Mills, 2006, p. 5). Moreover, '\[i\]t is in
this abandonment of natural life to sovereign violence -- and Agamben
sees the relation of abandonment that obtains between life and law as
"originary"--that bare life makes its appearance' (Mills, 2006, p. 5).
[The mechanism of abandonment of natural life is executed by authority's
demarcating a 'realm of bare life' as well as a 'state of exception'
within which individuals are bare life, who no longer live inside or
outside of the political realm, neither alive nor dead, but survive in
suspension. **Concentration camps, refugee camps and prisons, for
example, are such zones of exception.** People who are living in these
places are bare life.]{.underline} They are entitled neither to
citizenship nor to human rights. [This zone is a realm of
indeterminancy, within which are lives whose legal status is
undecided.]{.underline} '\[T\]he state of exception is neither external
nor internal to the juridical order, and the problem of deﬁnite it
concerns precisely a threshold, or a zone of indifference, where inside
and outside do not exclude each other but rather blur with each other'
(Agamben, 2003, p. 23). Agamben's ideas of bare life and the state of
exception shed light on our understanding of 'human being' and
'citizen,'' the qualiﬁed' and 'the unqualiﬁed' or 'the right one' and
'the unright one.' According to Agamben (2003), the state of exception
is a paradigm of government whose sovereignty can be shown in its
authority to decide the scope of legislation and jurisdiction. In other
words, the sovereign demarcates the legislative and juridical sphere and
also decides who are and who are not within this sphere. People within a
particular community are the objects to which laws and rules are to be
applied. They have the membership of a certain group. This can be
understood as citizenship. Lynch (1992, p. 10) describes citizenship in
its simplest sense as having 'to be equated with nationality and
membership of the nation state.' However, the deﬁnition of the scope of
group changes with time. Lynch (1992) gives a brief introduction as
follows. In ancient times, the membership indicated residency in a city
or city-state or empire as in the case of civis romanus. In medieval
Europe citizenship 'was belonging to local city-republic or petty
princedom' (Lynch, 1992, p. 10). As the age of nationalism developed, so
did people believe that membership of a nation-state justiﬁes
citizenship and their rights to be defended against other nation-states.
In this sense, nationality is the basis for one to be entitled to
citizenship and rights under the protection of a nation-state. In a
similar tone, Balibar (2001, p. 18) states, 'We discovered that
political rights, the actual granting and conditions of equal
citizenship, were the true basis for a recognition and deﬁnition of
"human rights".' In light of Arendt, Balibar points out that citizenship
and nationhood are shaped as closely associated through the process of
institutionalisation of nation-state. However, the distinction between
nations and states are undeniable, which marks the difference between
citizens of different countries. After World War II, the boundary of the
community justifying citizenship was challenged by multifarious factors
and so was relocated within a context wider than the framework of
nationality. There also appears the concept of global citizenship, which
is located within an international or a cosmopolitan context. This
concept of citizen and citizenship seems for many to be more open and
inclusive to accept more people as members of a community. If the whole
world is taken as one global community, everyone can be included as an
equal member. In that case, everyone in this world has as equal
membership and citizenship as any other and thereby has equal
entitlement to human rights. This view to me is too optimistic to be
true. There are two points that I intend to propose to object to the
view of global community. First of all, [a global community which
includes everyone and everything is a collectivist and totalitarian
utopia within which the multifarious differences among people could be
underestimated and reduced.]{.underline} Secondly, the inclusion and
tolerance of the other that can be allowed only exists within the
boundary of this group, which seem to indicate minimal tolerance and
inclusion of the other that does not belong to 'our group.' In respect
of the ﬁrst point, we may ﬁnd that, as the biggest international and
global community, the UN does not include and treat all countries with
equal respect and thereby people do not enjoy equal rights. Although the
UDHR claims: 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and
rights' (Article 1), the practices of the UN seem to translate the
Declaration of Human Rights into a Declaration of Citizens' Rights since
one must be a citizen, a member of a community (e.g. a country or a
nation-state) that is recognised by the UN, in order that his or her
rights can be recognised and protected. People who are not members of
such states or whose countries are not recognised, in Agamben's terms,
are living in a state of exception. [**The Taiwanese, in this sense, are
people in a state of exception.**]{.underline} Their nationality and the
validity of their passport are questioned by people in different
countries and, sometimes, by themselves. They are human beings but not
citizens [since Taiwanese citizenship is put into question when
Taiwanese nationality is still in limbo. **Besides the Taiwanese,
prisoners, refugees, migrant workers, homeless or asylum seekers are the
people in the state of exception**]{.underline} (Agamben, 1998). [The
stateless, homeless, migrant workers, asylum seekers, prisoners and
refugees are those who are taken as non-citizens and not entitled to
rights.]{.underline} In Balibar's (2001, p. 25) resounding words,
**[these people are taken as 'garbage humans', 'to be "thrown" away, out
of the global city']{.underline}**. They are the people to be seen as
'ﬁxed in their homelands, i.e., their mere existence, their quantity,
their movements...' because 'they look "the same" (Balibar, 2001, p.
26). Implied in this taken-for-granted practice is a neglect of
individual difference and idiosyncrasy -- people are recognised by their
membership of a particular group, especially nationality, not by their
own personal characteristics. The establishment of a global community
includes everyone at the risk of reducing individual difference. In
respect of the second point, the intention of establishing a completely
global community for global citizenship could imply maximal inclusion,
on the one hand, and, on the other, the greatest exclusion. As Iris
Marion Young (1989, p. 252) has pointed out, 'The ideal of public realm
of citizenship as expressing a general will, a point of view and
interest that citizens have in common which transcends their
differences, has operated in fact as a demand for homogeneity among
citizens.' This suggests that a person who neither can be homogenised
nor belongs to this community will be expelled (and labelled as not
qualiﬁed). One must be a member of the community or he/she cannot be
recognised as a qualiﬁed person -- a citizen. Theoretically, no one
should be excluded. Practically, those who cannot or will not be
assimilated in the group that most people belong to are expelled into
the state of exception. According to Agamben (1998), [the means which is
often used to distinguish qualiﬁed people from the unqualiﬁed ones is
the juridico-political system executed by the sovereign
authority.]{.underline} The measures of homogenisation, in my view, can
be addressed in Balibar's (2003) terms of ['security
practices']{.underline} which [are designed to differentiate civilised
peopled from barbarians, humans from subhumans, legal residents from
illegal transients.]{.underline} Although Balibar's (1991, 2001, 2003)
main concern is on the framing of citizenship in Europe, his discussion
on the construction of the European identity and the resulting violence
and discriminating imposition of borders between Europe and non-Europe
can be extended to the wider context and echoes my understanding of
Agamben. [The sovereign authority decides who can or cannot be members
of a community, who can or cannot be politically qualiﬁed citizens under
the control of the juridico-political system. 'The function of the
sovereign exception is continually to delineate a threshold between
inside and outside that makes law possible']{.underline} (Spinks, 2001,
p. 27). [People who are classiﬁed as outsiders]{.underline}, e.g.
aliens, prisoners, and refugees, cannot enjoy all the privileges under
domestic and normal rules and laws. They are not one of 'us.' They are
not entitled to citizenship. [These people could be put into the zone of
exception such as state of exile, detention or emergency.]{.underline}
They are subject to criminal laws.

### Rethinking Key to Taiwan

#### Freeing Taiwan from the permanent state of exception must move beyond status quo models of nation-state sovereignty. Taiwan's exceptional status points the larger global crisis of sovereign biopolitics where we are all potentially bare life. We must refuse this normative framework of international relations.

**Solomon 2004** \[Jon, Assistant Prof in the Department of Futures
Studies at Tamkang University, Post-doctoral research fellow in the
Society for the Humanities at Cornell University, "Taiwan Incorporated:
A Survey of Biopolitics in the Sovereign Police's Pacific Theater of
Operations," *Traces* 3, p.245-51, GDI-JCR\]

Our research shows that [Taiwanese sovereignty needs to be seen as
something that is included, virtually in domestic terms, within the
theater of operations open to the sovereign police]{.underline} - U.S.,
Chinese, or otherwise. In the case of Taiwan, [the terms \'theater\' and
\'act\' must be rigorously taken at face value]{.underline}: this will
help us remove the various productions of optical representation and
dissemination (such as Hollywood films) out of the obfuscating category
of so-called \'cultural imperialism\' and begin to theorize them in
terms of violence and logistics. [This sort of genealogical perspective
has the advantage of obviating]{.underline} culturalist [assumptions
that obfuscate the]{.underline} crucial [articulation between
sovereignty and]{.underline} subjective technologies during [the
transition from Colonialism to Cold War. A \'theater of operations\'
comprises]{.underline}: logistics, communications, optical
representation, and the capability to concentrate levels of disciplined
force. As Paul Virilio persuasively argue\^,\^\" twentieth century
history shows that it is impossible at the limit to distinguish between
advances in image reproduction technology and military weapons systems.
The term \'theater of operations\' was originally conceived during the
global conflicts of the 20t\" century as a concept for strategic
warfare. Perhaps we can use it today to depict, rather than delineate,
[the space and speed of power in an age when territorial sovereignty
breeds only insecurity]{.underline}. In applying the term to depict [the
status of sovereign power in this age]{.underline}, we also wish to
evoke important work by Jean-Luc Nancy that shows how \'operativity\'
has become an essential figure for understanding the predicament of
modern sovereignty. In Nancy\'s work, \'operativity\' [describes the
constitution of a]{.underline} subject (for instance, a [national
subject) through the production and maintenance of a common
essence]{.underline}.\~\' We use the term \'theater of operations\' to
describe the space opened by modern sovereign power and the space within
which it operates. The very designation \'Taiwan Relations Act\'
provides us an important clue, one that has been studiously ignored by
thinkers of Taiwan\'s predicament. As the name of that truly
performative \'act\' so readily implies, in order to think Taiwan, it is
necessary to think sovereignty not in terms of autonomy, but in terms of
relation. In fact, one might characterize much of the new thinking in
post-Marxism and post-colonialism as a turn from the thinking of a
politics of the self-sufficient subject and sovereignty to a thinking of
an ontology of relationship, of the proletariat as precisely that which
is not a subject, and of the sovereign as that which is based on a
permanent exception. As Hardt and Negri sum up, the concepts of modern
national community, however, \'make the relation of sovereignty into a
thing(often by naturalizing it) and thus weed out every residue of
social antagonism.\"\* The authors of Taiwan\'s Legal Status are indeed
aware of the non-normative implications of sovereignty. Because Taiwan
has never been constituted as a stable sovereign power, the authors must
admit that an exclusively international framework, that is, a framework
based exclusively on the normativity of an international community of
sovereign States, is insufficient to explain Taiwanese history.\" Yet
there is no attempt to use this platform to seek a Taiwanese
independence that would challenge the construction of precisely that
normativity which has denied Taiwanese their own independence. As the
Chinese title of the work \'Taiwan\'s position within international
law\' suggests, the book is primarily an attempt to fix the boundaries
of the local constructions of sovereign power exclusively within a
juridical discourse of supranational right. Such discourse represses
historical difference. We never ask why sovereignty has become such an
obsessive question around Chinese history and East Asia in general any
more than we pose questions to the ponderous construction of
international law\'s \'surplus of normativity and efficacy.\'24 In place
of these radically transformative questions, there is endless debate
within the framework of cultural difference and cofiguration: did
Chinese possess a conception of sovereignty? and/or what was the
difference with a \'European\' concept+/practice? Whereas an earlier
school of American sinologists, represented by John Fairbank, assert
that sovereignty was an alien concept brought to China with the
\'Western Impact,\' a later generation of scholars, led by James
Hevia\'s path-breaking work, asserts that, yes, China knew of
sovereignty, but with a difference. To know whether China is the same or
different is the obsession of a culturalism that never examines the
desire motivating such massive institutional production of knowledge.
Surely, it is because of a specific kind of power within history that we
feel we must come up with an answer to the cluestions of identity and
difference posed by the desire-(of)-sovereignty. Yet when we look at the
history of sovereignty\'s desire as one of failure, we think it is
precisely these answers to which questions must be addressed if we are
to avoid reproducing the normative desire of sovereignty itself.
Considering just how explicit Taiwan\'s LegalStatus is with a litany of
rapacious, : unethical maneuvers by various colonial powers around
Taiwan, it is equally I remarkable that the authors do not deploy
historical knowledge to challenge the ; politics of knowledge and the
political construction of sovereignty. What is it, 1 then, that drives
the authors, from the very outset, to s\~\~bsume the political nature :
of the historical problem surrounding Taiwan to a court of international
reason? If f there is, as Taiwanese independence-oriented thinkers like
Peng Ming-min be1 ieve, I ; a lesson to be drawn from Taiwan\'s history,
[it is clear that no sovereignty takes Taiwan itself as a central, core
region of power. Rather, off-island-centered sovereignties lay claim to
Taiwan]{.underline}, for various different reasons and histories, but
always [as part of a strategic gambit which itself forms the de facto
framework of sovereignty during an age]{.underline} (\'modernity\') [of
intense international competition compressed by capital-imperialist
global expansion.]{.underline} The standard position of Taiwanese
independence would thus find the resolution to a painful history of
external subjugation in the assertion of sovereignty whose core is
located in territorial Taiwan. Although vociferous opponents of
Taiwanese independence disagree, the appeal to territorial sovereignty
as a final resolution of Taiwanese history is equally shared. Change in
the construction of sovereignty is one of the most common themes
articulated by contemporary defenders of \'Taiwan,\' who unimaginatively
assert that the kind of ethno-territorial sovereignty claimed by the
Chinese government is anachronistic. Needless to say, the enunciation of
this position requires a certain disavowal of history. Anyone familiar
with the 19\'\" century history of the European Japanese Imperialist
penetration of the Qing Empire will immediately recognize a familiar
motif in which impetuous Chinese sovereignty is always already
anachronistic compared to the progressive, rationally-legislated
sovereignty (in fact, the only real sovereignty) of the Powers (Europe
and Japan). While subsequent generations of Chinese undertake enormous
sacrifices to respond, sovereignty today is being restructured into a
new kind of subjective technology, what Hardt and Negri call immaterial
labor. And, as is true of material labor, outdated means of production
incur greater moral opprobrium. Our analysis of the hidden continuities
between the TRA and Martial Law might suggest that settling the question
of Taiwanese sovereignty would end the enduring violence that affects
Taiwanese society due to the permanent state of exception into which
Taiwan, from Martial Law to the TRA, has been thrown. Certainly this
analysis cannot be refuted, and at this level, we must agree that
maintenance of the status quo in China-Taiwan relations is the biggest
obstacle to democratic development in Taiwan. However, **[we must
question whether even the regularization of Taiwan\'s sovereignty would
remove Taiwan from its long sojourn in the state of permanent
exception]{.underline}** since Martial Law. Certainly posing this
question means that **[the issue of Taiwanese sovereignty would have to
be linked to the crisis of sovereignty around the world]{.underline}**,
including particularly the problematic status of sovereign power in
China, [and the emergence of biopolitics.]{.underline} Although
resolution of Taiwanese sovereignty (for instance, as independent nation
or as province of China) would grant some relative stability vis-a-vis
the current situation, it would not resolve the predicament into which
sovereignty has fallen since the 20Ih century. [After all the remnants
of sovereignty\'s surplus of normativity have been washed away, the one
unassailable narrative about modern Taiwanese history that remains would
be the suffering that the enduring crisis of sovereignty has imposed for
several centuries upon Taiwanese peoples (including, notably, decimated
aboriginal populations completely denied the possibility for national
aspiration). **True Taiwanese independence would only come when
Taiwanese peoples**, in tandem with (other) Chinese peoples, **have
finally been liberated from this history and this imperative. Taiwanese
independence thus awaits the invention of an Asia that is not simply the
\'other\' of the West, nor the mirror image of the West\'s own worst
fantasies of autonomous national subjectivity - typified by the
nationalist appropriation of sovereignty.**]{.underline} This invention,
it may be worth clarifying, does not supercede, or substitute for, or
follow in progressive fashion after, etc \.... the construction of
national sovereignty by non-Westerners, such as Taiwanese, who have been
barbarized by the crisis of sovereignty for many centuries. However,
[the fact that Taiwanese are denied accession to the lethal normativity
of sovereignty, yet remain subject to its imperatives and actively
promote its consolidation, is a situation that must not be allowed to
continue to be given]{.underline} (by Chinese, Taiwanese, Americans,
Japanese, etc \....) [as a pretext for ignoring the equally real, global
crisis of sovereignty around Taiwan - a crisis which no construction of
normative, national sovereignty can resolve.]{.underline} Without a
doubt, the greatest change since the end of the Cold War in the status
of sovereignty is the emergence of human rights and humanitarian
intervention as a non-political arena. The best vision writers like Peng
and Huang can provide is an appeal to international human rights, with
which the authors end their argument for Taiwanese independence. We know
that at the back and **[at the core of Taiwan\'s status is a question
about the relation between human rights and sovereignty.]{.underline}**
We can follow a persuasive line of argument developed by Arendt,
Balibar, and Agamben25 that shows how [the concept of **human rights is
integrally part of the logic of sovereignty, and** hence **cannot be
simply relied upon to counter or mitigate its effects.**]{.underline}
Agamben perceptively observes: \'It is almost as if, starting from a
certain point, every decisive political event were double-sided: the
spaces, the liberties, and [the rights won by individuals in their
conflicts with central powers always simultaneously prepared a tacit but
increasing inscription of individuals\' lives within the state order,
thus offering a new and more dreadful foundation for the very sovereign
power from which they wanted to liberate
themselves]{.underline}.\'\~\~Once again, a glance at [the Taiwan
Relations Act]{.underline} is quite illuminating. As that document
[makes]{.underline} clear, [human rights]{.underline} in Taiwan is
ultimately [indistinguishable from the rhetoric of military
intervention.]{.underline}17 After reading Agamben, we are neither
surprised that the seminal work of Taiwanese independence seamlessly
articulates human rights to a discourse of national sovereignty, nor can
we uncritically accept the equation of the two. [**Our task is to go
beyond these 18th century formulations** (which 20th century history
pushed towards unprecedented levels of biopolitical violence) **and find
new ways to theorize biopolitics and the
community-to-come**.]{.underline} Undoubtedly, the difficulty of this
future invention is compounded by the realization that going beyond
sovereignty also necessarily means going beyond its others. Inevitably,
this will bring a challenge to the construction of \'civil society\' and
its globalized variants. Liberal thought has always posited civil
society as the legitimate bearer of resistance to the excesses of
sovereign power. Our perspective exemplifies, however, the inadequacy of
this formulation in the face of unprecedented change. In the current
conjuncture, [the true bearer of sovereignty lies more and more with the
category of \'life,\' stripped down to bare, unqualified existence. This
denuded life is now becoming almost exclusively construed through an
ethico-techno-logical discourse oi rights, which are constantly being
expanded or upgraded; and total possession, which is constantly being
honed down to new, intrusive definitions of the personal
body.]{.underline}28 Hence it behooves us to consider the body in
relation to sovereign power, and to prepare the way for an understanding
of a body that is consonant with non-sovereign politics. In the course
of this essay, we have concentrated on two main figures in the theater
of operations opened by sovereign power: the sovereign police and the
outsider (the excluded; but also, possibly, the non-sovereign community
of the multitudes). By way of conclusion, we would like to introduce a
third figure that instantly follows from these two, and indeed has been
implicit throughout our narrative: the knowledgeable body. It is well
known that knowledge in the Human Sciences has been deeply intertwined
with national sovereignty and language in the modern period. [**What we
are beginning to see by looking at the crisis of sovereignty in Taiwan
is the way in which sovereignty in general operates** as a totalizing
discourse across differences of nationality and language. The
normativity of sovereignty is not only the default position for all
accounts]{.underline}- regardless of language, ethnicity, and political
position -of Taiwanese history, [it is the only position. The utter
uniformity with which all writers concerned with Taiwan - if not the
entire Pacific Theater - simply accept **the normative framework of
international relations** and the urgency to think the humanitarian,
which is intrinsically connected to the discursive apparatus of military
investment and intervention, is itself an indication of the need to
rethink the position of the knowing subject and the social institutions
that enable public knowledge.]{.underline} At the very least, we need to
begin to understand the eerie convergence between ostensibly ethnicized
bodies and producers of knowledge about them. For an understanding of
the knowledgeable bodies that operate in the theater of operations open
to the sovereign police, nothing is more apposite than what Naoki Sakai
terms the \'subjective technology of translation\' - a term which refers
to the creation of national language and national culture through a
process of co-figuration. National language, hence national identity, is
mutually produced in relation to the putative unity of an external
\'other\' in a process that includes the non-natibnal only by exclusion.
[This exclusion is not evidence of a limit or impossibility so much as
it **is an indication of just how persuasive and widespread the
juridico-ethical Empire of sovereign technology has
become**.]{.underline} This perspective does not call for us simply to
abandon sovereignty (ostensibly in favor of \'difference\') in either
our politics or in our conceptual understanding. Rather, [it calls for
us to engage the totalizing claims of sovereignty]{.underline} (and
beyond that, of capital) [with thought and praxis capable of producing
new categories]{.underline} (e.g. an \'open totality,\' ideas of
non-relational equivalency that go beyond Same and Other, and/or
proposals for a non-sovereign politics) [that articulate the problems of
biopolitics and globalization.]{.underline}

#### Westphalian models of sovereignty frame discussions of Taiwanese independence, ensuring continued otherization and conflict. A systematic rethinking of the conceptual framework of sovereign power is necessary to move forward.

**Pan 2010** \[Chengxin, Associate Professor of International Relations
in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Deakin University,
\"Westphalia and the Taiwan Conundrum: A Case Against the Exclusionist
Construction of Sovereignty and Identity,\" *Journal of Chinese
Political Science*, 15.4GDI-ATN\]

Westphalian Sovereignty, Zero-sum Games, and the Taiwan Conflict If the
Chinese mainland and Taiwan share [the common normative ground of
Westphalian sovereignty]{.underline}, the ensuing question is: How does
this normative convergence [contribute to the intractability of the
Taiwan issue]{.underline}? Conventional wisdom has it that conflict
arises from difference, while cooperation rests on convergence, as
"democratic peace" theory would have us believe. But this is true only
to a certain point. Very often, commonality as well as difference is at
the core of social conflict. For instance, a fundamental aspect of the
conflict between Christianity and Islam could be traced back to their
commonly-held monotheism as well as their myriad differences. Indeed, it
is not despite, but because of, their shared belief in the existence of
only one God that their clash has been so irreconcilable. Similarly, it
may be argued that many European conflicts in the colonial era were
animated as much by their shared belief in social Darwinism as by their
differing colonial interests. Thus Otto Klineberg observes that "the
opinions and attitudes of two contending sides may be mirror images of
each other" (\[54\], 94). Ashis Nandy \[55\] calls this phenomenon "the
intimate enemy," whereas Raymond Aron refers to it as "the enemy
partners."5 This may sound odd, but that is because, as Charles Taylor
points out, people have conflated common meaning with consensus. While
the latter is conducive to cooperation, the former is not necessarily
the case. As Taylor (\[56\], 39) explains: We could\... say that common
meanings are quite other than consensus, for they can subsist with a
high degree of cleavage; this is what happens when a common meaning
comes to be lived and understood differently by different groups in a
society. It remains a common meaning, because there is the reference
point which is the common purpose, aspiration, celebration\.... But this
common meaning is differently articulated by different groups. This is
the basis of the bitterest fights in a society\.... Perhaps one might
say that a common meaning is very often the cause of the most bitter
lack of consensus. In cross-strait relations, Westphalian sovereignty is
precisely such a "common meaning," which can similarly explain the very
lack of consensus between Beijing and Taipei. It is in this sense that I
argue that the link between Westphalian sovereignty and conflict needs
to be more fully understood. As many scholars have noted, sovereign
states and war often go hand in hand. For Charles Tilly, "war made the
state and the state made war" (\[30\], 42). In a similar vein, Michael
Howard argues that "no Nation, in the true sense of the word, could be
born without war" (\[57\], 102, emphasis in original). By "the true
sense of the word," there is little doubt that Howard means the
Westphalian sovereign state. The irony here is that while [the
Westphalian state is defined by its ability to monopolize the legitimate
use of violence, the process in which to acquire that monopoly is
frequently fraught with violence]{.underline} (\[58\], 59). Admittedly,
the Westphalian model of sovereignty is not meant to incite war or
violence. Quite the opposite, Bodin's idea of sovereignty was designed
to find a cure to the scourge of religious conflict that had ravaged
France at the time. For Thomas Hobbes, the main political purpose of the
sovereign state (the Leviathan) was to maintain internal order.
Similarly, through a clear demarcation of sovereignty on the basis of
territory and the reciprocal recognition of sovereignty, the Treaty of
Westphalia was aimed primarily to settle Europe's prolonged religious
disputes. That said, [while Westphalia helps regulate violence by
restricting the monopoly of violence and war-making to territorial
states only, it does not quite succeed in stopping war or violence per
se]{.underline}. As Susan Strange observed, internally it "did nothing
to stop conflicts over the major sources of revenue and wealth for the
state" (\[59\], 347). Indeed, in his study of the relationship between
identity and violence in Bosnia, David Campbell goes so far as to argue
[that the conventional understanding of sovereignty and territorial
identity was largely responsible for both ethnic cleansing and slow
international intervention in the Balkans]{.underline} \[60\]. **[Even
as the sovereign state manages to establish order domestically, it can
be argued that human violence is merely displaced "from within the
territory of the state into the realm of interstate
relations"]{.underline}** (\[61\], 440). The reason why Westphalian
sovereignty is intimately linked to conflict is straightforward. To
begin with, [Westphalian sovereignty, understood as final authority,
does not allow for compromise where sovereignty is believed to be at
stake. A struggle for final authority is by definition a mutually
exclusive, zero-sum game.]{.underline} Hobbes observes that "If any two
men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy,
they become enemies" (\[62\], 184). Thanks to the diffusion of the
Westphalian norm, sovereign authority is precisely such a commonly
desired thing and cannot be jointly enjoyed. As such, its [exclusive
ownership often needs to be settled by "the victory of one side over the
other, a victory that makes the one sovereign and the other
subject]{.underline}" (\[1\], 98). In international relations, there are
numerous examples of this type of zero-sum struggle for sovereignty.
Take the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians for instance, the
indivisible characteristic of sovereignty was likened by a former Tel
Aviv lawyer to a "woman," who cannot be shared (\[63\], 66). This
analogy, while rather crude, does strike at the heart of the
Israeli-Palestinian problem, a problem which, according to Anthony
Burke, has much to do with "the conceptual foundations Israel shares
with other states---with the modern \[Westphalian\] ontology of the
secure nation-state" (\[63\], 70--1). Such a zero-sum struggle for
exclusive sovereignty is also manifested in the contentious and
potentially explosive Taiwan issue. [During much of the Cold War period,
the two sides]{.underline}, informed by the Westphalian idea of
exclusive sovereign authority, [pretended that the other did not even
exist as a political entity, let alone as an equal.]{.underline} The KMT
government in Taiwan viewed the People's Republic as a bunch of
"Communist bandits" (gongfei) and pursued a policy of "three no's"
vis-à-vis the mainland: [no official contacts, no negotiations, and no
compromise]{.underline}. Likewise, Beijing regarded Taiwan as little
more than a "renegade province." In the fight over the seat in the
United Nations in the early 1970s, mainland China insisted that it would
not join unless Taipei was expelled (Taipei buchu, Beijing buru). The
Taiwan authorities, after losing the UN votes, decided to withdraw from
the UN rather than accepting a proposal of dual representation, on the
ground that "There is no room for patriots and traitors to live
together" (Han zei bu liangli) (\[81\], 108). With final authority
believed to be at stake, **[compromise has]{.underline}** thus [been
routinely ruled out by both sides as a sign of weakness or even
surrender]{.underline}. In a 1997 interview with Asian Affairs, then
Chinese President Jiang Zemin made this point clear: "You have here a
case where the fundamental interests of a nation lie. On such a question
involving state sovereignty, a government has no room for any
compromise" \[64\]. Echoing this stance, a group of scholars at an
influential think tank in Beijing argued that "we are not willing to see
the loss of the principle of single sovereignty---the inseparability of
sovereignty.... If any compromises are made with regard to Taiwan, they
will not be made over the question of sovereignty and the one China
principle, which is the key to the problem" (\[38\], 134). Likewise, in
reference to Beijing's "one country, two systems" proposal, the Taiwan
authorities made an uncompromising, mirror-image response: "the purpose
of 'one country, two systems' is to demand the ROC's complete surrender
to the Chinese Communists.... Therefore, this piece of proposal from the
Chinese Communists is in fact impractical in the objective sense, and
absolutely unacceptable to us in the subjective sense" \[65\]. Thus,
[this]{.underline} unwillingness to make compromise, which in large
degree accounts for the Taiwan impasse, [is clearly derived from the
Westphalian notion of exclusionary sovereignty.]{.underline} Second,
also complicating this zero-sum standoff is the aforementioned
Westphalian nexus between sovereignty and territory. If the struggle
over sovereignty already precludes compromise, then the [Westphalian
territorialization of sovereignty makes such a struggle even more
diametrically Manichaean: either a state possesses sovereignty over a
particular piece of territory, or it doesn't]{.underline} (\[61\], 439).
Just as there is no room for compromise over final authority, so there
is no space for territorial ambiguity; **[sovereignty, in the
Westphalian sense of the word, has to be clearly demarcated along a
geographical boundary that separates "self" from "Other."]{.underline}**
This helps us understand not only why territorial integrity has been at
the core of the "one China" principle, but also why, despite
ever-increasing economic links, solutions to many territorial disputes
in Asia still remain elusive (\[16\], 121). Third, given that the
Westphalian ideal entails the convergence between the state and the
nation, **[not only is the struggle over sovereignty concerned with
territory, but it is also about national identity]{.underline}**. As
noted before, a central part of the modern narrative of state
sovereignty has been about popular sovereignty, in which final authority
is allegedly invested with the nation. To the extent that Westphalian
sovereignty implies that the nation's identity and survival hinges on
territorial sovereignty, a struggle for the latter then becomes a matter
of life and death for the former. As the argument goes, if "A stateless
person in the statecentric world is a nonperson" (\[66\], 245). then [a
stateless nation in the Westphalian state system would be no nation at
all.]{.underline} To compromise on sovereignty and territorial integrity
thus amounts to nothing short of treason or national suicide. In this
sense, it is not difficult to understand why the struggle for the olive
trees on the banks of the river Jordan, emblematic of a fight over
people's sense of home and identity, has been so venomous (\[67\], 27).
Equally, it is also easy to understand why the territorial status of
Taiwan has taken on such monumental significance for both sides. An
influential book on Taiwan independence, The Four-Hundred-Year History
of the Taiwanese by Shih Ming, argues that unless the Taiwanese
establish their own country, the future of the nation will remain
wretched and uncertain (\[68\], 150). Without doubt, such a [direct
appeal to national identity and survival has contributed a great deal to
the further hardening of the resolve of many Taiwanese for national
self-determination]{.underline}. Indeed, it was precisely on the basis
of the democratic right to national self-determination that the Taiwan
authorities under Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian were able to
strenuously refuse to negotiate with Beijing on the prospects of
reunification. If the survival of a Taiwanese identity is deployed to
justify Taiwan's de facto, if not de jure, independence, [the dignity of
the Chinese nation has been similarly invoked to legitimate the cause of
China's reunification]{.underline}. As Zhu De, a founder of the People's
Liberation Army, once claimed, "As long as Taiwan is not liberated, the
Chinese people's historical humiliation is not washed away" (quoted in
\[69\], 79). The problem with [this common invocation of "popular
sovereignty" and national humiliation]{.underline} is not only that the
nation in question is often imagined and constructed and thus subject to
contestation, but also that its construction [hinges on a
territory-identity nexus which is from the outset "a dangerous
idealism"]{.underline} (\[60\], 116). Within this idealism, "\[c\]laims
to self-determination are therefore unlikely to be seen as negotiable by
either side, effectively increasing the stakes of the conflict and
decreasing the chances of a negotiated resolution" (\[70\], 27). When
Chen Shui-bian claimed that "Only Taiwan's 23 million people have the
right to decide Taiwan's future" \[71\], scholars on mainland China
countered that "even if a referendum \[concerning Taiwan's status\] is
to be held, it should be decided by all people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, not just by local residents in Taiwan" (\[20\], 35). In
this way, [not only is the appeal to popular sovereignty unable to
resolve the Taiwan dispute, but it could well lead to its further
escalation. **What makes this contest between different versions of
popular sovereignty particularly dangerous is that the invocation of
national identity is almost inevitably predicated on the construction of
self and Other, with each seen as the negation of the
other**]{.underline}. [Once this dichotomy is conjured up, any means to
eliminate the "Other" could then be safely justified.]{.underline} To
the extent that both sides treat each other in this way, it is not
difficult to imagine the dire consequences. Although Chinese leaders
have stated that Chinese do not fight Chinese, they have not hesitated
to label those who agitate for Taiwan's independence the nation's enemy,
to be stopped by military force if necessary. And to make such a threat
credible as well as legitimate, China has deployed hundreds of
short-range missiles in its Fujian province opposite Taiwan, and
enshrined its right to use "non-peaceful means" in the 2005 Anti-
Secession Law. This tough stance in turn has more often than not
backfired, resulting in a further hardening of attitudes in Taiwan.
Hence a vicious cycle of mutual distrust and hostility. In short,
**[integral to international conflict in general and the Taiwan issue in
particular is a particular modern ontological vision of world politics
that is Westphalian sovereignty]{.underline}**. This is not to suggest
that every international conflict is a result of this normative
convergence or that any two entities who share the idea of Westphalian
sovereignty will necessarily clash. In any case, the role of ideas
should not be exaggerated to the point of determinism. Bearing this in
mind, I wish to qualify that the linkage between Westphalian normative
convergence and conflict is valid only if the two actors' self-claimed
sovereign boundaries overlap, and either or both sides regard their
overlapped territory as vital to their national interest. For instance,
if two countries, both subscribing to the notion of Westphalian
sovereignty, do not have overlapping sovereignty claims, their normative
convergence in this regard need not lead them to conflict. Indeed, it
may even create sympathy between them when one's sovereignty is
infringed upon by a third party, as in the case of China's tacit support
for Yugoslavia during the NATO-led intervention over Kosovo in 1999. At
the same time, the frictions between China and the American-led NATO
alliance were caused by their normative divergence over sovereignty and
human rights. Furthermore, even if two countries' sovereignty claims do
overlap, while this may create bilateral tensions, such tensions could
remain manageable so long as the perceived cost of such a conflict is
seen by both sides as outweighing the benefit, or if the interest
involved in the dispute is outweighed by broader interest derived from
cooperation on other issues of mutual concern. The Sino-Russian border
dispute is a case in point here. In the Taiwan context, however, while
many recognize the high cost associated with a cross-strait conflict,
the fact that both sides regard Taiwan as vital to their identity and
political survival means that **[so long as they both insist on a
Westphalian model of sovereignty, this standoff is unlikely to have an
effective solution in sight.]{.underline}** Thus, in order to better
comprehend the root cause of the Taiwan conundrum and identify a
solution, it is necessary to highlight the issue of normative
convergence of Westphalian sovereignty across the Taiwan Strait.
Certainly, this critique of Westphalian sovereignty does not mean that
it is the only factor that plagues the Taiwan issue. Difference does
pose a formidable challenge to cross-strait reconciliation, and bridging
difference as well as promoting integration is important. And yet,
difference per se does not necessarily lead to conflict. As exemplified
in sports, while competition cannot take place without different teams
or players, it must at the same time be enabled by commonly agreed
rules. In a similar vein, ethnic difference has long been a reality in
the Balkans, and that reality did not prevent people from living
together peacefully for generations. In the words of one Muslim lady in
Bosnia, "I am a Muslim, but I didn't know that before the \[Bosnia\]
war. Before the war, of course, we were all atheists!" (\[60\], 1,
88--99). What in part sparked the Bosnia war and the violent ethnic
cleansing associated with it, therefore, was not the fact of ethnic
difference per se, but an ethnicity-based, exclusivist idea of national
identity which began to capture the popular imagination in the formerly
Communist state following the end of the Cold War. What this example
illustrates is that many 'differences' in international relations are
enabled by a common ideational ground, rather than something simply out
there.6 The same can be said of the many differences across the Taiwan
Strait. At the same time, this article does not suggest that with the
internalization of this ideal on both sides of Taiwan Strait, there
would be no hope for even some sort of modus vivendi. To the contrary,
since Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008, there has been a welcome
rapprochement between Beijing and Taipei. This indeed is not the first
time the two sides have managed to set aside their differences and
engaged in dialogue. From 1992 to 1995, for instance, the two sides held
several rounds of constructive talks through their semi-official
channels and signed agreements on the notarization of documents and mail
registration. But those cross-strait rapprochements were made possible,
I argue, not in spite of the existence of normative convergence on
Westphalian sovereignty, but because of its temporary suspension. Take
the 1992--1995 period for example, the aforementioned moderate progress
was largely a result of the pragmatism that is reflected in the 1992
"one China, different interpretations" consensus. In other words, it was
a temporary shelving of the Westphalian struggle for sovereignty that
helped to break the deadlock. The latest rapprochement has followed a
similar path, with Beijing advocating that cross-strait talks should
"deal with easy issues before the difficult ones and put economy before
politics" \[72\]. But this compromise is possible only insofar as it is
seen as not directly affecting their core concerns about sovereignty and
territorial integrity (as in the case of direct cross-strait weekend
charter flights and the opening of mainland tourists to Taiwan).
Although the current pragmatic approaches adopted by Beijing and Taipei
are an important first step, they are nonetheless inadequate so long as
**[a systematic rethinking of their shared conceptual framework of
Westphalian sovereignty continues to be absent]{.underline}**. In this
sense, **[cross-strait rapprochement testifies to the very need to move
beyond Westphalian sovereignty if cross-strait relations are to continue
moving forward. Without a breakthrough in the way both Beijing and
Taipei imagine sovereignty, territory, and identity, it is doubtful
whether the current rapprochement would lead to an eventual solution to
the Taiwan conundrum.]{.underline}**

#### Critiquing the exceptionalism of security discourse is key to good policy scholarship -- we must refuse the disqualification of alternative knowledge claims about security

**Aradau & Van Munster 2009** \[Claudia, Prof of International Politics
and Co-chair of the Research Centre in IR, Rens, Senior researcher and
coordinator for the Peace, Risk and Violence research unit,
"Exceptionalism and the 'War on Terror': Criminology Meets International
Relations," British Journal of Criminology 49.5, p.689-92, GDI-GMW\]

Exceptionalism has been widely debated in IR, while criminology has so
far largely turned to other concepts---such as state crime, moral panic
or risk---to explore the 'war on terror'. Although the criminological
literature has provided many useful insights into the practices and
actions deployed by states, politicians, the media and other actors,
this article has argued that **[engaging with debates about theories of
the exception and exceptionalism in IR could lead to a fruitful
dialogue]{.underline}** between the two disciplines. Introducing an
argument about how the 'war on terror' is simultaneously transgressing
and underwriting the law, this article has unpacked the state of
exception as a useful tool for apprehending the constitution of domestic
and global power relations. Guantánamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, extraordinary
rendition, surveillance and other practices deployed in the 'war on
terror' can all be defined as sites of exception and arbitrary
decisionism that simultaneously function as the violent condition for
the existence of sovereignty, law and politically qualified life.
Exposing the exception as the founding crime of law, we have shown in
which ways the 'war on terror' defines the limits of the state and the
system of states. **[Reading the 'war on terror' through the lens of
exceptionalism shows that the international cannot be separated from the
national in as far as domestic expressions of the enemy often rely upon
international representations of modernity and progress that separate
the West from the rest of the world---and vice versa.]{.underline}** If
the domestic and the international have been thought of as two domains,
each requiring its own discipline, the state of exception points at
their mutual dependency to the point that one could speak of inside and
outside as a 'Möbius ribbon' (Bigo 2001). [Only when the whole array of
practices, discourses and institutions deployed in the 'war on terror'
is taken into consideration, domestically as well as internationally, is
it possible to get a clear sense of what kind of limits and enemies are
fostered to legitimize and institutionalize domestic authoritarianism
and the international division of forms of life.]{.underline} Moreover,
whereas IR has viewed processes of enemy construction as exceptional
acts related to discourses on national security, the 'war on terror'
shows that the exception has trickled down to the more mundane
technologies and strategies analysed by criminology scholars. In
particular, precautionary measures at the horizon of a catastrophic
future translate radical uncertainty and future catastrophe into an
exceptional politics of fear that integrates the everyday, mundane
practices of policing with the exceptional practices of war. Finally,
**[understanding the ways in which exceptionalism operates will also
help critical scholarship in both IR and criminology to further discuss
the deteriorating effects of the 'war on terror' on political
communities and social transformation.]{.underline}** It is not
sufficient to claim that states exaggerate and blow up threats in order
to call for measures that are more in tune with their 'real' magnitude.
For one thing, this form of critique can generally only be made after
the fact (e.g. only when we know that Iraq did not possess weapons of
mass destruction, we can say anything about the actual presence of the
threats). More important, however, is [the insight that alternative
knowledge claims will often fall on deaf ears when security policy is
informed by the twin limit of scientific uncertainty and future
catastrophic damage.]{.underline} In these cases, **[it is also
imperative to point out the constitutive power of the exception, the
fear it provokes, the enemies it creates and the profound effects it has
on the ways we live as a community, domestically as well as
globally.]{.underline}**

### Leads to War

#### Reconceptualizing normative models of sovereignty are key to a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan crisis. Anything else will result in violent military confrontation

**Pan 2010** \[Chengxin, Associate Professor of International Relations
in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Deakin University,
\"Westphalia and the Taiwan Conundrum: A Case Against the Exclusionist
Construction of Sovereignty and Identity,\" *Journal of Chinese
Political Science*, 15.4GDI-ATN\]

The 1648 Peace of [Westphalia]{.underline} is often hailed as a
watershed in the evolution of international society. Its principle of
territorially-based sovereignty [is regarded as a fundamental reality in
international relations, and becomes such a powerful ideal that
states]{.underline}---large or small, rich or poor, East or West---[seem
to have taken it for granted.]{.underline} "Established" nation-states
jealously guard their sovereignty, whereas "stateless nations" aspire to
achieve their sovereign status on the promise of national
selfdetermination. It is in this context that both Beijing and Taipei,
for all their differences, find themselves on a common ideational
ground. But as I have argued in this article, [this normative
convergence, instead of serving as a bridge, has been a major source of
cross-strait division. With Westphalian sovereignty's emphasis on
clear-cut boundary and exclusive final authority, one side's insistence
on territorial integrity means that the other side must give up its
claim to self-determination]{.underline}, and vice versa. Clearly,
**[this is a recipe for deadlock and confrontation. Acting on this
normative ideal, not only would Beijing and Taipei likely slide into a
dangerous military conflict that neither side wants, but such a conflict
could be the most likely scenario that sparks a direct military
confrontation between China and the United States.]{.underline}** There
is little doubt that no amount of sovereignty gain by either side could
outweigh the cost of such a clash of titans. To the extent that the
Taiwan conundrum is derived in part from this cross-strait normative
convergence, [there is a need for the establishment of an alternative
common ground that is less totalitarian, less mutually exclusive, more
positive-sum, and more accommodating than what Westphalian sovereignty
has to offer.]{.underline} For reasons of space it is not possible for
this article to elaborate on what such alternative models of
conceptualizing sovereignty might entail in the Taiwan context.7 But it
is safe to say that [alternatives to the Westphalian model of
sovereignty in the Taiwan Strait are becoming increasingly
possible.]{.underline} In light of growing interdependence and
ever-deepening economic and cultural ties, [it is no longer realistic
(if it ever was) to pursue the Westphalian unity of final authority,
territory, and the nation-state in the conventional sense.]{.underline}
As many scholars have already pointed out, despite the uncompromising
nature of state sovereignty in theory, in practice it has been
frequently compromised. The pooling of sovereignty in the European Union
is one notable example, and China's "one country, two systems" in Hong
Kong is another. Neither China nor Taiwan may care to acknowledge it,
but as James McCall Smith has illustrated, China's numerous commitments
to Hong Kong's autonomy enshrined in the Joint Declaration and Basic Law
have already constituted a "partial violation of the Westphalian concept
of the exclusion of external authority" (\[73\], 107--8). Thus, Chris
Brown (\[27\], 36) suggests that "The idea that sovereignty constitutes
a norm of the Westphalia System can only be taken seriously if the
actual practice of the system is ignored." Krasner \[13\] goes so far as
to refer to the frequent compromise of sovereignty as "organized
hypocrisy." The existence of various ways of compromising sovereignty is
an important reminder that **[for all its perceived ontological
givenness in global life, sovereignty is a particular social
construct]{.underline}** \[74\]. Its sacrosanct status in the eyes of
nations notwithstanding, [it has always been a means in response to
socially and historically specific needs and challenges, rather than a
timeless end in itself.]{.underline} For this reason, despite, or
perhaps because of, the ideational source of the China-Taiwan problem,
the problem is not inherently intractable. As in the case of the
seemingly endless Cold War, "if the United States and Soviet Union
decide that they are no longer enemies, 'the cold war is over.' [It is
collective meanings that constitute the structures which organize our
actions"]{.underline} (\[75\], 397). Similarly, [if the socially
constructed meaning of Westphalian sovereignty has outlived its useful
purposes in places like the Taiwan Strait, it can, as it should, be
reconstructed.]{.underline} One should of course be under no illusion
that such a reconstruction will be easy; ideas, norms and institutions,
once constructed, often take on a life of their own. And yet, this
difficulty is no excuse not to find a peaceful and more lasting solution
to the Taiwan question, given that, as mentioned at the beginning of the
article, a war in the Taiwan Strait would be catastrophic.

### AT: Independence Coming

#### Teleological faith in democratization of Taiwan is a product of American mythmaking -- it masks the way that independence rhetoric has further inscribed Taiwan within the biopolitical state of exception

**Solomon 2004** \[Jon, Assistant Prof in the Department of Futures
Studies at Tamkang University, Post-doctoral research fellow in the
Society for the Humanities at Cornell University, "Taiwan Incorporated:
A Survey of Biopolitics in the Sovereign Police's Pacific Theater of
Operations," *Traces* 3, p.239-240, GDI-JCR\]

With the end of martial law in 1987, and the first election by popular
suffrage of Taiwan\'s head-of-state in 1996, the discourse of
sovereignty has apparently begun to erase the legacy of this painful
history. [The relation between the new]{.underline}, ostensibly
[democratic form of popular sovereignty, behind which]{.underline} often
[lurks the interests of]{.underline} local [capital]{.underline} allied
to global production, [and the previous forms of sovereign
power]{.underline} under martial law [is invariably subsumed by a vague,
progressive teleology which posits the neo-liberal state - **a kind of
fictive representation** metonymically equivalent to the media
presentation of the United States - as the ultimate direction of
democratic development. **This teleological faith prevents us from
analyzing the ways in which democratic reform has actually
served**]{.underline}, not simply as a pretext for salacious private
interest (which could be remedied by a return to public reason and a
strengthening of the institutions that codify reason), but [**as an
ideological interpellation of new subject positions that blend the
biopolitics of sovereign power** established during martial law to new
forces of production and \' immaterial labor **in the current
conjuncture of unprecedented globalization.**]{.underline} Although
democratization has reinstated the formal exercise of citizenship, [the
essential ingredients that formerly reduced citizenship to population
remain in place]{.underline}: the sexual division of labor and juridical
codes that favor patriarchal prerogative continue, language politics
remain in a state of exception, and the system of citizenship laws and
aboriginal population control remains fully in effect. Ethnicity, no
longer marked on identification cards (except for aborigines),
nevertheless remains on file in government archives. In the meantime,
democratization has not fundamentally improved the former identification
of the Party-State with Capital. As Wang (1 996) shows, [democratic
reform has changed the composition of the Party-State to reflect the
movement of capital from State to private interests.]{.underline} In
other words, the former Party-State has merely renegotiated a new
alliance with Capital (or perhaps we should say that Capital has
negotiated a new alliance redefining the Party-State), based not upon a
minority exile population with a monopoly on Statc power, but upon an
ethnically-mixed minority population of local private interests who
appropriate the State apparatus for Private-Party ends.I5This
anti-democratic movement, which we can call the \'Private-Party
State,\'arose together with a parallel movement that increased Taiwan\'s
incorporation into the global economy. Indeed, at several key junctures
in the democratic reform, the United States exerted critical economic
pressure upon Taiwan\'s monetary policy by calling for the
\'internationalization of the New Taiwan Dollar,\' creating pressure
that seriously affected the development of domestic political
reform.\'\"Our thesis is that the powers of private interest and global
hegemony that informed - even commanded - the [**democratic
reforms**]{.underline} since the end of martial law continue to
**[maintain an effective link with the status of permanent exception
previously instituted by martial law, maintaining sovereign power in a
radically altered field of population, governmentality and
biopolitics.]{.underline}** The difficulties encountered by President
Chen Shui-bien, the first non-KMT head-of-state, elected almost by
accident in 2000, could well serve as evidence of the profound
resistance of the Private Party-State to democratization, and the
continuing collapse of the political into economic categories.
**[Equally important]{.underline}**, and certainly even less well
understood, however, **[remains the problem of Taiwan\'s incorporation
within the U.S.-led global Empire.]{.underline}**

## Biopower

### Impact

#### Securitization grounds the biopolitical state of exception that reduces being to bare life, enabling extra-juridical violence against the threatening other. Concentration camps and genocide are the inevitable result of this devaluation of life.

**Burke 2007** \[Anthony, Senior Lecturer in Politics and IR at
University of New South Wales, Beyond Security: Ethics, and Violence,

Like Hobbes before him, Schmitt conceived [a figure of the enemy -- a
threatening Other --]{.underline} that [is constitutive of the
state]{.underline} as 'the specific entity of a people'.8 Without it
society is not political and a people cannot be said to exist: Only the
actual participants can correctly recognise, understand and judge the
concrete situation and settle the extreme case of conflict . . . to
judge whether the adversary intends to negate his opponent's way of life
and therefore must be repulsed or fought in order to preserve one's own
form of existence.9 (emphasis added) It is clear that [such a conception
of the political has a tendency to surround the entirety of political
life with an aura of emergency and threat to one's very existence.
Problems such as terrorism, flows of asylum seekers or weapons of mass
destruction, are thus easily magnified into ones that must be viewed
through the prisms]{.underline} of identity, [existential antagonism and
combat.]{.underline} While Schmitt claimed to be opposed to militarism
(like many realists he advocated the avoidance of war) he stated that
the political was only existent 'when a fighting collectivity of people
confronts a similar collectivity'. Hence the potential for war was an
existential condition: [the entire life of a human being is a struggle
and every human being is symbolically a combatant.]{.underline} The
friend, enemy and combat concepts receive their real meaning precisely
because they refer to the real possibility of physical killing. War
follows from enmity. War is the existential negation of the enemy.10 In
his 2004 State of the Union speech, Bush went out of his way to defend
his administration's conceptualisation of the response to terrorism as
'war' and the use of extraordinary legal powers and unilateral military
force to meet the threat: 'after the chaos and carnage of September the
11th', he argued, 'it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal
papers. The terrorists and their supporters declared war on the United
States, and war is what they got.'11 He also lectured Congress on the
need to renew the Patriot Act, 'key provisions \[of which\] are set to
expire next year. The terrorist threat will not expire on that
schedule'.12 Yet many provisions of that Act and other administrative
measures were deeply controversial, especially the Executive Order that
authorised the 'indefinite detention' and trial by 'military
commissions' of the 'battlefield detainees' held in camps at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba. As if sprung whole from Schmitt's theory, the Order stated
that: it is not practicable to apply in military commissions under this
order the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally
recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district
courts. . . . Having fully considered the magnitude of the potential
deaths, injuries, and property destruction that would result from
potential acts of terrorism against the United States, and the
probability that such acts will occur, I have determined that an
extraordinary emergency exists for national defense purposes, that this
emergency constitutes an urgent and compelling government interest, and
that issuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency.13 An
important detail about this extraordinary measure was that it only
applied to non-citizens of the United States; citizens suspected of
terrorism must be prosecuted under US criminal codes. Such orders invoke
what Schmitt called [the 'state of exception' wherein the existing legal
order is suspended and 'unlimited authority' seized by the sovereign to
meet a 'danger to the existence of the state']{.underline}. This, he
argues, [is the essence of sovereignty: 'Sovereign is]{.underline} he
who decides on the exception.'14 What is especially distinctive is not
only [the idealistic alignment of extra-judicial powers of life and
death with sovereignty, freed from]{.underline} the dominance of the
constitution and the [rule of law,]{.underline} but the enactment of an
uncertain threshold between law and the human in which the human can
disappear as a matter of executive power and whim 'in the interest of
the state, public safety and order'.15 Giorgio Agamben argues that 'what
is new about President Bush's order is that [it radically erases any
legal status of the individual, thus producing a legally unnameable and
unclassifiable being']{.underline}.16 Similarly, Judith Butler suggests
that [we are witnessing the emergence of]{.underline} 'normative
conceptions of the human that produce, through an exclusionary process,
a host of "unliveable lives" whose legal and political status is
suspended'; lives 'viewed and judged so that they are less than human,
or as having departed from the recognisable human community'.17 Agamben,
drawing on the work of Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault, has done most
to describe and denounce the violent and impoverished conceptualisation
of life implicit in such a politics. He saw in the convergence of a
Schmittian theory of sovereignty and what Foucault termed 'biopolitics'
[a diabolical system of political and administrative power that reduced
human existence to 'bare life' (Homo sacer) that 'may be killed and yet
not sacrificed]{.underline}' -- Homo sacer being 'an obscure figure of
archaic Roman law in which human life is included in the juridical order
solely in the form of its exclusion (that is, of its capacity to be
killed)'.18 He sees such a simultaneously exceptional and [biopolitical
power at work in 'the Camp', which took]{.underline} on its most
horrific [form in the Holocaust but]{.underline} is [also in operation
at the US prisons in Cuba and Abu Ghraib, and,]{.underline} as
Suvendrini Perera19 has shown, [at immigration detention
centres]{.underline} like Woomera and Baxter in remote South Australia,
where [sovereign power is unchecked and life is taken hold of outside
the existing legal order]{.underline} (or at least within a radically
unstable and arbitrary one). The camp, Agamaben argues, is 'the
biopolitical paradigm of the modern' and [the state of exception is
becoming normalised and universalised: it 'tends increasingly to appear
as the dominant paradigm of government in contemporary
politics']{.underline}.20 Agamben thus issues a profound warning for
anyone concerned with interrogating modern conceptions of security --
which, after all, posit the sovereign nation-state as the collective to
be secured and abrogate to government powers to protect the 'life' of
this collective. Yet [life is not valued equally and its 'protection'
comes with a simultaneous seizing of life by power:]{.underline} . . .
in the age of biopolitics [this power \[to decide which life can be
killed\] becomes emancipated from the state of exception and transformed
into the power to decide the point at which life ceases to be
politically relevant]{.underline}. When life becomes the supreme
political value, not only is the problem of life's nonvalue thereby
posed as Schmitt suggests, but further, it is as if the ultimate ground
of sovereign power were at stake in this decision. In modern
biopolitics, [sovereign is]{.underline} he [who decides on the value or
nonvalue of life]{.underline} as such.21 In a world where life and
existence are defined biopolitically, and government takes on the
responsibility to secure, enable, regulate and order life, Agamben
argues (after Foucault) that [it is as if: 'every decisive political
event were double-sided:]{.underline} the spaces, the liberties, and
[the rights won by individuals]{.underline} in their conflicts with
central powers [always simultaneously prepared a tacit but increasing
inscription of individuals' lives within the state order, thus offering
a new more dreadful foundation for the sovereign power from which they
wanted to free themselves]{.underline}.'22 In this light, the 'active
defense of the American people' comes to sound sinister indeed, for
Americans and their Others alike.

#### Securitization institutes fear as the organizing principle of politics, enabling the reproduction of a permanent state of exception

**Aradau & Van Munster 2009** \[Claudia, Prof of International Politics
and Co-chair of the Research Centre in IR, Rens, Senior researcher and
coordinator for the Peace, Risk and Violence research unit,
"Exceptionalism and the 'War on Terror': Criminology Meets International
Relations," British Journal of Criminology 49.5, p.689-92, GDI-GMW\]

Unpacking IR's reading of the exception is important in order to grasp
how the exception is more than a ' transparent tactic by political
authorities to gain the upper hand in the politics of authority '( Welch
2007 : 138). For Schmitt, [exceptionalism does not simply refer to the
creation of moral panics]{.underline} by means of which state elites can
further their interests, often by undermining civil liberties. Rather,
[it is a ' general concept in the theory of the state]{.underline} '(
Schmitt 1985 a) that accounts for the limits of order. In this
interpretation, crime and war share many similarities, opening a
dialogue between criminology and IR. Therefore, arguing that the
representation of the ' war on terror 'should be discarded in favour of
a criminal justice approach ( Zedner 2005 ) does not take into account
the similarities that counter-terrorist policies share when considered
from the perspective of exceptionalism. In IR, Marieke de Goede has
shown that distinctions between the US pre-emptive practices and the
European supposed reliance on the rule of law do not account for
European policies on data retention and asset freezing, for example.
These policies show Europe as a world leader in pre-emptive security
policies (De Goede 2008 b). Although criminological readings have
interpreted the exception through the role of the executive power at the
expense of judicial power, the perspective endorsed here argues that the
exception is constitutive of all law. The exception defi nes the
existence and possibility of the functioning of the law. Law and social
order depend upon a ' founding crime 'or upon an act of war. This is the
paradox of modern liberal political communities that defi ne themselves
as governed by the rule of law: the law needs a ' founding crime ' , a
moment of violence or injustice ---the exception ---in order to function
( Burke 2002 ; Derrida 2005 ). [Exceptional practices are not simply
irregular occurrences prompted by opportunistic defi nitions of threat,
but are constitutive of sovereignty, modern law and political
communities.]{.underline} For Schmitt, exceptionalism exists not only in
the capacity to override the law, but also in the capacity to call the
legal order into being: ' Order must be established for juridical order
to make sense. A regular situation must be created, and sovereign is he
who defi nitely decides if this situation is actually effective
'(Schmitt 1985 b: 13). Therefore, [exceptional policies have
constitutive effects upon society, which blur the distinction between '
normal 'law and ' extraordinary 'crime.]{.underline} Criminalization
undergirds the functioning of the law, although, in practice, there will
be differences in the degree of institutionalization of exceptionalism.
While writings on moral panic generally invoke stages of escalation (in
which there are calls for strong measures) and innovation (referring to
increased powers of the police), they remain wedded to an understanding
of moral panic as refl ective/non-refl ective rather than constitutive
of social reality ( Murji 2001 : 174 -- 5). Exceptions, we have
suggested, are constitutive of society and of what we take to count as
law and order. [Exceptionalism]{.underline}, moreover, [turns fear of
the enemy into the constitutive principle of social order.]{.underline}
In an IR perspective, [the politics of fear performs the ordering of the
community.]{.underline} According to Jef Huysmans (2006), exceptionalism
reshapes political communities in three respects: it redistributes fear
and trust, it reconsiders inclusion and exclusion and it institutes a
predisposition towards violence. 6 Although fear of crime has been an
important topos of criminological research, debates about state crimes
and moral panics often ignore the ways in which exceptional policies
revolving around fear feed back into society. Instead, fear has been
thought to be either an emotional reaction to elements associated with
crime, a political discourse of fear ( Furedi 2006 ; Mythen and Walklate
2006 a) or an ' unconscious displacement of other fears which are far
more intractable and do not display the modern characteristics of
knowability and decisionability '( Hollway and Jefferson 1997 : 263).
These defi nitions can be integrated in an analysis of moral panics as
distortions or exaggerations of criminal behaviour ( Rothe and Muzzatti
2004 ). IR scholars have argued that the construction of enemies and the
governance of dangers through exceptional policies do not simply concern
the identifi cation of threats or risks, perceptions or the cultural
underpinnings and meanings associated with a particular threat. Rather,
[the securitization of dangers is a ' politically constitutive act that
asserts and reproduces the unity of a political community '
(]{.underline}Huysmans 2006: 49). Exceptional policies, Huysmans (2004 :
338) has argued: ... are not simply about civil liberties, the legality
of going to war, and the constitutional limits to strengthening
executive-centred government. [Since these political, legal and social
contests strongly reiterate fear of the enemy they directly bear upon
the extent to which one is structuring and possibly institutionalizing
fear of the enemy as the organizing principle of politics in both
national and international society.]{.underline} The question then
becomes to what extent [security responses that claim to aim at
protecting freedom and equality are actually displacing freedom and
equality with fear of the enemy as the central principle around which
politics is organized.]{.underline} Huysmans has expanded the
conceptualization of the exception in relation to law by unpacking the
matrix of liberal power as consisting of a tripartite relationship
between the rule of law, political leadership and the popular will. This
means that th[e exception is not only a question of the limits of
law]{.underline} and the increasing role of discretion within late
modern legal arrangements, but also underpins questions of political
representation and of the constitution of law ( Huysmans 2004 ). [The
exception allows for the arbitrary exercise of power by both political
leadership and the ' people ']{.underline}and undermines the
constitution of law through the ' will of the people ' . It also severs
the external representative links between political leadership and the
people. This raises questions not just about how the norm needs an
exceptional constitutive moment, but also about how exceptional measures
distort and challenge the functions of representation in liberal
democracies. This approach has informed IR analyses that have revealed
the continuities within liberal states of illiberal practices that stem
from the exceptional governance of risks and dangers ( Aradau and van
Munster 2007 ; 2008; De Goede 2008 b; Neocleous 2008 ). [Fear integrates
political communities according to friend/enemy lines and creates
homogeneous identities that need to be defended. The politics of fear
collapses processes of representation and unifi es the ' people 'and the
political leadership.]{.underline} Unlike some of the criminological
literature, [fear is]{.underline} understood not as an emotion, but as
[a ' particular principle of making human relations intelligible in a
certain way ']{.underline} (Huysmans 2006: 52). The construction of
enemies is simultaneously undertaken domestically and internationally;
not only are decisions upon the enemy intimately connected with the
limits of law, but defi nitions of what counts as liberal universal law
are possible through the separation of a realm of modernity and
Enlightenment from the rest of world and defi nitions of civilization
from barbarism. In this view, the exception entails important questions
about how the international ' war on terror 'is fought in conjunction
with domestic policing. The international is probably one of the most
neglected dimensions in the governance of crime, having been associated
with traditional inter-state relations. Generally, criminology has used
the concept of ' transnationalization 'to describe processes and
practices that transgress national boundaries ( Sheptycki 2005 ).
Nonetheless, the international implies other processes of carving up the
world besides the recent emergence of transnational authorities and
professionals. Rob Walker has drawn attention to the role of the
exception and particularly the construction of friend/enemy relations
for dividing up the international. He has singled out three concepts
that have been used in IR to think of the world: international, imperial
and exceptional ( Walker 2006 ). ' International 'is the traditional
concept of inter-nations, inter-states, the negotiations and commerce
between states that have been often thought of in violent and war-like
terms. Traditional understandings of the international have followed
Thomas Hobbes's metaphor of the ' state of nature 'as the anarchic war
of everyone against everyone. ' Imperial 'is the more recent rendering
of the international as a realm no longer dominated by inimical
relations between nation-states, but structured by different forms of
vertical power, variously defi ned as neo-liberalism, globalization or
empire. The ' exceptional 'raises questions about sovereign authority
internationally and which sovereign capacity has priority. Is it the
sovereignty of the state, imperial or hegemonic sovereignty, or the
sovereignty of democracy? Answers to these questions entail particular
defi nitions of limits in relation to which the exception functions.
According to Walker, [the exception is articulated at the supra-national
level as a claim about inhumanity]{.underline} (those who are not yet
modern or need to be helped to become modern) [or about
empire]{.underline} (the transcendence of international hegemony and the
antagonisms between states to the community of humanity). ' [Construct
the other as barbarian, as that which must be civilized or
destroyed]{.underline}, 'Walker cautions, ' [and the way is open to the
declaration of exceptions that affi rm the suspension of modern
achievements and the authorization of absolute authority, whether
understood as empire or as the fi nal victory of a singular way of being
human]{.underline} '( Walker 2006 : 76 -- 7). The civilizational
underpinnings of exceptionalism can also be traced in Schmitt's work. In
The Nomos of the Earth, Schmitt (2003) explicitly argued for upholding
the plurality of states as found in the nineteenth century Jus Publicum
Europaeum against what he saw as the dehumanization of the enemies of
liberalism. [The sovereign state integrated individuals into a political
order and organized legitimate modes of authority through the staging of
an external threat: ' Every religious, moral, economic, ethical, or
other antithesis transforms into a political one if it is suffi ciently
strong to group human beings effectively according to friend and
enemy]{.underline} '(Schmitt 1996: 37). Nonetheless, the construction of
enemies within the European system of state remained a relation between
equals, while liberal universalism pushed enemies beyond the boundaries
of humanity. [The enemy of liberalism]{.underline}, according to
Schmitt, [becomes equated with inhumanity and evil.]{.underline}

#### Securitization of life guarantees never-ending war and violence justified as "necessary killing" to save the life of the species

Deciding on [what elements and expression of the human both serve and
threaten]{.underline} is the [definitive operation by which liberalism
constitutes its referent object of war and rule:]{.underline} that of
the biohuman. [Whatever resists]{.underline} the
[constitution]{.underline} of the [biohuman is hostile and
dangerous]{.underline} to it, even if it arises within the species
itself. Indeed, as we shall show, since [life is now]{.underline} widely
[defined in terms of continuous emergence]{.underline} and becoming, it
is a [continuous becoming-dangerous to itself]{.underline}. The [locus
of threat and danger under the liberal way of rule and war progressively
moves into the very morphogenic composition and re-composability of
living systems and of living material]{.underline}. The [greatest source
of threat to life becomes life.]{.underline} It is very [important to
emphasize that this discourse of danger is precisely]{.underline} not
that which commonly [arises in the political]{.underline} anthropologies
of human cupidity of early modern political theory going back
classically, for example, to Hobbes and Locke, which was nonetheless
still formulated in a context still circumscribed by the infinity of
divine providence, however obscure this was becoming, and however much
this obscurity helped fuel the crisis of their times. The analytics of
finitude, [rather than the analytics of redemption, circumscribe late
modem discourses of governance and danger now, instead]{.underline}.
Biology, one might therefore also say[, itself arose as a science of
finitude]{.underline}; of [the play of species life and death out with
the play of human life and redemption.]{.underline} The same might very
well be said for [modern \'political science]{.underline}.\' Biology
does not, of course, recognize cupidity. [Cupidity arises in a
different, anthro-political, order of things.]{.underline} These days,
especially, [biology recognizes only the dynamics of complex adaptive
evolutionary emergence and change of living systems, whose vary laws of
formation it increasingly understands in informational
terms.]{.underline} These, additionally, empower it to re-compose living
material according to design rather than nature in order to rectify the
infelicities of nature, or, indeed, pre-empt its expression by
positively creating new nature, rather than merely negating existing
nature. [Pre-emption here is not negative, it is positive]{.underline}.
It is not precaution, so much as creative production. The discourse of
danger being elaborated throughout the liberal way of rule and war, in
the age of life as information, is therefore related to the possibility
that complex adaptive emergence and change can go acerbic. The
[possibility of catastrophe lies, immanently, in the very dynamics of
the life process itself]{.underline}. Neither is this a discourse of
danger which revolves around traditional othering practices alone,
however pervasive and persistent these politically toxic devices remain.
This is a discourse of danger which hyperbolicizes fear in relation to
the radically contingent outcomes upon which they very liveliness of
life itseld is now said to depend. Biohumanity - itself is an expression
of the [attempt to give concrete form to finitude politically - is
therefore both threat and promise.]{.underline} the corollary is
therefore also clear: [enemies of the species must be cast out from the
species as such. \'Just war\' in the cause of humanity]{.underline}
here - a constant liberal trope (Douzinas 2003) - takes a novel turn
when the humanity at issue is biohumanity. [For just war has constantly
to be waged for biohumanity against the continuous becoming-dangerous of
life itseld;]{.underline} and less in the form of the Machiavellian or
Hobbesian Homo lupus than in the form of continuously emergent being,
something which also prompts the thought that Foucault\'s analytics of
finitude might itself have to be revised to take account the infinity of
becoming which now also [characterizes the contemporary ontology of life
sciences]{.underline}. [Since the object is to preserve and promote the
biohuman, any such war to end war becomes war without end;]{.underline}
thus turning Walzer\'s arguments concerning the justification of liberal
war inside out (Walzer 2000: 329-35). The [project of removing war from
the life of the species becomes a lethal and, in principle, continuous
and unending process]{.underline}. In a way, as a matter of its
biopolitical logic, there is little particularly startling about this
claim. Immanent in the biopoliticization of the liberal rule, [it is
only a matter of where, when and how it finds expression]{.underline}.
As the very composition and [dynamics of species life become the locus
of the threat to species life, so the properties of species life offer
themselves in the form of a new kind of promise: war may be removed from
the species should those properties be attended to
differently.]{.underline} Consider, for example, Kant\'s \'Idea for a
Universal History\'[: if he lives among others for his own species, man
is an animal who needs a master . . . he requires a master to break his
self-will and force him to obey a universally valid will under which
everyone can be free. But where is he to find such a
master]{.underline}? [Nowhere else but in the human
species]{.underline}. (Kant 2005: 46; emphasis added) \'Nowhere else but
in the human species.\' Here Kant, too, discloses the circumscription of
his reflections by the analytics of finitude. Put simply, liberalism\'s
strategic [calculus of necessary killing has, then, to be furnished by
the laws and dynamics, the exigencies and contingencies, derived from
the properties of the biohuman itself.]{.underline} Making life live
becomes the criterion against which the liberal way of rule and war must
seek to say how much killing is enough. In a massive, quite literally
terrifying, paradox, however, since the [biohuman is the threat it
cannot, itself, adjudicate how much self-immolation would be enough to
secure itself against itself without destroying itself]{.underline}.
However [much the terror of the liberal way of rule and war currently
revolves around the \'figure\']{.underline} of Al-Qaeda, the very
dispotif of terror which increasingly circumscribes the life of the
[biohuman at the beginning of the twenty-first century is the fear
induced by its very own account of li]{.underline}fe. No specific manner
or form is proper, then, to the biohuman other than this[: its being
continuously at work instrumentally reassigning itself in order, it is
said, to survive, but in fact to secure itself against its own vital
processes.]{.underline} Within the compass of this biopolitical
imaginary of species existence, the biohuman becomes the living being to
whom all manner of self-securing work must be assigned. The task thus
posed through the liberal way of rule and war by its referent object of
rule and war - [the biohuman - is no longer that, classically, of
assigning the human its proper nature with a view to respecting it. The
proper nature of the biohuman has become the infinite re-assignability
of the very pluripotency itself. This is the strategic goal of the
liberal way of war because it has become the strategic goal of the
liberal way of rule. From the analytics of finitude, politically, has
thus arisen an infinity of securitization and fear.]{.underline}

# China Threat Discourse

### Taiwan Defense Commitment

#### US commitment to Taiwan is rooted in an ethnocentric projection of American values and identity onto Taiwan in opposition to the Chinese "threat."

**Turner 2013** \[Oliver, Research Associate at the Brooks World Poverty
Institute at the University of Manchester, "'Threatening' China and US
security: the international politics of identity," *Review of
International Studies* 39.4, GDI-ATN\]

**[Despite this, certain realities are still able to be created within
which policies are made possible and justified, primarily for those who
continue to make China's identity foreign from that of the United
States.]{.underline}** [This can be seen for example in Washington's
enduring commitment to defend its core values in Taiwan]{.underline}.
Between 1995 and 1996 the PRC conducted a series of provocative missile
tests in the Taiwan Strait. Their purpose was to influence presidential
elections on the island and deter voters from appointing a
pro-independence candidate. **[The United States']{.underline}** Cold
War **[policy of maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan at the
expense of the PRC was partly enabled by representations of the former
as a threatened bastion of American values.]{.underline}** President
Dwight D. Eisenhower's intention to 'preserve the vital stake of the
free world in a free Formosa' was shared by President Clinton four
decades later when he ordered more American vessels into the Strait than
had been assembled in East Asia since the Vietnam War.102 Clinton's aim
was to defend America's **[material interests in the
region]{.underline}**. However, those interests **[remained constitutive
of discourses which gave them a particular meaning and which were framed
by understandings of an identity still present and vulnerable in the
region]{.underline}**. [Once more they were a boundary producing
performance and the goal]{.underline}, as Clinton confirmed, [was to
encourage the long term process of 'deepening the roots of democracy in
Asia']{.underline}.103 Of course, [efforts to lessen the possibility of
conflict]{.underline} are rarely to be condemned. The key point is that
these events [allude to the familiarly autobiographical nature of the
China 'threat' within American imaginations today, and to the centrality
of fantasised representations of that threat to policy processes in
Washington.]{.underline}104 Specifically, the incident exposes how
per[vasive, subjective truths about China (as well as of Taiwan and the
United States) could still formulate a reality within which US
intervention in the region could be legitimised in defence of American
identity]{.underline}. Indeed, [those truths ensured that anything other
than intervention was implausible]{.underline}. In July 1996 the Clinton
administration declared [that 'the United States has a continuing
interest and a continuing presence in the Asia-Pacific region and . . .
we're not going anywhere']{.underline}.105 Since 2002 [annual reports by
the Department of Defence on the military capabilities of the PRC have
included a dedicated section to the specific issue of Taiwan's
security]{.underline}.106 In 2005 **[it was argued explicitly in the
Senate that Taiwan and United States were particularly vulnerable to the
emerging China 'threat'.]{.underline}**107 [The continuing isolation of
these two polities in this context further demonstrates their partial
conflation within American imaginations, so that a threat to Taiwan is
still necessarily a threat to the United States]{.underline}. On 14
January 2012 President Obama restated that, while in principle the
[United States]{.underline} would continue to pursue a 'One China
Policy', its [relations with Taiwan were grounded upon values not shared
with Beijing]{.underline}. 'The relationship between the people of the
United States and the people of Taiwan is based on common interests and
a shared commitment to freedom and democracy', he declared.108

#### Commitment to defending Taiwan is grounded in constructions of China as an inherently dangerous foreign Other

**Turner 2013** \[Oliver, Research Associate at the Brooks World Poverty
Institute at the University of Manchester, "'Threatening' China and US
security: the international politics of identity," *Review of
International Studies* 39.4, GDI-ATN\]

In addition, and just as they did throughout the mid-to-late nineteenth
century and the early Cold War period, **[acts of US China policy
continue to protect the identity from which the 'threat' is
produced]{.underline}**. [**This is most evident in the sustained
commitment to the defence of Taiwan**, by which China's identity is
affirmed as foreign to that of the United States and a threat to the
core values of capitalism and democracy]{.underline}. [This
policy]{.underline} strategy [constitutes a 'neocontainment' approach
designed to manage and control China's apparently threatening
behaviour]{.underline}.117 Indeed, as Washington announced its intention
in late 2011 to station an additional 2,500 American troops on the north
coast of Australia, Beijing interpreted the move as part a wider policy
of 'hostile encirclement'.118 To paraphrase Campbell, [the presence of
an opposing identity which challenges understandings about the self can
be enough to produce assumptions of a threat]{.underline}.119 Today,
[China's (particularly nondemocratic) identity continues to be
dislocated from that of the United States]{.underline}, so that '[almost
by its mere]{.underline} geographical [existence China has been
qualified as an absolute strategic ''other'']{.underline} \[of the
United States\], a discursive construct from which it cannot escape'.120
Once again, these are the processes which explain how **[particular
courses of American foreign policy are enabled, towards a particular
type of manufactured China 'threat'.]{.underline}** During the
mid-to-late nineteenth century and the early Cold War period China had
the potential to endanger US security. However, in both cases **[the
'threats' perceived were products of American
imaginations]{.underline}**. For the most part they were produced with
the intention of **[legitimising policy strategies which could protect
the socially constructed (white and democratic-capitalist) American
identity]{.underline}**. [Material forces]{.underline}, while not
insignificant, [were insufficient to explain both the extent to which
China was perceived as a danger and the policy procedures implemented in
response.]{.underline} Today's China 'threat' does not yet pose a
comparable crisis to American identity. However, assessments of material
forces alone remain inadequate explanatory factors of the 'dangers' it
is understood to present. **[China remains the subject of an American
lens]{.underline}**, **[interpreted]{.underline}** by many **[as a
threat]{.underline}** **[through representations of its status as a
necessarily dangerous foreign other]{.underline}**.

### General

#### China threat discourses are grounded in and productive of white supremacy. The fundamental being of American self-identity requires the specter of the Chinese other

**Turner 2013** \[Oliver, Research Associate at the Brooks World Poverty
Institute at the University of Manchester, "'Threatening' China and US
security: the international politics of identity," *Review of
International Studies* 39.4, GDI-ATN\]

The article draws in part from the work of David Campbell who suggests
that [**dangers in the international realm are invariably threats to
understandings about the self**. 'The mere existence of an alternative
mode of being',]{.underline} argues Campbell, '[the presence of which
exemplifies that different identities are possible . . . is sometimes
enough to produce the understanding of a threat.']{.underline}19 As a
result[, interpretations of global danger can be traced to the processes
by which states are made foreign from one another through discourses of
separation and difference]{.underline}.20 In this analysis it is
demonstrated that particular [American discourses have historically made
the US foreign from China]{.underline}. Case study one for example
demonstrates that **[nineteenth century racial discourses of non-white
immigrant Chinese separated China from a United States largely defined
by its presumed Caucasian foundations]{.underline}**. In case study two
we see that [Cold War ideological discourses of communism distanced the
PRC from the democratic-capitalist US]{.underline}. These types of
discourses are shown to have constituted a 'specific sort of boundary
producing political performance'.21 Across the history of Sino-US
relations then when ['dangers' from China]{.underline} have emerged,
they [have always been perceived through the lens of American
identity]{.underline}. In consequence, they have always existed as
dangers to that identity. In this analysis it is argued that [a key
purpose of depicting China as a threat has been to protect components of
American identity (primarily racial and ideological) deemed most
fundamental to its being]{.underline}. As such, **[representations of a
threatening China have]{.underline}** most commonly [been advanced by,
and served the interests of, those who support actions to defend that
identity]{.underline}. The case study analyses which follow reveal that
this has included [politicians and policymaking circles]{.underline},
such as those within the administration of President Harry Truman which
[implemented]{.underline} the [Cold War containment]{.underline} of the
PRC. It also exposes the complicity of [other societal individuals and
institutions]{.underline} including elements of the late
nineteenth-century American media which [supported restrictions against
Chinese immigration to the western United States.]{.underline} It is
demonstrated that, twice before, this discursive process of separating
China from the United States has resulted in a crisis of American
identity. [Crises of identity occur when the existing order is
considered in danger of rupture. The prevailing authority is seen to be
weakened and rhetoric over how to reassert the 'natural' identity
intensifies]{.underline}.22 Case studies one and two expose how such
crises have previously emerged. [These moments were characterised by
perceived attacks upon **core assumptions about what the United States
was understood to be: fundamentally white in the late nineteenth
century** and democratic-capitalist in the early Cold War]{.underline}.
Case study three shows that while today's China 'threat' to US security
is yet to generate such a crisis, we must learn from those of the past
to help avoid the types of consequences they have previously
facilitated.

#### Historical and ideological understandings of China determine US "threat" assessments -- policies manufacture and enable these representations

**Turner 2013** \[Oliver, Research Associate at the Brooks World Poverty
Institute at the University of Manchester, "'Threatening' China and US
security: the international politics of identity," *Review of
International Studies* 39.4, GDI-ATN\]

In March 2011 US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper
informed the American Senate that, of all sovereign nations, China
represented the most imminent 'mortal threat' to the United States.
While China's intentions were not necessarily malicious, he argued, it
had the capacity to present such a danger. Russia was also cited but
quickly dismissed as Clapper observed that China's 'strategic nuclear
weapons' arsenal in particular made it an issue of the foremost
concern.1 China's nuclear weapons stockpile is estimated at around 240
warheads. Russia's stands at around 12,000.2 Yet, and despite the clear
superiority of the latter's nuclear armament, Clapper repeatedly
emphasised that it was China's capabilities and not its intent which
were central in its elevation to such an extreme category of threat.
Director Clapper's assertions are reflective of **[the so-called China
Threat Theory]{.underline}** which now **[attracts considerable Western
attention, especially within the United States]{.underline}**. In the
[International Relations (IR) literature]{.underline} authors including
John Mearsheimer examine US policy options towards a real or potential
China threat. Mearsheimer [argues that China's growth will almost
inevitably cause tensions with the United States]{.underline},
presenting a 'considerable potential for war'.3 Warren Cohen predicts
[that China will continue to 'brutaliz\[e\] the weak', and follow great
powers of the past by seeking regional dominance before expanding its
influence further]{.underline}.4 Certainly, much of the recent
literature is less foreboding of China's 'rise' and authors question the
extent to which it endangers international security. Gordon Chang, for
example, argues that China's economic model -- and hence its capacity to
become a true global superpower -- is flawed.5 Brown et al. are broadly
positive about China's development, with engagement rather than
containment the preferred US policy response.6 Others reject the
conflation of a 'rising' China with a 'dangerous' China.7 What
protagonists of both sides of the argument demonstrate in equal measure,
however, is the tendency to assume that a single physical reality about
China can be determined. [This aim of classifying China as a
threat]{.underline} (or indeed a non-threat) [is a legacy of the
historical dominance within IR of the overtly positivist neorealist and
neoliberal schools]{.underline}.8 Positivist approaches to the
discipline rely upon testable theory and empirical analysis with the
expectation that the world can be definitively understood. The
traditional influence of these approaches has precluded a more
widespread appreciation of how, in fact, a single authoritative
understanding about China is unachievable. The inherent contestability
and subjectivity of judgments about that country was once noted by John
King Fairbank who argued that '\[a\]t any given time the ''truth'' about
China is in our heads'.9 From this understanding [**the existence (or
absence) of a China threat** cannot be satisfactorily explained with
reference to material forces alone. The 'threat']{.underline} described
by Director Clapper **[can never be dispassionately observed through
assessments of an external world,]{.underline}** as he seemingly claimed
to be able to do. The purpose of this article is not to speculate as to
whether China 'is' or 'is not' a threat to the United States. It does
not concern itself with China's nuclear arsenal nor dispute the
existence and expansion of its capabilities, or the possibility of there
being a cause of future violence. It argues that **[while the material
realities of China are important, the nature and extent of their
importance is, and has always been, regulated by ideas]{.underline}**.
Of course, the understanding that international affairs are guided by
more than the distribution of state capabilities is not original; it has
long been a primary contestation of the 'critical', or post-positivist,
IR movement that the world is mutually constitutive of material and
ideational forces.10 Moreover, authors including Evelyn Goh emphasise
the centrality of ideas within Sino-US relations and to the formulation
of US China policy at key moments.11 Chengxin Pan specifically examines
[the China 'threat' as a discursive construction]{.underline} and its
importance to Washington's relations with Beijing.12 Beyond these
important works the discipline remains relatively quiet on **[the
salience of ideational forces in producing a fantasised China 'threat'
and in enabling US policies in response]{.underline}**.13 It also
broadly fails to explain how [those policies themselves reinforce the
understandings which make them possible in the first place.]{.underline}
This is the arena of enquiry towards which the article is directed. It
contributes to a small but growing literature which challenges the
contours of the modern day China Threat Theory, exposing it as
fundamentally flawed and even potentially dangerous. It does this by
demonstrating that, [**in many respects, today's China 'threat' to US
security conforms to those which have emerged before**.]{.underline} It
shows how, [across the duration of Sino-US relations, China 'threats'
have always emerged in part from representation and interpretation and
thus how fears about that country today continue to be manufactured and
engineered in a way not unique from those of the (sometimes distant)
past]{.underline}. In late 2011 [the]{.underline} [Obama
administration]{.underline} shifted its foreign policy focus from
Afghanistan and Iraq to the [Asia Pacific]{.underline}.14 To a
significant extent this '[pivot']{.underline}, as it is commonly
described[, is motivated by the growth of China]{.underline}.
Accordingly, [as increasing concentrations of US political, economic,
and military recourses are diverted to the Asian region, American
perceptions of China and their significance to the enactment of
Washington's foreign policies there have once more become increasingly
pertinent.]{.underline}

#### China threat discourses are inherently socially constructed -- they justify demands for action and create self-fulfilling prophecies

**Turner 2013** \[Oliver, Research Associate at the Brooks World Poverty
Institute at the University of Manchester, "'Threatening' China and US
security: the international politics of identity," *Review of
International Studies* 39.4, GDI-ATN\]

[The modern day China 'threat' to the United States is not an
unproblematic, neutrally verifiable phenomenon. It is an imagined
construction of]{.underline} American design and the product of
[societal representations which]{.underline}, to a significant extent,
[have established the truth that a 'rising' China endangers US
security.]{.underline} This is an increasingly acknowledged, but still
relatively under-developed, concept within the literature.121 The
purpose of this article has been to expose how 'threats' from China
towards the United States have always been contingent upon subjective
interpretation. The three case studies chosen represent those moments
across the lifetime of Sino-US relations at which China has been
perceived as most threatening to American security. The 'threats'
emerged in highly contrasting eras. The nature of each was very
different and they emerged from varying sources (broadly speaking, from
immigration in the nineteenth century and from 'great power' rivalry in
the twentieth and twenty-first centuries). Yet in this way they most
effectively demonstrate how China 'threats' have repeatedly existed as
socially constructed phenomenon. Collectively **[they reveal the
consistent centrality of understandings about the United States in
perceptions of external danger.]{.underline}** They demonstrate that,
[regardless of China's ability to assert material force or of the manner
in which it has been seen to impose itself upon the United States, the
reality of danger can be manufactured and made real]{.underline}. China
'threats' have always been threats to American identity so that the
individual sources of 'danger' -- whether a nuclear capability or an
influx of (relatively few) foreign immigrants -- have never been the
sole determining factors. As James Der Derian notes, [danger can be
ascribed to otherness wherever it may be found]{.underline}.122 During
the mid-to-late nineteenth century and throughout the early Cold War,
perceptions of China 'threats' provoked crises of American identity. The
twenty-first-century China 'threat' is yet to be understood in this way
but it remains inexplicable in simple material terms. As ever, the
physical realities of China are important but they are interpreted in
such a way to make them threatening, regardless of Beijing's intentions.
Most importantly, this article has shown how [processes of
representation have been complicit at every stage of the formulation,
enactment, and justification of US China policy]{.underline}. Their
**[primary purpose has been to dislocate China's identity from that of
the United States and introduce opportunities for action]{.underline}**.
Further, [those policies themselves have reaffirmed]{.underline} the
[discourses of separation and difference]{.underline} which make China
foreign from the United States, protecting American identity from the
imagined threat. Ultimately, this analysis has sought to expose the
inadequacy of approaches to the study of US China policy which privilege
and centralise material forces to the extent that ideas are subordinated
or even excluded. Joseph Nye argues that [the China Threat Theory has
the potential to become a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}. Based
upon a crude hypothetical assumption that there exists a 50 per cent
chance of China becoming aggressive and a 50 per cent chance of it not,
Nye explains, to treat China as an enemy now effectively discounts 50
per cent of the future.123 In such way he emphasises [the ideational
constitution of material forces and the power of discourse]{.underline}
to [create selected truths about the world so that certain courses of
action are enabled while others are precluded]{.underline}. Assessments
such as those of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper in
March 2011 should therefore not only be considered misguided, but also
potentially dangerous. For while they appear to represent authoritative
statements of fact they actually rely upon subjective assumptions about
China and the material capabilities he describes. In late 2010 President
Obama informed Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao that 'the American people
\[want\] to continue to build a growing friendship and strong
relationship between the peoples of China and the United States'.124 The
hope, of course, is that a peaceful and cooperative future can be
secured. Following the announcement that the Asia Pacific is to
constitute the primary focus of Washington's early twenty-first-century
foreign policy strategy, American interpretations of China must be
acknowledged as a central force within an increasingly pertinent
relationship. The basis of their relations will always be fundamentally
constituted by ideas and history informs us that particular American
discourses of China have repeatedly served to construct vivid and
sometimes regrettable realities about that country and its people.
Crucially, it tells us that they have always been inextricable from the
potentialities of US China policy. As Sino-US relations become
increasingly consequential [the intention must be for American
representations of the PRC -- and indeed Chinese representations of the
United States -- to become the focus of more concerted scholarly
attention. Only in this way can the contours of those relations be more
satisfactorily understood, so that the types of historical episodes
explored in this analysis might somehow be avoided in the
future.]{.underline}

### Relations / Cooperation

#### The Aff's seemingly benign representations of US/China cooperation are inextricable from orientalist ideology. The "threat" of China looms in the background as "potential" threat, justifying logics of American exceptionalism

**Ooi and D'Arcangelis 2017** \[Su-Mei, associate Professor of Political
Science at Butler University, and Gwen, associate professor of Gender
Studies at Skidmore College, "Framing China: Discourses of Othering in
US News and Political Rhetoric," *Global Media and China*, 2.3-4,
GDI-ATN\]

The relationship of the United States and People's Republic of China
(China) is arguably one of the most important in this century. The
ability of the United States and China to maintain a cooperative
relationship will shape, to a large extent, outcomes on key global
issues such as the stability and growth of the global economy, resource
scarcity, climate change, and the nonproliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. Since President Nixon's policy of constructive engagement
over four decades ago, the strategic partnership of the two has grown to
an extent unimaginable back in 1972. [The alignment of strategic
interests between the two has led to policies of undeniable mutual
benefit to date]{.underline}---on one hand, China's access to world
markets has allowed its economy to grow at impressive rates; on the
other hand, this growth has helped to sustain US spending and thus, its
maintenance of global hegemony.1 In recent years, however, sharp
disagreements have surfaced on numerous fronts, and the United States
has sought to maintain dominance in the partnership. [One of the
mechanisms that have facilitated this, we argue, is the construction of
China via long-standing Orientalist tropes that, at once flexible and
durable, are easily mobilized and adapted for strategic political
ends]{.underline}. As formulated by foremost scholar Edward Said (2014),
depictions of the "Orient" have served as ideological tools aiding
empires since the late 18th century---first the British and French,
subsequently, the United States. [The role of knowledge production in
the colonial project]{.underline}, which Said termed "Orientalism," [has
relied]{.underline} primarily [on producing images of the "Orient"
in]{.underline} dualistic [terms that]{.underline} serve to [affirm
Western cultural superiority]{.underline}---for example, in depicting
the "Orient" as backward, the West becomes civilized; in casting the
former as superstitious, the latter becomes scientific; in describing
the former as irrational, the latter becomes rational; in representing
the former as archaic, the latter becomes modern; in fashioning the
former as evil, the latter becomes good; in painting a picture of the
former as violent, the latter becomes peaceful. The affirmation of
Western superiority and concomitantly, the cultural and moral
inferiority of the "Orient," have served to justify Western expansion
and global control over lands, peoples, and resources. Western
construction of the cultural and moral inferiority of China has had a
long history and includes an array of portrayals that can be read in
light of specific European and US colonial aims. These include images of
China as exotic and immoral in the 1700s, as a cunning and diabolical
"Yellow Peril" in the late 1800s, as a freedom-loving and
democracy-loving "China Mystique" during World War II, and as an
ideological, economic, and military "Red Peril" during the Cold War
(Kim, 2010; Leong, 2005). Since the end of the Cold War and the
definitive establishment of US global hegemony, [China has vacillated in
the US imaginary between]{.underline} the latter two positions, viewed
[at times]{.underline} as a little brother [following imperfectly the
path toward modernity, at times imperiling the world order]{.underline}
(Kim, 2010; Vukovich, 2012). **[This ambiguity continues to occur
through the present day]{.underline}** and, **[in light of China's rise
as a global power since the late 1990s, China is increasingly portrayed,
not necessarily an enemy, but always a potential one.]{.underline}**
**[This construction of China as a potential enemy Other reflects the
relationship of mutual interdependence carefully cultivated by many US
administrations at the same time that it functions to justify the
paternalistic monitoring and policing of China to ensure that China
never overtakes the United States on the world stage]{.underline}**.
With this frame in mind, we examine the recapitulation of Orientalist
tropes in the post-Cold War context, focusing, in particular, on
representations and language used in US news media and political
rhetoric. We examine three highly charged economic and security issue
areas where the [othering of China]{.underline} is perceptible: (1)
China's currency valuation, (2) cyber intrusions that target commercial
and military information, and (3) maritime territorial and exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) disputes. We focus on three tropes that emerged in
our analysis of each of these areas: [China as cheat, thief, and lawless
bully]{.underline}, respectively. [Each trope can be situated in
relation to Orientalism, and]{.underline} thereby, we argue[,
recapitulates (or attempts to recapitulate) US dominance]{.underline}.
As these Orientalist tropes are likely to detract from the ability of
the US public to make fair assessments of US China policy, [we also
counter these Orientalist depictions with a more nuanced picture of
China's policies and actions, in the process demonstrating how one might
come to better understand these specific issue areas in the US--China
bilateral relationship]{.underline}. Before doing so, we turn to a brief
discussion of our data sources and methods.

### "Rising China" Rhetoric

#### Representations of a "rising China" are a socially constructed narrative of dramatic great power tensions

**Turner 2013** \[Oliver, Research Associate at the Brooks World Poverty
Institute at the University of Manchester, "'Threatening' China and US
security: the international politics of identity," *Review of
International Studies* 39.4, GDI-ATN\]

China's military and economic strengths are far greater today than at
any point in the history of Sino-US relations. Yet, the 'threat' it
presents to American security is no less a social construction than in
the past. **[The modern day proliferation of]{.underline}** popular and
academic '**[China threat' literatures]{.underline}** in particular
**[is reflective of the increasingly widespread conviction that a
'rising' China inevitably constitutes a real or potential
danger.]{.underline}**97 Robert [Kaplan explains that 'the American
military contest with China in the Pacific will define the twenty first
century']{.underline}.98 He **[does not question if or even when China
might become a threat. He emphasises its inevitability.]{.underline}**
Babbin and Timperlake [provide a fictional **narrative of future
Sino-American tensions**]{.underline} in which, among other things,
China uses cyber warfare to shut down American defence systems. [The
hostile scenario they present, it is argued, 'could easily become fact .
. . The Verdict: China means war.']{.underline}99 Certainly, and as has
been the case throughout history, China is not uniformly perceived in
these terms. Among a significant proportion of the American population,
however, the China 'threat' is an accepted and relatively unproblematic
phenomenon. [China now has the world's largest population, the fastest
growing economy, the largest army, the largest middle class, a permanent
seat on the UN Security Council, a manned space program and a nuclear
arsenal.100 Yet, all of these things do not necessarily make China a
threat]{.underline}. [Countries which share variations of these,
notably]{.underline} the possession of [nuclear weapons, a permanent
presence in the Security Council and significant standing armies are not
perceived in this way]{.underline}. Indeed, and as Director Clapper
revealed in the Senate in early 2011, [states like Russia with far
greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons and significant additional
military hardware can be viewed in less threatening terms]{.underline},
even when capability is cited as the critical factor.101 Furthermore,
the PRC has had a large population and a substantial army since its
founding in 1949, nuclear weapons since 1964 and a seat on the Security
Council since 1971 without consistently being interpreted as a threat.
Accordingly, [forces additional to those of China's capabilities must
still be implicated in understandings about the dangers it is said to
present]{.underline}.

### Espionage

#### Depictions of Chinese espionage invoke an orientalist narrative that hypocritically casts China as a "threat to civilization" 

**Ooi 2009** \[Su-Mei, associate Professor of Political Science at
Butler University, \"The Transnational Protection Regime and Taiwan\'s
Democratization,\" *Journal of East Asian Studies*, 9.1, GDI-ATN\]

The construction of China as potential enemy Other takes on an
additional hue when we look at the depictions of China's cyber
activities---China moves from cheat to a more malicious cousin, the
thief. The United States first focused on issues of "cyber warfare" in
the mid-2000s to late 2000s, but at the time, the trope associated with
China was not necessarily that of thief. In the mass news media, [a
militaristic lens framed much of the discussion, depicting China as a
rule breaker flouting international norms and thus posing a security
threat]{.underline}. For example, a Los Angeles Times article
highlighted that "China in the last year has developed ways to
infiltrate and manipulate computer networks around the world in what
U.S. defense officials conclude is a new and potentially dangerous
military capability, according to a Pentagon report" (Barnes, 2008).
[China is even placed in relation to al-Qaeda: "Cyber-attacks and
cyber-espionage pose a greater potential danger to U.S. national
security than Al Qaeda and other militants that have dominated America's
global focus since Sept. 11, 2001]{.underline}, the nation's top
intelligence officials said Tuesday" (Dilanian, 2013).
[This]{.underline} juxtaposition with al-Qaeda [only served to heighten
the military valence of China's cyber activities]{.underline}, and a
push to prepare for such a threat. Indeed, in the words of Senator Bill
Nelson (D-FL): "The threat, to be sure, is real---and, we cannot allow
ourselves to grow complacent ..." (Nelson 2008). [Snowden's revelations
of US spying on China in June of 2013 drastically changed the shape of
the discussion however]{.underline}. Snowden demonstrated that the NSA
(1) had two data centers in China from which it had been inserting spy
software into vulnerable computers; (2) targeted the Chinese University
of Hong Kong, public officials, businesses, and students; (3) hacked
mobile phones; and (4) in 2009, hacked the Pacnet headquarters in Hong
Kong, which runs one of the biggest regional fibre-optic networks. In
response to Snowden's revelations, a spate of articles compared the
United States' and China's hacking, displaying a range of attitudes from
journalists---[some espoused that both countries demonstrate equivalent
transgressive behavior, while others argued that China has crossed the
line into more aggressive hacking that goes beyond the United States'
more benign "preemptive" hacking. **The latter attitude indicates the
resilience of tropes of the Yellow and Red Perils, a China whose
inherent ideological and cultural differences with the West makes it a
threat.**]{.underline} The different lenses through which journalists
and pundits viewed China's spying in comparison with that of the United
States further invoke this Orientalist demarcation. An article in The
Washington Post thus contrasts China's behavior against that of the
United States, which merely seeks "to examine huge amounts of
communication metadata around the world to look for trends" and "to
preempt some threat against the U.S." China's spying is described,
however, as "infiltrating almost every powerful institution in
Washington, D.C.," "breaking into major news organizations," "stealing
sensitive military technology," and "stealing so much intellectual
property that China's hacking has been [called the 'greatest transfer of
wealth in history'" (Fisher, 2013). Drawing]{.underline} in particular
on incendiary words like "stealing" and "infiltrating," this article
distinguishes China as a sneaky thief. US journalists and pundits, in
charging China with stealing economic resources, have further solidified
the demarcation of China as an inferior and dangerous Other. A
well-circulated quote by national security pundit Adam Segal stated,
"The problem is we're not talking about the same things ... We're trying
to make a distinction between cyber economic espionage and normal
political- military espionage. The Chinese don't make that same
distinction" (Bengali & Dilanian, 2015). **[By portraying China as
unable to grasp the fundamental distinction between economics and
national security, Segal suggests China's thievery is connected to a
more fundamental character flaw]{.underline}**---China is unable to
grasp proper civilized norms. Similarly, [US official response has been
that China's view of data collection as a sovereign right has rendered
them essentially different from the United States and by implication,
the civilized world.]{.underline} That Chinese governmental espionage
involves the collection of economic intelligence that is shared with
Chinese companies further departs from civilized norms. Michael Rogers,
Director of the National Security Agency thus explained that "they
clearly don't have the same lines in the sand, if you will, with that
regard" (Bennett, 2015). Historically, US depictions of China as
uncivilized have occurred whenever China has gained power or threatened
US interests. [The narrative of China as a sort of child]{.underline}
following in the United States' footsteps on the path to modernity has
proven exceedingly popular since World War II and **[frames the US
approach to China as a potential ally and resource who at the same time
may never be civilizable]{.underline}** (Kim, 2010; Vukovich, 2012). In
**[this Orientalist narrative, China's journey to modernity is always
understood as precarious and, moreover, subject to US
vigilance]{.underline}** as to whether it meets the appropriate
benchmarks. The title of an editorial in The Washington Post epitomizes
current iterations of this sentiment and the ease with which Orientalist
imagery can be invoked to portray China's path to modernity as needing
US guidance when China falls out of line: "The US Needs to Tame the
Cyber-Dragon: Stronger Measures are Need\[ed\] to Block China's Economic
Espionage \[emphasis mine\]" ("The U.S. Needs to Tame," 2013). In
reality, [US vigilance can be attributed to the concern since the end of
the Cold War, that a "sleeping giant" able to challenge US global
hegemony is awakening]{.underline} (Kim, 2010). Thus, [the cultural work
done by portrayals of China as unable to adhere to civilized norms serve
to bolster the image of China as perpetually unprepared to be a
responsible member of the international community]{.underline}. In fact,
this narrative of China's thievery serves to persuade the American
public that China is a threat to the international community. One Wall
Street Journal journalist perfectly echoes this sentiment: A China that
leads the world in the theft of intellectual property, computer hacking
and resource nationalism will prove extremely destabilizing. If it
continues on this course, Beijing should not be surprised if other
countries begin to band together to collectively counter some of the
more harmful implications of China's rise. A better outcome for all will
be for China to embrace its responsibilities to help lead the world ...
(Metzl, 2011) [This]{.underline} article, [although hopeful that China
may at some future point become a responsible global actor, even leader,
ultimately reifies the notion that an increase in China's global power
is always suspect.]{.underline}

### SCS & ECS Scenarios

#### ECS and SCS scenario construction relies on tropes of a lawless China -- justifies US aggression and manifest destiny

**Ooi and D'Arcangelis 2017** \[Su-Mei, associate Professor of Political
Science at Butler University, and Gwen, associate professor of Gender
Studies at Skidmore College, "Framing China: Discourses of Othering in
US News and Political Rhetoric," *Global Media and China*, 2.3-4,
GDI-ATN\]

China as lawless bully: maritime disputes To cheat and thief, [we can
layer the trope of lawlessness, readily employed in media
representations and political rhetoric over maritime territorial
and]{.underline} EEZ [disputes involving China and its neighbors in the
Western Pacific]{.underline}. China's territorial claims in the South
China Sea are largely historical in nature and do encroach on the 200
nautical miles EEZ of neighboring countries such as the Philippines and
Vietnam. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
does not expressly prohibit land reclamation in the sea as long as due
notice is given to other concerned states and due regard to the rights
of other states (Art. 60.3, 56.2, and 56.3) is taken into account, while
the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment is
observed (Art. 192). Parties to a dispute are also obligated to refrain
from acting in a manner that would jeopardize or hamper a final
agreement resolving the dispute (Art. 74.3 and 83.3). The frantic
building of artificial islands to enhance the legality of China's
claims, unilateral installations, and skirmishes in the disputed areas
are thus amenable to interpretation as lawless bullying. An editorial in
the Wall Street Journal titled "Calling Out China's Lawlessness; The US
Points Out that Beijing's Claims to the South China Sea Don't Stand Up,"
describes the "sketchy legality of its \[Beijing's\] actions" and claims
that "China is changing the status quo in the South China Sea with force
and the threat of force" ("Calling Out," 2014). This characterization in
the media is consistent with political rhetoric. US Secretary of State
John Kerry was reported to have said in May 2014 that China's
"introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters
disputed with Vietnam was provocative" (Ives & Fuller, 2014). Eliot
Engel of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee framed
China's actions in skirmishes with Vietnam as "needless provocations"
(Engel, 2014). At the same time, media representations and political
rhetoric have tended to obscure the fact that China's regional neighbors
all built airstrips and outposts on the claimed islands long before
China ever did. China also displays inconsistent behavior in that it has
reached agreements with Vietnam in the Gulf of Tonkin and South Korea in
the Yellow Sea to divide fisheries equally and carry out joint
enforcement patrols in keeping with international law.3 Indeed, China
has in land disputes signed "fair and balanced" treaties with 13 out of
14 neighbors in keeping with international legal principles (Kraska,
2015). These instances have not, however, drawn any significant media
attention. Instead, [the emphasis on China's non-compliance with
international law in the South China Sea disputes has served to
recapitulate China in Orientalist terms as uncivilized and, moreover, as
a fully awakened "sleeping giant" that bullies its
neighbors]{.underline} and is unsuited to replace the US as regional
leader. [US political rhetoric and media representation has also
obscured the vagueness of international law when applied to the East
China Sea dispute as it would be inconsistent with the image of China as
a lawless bully in the South China Sea]{.underline}. The UNCLOS appears
to have a straightforward framework that gives states maritime
jurisdiction over resources 200 nautical miles from their coastal
baseline, but it says nothing about how overlapping maritime
jurisdictions are to be resolved. In the case of the East China Sea, the
area of dispute is only 360 miles across at its widest point. [At the
heart of the territorial dispute between China and Japan is the
"territorial acquisition" of the Senkaku/Diaoyutai islands, but there is
no convention on how states acquire sovereignty over disputed
territories]{.underline}.4 The flexibility of applicable principles in
international customary law have instead allowed both China and Japan to
invoke the law to justify their claims to sovereignty (Ramos-Mrosovsky,
2008). China's refusal to have the dispute adjudicated by an
international body reflects the unpredictability of outcomes and not
necessarily China's lawlessness, especially when viewed, in light of a
similar disinterest on the part of the Japanese. **[The essentialization
of China as lawless, despite the malleability of international law and
dissimilar behavior in other disputes, has the potential to drive a
wedge between China and her neighbors, thus "containing" China's growing
influence in the region]{.underline}**. Indeed, [the depiction of China
as a lawless bully plays up the insecurities of its
immediate]{.underline}---and in many cases, much weaker--- [neighbors,
whose heavy reliance on international law to constrain hegemonic
behavior is palpable.]{.underline} The breaking of norms has been
identified as a crucial signal that heightens threat perception
(Farnham, 2003). In the context of long-standing maritime territorial
disputes, **[playing up an image of China as a lawless bully also
suggests that the United States continues to be a necessary power broker
in the region.]{.underline}** The notion [that]{.underline} there is an
overbearing bully in the neighborhood that could care less about the
rules of the game [returns the United States to the role of protector in
the post-- Cold War period---its ostensible "manifest
destiny."]{.underline} Since the late 1990s, titles such as "Spratly
Spat Heats up over Chinese 'Bullying'" (Lamb, 1998) or "Asian Nations
Support US Silently" (Wiseman, 2001) demonstrate how constructing China
as a lawless bully serves to reinforce this purpose. Indeed, a recent
editorial in The Wall Street Journal makes this link explicit in the
text: Washington's hesitant response has allowed controversy to build
around freedom-of-navigation missions that should be routine. Beijing's
strategy in the South China Sea is to bully its neighbors and achieve
regional hegemony through coercive means short of war. Turning peaceful
naval patrols into diplomatic hot potatoes is exactly the sort of change
Beijing seeks. ("A 12-Mile," 2015) Here, China's behavior is portrayed
as incorrigibly belligerent, in distinct contrast to genteel US
diplomacy. One Wall Street Journal article makes this point clear in its
title alone: "Chinese Diplomacy Off Course; By Overreaching in the South
China Sea, Beijing has Drawn the US Irrevocably into the Debate" (Wain,
2000). This article embodies **[the dominant narrative]{.underline}**
that **[assumes implicitly the rightful role of the United States to
dole out proper diplomacy and take on any transgressors to maintain
world peace.]{.underline}** A Wall Street Journal article describing
China's "increasingly powerful---but highly opaque---military and its
more assertive stance \[towards the South China Sea\]" emphasize China's
military as an inherent threat to world order but construct the US
military according to a different standard, again assuming the
righteousness of US military intervention (Page, 2011). In this regard,
it is important to note that US grand strategy consists of preventing
the development of any regional power capable of obstructing US access
to Eurasia---where most of the world's resources and economic activity
are located. This long-term security goal has informed the Obama
administration's much-touted Pacific Pivot policy, which many have
viewed as a "China containment policy." A Congressional Report notes
that although U.S. policymakers have not often stated this key national
strategic goal explicitly in public, U.S. military (and diplomatic)
operations in recent decades---both wartime operations and day-to-day
operations---can be viewed as having been carried out in no small part
in support of this key goal. (O'Rourke, 2014) China's territorial claims
in the South China Sea cover about 90% of the area that could
potentially allow China to deny the United States such access. As China
continues with the modernization of its naval and air capabilities, US
apprehension has increased that the disputed land features in the South
China Sea are being used to bolster military and coast guard forces that
can monitor and respond to the activities of US allies, deny the US navy
access to these waters, and ultimately check US naval dominance in the
region. It is for this reason that the **[United States has insisted on
freedom of navigation and innocent passage---protected by
UNCLOS---through these contested waters, although tensions with China
have ratcheted up considerably as a result.]{.underline}** [As direct
conflict between the United States and China has become a real
possibility]{.underline}, and as the United States has not ratified the
UNCLOS, the [United States has attempted to base its actions on firm
legal principles, and in turn, to frame China's behavior in the region
as lawlessness.]{.underline} Through US portrayals of China as a lawless
bully, [China incurs reputational costs in the global and regional
community that have the potential to exert pressure on China to stand
down.]{.underline} The guided-missile destroyer USS Lassen was thus sent
in October 2015 on a "freedom of navigation" patrol within 12 nautical
miles of islands artificially built by China in the Spratly chain, which
the United States insists is in compliance with international law.5 The
United States revealed this aim in another dispute on whether China has
an international legal right to regulate foreign military actors
operating within China's 200-nautical-mile EEZ. The United States' view,
which China disagrees with, is that China has a right to restrict
military and surveillance activities only within 12 nautical miles of
its territorial waters. Tensions reached new heights when China
announced in November 2013 an East China Sea Air Defense Identification
Zone (ADIZ) that not only covered her territorial waters but extended
into its EEZ and thus, the contested areas in the East China Sea. US
Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel responded in a press statement that "We
view this development as a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo
in the region. [This unilateral action increases the risk of
misunderstanding and miscalculations," yet the United States followed
shortly by flying two B-52 bombers through the zone]{.underline}
(Harlan, 2013).

### Must Kritik

#### The kritik is a prior question -- china discourse must be interrogated before policy decisions can be made

**Turner 2013** \[Oliver, Research Associate at the Brooks World Poverty
Institute at the University of Manchester, "'Threatening' China and US
security: the international politics of identity," *Review of
International Studies* 39.4, GDI-ATN\]

[US China policy, however, must not be narrowly conceived as a 'bridge'
between two states]{.underline}.27 In fact, **[it works on behalf of
societal discourses about China to reassert the understandings of
difference upon which it relies]{.underline}**.28 Rather than a final
manifestation of representational processes, then, [US China policy
itself works to construct China's identity as well as that of the United
States]{.underline}. As the case study analyses show, [it perpetuates
discursive difference through the rhetoric and actions]{.underline}
(governmental acts, speeches, etc.) [by which it is advanced and the
reproduction of a China 'threat' continues]{.underline}. In such a way
it constitutes the international 'inscription of foreignness',
protecting American values and identity when seemingly threatened by
that of China.29 As Hixson asserts, "foreign policy plays a profoundly
significant role in the process of creating, affirming and disciplining
conceptions of national identity', and the United States has always been
especially dependent upon representational practices for understandings
about its identity.30 In sum, this article advances three principal
arguments. First, **[throughout history 'threats' from China towards the
United States have never been explicable in terms of material forces
alone. They have in part been fantasised, socially constructed products
of American discourse]{.underline}**. The physical contours of
Sino-American relations have been given meaning by processes of
representation so that China has repeatedl been made threatening no
matter its intentions. Second, [representations of China 'threats' have
always been key to the enactment and justification of US foreign
policies formulated in response]{.underline}. Specifically, [they have
framed the boundaries of political possibility so that certain policies
could be enabled while potential alternatives could be
discarded]{.underline}. Third, U[S China policies themselves have
reaffirmed discourses of foreignness and the identities of both China
and the United States,]{.underline} functioning to protect the American
identity from which the 'threats' have been produced. Research design
The data which informs this analysis is both primary and secondary and
was included on the basis of its relative influence during each of the
moments under review. Specifically, the American representations of
China which appear were chosen either because they constitute discourses
of difference which were more likely to have been absorbed by those in
policymaking circles, and drawn from during policy implementation, or
because they were advanced by policymakers themselves. For example, US
newspapers such as the New York Times, Washington Post, and San
Francisco Chronicle 'qualified' because of their relatively high
circulations and because, broadly speaking, they represent publications
of historical and contemporary standing. A geographically diverse
collection of newspapers was utilised to negate regional bias. Other
representations were similarly included because, to varying extents,
they have occupied a clear presence within American society. In some
cases the ideas about China they advance are shown to have been
reflected directly within policy rhetoric of the time, demonstrating
most profoundly how societal discourses have provided the rationale and
legitimacy for policy. The governmental documents examined, meanwhile,
are those which have been central to the enactment of US China policies.
They represent articulations of Washington administrations or key
individuals and groups in positions of influence at moments of policy
development and implementation. The sample of representations provided
could never entirely escape query or criticism. Nonetheless, **[the
purpose of interrogating comparatively more influential or 'politically
prominent' ideas about China is to conduct an analysis most capable of
exposing the significance of certain discourses to, and their
inextricability from, US China policy]{.underline}**. [The
argument]{.underline}, to confirm, [is not that a cause and effect
relationship between representations and policies can be
determined]{.underline}, or that any given [societal
representations]{.underline} can be considered complicit within
processes of policy implementation. It is that those **[which circulate
among higher numbers of groups and institutions and which are more
widely absorbed and reproduced over time are those which must be
afforded more attention]{.underline}**. This is because, as will be
shown, it is possible to reveal how **[they have collectively permeated
the policymaking process and helped create the realities in which the
possibility of acts of US China policy have been
introduced.]{.underline}**

# Genealogy

### Is Sweet

#### Genealogical critique that attends to the knowledge production undergirding contemporary security practices is key to challenging global systems of oppression and structural violence

**Wibben 16** \[Annick, Anna Lindh Professor for Gender, Peace &
Security @ Swedish Defence University, "Opening Security: recovering
critical scholarship as political," *Critical Studies on Security*,
GDI-MJS\]

[Since contexts and our location within them shape, limit, and enable
our research, critical scholarship]{.underline} further [necessitates
tracing]{.underline} the [history]{.underline} of a genre
(Gattungsgeschichte) [through]{.underline} a [genealogy]{.underline} of
a concept, idea, or issue area. [Such a genealogical trace]{.underline},
Vivienne Jabri asserts, [must be performed in relation to the current
context because 'the lived experiences of past generations come to form
the memory traces of the present, \[they are\] constitutive of life in
the present']{.underline}(2004, 266). For example, in their discussion
of sexual violence as a weapon of war, Maria Eriksson Baaz and Maria
Stern (2013) start byq uerying the not just 'the dominant story of
sexual and gender-based violence (the "Gendered" Story, as we call
it)'(14) asking questions about its plot, character construc-tion, and
more (see also Wibben2011), but also by digging into its genealogy 'by
first exploring the main account that precedes and haunts it (the
"Sexed" Story)' (Eriksson Baaz and Stern2013, 14). [The current social
and political context is 'a reflection of a distinct and particular
articulation of the present, emergent from a particular and distinct
reading of history]{.underline}, a particular subjectivity'(Jabri2004,
266). [Security Studies is not a neutral field of study but an
articulation of a particular configuration of events--which can and must
be challenged]{.underline} as critical feminists, postcolonial scholars
and poststructur-alists all point out, albeit from different starting
points. [Excavating these genealogies makes past transformations visible
and reveals potential points for further opening security.]{.underline}
While a deepening and broadening allows for some transformation as well,
an opening directly addresses the politics of Security Studies notj ust
in the abstract, but also in specific enactments. [To open security we
need to ask: 'How in the present does power operate?' and pay attention
'to structures of domination that permeate these
transformations']{.underline}(Jabri2004, 267). Jabri suggests that 'it
is relations of power that ultimately reveal [the congealment of
hegemonic, institutionalized practices]{.underline} that [determine the
legitimate, the acceptable, and the remits of
politics']{.underline}(2004). [Critical approaches challenge us to trace
the genealogies of what security has come to mean in particular
spatio-temporal locations]{.underline} (see also Ciutǎ2009), [while
engaging in a social analysis of those locations to articulate an
embedded critique]{.underline}. Security Studies is deeply implicated in
justifying and upholding the current interna-tional system; a system
shaped, in large part, by European imperialism and colonialism. Its
[knowledge practices are part and parcel of the (epistemic) violence
embedded in IR--they are implicated in creating and maintaining the
insecurities and injustices that critical scholarship should aim to
transform. Opening security lays bare how IR's limits on what
constitutes an acceptable research agenda, with attendant notions of
objectivity and scientism, negates politics and thus denies the
political nature of all knowledge claims. It is imperative]{.underline},
therefore, [to carefully scrutinize the politics of thinking about
security]{.underline} indifferent ways and, conversely, their enactment.
Insisting on the politics of Security Studies requires greater focus on
the axis of opening, in addition to a broadening and deepening. [This
opening]{.underline}, a strand of critical research that has been
present all along but has not been explicitly named, [is necessary to
generate new security imaginaries.]{.underline} Opening security
necessarily calls the frame into question and reveals how 'the frame
never quite contained the scene it was meant to limit \[\...\] something
was already outside which made the very sense of the inside possible,
recognizable'(Butler2009, 9). Security Studies has been too narrowly
focused on particular forms of (state) violence directed mostly at other
states. [Opening security with a critical (feminist) approach implies
challenging epistemic, direct, and structural violence,]{.underline} as
manifested in varied sites of study.[16It also entails revealing how
Security Studies frameworks contribute to these violences by limiting
what can be seen and heard]{.underline}, an endeavor which feminist
scholarship has successfully taken on. A more rigorous use of curiosity
and imagination would also allow non-feminist scholars in IR to see
that, despite claims to the contrary, 'the frame never quite determined
what it is we see, think, recognize, apprehend' (Butler2009, 9) and that
Security Studies, to remain relevant, must be disrupted by attention to
particular enactments of security that have always exceeded these
frames. All the while critical scholars need to remain reflexive and
explore the limits of their own horizons: What is it that we do not yet
know? How can we write and produce knowledges in such a way that allow
for the next person to question and displace them, if necessary? How
might we incorporate ambiguity and uncertainty for a more accurate
account of security that can be un-made and re-made, again and again?
[Only by recogniz-ing security as made, examining how it is enacted in
multiple locations, can we challenge the politics of security along with
its (oft violent) ties to the capitalist state. If we are serious about
emancipatory knowledges, we must challenge the ways Security Studies
supports intersecting systems of oppression, from racism and sexism to
imperialism.]{.underline}

#### A genealogy capable of challenging contemporary security structures must refuse the pull of easy "alternatives" -- this is key to new understandings and possibilities

**Der Derian 1998** \[James, "The Value of Security: Hobbes, Marx,
Nietzsche, and Baudrillard," ed. Ronnie Lipschutz, *On Security*,
GDI-JCR\]

[We have inherited an ontotheology of security, that is, an a priori
argument that proves the existence and necessity of only one form of
security because there currently happens to be a widespread,
metaphysical belief in it.]{.underline} Indeed, [within the concept of
security lurks the entire history of western metaphysics]{.underline},
which was best described by Derrida \"as a series of substitutions of
center for center\" in a perpetual search for the \"transcendental
signified.\"1 From God to Rational Man, from Empire to Republic, from
King to the People\--and on occasion in the reverse direction as well,
for history is never so linear, never so neat as we would write it\--the
security of the center has been the shifting site from which the forces
of authority, order, and identity philosophically defined and physically
kept at bay anarchy, chaos, and difference. Yet the center, as modern
poets and postmodern critics tell us, no longer holds. The demise of a
bipolar system, the diffusion of power into new political, national, and
economic constellations, the decline of civil society and the rise of
the shopping mall, the acceleration of everything \--transportation,
capital and information flows, change itself\--have induced a new
anxiety. As George Bush repeatedly said\--that is, until the 1992
Presidential election went into full swing\--\"The enemy is
unpredictability. The enemy is instability.\"2 One immediate response,
[the unthinking reaction, is to master this anxiety and to resecure the
center by remapping the peripheral threats.]{.underline} In this vein,
the Pentagon prepares seven military scenarios for future conflict,
ranging from latino small-fry to an IdentiKit super-enemy that goes by
the generic acronym of REGT (\"Reemergent Global Threat\"). In the
heartlands of America, Toyota sledge-hammering returns as a popular
know-nothing distraction. And within the Washington beltway, rogue
powers such as North Korea, Iraq, and Libya take on the status of
pariah-state and potential video bomb-site for a permanently
electioneering elite. [There are also prodromal efforts to shore up the
center of the International Relations discipline.]{.underline} In a
newly instituted series in the International Studies Quarterly , the
state of [security studies is surveyed so as to refortify its
borders.]{.underline}3 After acknowledging that \"the boundaries of
intellectual disciplines are permeable,\" the author proceeds not only
to raise the drawbridge but also to caulk every chink in the moat.4
Recent attempts to broaden the concept of \"security\" to include such
issues as global environmental dangers, disease, and economic and
natural disasters endanger the field by threatening \"to destroy its
intellectual coherence and make it more difficult to devise solutions to
any of these important problems.\"5 The field is surveyed in the most
narrow and parochial way: out of 200-plus works cited, esteemed Third
World scholars of strategic studies receive no mention, British and
French scholars receive short shrift, and Soviet writers do not make it
into the Pantheon at all. The author of the essay, Stephen Walt, has
written one of the better books on alliance systems;6 here he seems
intent on constructing a new alliance within the discipline against
\"foreign\" others, with the \"postmodernist\" as arch-alien. The tactic
is familiar: like many of the neoconservatives who have launched the
recent attacks on \"political correctness,\" the \"liberals\" of
international relations make it a habit to base their criticisms on
secondary accounts of a category of thinking rather than on a primary
engagement with the specific (and often differing) views of the thinkers
themselves.7 In this case, Walt cites IR scholar Robert Keohane on the
hazards of \"reflectivism,\" to warn off anyone who by inclination or
error might wander into the foreign camp: \"As Robert Keohane has noted,
until these writers \`have delineated . . . a research program and shown
. . . that it can illuminate important issues in world politics, they
will remain on the margins of the field.\' \"8 By the end of the essay,
one is left with the suspicion that the rapid changes in world politics
have triggered a \"security crisis\" in security studies that requires
extensive theoretical damage control. What [if we leave the desire for
mastery to the insecure and instead imagine a new dialogue of
security]{.underline}, not in the pursuit of a utopian end but in
recognition of the world as it is, other than us ? What might such a
dialogue sound like? [Any attempt at an answer requires a genealogy: to
understand the discursive power of the concept, to remember its
forgotten meanings, to assess its economy of use in the present, to
reinterpret]{.underline}\--and possibly construct through the
reinterpretation\--[a late modern security]{.underline} comfortable with
a plurality of centers, multiple meanings, and fluid identities. The
steps I take here in this direction are tentative and preliminary. I
first undertake a brief history of the concept itself. Second, I present
the \"originary\" form of security that has so dominated our conception
of international relations, the Hobbesian episteme of realism. Third, I
consider the impact of two major challenges to the Hobbesian episteme,
that of Marx and Nietzsche. And finally, I suggest that Baudrillard
provides the best, if most nullifying, analysis of security in late
modernity. In short, [I retell the story of realism as an historic
encounter of fear and danger with power and order that
produced]{.underline} four realist [forms of security: epistemic,
social, interpretive, and hyperreal.]{.underline} To preempt a
predictable criticism, I wish to make it clear that I am not in search
of an \"alternative security.\" An easy defense is to invoke Heidegger,
who declared that \"questioning is the piety of thought.\"9 Foucault,
however, gives the more powerful reason for [a genealogy of
security]{.underline}: I am [not looking for an alternative; you can\'t
find the solution of a problem in the solution of another problem raised
at another moment by other people.]{.underline} You see, what I want to
do is not the history of solutions, and that\'s the reason why [I don\'t
accept the word alternative]{.underline} . My point is not that
everything is bad, but that everything is dangerous, then we always have
something to do.10 [The hope is that in the interpretation of the most
pressing dangers of late modernity we might be able to
construct]{.underline} a form of security based on the appreciation and
articulation rather than the normalization or extirpation of difference.
In traditional realist representations of world politics as the struggle
for power among states, the will to security is born out of a primal
fear, a natural estrangement and a condition of anarchy which diplomacy,
international law and the balance of power seek, yet ultimately fail, to
mediate.11 By considering some historical meanings of security that
exceed this prevailing view, I wish to suggest [\"new\" possibilities
and intelligibilities]{.underline} for security. Admittedly, this brief
genealogy is thin on analysis and thick on description. But my intention
is to provoke discussion, and to suggest that there is more than a
speculative basis for the acceptance of a concept of security that is
less coherent and dogmatic, and more [open to the historical complexity
and contingent nature of international relations.]{.underline}

# Historical Material

#### MacArthur 1950 quotes on Taiwan

**MacArther 50** \[Douglas, Supreme Commander of the Allied powers
during WWII, US Army Chief of staff, leader of the UN Command in the
Korean War, "Texts of Controversial MacArthur Message and Truman's
Formosa Statement," *New York Times*, 8/29/50,
<https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1950/08/29/91634426.html>,
accessed 7/12/19, GDI-JCR\]

Prior \[to the Second World War\] the western strategic frontier of the
United States lay on the littoral line of the Americas with an exposed
island salient extending out through Hawaii, Midway and Guam to the
Philippines. That salient was not an outpost of strength but an avenue
of weakness along which the enemy could and did attack us. *The Pacific
was a potential area of advancement for any predatory force intent upon
striking at the bordering land areas. All of this was changed by our
Pacific victory. Our strategic frontier then shifted to embrace the
entire Pacific Ocean, which has become a vast moat to protect us as long
as we hold it. Indeed, it acts as a protective shield to all of the
Americas and all free lands of the Pacific Ocean area we control.*

*Under such conditions the Pacific no longer represents menacing avenues
of approach for a prospective invader---it assumes instead the friendly
aspect of a peaceful lake*.

The geographic location of Formosa is such that in the hand of a power
unfriendly to the United States it constitutes an enemy salient in the
very center of this defensive perimeter, 100 to 150 miles closer to the
adjacent friendly segments---Okinawa and the Philippines---than any
point in continental Asia.

As a result of its geographic location and base potential, utilization
of Formosa by a military hostile to the United States may either
counter-balance or overshadow the strategic importance of the central
and southern flank of the United States front line position. Formosa in
the hands of such a hostile power could be compared to an *unsinkable
aircraft carrier* and submarine tender ideally located to accomplish
offensive strategy and at the same time checkmate defensive or
counter-offensive operations by friendly forces based on Okinawa and the
Philippines.

Should Formosa fall into the hands of a hostile power, history would
repeat itself. Its military potential would again be fully exploited as
the means to breach and *neutralize our Western Pacific defense system
and mount a war of conquest against the free nations of the Pacific
basin.*

Nothing could be more fallacious than the threadbare argument by those
who advocate appeasement and defeatism in the Pacific that if we defend
Formosa we alienate continental Asia. Those who speak thus do not
understand the Orient. They do not grant that it is *the pattern of the
Oriental psychology to respect and follow aggressive, resolute and
dynamic leadership*---to quickly turn on a leadership characterized by
timidity or vacillation---and they underestimate the Oriental mentality.

*To pursue any other course* would be to turn over the fruits of our
Pacific victory to a potential enemy. It would shift any future battle
area 5000 miles eastward to the coasts of the American continents, our
own home coast; it *would completely expose* our friends in the
Philippines, our friends in Australia and New Zealand, our friends in
Indonesia, our friends in Japan, and other areas, *to the lustful
thrusts of those who stand for slavery against liberty, for atheism as
against God*.

The decision of President Truman on June 27 lighted into flame a lamp of
hope throughout Asia that was burning dimly toward extinction. It marked
for the Far East the focal and turning point in this area's struggle for
freedom. It swept aside in one great monumental stroke all of the
hypocrisy and the sophistry which has confused and deluded so many
people distant from the actual scene.

### 1NC -- Reunification DA

#### ROC depends on US for security -- relationship is strong now but regular and credible reassurances are necessary

**Bush 2018** \[Richard, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution,
"Why assurances matter in U.S.-Taiwan relations," Brookings Institute,

Now, it is a fact of life that even in the best of international
relationships, no commitment is perfect. There are always cobwebs of
doubt. Misunderstandings occur. Communication breaks down. Circumstances
change. Consequently, credibility and confidence---the linked,
reciprocal elements of commitment---weaken. [Sustaining the credibility
of commitments and confidence]{.underline} in them [requires regular
assurance---]{.underline}with a lower-case "a"---[by the party extending
the commitment.]{.underline} [Regular assurances are
particularly]{.underline} common and [necessary when the relationship
between the party extending the commitment and the one receiving it is
asymmetric.]{.underline} But, even in more balanced relationships,
assurance with a lower-case "a" happens all the time. We, in the public,
just do not hear about it. We all understand that [Taiwan is
significantly dependent on the United States for its
security.]{.underline} For sure, it should rely as much as possible on
its own efforts, but it is still dependent on America. That being the
case, [the credibility of the U.S. commitment and the confidence that
the leaders and people of Taiwan place in that commitment is extremely
important. So is the need for regular assurance]{.underline} (lower-case
"a"). We know from history why Taiwan over the long-term may have
less-than-full confidence in American commitments. The fundamental
change in U.S.-China policy begun by Richard Nixon in 1971, completed by
Jimmy Carter in 1979, and elaborated by Ronald Reagan in 1982, is the
key case in point. Conversely, American administrations have often
preferred to state their commitments unambiguously. They wished to
reduce the blank-check problem and had to take the China factor into
account. The result: [U.S. statements of commitment were not always
fully credible in Taiwan's eyes.]{.underline} Regular, mutual assurance
was all the more required. This situation began to change as Taiwan
became a democracy. Washington sincerely welcomed this transformation,
even though U.S. officials had gotten used to the relative
predictability of the late authoritarian period, when Taiwan's
decisionmaking circle was very small and its perceived choices very few.
[Simultaneous with democratization, through the 1990s the PRC's military
threat to Taiwan and the importance for the United States to maintain
the island's security increased.]{.underline} Democratization on Taiwan
greatly widened the range of debated options about the island's future.
In response, first President Lee Teng-hui and then President Chen
Shui-bian took new initiatives on cross-Strait policy. Whatever their
motivation, from the mid-1990s on Beijing came to believe that they each
had the intention to separate Taiwan from the state the international
community calls China. [It accelerated the building of military
capabilities by the PRC to deter the separatism it perceived from
Taiwan, and to punish Taiwan if its deterrence failed.]{.underline} The
United States became increasingly worried about this new dynamic, which
combined Taiwan policy initiatives, PRC assessments of them, and PRC's
coercive responses. Washington realized that it could not take peace for
granted. Correctly or incorrectly, President Clinton and President Bush
came to the conclusion that Taiwan, through its actions, was putting the
U.S. interest in peace and stability at stake. How does this evolution
relate to the question of mutual assurance between the United States and
Taiwan? I would argue that [beginning with the Six Assurances (capital
"A") until the mid-1990s, Taiwan was more the recipient of regular U.S.
assurances (lower-case "a"), and properly so. Those assurances were
relatively credible and inspired Taiwan confidence.]{.underline} But
from the 1990s on, there was a growing need for Taiwan to convey
assurances to the United States, to credibly convince Washington that it
would not create risks for the United States and undermine its interest
in peace and stability. The "Four Noes and One Without" (四不一沒有) in
Chen Shui-bian's May 2000 inaugural address was one effort to convey
such assurance. From about August 2002, however, the credibility of
Chen's assurances and the confidence with which Washington regarded them
declined. I would further argue that [mutual assurance between Taipei
and Washington was effective]{.underline} during the administration of
Ma Ying-jeou and [so far under Tsai Ing-wen.]{.underline} [Not only has
each side believed that the policies of the other conform to its
interests, but also the credibility of commitments and the confidence
with which they are received has been good. That bodes well for a stable
U.S.-Taiwan relationship.]{.underline}

The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) today (May 16, 2019) announced the
results of its latest public opinion survey. [More than 80% of the
people surveyed oppose the numerous threatening military actions
recently conducted by the Mainland]{.underline} authorities near Taiwan
(82%), as well as Beijing\'s refusal to renounce the use force against
Taiwan (82.6%). Nearly 90% oppose mainland China\'s obstruction of
Taiwan\'s participation in the World Health Assembly, which denied the
health rights and interests of the Taiwanese people (87.7%). [The
mainstream also opposes Mainland China\'s \"one country, two systems\"
formula (83.6%). The survey findings further showed that **nearly 80% of
the public support the government\'s commitment to safeguarding national
sovereignty and Taiwan\'s free and democratic system**]{.underline}
(78.5%). Nearly 90% firmly believe that Taiwan\'s future and the
development of cross-Strait relations must be decided by the 23 million
people of Taiwan (89.3%), [reflecting broad public support in Taiwan for
the government\'s position on defending Taiwan. The MAC emphasized that
the Republic of China is a sovereign state.]{.underline} Mainland
China\'s \"one country, two systems\" is to eliminate the sovereignty of
the Republic of China. The people of Taiwan will never accept this. The
survey showed that [more than 80% of the public oppose Beijing\'s united
front work to infiltrate, win over, and divide Taiwan]{.underline}
(82.2%). [More than 70% of the public support the government\'s
initiatives to]{.underline} amend laws and regulations in order to
**[strengthen management mechanisms aimed at countering mainland
China\'s \"one country, two systems model for Taiwan\" and safeguarding
national security based on President Tsai Ing-wen\'s \"seven
guidelines\"]{.underline}** (72.8%). [A similar percentage of the public
approve]{.underline} the government\'s completion of draft amendments to
[national security laws and continuous efforts to]{.underline} amend the
Act Governing Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area in conjunction with other laws, which [fortify the
\"security network for democracy\"]{.underline} (75%). Similar support
was found for the government\'s actions to establish a high threshold
democratic oversight mechanism involving congressional review and public
referendums for cross-Strait negotiations on political issues (68.1%)
and promptly complete mechanisms to counter Mainland China\'s
infiltration and united front work (69.6%). The survey results also
found that more than 80% of the public oppose mainland China\'s repeated

intimidation and saber rattling during the election period (81.2%).
**[Over 70% of the public approve the government\'s position of seeking

the survey results showed that the majority of the public, regardless of
party-leaning, oppose the negative actions imposed by the Mainland China
upon Taiwan, while supporting the government\'s firm policy position.
The MAC indicated that the mainland China has seriously undermined the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait by accelerating promotion of
cross-Strait unification and expanding its united front work to
intimidate, pressure, and divide Taiwan. **[The people of Taiwan should

Once again, we sternly warned the other side to not miscalculate public
opinion in Taiwan nor misjudge the situation. The only way to support a
benign development of cross-Strait relations is to stop malicious
provocations against Taiwan.

#### We should listen to the people of Taiwan when formulating policy and action about them

# Liberation theologists suggest that God is on the side of the oppressed. A more modest claim is made here: [those on the bottom know how bad life is]{.underline} without the substantive and intangible goods the philosophers ponder. An expanded consciousness of the actual experience of racism is a method of theoretical inquiry available to CLS scholars in responding to the problem of normative priority.15' This method will generate new theories of justice provable in the only sense available: through intuition, guided by reason, tested against the lives of real people---a formula that is familiar to twentieth century philosophers. The method suggested here merely factors a wider experience into the equation. [The normative intuitions of those on the bottom are often different from the intuitions of those on top.]{.underline} Japanese-Americans interned during World War H report the kindnesses they received from black porters as they made the difficult journey to their exile in the deserts.'52 In considering the humane acts of these black porters, one can hypothesize that the internment, now recognized as one of the great failures of American constitutionalism, could never have occurred if black military officers, politicians and judges had been• included in the process of decision.' 53 It was black soldiers who objected to anti-Japanese racial slurs that were used by the U.S. Army in the Pacific theatre,'54 Black Americans, because of their experiences, are quick to detect racism, to distrust official claims of necessity and to sense a threat to freedom. These intuitions generated from the bottom are useful in making normative choices. A minority perspective cuts across class lines. Reading the editorials and letters in Black Enterprise, a slick and conventional magazine directed at an audience of black entrepreneurs, reveals that even economically successful black capitalists are critical of the Reagan Administration's effect on the poor)55 There is something about color that doesn't wash off as easily as class. The experience of racism, it seems, causes the normative choices of black capitalists to diverge from the choices of others in their class. [To the question "How can one know that a rule or principle is just?" the]{.underline} CLS [scholar could reply, "Ask someone who has suffered and fought against oppression, study their experience, and understand their world vision. They will help you find the right answer." Those on the bottom who speak out against the odds for their vision of justice, often become powerful people in the popular mind.]{.underline} The critical scholar can invoke Sojourner Truth, as she silenced a hostile crowd with the power of her slave experience; Cesar Chavez, as he fasted for the forgotten farm workers; Minoru Yasui, who like Homer Plessy before him, orchestrated his own arrest to bring to the highest court in the land a case that revealed the poverty of the American legal system;'56 and Rosa Parks, who dared to imagine that a black woman could remain seated on a Montgomery bus while a white man stood.157 CLS adherents, by joining these crusaders, can derive the authority to say, "We are on their side, we are right and we will prevail." Alliance with the bottom lends moral force to the project of critical scholarship and helps complete the utopian vision. {#liberation-theologists-suggest-that-god-is-on-the-side-of-the-oppressed.-a-more-modest-claim-is-made-here-those-on-the-bottom-know-how-bad-life-is-without-the-substantive-and-intangible-goods-the-philosophers-ponder.-an-expanded-consciousness-of-the-actual-experience-of-racism-is-a-method-of-theoretical-inquiry-available-to-cls-scholars-in-responding-to-the-problem-of-normative-priority.15-this-method-will-generate-new-theories-of-justice-provable-in-the-only-sense-available-through-intuition-guided-by-reason-tested-against-the-lives-of-real-peoplea-formula-that-is-familiar-to-twentieth-century-philosophers.-the-method-suggested-here-merely-factors-a-wider-experience-into-the-equation.-the-normative-intuitions-of-those-on-the-bottom-are-often-different-from-the-intuitions-of-those-on-top.-japanese-americans-interned-during-world-war-h-report-the-kindnesses-they-received-from-black-porters-as-they-made-the-difficult-journey-to-their-exile-in-the-deserts.52-in-considering-the-humane-acts-of-these-black-porters-one-can-hypothesize-that-the-internment-now-recognized-as-one-of-the-great-failures-of-american-constitutionalism-could-never-have-occurred-if-black-military-officers-politicians-and-judges-had-been-included-in-the-process-of-decision.-53-it-was-black-soldiers-who-objected-to-anti-japanese-racial-slurs-that-were-used-by-the-u.s.-army-in-the-pacific-theatre54-black-americans-because-of-their-experiences-are-quick-to-detect-racism-to-distrust-official-claims-of-necessity-and-to-sense-a-threat-to-freedom.-these-intuitions-generated-from-the-bottom-are-useful-in-making-normative-choices.-a-minority-perspective-cuts-across-class-lines.-reading-the-editorials-and-letters-in-black-enterprise-a-slick-and-conventional-magazine-directed-at-an-audience-of-black-entrepreneurs-reveals-that-even-economically-successful-black-capitalists-are-critical-of-the-reagan-administrations-effect-on-the-poor55-there-is-something-about-color-that-doesnt-wash-off-as-easily-as-class.-the-experience-of-racism-it-seems-causes-the-normative-choices-of-black-capitalists-to-diverge-from-the-choices-of-others-in-their-class.-to-the-question-how-can-one-know-that-a-rule-or-principle-is-just-the-cls-scholar-could-reply-ask-someone-who-has-suffered-and-fought-against-oppression-study-their-experience-and-understand-their-world-vision.-they-will-help-you-find-the-right-answer.-those-on-the-bottom-who-speak-out-against-the-odds-for-their-vision-of-justice-often-become-powerful-people-in-the-popular-mind.-the-critical-scholar-can-invoke-sojourner-truth-as-she-silenced-a-hostile-crowd-with-the-power-of-her-slave-experience-cesar-chavez-as-he-fasted-for-the-forgotten-farm-workers-minoru-yasui-who-like-homer-plessy-before-him-orchestrated-his-own-arrest-to-bring-to-the-highest-court-in-the-land-a-case-that-revealed-the-poverty-of-the-american-legal-system56-and-rosa-parks-who-dared-to-imagine-that-a-black-woman-could-remain-seated-on-a-montgomery-bus-while-a-white-man-stood.157-cls-adherents-by-joining-these-crusaders-can-derive-the-authority-to-say-we-are-on-their-side-we-are-right-and-we-will-prevail.-alliance-with-the-bottom-lends-moral-force-to-the-project-of-critical-scholarship-and-helps-complete-the-utopian-vision. .Card}

#### The affirmative's critique reifies dominant ideology by focusing on the security discourses of those in power -- instead we must attend to the demands for security from the margin

**McDonald 2008** \[Matt, Assoc Prof of Political Science and
International Studies at the Univ of Queensland, "Securitisation and the
Construction of Security," *European Journal of International Relations*

<https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37144031_Securitization_and_the_Construction_of_Security>,
accessed 7/11/19, GDI-JCR\]

Those interested in the construction of security in contemporary
international politics - the process through which 'security' and
'security threats' are brought into being in particular political
contexts- have increasingly turned to the Copenhagen School approach to
provide an analytical framework for their analyses. Most prominently, of
course, has been the use of [the central organising concept of
'securitisation']{.underline} to point to the discursive construction of
particular issues as security threats.1 This conceptual framework has
been variously applied to issues such as immigration, health, political
dissidence and minority rights, particularly in the context of the
post-2001 US-led 'war on terror'. This article argues that while an
important and innovative contribution to our understanding of security
and its construction, the securitisation framework [is problematically
narrow]{.underline} in three basic senses. First, the form of act
constructing security is defined narrowly, with **[the focus on the
speech of dominant actors, usually political leaders]{.underline}**.
This **[excludes a focus on other forms of representation]{.underline}**
(images or material practices, for example), **[and also encourages a
focus only on the discursive interventions of those voices deemed
institutionally legitimate]{.underline}** to speak on behalf of a
particular collective, usually a state. Second, the context of the act
is defined narrowly, with the focus only on the moment of intervention.
The potential for security to be constructed over time through a range
of incremental processes and representations is not addressed here, and
the question of why particular representations resonate with relevant
constituencies is under-theorised in this framework.2 Finally, and
perhaps most fundamentally, the framework of securitisation is narrow in
the sense that the nature of the act is defined solely in terms of the
designation of threats to security. [This focus ignores the central
importance of the way in which security (as a normative goal or
expression of core values) is understood in particular
contexts.]{.underline} It also suggests that security acquires content
only through representations of danger and threat. Such a framework
encourages a conceptualisation of security politics as inherently
negative and reactionary. A range of scholarship has highlighted a
number of these problems in various forms. 3 But outlining the narrow
scope of the Copenhagen School's securitisation framework here regarding
the broader construction of security is important analytically and
normatively. The article develops three forms of critique with different
objectives, linked to specific dimensions of narrowness. The first
concerns issues or dynamics mentioned but underspecified in the
securitisation framework, most prominently the context of the speech
act. Here, I suggest that dynamics such as the role of 'facilitating
conditions' and the 'audience' are so under-theorised as to ultimately
remain outside the framework itself, and would benefit from being both
brought in and drawn out. The point of outlining this form of narrowness
is therefore to suggest the need to better integrate (where possible)
various dimensions of the construction of security recognised as
important within the Copenhagen School literature so as to strengthen
the framework itself. The second problematic dimension of narrowness
addressed here are questions and dynamics neglected within the framework
itself, including most prominently the questions of why particular
representations of threat resonate with particular communities, and how
particular actors are either empowered or marginalised in 'speaking'
security. The goal here is twofold. First and most importantly, it is to
suggest that the securitisation framework should not be viewed as
shorthand for the broader construction of security. Second, it is to
raise questions about whether the framework itself captures the most
important dynamics of that which it is trying to explain. While the
above analytical issues are clearly important, perhaps more important is
the third problematic dimension of narrowness: points where the narrow
nature of the framework has problematic normative implications. Here, I
focus on the role of the framework in **[reifying both dominant voices
and traditional security discourses]{.underline}** that fit most
squarely within the Copenhagen School's logic of security. The goal here
is to point to some of these implications and suggest that those working
within this tradition need to be reflective about these implications and
their potential contribution to leaving power 'where it is' in security
terms. I conclude the article by suggesting what a broader approach to
the construction of security might look like and what role the
securitisation framework might play in this approach. [Those interested
in the construction of security]{.underline}, I would argue, [would do
well to]{.underline} focus on understanding the processes through which
particular definintions or discourses of security come to constitute the
lens through which specific issues are conceptualised and addressed by
different political communities. Employing this focus necessarily
entails a [move beyond the depiction through speech of issues as
existential threats to those communities]{.underline}, although there
would still be an important role for this form of analysis. [**A broader
approach to the construction of security also entails a focus on how
political communities** themselves are constituted]{.underline} (beyond
the designation of threat), [how particular articulations of security
come to capture the way that community **deals with those issues**, and
potentially locating and **acknowledging alternative articulations of
security, especially those outlined by marginalised
voices.**]{.underline}

### Taiwan Needs US Support

#### Taiwan can fend off China and win the defensive war -- just needs to have the proper weapons 

**Greer** **2018** \[Tanner, writer and analyst formerly based out of
Beijing, "Taiwan Can Win a War With China." Foreign Policy, 9/25/18,

Accessed 7/1/19, GDI -- JMoore\]

This sketch makes sense of the anxiety [the PLA officer
manuals]{.underline} express. They [know war would be a terrific
gamble]{.underline}, even if they only admit it to each other. Yet [it
this also makes sense of the party's violent reactions to even the
smallest of arms sales to Taiwan.]{.underline} Their passion betrays
their angst. [They understand what Western gloom-and-doomsters do not.
American analysts use terms like "mature precision-strike regime" and
"anti-access and area denial warfare" to describe technological trends
that make it extremely difficult to project naval and airpower near
enemy shores.]{.underline} Costs favor the defense: It is much cheaper
to build a ship-killing missile than it is to build a ship. [But if this
means that the Chinese army can counter U.S. force projection at a
fraction of America's costs, it also means that the democracies
straddling the East Asian rim can deter Chinese aggression at a fraction
of the PLA's costs.]{.underline} [In an era that favors defense, small
nations like Taiwan do not need a PLA-sized military budget to keep the
Chinese at bay.]{.underline} No one needs to hear this message more than
the Taiwanese themselves. In my trips to Taiwan, I have made a point of
tracking down and interviewing both conscripts and career soldiers.
Their pessimism is palpable. This morale crisis in the ranks partly
reflects the severe mismanagement of the conscription system, which has
left even eager Taiwanese patriots disillusioned with their military
experience. But just as important is the lack of knowledge ordinary
Taiwanese have about the strength of their islands' defenses. A recent
poll found that 65 percent of Taiwanese "have no confidence" in their
military's ability to hold off the PLA. Absent a vigorous campaign
designed to educate the public about the true odds of successful
military resistance, the Taiwanese people are likely to judge the
security of their island on flawed metrics, like the diminishing number
of countries that maintain formal relations with Taipei instead of
Beijing. The PLA's projected campaign is specifically designed to
overwhelm and overawe a demoralized Taiwanese military. The most crucial
battlefield may be the minds of the Taiwanese themselves. Defeatism is a
more dangerous threat to Taiwanese democracy than any weapon in China's
armory. BotBoth Westerners and Taiwanese should be more optimistic about
the defense of Taiwan than is now normal. Yes, [the Taiwanese Army
projects that it can only hold off its enemy for two weeks after the
landing---but the PLA also believes that if it cannot defeat the
Taiwanese forces in under two weeks, it will lose the war!]{.underline}
Yes, [the disparity between the military budgets on both sides of the
strait is large, and growing---but the Taiwanese do not need parity to
deter Chinese aggression. All they need is the freedom to purchase the
sort of arms that make invasion unthinkable.]{.underline} If that
political battle can be resolved in the halls of Washington, [the party
will not have the power to threaten battle on the shores of
Taiwan.]{.underline}

aperture radar integration techniques and advanced target recognition.

#### Taiwan supports strong US military presence in the Pacific as being key to their safety

[Taiwanese-Americans believe that a strong US is a guarantor of
stability and freedom in the Western Pacific rim,]{.underline} and that
a strong US-Taiwan partnership is essential to the US' success as a
Pacific power. We anticipate that the summit between Trump and Chinese
President Xi Jinping (習近平) in Florida presents both opportunities and
risks for the US, and ask Trump to keep the following in mind during his
sessions with Xi. First, China's default negotiating posture is: "What
is mine is mine; what is yours is negotiable." China's goal is to
supersede the US as the global hegemon and expand its sphere of
influence at the cost of US interests and core values. Xi will exert
heavy pressure to get Trump to abandon seven decades of US policy toward
Taiwan and explicitly concede that "Taiwan is part of China." However,
the core of the US' Taiwan policy is enshrined in US law: The 1979
Taiwan Relations Act and then-US president Ronald Reagan's 1982 "six
assurances." These have been embraced by previous US administrations and
both steadfastly rebuff China's assertions of "sovereignty" over Taiwan.
These policies are not negotiable; not only from the perspective of
Taiwanese, but also of US interests in the region, namely maintaining
the stability of US trade, security and alliances. Second, the Three
Communiques --- the 1972 Shanghai Communique between former US president
Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong (毛澤東), the 1978 Normalization Communique
and the 1982 Third Communique --- are all predicated on China's pledge
to resolve peacefully all regional disputes, especially disputes with
Taiwan. These communiques are rendered void by China's ratcheting
threats of force in the Taiwan Strait, and the South and East China
seas, which endanger freedom of navigation, commerce, and US security
interests. Third, Washington is the demanding party in bilateral
US-China economic and financial negotiations, not Beijing. In the past
30 years, China has gotten everything it has asked for, and then some,
without giving up anything in return. It is time that US demands were
met as repayment for decades of acquiescence and that China fulfill past
promises. Fourth, [the US remains the preeminent power in the
Pacific]{.underline}, despite China's military and economic expansion.
US partners in the Pacific remain force multipliers when confronting
China's challenges. [The US' alliances and partnerships in the Pacific,
including its strong partnership with Taiwan, are essential]{.underline}
to maintaining the leverage needed to confront Chinese misbehavior.
[What is needed in the Pacific is US strategic leadership.]{.underline}
Fifth, for decades, China's objective has been to eclipse the US. China
has no interest in "making America great again." On the contrary, China
seeks to weaken the US and its values and interests. China's leaders are
masters at diverting attention with short-term, made-up distractions.
For example, China has perpetuated the crisis with North Korea for the
purpose of convincing successive Washington administrations that Beijing
must be appeased if China is to cooperate. Yet China's "cooperation" has
resulted in five North Korean nuclear detonations --- two last year
alone. It has also resulted in numerous North Korean missile tests,
including missile trajectories that place the US in range.
[Taiwanese-Americans believe that a strong US Taiwan partnership, in the
context of robust US leadership in the Western Pacific]{.underline},
will keep America first in the Pacific. That [is essential]{.underline}
to maintaining US leadership in a world that is increasingly dominated
by Chinese mercantilism and strategic intimidation. [A reaffirmation of
that partnership would also send a welcome message to the US' friends
and allies around the world.]{.underline}

### Aff Silences Taiwan

#### The Aff's focus on dominant discourses of security actively silences the voices of the Taiwanese people who understand their security not as domination but as a means of emancipation

International Studies at the Univ of Queensland, "Securitisation and the

To date I have focused on the 'narrowness' of the securitisation
framework in analytical terms, suggesting the possibility for
strengthening the framework by drawing out important elements of context
and different forms of representation, for example, while also pointing
to the limits and tensions within the framework that might make this
difficult. I have also suggested in these contexts that it is important
to avoid viewing the framework as short-hand for the broader
construction of security. The question of which actors' representations
are viewed as significant within this framework, however, entails
important normative commitments and has important normative
implications. Put simply, [the securitisation framework focuses
on]{.underline} articulations capable of leading to change in practice,
with the default position being a focus on [the 'securitisations' of
political leaders]{.underline} who are able to achieve a wide audience
in their statements and interventions, and who are able to marshal the
resources of the state to respond to the existential threat. As Wæver
(1995:57) argues, 'security is articulated only from a specific place,
in an institutional voice, by elites'. [Such a focus serves to
marginalise the experiences and articulations of the powerless in global
politics, presenting them at best as part of an audience that can
collectively consent to or contest securitising moves, and at worst as
passive recipients of elite discourses.]{.underline} In perhaps the
clearest statement of this limitation, Lene Hansen (2000) has discussed
the ways in which the focus on speech acts means contributing to the
silencing of women, whose suffering and engagement with security
discourses is neglected in a framework that focuses on the articulations
of the powerful: of those whose voices can be heard and of those whose
successful attempts at securitisation can result in the enactment of
emergency measures. [Such a framework clearly has little to say about
the plight of the most vulnerable in global politics and their
experiences of- and engagement with- security and threat.]{.underline}
Indeed for Hansen, the Copenhagen School does not simply neglect the
experiences of women but in fact serves to further marginalise them. 'If
security is a speech act', Hansen (2000:306) suggests, 'then it is
simultaneously deeply implicated in the production of silence'. In many
ways this focus on dominant voices in the construction of security is
not a problem for the Copenhagen School alone. Traditional security
proponents and some [post-structuralists limit the number of actors
deemed important in security terms in focusing on either state policy or
dominant discourses.]{.underline} While Copenhagen School proponents
allow the possibility for security actors and 'securitisers' other that
state political leaders (Buzan et al. 1998:31-3), this move is
ultimately closed off by the dual suggestions that security is
ultimately about states (eg Wæver 1989:314; Wæver 1995:47-9); and that
security is articulated from a position of institutional power (Wæver
1995:57; Buzan et al. 1998:32-3). The default position here is therefore
a focus on the political leaders of states and their designations of
threat. The methodological focus on speech acts might also be seen as
relevant to this bias. As Jennifer Milliken (1999:243-5) has argued,
[the tendency to ignore subjugated knowledge or voices is a general
inclination within discourse analytical approaches to international
relations.]{.underline} In short, [the focus only on dominant voices and
their designation of security and threat is normatively problematic,
contributing to the silencing of marginal voices and ignoring the ways
in which such actors have attempted precisely to contest these security
constructions.]{.underline} But it also has problematic implications
analytically. First, and echoing criticisms noted above, [it pays
insufficient attention to the means through which particular
articulations of security and threat become possible]{.underline}: how,
for example, are marginal actors and their articulations of security
silenced or marginalised? Focusing on these marginalised or subjugated
actors could point to some of the ways in which 'securitisation' becomes
possible, expanding the emphasis on 'contexts' noted in the previous
section. Second, it arguably encourages the particular logic of security
which the Copenhagen School embraces. [**A range of (often marginal)
actors contest dominant logics or discourses of security and threat
through articulating alternative (even emancipatory) discourses of
security and threat rather than simply arguing for
'desecuritisation'**.]{.underline} Amnesty International's campaign on
human rights violations against Kurdish populations in Turkey in the
1990s, for example, particularly questioned the justification of these
violations on the grounds of 'security'. This was reflected in the title
of its publication, Turkey: No Security Without Human Rights. [For such
actors, security]{.underline} (defined in non-statist, non-exclusionary
and non-militaristic ways) [can be a means for- or site of- emancipatory
change.]{.underline} For the so-called Welsh School of critical security
studies, [focusing on the marginalised and 'voiceless']{.underline} (Wyn
Jones 1999:159) [points to the ways in which potentially exclusionary,
statist and militaristic security discourses can be challenged and
replaced without simply giving up on security as a political
category.]{.underline} Here, it could be argued that [the
choice]{.underline} within the Copenhagen School [to ultimately limit
attention to powerful actors and voices blinds its proponents to the
role of security as a site of competing discourses or images of
politics, and even potentially as a site for emancipation.]{.underline}
Narrowness in this context has important normative implications that
those using the framework would do well to reflect upon.

On Wednesday, June 20, United States Congressman Dana Rohrabacher
(R-CA), introduced a resolution (HCR124) in the U.S. House of
Representatives, calling on the United States government to resume
diplomatic relations with Taiwan and to abolish the U.S. One China
Policy. Rep. Rohrabacher is a longtime supporter of Taiwan and a
founding co-chairman of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus. The resolution
concludes that: "(1) [the President should abandon the fundamentally
flawed ''One China Policy'' in favor of a more realistic ''One China,
One Taiwan Policy'' that recognizes Taiwan as a sovereign and
independent country]{.underline}, separate from the Communist regime in
China; (2) the President should begin the process of resuming normal
diplomatic relations with Taiwan; (3) the President, the Permanent
Representative of the United States to the United Nations, and other
relevant [United States officials should aggressively support Taiwan's
full participation in the United Nations and any other international
organization of which the United States is a member, and for which
statehood is a requirement for membership."]{.underline} Of the five
countries in the world that the United States government currently does
not diplomatically recognize (Syria, Iran, North Korea, Bhutan and
Taiwan), Taiwan is the only full-fledged democracy. Similar resolutions
were introduced in 2005 by former Congressman Tom Tancredo (R-CO), on
2007 and in 2009 by former Congressman John Linder (R-GA), and in 2012
and 2013 by Rep. Michael McCaul (R-TX). Furthermore, the resolution
affirms that the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances form the
cornerstone of United States-Taiwan relations and establishes ["the
reality that Taiwan has functioned as an independent and sovereign
country for over half a century."]{.underline} In a Commentary piece in
the Wall Street Journal of January 17, 2016, current National Security
Adviser John Bolton wrote: "The new U.S. administration could start with
receiving Taiwanese diplomats officially at the State Department;
upgrading the status of U.S. representation in Taipei from a private
"institute" to an official diplomatic mission; inviting Taiwan's
president to travel officially to America; allowing the most senior U.S.
officials to visit Taiwan to transact government business; and
ultimately restoring full diplomatic recognition." FAPA President Mike
Kuo states: "[The Taiwanese people brought about their momentous
transition to democracy some thirty years ago, but US policy did not
adapt to that new reality. By normalizing relations with Taiwan, the
United States would set a shining example for other countries to
emulate."]{.underline} Dr. Kuo concludes: "The resolution also reflects
the growing sense within the U.S. Congress that [the United States "One
China Policy" is more and more untenable, as it is out of touch with the
unmistakable reality that Taiwan is a free and democratic nation that
deserves to be accepted as a full and equal member in the international
community.]{.underline} The time is now to move towards a more realistic
and practical 'One China, One Taiwan' policy."

#### Taiwan is on the brink of losing all diplomatic ties -- US recognition is key to its survival

[Taiwan now has 18 diplomatic allies left.]{.underline} Seventeen are
developing nations in the South Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the
Caribbean: Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, the Solomon
Islands, Tuvalu, Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Paraguay, Eswatini, Haiti, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint
Vincent. [Only one of them is in Europe]{.underline}: The Holy See,
whose territorial residence is the Vatican. The tiny city-state has an
area of 44 hectares and a population of about 1,000. It is the smallest
state in the world by area and population. The Holy See is also the only
country in Europe that does not have diplomatic relations with China.
[To help Taiwan get off the slippery slope it is on when it comes to
losing its diplomatic allies to China]{.underline}, the Holy See can and
must play a crucial role. The Republic of China (ROC) established
official diplomatic relations with the Holy See in 1942, during World
War II. Their diplomatic relationship continued after the ROC fled to
Taiwan in 1949 after the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) lost the
Chinese Civil War. However, since 1987, Beijing and the Holy See have
held 30 rounds of talks to establish relations. Over the past several
years, Beijing and the Vatican have genuinely began to cozy up,
discussing the establishment of formal diplomatic relations. However,
last month it became clear that due to multiple points of friction, such
as the appointment of bishops and the Holy See's doubts that China would
keep the promises it has made, an agreement solving the nearly 70-year
rift is not expected any time soon. "There is no imminent signature of
an agreement between the Holy See and the People's Republic of China," a
Vatican spokesman said early last month. This presents a window of
opportunity for Taiwan. In a September 2016 letter, the Formosan
Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) called on Vice President Chen
Chien-jen (陳建仁), who was about to embark on a trip to Rome and meet
with Pope Francis, to urge the pope to move toward "dual recognition"
(also known as "separate recognition") of Taiwan and China. Such dual
diplomatic recognition by the Holy See of Taipei and Beijing would
entail embracing Chinese Catholics and not abandoning the 23 million
Taiwanese, and would be a way to foster and encourage peaceful
coexistence and mutual respect between Taiwan and China. In addition, it
would set a precedent for other nations to emulate. At the time, the
pope had played a critical role in initiating US-Cuba diplomatic
relations. So it makes sense that the pope take the lead in officially
recognizing that Taiwan and China are two nations on either side of the
Taiwan Strait, which the international community wants to see develop
into friendly neighbors. For Taiwan to lose the Vatican as its
diplomatic ally could set the nation further and faster on the road it
is on. Having the Vatican establish diplomatic relations with both
Taiwan and China would stop Taiwan from continuing on this trajectory.
[The US can]{.underline} also [play a role]{.underline} in this process.
Over the past two decades, [several members of the US House of
Representatives have repeatedly introduced legislation calling for the
resumption of diplomatic relations with Taiwan.]{.underline} They were
motivated by indignation over the fact that the US has diplomatic
relations with every nation around the world except four: North Korea,
Iran, Bhutan and Taiwan. The US representatives felt, and still feel,
that Taiwan does not belong in that little band of rogue nations ---
they are right, of course. We at FAPA therefore urge Chen again to use
his good offices and call upon the pope to move toward "dual
recognition." [It is an idea that is long overdue --- it is now or
never.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Praxis DA

#### Critical theory fails the current political moment -- focusing on understanding structures of oppression without concrete strategies of dissent and change replicate the failure of critical theory without praxis

Another central insight of critical theory is that these [struggles are
fought, and often won,]{.underline} on the basis of illusions: [by
getting people to believe so deeply in the truth of social facts that
they are then willing to sacrifice their lives for their
beliefs]{.underline}. In recent decades, with the collapse of communism
and the rise of neoliberalism, the illusion of free markets has done
most of the work. But today, increasingly, the specter of immigrant
invasion, of loss of white identity, and of the Islamification of the
West are now converting many more people to extreme-right populist
movements.¶ [In times past, critical theory would have had a ready-made
answer to these troubled times]{.underline}. In the late nineteenth and
most of the twentieth centuries, [Marxist thinkers dominated the
critical Left. Traditional critical theory was tethered to class
struggle and historical materialism]{.underline}. **[Critical
practice---what became known as praxis---was oriented toward
revolution]{.underline}**. To be sure, there were internecine conflicts
and rivalries over tactics. The heated debate between Rosa Luxembourg
and Lenin on the question of what was to be done is a good
illustration.1 But the broad outline of the path forward was well
defined: class struggle, international solidarity, and revolutionary
social transformation. This vision of praxis shaped the first generation
of the Frankfurt School and represented a common horizon for the
critical Left in the early to mid-twentieth century.¶ [But with peasant
and anti-colonial insurrections in the East and South at mid-century,
and in the wake of the repression following May 1968, many critical
voices began to fracture the consensus of traditional critical
theory]{.underline}. The decline of syndicalism and of more radical
factions of the international labor movement gradually transformed and
pacified labor movements during the second half of the twentieth century
The events in the 1950s and 60s, especially in Hungary and the East
Bloc, began to unveil some of the illusions of traditional critical
theory itself; as did the streets of 1968 where the vitality of the
student and worker movements slammed against the rigidity of leftist
parties, especially Western communist parties still beholden to the
Soviet Union. At that point, the grip of Marx's philosophy of history
began to loosen. And [once that glue dissolved, the critical
prescriptions got muddied]{.underline}. Since that time, [critical
praxis has lacked its earlier coherence]{.underline}---leaving many
[critical thinkers today somewhat disarmed in the face of renewed
right-wing populism.¶]{.underline} **[There is today no longer an
intelligible critical response to the question "What is to be
done?"]{.underline}** Apart from a dwindling core, few critical
theorists would explicitly advocate the answers that most on the
critical Left would have imagined in the early or mid-twentieth century.
Today, right-wing populist movements have cannibalized segments of the
proletarian base of the former Left, turning old-style class warfare
into anti-immigrant, xenophobic, and ethno-racist conflict. The cleavage
is no longer between the workers and the bourgeoisie, but between a
populist white class versus minorities and immigrants, or children of
immigrants, predominantly of color. In the United States, it is between
destitute whites and impoverished blacks and Latinos. [The problems this
raises are acute]{.underline}.¶ The questions are pressing---but
**[critical theory no longer provides a straightforward
answer]{.underline}**. To the contrary, in recent decades, [critical
theory has been mired in internecine struggles of influence among its
different branches]{.underline}---Marxist, Lacanian, Foucaultian,
deconstructive, feminist, post-colonial, queer---or worse, in tribal
politics and gossip around its illuminati. These [internal wars of
influence and political games have prevented critics from building on
the core of critique and taking on the challenge of elaborating a
contemporary critical theory of practice---a critical praxis for our
critical times]{.underline}.¶ It is time, then, to rejuvenate critical
theory and critical praxis for the twenty-first century. In these pages,
I will set forth a new vision for critical theory and praxis, and answer
the specific question of what is to be done today, here, and now. In
brief, I will propose that we understand critical theory, at its core,
as a pure theory of illusions that calls for a pure theory of values and
entails a pure theory of tactics. Let me prefigure the argument as
succinctly as possible.¶ [Critical theory is the constant endless
unveiling of illusions in order to demonstrate the distributional
consequences of our belief systems, material conditions, and political
economies. It traces the effects in reality of our beliefs and material
practice]{.underline}s, recognizing that, as it unveils illusions, it
creates new ones that will need to be unpacked next. [It is relentless
in this way---this is its anti-foundational basis. It engages in a form
of recursive unmasking---an infinite regress]{.underline}---that
endlessly exposes the distributional effects of belief systems and
material conditions. It entails, in this sense, a pure theory of
illusions.¶ In the same way in which reconstructed critical theory,
understood as a pure theory of illusions, liberates us from unfounded
positivist foundations, it also frees us from the foundational
constraints of traditional critical utopias. **[There is no unique form
of political economy that will satisfy a critical utopian
vision.]{.underline}** All political economic regimes are regulated in
unique ways and produce material distributions that are the direct
effect of the specific rules and regulations of that particular regime,
not of the abstract regime type. A state-controlled economy can
distribute to its apparatschik, just as a privately-owned corporation
can distribute to its workers: it is not the type, but the detailed
mechanisms and regulations of the specific regime that shape the social
order. All that we can judge, as critical theorists, is how close a
specific regime approximates the values and ideals that the critical
tradition shares. In this sense, critical theory calls for judgment
about the values that a political economic regime instantiates through
its material outcomes and distributions, not for a particular political
economy. Hand-in-hand with a pure theory of illusions, [reconstructed
critical theory must be agnostic about the form of political economic
regime, but adamant about its values]{.underline}. It entails, in this
sense, a pure theory of values.¶ [In terms of praxis, then,
reconstructed critical theory calls for entirely situated,
contextualized analyses of how to push specific, really-existing,
situated political economic regimes]{.underline}---whether capitalist,
socialist, or communist---in the proper direction. Each historical,
temporal, and geopolitical situation will differ, calling for different
tactics---with nothing off the table. This is an inherently combative
enterprise because critical theorists are necessarily opposing and
confronting the values and material projects of others**[. Politics is a
constant battle over values, and we are all inevitably in a state of
competition to realize our ideals. In such a contested space, it is only
possible to develop tactics in a situated and contextualized way. Since
there is no war to be won, but an endless series of battles, critical
theory must focus on tactics]{.underline}**. These are not portable or
generalizable. What might have been appropriate in 1930s Germany was
completely different than what worked in 1940s India. In the latter
context, non-violent resistance may have been appropriate; in the former
it would have been useless. Battle tactics cannot be universalized. In
this sense, reconstructed critical theory calls for a pure theory of
tactics.¶ The upshot is that there is no single or abstract answer to
the question "What is to be done?" In the same way in which
reconstructed critical theory overcomes unfounded positivist
foundations, the question "What is to be done?" does not have a unique
or correct answer in the abstract. The answer is not a vanguard party, a
leaderless movement, non-violent resistance, or any general mode of
uprising, in the abstract. There is no one right way to proceed in
general terms. We immediately go off track when we seek one
generalizable answer to the question. Instead, the question must be
answered differently for each situation, specified and contextualized in
space and time. There must be a GPS-, time-, and date-stamp to every
answer.¶ In this book, I propose one such time, place, and date stamped
answer to the question: "What is to be done in the United States on
September 1, 2018?" That is the only style of question that is worth a
critical response. I hope that others will answer the question with
their own time, place, and date stamp wherever they are now---and I will
facilitate a forum to post those answers. **[Critical theory cannot
simply understand our crises and unveil our illusions. It cannot content
itself with reflection or contemplation as a form of practice. It must
articulate tactics and praxis]{.underline}**.¶ [Critical times call for
radical revaluation. Earlier similar epochs were foundational moments
for critical theory and praxis]{.underline}. The 1920s, especially in
the Weimar Republic, gave rise to a whole generation of critical
theorists---many of whom would emigrate in exile around the world and
spawn a critical diaspora.2 The 1960s, with its global student uprisings
and government repression, stimulated another wave of critical theory
and praxis, giving way to a formidable decade of critical thought during
the 1970s. [Our critical times today demand an equal response from
contemporary critical theorists. That is what I propose here: a new
vision for critical theory and critical praxis for the twenty-first
century.]{.underline}

#### Genealogy offers no method of diagnosing the specific mechanisms by which power operates or concrete praxis for people to realize their emancipation from those structures

**Lewandowski 94** \[Associate Professor and Philosophy Program
Coordinator at The University of Central Missouri Philosophy and Social
Criticism, "Heidegger, literary theory and social criticism," Philosophy
Social Criticism.1994; 20: 109-122\]

[Genealogy, in its ostensible analyses of the 'historical specificity of
modern power relations']{.underline}, misses 'the ultimate
ontotheological origins of panopticism or the regime of truth;' (p.
174). Insofar as Heidegger's destruction emphasized the ontological
construction of modernity (its philosophical ground) it was, as we have
seen, a limited agency of critical practice. But insofar as Foucault
(and other contemporary worldly critics) emphasizes its sociopolitical
construction (its scientific/technological ground), his genealogy too
[constitutes a limited agency of critique]{.underline}\.... A dialogue
between their discourses will show that the overdetermined sciences and
the 'residual' humanities \... are, in fact, different instruments of
the anthropo-logos, the discourse of Man, and thus complicitous in the
late capitalist West's neoimperial project of planetary domination. (p.
152) In [this thinking]{.underline} Heidegger with Foucault, and in a
'dialogue between their discourses', Spanos thinks he has the necessary
grounding for a structured theory of social relations with critical
intent, a kind of theory that American literary [theory]{.underline},
from Brooks to de Man, [has been unable (or unwilling) to
articulate]{.underline}, and a kind of theory neither Heidegger nor
Foucault adequately articulated. Heidegger shares many of the problems
that faced an earlier generation of critical theorists interested in
Heidegger (here I am thinking of Marcuse), and many of the problems that
face contemporary philosophical hermeneutics (here I am thinking mostly
of Gadamer and Vattimo). Remember that Marcuse's dissatisfaction with
Heidegger grew, in fact, not simply out of Heidegger's political
engagements but more so out of his failure to link his fundamental
ontology to [any historically concretized praxis]{.underline} (a problem
Spanos is aware of, as I suggested earlier, but never resolves via
[genealogy]{.underline} - a point I shall return to shortly). Heidegger
[never has much to say about agents and their capacity for historically
realizable emancipation]{.underline}: for Heidegger, it is always a
freedom that possesses man, a historical destiny that awaits or calls
us, and not the other way around. Thomas McCarthy raises this
problematic in his essay on 'Heidegger and Critical Theory': Heidegger,
Marcuse wrote, 'remained content to talk of the nation's link with
destiny, of the 'heritage' that each individual has to take over, and of
the community of the 'generation', while other dimensions of facticity
were treated under such categories as 'they' and 'idle talk' and
relegated in this way to inauthentic existence. \[He\] did not go on to
ask about the nature of this heritage, about the people's mode of being,
about the real processes and forces that are history.' (p. 96) The point
to be made here is that Heidegger's politics are not the only (or
necessarily the largest) obstacle to coupling him with critical theory.
Hence much of Spanos's energetic defense of Heidegger against his
'humanist detractors' (particularly in his defiant concluding chapter,
'Heidegger, Nazism, and the 'Repressive Hypothesis': The American
Appropriation of the Question') is misdirected. For as McCarthy rightly
points out, 'the basic issues separating critical theory from
Heideggerean ontology were not raised post hoc in reaction to
Heidegger's political misdeeds but were there from the start. Marcuse
formulated them in all clarity during his time in Freiburg, when he was
still inspired by the idea of a materialist analytic of Dasein' (p. 96,
emphasis added). In other words, Heidegger succumbs quite readily to an
immanent critique. Heidegger's aporias are not simply the result of his
politics but rather stem from the internal limits of his questioning of
the 'being that lets beings be', truth as disclosure, and destruction of
the metaphysical tradition, all of which divorce reflection from social
practice and thus lack critical perspective. Spanos, however, thinks
Foucault can provide an alternative materialist grounding for an
emancipatory critical theory that would obviate the objections of
someone such as Marcuse. But [the turn to Foucault is]{.underline} no
less [problematic]{.underline} than the original turn to Heidegger.
[Genealogy is not critical in any real way.]{.underline} Nor can it tame
or augment what Spanos calls Heidegger's 'overdetermination of the
ontological site'. Foucault's [analysis of power, despite its
originality, is an ontology of power and not]{.underline}, as Spanos
thinks, [a 'concrete diagnosis']{.underline} (p.138) of [power
mechanisms.]{.underline}3 Thus it dramatizes, on a different level, the
same shortcomings of Heidegger's fundamental ontology. The 'affiliative
relationship' (p. 138) that Spanos tries to develop between Heidegger
and Foucault in order to avoid the problem Marcuse faced simply cannot
work. Where Heidegger ontologizes Being, [Foucault]{.underline}
ontologizes power. The latter [sees power as a strategic and intentional
but subjectless mechanism that 'endows itself' and punches out 'docile
bodies']{.underline}, whereas the former sees Being as that neutered
term and no-thing that calls us.

#### Uniqueness is on our side -- praxis has been virtually eliminated from critical theory, and now is key to resurrect it. Taking a stand against the state is not the same as taking action against the state.

We have inherited [a rich tradition of critical theories]{.underline}
that [has served]{.underline} us well [to identify and analyze our
contemporary crises. So much so that the terms "crisis and
critique]{.underline}"---Krise und Kritik---[have become today
homologues]{.underline}. With regard to critical praxis, however, we are
in a slightly different situation. The trajectory of critical praxis,
although influenced by similar historical forces as that of critical
theory, landed us in a somewhat different place. As a result, [many
contemporary critical theorists are disarmed today before the most
fundamental and critical question of these critical times: "What is to
be done]{.underline}?"¶ [This predicament is the product of centuries or
millennia of privileging philosophical inquiry, contemplation, and
reason over]{.underline} what the Greeks referred to as
πρᾶξις---[praxis, or practice, the ethical and political form of
being.]{.underline} The former, theoria, involved predominantly
understanding and comprehension---in essence, knowing---and it was
oriented towards wisdom. The latter, [praxis, revolved around activity,
action, performance---in essence, doing---and it was oriented towards
proper behavior in ethical and political life.]{.underline}3¶ For the
ancients, [these were two different modes of engaging the
world]{.underline}---two among others, poiesis being another---and
[these two categories have shaped human experience ever
since.]{.underline} The early Christian writers drew on them in their
struggle to square contemplative faith with acts of charity. Medieval
scholars pursued the debates and refined an idea of the practical
application of theoretical knowledge. With Enlightenment philosophy,
from Descartes through Kant to the German Idealists, the privilege of
reason tilted the field further toward the mind and away from praxis.4¶
Many critical thinkers during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
struggled to correct the imbalance---Marx, the first among them, as so
strikingly encapsulated in his Theses on Feuerbach.5 The second thesis:
"The question whether objective truth can be attributed to human
thinking is not a question of theory but is a practical question." The
eighth: "Social life is essentially practical." And, of course, the
eleventh.¶ But Marx was by no means alone in his ambition to elevate
praxis. Many critical thinkers followed in his footsteps. Hannah Arendt
privilegeed the vita activa before turning, in her later years, to the
contemplative realm in The Life of the Mind. Michel Foucault extricated
critical theory from the dominant Socratic way---gnōthi seauton, "know
thyself"---and took the path less travelled: practices of the self,
techniques of the self, or what he called "care of self."¶ The tension
played out in different ways and under different rubrics, from the
invisible hand that undermined collective action to debates over "dirty
hands." **[But every time that we, critical theorists, came close to
praxis---from antiquity to the present---it seems we found a way to
divert the conversation back to the contemplative realm]{.underline}**.¶
Socrates got close in the first Alcibiades and the Statesman. There, he
confronted young men who wanted to live the life of praxis, rather than
contemplation. But quickly Socrates made them realize they did not know
much about justice or governing others, and what they needed first was
to gain knowledge. So he convinced them to know themselves first.
Politics is a skill. It requires techne. Like being the captain of a
ship, or shepherd of a flock, there is skill and knowledge to be had. It
requires wisdom first. Knowledge. Contemplation. And that then pushed
everything back to philosophy. It pushed the inquiry back to the
Republic and definitions of justice, and the just person. And Socrates
never got back to the original question: how to act politically.¶
Foucault got close in The Hermeneutics of the Subject and his final
volumes of The History of Sexuality. We had spent too much time on
Socrates' "know-thyself," Foucault argued there. There was a whole other
tradition of practice that we had ignored. Foucault too returned to the
first Alcibiades as a way to explore those practices. He interpreted the
Socratic dialogue as a move toward practices of the self, toward care of
self, rather than simply knowledge of self. But he then pivoted to the
permanent practices of the self in the Stoics and Epicureans; and from
there on, the analysis was almost exclusively trained on practices of
the self. The dimension of subjectivity would dominate the analysis at
the expense of the government of others.¶ Truth-telling, parrhesia, and
the courage of truth are of course essential elements to engage
politics. Speaking out and denouncing injustice is central. Emile Zola's
J'accuse is a classical example---for which Zola was convicted of libel
and had to flee France. Foucault too staked out important political
positions in manifestos, editorials and signed statements on many
occasions. But [notice the model: the influential intellectual, even as
a specific intellectual, taking a stance against the state, at personal
risk to be sure, often alone or in a small collective, standing against
authority. That may be important. It may be necessary. But surely, it
cannot exhaust praxis. Yet, it seemed to, practically
always.¶]{.underline} Most recently, I was reading my friend and
colleague Axel Honneth's new book, The Idea of Socialism---an engaged
intervention seeking to rehabilitate socialism and breathe new life into
it. A deeply committed engagement. A real crie de coeur. Then I hit this
passage:¶ I make no attempt to draw connections to current political
constellations and possibilities for action. I will not be dealing with
the strategic question of how socialism could influence current
political events, but solely how the original intention of socialism
could be reformulated so as to make it once again a source of
political-ethical orientations.6¶ **[No attempt to discuss
"possibilities for action": that is our predicament]{.underline}**.
Somehow, **[praxis invariably takes a second seat to theory. Practice,
practical knowledge, clinical activities become the handmaid of
theoretical knowledge---whether in philosophy, physics, law,
engineering, or critical theory. T]{.underline}**o the point where,
today, in our own field, [**we laud critical theories, but cannot even
properly identify critical praxis.**¶]{.underline} **[No more. This has
to end]{.underline}**. It is time to take stock and begin to chart new
directions for critical praxis. In times like these, [there is a burning
need for a new vision and renewed critical praxis]{.underline}. What
does or should political action look like from a critical perspective
today, especially when the underlying theoretical structure of the
dialectical imagination has become so fractured?¶ This is the most
important question for critical theory in the twenty-first century. [It
is the task]{.underline} that I have set for this book: [to counter
centuries of contemplative complacency and return critical praxis to its
central place in the order of things]{.underline}. In doing so, this
book will strive to address what is, today, the most pressing question
of all: What is to be done?7

### Knowing != Acting

#### Consciousness shifts aren't sufficient for action -- proscription for political action requires a alternative normative means that moves between the macropolitical and the local -- specific goals need political strategies and tactics

Regardless of our political orientations, we operate under the¶ same
dynamic circumstances. Buchanan captures this fluid context:¶ Social
change lawyering is not static; it changes over time. Whether¶ certain
lawyering practices are enabling or disempowering, or¶ whether they
transform or reinforce the status quo, are not questions that can be
discussed meaningfully without reference to a¶ complex web of social,
political, and cultural norms that situate and¶ give meaning to a set of
practices in a particular place and time. 437¶ Hence, \"[adherence to
theory of any sort, even critical theory, will not]{.underline}¶ [stand
the progressive lawyer in good stead unless she also develops
a]{.underline}¶ [sensitivity to the political context in which we act on
and test those]{.underline}¶ [theories.]{.underline} \'438
Unfortunately, as Gordon observes, progressive lawyering literature
fails \"to answer the larger question of how social¶ change occurs.
\'439¶ Karl Marx observed that political consciousness-which he¶ termed
\"subjective\"-is the product of social conditions-which he¶ termed
\"objective. \'4 40 When translated into action, consciousness in¶ turn
can change those conditions. Therein lies the dialectic among¶
consciousness, action and social conditions. [Consciousness may
turn]{.underline}¶ [into action-or it may not. When it does, such action
can take forms]{.underline}¶ [that are either organized (as in strikes)
or unorganized (as in rioting]{.underline}).441 [For political
activists]{.underline} and their lawyers, therefore, [the question is
two-fold: how prevailing and ever-changing social
conditions-\"the]{.underline}¶ [complex web of social, political, and
cultural norms\"]{.underline} of which¶ Buchanan speaks-affect
individual and collective political consciousness, and how and when such
consciousness is likely to translate into¶ action and, in turn, change
those conditions.¶ **[As with articulating alternative normative
visions, here, too, our]{.underline}**¶ **[approaches have been
under-theorized]{.underline}**. Like Buchanan, many scholars enjoin
lawyers to be cognizant of the dynamic social context in¶ which they
work.442 Lopez, for example, acknowledges the need to¶ pay \"attention
not only to international, national, and regional matters but also to
their interplay with seemingly more mundane local¶ affairs. \'443
Framing progressive lawyering within these multiple, interrelated,
dynamic contexts is, of course, essential. But what are our¶ analyses of
the governing historical, social, economic and political¶ context? And
how might they inform potential action?¶ With notable exceptions,444
progressive lawyering theorists have¶ tended to answer these questions
tangentially, recently within the context of community-based campaigns.
At times, the answers come in¶ the form of transhistorical rules to
which a lawyer ought to conform.445 At other times, they are delimited
within and detail the lawyer\'s tasks in local advocacy efforts.446 In
those instances, one might¶ say that larger political analyses are
implicit. Rarely do such analyses¶ directly address the overarching
political context.¶ **[Yet it is only through a grasp of such macro
circumstances that we]{.underline}**¶ **[prioritize and calibrate
activist strategy and tactics. Our clients are]{.underline}**¶
**[steeped in communities of victimization and
resistance]{.underline}**. As Ashar¶ points out in his critique of the
prototypical law clinic that represents¶ only individual clients,
\"\[i\]ndividual clients are part of formal and informal movements of
resistance. \'447 Such \"client-centered\" lawyering¶ approaches¶
\[a\]ssume that clients reach the lawyers in a state of defeat, devoid
of¶ resistance and easily subject to manipulation. As clinicians are
beginning to discover, the starting analysis may be defective. The
assumption of defeat is an analysis made without looking at the real
client in her full context-culturally, politically and economically. It¶
is an assumption made.., without considering the counterbalancing¶ force
which allows the client to survive under incredibly oppressive¶
conditions. It may simply be that lawyers\..., even well-intentioned¶
ones, do not have the tools by which to recognize and measure the¶
skills and the power of resistance. 448¶ **[Motivating]{.underline}**
client **[activism]{.underline}** under dynamic social conditions
**[requires the development and constant assessment and reassessment
of]{.underline}**¶ **[a political perspective that measures that

which we all aspire.¶ Thus, the theoretical need is two-fold: to
construct a broader organizing perspective from a political standpoint,
and to consider activism writ large. Without reading the pulse of

simply on the local dimensions of our¶ work.¶ [The dialectic between a
dynamic social context and political consciousness and action requires a
constant organizational and political]{.underline}¶ [calibration and
modulation often missing from theoretical scholarship]{.underline}.¶
[Without such a working perspective, we are apt to be either
ultra-left]{.underline}¶ [or overly conservative]{.underline}. As Jim
Pope put it recently in the context of¶ new forms of labor organizing:
\"If we limit our vision of the future to¶ include only approaches that
work within the prevailing legal regime¶ and balance of forces, then we
are likely to be irrelevant when and if¶ the opportunity for a paradigm
shift arises. \'449 The cyclical nature of¶ labor organizing, he argues,
mirrors politics generally:¶ American political life as a whole has
likewise alternated between¶ periods characterized by public action,
idealism, and reform on the one hand, and periods of private interest,
materialism, and retrenchment on the other. A prolonged private period
spawns orgies of corruption and extremes of wealth and poverty that,
sooner or later,¶ ignite passionate movements for
reform[.]{.underline}450

### Legal Strategies Key

#### Legal reform is necessary even if it is not sufficient -- working within the legal system is a key tactic that actualizes the potential of mass political activism

In contrast to liberal-legalist practice, [progressive lawyering rests¶
on the sound assumption that no fundamental social change-be it the¶
eradication of racism, poverty, war, sexism, homophobia or other
societal ills-can come about solely through legal reform]{.underline}.14
[Only organized, politicized mass activism from below]{.underline}, 15
aimed at [constantly¶ enhancing and enforcing that social
change]{.underline} 16 or [revolutionizing the¶ entire social and
economic order]{.underline} 17 [can achieve and maintain such¶
goals.]{.underline} 18¶ **[Nevertheless,]{.underline}** in contrast to
what Steve Bachmann has called the \"a-legal\" or \"crude Marxist\"
approach, 19 **[progressive activists recognize that the legal arena
remains a forum for social struggle.]{.underline}** 20 This is¶ so for
three reasons: First, [activists often do not have a choice but to¶ work
within the legal system, as when they are arrested or otherwise¶
prevented from engaging in activism by state authorities]{.underline}.
Second, [because law is relatively autonomous from economic and
political interests]{.underline}, 21 [campaigns for legal reform can win
substantial gains and are¶ frequently the only vehicles through which
more far-reaching change¶ takes shape; struggles for
reform]{.underline}, in other words, [beget more radical¶ possibilities
and aspirations]{.underline}.22 And third, [law is constitutive of the
social order. Law-or, more accurately, the concept of it-is
not]{.underline} (again¶ as some crude analysts would argue) [simply a
tool of one ruling class¶ or other, but rather an essential component of
a just society]{.underline}. 23¶ Commentators observe that [lawyers who
base their practice on¶ these three premises are \"hungry for
theory]{.underline},\" 24 for **[theory checks the¶ \"occupational
hazards \[of\] reformism or cynicism]{.underline}**. 25 [The
theoretical¶ project is thus a dialectic: while law reform alone cannot
\"disturb the¶ basic political and economic organization of modern
American soci ety]{.underline},\"2 6 [law and lawyering are \"a complex,
contradictory, and opentextured setting that provides opportunities to
challenge the status¶ quo.\"]{.underline} 27

#### Even while rejecting statism and reformism, activism needs a legal strategy. Tactical engagement with the law is crucial.

[I want to de-centre law reform as a goal of trans resistance without
ignoring the law or legal systems.]{.underline} My experience as a
poverty lawyer underscored the violence that legal systems like criminal
and immigration enforcement and welfare or disability benefit
eligibility verification processes inflict on vulnerable people. Trans
[resistance needs a legal strategy,]{.underline} but not one focused on
passing legislation that declares us equal but that does not address the
daily violence and poverty produced by transphobia. Trans [politics must
contend with legal systems, since they violently enforce racialized
gender norms and shorten trans people's lives every day]{.underline}.
However, [there is a difference between law reform as our
goal]{.underline} -- assuming that we can get the law to say "good"
things about us and that this will bring relief -- [and understanding
that we need to use law reform as a tactic to dismantle systems of state
violence.]{.underline} Instead of focusing on passing hate crime
legislation and holding onto the fantasy of getting law enforcement to
protect trans people, [we need to launch campaigns to close prisons and
jails, to decriminalize sex work and drugs, and to prioritize other
strategic engagements aimed at disrupting the pathways]{.underline} to
criminalization that are devouring trans populations. **[Legal advocacy
and reform are tactics that can be used to help people survive and to
dismantle apparatuses of state violence,]{.underline}** but law reform
work also risks neutralizing transformative demands, co-opting movement
messages and aims, and dividing constituencies between those who can
benefit from an incremental reform and those who continue to be left
out. I want to shift our focus away from law reform interventions sold
under the rubric of "equality law" -- hate crime laws and
anti-discrimination laws -- and towards the legal and administrative
systems that actually operate in extremely violent and targeted ways.
What the law says about us is far less important than what it is doing
to us. Critical race theorist and prison abolitionist Ruth Wilson
Gilmore defines racism in terms of "the state sanctioned and/or
extra-legal production of group differentiated vulnerability to
premature death." Can you explain why you think Gilmore is so
instructive here and how you use her analysis of "premature death?" I
like that definition because it draws our attention to conditions and
systems of distribution rather than intentions. We think about racism
far too frequently as a question of intentions -- whether or not
somebody intentionally left someone out or did something harmful because
of their biased racist beliefs. The focus on individual racists with bad
ideas hides the reality that racism exists wherever conditions of
racialized maldistribution exist. Law reforms in the US, ostensibly
enacted to prohibit racism, have proven ineffective because they focus
on bad intentions of individuals and fail to comprehend population-level
conditions. When we are forced to find an individual who is responsible
and prove their discriminatory intent, it becomes very difficult to
prove that racism has actually happened. This is part of why Civil
Rights law reforms have not eradicated racism, and why, during the
period when racism has apparently been prohibited in the US, we've seen
a growing racial wealth divide and drastically growing apparatuses of
state violence targeted at people of colour. We cannot address broad
conditions of racialized maldistribution with laws focused on finding
bad individuals with racist intentions. The story about racism that
legal discrimination frameworks establish justifies these conditions and
declares them neutral. It names attempts to remedy them, like
affirmative action programs, as "racist" because taking race into
account is forbidden. Having wildly racially segregated school systems
in the US with drastically lower resources in schools with students of
colour does not violate the law, but creating a program that considers
students' race for purposes of placement in order to desegregate is
illegal. This absurd and perverse "colourblindness" has been heavily
critiqued by critical race theorists. This narrow way of thinking about
racism through the "discrimination principle" justifies the national
story that racism is over and any people or groups who experience
poverty, criminalization, or other marginalization have only themselves
to blame. Gilmore's approach turns this entire framework on its head. In
order to prove racism's existence, we need not identify an individual
racist perpetrator and prove hir racist intent -- we need only identify
that conditions of racialized maldistribution are shortening some
people's lives. People of colour have less access to health care,
education, income, healthy food, and housing. They are
disproportionately exposed to police violence, criminalization,
immigration enforcement, pollution, and the most dangerous forms of
labour. We need not find a mastermind behind each of these conditions to
identify racism or justify intervention. Can you explain and expand upon
what you mean by administrative violence? The term "administrative
violence" draws attention to the ways in which systems that organize our
lives in seemingly ordinary ways -- determining what ID we carry, what
government records exist about us, how roads or schools or garbage
pick-up are organized -- produce and distribute life chances based on
violent forms of categorization. The entire framework of US
administrative law is that we have agencies -- whether it's the
Department of Homeland Security or the Food and Drug Administration or
the Environmental Protection Agency or the Bureau of Indian Affairs --
run by experts. These experts invent and deploy categories that manage
and sort people, substances, buildings, curricula, human capacities,
diseases, financial instruments, streets, soils, vehicles, and more.
These administrators need not be elected; the basis of their authority,
and thus the authority of the administrative system, is neutral
expertise. Critical movements have questioned the neutrality of those
ways of knowing and the categories they produce, identifying white
supremacist, ableist, colonial, and patriarchal norms. Critiques of the
racially disparate impact of drug sentencing laws regarding crack and
powder cocaine are a popular example of this kind of intervention. I am
interested in paying attention to systems of explicit state violence,
like criminal and immigration enforcement systems, as well as systems
that many consider benign, such as those that determine and record the
"facts" about people's births. Distinctions and norms produced by these
systems assign categorizations such as gender and produce deadly
consequences for those who fail to conform to their assigned category.
My work has looked specifically at the interactions between sex
classifications on documents and records like driver's licenses, birth
certificates, and in social security programs, as well as the sex
segregation used in criminal and immigration prisons, juvenile
punishment facilities, and homeless shelters. The work of identifying
violence in the administration of systems that declare themselves race
and gender neutral but are actually sites of extreme racial and gender
violence is central to many social movements. Dorothy Roberts' work, for
example, analyzes the child welfare system in the US and how it targets
Black families. She argues that the system is a continuation of the
natal alienation enforced during slavery. A lot of prison abolitionist
scholarship also critiques the purported scientific neutrality of
policing, criminal trials, sentencing, and rehabilitation schemes that
actually constitute ongoing anti-Black terror. How do you conceive of a
distinctive intervention of critical trans politics? In the 1990s, trans
resistance became increasingly visible, but it obviously wasn't new:
there's been resistance to gender norms by various kinds of gender rule
breakers wherever and whenever there have been gender norms. The
contemporary moment of trans resistance is often expected to follow in
the footsteps of the gay and lesbian rights framework and make some of
the same demands. At the most basic level, identifying critical trans
politics is about finding a way to talk about a trans politics that
isn't interested in military service, marriage, hate crime legislation,
or other elements of today's nightmarishly conservative gay and lesbian
rights agenda. Instead, [it centres transformative resistance to systems
that are the most harmful to trans people.]{.underline} **[It is part of
critical political resistance that raises demands like an end to wealth
and poverty, an end to immigration enforcement, and the abolition of all
forms of imprisonment]{.underline}** (immigration, criminal punishment,
medical, and psychiatric). What critical trans politics has to offer
left social movements more broadly is a particular frame for
understanding how processes of gendered racialization are congealed in
violent institutions. This line of thinking and organizing is informed
by critical race theory's critiques of legal reform and specifically
anti-discrimination law and has important links to analyses developed by
fat politics and disability politics, where norms about body and health
are identified and critiqued. What does it mean that gender segregation
is utilized as a method of control in prisons, juvenile punishment
facilities, shelters, and psychiatric institutions -- where poor people
and people of colour are concentrated? In these places, people who are
difficult to classify, who contest their classification, or who live at
edges of the classification system are targets of particular forms of
violence. Trans politics has, in some ways, extended feminist analysis
about the gender enforcement that takes place in these spaces and
institutions by examining the problems with gender binarism itself.
Trans peoples' experience and our articulation of resistance can be a
location for articulating the political implications of classification
processes. Exposing the complexity of gender category enforcement and
the relationship of various forms of gender identification and
surveillance to state projects of identity surveillance that have
expanded under the "War on Terror" has been an important contribution of
trans studies and trans activism. Earlier we were talking about violence
and how transphobic violence is often imagined as individual "hate
crimes" against trans people. However, conceptualizing "hate violence"
as the biggest singular threat to trans life dangerously misunderstands
early death among trans people. Trans people are dying from the daily
violence of not being able to get basic necessities because systems are
organized in ways that require everyone to be gendered in a particular
way. Trans people die because of exposure to police violence and
criminalization. Trans people die early because we often live with
serious untreated health conditions when health care systems won't treat
people whose gender makes them incomprehensible to that system.
Transphobic violence isn't constituted only in individual acts by
intentional perpetrators, but in the enforcement of gender norms broadly
on everyone, shaping everyone's field of action, existence, and
self-understanding. Trans studies and trans activism makes these
purportedly neutral and sometimes invisible systems of control visible
and political. It also helps us consider why, if we wanted to stop the
murders of trans women of colour, we wouldn't waste our time trying to
enhance policing and prosecution with hate crime laws; we would make
sure that trans women in poverty had safe housing and income and abolish
the immigration and criminal laws that make their lives particularly
dangerous. Critical trans politics relies heavily on tools developed by
different strains of women of colour feminism that question the
racialized deployment of the category "woman" and developed critical
reflective anti-hierarchical and solidarity-based practices and
processes for resistance. Trans politics has raised critical analyses of
things like gender markers on ID and gender segregation in jails and
prisons, but also things like "women-only" spaces in feminist
communities. Like women of colour feminisms, it provides a chance to
look at the enforcement and deployment of certain kinds of norms in the
broader harmful systems that currently distribute well-being, but also
in the alternative spaces we create to cultivate our resistance and
survival. What does it mean to try to produce resistance practices that
contend with norm enforcement not only in government agencies, schools,
welfare offices, prisons, and health departments, but also in our own
resistance formations? As activists seeking transformative change, we
also produce norms about health and the body that perpetuate an
inability to deal with difference, and a desire for standardization.
It's a mistake to assume that the problems of normalization and
population management are only "out there" in the apparatuses of state
violence that activists are struggling with and working to dismantle. In
fact, because we are producing alternative systems of distribution, we
also deploy categories of identity, narratives of authenticity and
deservingness, and notions of enemies, threat, and danger. Trans
politics has critiqued these conditions in certain feminist formations
that have produced trans people as enemies -- traitors, dupes, or
invaders -- drawing harsh and violent gender lines to create supposedly
"safe" spaces. This kind of analysis draws our attention to issues of
intra-group difference, enemy production, and normalization that, in my
opinion, all activists must perpetually engage with. Women of colour
feminisms show how rigorous, continuous processes of critical reflection
are warranted in response to these patterns. Can you explain what you
mean by "gendered racialization?" A basic point in my work is that
nations constitute themselves through processes of creating and
deploying gendered racial categories and racialized gender categories.
The reason I say those two terms together is because they're always
operating together. There aren't universal gender categories -- they are
enforced differently on differently racialized people. For example,
there is no singular norm of femininity or womanhood in the US, but
rather particular norms that are enforced on particular people based on
race, class, nationality, ability, and other social positions. So
processes of racialization and gendering -- processes of creating those
categories and enforcing them -- always happen together. Processes of
racialization always include gendering and invent and enforce gender
categories while inventing and enforcing racial categories. These
processes are fundamental to producing the nation state itself, so they
are critical for us to study and understand. A great example of work
that exposes these processes is Andrea Smith's scholarship about the
enforcement of heteropatriarchal norms as part of North American
colonization. Thinking about race and gender categorization together
helps keep our attention on simultaneity and avoids the kind of
single-vector analysis that falsely universalizes the experiences of
white people or men. Tell me a little bit about the Sylvia Rivera Law
Project (SRLP) and how your work there fits into a larger picture of
radical social movements, law, and trans activism. SRLP is a law
collective in New York City and it provides free legal help to intersex,
trans, and gender non-conforming people who are low-income and/or people
of colour. We're trying to approach trans politics and law in a way that
centres the day-to-day harmful interactions with law enforcement and
administrative systems faced by people who break certain gender norms,
particularly those who face the most violent enforcement of gender norms
because they have the most contact with apparatuses of state violence.
**[In order to be politically engaged and build the movements we want,
we also need to survive; it's about trying to provide people the basic
things they need and advocating for people in danger as part of a
pathway to survival and political action]{.underline}**.

## Biopolitics Good

#### Biopower is key to democratic engagement and protection from state violence

**Dickinson 04** \[Edward Ross, Associate Prof of History at UC
Berkeley, "Biopolitics, Fascism, Democracy: Some Reflections on Our
Discourse About 'Modernity'," *Central European History* 37.1\]

In the Weimar model, then, the [rights of the individual, guaranteed
formally by the constitution and substantively by the welfare system,
were the central element of the dominant program for the management of
social problems.]{.underline} Almost no one in this period advocated
expanding social provision out of the goodness of their hearts. This was
a strategy of social management, of social engineering. The mainstream
of social reform in Germany believed that guaranteeing basic social
rights--- the substantive or positive freedom of all citizens --- was
the best way to turn people into power, prosperity, and profit. In that
sense, [the democratic welfare state was--- and is --- democratic not
despite of its pursuit of biopower, but because of it. The contrast with
the Nazi state is clear. National Socialism aimed to construct a system
of social and population policy founded on the concept of individual
duties, on the ubiquitous and total power of the state]{.underline}, and
on the systematic absorption of every citizen by organizations that
could implant that power at every level of their lives --- in political
and associational life, in the family, in the workplace, and in leisure
activities. In the welfarist vision of Weimar progressives, the task of
the state was to create an institutional framework that would give
individuals the wherewithal to integrate themselves successfully into
the national society, economy, and polity. The Nazis aimed, instead, to
give the state the wherewithal to do with every citizen what it willed.
And where Weimar welfare advocates understood themselves to be
constructing a system of knowledge and institutions that would manage
social problems, the Nazis fundamentally sought to abolish just that
system by eradicating --- by finding a "final solution" to --- social
problems. Again, as Peukert pointed out, many advocates of a
rights-based welfare structure were open to the idea that "stubborn"
cases might be legitimate targets for sterilization; the right to health
could easily be redefined as primarily a duty to be healthy, for
example. But [the difference between a strategy of social management
built on the rights of the citizen and a system of racial policy built
on the total power of the state is not merely a semantic one; such
differences had very profound political implications, and established
quite different constraints. The rights-based strategy was actually not
very compatible with exclusionary and coercive policies; it relied too
heavily on the cooperation of its targets and of armies of volunteers,
it was too embedded in a democratic institutional structure and civil
society, it lacked powerful legal and institutional instruments of
coercion, and its rhetorical structure was too heavily slanted toward
inclusion and tolerance.]{.underline}

#### Biopolitics is a key check preventing democracy's slide into totalitarianism

**Dickinson 04** \[Edward Ross, Associate Prof of History at UC
Berkeley, "Biopolitics, Fascism, Democracy: Some Reflections on Our
Discourse About 'Modernity'," *Central European History* 37.1\]

In short, [the continuities between early twentieth-century biopolitical
discourse and the practices of the welfare state in our own time are
unmistakable.]{.underline} Both are instances of the "disciplinary
society" and of biopolitical, regulatory, social-engineering modernity,
and they share that genealogy with more authoritarian states, including
the National Socialist state, but also fascist Italy, for example. And
it is certainly fruitful to view them from this very broad perspective.
[But that analysis can easily become superficial and misleading, because
it obfuscates the profoundly different strategic and local dynamics of
power in the two kinds of regimes. Clearly the democratic welfare state
is not only formally but also substantively quite different from
totalitarianism.]{.underline} Above all, again, [it has nowhere
developed the fateful, radicalizing dynamic that characterized National
Socialism (or for that matter Stalinism), the psychotic logic that leads
from economistic population management to mass murder.]{.underline}
Again, there is always the potential for such a discursive regime to
generate coercive policies. In those cases in which the regime of rights
does not successfully produce "health," such a system can ---and
historically does--- create compulsory programs to enforce it. But
again, [there are political and policy potentials and constraints in
such a structuring of biopolitics that are very different from those of
National Socialist Germany. Democratic biopolitical regimes require,
enable, and incite a degree of self-direction and participation that is
functionally incompatible with authoritarian or totalitarian structures.
And this pursuit of biopolitical ends through a regime of democratic
citizenship does appear, historically, to have imposed increasingly
narrow limits on coercive policies, and to have generated a "logic" or
imperative of increasing liberalization.]{.underline} Despite
limitations imposed by political context and the slow pace of discursive
change, I think this is the unmistakable message of the really very
impressive waves of legislative and welfare reforms in the 1920s or the
1970s in Germany.90 Of course it is not yet clear whether this is an
irreversible dynamic of such systems. Nevertheless, such regimes are
characterized by sufficient degrees of autonomy (and of the potential
for its expansion) for sufficient numbers of people that I think it
becomes useful to conceive of them as productive of a strategic
configuration of power relations that might fruitfully be analyzed as a
condition of "liberty," just as much as they are productive of
constraint, oppression, or manipulation. At the very [least,
totalitarianism cannot be the sole orientation point for our
understanding of biopolitics, the only end point of the logic of social
engineering.]{.underline}

#### The strategic reversibility of power opens up space for overturning biopolitics through making claims on the state

**Campbell 1998** \[David, Prof of International Politics, *Writing
Security: United States Foreign Policy and the Politics of Identity*, p.
204-5\]

# The political possibilities enabled by this permanent provocation of power and freedom can be specified in more detail by thinking in terms of the predominance of the \"bio-power\" discussed above. In this sense, [because the governmental practices of biopolitics]{.underline} in Western nations [have been increasingly directed toward modes of being]{.underline} and forms of life---such that sexual conduct has become an object of concern, individual health has been figured as a domain of discipline, and the family has been transformed into an instrument of government--- [the ongoing agonism between those practices and the freedom they seek to contain means that individuals have articulated a series of counter-demands]{.underline} drawn from those new fields of concern. For example, as the state continues to prosecute people according to sexual orientation, human rights activists have proclaimed the right of gays to enter into formal marriages, adopt children, and receive the same health and insurance benefits granted to their straight counterparts. [These claims are a consequence of the permanent provocation of power and freedom in biopolitics, and stand as testament to the \"strategic reversibility\" of power relations: if the terms of governmental practices can be made into focal points for resistances, then the \"history of government as the \'conduct of conduct\' is interwoven with the history of dissenting \'counter-conducts.\']{.underline} \"39 Indeed, [the emergence of the state as the major articulation of \"the political\" has involved an unceasing agonism between those in office and those they rule. State intervention in everyday life has long incited popular collective action, the result of which has been both resistance to the state and new claims upon the state.]{.underline} In particular, [\"the core of]{.underline} what we now call [\'citizenship\'\... consists of multiple bargains hammered out by rulers and ruled in the course of their struggles over the means of state action]{.underline}, especially the making of war.\"40 In more recent times, constituencies associated with women\'s, youth, ecological, and peace movements (among others) have also issued claims on society.41 These resistances are evidence that the break with the discursive/ nondiscursive dichotomy central to the logic of interpretation undergirding this analysis is (to put it in conventional terms) not only theoretically licensed; it is empirically warranted. Indeed, expanding the interpretive imagination so as to enlarge the categories through which we understand the constitution of \"the political\" has been a necessary precondition for making sense of Foreign Policy\'s concern for the ethical borders of identity in America. Accordingly, there are manifest political implications that flow from theorizing identity. As Judith Butler concluded: \"The deconstruction of identity is not the deconstruction of politics; rather, it establishes as political the very terms through which identity is articulated. {#the-political-possibilities-enabled-by-this-permanent-provocation-of-power-and-freedom-can-be-specified-in-more-detail-by-thinking-in-terms-of-the-predominance-of-the-bio-power-discussed-above.-in-this-sense-because-the-governmental-practices-of-biopolitics-in-western-nations-have-been-increasingly-directed-toward-modes-of-being-and-forms-of-lifesuch-that-sexual-conduct-has-become-an-object-of-concern-individual-health-has-been-figured-as-a-domain-of-discipline-and-the-family-has-been-transformed-into-an-instrument-of-government-the-ongoing-agonism-between-those-practices-and-the-freedom-they-seek-to-contain-means-that-individuals-have-articulated-a-series-of-counter-demands-drawn-from-those-new-fields-of-concern.-for-example-as-the-state-continues-to-prosecute-people-according-to-sexual-orientation-human-rights-activists-have-proclaimed-the-right-of-gays-to-enter-into-formal-marriages-adopt-children-and-receive-the-same-health-and-insurance-benefits-granted-to-their-straight-counterparts.-these-claims-are-a-consequence-of-the-permanent-provocation-of-power-and-freedom-in-biopolitics-and-stand-as-testament-to-the-strategic-reversibility-of-power-relations-if-the-terms-of-governmental-practices-can-be-made-into-focal-points-for-resistances-then-the-history-of-government-as-the-conduct-of-conduct-is-interwoven-with-the-history-of-dissenting-counter-conducts.-39-indeed-the-emergence-of-the-state-as-the-major-articulation-of-the-political-has-involved-an-unceasing-agonism-between-those-in-office-and-those-they-rule.-state-intervention-in-everyday-life-has-long-incited-popular-collective-action-the-result-of-which-has-been-both-resistance-to-the-state-and-new-claims-upon-the-state.-in-particular-the-core-of-what-we-now-call-citizenship...-consists-of-multiple-bargains-hammered-out-by-rulers-and-ruled-in-the-course-of-their-struggles-over-the-means-of-state-action-especially-the-making-of-war.40-in-more-recent-times-constituencies-associated-with-womens-youth-ecological-and-peace-movements-among-others-have-also-issued-claims-on-society.41-these-resistances-are-evidence-that-the-break-with-the-discursive-nondiscursive-dichotomy-central-to-the-logic-of-interpretation-undergirding-this-analysis-is-to-put-it-in-conventional-terms-not-only-theoretically-licensed-it-is-empirically-warranted.-indeed-expanding-the-interpretive-imagination-so-as-to-enlarge-the-categories-through-which-we-understand-the-constitution-of-the-political-has-been-a-necessary-precondition-for-making-sense-of-foreign-policys-concern-for-the-ethical-borders-of-identity-in-america.-accordingly-there-are-manifest-political-implications-that-flow-from-theorizing-identity.-as-judith-butler-concluded-the-deconstruction-of-identity-is-not-the-deconstruction-of-politics-rather-it-establishes-as-political-the-very-terms-through-which-identity-is-articulated. .Card}
