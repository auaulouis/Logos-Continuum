# Philippines AFF + NEG

There are three different versions of this affirmative (a
policy/security focused, a structural violence/human rights focused, and
a critical/colonialism focused one). They all share many of the same
internal links and solvency claims (arms sales to a horrible leader bad;
complete elimination key), but the impacts are so distinct in framing,
that it would be hard to read them together as multiple advantages. Pick
your approach and defend it.

Luckily, the neg is largely the same for all three versions, the only
difference is how much framing you need to win. Versus the policy aff,
most of the case neg operates as an impact turn to the aff. Versus the
structural violence aff, you can still read the policy args (terror,
china turns, etc.), but you need to win util framing. Finally, versus
the K aff, you should incorporate a framework argument but still read
'arms sales good' arguments.

[THE]{.underline} Department of National Defense ([DND) said President
Duterte's decision to reconsider his earlier order for the]{.underline}
Armed Forces of the Philippines ([AFP) to avoid procuring military
equipment from the United States will **hasten the system and the
delivery of much needed US-made equipment.**]{.underline} DND Spokesman
Arsenio Andolong said [the]{.underline} Chief Executive's [decision will
also provide the military with options and widen its choices for its
source of assets and equipment in line with its ongoing capability
upgrade program. "We welcome the President's pronouncements, and we
would like to thank him for making modernization of the AFP one of his
priorities]{.underline}. Having said that, all of our procurement will
have to undergo the process as stated in the law, RA 10349 and RA 9164,"
Andolong said on Sunday. [Defense Secretary Delfin N. Lorenzana **signed
in April a contract for the procurement** of 16 S-70i Black Hawk
helicopters from Sikorsky, a subsidiary of the American defense
manufacturer behemoth Lockheed Martin, in **the biggest contract yet

cost of P16 billion, will be manufactured out of Sikorsky's plant in

Early in the morning of March 30, [Philippine security forces set out to
execute dozens of search warrants]{.underline} in the remote towns of
Canlaon, Manjuyod, and Santa Catalina on the country's southern Negros
Island. Within hours, **[the operation had left 14 farmers
dead]{.underline}**. The Philippine National Police says the "Negros
14," as they are now known, [were communist rebels killed after refusing
arrest and firing at police officers]{.underline}. Filipino and
[international rights groups refute this claim]{.underline}. A
fact-finding report by a Philippines rights coalition, based on witness
interviews, says that **[police forced family members to stand outside
of their homes before entering and killing their targets, planting
firearms as they departed in order to claim they faced armed
foes.]{.underline}** The chilling report conjures images of the
Philippine drug war, known as Oplan Tokhang---"tokhang" translates to
"knock and plead." [Drug war tactics]{.underline}, which the country's
human rights commission says [could be responsible for as many as
[27,000](https://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/12/05/18/chr-chief-drug-war-deaths-could-be-as-high-as-27000)
extrajudicial killings]{.underline}, have become the foundation of
President Rodrigo Duterte's developing counterinsurgency strategy---and
rights groups allege its range of targets is growing to include an
expanding list of those whom Duterte and his allies consider their
enemies. "There's this morphing, this fusing of tactics that is very
scary," said Carlos Conde, an Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
"This is just the beginning. I think this is the logical morphing of the
drug war." Duterte, who insists a supposed communist plot called "Red
October" [threatens his
presidency](https://www.rappler.com/news/218901-red-october-ouster-plot-vs-duterte-yearend-2018),
recently [threatened to
suspend](https://www.rappler.com/nation/227441-duterte-threatens-writ-habeas-corpus-suspension-declare-revolutionary-war)
the writ of habeas corpus for his critics and unveiled an opposition
"matrix" containing [supposed
links](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/05/13/1917515/duterte-vouches-conspiracy-matrix-hints-wiretaps)
between political opponents, journalists, activists, and communist
leaders. [Security forces]{.underline}, said Conde, [are]{.underline}
"[no longer making any distinction as to who to target as long as the
directive is clear. So they can use the methods of the drug war \[to\]
go after these people."]{.underline} Officially, the Negros Island
operation targeted communist insurgents---harking back to the
[origins](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/07/10/dutertes-death-squads-were-born-in-americas-cold-war/)
of death squads in the Philippines during the Cold War. Days after the
killings, the regional police chief Debold Sinas
[said](https://www.philstar.com/the-freeman/cebu-news/2019/03/31/1906104/negros-oriental-14-rebels-dead)
the deceased "really fought. ... They were not ready to surrender,
because they were hardcore rebels." Eyewitnesses directly dispute this,
according to the fact-finding report. Franklin Lariosa, a farmer living
near Santa Catalina, was allegedly shot three times by policemen as he
sat on a bench next to his 4-year-old son. Police then ordered everyone
in the house to leave before announcing they had found two .38 revolvers
under a pile of dirty laundry, the report says. In Manjuyod, 20 masked
men allegedly entered the home of Valentin Acabal, a de facto village
leader, and dragged his wife and three children into the kitchen, where
they heard the words "Just do it already!" come from upstairs, followed
by three gunshots. Two hours later, police claimed they found a gun
while searching the home; Acabal's family discovered after the search
that 37,000 pesos (about \$710) were missing. [The presidential palace
has maintained these operations were "legitimate" and
[dismissed](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/04/06/1907810/palace-urges-public-not-believe-leftist-propaganda-negros-14)
reports contradicting its account as "leftist propaganda."]{.underline}
But the world is skeptical. On June 7, a group of United Nations human
rights experts [called for a
probe](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-rights-un/u-n-experts-seek-inquiry-into-unlawful-killings-in-philippines-idUSKCN1T80N3?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews)
into what it called a ["staggering number of unlawful deaths and police
killings in the context of the so-called war on drugs, as well as
killings of human rights defenders."]{.underline} Philippines rights
groups said they welcome a U.N. probe, while the presidential palace
[rejected
it](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/06/08/1924735/intellectually-challenged-palace-slams-un-experts-call-probe-staggering-philippines-killings)
as "intellectually challenged" and an "outrageous interference" in the
country's sovereignty. When I visited Negros shortly after the March 30
killings, I encountered an island shaken by fear and distrust, blanketed
by a sense that recent attacks bode for a darker future. The Negros
killings, and a previous state-run operation in December 2018 in which
[six farmers](https://www.apnews.com/c9a4e0708b2e44e5addcf40dd1de6c0c)
were killed, were carried out as part of Oplan Sauron. Named for the
Lord of the Rings villain, Oplan Sauron is part of a recently mandated
increase in militarization and counterinsurgency operations on the
island that share disturbing characteristics with the drug war:
**[killing without due process, planting of evidence, and a growing
climate of apparent impunity.]{.underline}** Negros is the hub of the
country's sugar production and a longtime hotspot for labor activism.
The island is split longitudinally into two provinces, both governed
politically and socially by the island's sugar haciendas, or
plantations. Farmers on the haciendas regularly make between 50 and 70
pesos (96 cents to \$1.35) per day, according to Rolando Rillo, the
chairperson of the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW). The NFSW
is an institution on the island. Established in 1979, it now has around
11,000 members in Negros. Its history of agitating for land reform, and
against the labor practices of powerful plantation owners, makes it a
thorn in the side of Philippine authorities, who have
[accused](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/23/1862505/sugar-workers-group-hits-pnp-npa-legal-front-tag)
it of being a "legal front" for the New People's Army (NPA), a communist
guerrilla outfit. Since its founding in 1969, the NPA has served as the
armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines. Both were
[declared terrorist
organizations](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/950017/duterte-declares-cpp-npa-as-terrorist-organizations)
by Duterte in 2017, following the deterioration of peace talks between
government and communist leaders. The NPA, which has historically
adopted Mao Zedong's strategy of consolidating power in rural areas,
maintains strongholds in agrarian and mountain areas throughout the
Philippines, where it has an estimated 3,700 members---paling in
comparison to the increasingly expansive membership numbers given by the
government. In October 2018, nine NFSW members on a hacienda in Sagay, a
town in Negros, were killed by unknown assailants. Authorities initially
filed charges against nine suspects, including two NFSW recruiters; the
NFSW and rights groups suspect plantation owners were behind the
massacre. Weeks later, an attorney for the slain farmers, Benjamin
Ramos, was [shot
dead](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/07/18/slain-negros-farmers-lawyer-shot-dead)
by unidentified gunmen on motorcycles. [The killings presented more
examples of how Philippine national policy bleeds into local struggles
over land and power.]{.underline} State development initiatives have
long opened the door for farmers, indigenous and Moro groups, and other
marginalized communities to be forced from their land by eager
investors, often protected by military units
[dubbed](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/regions/89872/arroyo-orders-military-to-guard-mindanao-mining-areas/story/)
by one former president as the "investment defense force." These
conflicts have existed under every administration, but Duterte's
inflammatory rhetoric and hard-line counterinsurgency policies are
motivating local power brokers to solve their disputes with violence.
The farmers killed in Sagay were engaged in bungkalan, a regular
practice of tilling a small section of land to grow their own crops
during dry seasons. The NFSW endorses bungkalan as a response to the
failures of the government's ambitious yet ineffectual land reform
program, established in 1988 to gradually disassemble the hacienda
system, a holdover from Spanish colonialism, and return arable land to
independent farmers. "Bungkalan is an expression of land reform," said
NFSW Secretary-General Butch Lozande, who noted it has been practiced
regularly since the 1970s. But Carlito Galvez, the chief of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines,
[said](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/29/1864216/closer-look-bungkalan-supposedly-sinister-plot)
days after the Sagay massacre that bungkalan was a "sinister plot"
hatched by the "international community" to take down the Duterte
administration. **[Duterte himself
[said](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/29/1864201/state-forces-arrest-shoot-groups-occupying-land-duterte-warns?fbclid=IwAR1FICKeEQspegTf6nh085GGTnPFhGa5SNn6Nwb_uUI_tft9n3gUokAmuMY)]{.underline}**
of farmers occupying idle lands: "**[Shoot them. If they resist
violently, shoot them. If they die, I do not care."]{.underline}** The
president then issued an [executive
order](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2018/11nov/20181122-MO-32-RRD.pdf)
in November that called for more police and soldiers to be deployed to
Negros Island, along with the province of Samar and region of Bicol, to
"suppress lawless violence and acts of terror," under the auspices of
the "state of national emergency" Duterte
[declared](http://time.com/4479616/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-obama-davao-blast/)
in September 2016. It's this framework that spawned Oplan Sauron, which
has left 20 farmers dead in two separate police and military operations,
and it leaves rights activists worried this is a test case for the
entire archipelago as Duterte aims to consolidate his power. "It's a
mini-martial law," said Gi Estrada, the media officer for UMA Pilipinas,
an agricultural workers' organization. "Negros is an experiment, a
laboratory for the rest of the country." Negros residents harbor
memories of the horrors of martial law under the dictator Ferdinand
Marcos from the 1960s to the 1980s, and the island experienced unrest in
the 1980s as the global price of sugar plunged, leaving farmers
destitute. In September 1985, 20 protesters were killed by paramilitary
forces in Escalante, a town just east of Sagay. Promised land reforms
never materialized---but violence has returned. In April, about 500
residents of Escalante protested Oplan Sauron and the militarization of
the region, calling for justice for the slain farmers and marching to
the local Department of Agrarian Reform. Less than two weeks later,
Bernardino "Toto" Patigas, a city councilor and longtime advocate for
the region's sugar farmers, was
[killed](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1110151/makabayan-bloc-asks-house-to-probe-killing-of-escalante-city-councilor)
by unidentified gunmen in the town center. Negros resident Arje
Marangga, who works as a secretary for the NFSW near Escalante, attended
the April protest despite her own fears. She told me that on one March
morning she was at home with her parents and her five children when
infantry soldiers knocked on the door at 4 a.m., ordered everyone
outside, and began searching the house for an unknown woman. Once they
failed to find the woman, she said, they said Marangga herself was under
arrest. "I gave them my birth certificate to prove it wasn't me," she
said. The soldiers eventually left, but their continued searching of the
area made the family feel unsafe; her mother and four children have fled
to Cebu, and the rest have not returned home since the incident. "I fear
for my life," she said. The Duterte administration has yet to provide
clear evidence of the alleged links between communist rebels and the
NFSW, along with other rights groups. Some areas of Negros are NPA
strongholds; local media regularly report on clashes between NPA rebels
and state security forces, and NPA recruiters often try to draw
disaffected sugar workers into their ranks. "When they have nowhere to
go, under those difficult circumstances, they will certainly go to the
rebels," Lozande, the NFSW secretary-general, said. The **[new strategy
of extrajudicial killings, however, leaves no day in court for victims,
rebels or otherwise. No distinction is made between the NPA and the
rights groups, journalists, and labor leaders labeled as communists by
the Duterte administration.]{.underline}** Clarizza Singson, the
chairperson of the Negros chapter of the human rights group Karapatan,
showed me her photo on a poster hung in public last year urging citizens
to report her and other supposed communists to the police. Singson, a
noted human rights defender who regularly speaks to audiences abroad,
said she receives regular death threats at home for her advocacy on
behalf of the island's sugar workers. In April, Karapatan and other
rights groups [filed letters of
allegation](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/04/05/1907546/karapatan-raises-red-tagging-concerns-un-officials)
to the United Nations after the government named several legal
nongovernmental organizations as communist fronts and asked the European
Union to stop funding the groups. The Philippines military has said some
funding has been [placed on
hold](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/03/13/1901175/eu-funding-philippine-ngos-put-hold-over-alleged-communist-ties).
The EU has said it will [probe the
allegations](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/04/05/1907546/karapatan-raises-red-tagging-concerns-un-officials)
after earlier asking the Duterte administration to provide evidence of
its claims. Authorities, however, have
[challenged](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/05/03/1914566/albayalde-kmu-prove-youre-not-communist-front)
rights groups to prove they are not affiliated with communists. Conde,
of Human Rights Watch, said central directives serve as a mandate for
authorities in provinces such as Negros. "What the drug war methods have
done is they not only embolden the authorities, they embolden as well
the local leaders who now see the Tokhang \[drug war\]-type campaign as
something they need to support," he said. "This is going to create a lot
of Duterte clones." As the lines continue to blur, the Duterte opponents
caught in his matrix fear the drug war's campaign of extrajudicial
killings will target them next. The new Philippine counterinsurgency is
"Tokhang with search warrants," said Estrada of UMA, the agricultural
workers' organization. "They plant evidence. We plant crops."

Disabling Democratic Checks and Balances As a former mayor, Duterte is
used to governing by decree and by dint of his personality, popularity,
and unrivaled authority. In Davao City, he had no strong political
opposition, significant institutional checks, or close media scrutiny.
Peter Kreuzer, writing in 2009 (when Duterte was mayor), presciently
observed: Duterte makes abundantly clear that there can be security, but
only he himself can provide it**[. Security is provided according to his
personal ideas of justice and adequateness]{.underline}**. In his
political symbolism, Duterte clearly is above the law. It is him, who
indicts, passes judgment and orders the executioners to do their job. It
is a personalized fight between those who do not follow the rules and
the rightful vigilante whose rules reign supreme.45 As president,
**[Duterte has repeatedly expressed his disdain for those who oppose his
policies, and has taken numerous steps to silence his critics and weaken
institutional checks]{.underline}**: Led by Solicitor General Jose
Calida, [the government has weaponized the legal system to attack
political opponents]{.underline}. This began in early 2017 when
opposition Senator Leila de Lima was imprisoned on nonbailable
drug-related charges.46 Groups allied with Duterte, as well as some
leftist organizations, have filed multiple lawsuits against former
president Aquino and former budget secretary Florencio "Butch" Abad, a
longtime leader of the Liberal Party. Most recently, in September 2018
the government arrested Senator Antonio Trillanes IV, a vocal critic of
Duterte. [The government claimed that a presidential pardon granted to
Trillanes by Benigno Aquino in 2011 was invalid]{.underline}, therefore
making Trillanes ineligible to serve as senator.47 **[Duterte has
repeatedly disparaged or threatened the leaders of key accountability
institutions like the chairman of the Commission on Human
Rights,]{.underline}** the chief justice of the Supreme Court, and the
chairwoman of the Office of the Ombudsman. Followers of Duterte
[threatened to seek the impeachment of Ombudsman Conchita
Carpio-Morales, but her term ended in July 2018.]{.underline} Most
disturbingly, in March 2018 Solicitor General Calida filed a quo
warranto petition against then chief justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, and
in May 2018, the Supreme Court---which currently is dominated by
Macapagal Arroyo appointees and in time will be dominated by **[Duterte
appointees---took the unprecedented and arguably unconstitutional step
of removing its own chief justice.]{.underline}**48 The government has
[threatened the mainstream media with lawsuits and nonrenewal of
franchises]{.underline}.49 These threats have been directed at media
owners like [the Rufino-Prieto
family](https://philippines.mom-rsf.org/en/owners/individual-owners/detail/owner/owner/show/the-rufino-prieto-family/),
which owns the Philippine Daily Inquirer, and the Lopez family, which
owns ABS-CBN, the country's largest TV network. In January 2018, the
Securities and Exchange Commission [revoked the operating license of the
highly respected news website
Rappler,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-media/philippine-regulator-revokes-news-sites-license-over-ownership-rules-media-outraged-idUSKBN1F40TE)
[alleging that it has foreign
owners](https://www.rappler.com/nation/176565-sona-2017-duterte-rappler-ownership)
and therefore is in violation of the constitution. In November, the
Department of Justice said that it had grounds to indict both Rappler
and its founder Maria Ressa for tax evasion and failure to file tax
returns.50 **[Meanwhile, on social media, critics of the government are
routinely harassed and threatened. F]{.underline}**inally, Duterte has
periodically raised the specter of declaring martial law nationwide or
forming a revolutionary government that would no longer be bound by the
constitution. Declaring martial law would be constitutional, at least
initially, but would be extremely polarizing politically. However,
declaring a revolutionary government would be an extra-constitutional
act. It seems likely that these statements are intended as trial
balloons to gauge public and elite reactions.The Prospects for Pushback:
Political and Institutional Checks on Duterte. [President Duterte's
continued popularity is not surprising.]{.underline} **[His base of
support is rooted in his persona, his tough approach to fighting drugs
and crime, his proto-populist policies, and the Philippines' continuing
economic growth]{.underline}**. Moreover, Duterte and his supporters
have demonstrated an impressive ability to put their opponents on the
defensive. [They portray individuals and groups associated with the
Aquino administration as incompetent or corrupt elitists]{.underline}.
They accuse defenders of human rights of protecting drug peddlers and
criminals. They charge the mainstream media with being partisan and
disseminating "fake news." **[What then, are the existing and potential
checks on Duterte?]{.underline}**

The Duterte [government's track record regarding human rights and
democracy is undoubtedly disturbing]{.underline}. It has run
**[roughshod over human rights, its political opponents, and the
country's democratic institutions.]{.underline}** The combination of the
Philippines' powerful presidency and the malleability of most of its
political institutions is **[resulting in significant democratic
backsliding]{.underline}**. But to focus only on Duterte fails to
appreciate two other important elements: [the extent to which this
degradation has happened through nominally legal means, and the limited
pushback to date by groups and institutions opposed to strongman
rule]{.underline}. This working paper takes an in-depth look at the
complex dynamics contributing to democratic backsliding in the
Philippines. The Duterte administration's assault on human rights and
democracy also [raises the question of what the U.S. government and
America's nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) **can and should do to

[In Asia, anti-drug rhetoric]{.underline} and action [is **gaining
traction** amongst]{.underline} democratically-elected [leaders who are
ignoring]{.underline}, perhaps willfully, [the **human rights
implications**. First it was south-east Asia, and now south Asia is
joining the trend]{.underline}. Last year, ahead of national elections,

Then earlier this year, [Sri Lanka decided to reintroduce the death

criminals]{.underline}. This week [Amnesty
International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/06/sri-lanka-halt-plans-for-executions-once-and-for-all/)
called on the government not to execute a number of death row prisoners
as part of a grim National Drug Eradication Week (21 June -- 1 July)
initiative. "[This is lazy governance and an effort to convince people
that the political leadership is in charge,]{.underline}" says Meenakshi
Ganguly, the south Asia director at Human Rights Watch. "[Instead of
doing the hard work -- **reforming** the criminal justice system,
enabling police to identify criminals and protecting victims --
political leaders somehow believe that threatening criminals with
hangings will deter them." **The inspiration** for both countries? **The
Philippines**, which]{.underline}, since President Rodrigo Duterte was
elected in 2016, [has embarked on [an incredibly violent war on
drugs](https://www.equaltimes.org/the-international-people-s#.XRM7zvZFw2x)
that has resulted in an estimated 20,000 deaths. The first sign that
other countries would **mimic his tactics** came in]{.underline}

against]{.underline} alleged [drug criminals could be **spreading to
south Asia** where it would have a **hugely detrimental** impact on
**human rights** and the **rule of law**]{.underline}. "It's horrifying

appear tough to the public, claiming that they have a **quick solution**

evidence that the [use and availability of addictive narcotics is
increasing across Asia.]{.underline} In southern Thailand, the use of
crystal methamphetamine has been rising, making addiction the top cause
of divorce in the region. In China, the official number of drug users
has risen from 150,000 in 1991 to 2.5 million in 2017. And seizures of
meth tablets and crystal meth have risen dramatically in south-east Asia
over the past decade, according to the [United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime
(UNODC).](https://www.unodc.org/documents/southeastasiaandpacific/Publications/2019/2019_The_Challenge_of_Synthetic_Drugs_in_East_and_SEA.pdf)
[This increase is driving]{.underline} the sudden [interest in populist,

wide availability of illegal recreational drugs has led to addiction
problems and they want the state to take action," says Ganguly. The
Philippines was also dealing with this challenge, and there were reports
of growing meth usage in parts of major cities such as Manila and Cebu.
Duterte's 2016 presidential campaign hinged on his success in reducing
crime and drug usage while mayor of Davao City, where he debuted his
now-infamous tactics, such as [ordering the use of death
squads.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/02/philippines-president-duterte-drugs-war-death-squads)
[There is a **direct connection** between Duterte's rise and the spread
of violent anti-drugs tactics in Asia. Both Bangladesh and Sri Lankan
authorities have **expressed admiration** for Duterte's
methods]{.underline}. In fact, Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena
announced his desire to resume use of the death penalty after visiting
the Philippines and [calling what he saw there ["**an example to the
world**"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/18/example-to-the-world-sri-lanka-president-plans-to-copy-dutertes-war-on-drugs)]{.underline}.
In Bangladesh, there are clear parallels between the rhetoric of Prime
Minister Hasina and Duterte. Ignorance about drugs, and how to address
their social impacts, allows this rhetoric to take hold. "[It has been
easy for political leaders to simplify the ills of their society by
blaming them on drugs]{.underline}, due largely to the fact that
understanding about drugs is not based on evidence and science but on
morality, ideology and fallacies," says Gloria Lai, regional director
for Asia at the International Drug Policy Consortium. In fact, [the
effectiveness of Duterte's contentious
efforts](https://www.equaltimes.org/the-war-on-drugs-is-ineffective#.XRM_9_ZFw2x)
to reduce drug usage or availability is yet to be proven. The price of
meth remains similar to what it was before Duterte took power, and
reliable figures on drug usage are inconclusive; meanwhile evidence of
police brutality and abuse of power is plentiful. "[Duterte's murderous
ways have **not** rid the Philippines of drugs]{.underline}," Waraich
tells Equal Times. "In their own operations, [the police have planted
evidence in people's homes, faked official incident reports and stolen
possessions from people's homes."]{.underline} A war on the poor and
marginalised Thailand provides another worrying example. While not as
deadly as the Philippines, Thailand embarked on a war on drugs in the
early 2000s, putting tens of thousands of people in jail. Today, more
about [70 percent of the country's prison
population](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-drugs-thailand-prisons/soaring-prison-population-prompts-thailand-to-re-think-lost-drug-war-idUSKCN0ZX01J)
has been interned on drug offenses, yet drug use and availability
remains high. This falls in line with data from the United States, where
narcotics use remains high despite years of harsh anti-drug tactics.
Moreover, [several
studies](https://theconversation.com/theres-no-evidence-that-death-penalty-is-a-deterrent-against-crime-43227)
have shown that the [use of the death penalty]{.underline} as a
deterrent against the trade and usage of narcotics in fact [does very
little to reduce crime]{.underline}. "The death penalty is a simplistic
measure to deceive people into thinking that the government is taking
serious action," says Lai. Also, incredibly worrying to human rights
observers is evidence that the [victims of both extrajudicial killings
and the death penalty tend to be those from **poor** and]{.underline}/or
[**marginalised** communities, not necessarily the]{.underline} people
who run [criminal]{.underline} networks. The **[lack of
accountability]{.underline}** for police [means that the dead can
include victims unconnected to drug use]{.underline}, such as the 2017
killing of 17-year old [Kian Loyd de los
Santos](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/26/world/asia/philippines-teenager-killing-funeral-duterte.html),
or political opponents, as more than 10 of the victims in Bangladesh are
activists for the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
"Breaking the very laws they are supposed to uphold, the [authorities
have acted on the flimsiest evidence]{.underline} to target people
suspected of buying or selling drugs, often in poor neighborhoods," says
Waraich. Despite all the evidence[, there is little momentum to switch
from tactics rooted in violence]{.underline} and force [to one more
rooted in public health: "It's **political symbolism**]{.underline} at
the expense of not just individuals but also communities and societies,
because instead of investing in effectively tackling social problems,
such governments have simply chosen to distract voters," says Lai. If
the goal is political, then the war on drugs has been successful, at
least for its leaders. In the Philippines Duterte remains one of the
most popular politicians in Asia. Similarly, in Indonesia, Jokowi has
seen a jump in his popularity ratings after each round of drug
executions, and has seen no blowback from the rise in extrajudicial
killings. "Jokowi has been using, as much as possible, public issues
that could be exploited on a populist platform, and one of those is
drugs," says Ricky Gunawan, an Indonesian human rights lawyer and
director of the Community Legal Aid Institute (LBH Masyarakat), based in
Jakarta, Indonesia. In Bangladesh, the same trick has also worked well.
Prime Minister Hasina's Awami League party won elections in December
2018 convincingly, taking 288 out of 300 seats in Parliament, despite
numerous allegations of fraud. In the Philippines, Duterte's allies won
a majority in mid-term elections for 12 seats in the Senate. [As long as
voters keep supporting]{.underline} politicians who put [populist
policies ahead of human rights, it is likely that the war on drugs will
**continue** to claim **more victims** across Asia.]{.underline}

#### That cements [authoritarian regionalism]{.underline}---undermines democracy and supports authoritarianism [globally]{.underline}

The ways in which international organizations can support the
democratization process have been the subject of much scholarly
attention. Regional organizations can create incentives for democratic
reforms by offering membership and aid (as the EU did for Central
European states in the early 2000s); by threatening nondemocratic
members with expulsion (as the Organization of American States has
done); or even by launching military interventions (a course taken by
the Economic Community of West African States). By these and other
means, regional organizations can become a force for ensuring the
credibility of countries' commitment to democratization. Existing
theoretical arguments on the impact of regional groupings, however, rely
almost exclusively on the experience of organizations that are composed
of democracies (such as the EU) or created and led by democratic states
(such as the United States). Yet regionalism can also take another,
largely overlooked form---that [of authoritarian regionalism, here
meaning regional organizations founded and dominated by
autocracies]{.underline}.1 There are in fact many [regional associations
**established by nondemocratic nations**]{.underline} or mostly
consisting of nondemocratic states. The Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO), for instance, was founded by China in 2001, and all
its members save two---Kyrgyzstan and new member India, which joined the
grouping in 2017---are autocracies. [This authoritarian subgroup of
regional organizations plays an important role across several parts of
the world]{.underline}. Our analysis shows that even if these
[nondemocratic regional organizations]{.underline} fail to contribute
significantly to economic cooperation among their members, they [can be
**instrumental in stabilizing authoritarian rule**]{.underline} in a
variety of ways. For decades, scholars and practitioners paid little
attention to authoritarian regionalism. There were two primary reasons
for this. First, if one thinks in terms of the traditional functions of
regionalism (such as opening up borders for international trade and the
movement of capital), authoritarian regional organizations are rarely as
successful as those of democratic states.2 Second, while traditional
regionalism relies on credible commitments by the democratic member
states to uphold cooperation, authoritarian states find it difficult to
provide such commitments.3 Yet when it comes to authoritarian
regionalism, these arguments may be missing the point: This phenomenon
entails a different type of regional organization, with different
implications for world politics. [Regional organizations created by
powerful authoritarian states frequently **pursue different goals than
do their democratic counterparts**]{.underline}. To achieve those goals,
[they may use tools such as redistributing resources and providing
legitimacy to smaller and economically weaker autocracies.]{.underline}
By so doing, they help to insulate these weaker members from domestic
turmoil or discontent, as well as from the potentially threatening
influence of international democratic actors. Why do authoritarian
states use regional organizations for this purpose? Hypothetically,
powerful [autocracies could provide resources to smaller states directly
through bilateral relations.]{.underline} What, then, is the specific
benefit offered by authoritarian regionalism? For decades, scholars have
theorized that the spread of regional organizations with very similar
designs or mandates across different parts of the world might reflect
less a rational strategy for dealing with the particular challenges
faced by the participating countries than the influence of a
well-established international norm. The success of the EU created a
powerful image of regional organizations as motors for economic growth,
wellsprings of prosperity and peace. As a result, numerous countries
have "downloaded the global script"4 and established regional
organizations imitating the EU. **[For autocracies, global acceptance of
the idea of regionalism means that their efforts to support like-minded
regimes enjoy extra legitimacy]{.underline}** if these efforts take
place within the framework of a regional organization. Most regional
organizations created by autocrats follow an agenda that reflects a
standard theory prescribing economic integration (based primarily on the
evolution of the EU); this turns these clubs of autocracies into
reputable international organizations. Beyond the façade of economic
cooperation, however, there frequently lies a focus on assisting
friendly autocratic regimes. Much like clauses in autocratic
constitutions that purport to guarantee "free and fair elections"
reflecting the will of the people[, **establishing regional
organizations helps to legitimize authoritarian governments** by
invoking a domestically and internationally acknowledged
standard]{.underline}.5 The fact that authoritarian regionalism is
rarely perceived as a phenomenon distinct from regionalism more broadly,
with its own specific features and policy effects, works in this regard
to the advantage of authoritarian regimes. Second, [authoritarian
regional organizations are commonly seen as signs of high status and
global power for the countries that launch these projects]{.underline}.
Within Russia, for instance, the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union
(inaugurated in 2015) is often presented as the ultimate confirmation of
the country's status as a global power, supposedly representing the
achievement of a "global political balance, whereby Grand Eurasia is a
backbone of world politics in the twenty-first century."6 This idea is
based on a fundamental perception, shared by Russian elites and promoted
by Russian propaganda, of the world as split between competing blocs
fighting for dominance and control. Under these conditions, [powerful
states need their own regional organizations to prevent foreign powers
from encroaching on their spheres of influence,]{.underline} as well as
to ensure that they have a shot at taking part in the global struggle
for the shaping of the world order. The same logic that in the 1880s led
European nations to create vast colonial empires as a means of
reaffirming their place among the great powers compels autocracies in
the 2010s to establish regional organizations. As a result, regimes
expect to win stronger support from domestic populations mesmerized by
the vision of their countries gaining (or regaining) their "rightful
place in the world." Finally, [**regional organizations foster mutual
support among autocracies** by another, more technical, but nonetheless
extremely important means]{.underline}: They form a helpful "focal
point" where authoritarian leaders can regularly meet and learn from one
another. In the modern world, [autocratic regimes watch one another
carefully, trying to find the best strategies for responding to the
challenges they face---**from democratic uprisings and the emergence of
opposition** movements]{.underline} to the flow of information across
national borders and the emigration of citizens. Yet observation alone
may not be enough, especially in the world of nontransparent
authoritarian politics. Frequent direct information exchange, as occurs
at international forums and summits, makes it easier for authoritarian
leaders to find the best ways of preventing and suppressing threats to
their rule. [**Regional organizations institutionalize this kind of
information exchange** by bringing national leaders together on a
regular basis, in settings that lend themselves to both formal and
informal dialogue and thus allow authoritarian learning to
flourish.]{.underline}

#### Democratic governance prevents [extinction]{.underline} -- shoring up [government legitimacy]{.underline} is key

The Rise of a Global Society

Let me first sketch the global democratic project for global governance
as a point of reference. We must first recognize that globalization has
given rise to a global society [for the **first time** in]{.underline}
the [evolution of the]{.underline} human [**species**. We
are]{.underline} now [**stuck with each other**; **[seven and half
billion]{.mark}** people today ---]{.underline} nine to [**ten** by
**2050**:]{.underline} all [**super connected** and **interdependent**.
In greater or lesser measure, humans [are]{.mark} mutually
**[dependent]{.mark}**]{.underline} on each other in the pursuit of
their most salient values, interests, needs, and preferences ---
[[concerns]{.underline} [about]{.underline}]{.mark} personal, community,
and national **[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[sustainable]{.underline} economic **[[growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
protection of [the **[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [equitable
**[distribution]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the globe's material [wealth,
human **[rights]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} even the [validation
of]{.underline} their personal and social [identities]{.underline} by
others. Global [[**warming** is a metaphor]{.mark} of this morphological
social change]{.underline} in the human condition. [**[All]{.mark}**
humans [are **implicated** in]{.mark} this looming]{.underline}
Anthropogenic-induced **[[disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- the
exhausts of billions of automobiles, the methane released in fracking
for natural gas, outdated U.S. coal-fired power plants and newly
constructed ones in China. Even the poor farmer burning charcoal to warm
his dinner is complicit. Since [interdependence surrounds, ensnares, and
binds us as a human society]{.underline}, the dilemma confronting the
world's diverse and divided populations is evident: the [**expanding
scope** as well as]{.underline} the [**[deepening]{.mark}**,
**accumulating**, and **thickening** [interdependencies]{.mark} of
globalization [urge global government.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[But]{.underline} the Kantian ideal of universal governance is beyond
the reach of the world's disparate peoples. [They are **profoundly
divided** by religion, culture, language, tribal, ethnic and national
loyalties as well as]{.underline} by [class, social status, race,
gender, and sexual orientation. How have the]{.underline} [democracies
responded]{.underline} to this dilemma? How have they attempted to
reconcile the growing interdependence of the world's disputing peoples
and need for global governance? What do we mean by the governance of a
human society? [A working, **[legitimate
government]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a human society [[requires]{.mark}
simultaneous responses to three]{.underline} competing [imperatives:
[Order, Welfare]{.mark}, and [Legitimacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the
forms of these OWL imperatives have differed radically over the course
of human societal evolution, [these]{.underline} constraints [remain
predicable of all human societies if they are to replicate]{.underline}
themselves [and flourish over time.]{.underline} The OWL imperatives are
no less applicable to a global society. 1. Order refers to a society's
investment of awesome material power in an individual or body to
arbitrate and resolve value, interest, and preference conflicts, which
cannot be otherwise resolved by non-violent means --- the Hobbesian
problematic. 2. The Welfare imperative refers to the necessity of humans
to eat, drink, clothe, and shelter themselves and to pursue the
full-range of their seemingly limitless acquisitive appetites. Responses
to the Welfare imperative, like that of Order, constitute a distinct
form of governing power and authority with its own decisional processes
and actors principally associated either with the Welfare or the Order
imperative. Hence we have the Marxian-Adam Smith problematic. 3.
Legitimacy is no less a form of governing power and authority,
independent of the Order and Welfare imperatives. Either by choice,
socialization, or coerced acquiescence, populations acknowledge a
regime's governing authority and their obligation to submit to its rule.
Here arises the Rousseaunian problematic. The government of a human
society emerges then as an evolving, precarious balance and compromise
of the ceaseless struggle of these competing OWL power domains for
ascendancy of one of these imperatives over the others. It is against
the backdrop of these OWL imperatives --- Order, Welfare, and Legitimacy
--- that we are brought to the democratic project for global governance.
The Democratic Project For Order, open societies constructed the global
democratic state and, in alliance, the democratic global-state system.
Collectively these initiatives led to the creation of the United
Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the World
Trade Organization, and the European Union to implement the democratic
project's system of global governance. The democratic global state
assumed all of the functions of the Hobbesian Westphalian security state
--- but a lot more. The global state became a Trading, Banking, Market,
and Entrepreneurial state. To these functions were added those of the
Science, Technology and the Economic Growth state. How else would we be
able to enjoy [the **Internet**, **cell phones** and iPhones, or
**miracle cures**]{.underline}? These [are]{.underline} the [products of
the **iron triangle** of the global democratic state]{.underline},
academic and non-profit [research]{.underline} centers, [and
corporations. It is a **myth**]{.underline} that [the
Market]{.underline} System [did]{.underline} all [this **alone**. Fueled
by increasing material wealth, [the democratic]{.mark} global [state was
afforded]{.mark} the means to become [the **Safety Net**]{.mark} state,
[providing **ed**]{.mark}ucation, **[health]{.mark}**, **[social
security]{.mark}**, leisure and recreation]{.underline} for its
population. And as the global state's power expanded across this broad
and enlarging spectrum of functions and roles, the global state was also
constrained by the social compacts of the democracies to be bound by
popular rule. The ironic result of the expansion of the global state's
power and social functions and its obligation to accede to popular will
was a Security state and global state-system that vastly outperformed
its principal authoritarian rivals in the Cold War. So much briefly is
the democratic project's response to the Order imperative. Now let's
look at the democratic project's response to the Welfare imperative. The
democracies institutionalized Adam Smith's vision of a global Market
System. The Market System trucks and barters, Smith's understanding of
what it means to be human. But it does a lot more. The Market System
facilitates and fosters the free movement of people, goods and services,
capital, ideas, values, scientific discoveries, and best technological
practices. Created is a vibrant global civil society oblivious to state
boundaries. What we now experience is De Tocqueville's Democracy in
America on global steroids. As for the imperative of Legitimacy, the
social compacts of the democracies affirmed Rousseau's conjecture that
all humans are free and therefore equal. Applied to elections each
citizen has one vote. [Democratic regimes]{.underline} are also obliged
to submit to the rule of law, to conduct free and fair elections, to
honor majority rule while protecting minority rights, and to
[**promote** human rights]{.underline} at home and
[**abroad**.]{.underline} The Authoritarian Threat to the Democratic
Project [The **democratic project** for **global [governance]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} now [at **risk**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Let's start with the
challenges posed by authoritarian regimes, with Russia and China in the
lead. Both [[Russia and China would]{.mark} **[rest global
governance]{.mark}** on Big Power spheres of influence.
Both]{.underline} would [[assume]{.underline} **[hegemonic
status]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in their]{.underline} respective
[regions, [asserting their]{.mark}]{.underline} [versions of the
**[Monroe Doctrine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Their [regional hegemony
would]{.underline} then **[leverage]{.underline}** [their claim to be
global **Big Powers**.]{.underline} Moscow and Beijing would then have
an equal say with the United States and the West in sharing and shaping
global governance. [[The]{.mark} Russo-Chinese global
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} of Order [[would
ascribe]{.underline}]{.mark} to Russia and China governing privileges
not accorded to the states both aspire to dominate. [[Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} would enjoy [**[unconditional]{.mark}**
recognition of]{.underline} their state
**[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}**, territorial integrity, and
non-interference in their domestic affairs, [but]{.underline} [[they
would]{.underline}]{.mark} reserve to themselves the right to
[**[intervene]{.mark}** in]{.underline} the domestic and foreign affairs
of the [states]{.underline} and peoples under their tutelage [in pursuit
of]{.underline} their [hegemonic interests.]{.underline} President
[Putin]{.underline} has [announced]{.underline} that [[Russia's
**imperialism** encompasses]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[millions]{.underline}** of Russians [living in
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[former]{.underline} republics of the
[Soviet [Union]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia contends that Ukraine and
Belarus also fall under Moscow's purported claim to historical
sovereignty over these states. [Forceful re-absorption of **Crimea** and
control over eastern **Ukraine**]{.underline} [are viewed
by]{.underline} President [Putin as Russia's historical
inheritances.]{.underline} Self-determination is not extended to these
states or to other states and peoples of the former Soviet Union. Moscow
rejects their right to freely align, say, with the European Union or,
god forbid, with NATO. In contrast to the democratic project, universal
in its reach, [the [Russo-Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} conception of a
stable [global [order rests]{.mark} [on]{.mark}]{.underline} more
**[tenuous]{.underline}** and [**[conflict-prone]{.mark}**
**[ethno-national foundations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Russia's
proclaimed enemies are the United States and the European Union. Any
means that undermines the unity of these entities is viewed by Moscow as
a gain. [[The endgame]{.mark} is [a **poly-anarchical**]{.mark}
interstate system,]{.underline} potentially [[as]{.mark} [**war-prone**
as]{.mark} the Eurocentric [system **before**]{.mark} and **after [World
War I]{.mark}**[, but]{.mark}]{.underline} now [populated by states
[with **nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s.]{.mark}** [Global politics
becomes]{.mark} a **[zero-sum]{.mark} game**.]{.underline} Moscow has no
compunctions about corrupting the electoral processes of democratic
states, conducting threatening military exercises along NATO's east
border, or violating the more than 30-year old treaty to ban the
deployment of Intermediate-Range missile launchers, capable of firing
nuclear weapons. Nothing less than the dissolution of the democratic
project is Moscow's solution for global Order. China also seeks a
revision of the global Order. It declares sovereignty over the South
China Sea. Rejected is The Hague Tribunal's dismissal of this claim.
Beijing continues to build artificial islands as military bases in the
region to assert its control over these troubled waters. If it could
have its way, China would decide which states and their naval vessels,
notably those of the United States, would have access to the South China
Sea. Where Moscow and Beijing depart sharply are in their contrasting
responses to the Welfare imperative. Moscow has no solution other than
to use its oil and gas resources as instruments of coercive diplomacy
and to weaken or dismantle existing Western alliances and international
economic institutions. China can ill-afford the dismantling of the
global market system. In his address to the Davos gathering in January
of this year, Chinese President Xi asserted that "any attempt to cut off
the flow of capital, technologies, products, industries and people
between economies, and channel the waters in the ocean back into
isolated lakes and creeks is simply not possible." Adam Smith could not
have said it better. Both Moscow and Beijing have been particularly
assiduous to legitimate their regimes. President Putin's case for
legitimacy is much broader and deeper than a pure appeal to Russian
nationalism. He stresses the spiritual and cultural unity of
Russianspeaking populations spread across the states of the post-Soviet
space. A central core of that unity is the Russian Orthodox Church, a
key prop of the regime. Reviled is Western secularism, portrayed as
corrupt and decadent, viewed by Putin as an existential threat to the
Russian World. The Chinese regime, secular and atheistic, can hardly
rely on religion to legitimate the regime. Beijing principally rests its
legitimacy on its record of economic development and nationalism. The
regime's success in raising the economic standards of hundreds of
millions of Chinese reinforces its claim to legitimacy in two ways. On
the one hand, the Communist Party can rightly claim to have raised
hundreds of millions of Chinese from poverty within a generation. On the
other hand, the Communist Party insists that its model of economic
growth, what critics scorn as crony capitalism, is superior to the
unfettered, market-driven model of the West. Hence capitalism with
Chinese characteristics is more effective and legitimate than the
Western alternative. Where [[Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} do
**[converge]{.underline}** is in [fashioning]{.underline} [their
responses to the Legitimacy imperative. They **[repudiate]{.mark}
Western [liberal]{.mark} [democracy]{.mark}**[. Both reject]{.mark}
criticisms of]{.underline} their [human [rights abuses]{.mark} as
interventions]{.underline} into their domestic affairs. [Dissidents are
harassed, incarcerated, or,]{.underline} in some instances,
[assassinated]{.underline}. Journalists are co-opted, selfcensored,
silenced, or imprisoned. Social [media is state controlled]{.underline}.
Both the [Putin]{.underline} regime [and the]{.underline}
[Chinese]{.underline} [Communist Party]{.underline}
[monopolize]{.underline} the [public narratives evaluating governmental
policy.]{.underline} Transparency and accountability are hostage to
governmental secrecy. Civil society has few effective avenues to
criticize governmental actions. Moscow adds an ironic twist to these
controls in manipulating national elections to produce an elected
authoritarian regime. [[Whether either]{.mark} of these **[authoritarian
responses]{.mark}** to the Legitimacy imperative [will survive **remains
to be seen**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Beijing's use of economic performance
and nationalism to underwrite its legitimacy is a double-edged sword. If
economic performance falters, then legitimacy suffers. Whether top-down
nationalism will always control nationalism from the bottom-up is also
problematic. In resting legitimacy on nationalism, dubious historical
claims, and crypto-religious beliefs, Moscow is spared Beijing's
economic performance test. That said, there is room for skepticism that
in the long-run Russians will exchange lower standards of living for
corrupt rule in pursuit of an elusive Russian mission antagonistic to
the West. The implosion of the Soviet Union, due in no small part to its
retarded economic and technological development, suggests that the
patience of the Russian people has limits. Demonstrations in March 2017
against state corruption in 82 Russian cities, led largely by Russian
youth, reveal these limits. They are an ominous omen for the future of
the Putin kleptocracy. Meanwhile, neither Russia nor China offers much
to solve the Legitimacy imperative of global governance.

#### Arms sales permit the Philippine military to enforce Duterte's agenda -- cutting FMF funding and upholding the Leahy law solves

**Action Network No Date** (Action Network, No Date, \"End US Military
Aid to the Philippines,\" The Action Network,

Currently, [U.S. [taxpayer funds]{.mark} are [bankrolling grave and
worsening human rights violations in the
Philippines]{.mark}.]{.underline} Philippine President Rodrigo
Duterte\'s bloody and repressive regime is the largest recipient of U.S.
military aid in East and Southeast Asia. In July 2018, the United States
announced an additional \$26.5 million in U.S. tax dollars to beef up
support for the Philippine National Police (PNP). U.S. military aid to
the Philippine military and police was at least \$193.5 million last
year not including arms sales, and donated equipment of unreported
worth. Another \$145.6 million is already pledged for 2019.

[The [U.S. government is complicit]{.mark} in]{.underline} \-- and
actively supporting \-- [a worsening human rights crisis in the
Philippines:]{.underline}

- [[Duterte's]{.mark} bloody ["War on Drugs,\"]{.mark} spearheaded by
  the police, has [claimed as]{.mark} many as [27,000
  lives]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- mostly poor and indigent people. Police
  pay monetary rewards to both police officers and vigilantes who
  perpetrate summary executions. Police corruption abounds. Besides
  tagging the unarmed people they have murdered as "fighting back,"
  police have planted evidence; sexually assaulted women and children,
  in exchange for release or dropping drug charges; detained people
  without charges and tortured them to extract bribes, including through
  the use of secret holding cells.

- [[Hundreds of human rights workers, priests, journalists, lawyers,
  trade unionists, environmentalists, teachers, peasant organizers, and
  indigenous leaders have been murdered, tortured, or sexually
  abused]{.underline}]{.mark} since 2016. 12 journalists were killed in
  the first two years under Duterte -- the highest number of murdered
  journalists in the first two years in office of any Philippine
  president. At least 48 environmental campaigners were murdered in 2017
  alone, making the Philippines the second most dangerous country for
  environmentalists, after Brazil. Over 134 human rights defenders have
  been killed under Duterte. In just one case, in 2017, Elisa Badayos
  and Eleuterio Moises were murdered while serving on a fact-finding
  team investigating human rights violations due to militarization in
  Negros Oriental.

- [[Labor leaders are being murdered]{.mark} using tactics similar to

- [U.S. [military aid]{.mark} is [enabl]{.mark}ing the Philippine
  military to carry out [attacks on indigenous communities]{.mark} and
  schools]{.underline}, in partnership with paramilitary groups it arms
  and guides. The use of paramilitaries mirrors genocidal tactics
  carried out against indigenous people in Central and South America
  under U.S. direction, using "counter-insurgency" as an excuse.

- Since 2017, Duterte has imposed Martial Law in Mindanao. [The [siege

  residents]{.underline}, many of whom have still not been allowed to

  December 2018, [[over 368,000 people]{.mark} have been [impacted by
  aerial bombing]{.mark} under Duterte]{.underline}. Militarization has
  caused the mass displacement of nearly 450,000 thousand civilians
  under Duterte.

- When the Philippine Senate tried to restrict funding for Duterte\'s
  Drug War in late 2017, the U.S. stepped in to provide funds that
  filled the shortfall. To evade accountability, Duterte has shifted
  Drug War operations from under the PNP to the Philippine Drug
  Enforcement Agency and back to the PNP\'s general operation funds. The
  Philippine Congress has not been able to provide effective oversight.
  The continuing Drug War killings and rampant human rights abuses only
  underscore that there is no way to ensure U.S. military aid to the
  Duterte regime does not enable human rights violations.

- [[U.S. equipment]{.mark} provides the [backbone of]{.mark} Duterte\'s
  [military modernization]{.mark} program. In 2018, Duterte [pledged to
  double]{.mark} the [salaries of military and police]{.mark}
  personnel]{.underline}. Duterte has massively increased funding to
  \"modernize\" the Philippine military, pouring more funds towards this
  than spent in the last 15 years. He could not do so without U.S. aid
  and arms.

We [[demand]{.mark} that the U.S. [cut military aid]{.mark} to the
Duterte regime]{.underline}. We demand the U.S. end all arms gifts and
sales to the Philippines. We call on Congress to hold a hearing on the
human rights crisis in the Philippines, where witnesses can give
testimony.

We ask:

1\) For the House of Foreign Affairs committee to hold Congressional
hearings on the human rights situation in the Philippines, and the need
to [[cut U.S. military aid]{.mark} to the Philippine military and
police.]{.underline}

2\) For the U.S. [[Congress to restrict F]{.mark}oreign
[M]{.mark}ilitary [F]{.mark}inancing [and counter-narcotics and law
enforcement aid]{.mark} to the Philippines]{.underline} in FY2020.
[[Uphold the Leahy Law]{.mark} which stipulates no funding shall be
furnished to foreign security forces that have committed human rights
abuses]{.underline}.

3\) For Congresspeople to support House Resolution 233 calling on the
Philippine government to release Senator Leila DeLima, a drug war critic
held on trumped up charges, and respect the rights of other human rights
defenders; and Senate Resolution 142, calling for DeLima\'s release and
for charges against journalist Maria Ressa to be dropped.

BANGKOK (AP) --- The [presence]{.underline} [of large
numbers]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [Chinese]{.underline}
[vessels]{.underline} near islands and islets [occupied]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Philippines]{.underline} [is "a
concern]{.underline}," a senior U.S. defense official said Friday.
**[The Philippine government protested the Chinese ship
movements]{.underline}** Thursday after its military monitored more than
200 Chinese vessels from January-March in a disputed area named Sandy
Cay, which is near the Philippine-occupied island of Pag-asa. Asked
about the situation while on a visit to Bangkok, Joseph Felter, deputy
assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, told
reporters that [the U.S. is troubled "by any aggressive activity by any
country in the South China Sea, in this case China. We see that as of
concern."]{.underline} "In this case, [China's activities are of
concern]{.underline}. It seems to be somewhat
**[aggressive]{.underline}** and **[provocative]{.underline}** and we
feel that they're unnecessary and unwarranted," said Felter, who was in
Thailand to attend a meeting of defense officials of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. He noted that the U.S. does not take
a stance on various conflicting claims in the South China Sea. But the
U[.S. commitment to the Indo-Pacific region involves working with allies
and partners to keep the seas free and open and ensure that "no
country's sovereignty is undermined,"]{.underline} he said. "We expect
every country to be able to sail, fly and operate wherever international
law allows." The Philippines regards a chain of islands and islets, nine
of which it occupies, in the Spratly archipelago in the South China Sea
as a municipality it calls Kalayaan under its western province of
Palawan. [That claim conflicts with the larger territorial claims of
China, Vietnam, and three other governments in a long-simmering Asian
dispute]{.underline}. Over the last few years, **[China has stepped up
its territorial claims]{.underline}** [by turning seven made-man islands
it controls into military installations, drawing rebukes from other
claimants as well as Washington]{.underline}. Chinese boats have swarmed
around Sandy Cay, a chain of three sandbars between Pag-asa and a
Chinese man-made island called Subi, since 2017. Such practice could be
meant to pressure other governments into abandoning their islands. A
2002 accord between China and the 10-nation ASEAN aims to prevent armed
confrontation in the busy waterway, where much of Asia's oil and trade
transits. Felter said the meetings he attended also addressed the
lingering threat from the extremism and the Islamic State group in
Southeast Asia and the U.S. looks forward to working with regional
partners on counterterrorism. "It's a threat. We've degraded ISIS in the
Middle East significantly as far as its territory but importantly, it's
still able to recruit and inspire individuals to participate in attacks,
which we've seen recently and sadly we probably haven't seen the last of
this," he said. Relations with Thailand cooled somewhat after a coup in
May 2014 and Felter said the U.S. was looking forward to seeing a
"transparent process" and working with a new government after a March 24
general election. Despite some restrictions on dealings with Thailand's
military government, which remains in power pending the announcement of
final results of the election next month, the U.S. has logged \$469
million in arms sales since 2014, Felter said. "We'll continue to
support Thailand as a close treaty ally and we want to help it build its
defense capabilities," he said. "On the military side it's a healthy
relationship and we look forward to it continuing."

**Bandow 19**(Doug, JD @ Stanford, Senior Fellow @ CATO, 4-7, "The
Philippines \"Mutual\" Defense Treaty Isn\'t Really Mutual at All,"
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/skeptics/philippines-mutual-defense-treaty-isnt-really-mutual-all-50772)n

[For Washington, allies have become the equivalent of Facebook friends:
the more the better.]{.underline} Yet [rarely does America consider the
cost of such military commitments.]{.underline} Officials assume the
mere threat from Washington is enough to force even the most hardened
adversary to back down. That appears to be the attitude of Secretary of
State Mike [Pompeo]{.underline}. On a recent trip to the Philippines, he
[threatened]{.underline} the People's Republic of [China with war lest
it so much looks crossly at "Philippine forces, aircraft or public
vessels."]{.underline} Or more accurately, attack any of them, [which
would "trigger mutual defense obligations]{.underline}." By [which he
meant Washington's unilateral promise to go to war on behalf of Manila.
The "**mutual" in U.S. defense treaties is an inside joke**; no one
expects the Filipino armed services to return the favor]{.underline}.
Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin, Jr. said Manila would
accept America's word, which he interpreted to mean "we have your back."
[Why make such a commitment?]{.underline} The [secretary denounced the
China "threat"]{.underline} and [explained: "China's island-building and
military activities in the South China Sea threaten your
sovereignty]{.underline}, security, [and therefore]{.underline} economic
livelihood, as well as that of [the United States]{.underline}." **[His
statement is false in almost every way]{.underline}**. The PRC's
activities limit Manila's control over a few rocky formations, not the
survival of the Philippine state. [Losing a tussle over those
territories and surrounding natural resources would]{.underline} be
embarrassing but [have little impact on the safety or well-being of
Filipinos]{.underline}. And [such an event would have correspondingly
less impact on Americans]{.underline}, individually or collectively.
[Under normal circumstances, Washington would barely notice the
event.]{.underline} Beijing and Manila are contesting ownership of two
rocks known as Scarborough Shoal (Panatag Shoal to the Philippines and
Huangyan Islets to China). Once administered by Manila, the rocks were
grabbed by the People's Republic of China in 2012, and since then the
two countries have sparred over control. Additionally, another
controversy involves Mischief Reef, located within the Philippine
Exclusive Economic Zone, upon which China has constructed military
facilities, including a runway. The PRC behaved badly, but its claim is
limited to peripheral territory, not the entire Philippines. The region
is filled with such challenges. For instance, Beijing also is contesting
control over elements of the Paracel and Spratly Islands with Vietnam,
Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan, and the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands with Japan.
The specifics of each case vary, but collectively the territorial fights
have triggered a nationalistic surge throughout the region. History does
not justify China, but it helps explain Beijing's aggressive behavior.
Many Chinese policymakers see their nation as only now escaping
centuries of weakness and humiliation. Beijing is making up for lost
time in asserting claims which a couple of decades ago appeared to be
well beyond the PRC's reach. Ironically, China is acting like the young
American republic in the nineteenth century; the latter was truculent,
threatening war against the United Kingdom over the Canadian border and
invading Mexico to enforce dubious claims, seizing half of the latter's
territory. [Washington has no direct stake in the outcome of the
Philippine-China spats]{.underline}, and America's past response
reflected its distance from the controversy. The United States has
consistently criticized the PRC for its violent actions, but despite
America's "mutual" defense treaty with the Philippines, Washington has
avoided any direct confrontation with the PRC. Moreover, [Washington
soft-pedaled its security commitment, to avoid **giving offense to
Beijing and creating an incentive for Manila to act
irresponsibly.**]{.underline} However, Secretary [Pompeo's effusive
promise replaced past caution]{.underline}. "[What Pompeo
said]{.underline} is what the defense establishment actually wanted to
hear," emphasized Julio Amador III of the Manila-based Asia Pacific
Pathways to Progress Foundation. Said Jay Batongbacal of the Institute
for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea: "It [is significant because it
is made publicly and openly by a U.S. secretary of state, and it
expressly refers to applicability to the South China Sea]{.underline}."
He added: "[This is a little bit more pointed and clearer]{.underline}
than previous statements." But why? [Manila is an odd "ally" to whom to
make such a commitment]{.underline}. Early in his presidency,
Phillippine president Rodrigo [Duterte ostentatiously embraced China and
insulted the United States]{.underline}. In fact, he declared his
government's "separation" from Washington and suggested sending American
troops home. More recently, Filipino Defense Secretary Delfin [Lorenzana
warned that if Washington did not clarify the alliance's application to
Scarborough Shoal, ending the relationship was "an option]{.underline}."
Even if his country declined to continue accepting America's defense
subsidies, [Lorenzana argued that "It is not the lack of reassurance
that worries me. It is being involved in a war that we do not seek and
do not want]{.underline}." Indeed, he added, "If the Philippines does
not want to be involved in a war, it can opt out on that basis." That is
Manila's right. But [if the Philippines sees no reason to go along with
the ally protecting it, why should America opt into a war involving
Manila?]{.underline} Surely not because there is an alliance. It is the
sort of [non-mutual "mutual defense treaty]{.underline}" characteristic
of one made in 1951. That treaty [was sixty-eight years ago---a
different time, with different circumstances, different threats, and a
different rationale]{.underline}. The original purpose was mostly to
guard against a rearmed Japan, though the Soviet Union constituted a
convenient secondary threat. Both of those are now gone. The new
"necessary enemy" is China. However, it makes a poor substitute for the
Soviet Union. After all, Beijing is focused on regaining what it
believes to be its proper due after centuries of maltreatment and
humiliation. That means opposing America and its allies when they are in
the way, not in every case as a matter of course. That also means [China
is advancing more restrained objectives---to advance itself rather than
destroy its competitors.]{.underline} In other words, the [PRC threatens
Washington's outsize regional influence, not America's existence and
liberal political order.]{.underline} Although the Philippines enjoys
historical and personal connections with America, the former doesn't
particularly matter for U.S. security. Historically, [the Philippines
have long provided a convenient way station for the U.S.
Navy]{.underline} and an advanced base for the other armed services,
[but that didn't make the archipelago vital for America's defense. The
rocks are even less vital]{.underline}. [Yet battling on Manila's side,
including for such a peripheral interest as the Scarborough Shoal,
**could lead to full-scale war---with a nuclear power**]{.underline}.
[That's an extraordinarily important, and potentially expensive,
commitment.]{.underline} Yet there has been no public debate to justify
expanding America's guarantee. There is a serious argument for
backstopping the independence of friendly states to prevent Chinese
military domination of Asia. However, that appears to be well beyond
Beijing's current capabilities and intentions. The PRC wants influence
but has demonstrated no interest in conquest. Furthermore, if Beijing
swallowed such disparate and distant lands, it would create an
extraordinary burden on the Chinese nation which remains poor and faces
many challenges. Another problem is that America's supposed commitment
remains ill-defined. Foreign Secretary Locsin argued that "In vagueness
lies the best deterrence. I don't believe going down into the details is
the way that the sincerity of the American commitment will be shown."
However, **[ambiguity is potentially dangerous]{.underline}**. [Exactly
what is the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [promising to
protect under what circumstances]{.underline}? [The potential for
mistake and confusion is significant]{.underline}. **[Manila might act
recklessly, convinced of American support]{.underline}**. [China might
respond similarly, certain the United States won't act]{.underline}. If
that happened, [such ambiguity would have helped trigger a
conflict]{.underline}.

[The South China Sea (SCS) and East China Sea (ECS) maritime
conflicts]{.underline}, which have occasionally been likened to "Mexican
standoffs," [have seen steady escalation over recent years]{.underline}.
Contested oil rigs, newly build islands on coral reefs, sunken boats
declared islands, military encounters between air and naval forces,
contested freedom of navigation, and aggressive fishermen acting like
national militias have become an integral part of the SCS. Further
north, unilaterally declared air identification zones, incursions into
air and sea spaces around the Senkaku/Diaoyu/Diaoyutai Islands, locked
radar systems, and hostile diplomatic language have become part of the
ECS conflict. **[Both]{.underline}** **[conflicts have seen a rapid rise
in political and security tensions -- foremost after the recent arbitral
tribunal verdict and through the deployment of military, rather than
non-military (fishermen) or para-military (coast guards)
assets]{.underline}**. Nevertheless these tensions are politically
manageable, and will likely not escalate into full military conflict, at
least for the time being. Despite recent military deployments and
aggressive naval action, [the focus among all actors, regional (Vietnam,
China, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia) and international
(the United States and Australia, among others) is to maintain a
(fragile) peace]{.underline}. **[The rise and increasing use of robotic
technology could drastically alter that peace, giving rise to an
escalation of tension and hostility in which sustained, albeit likely
limited, conflict could become a possibility.]{.underline}** This
relates to two factors: first, the likelihood that so-called unmanned
systems will be deployed in such conflict; second and subsequent, the
still-obscure role of unmanned systems in these conflicts. [The role and
importance of unmanned systems will only further increase in the near
future]{.underline}. [Given the operational and economic advantages of
unmanned systems, it is likely that their current and still-limited
deployment will increase quickly over the next few years, as they have
unique capabilities and qualities that would make them ideal for use in
both the SCS and ECS.]{.underline} They can remain at sea or in the air
for extended periods, patrolling thousands of miles of land and sea --
ideal for the extended geographical distances of the SCS and ECS. The
development, procurement, and operational costs of unmanned systems are
significantly less, making them available for regional actors with
limited military budgets. From a quantitative perspective, we can expect
that the use of unmanned systems in both conflicts will become more
widespread. [On a qualitative level, they have the endurance suited for
large-scale and extended intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) roles]{.underline}. Indeed, medium and high altitude unmanned
systems, such as the Global Hawk and China's Xianglong Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) are able to conduct surveillance of thousands of square
miles within a single day. **[They could provide states with better
means and opportunities to enhance their ISR capabilities, thereby
enabling better situational awareness by providing enhanced audio and
visual ammunition in addition to evidence for media wars over both
conflicts]{.underline}**. These advantages, unique abilities, and
relatively limited costs make it likely that we will see more unmanned
systems on, below, and above the waters of both seas. Indeed, an
analysis of regional unmanned system capabilities show that nearly all
actors have, to different extents, such capabilities. [China has over
the course of the last decade developed a wide array of unmanned systems
and has slowly become one of the world's leaders in unmanned systems
development.]{.underline} It is developing and producing sophisticated
Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) such as the Dark Sword. In
addition, it has already operationally deployed other UAVs such as the
CH-4, an UAV that bears a stark resemblance to the MQ-9 Predator. It is
also developing and is partly capable of deploying Unmanned Underwater
Vehicles (UUVs). [Japan possesses the U.S. developed Global Hawk, a long
endurance, high altitude UAV, and a number of smaller UAVs. It too is
aiming to develop UUVs for maritime security purposes. Vietnam recently
revealed an advanced high-altitude long endurance unmanned system with a
range of 2,500 miles that can remain in flight for up to 35 hours.
Vietnam's HS-6L is the product of nearly 10 years of development and
will likely be used to maintain constant surveillance on Chinese
military deployment and activity in contested SCS waters]{.underline}.
Orbiter 2 and Orbiter 3 drones from Israel have likewise also become
part of Vietnam's arsenal. **[The Philippines has also turned to
unmanned systems in the SCS rivalry]{.underline}**. According to Defense
World, **[the Philippine Defense Department's Modernization Program
includes several projects that will result in the supply of surveillance
systems, including drones]{.underline}**. **[Interest in acquiring
American Predator drones is also largely evident.]{.underline}** Taiwan,
too, has developed a wide array of unmanned systems in recent years,
among others the Chung Shyang II UAV and a newly developed MALE UAV,
which resembles the U.S. MQ-9 Predator. The United States -- the world's
leader in unmanned robotic development -- has already deployed its
unmanned systems (the Global Hawk) in East Asian airspace. [Last April,
U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter]{.underline}, while aboard the
aircraft carrier USS Stennis sailing in the South China Sea -- an
unmistakeable signal for China -- [stated that the United States had
operational UUV capabilities and would deploy them as Washington saw
fit.]{.underline} His visit signaled the determination of the United
States to stand firmly alongside its ally, **[the Philippines, in the
wake of a stout China posture in the area against its much smaller but
equally-determined neighbors]{.underline}**. The deployment of unmanned
systems would, however, not need to directly lead to contested waters,
airspace, and increasing tension. Thousands of vessels and planes fly
and sail through both seas monthly, without leading to violent military
conflict. Rather, **[it is the possible purpose for which these systems
could be used that could give rise to increasing tensions and possible
violent conflict. Unmanned system are relatively easy to spot, making
their military value, beyond ISR roles, relatively
limited.]{.underline}** However, this obvious visibility makes them
ideally suited for political purposes: **[They are perfect tools for
highly visible intrusions into opposing actors' airspaces or sea
zones]{.underline}**. Such actions would fit within the strategy or
tactics of the infamous salami slicing tactics, or as what James Holmes
refers to as small stick diplomacy: **[Small, minor actions, which are
not imminent (major) security threats, but which over time would contest
actors' control, dominance and sovereignty]{.underline}** The utility of
unmanned systems, vis-à-vis manned systems, is that the absence of human
operators creates advantages for the intruding actor. [As no direct
human interaction is possible -- like communication between pilots
within visual range, or crew of naval vessels -- the opposing forces are
limited to only two possibilities: communication or the use of
violence]{.underline}. However, if an actor seeks to communicate, warn,
and to deter the intruding systems, it would need to relay this effort
by means of an extensive and time consuming process: It would need to go
up and through various military and diplomatic channels, after which the
entire communicational effort would need go back down to the operators
of the intruding unmanned system. This is a lengthy, cumbersome process
and one during which an unmanned system could remain in the contested
air or sea space. **[If, however, an actor would decide to not pursue
this lengthy process it can only decide to damage or destroy the
intruding systems. This would be a significant escalation, as it would
be the destruction of military material -- a novelty in a region of
increasing tension -- and could be met with a strong political and
possible military response.]{.underline}** Within the framework of the
public relations and media wars, it would make the defender look like
the aggressor. James Holmes summarized the situation of what to do with
intruding unmanned systems well when he described such operations:
"**[In effect they dare you to escalate]{.underline}**." As such, **[the
use of unmanned systems could favor those seeking the offensive,
intrusive use of such systems for political purposes.]{.underline}**
Particularly actors with significant military powers and the upper hand
could play this game of dare-to-escalate. **[They could engage in a game
of maritime bluff, where they seek to outmaneuver opposing actors with
lesser military capabilities, challenging them to contest their actions
and power.]{.underline}** Approaching the SCS and ECS like a game of
poker is risky strategy, foremost if what is at stake are not merely
chips, but geopolitical powers and human lives. It is therefore
essential that all nations involved in both conflicts develop frameworks
and understandings on how to deal with the rise of unmanned systems and
their possible offensive and assertive use. The South and East China
Seas have recently seen their waters become increasingly stormy though
they remain sailable. It would be a mistake if the rise and use of
unmanned systems turned them into inaccessible waters.

war**.]{.underline} One way this might happen is that [states begin to
use drones to test the nerves, and strategic commitments, of their
potential rivals.]{.underline}

Drones are a seductive way of doing this for two reasons. First, because
drones are not manned aircraft, [states may calculate that their use is
less consequential and risky than manned aircraft]{.underline}. As David
Hastings Dunn has pointed out, [drones appear as a disembodied threat,
which seems to "enable their use with **domestic political
impunity**]{.underline}, minimal international response and low
political risk and cost."66 Second, [because drones are often physically
small, states may calculate that drones may be able to evade detection
in contested space]{.underline}, or at the very least be able to evade
being shot down. The result is that [drones are]{.underline} a new form
of technology, [particularly conducive to]{.underline} what Alexander L.
George referred to as "**[salami tactics]{.underline}**"---that is,
[small steps used to]{.underline} probe or [test deterrent relationships
by violating commitments in a small but measurable way]{.underline}.67

One example of such behavior occurred in fall 2013, when [China
surprised everyone by deploying a drone over]{.underline} the contested
**[Senkaku]{.underline}** Islands in the East China Sea [to test Japan's
commitment]{.underline} to its control over the islands.68 [Japan
scrambled F- 15 fighters in response]{.underline} and suggested that it
might station Japanese personnel on the island in retaliation. [The
situation escalated when China extended its a]{.underline}ir
[d]{.underline}efense [z]{.underline}one [in]{.underline} ways that
covered [these islands and]{.underline} directly [conflicted with
Japan's]{.underline} selfdeclared [a]{.underline}ir
[d]{.underline}efense [z]{.underline}one. [Japan approved a plan to
shoot down Chinese drones that flew over the disputed islands, and China
responded by declaring that such an act would **constitute "an act of
war."**]{.underline}69 In January 2014, Japan announced plans to deploy
three U.S.-made Global Hawk drones by 2015-2016 in an attempt to counter
China's efforts to claim air and naval dominance in the East China Sea
and South China Sea.70 [The result has been **an unprecedented level of
tension** in a relationship that has remained stable, and largely
without such provocative incidents, for decades.]{.underline}

[China's assertiveness in this incident suggests that **those who
assumed that the country would be restrained in its drone use for fear
of escalation or international condemnation might be
mistaken**]{.underline}.71 [The apparent low cost nature of the
technology makes these kind of probing attacks seem more attractive
**even to a generally risk-averse government like China**]{.underline}.
[Drones provide the illusion of a controllable risk]{.underline}
especially if a government can convince itself that the absence of human
casualties from a shoot-down of the drones makes the incident
negligible. Yet [**apparently negligible incidents sometimes have very
real consequences**. The **risks of a conflict spiral** arising from the
shoot-down of the drone or an accident]{.underline} of some kind [in the
E]{.underline}ast [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [are **real and
potentially dangerous**]{.underline}, especially if either [China or
Japan see their national interests or pride at stake]{.underline} in
such an encounter. [Now that China appears willing to throw its weight
around more in the Asian region, its use of drones may increase as a way
of testing Japanese nerves and U.S. commitments to its
allies.]{.underline}

#### East China Sea goes nuclear -- nationalism, alliances, and economics cause escalation and US intervention from even small disputes.

Don\'t look now, but [conditions are deteriorating in the western
Pacific. Things are turning ugly, with consequences that could prove
deadly]{.underline} and spell catastrophe for the global economy.¶ In
Washington, it is widely assumed that a showdown with Iran over its
nuclear ambitions will be the first major crisis to engulf the next
secretary of defense \-- whether it be former Senator Chuck Hagel, as
President Obama desires, or someone else if he fails to win Senate
confirmation. With few signs of an imminent breakthrough in talks aimed
at peacefully resolving the Iranian nuclear issue, many analysts believe
that military action \-- if not by Israel, then by the United States \--
could be on this year\'s agenda.¶ Lurking just behind the Iranian
imbroglio, however, is [a potential crisis of **far greater magnitude**,
and]{.underline} [potentially far more imminent than most of us
imagine]{.underline}. [China\'s determination to assert control over
disputed islands in the potentially **energy-rich waters** of the East
and South China Seas, in the face of stiffening resistance from Japan
and the Philippines along with greater regional assertiveness by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [spells trouble not just
regionally, but potentially **globally.**]{.underline}¶ Islands,
Islands, Everywhere¶ The possibility of an Iranian crisis remains in the
spotlight because of the obvious risk of disorder in the Greater Middle
East and its threat to global oil production and shipping. [A crisis in
the East or South China Seas (essentially, western extensions of the
Pacific Ocean) would,]{.underline} however, [pose a greater peril
because of the possibility of a **U.S.-China military confrontation**
and the **threat to Asian economic stability.**¶]{.underline} [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is **bound by treaty to come
to the assistance of Japan**]{.underline} or the Philippines
[if]{.underline} either country is [attacked by a third
party]{.underline}, [so **any armed clash** between Chinese and
Japanese]{.underline} or Filipino [forces could **trigger American
military intervention**.]{.underline} [With so much of the world\'s
trade focused on Asia, and the American, Chinese, and Japanese economies
**tied so closely together** in ways too essential to ignore, a clash of
almost any sort in these vital waterways might \[freeze\]]{.underline}
paralyze [**international commerce** and **trigger a global
recession**]{.underline} (or worse).¶ All of this should be painfully
obvious and so rule out such a possibility \-- and yet [the likelihood
of such a clash occurring has been **on the rise**]{.underline} in
recent months, [as China and its neighbors continue to **ratchet up**
the **bellicosity** of their statements and **bolster their military
forces** in the contested areas]{.underline}. [Washington\'s continuing
statements about its ongoing plans for a \"pivot\" to]{.underline}, or
\"rebalancing\" of, its forces in [the Pacific have only fueled Chinese
intransigence and **intensified a rising sense of crisis** in the
region. Leaders on all sides continue to affirm their country\'s
inviolable rights to the contested islands and vow to use any means
necessary to resist encroachment by rival claimants.]{.underline} In the
meantime, [China has increased the frequency and scale of its naval
maneuvers in waters claimed by Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines,
further **enflaming tensions in the region.**¶]{.underline} Ostensibly,
these disputes revolve around the question of who owns a constellation
of largely uninhabited atolls and islets claimed by a variety of
nations. In the East China Sea, the islands in contention are called the
Diaoyus by China and the Senkakus by Japan. At present, they are
administered by Japan, but both countries claim sovereignty over them.
In the South China Sea, several island groups are in contention,
including the Spratly chain and the Paracel Islands (known in China as
the Nansha and Xisha Islands, respectively). China claims all of these
islets, while Vietnam claims some of the Spratlys and Paracels. Brunei,
Malaysia, and the Philippines also claim some of the Spratlys.¶ [Far
more is]{.underline}, of course, [at stake than]{.underline} just the
[ownership of]{.underline} a few uninhabited [islets. The seabeds
surrounding them are believed to sit atop **vast reserves
of**]{.underline} oil and [**natural gas.** Ownership of the islands
would naturally confer ownership of the reserves \-- something all of
these countries **desperately desire**]{.underline}. [**Powerful forces
of nationalism** are also at work: with **rising popular fervor**, the
Chinese believe that the islands are part of their national territory
and any other claims represent a direct assault on China\'s sovereign
rights]{.underline}; [the fact that Japan]{.underline} \-- China\'s
brutal invader and occupier during World War II \-- [is a rival
claimant]{.underline} to some of them [only adds a powerful tinge of
victimhood to Chinese **nationalism and intransigence**]{.underline} on
the issue. By the same token, [the Japanese]{.underline}, Vietnamese,
and Filipinos, [already feeling threatened by China\'s growing wealth
and power, believe no less firmly that not bending on the island
disputes is an essential expression of their nationhood.]{.underline}¶
[Long ongoing, these disputes have **escalated recently**.]{.underline}
In May 2011, for instance, the Vietnamese reported that Chinese warships
were harassing oil-exploration vessels operated by the state-owned
energy company PetroVietnam in the South China Sea. In two instances,
Vietnamese authorities claimed, cables attached to underwater survey
equipment were purposely slashed. In April 2012, armed Chinese marine
surveillance ships blocked efforts by Filipino vessels to inspect
Chinese boats suspected of illegally fishing off Scarborough Shoal, an
islet in the South China Sea claimed by both countries.¶ [The East China
Sea has]{.underline} similarly [witnessed tense encounters of
late.]{.underline} Last September, for example, Japanese authorities
arrested 14 Chinese citizens who had attempted to land on one of the
Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands to press their country\'s claims, [provoking
widespread anti-Japanese protests across China and a series of naval
show-of-force operations by both sides in the disputed
waters.]{.underline}¶ **[Regional diplomacy]{.underline}**, [that
classic way of settling disputes in a peaceful manner, has been **under
growing strain** recently thanks to these maritime disputes and the
accompanying military encounters]{.underline}. In July 2012, at the
annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),
[Asian leaders were unable to agree on a final communiqué, no matter how
anodyne]{.underline} \-- the first time that had happened in the
organization\'s 46-year history. Reportedly, [consensus on a final
document was thwarted]{.underline} when Cambodia, a close ally of
China\'s, refused to endorse compromise language on a proposed \"code of
conduct\" for resolving disputes in the South China Sea. Two months
later, when Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited Beijing in
an attempt to promote negotiations on the disputes, she was reviled in
the Chinese press, while officials there refused to cede any ground at
all.¶ As 2012 ended and the New Year began, **[the situation only
deteriorated]{.underline}**. On December 1st, officials in Hainan
Province, which administers the Chinese-claimed islands in the South
China Sea, announced a new policy for 2013: Chinese warships would now
be empowered to stop, search, or simply repel foreign ships that entered
the claimed waters and were suspected of conducting illegal activities
ranging, assumedly, from fishing to oil drilling. This move coincided
with an increase in the size and frequency of Chinese naval deployments
in the disputed areas.¶ On December 13th, [the Japanese military
scrambled F-15 fighter jets when a Chinese marine surveillance plane
flew into airspace near the]{.underline} Diaoyu/[Senkaku
Islands.]{.underline} Another worrisome incident occurred on January
8th, when four [Chinese surveillance ships entered Japanese-controlled
waters]{.underline} around those islands for 13 hours. Two days later,
[Japanese fighter jets were again scrambled when a Chinese surveillance
plane returned to the islands]{.underline}. Chinese fighters then came
in pursuit, the first time supersonic jets from both sides flew over the
disputed area. [The Chinese clearly have **little intention of backing
down**, having indicated that they will **increase their air and naval
deployments** in the area, just as the Japanese are doing.]{.underline}¶
[**Powder Keg in the Pacific**¶]{.underline} While war clouds gather in
the Pacific sky, the question remains: Why, pray tell, is this happening
now?¶ [Several factors seem to be conspiring to **heighten the risk of
confrontation**, including **leadership changes** in China and Japan,
and a **geopolitical reassessment** by the United States.]{.underline}¶
[\* In China, a new leadership team is placing **renewed emphasis on
military strength** and on what might be called **national
assertiveness**]{.underline}. At the 18th Party Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party, held last November in Beijing[, Xi]{.underline} Jinping
was named both party head and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, making him, in effect, the nation\'s foremost civilian and
military official. Since then, Xi has made several heavily publicized
visits to assorted Chinese military units, all clearly intended to
demonstrate the Communist Party\'s determination, under his leadership,
to boost the capabilities and prestige of the country\'s army, navy, and
air force. He has already linked this drive to his belief that his
country should play a more vigorous and assertive role in the region and
the world.¶ In a speech to soldiers in the city of Huizhou, for example,
Xi spoke of his \"dream\" of national rejuvenation: \"This dream can be
said to be a dream of a strong nation; and for the military, it is the
dream of a strong military.\" Significantly, he used the trip to visit
the Haikou, a destroyer assigned to the fleet responsible for patrolling
the disputed waters of the South China Sea. As he spoke, a Chinese
surveillance plane entered disputed air space over the Diaoyu/Senkaku
islands in the East China Sea, prompting Japan to scramble those F-15
fighter jets.¶ \* In Japan, too, a new leadership team is placing
renewed emphasis on military strength and national assertiveness. On
December 16th, arch-nationalist Shinzo Abe returned to power as the
nation\'s prime minister. Although he campaigned largely on economic
issues, promising to revive the country\'s lagging economy, Abe has made
no secret of his intent to bolster the Japanese military and assume a
tougher stance on the East China Sea dispute.¶ In his first few weeks in
office, Abe has already announced plans to increase military spending
and review an official apology made by a former government official to
women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World
War II. These steps are sure to please Japan\'s rightists, but certain
to inflame anti-Japanese sentiment in China, Korea, and other countries
it once occupied.¶ Equally worrisome, Abe promptly negotiated an
agreement with the Philippines for greater cooperation on enhanced
\"maritime security\" in the western Pacific, a move intended to counter
growing Chinese assertiveness in the region. Inevitably, this will spark
a harsh Chinese response \-- and because the United States has mutual
defense treaties with both countries, it will also increase the risk of
U.S. involvement in future engagements at sea.¶ \* In the United States,
senior officials are debating implementation of the \"Pacific pivot\"
announced by President Obama in a speech before the Australian
Parliament a little over a year ago. In it, he promised that additional
U.S. forces would be deployed in the region, even if that meant cutbacks
elsewhere. \"My guidance is clear,\" he declared. \"As we plan and
budget for the future, we will allocate the resources necessary to
maintain our strong military presence in this region.\" While Obama
never quite said that his approach was intended to constrain the rise of
China, few observers doubt that a policy of \"containment\" has returned
to the Pacific.¶ Indeed, the U.S. military has taken the first steps in
this direction, announcing, for example, that by 2017 all three U.S.
stealth planes, the F-22, F-35, and B-2, would be deployed to bases
relatively near China and that by 2020 60% of U.S. naval forces will be
stationed in the Pacific (compared to 50% today). However, the nation\'s
budget woes have led many analysts to question whether the Pentagon is
actually capable of fully implementing the military part of any Asian
pivot strategy in a meaningful way. A study conducted by the Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) at the behest of Congress,
released last summer, concluded that the Department of Defense \"has not
adequately articulated the strategy behind its force posture planning
\[in the Asia-Pacific\] nor aligned the strategy with resources in a way
that reflects current budget realities.\"¶ This, in turn, has fueled a
drive by military hawks to press the administration to spend more on
Pacific-oriented forces and to play a more vigorous role in countering
China\'s \"bullying\" behavior in the East and South China Seas.
\"\[America\'s Asian allies\] are waiting to see whether America will
live up to its uncomfortable but necessary role as the true guarantor of
stability in East Asia, or whether the region will again be dominated by
belligerence and intimidation,\" former Secretary of the Navy and former
Senator James Webb wrote in the Wall Street Journal. Although the
administration has responded to such taunts by reaffirming its pledge to
bolster its forces in the Pacific, this has failed to halt the calls for
an even tougher posture by Washington. [Obama has already been chided
for failing to provide sufficient backing to Israel in its struggle with
Iran over nuclear weapons, and it is safe to assume that he will face
even **great**er **pressure to assist** America\'s **allies** in Asia
were they to be threatened by Chinese forces.]{.underline}¶ [Add these
three developments together, and you have the **makings of a powder
keg**]{.underline} \-- potentially at least as [explosive and dangerous
to the global economy]{.underline} as any confrontation with Iran. Right
now, [given the rising tensions, the first close encounter of the worst
kind, in which]{.underline}, say, [shots were unexpectedly fired and
lives lost, or a ship or plane went down, might be the equivalent of
**lighting a fuse in a crowded, over-armed room**]{.underline}. [Such an
incident could **occur almost any time**.]{.underline} [The Japanese
press has reported that government officials there are ready to
authorize fighter pilots to fire warning shots if Chinese aircraft
penetrate the airspace over the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands. A Chinese
general has said that such an act would count as the start of \"actual
combat.\" That the **irrationality of such an event** will be apparent
to anyone who considers the **deeply tangled economic relations** among
all these powers may **prove no impediment to the situation** \-- as at
the beginning of World War I \-- simply **spinning out of everyone\'s
control.**]{.underline}

#### Arms sales are used internally [rather than for deterrence]{.underline}, but Congress has [full oversight]{.underline} to end them

Election meddling has raised increasing alarm in U.S. politics since the
election of Trump. Now, the same question racks the Philippines.
Recently, in a wash of election fraud, candidates backed by Philippine
President Rodrigo Duterte swept the country's Senate --- including
Ronald "Bato" Dela Rosa, former police chief and architect of Duterte's
drug war. Strangely, now that Duterte has seized control over every
branch of government, he's also become increasingly absent, resurfacing
questions of his health and stability to be president. But if there's
one thing that's clear from this election, it's this: [Duterte's
administration has proved itself **violent and corrupt once again,
worsening a human rights record** whose severity **has long merited an
end of U.S. support.**]{.underline} On top of rampant vote-buying,
evidence of dramatically increased voter fraud and suppression is
mounting. Over 10 times the number of vote counting machines
malfunctioned during this election compared to 2016. Voters who selected
opposition candidates discovered that their voter receipts showed that
their votes had been tallied for Duterte's slate instead. Some ballots
allegedly omitted progressive party lists altogether, while viral social
media posts falsely claimed that these had been "disqualified" for
"destabilizing the government." [**U.S. support has been critical to the
rise of Duterte's** military and police.]{.underline} After publicly
reporting 0.4 percent of precincts' results, the election commission's
servers suddenly shut down for seven hours. When they went back online,
over 90 percent of results were in, proclaiming that Duterte's picks had
won the Upper House. For his part, Duterte made a mockery of democracy,
commenting that vote-buying is "integral" and "there's no one who
doesn't buy votes." Then there's [the intimidation by the Philippine
armed forces, who increasingly function as Duterte's goons
---]{.underline} not only [through his infamous "drug war,"]{.underline}
but during the elections too. In Manila, uniformed police distributed
propaganda newsletters maligning and red-baiting progressive candidates,
a McCarthy-era tactic used not only to intimidate, but to target and
kill activists. Across the country, volunteers for the progressive
Makabayan bloc received death threats and voters were intimidated
through misinformation. Overseas, millions of overseas Filipinos have
been disenfranchised, and their votes left uncounted. One voter,
Dominico Vega, who has been organizing students at California State
University Northridge to lobby for a congressional hearing on the
Philippines, expressed: "The Philippines can feel so far from the San
Fernando Valley, but when friends and family become victims of Duterte's
human rights abuses, it hits close to home. Elections should not silence
us." Vega is right in his call for a congressional hearing on the
Philippines: [U.S. support has been critical to]{.underline} the rise of
[Duterte's military and police. Duterte's regime is **the largest
recipient of U.S. military aid** in East and Southeast Asia. In 2018,
the U.S. sent]{.underline} over \$193.5 million in military aid to the
Philippine military and police, not including [arms sales,]{.underline}
and donated equipment of unreported value. [The U.S. helped inaugurate
Duterte's drug war, which has now claimed as many as 27,000 lives, by
giving the police]{.underline} \$32 million for [equipment]{.underline}
and training in "policing standards" [---]{.underline} clearly
[detrimental]{.underline} when it comes [to human rights.]{.underline}
Less publicized in the U.S[., Duterte has imposed martial law
on]{.underline} the island of [Mindana]{.underline}o since 2017.
[Increased militarization and bombings there, **backed by U.S. drones,
advisors, and special forces**, have caused the displacement of some
450,000 civilians. Philippine soldiers]{.underline} and paramilitaries
[are meanwhile committing atrocities against indigenous communities who
oppose the encroachments]{.underline} of logging and mining
conglomerates. [U.S. military aid, often through **secretive and
unaccountable conduits**]{.underline} in the name of the War on Terror[,
is only making this **internal conflict** and the]{.underline} overall
[human rights crisis worse. **U.S. military aid does not serve to defend
the Philippines**]{.underline} against invaders --- [rather, it is being
**turned against the vulnerable**]{.underline} and marginalized[, the
**journalists** **and human rights defenders, the dissenters.** History
has shown that when the U.S. has made geopolitical calculations at the
expense of people's human rights, that has only **fomented insecurity in
the form of utter collapse.** As the biggest military power]{.underline}
around the globe by far[, the U.S. should prioritize stopping support to
Duterte. **An overblown military presence in Asia Pacific only invites
an arms race with China**.]{.underline} We must stop relying on
militarization to ensure security. Last month, the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors condemned Duterte's human rights abuses and called for a
congressional hearing on the U.S. funds fueling the violations,
responding to the concerns of Filipino residents in the Bay area. Other
U.S. cities should do the same. But most of all, in solidarity with
movements for democracy, human rights, and social justice in the
Philippines, [Congress must **exercise its full powers of oversight** to
end the military aid and arms sales to Duterte's regime.]{.underline}

[A storm is brewing in America's oldest security alliance in the
Indo-Pacific and the administration **needs to act quickly to head it
off**]{.underline}. On December 20, [Philippine Secretary of National
Defense Delfin Lorenzana called for a review of the provisions of the
1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT]{.underline}) between Washington and
Manila. A week later, he confirmed that Philippine government lawyers
had been tasked to study ways to "maintain it, strengthen it, or scrap
it." [The primary reason for this review is what Lorenzana called
**America's "ambivalence" about whether the treaty applies in the South
China Sea**]{.underline}, where Philippine troops and facilities are
under threat from an increasingly assertive China. In a Jan. 8
interview, Lorenzana reiterated [that if America won't clarify the
treaty's scope, then **scrapping it altogether is "an option."** That
would be a **severe blow to U.S. interests in the
Indo-Pacific**]{.underline} and a largely self-inflicted wound by
Washington. Lorenzana and the defense establishment in Manila are
unlikely to demand actual amendments to the MDT. Doing so, even if the
negotiations were successful, would require ratification by the U.S. and
Philippine senates, which seems unlikely in the current political
climates in both capitals. What they seem to want is a public
clarification of U.S. policy regarding the application of the treaty to
the South China Sea, hopefully accompanied by new guidelines to
modernize and operationalize the treaty for the current threat
environment. [Given Washington's interests in countering
Beijing's]{.underline} illegal claims and militarization of the South
China Sea [and the]{.underline} continued [utility of the
U.S.-Philippine alliance, Manila's concerns]{.underline} should be seen
[as entirely reasonable]{.underline} and Washington should move quickly
to resolve them. American Uncertainty Articles IV and V of the MDT
obligate both parties to "act to meet the common dangers" of "an armed
attack on the metropolitan territory of either of the Parties, or on the
island territories under its jurisdiction in the Pacific or on its armed
forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific." But there is no
longer any real threat of invasion of the metropolitan Philippines. The
only external threat to the country is to its holdings and citizens in
the South China Sea. If the treaty doesn't apply there, then Filipinos
might understandably view it as an anachronism. As a result[, Philippine
officials have sought clarity for decades on whether the United States
considers the islands and reefs they occupy in the South China Sea to
fall within the scope of this commitment.]{.underline} The issue became
more urgent in 2012 when China seized Scarborough Shoal from the
Philippines despite a botched U.S. attempt to negotiate a mutual
withdrawal of vessels. In early 2014, President Barack Obama reaffirmed
that the Senkaku Islands administered by Japan in the East China Sea
were covered by Article V of the U.S.-Japan treaty, which has
nearly-identical language to the U.S.-Philippine pact. But during a
visit to Manila as part of the same trip, he refused to give a similar
clarification for the Philippines. Instead he insisted that the U.S.
commitment to the alliance was "ironclad" --- an emotive phrase that
purposely dodged the question. The term "ironclad" has since become a
mantra repeated by every U.S. official asked about treaty application
for the last five years, most recently by Amb. Sung Kim on Dec. 19, to
the chagrin of many Filipinos. Whether the nine Philippine-held features
in the Spratly Islands fall under the scope of the treaty's Article V is
unclear. For one thing, they were occupied by the Philippines after the
treaty was ratified and the United States takes no position on their
ultimate sovereignty. The relative strength of Philippine claims to the
islands compared to those of others like China or Vietnam is unclear,
and the question can only be legally decided by direct negotiation or
arbitration. As with other regional territorial disputes like those over
the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands or the Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo/Takeshima), the
United States steers clear of murky historical questions and insists
only that the disputes be resolved peacefully and in accordance with
international law. [There is also an open question about whether the
reference in the U.S.-Philippine treaty to "island territories under its
jurisdiction" sets a higher bar than the U.S.-Japan treaty,]{.underline}
which uses the language "territories under the administration of Japan."
Scarborough Shoal, which is not part of the Spratlys, is a special case.
U.S. officials concluded during the 1930s that it was legally acquired
by the United States from Spain in the 1900 Treaty of Washington. It was
then transferred to the newly independent Philippines in 1946, which
Washington continued to recognize into the 1980s when it used the area
as a bombing range with Manila's permission. But during the last 30
years, successive U.S. administrations have ignored or forgotten this
historical position and instead adopted the same neutrality toward
Scarborough as toward the Spratlys, believing it grants U.S. policy more
flexibility. But quibbling over whether the islands and reefs themselves
are covered by the treaty is unnecessary. Article IV of the Mutual
Defense Treaty specifies that "an armed attack in the Pacific Area on
either of the Parties" would trigger a common response. Article V
specifies that this includes not only attacks on the metropolitan
territory or islands of the parties, but also "its armed forces, public
vessels or aircraft in the Pacific." In 1998, Defense Secretary William
Cohen affirmed that the United States "considers the South China Sea to
be part of the Pacific Area" and therefore any attack on Philippine
"armed forces, public vessels or aircraft" there would be covered by
Article V. Ambassador to the Philippines Thomas Hubbard reiterated this
in a letter to the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs in 1999.
Unfortunately, that was the last time any U.S. official publicly took a
stance on the issue. And [**that silence has been deafening** in the
wake of developments in the South China Sea and the explicit commitments
made to Japan.]{.underline} The View from Manila Secretary [Lorenzana
has been a champion of the alliance and a **moderating influence** on
the anti-American prejudices of]{.underline} President Rodrigo [Duterte.
That he is **so exasperated and uncertain about Washington's willingness
to follow through on its treaty commitment should be deeply
concerning**]{.underline} and seen as reflective of widespread anxieties
in the traditionally pro-American Philippine defense establishment. U.S.
policymakers and experts might be tempted to believe that the
Philippines has too much to lose to move forward with the review, much
less abrogate the treaty. But from Manila's perspective, gambling now
that a treaty review will elicit a straight answer from Washington
regarding the South China Sea is a smarter bet than gambling later on
whether the United States will come through if China resorts to force.
[During the last decade of American waffling on its treaty commitment,
the threats to Philippine assets in the South China Sea have increased
considerably]{.underline}. Beijing has built and militarized seven
artificial islands in the disputed Spratlys. It has used these to extend
its air, naval, coast guard, and paramilitary presence throughout the
South China Sea, harassing Filipino fishermen, aircraft, and resupply
missions to Philippine-held islets and reefs, including the marine
detachment on the Sierra Madre, a Philippine Navy vessel purposely run
aground at Second Thomas Shoal two decades ago.

Last month, at his end-of-year press conference, the [Philippine
Secretary of National Defense]{.underline} Delfin Lorenzana
[[called](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/21/1878729/defense-chief-seeks-philippine-us-treaty-review)
for a review of the 1951 U.S.-Philippine]{.underline} Mutual Defense
Treaty ([MDT]{.underline}). [Under the terms of this treaty, either side
can unilaterally withdraw. When asked if post-review options included
the Philippines "scrapping" the treaty, Lorenzana's
[reply](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/28/18/scrap-ph-us-treaty-lets-see-lorenzana)
was ambivalent]{.underline}: [**Let's see ...** We are going to approach
this MDT, look at it in the backdrop of what's happening in the area, in
the interest of the nation]{.underline}, not the interest of other
nations. The timing of the call for the review is a surprise. The call
came just after the U.S., earning very [rare
praise](https://www.rappler.com/nation/218985-duterte-balangiga-bells-return-eastern-samar-december-15-2018)
from President Rodrigo Duterte, returned the [Balangiga
bells](https://www.philstar.com/the-freeman/opinion/2018/12/16/1877444/importance-returning-balangiga-bells)
to the Philippines more than a century after American colonialist had
removed them from the Philippines. The MDT also recently proved its
irreplaceable worth during the five-month terrorist siege of Marawi City
in 2017. The U.S. involvement has been
[recognised](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/medias/commentaries/item/6469-end-of-marawi-siege-underscores-critical-importance-ofusphilippine-alliance-by-ian-storey)
by the Armed Forces of the Philippines as "shifting the balance" in
favour of the government forces. The person making the call is an even
bigger surprise, and cause of concern for MDT supporters. While [Duterte
has criticised the MDT and the U.S. for the duration of his term in
office, many, [including Duterte
himself](https://news.mb.com.ph/2017/09/27/my-dnd-chief-is-a-us-agent-duterte/),
have seen Lorenzana as the strongest MDT supporter]{.underline}.
Lorenzana's bombshell is the Philippine equivalent, in effect, to if
James Mattis, when he was U.S. Secretary of Defense, had called for the
review and possible scrapping of a U.S. alliance. Over a quarter century
ago, the Philippines unilaterally weakened its commitment to the MDT by
not renewing the leases on the U.S. bases in the country, thus removing
the major strategic benefit for the U.S. of the treaty. Now, according
to Lorenzana, [the **Philippines wants the U.S. to strengthen its
commitments** under the MDT by extending it to cover the sovereignty
claims of the Philippines in the South China Sea that were made long
after the MDT was ratified.]{.underline} This at a time when Lorenzana's
boss has declared his personal love for Xi Jinping and personal
separation from the U.S., casting further doubt on the commitment to the
MDT of the current Philippine government.

[Terrorism is America's most active worry, but it is quite modest in

Philippines a major non-NATO ally, but that's]{.underline} obviously
[just a friendly lie to stroke Manila's ego.]{.underline} The main
military value of the Philippines is to act as a base for U.S.
operations, these days mostly directed against the PRC. Washington
officials have come to see domination of the Asia-Pacific as an American
birthright. Bases allow U.S. forward deployment of military forces. For
this reason, Mira Rapp-Hooper of the Center for a New American Security
argues that "over the last eight years, the Philippines has become the
linchpin of U.S. diplomatic and national security strategy in Southeast
Asia." Actually, **[Manila is a dubious linchpin of
anything]{.underline}**. [A semi-failed state with an erratic and
lawless leader is hardly a reliable partner]{.underline}. Moreover, the
Philippines wants American assistance in its defense. [Manila most
assuredly does not want to help America battle China on behalf
of]{.underline} other nations, including [the U.S]{.underline}. After
all, [the alliance with America turns the Philippines into a Chinese
target]{.underline}. Walden Bello, who served in the Philippine congress
before joining Japan's Center for Southeast Asian Studies, warned that
his nation is "on the front lines of a superpower struggle for hegemony
in the Asia-Pacific region." Washington sees Manila as part of a
containment strategy. [If war erupted between the U.S. and China, the
former would expect to use its Philippine bases]{.underline}, making
them a legitimate target for the PRC even if the Philippines formally
stayed out of the conflict. [Officials in Manila likely would be
**unwilling to grant the U.S. access to bases** at the very moment when
the Pentagon most desired to use them]{.underline}.

TAIPEI - The [Philippine]{.underline} [foreign]{.underline}
[secretary]{.underline} [says]{.underline} [his]{.underline}
[country]{.underline} [wants]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[buy]{.underline} [American]{.underline} [weaponry]{.underline} [to
shore up defense]{.underline}. But although the two countries have
worked closely together on security over the past 70 years, costs and
broader security worries will make any arms hard to get, experts in Asia
caution. Secretary Teodoro Locsin told a news conference in Manila that
[he and visiting U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo had discussed
the "vital support" of the United States for Philippine military
modernization.]{.underline} Mutual defense, he said, "should cover a
partner's back as well as its front." Locsin later tweeted that he hopes
the U.S. government will sell weapons to "re-arm our military" for
self-defense. But [the Philippines may not be able to afford complex new
weapons systems, while U.S. officials would worry that]{.underline}
Philippine President Rodrigo **[Duterte might use them in his deadly
anti-drug campaign]{.underline}**, experts believe. Duterte for his part
might not want any new U.S. hardware to upset a 3-year friendship with
China, which has its own differences with the United States. "The
geopolitical issue, that's one, second is the limited funding as well as
security concerns when it comes to sourcing equipment," said Collin Koh,
a maritime security research fellow at Nanyang Technological University
in Singapore. "So, in a way it limits the AFP (Armed Forces of the
Philippines)." Political complexity The U.S. Arms Export Control Act
governing foreign sales is what one political consultant called for this
report "a minefield of intricacies and legalities." For that reason,
scholars say, the U.S. government sells its new, high-end arms such as
aircraft largely to long-term partners such as Australia, Singapore and
Taiwan. Those partners know the Act, can pay the billions of dollars for
new equipment and do not turn the weapons on their own people. Sales
sometimes irk China as its navy expands onto the high seas, but Chinese
leaders are used to the repeat customers. [The anti-drug campaign may
raise questions in the United States about "human rights" issues, said
Eduardo Araral, associate professor at the National University of
Singapore's public policy school]{.underline}. Human rights groups say
**[anti-drug police have killed thousands of people without due
process.]{.underline}** China hopes the Philippines, a rival claimant to
sovereignty in the sea between them, will ease away from the United
States as part of a Sino-Philippine friendship that included China's
pledge in 2016 for \$24 billion in aid and investment. "If you sell one
or two ships to the Philippines and the Philippines buys it, what signal
does that send to China, that the Philippines is an un-loyal and
unreliable neighbor and partner?" Araral said. "For the Philippines, you
don't want to send the wrong signal to China." In Southeast Asia, only
Singapore has the formula down for getting U.S.-made weaponry, said Carl
Thayer, emeritus professor at the University of New South Wales in
Australia. Singapore buys American fighters, helicopters and drones.
Officials in Vietnam, he noted, have looked into buying American-made
arms but fear they might get turned down, he said. American lawmakers
may worry Manila would use weapons "recklessly," Thayer said. "There's
no one there, leaving Singapore out, where you have a well-established
relationship that would run smoothly, and where there is none it hits
the bumps in the road,\" he said. Smaller, used and donated arms Manila
and Washington have lived by a mutual defense treaty since 1951,
followed by a visiting forces agreement in 1991 and ongoing joint naval
exercises. U.S. officials count the Philippines as an Asian ally useful
for containing China's maritime expansion -- also a reason Manila wants
to upgrade its navy in case its relations with Beijing someday sour.
Washington also has sold the Philippines pistols, assault rifles,
ammunition and rocket launchers since 1980, according to a Federation of
American Scientists research paper. Small arms used for anti-terrorism
work or coast guard patrols normally cause little political concern,
scholars note. The database GlobalFirePower.com [ranks the Philippine
military strength No. 63 out of 137 countries]{.underline}. Ex-president
Benigno Aquino kicked off a military modernization program that called
for two new frigates or warships, but domestic media said last year a
special assistant to Duterte had "intervened" in the deal to acquire
those from a builder in South Korea. Philippine officials may need to
keep depending on small, donated, refurbished arms for low-key use, and
not just from the United States, Koh said. Foreign sellers are already
obliging. In 2017 South Korea donated a corvette warship to the
Philippine navy, and last year an Australian shipbuilder said it would
deliver six offshore patrol vessels.

#### Arms sales fuel humanitarian abuses in the form of extrajudicial killings, forced displacement, and state-sanctioned violence under the guise of Duterte's war on drugs.

The burgeoning [alliance between President Donald Trump and Philippine
President Rodrigo Duterte appears destined to become the 21st century
version of the Ronald Reagan-Ferdinand Marcos alliance.]{.underline}
That [union in the 1980s allowed the Marcos dictatorship to last 14
years, despite Marcos' notoriety for murdering over 3,000 people as well
as jailing 70,000 and torturing 34,000 of his political rivals and other
innocent people.]{.underline} Reagan stood by his Filipino ally to the
bitter end, even granting Marcos asylum in Hawaii when it became clear
that "people power" would soon topple the unsustainable dictatorship.
According to Reagan, granting a haven to Marcos and 90 of his family
members and close associates was "in the best interests" of
U.S.-Filipino relations. Those interests included a network of some of
the largest U.S. military bases in the world at the time. Such die-hard
support for a brutal dictator was immoral back then. Knowing [the legacy
of trauma that the Marcos dictatorship inflicted on the Filipino people
and the country as a whole makes supporting the admittedly fascist
upstart dictator Duterte completely unjustifiable]{.underline} today.
When Reagan took power in 1980, Marcos had already been ruling the
Philippines under martial law for eight years, with the full support of
former Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter.
[Reagan's support for an additional six years meant Marcos and his
military could rack up more human rights abuses with
impunity.]{.underline} Today, [Duterte is well on track to surpass the
body count of his self-proclaimed idol. An estimated 13,000 people have
been killed in the war on drugs; 113 activists have been
killed]{.underline} under the U.S.-designed counterinsurgency program of
the Philippine government; and [more than 400,000 people have been
forcibly displaced]{.underline} due to the Philippine military's aerial
bombing of Marawi City and nearby communities of indigenous people
throughout the southern island of Mindanao, under the guise of the war
on terrorism. [At the rate Duterte is going, this could mean the murder
of 52,000 more people over the remainder of his six-year
term.]{.underline} The Philippines is home to 100 million people, the
majority of whom are dirt poor, largely due to 119 years of U.S. policy
toward the country. For his part, Trump has bluntly stated his interest
in the Philippines. "It is a strategic location ― the most strategic
location. And, if you look at it, it's called the most prime piece of
real estate from a military standpoint," Trump said during his visit to
the Philippines in November. No need to mince words: [for the U.S., the
Philippines remains, as it has always been, an essential cog in the U.S.
war machine.]{.underline} Never mind that today the Philippines is home
to 100 million people, the majority of whom are dirt poor, largely due
to 119 years of U.S. policy toward the country. With no sustainable
domestic industry to speak of and an economy grossly dependent on
exports in large part because of the colonial legacy left behind by
first Spain and then the U.S., [the Philippines under Marcos began to
systematically export its people to work in foreign countries --- and
send remittances home to keep the Philippine economy afloat. Today,
poverty is so severe that nearly 6,000 Filipinos leave the country every
single day in search of work; the Philippine economy would collapse were
it not for \$27 billion in remittances]{.underline} these migrant
workers send home annually. At the turn of the 20th century, the U.S.
acquired the Philippines as a colony and relinquished the country only
after World War II, when dependable local puppet leaders could be
installed and economic and military treaties cementing the Philippines
to U.S. interests could be imposed. These include patently unequal
military agreements that tie the Philippines to the whims of U.S.
imperial ambitions: the Mutual Defense Treaty, Mutual Logistics Support
Agreement, Visiting Forces Agreement and, most recently, the Enhanced
Defense Cooperation Agreement. These agreements grant the U.S. military
expansive access to military facilities, land, water and airspace in the
Philippines for an indeterminate length of time under the guise of
"mutual benefit." Conveniently, the U.S. military presence has been
focused in resource-rich regions of the Philippines, facilitating
land-grabbing and extraction of the country's natural wealth by
multinational corporations. Challenges to the constitutionality of the
agreements have been brought to the Philippine Supreme Court repeatedly
as the Filipino masses have staunchly protested U.S. military presence
and operations on Philippine territory for decades. After all, they have
experienced the brunt of the violence against women and children, toxic
waste, forced displacement from land and other crimes committed by the
U.S. military. For the U.S. in the 1970s and '80s, propping up the
Marcos regime served the purpose of securing its military stronghold in
the Pacific as the Cold War approached its climax. Neighboring Vietnam
had resoundingly defeated the imperialist American invaders just a few
years earlier. The U.S. and Soviet Union were engaged in a nuclear arms
race. Today, Trump needs Duterte and the Philippines to remain a
dependable ally for U.S. imperial interests in the Asia Pacific region.
Trump's current brinkmanship with North Korea means that the threat of
nuclear war looms large. Trump has named China repeatedly as one of the
biggest rivals to U.S. economic superiority in not only the region but
the world. China, the Philippines and neighboring countries dispute
territorial control of the waters and islands in the South China/West
Philippine Sea, which contains vast petrochemical and gas deposits, rich
marine biodiversity, and sea lanes that facilitate much of the global
trade and shipping for the entire region. [In January, the U.S. Defense
Department announced it had launched the counterterrorism mission
"Pacific Eagle: Philippines,"]{.underline} which is designated as an
Overseas Contingency Operation, thereby [making it eligible for
exemptions from spending limits. The operation will only strengthen the
Duterte regime]{.underline} as it continues to crack down on vulnerable
minority populations. The 1 percent may agree with Trump that it is in
the best interests of their America to continue supporting Duterte. [The
rest of us should not be complicit in the slaughter.]{.underline} Last
week, [the International Criminal Court officially opened a preliminary
investigation into allegations of state-sanctioned killings and other
human rights violations]{.underline} committed by the Philippine
National Police under the direction of Duterte. Now, [U.S. lawmakers
should join others in the international community and stop enabling
Trump's agenda in the Asia Pacific to be propped up by the rising body
count of Filipinos killed under Duterte's war on drugs and war on
terrorism. Funding for Duterte's death squads in the form of U.S.
Foreign Military Financing aid to the Philippine military and police
should be struck altogether from future U.S. budget
allocations.]{.underline} Congress should go a step further and study
the effect of such agreements between the U.S. and the Philippines, such
as the Mutual Defense Treaty, Visiting Forces Agreement and Enhanced
Defense Cooperation Agreement. These provide the basis for continued
support to the Philippine military in the first place, even when these
same state security forces are implicated in the majority of
extrajudicial killings and other human rights violations. Moreover,
these agreements have been used to shield the U.S. military and its
personnel from accountability for crimes committed in Philippine
territory, essentially subordinating Philippine sovereignty to U.S.
military interests. Is that really any different from Reagan's
justification for his granting of asylum to a murderous dictator? [Can
the U.S. depart from over 100 years of colonial treatment of the
Philippines and instead deploy a framework of mutual respect, mutual
benefit and respect for national sovereignty? Absent this, we should
expect to birth more puppet presidents and dictators]{.underline} in the
Philippines.

#### It's a modern-day genocide.

**Simangan 17** \[Dahlia Simangan, Center for Policy Research, United
Nations University, Tokyo, Japan, "Is the Philippine "War on Drugs" an
Act of Genocide?" Taylor & Francis 7-17-2017
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623528.2017.1379939\] //AT

This article has analysed Duterte's "war on drugs" by scoping existing
news articles, government briefings, public speeches and available
drug-related statistics. [Duterte's "war on drugs" is a textbook case of
what the processes of genocide look like]{.underline}. Drug suspects in
the Philippines are classified as "bad" and labelled as criminals
through symbolisms. **[Duterte, his administration and his supporters
believe that drug suspects are not human, or less human than
them.]{.underline}** As it is a state-sanctioned policy, the "war on
drugs" is highly organized with both state and non-state actors
participating in anti-drug operations. This drug war is also polarizing,
with one side of the debate wanting to get rid of drug suspects by
whatever means possible and the other side wanting to protect their
human rights. [Duterte's administration has created enforcement
programmes, mobilized police and military apparatuses, and silenced or
threatened political critics in order to efficiently exterminate drug
suspects]{.underline}. He has also encouraged civilians to participate
not just in reporting drug suspects but also in shooting them. Duterte
is happy to slaughter millions of drug suspects, likening himself to
Hitler. He has ordered "shoot-to-kill" operations and assured officers
involved in these operations of his support and protection. [Duterte
justifies his policies using a rhetoric of fear, hatred and paranoia in
order to deny accountability for the deaths from his "war on
drugs."]{.underline} Police officers in anti-drug operations eliminate
evidence that drug suspects were unarmed and compliant. Due to this
state-sponsored violence, witnesses and family members are intimidated
out of speaking for the victims. [Duterte and his administration
continue to block independent investigations and threaten critics of his
policies while putting into positions of power people]{.underline}
Duterte feels indebted to despite their lack of qualifications and
experience. Considering all these factors, **[Duterte's "war on drugs"
satisfies the stages of genocide]{.underline}** as Stanton describes
them. It may not fully satisfy the legal definition of genocide but it
has the characteristics found in stages of classification,
symbolization, dehumanization, organization, polarization, preparation,
extermination and denial. This approach departs from limiting genocide
to its legalistic definition and considers a more contextual analysis of
what constitutes an act of genocide. The analysis in this article also
reveals that [stages of genocide can be overlapping, interconnected and
non-linear.]{.underline} First, in Duterte's "war on drugs,"
symbolization happens simultaneously with extermination when drug
suspects are killed and labelled with cardboard signs. Second, the
dehumanization stage traverses other stages. Drug suspects are
dehumanized in the classification, symbolization and extermination
stages. Third, these stages can also be non-linear. After the deaths of
drug suspects, Duterte and his administration propagate rhetoric that
polarizes the public in their opinions of human rights, crime and public
policy on drugs. Inquiring whether the Philippine "war on drugs" is an
act of genocide produces two opposing but not mutually exclusive
answers. The answer is no if the inquiry is kept within the confines of
the legalistic definition of genocide. The answer is yes based on
Stanton's stages of genocide and other broader definitions of genocide.
Applying Stanton's stages of genocide is an alternative approach to
explaining genocidal events that may not fall under the traditional or
conventional conceptualization of genocide. The problem with this
approach, as Moses warns, is that "it may identify situations as at
least 'pre-genocidal' that it does not intend to highlight." 148
However, in the case of the Philippine "war on drugs," [the stages of
genocide have already all been fulfilled.]{.underline} Some may also
argue that Duterte may be responsible for crimes against humanity but
not genocide. While this may be true, how does one reconcile the fact
that the Philippine "war on drugs" fulfils all the stages of genocide?
Perhaps it is at this point that i[t is more rational to depart from
definitionalism and instead focus on what must be done to avert this
humanitarian crisis]{.underline}, whatever name one prefers to give it.
As Stanton laments, "debating whether mass killing fits the conventional
definition of genocide is most often an excuse for non-action." 149 Even
if one does not accept that the Philippine "war on drugs" is an act of
genocide, using Stanton's stages adds to existing discussions and
measures on genocide prevention. It sheds light on events related to and
hopes to set an alarm for the state-sponsored humanitarian crisis in the
Philippines. It is also a particularly useful analytical lens for
explaining how perpetrators of genocide operate and a confirmation that
genocide is a process,150 a progression of events, and a series of
planned methods operated by organized actors and agencies. **[Calling
the mass murder of drug suspects in the Philippines a "war on drugs"
removes its human toll]{.underline}**. It must be called what it is---a
mass murder of unarmed, often poor civilians suspected of using drugs.
At his command, Duterte's administration has successfully incited, if
not wholly organized, the killings of more than 7,000 Filipinos out of
fear and a hatred of heinous crimes previously committed by either
suspected or proven drug users. They have justified the killing of drug
suspects by claiming that if they were not killed, they would kill. It
is murdering the "murderer" before the murder happens.

#### That violence is imposed onto a criminalized, eradicable "other".

Why has Duterte made illegal drugs his signature issue? In addition to
viewing drugs as a cancer on society, [there is an ugly political
logic.]{.underline} Combating drugs and crime was central to his
reputation as an effective mayor of Davao City. [Moreover, public
acceptance of the Davao Death Squad, a shadowy group that specifically
targeted suspected drug dealers, petty criminals, and homeless youth,
showed the low cost and high returns of mounting an extra-legal war on
drugs and crime]{.underline}.24 As president, Duterte's nationwide war
on drugs continues to **[play well across most socioeconomic segments of
society, particularly as long as the principal victims are the urban
poor.]{.underline}** The drug war also offers a potent and useful
political narrative in which [Duterte alone possesses the moral
authority to rescue the country from the dangers posed by drug pushers
and other criminals.]{.underline} As Peter Kreuzer, a German researcher,
has observed: Duterte not only successfully established crime as the
most pressing problem, but **[also made the unconditional fight against
this threat into a hallmark of a comprehensive "we"
group.]{.underline}** Given the assumed absoluteness of the evil to be
combated, any criticism of the president has been silenced.
**[Detractors are suspected of being supporters of the criminal threat
to society, and any reference to due process can be
ignored.]{.underline}**25 This narrative of drugs as an existential
threat has been used [to justify imprisoning opposition Senator Leila de
Lima]{.underline} (a prominent critic of Duterte's drug war), [to
exercise control over local officials, and to frame the motivation of
the Islamic extremists]{.underline} who took over Marawi City26 Public
attitudes about the war on drugs. [Most Filipinos believe that Duterte's
war on alleged drug users and pushers is a draconian but necessary
response to a serious social problem.]{.underline} Survey data have
shown strong but softening support for it: in December 2016, 85 percent
of those surveyed voiced satisfaction, though by June 2018, only 78
percent were satisfied.27 At the same time, almost three out of four
Filipinos (73 percent) believe that EJKs happen, almost as many are
concerned that they might be a victim of an EJK, and a large majority
think that it is important for the police to capture suspects alive.28
Why is there such strong public support for the drug war? [One
explanation offered is that it reflects widespread disillusionment with
the Philippine justice system]{.underline}. Certainly, rich and powerful
Filipinos enjoy near-total impunity while many poor and middle-class
Filipinos see the system's high costs, delays, partiality, and
corruption. **[However, the degree of alienation should not be
overstated:]{.underline}** few Filipinos ever go to court, and surveys
indicate that the judiciary and the police both enjoy moderately high
approval ratings. **[A second explanation is that Duterte has
successfully dehumanized suspected drug pushers and users and turned
them into a threatening "other" to be eradicated by any means
available]{.underline}**. **[As such, they do not deserve legal
protections, rehabilitation, or empathy. This view might erode if the
war on drugs expanded to target alleged drug users in the middle and
upper classes]{.underline}**.

penalty with the expressed reason stated as the ability to execute drug
criminals]{.underline}. This week [Amnesty
International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/06/sri-lanka-halt-plans-for-executions-once-and-for-all/)
called on the government not to execute a number of death row prisoners
as part of a grim National Drug Eradication Week (21 June -- 1 July)
initiative. "[This is lazy governance and an effort to convince people
that the political leadership is in charge,]{.underline}" says Meenakshi
Ganguly, the south Asia director at Human Rights Watch. "[Instead of
doing the hard work -- **reforming** the criminal justice system,
enabling police to identify criminals and protecting victims --
political leaders somehow believe that threatening criminals with
hangings will deter them." **The inspiration** for both countries? **The
Philippines**, which]{.underline}, since President Rodrigo Duterte was
elected in 2016, [has embarked on [an incredibly violent war on
drugs](https://www.equaltimes.org/the-international-people-s#.XRM7zvZFw2x)
that has resulted in an estimated 20,000 deaths. The first sign that
other countries would **mimic his tactics** came in]{.underline}
neighbouring [Indonesia]{.underline}, which saw two rounds of
drug-executions followed by a stark rise in extrajudicial killings by
narcotics police in 2017 after [President]{.underline} Joko 'Jokowi'
[Widodo called drugs [Indonesia's "number one
problem"](https://en.antaranews.com/news/103320/drug-abuse-is-number-one-problem-in-indonesia-president).
Recent events in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have raised fears
that]{.underline} the use of [state-sanctioned violence
against]{.underline} alleged [drug criminals could be **spreading to
south Asia** where it would have a **hugely detrimental** impact on
**human rights** and the **rule of law**]{.underline}. "It's horrifying
to see that [some governments have **chosen to emulate** Duterte's
actions]{.underline}," says Omar Waraich, deputy south Asia director at
Amnesty International. "[**Like him**, they are desperately trying to
appear tough to the public, claiming that they have a **quick solution**
to establish law and order]{.underline}." The Duterte factor There is
evidence that the [use and availability of addictive narcotics is
increasing across Asia.]{.underline} In southern Thailand, the use of
crystal methamphetamine has been rising, making addiction the top cause
of divorce in the region. In China, the official number of drug users
has risen from 150,000 in 1991 to 2.5 million in 2017. And seizures of
meth tablets and crystal meth have risen dramatically in south-east Asia
over the past decade, according to the [United Nations Office on Drugs
and Crime
(UNODC).](https://www.unodc.org/documents/southeastasiaandpacific/Publications/2019/2019_The_Challenge_of_Synthetic_Drugs_in_East_and_SEA.pdf)
[This increase is driving]{.underline} the sudden [interest in populist,
anti-drug policies]{.underline}. "Communities are often upset that the
wide availability of illegal recreational drugs has led to addiction
problems and they want the state to take action," says Ganguly. The
Philippines was also dealing with this challenge, and there were reports
of growing meth usage in parts of major cities such as Manila and Cebu.
Duterte's 2016 presidential campaign hinged on his success in reducing
crime and drug usage while mayor of Davao City, where he debuted his
now-infamous tactics, such as [ordering the use of death
squads.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/02/philippines-president-duterte-drugs-war-death-squads)
[There is a **direct connection** between Duterte's rise and the spread
of violent anti-drugs tactics in Asia. Both Bangladesh and Sri Lankan
authorities have **expressed admiration** for Duterte's
methods]{.underline}. In fact, Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena
announced his desire to resume use of the death penalty after visiting
the Philippines and [calling what he saw there ["**an example to the
world**"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/18/example-to-the-world-sri-lanka-president-plans-to-copy-dutertes-war-on-drugs)]{.underline}.
In Bangladesh, there are clear parallels between the rhetoric of Prime
Minister Hasina and Duterte. Ignorance about drugs, and how to address
their social impacts, allows this rhetoric to take hold. "[It has been
easy for political leaders to simplify the ills of their society by
blaming them on drugs]{.underline}, due largely to the fact that
understanding about drugs is not based on evidence and science but on
morality, ideology and fallacies," says Gloria Lai, regional director
for Asia at the International Drug Policy Consortium. In fact, [the
effectiveness of Duterte's contentious
efforts](https://www.equaltimes.org/the-war-on-drugs-is-ineffective#.XRM_9_ZFw2x)
to reduce drug usage or availability is yet to be proven. The price of
meth remains similar to what it was before Duterte took power, and
reliable figures on drug usage are inconclusive; meanwhile evidence of
police brutality and abuse of power is plentiful. "[Duterte's murderous
ways have **not** rid the Philippines of drugs]{.underline}," Waraich
tells Equal Times. "In their own operations, [the police have planted
evidence in people's homes, faked official incident reports and stolen
possessions from people's homes."]{.underline} A war on the poor and
marginalised Thailand provides another worrying example. While not as
deadly as the Philippines, Thailand embarked on a war on drugs in the
early 2000s, putting tens of thousands of people in jail. Today, more
about [70 percent of the country's prison
population](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-drugs-thailand-prisons/soaring-prison-population-prompts-thailand-to-re-think-lost-drug-war-idUSKCN0ZX01J)
has been interned on drug offenses, yet drug use and availability
remains high. This falls in line with data from the United States, where
narcotics use remains high despite years of harsh anti-drug tactics.
Moreover, [several
studies](https://theconversation.com/theres-no-evidence-that-death-penalty-is-a-deterrent-against-crime-43227)
have shown that the [use of the death penalty]{.underline} as a
deterrent against the trade and usage of narcotics in fact [does very
little to reduce crime]{.underline}. "The death penalty is a simplistic
measure to deceive people into thinking that the government is taking
serious action," says Lai. Also, incredibly worrying to human rights
observers is evidence that the [victims of both extrajudicial killings
and the death penalty tend to be those from **poor** and]{.underline}/or
[**marginalised** communities, not necessarily the]{.underline} people
who run [criminal]{.underline} networks. The **[lack of
accountability]{.underline}** for police [means that the dead can
include victims unconnected to drug use]{.underline}, such as the 2017
killing of 17-year old [Kian Loyd de los
Santos](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/26/world/asia/philippines-teenager-killing-funeral-duterte.html),
or political opponents, as more than 10 of the victims in Bangladesh are
activists for the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
"Breaking the very laws they are supposed to uphold, the [authorities
have acted on the flimsiest evidence]{.underline} to target people
suspected of buying or selling drugs, often in poor neighborhoods," says
Waraich. Despite all the evidence[, there is little momentum to switch
from tactics rooted in violence]{.underline} and force [to one more
rooted in public health: "It's **political symbolism**]{.underline} at
the expense of not just individuals but also communities and societies,
because instead of investing in effectively tackling social problems,
such governments have simply chosen to distract voters," says Lai. If
the goal is political, then the war on drugs has been successful, at
least for its leaders. In the Philippines Duterte remains one of the
most popular politicians in Asia. Similarly, in Indonesia, Jokowi has
seen a jump in his popularity ratings after each round of drug
executions, and has seen no blowback from the rise in extrajudicial
killings. "Jokowi has been using, as much as possible, public issues
that could be exploited on a populist platform, and one of those is
drugs," says Ricky Gunawan, an Indonesian human rights lawyer and
director of the Community Legal Aid Institute (LBH Masyarakat), based in
Jakarta, Indonesia. In Bangladesh, the same trick has also worked well.
Prime Minister Hasina's Awami League party won elections in December
2018 convincingly, taking 288 out of 300 seats in Parliament, despite
numerous allegations of fraud. In the Philippines, Duterte's allies won
a majority in mid-term elections for 12 seats in the Senate. [As long as
voters keep supporting]{.underline} politicians who put [populist
policies ahead of human rights, it is likely that the war on drugs will
**continue** to claim **more victims** across Asia.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales to the Philippines are a product of American [imperialism]{.underline} -- the idea of 'military cooperation' is [interventionist violence]{.underline}.

Under [the Tydings-McDuffie law which created the Philippine
Commonwealth]{.underline}, the war-devastated Philippines was granted
formal independence. But certain conditions [defined the limits of
nominal sovereignty.]{.underline} The first condition required the
Philippine Congress to accept the terms of the 1946 Philippine Trade Act
which provided some rehabilitation money to repair the war-damaged
economy. More crucially, [the Act required an amendment to the
Philippine Constitution that gave U.S. citizens equal rights in the
exploitation of natural resources and ownership of public utilities and
other businesses.]{.underline} In effect, [the **colonizers retained
their old privileged status**.]{.underline} What was more decisive was
the revival of the oligarchy\'s sugar industry via tariff allowances and
quotas, the abrogation of control over import tariffs on U.S. goods,
prohibition of interference with foreign exchange (pegging the local
currency to the dollar), and unlimited remittance of profits for U.S.
corporations. Free trade guaranteed the status of the former possession
as a market for finished commodities and investments as well as a source
of cheap agricultural products and raw materials. The Act was rammed
through Congress by expelling left-wing legislators in line with the
CIA-directed military campaign against the Huks (Woddis 1967, 38-40).
[The second condition was the approval of the 1947 U.S.-Philippines
Treaty of General Relations which empowered the U.S. to exercise supreme
authority over extensive military bases. It also guaranteed the property
rights of U.S. corporations and citizens]{.underline}, thus
[**nullifying the sovereignty of the new** republic. This was followed
by]{.underline} the 1947 Military Bases Agreement that guaranteed the
[U.S. occupation of extensive military bases for 99 years.]{.underline}
This included the two major facilities, Clark Air Base and Subic Naval
Base, used as strategic springboards for intervention in Asia and the
Middle East during the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Iraq wars. The
Agreement also prohibited the Philippines from granting
extra-territorial rights to any other country, and placed no
restrictions on the uses to which the bases can be harnessed, nor the
types of weapons that can be deployed in them (Labor Research
Association 1958). [To reinforce its political and military ascendancy,
the U.S. also imposed the 1947 U.S.-Philippines Military Assistance Pact
to provide military assistance]{.underline}. Together [with this, a US
military advisory group]{.underline} (JUSMAG) was assigned to the
Philipine armed forces that [would exercise direct control by
supervising staff planning, intelligence personnel training and
logistics]{.underline}. All military hardware and financial backing must
be cleared through JUSMAG. Meanwhile, the US AID Public Safety Division
managed the tutelage of local police agencies[. US-supplied weapons,
training and logistics were immediately used in the counter-insurgency
campaign]{.underline} against the Huks in the early fifties, [and later
on, to support the parasitic elite and Marcos\' authoritarian
regime]{.underline} in the sixties, seventies and eighties. In a
revealing testimony to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee in
1969[, Lt. General Robert Warren clarified the role of the U.S.
military]{.underline} in the Philppines: \"\"[To provide advice and
assistance to]{.underline} the Armed Forces of [the
Philippines]{.underline} in the form of training material and services
[as necessary to assure **protection of US interests**]{.underline} in
the Philippines [and to **promote US foreign policy
objectives**]{.underline} in the area[\"]{.underline} (US Senate 1969,
242). In 1954, the terms of free trade that worsened Philippine
dependency were modified in the 1954 Laurel-Langley Trade Agreement
which extended parity rights to Americans for all kinds of enterprises.
Tariff rules were readjusted, thus shifting U.S. leverage to direct
private investments into manufacturing instead of raw material
production. Due to import controls imposed by the Philippines, the U.S.
established assembly and packaging plants to produce consumer goods,
thus competing with local industries. This was the refinement of the
elaborate apparatus of the multinational or transnational corporations
that would dominate post-World War II international trade. Meanwhile,
[the Philippine economy continued to rely on the U.S.]{.underline} for
selling raw materials and buying more expensive technology. In 1970, the
U.S. controlled 80% of foreign investments in the country, approximately
one-third of all the total equity capital of the 900 largest
corporations. This represented 60% of U.S. investments in south-east
Asia at that time (Bayani 1976, 18). Crisis of the Neocolonial Order At
the height of the Cold War, with the U.S. bogged down in the IndoChina
war[, the Philippines underwent **severe economic and social blockages**
that destabilized the Marcos regime, an instrument of U.S.]{.underline}
Cold War strategy but an ironic comment on the role of the Philippines
as a traditional showcase for democracy and freedom in Asia. Marcos
dispatched 2,000 troops to Vietnam at the request of Washington. But his
economic base had been deteriorating since he won the presidency in the
sixties. Intense foreign stranglehold of the economy led to unchecked
flow of capital, acute inflation, devaluation and rise of external debt.
Exchange control was lifted in 1962, leading to capital outflow:
repatriation of profits exceeded overseas investment. The overdependence
on basic exports\--lumber, sugar, copper, coconuts, and other extracted
products\--of low value relative to imported finished goods led to a
trade deficit of \$302 million in 1969 (Fast 1973, 89). In addition, the
failure of the \"Green Revolution\" and the alleged \"miracle rice\"
varieties (developed by the Rockefeller-funded International Rice
Research Institute) aggravated the chronic shortage of rice as staple
food, renewing the specter of famine and unrest. Meanwhile, the social
contradictions between the oligarchic state and the majority of
pauperized peasants sharpened. Although the Huks (renamed People\'s Army
of Liberation) were violently suppressed by the CIA-backed Magsaysay
regime in the fifties, they enjoyed popular support in the extremely
polarized countryside. Crippled by the arrest of its leaders in 1950,
the Huks evolved into the New People\'s Army (NPA) when the Communist
Party was reorganized in 1969 by Maoist partisans who matured during the
resurgence of the nationalist, anti-imperialist movement evinced in
massive student demonstrations, peasant and workers\' strikes, and
agitation among professionals such as teachers, journalists, lay and
religious workers, women, urban poor, and so on. One of Marcos\'
justifications for declaring martial law in 1972 was the threat of a
communist takeover. In actuality, it was an outgrowth of Cold War
geopolitics and US attempt to re-assert its hegemony in Asia after its
Vietnam debacle. [Increased U.S. military and political support for the
Marcos dictatorship was insured when Marcos\' guaranteed American
business 100% profit remittance as well as opportunities to exploit the
country\'s natural resources, and also engage in banking, shipping,
domestic fishing, and so on]{.underline} (Javate-De Dios, Daroy and
Tirol 1988). Later investigations revealed that the [bulk of U.S. aid
ended up in the foreign bank accounts of the Marcos family and their
sycophantic cronies]{.underline} (Bonner 1987). Total [US military aid
for the Marcos regime exceeded all those given to Africa or to those for
Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, or Chile. Napalm and fragmentation
bombs]{.underline}, among others, [were supplied]{.underline} through
JUSMAG to be used against NPA and Moro insurgents in Mindanao fighting
the dictatorship. [US AID officials trained police in advanced
techniques of riot control, interrogation, and torture tactics applied
to political prisoners and detained suspects.]{.underline} US \"Special
Forces\" were also directly involved in counterinsurgency operations
disguised as civic action activities, operations which are still
maintained under the terms of the VFA and, more recently, under those of
EDCA. These two [agreements]{.underline} have virtually **[legitimized
the return of U.S. troops despite the dismantling of all U.S.
bases]{.underline}** in 1992. One can conclude that [\"US imperialism,
with its economic and military stake in the Philippines, is the
instigator and mastermind of the Marcos fascist
dictatorship]{.underline}\" (Bayani 1976, 38). [And it continues to
mastermind the human-rights violations, extrajudicial killings and
torture]{.underline}, of the succeeding administrations, from those of
Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos to Joseph Estrada, Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo, and Benigno Aquino III. Aftermath of the 1986 February
Revolution President Corazon Aquino\'s regime (1986-1990) was marked by
the 1987 massacre of 18 farmers in a peaceful demonstration and by
numerous human rights violations through hamletting, \"salvaging\"
(extra-judicial killings), torture, etc. (Maglipon 1987). Both Aquino
and her successor, General Fidel Ramos, had the approval of Washington
in maintaining a stable market for business and U.S. geopolitical
maneuvers in the Middle East. After Ramos, both Presidents Joseph
Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo pursued the \"Washington Consensus\"
of abiding by the structural conditionalities of the World
Bank-International Monetary Fund in its neoliberal program of
deregulation, privatization and dismantling of any large-scale
social-service programs for the impoverished and marginalized majority
of citizens (Eadie 2005; San Juan 2008). All land-reform programs
initiated since 1946 have failed to resolve the age-old problem of
landless farmers and iniquitous semi-feudal relatons between landlords
and rural workers (Putzel 1992). In 1992, the Philippine Senate voted to
dismantle the U.S. military bases, but did not touch the other
Agreements that maintained U.S. supervision of the military and police
agencies. The end of the Cold [War did not witness a decrease in U.S.
military intervention]{.underline}. In 2002, after the 9/11 Al Qaida
attacks, the US State Dept declared the Philippines to be the second
front in the war against global terrorism (Tuazon et al, 2002) and so
required special supervision and surveillance. Secretary of State Powell
categorized the Communist Party of the Philippines and the NPA as
terrorist organizations (Fletcher 2013). While the major Moro groups,
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), were not stigmatized as terrorist, the U.S.
singled out the Abu Sayyaf splinter group as a reason for justifying the
1999 VFA and the 2002 Mutual Logistics Support Agreement that allowed
the initial troop deployment of 600 Special Operations forces to assist
the Philippine military in counter-insurgency operations. The killing of
a Filipino transgender in October 2014 by US Marine Private Joseph Scott
Pemberton called attention once again to the impunity of U.S. personnel
in numerous criminal cases. The VFA gives extra-territorial and
extra-judicial rights to visiting American troops, an exceptional
condition banned by the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Thus the
Philippines could not detain the suspected killer, undermining its
national sovereignty and its system of justice (Ayroso 2014). Meanwhile
the MILF is in the process of negotiating a peace agreement with
President Aquino under the auspices of the U.S. Institute of Peace and
the Malaysian government, while the MNLF has fragmented into various
camps since the 1996 accord with the government, a conclusion to the
1976 Tripoli Agreement between the MNLF and Marcos (Graf, Kreuzer and
Werning 2009). The government\'s dialogue with the National Democratic
Front-Philippines remains frozen while the Aquino regime is plagued with
corruption, disaster relief, energy shortages, and the stalemate with
China over the Scarborough Shoal and Spratley Islands confrontation in
which the U.S. Navy and Air Force presence figure prominently (Heydarian
2013). From Cold War to War on Terror Since 2002, the joint annual
military exercises called \"Philippine-US Bilateral Exercises\" have
been held allegedly to give humanitarian assistance during natural
disasters to victimized provinces. They also offer weapons, logistics
and other support to the government campaigns to secure peace and order
in war zones, or in vital metropolitan areas (as in the 2012 exercise
around the National Capitol Region). Just like the Civic Action programs
refined during the anti-Huk drives of the fifties, these exercises
supplement violent repression with psywar and other unconventional
techniques to win \"hearts and minds,\" closely following the U.S.
Counterinsurgency Guide of 2009 and its associated field manuals.
President Arroyo\'s Oplan Bantay Laya and President Benigno Aquino\'s
Oplan Bayanihan are updated versions of the counterinsurgency strategy
and tactics applied by the U.S. in Vietnam, El Salvador, Iraq,
Afghanistan, and elsewhere. They combine intensive military operations,
intelligence and civic action or triad operations, conventional warfare
methods, and counterguerilla tactics. The U.S. learned as much from its
tutelage of its colonial subjects as Filipinos did through a
cross-fertilization of security and espionage practices. The historian
Alfred McCoy concludes his inventory of such practices with the remark:
\"Empire has been a reciprocal process, shaping state formation in
Manila and Washington while moving both nations into a mutually
implicated postcolonial world\" (2009, 522). The 1951 Mutual Defense
Treaty continues to legitimize U.S. \"low intensity warfare,\" such as
the sustained anti-NPA drives during President Corazon Aquino\'s tenure
(Bello 1989). During the Arroyo presidency, the U.S. maintained official
headquarters of the U.S.-Philippine Joint Special Operations Task Force
Philippines (JSOTF-P) inside the Camp Navarro of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines\' Western Mindanao Comnmand in Zamboanga City where Moro
insurgents are active. Drones and other sophisticated equipment are
handled by U.S. Special Forces against the Abu Sayyaf now valorized as
an Al Qaida offshoot, with linkages to other recent terrorist groups
such as the Jemaah Islamiyah and the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. To
supplement JUSMAG, a new agency called Defense Policy Board was created
to handle issues of international terrorism, maritime safety,
transnational crime, natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, etc. Other
\"cooperative security locations\" (as these facilities are
euphemistically called) are found in Clark, Subic, Mactan International
Airport, and in other clandestine areas (Klare 2005). It is in these
areas occupied by U.S. advisers and staff where torture, enforced
disappearances, and extra-judicial killings occur. One recent case is
that of American health worker Melissa Roxas who was kidnapped and
tortured by military agents in 2009. Documenting the accelerated
kidnappings and extra-judicial murders of activists already publicized
by Amnesty International and UN rapporteurs such as Philip Alston, the
Filipino group KARAPATAN noted the 1,111 percent increase of military
assistance to the Arroyo regime beginning 2001 when the first Balikatan
exercise was held (Lefebvre 2010). This aid continues indiscrimiinately
with horrendous consequences. Provisional Coda In March 2007, the
Permanent People\'s Tribunal based in Europe heard witnesses about
government abuses and judged Presidents Bush and Arroyo guilty of crimes
against humanity\" (San Juan 2007, Appendix C). The verdict reviews [the
U.S. imposition of virtual colonial status on the Philippines via
numerous military and security agreements that **insured domination**
over the economy, State apparatus, and internal security.]{.underline}
Under the guise of the global \"war on terror\" against extremists, [the
U.S. continues to deploy and station thousands of troops, at any one
time, in the Philippines. They participate in combat operations against
local insurgents\--a gross violation of Philippine sovereignty and
territorial integrity]{.underline}. The Tribunal observed that \"because
of its strategic location, the Philippines is vital for the U.S.
projection of military force in East Asia and as far away as the Middle
East,\" serving as transit points and refueling stations in its wars of
aggression against the people of Afghanistan and of Iraq, as well as the
people of the Philippines. President Bush was an accomplice of President
Arroyo in the systematic violation of the rights of the Filipino people,
which are also crimes of humanity. U.S. mperialism was indicted as an
international scourge. From the sixteenth century to the present,
imperialism, whether in the mode of Spanish old-style colonialism,
Japanese militarism, and [U.S. tutelage in
modernization/developmentalism, **represents one of the worst
manifestations of an oppressive system of exploitation of
peoples**]{.underline} that have been outlawed by the United Nations
Charter and its Declaration of Human Rights. [Nonetheless, it persists
today in the Philippines where a people\'s national-democratic,
socialist-oriented revolution, with a long and durable tradition,
thrives in a collective project to eradicate this historic
legacy]{.underline} (San Juan 2008) [The history of the Philippines may
be read as one long chronicle of the people\'s struggle against
colonialism and imperialism for the sake of affirming human dignity and
universal justice.]{.underline}

Election meddling has raised increasing alarm in U.S. politics since the
election of Trump. Now, the same question racks the Philippines.
Recently, in a wash of election fraud, candidates backed by Philippine
President Rodrigo Duterte swept the country's Senate --- including
Ronald "Bato" Dela Rosa, former police chief and architect of Duterte's
drug war. Strangely, now that Duterte has seized control over every
branch of government, he's also become increasingly absent, resurfacing
questions of his health and stability to be president. But if there's
one thing that's clear from this election, it's this: [Duterte's
administration has proved itself **violent and corrupt once again,
worsening a human rights record** whose severity **has long merited an
end of U.S. support.**]{.underline} On top of rampant vote-buying,
evidence of dramatically increased voter fraud and suppression is
mounting. Over 10 times the number of vote counting machines
malfunctioned during this election compared to 2016. Voters who selected
opposition candidates discovered that their voter receipts showed that
their votes had been tallied for Duterte's slate instead. Some ballots
allegedly omitted progressive party lists altogether, while viral social
media posts falsely claimed that these had been "disqualified" for
"destabilizing the government." [**U.S. support has been critical to the
rise of Duterte's** military and police.]{.underline} After publicly
reporting 0.4 percent of precincts' results, the election commission's
servers suddenly shut down for seven hours. When they went back online,
over 90 percent of results were in, proclaiming that Duterte's picks had
won the Upper House. For his part, Duterte made a mockery of democracy,
commenting that vote-buying is "integral" and "there's no one who
doesn't buy votes." Then there's [the intimidation by the Philippine
armed forces, who increasingly function as Duterte's goons
---]{.underline} not only [through his infamous "drug war,"]{.underline}
but during the elections too. In Manila, uniformed police distributed
propaganda newsletters maligning and red-baiting progressive candidates,
a McCarthy-era tactic used not only to intimidate, but to target and
kill activists. Across the country, volunteers for the progressive
Makabayan bloc received death threats and voters were intimidated
through misinformation. Overseas, millions of overseas Filipinos have
been disenfranchised, and their votes left uncounted. One voter,
Dominico Vega, who has been organizing students at California State
University Northridge to lobby for a congressional hearing on the
Philippines, expressed: "The Philippines can feel so far from the San
Fernando Valley, but when friends and family become victims of Duterte's
human rights abuses, it hits close to home. Elections should not silence
us." Vega is right in his call for a congressional hearing on the
Philippines: U.S. support has been critical to the rise of Duterte's
military and police. [Duterte's regime is **the largest recipient of
U.S. military aid** in East and Southeast Asia. In 2018, the U.S.
sent]{.underline} over \$193.5 million in military aid to the Philippine
military and police, not including [arms sales,]{.underline} and donated
equipment of unreported value. [The U.S. helped inaugurate Duterte's
drug war, which has now claimed as many as 27,000 lives, by giving the
police]{.underline} \$32 million for [equipment]{.underline} and
training in "policing standards" [---]{.underline} clearly
[detrimental]{.underline} when it comes [to human rights.]{.underline}
Less publicized in the U.S[., Duterte has imposed martial law
on]{.underline} the island of [Mindana]{.underline}o since 2017.
[Increased militarization and bombings there, **backed by U.S. drones,
advisors, and special forces**, have caused the displacement of some
450,000 civilians. Philippine soldiers]{.underline} and paramilitaries
[are meanwhile committing atrocities against indigenous communities who
oppose the encroachments]{.underline} of logging and mining
conglomerates. [U.S. military aid, often through **secretive and
unaccountable conduits**]{.underline} in the name of the War on Terror[,
is only making this **internal conflict** and the]{.underline} overall
[human rights crisis worse. **U.S. military aid does not serve to defend
the Philippines**]{.underline} against invaders --- [rather, it is being
**turned against the vulnerable**]{.underline} and marginalized[, the
**journalists** **and human rights defenders, the dissenters.** History
has shown that when the U.S. has made geopolitical calculations at the
expense of people's human rights, that has only **fomented insecurity in
the form of utter collapse.** As the biggest military power]{.underline}
around the globe by far[, the U.S. should prioritize stopping support to
Duterte. **An overblown military presence in Asia Pacific only invites
an arms race with China**.]{.underline} We must stop relying on
militarization to ensure security. Last month, the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors condemned Duterte's human rights abuses and called for a
congressional hearing on the U.S. funds fueling the violations,
responding to the concerns of Filipino residents in the Bay area. Other
U.S. cities should do the same. But most of all, in solidarity with
movements for democracy, human rights, and social justice in the
Philippines, [Congress must **exercise its full powers of oversight** to
end the military aid and arms sales to Duterte's regime.]{.underline}

But epidemics are only one apocalyptic media darling. Over the last
decade, the twenty-four-hour news cycle and the proliferation of media
channels has created ever-more apocalyptic content that is readily
available to us, from images of the Twin Towers falling in 2001 to
images of the Japanese tsunami in 2011. So, too, have cable channels
like Discovery and History married advances in computer-generated
imagery with emerging scientific understanding of our planet and
universe to give visual validity to the rare and catastrophic events
that have occurred in the past or that may take place in the distant
future. [Using dramatic]{.underline}, animated [images and the language
of apocalypse to peddle such varied scenarios]{.underline}, however,
[has the effect of leveling the apocalyptic playing field, leaving the
viewer with the impression that terrorism, bird flu,]{.underline} global
[warming, and asteroids are all equally probable]{.underline}. But [not
all of these apocalyptic scenarios are equally likely]{.underline}, and
they\'re certainly not equally likely to occur within our lifetimes---or
in our neighborhoods. For example, after millions of Americans witnessed
the attacks of 9/11 on television, our collective fear of terrorism was
much higher than its actual probability; in 2001, terrorists killed
one-twelfth as many Americans as did the flu and one-fifteenth as many
Americans as did car accidents.9 Throughout the first decade of the
twenty-first century, the odds of an American being killed by a
terrorist were about 1 in 88,000---compared to a 1 in 10,010 chance of
dying from falling off a ladder.10 The fears of an outbreak of SARS,
avian flu, or swine flu also never lived up to their media hype. [This
overreliance on the apocalyptic narrative causes us to fear the wrong
things and to mistakenly equate potential future events with current and
observable trends. How to discern the difference between so many
apocalyptic options ?]{.underline} If we ask ourselves three basic
questions about the many threats portrayed apocalyptically in the media,
we are able to separate the apocalyptic wheat from the chaff. Which
scenarios are probable? Which are preventable? And what is the likely
impact of the worst-case model of any given threat? In answering these
questions, it becomes clear that [much of what the media peddles as
apocalyptic is not]{.underline}. The [apocalyptic scenarios involving
global disaster]{.underline}---from meteor impacts to super-volcanic
eruptions---[are]{.underline} extraordinarily [rare]{.underline}. An
[asteroid]{.underline} could hit the Earth and lead to the extinction of
all mammals, including us, but the [geologic record tells
us]{.underline} that such massive [strikes are unlikely]{.underline},
[and logic tells us that there is little we can do to prevent one. Nor
are terrorist attacks or an outbreak of avian flu likely to destroy
humanity; their impact is relatively small and usually localized,
because we can be prepared for such threats and can contain and mitigate
their effects]{.underline}. [The apocalyptic storyline tells us that
most of these events are probable]{.underline}, largely unpreventable,
[and destined to be catastrophic. But none of this is
true]{.underline}---[their probability is]{.underline} either
[low]{.underline} or can be made lower through preventive means, or
their impact is containable. (The degree of damage caused by Hur-ricane
Katrina, for example, could have been minimized through better
preparation both in infrastructure and in the government\'s response.
Yet even without such preparations, the impact remained relatively
localized.) [The danger of the media\'s conflation of apocalyptic
scenarios is that it leads us to believe that our existential threats
come exclusively from events that]{.underline} are beyond our control
and that [await us in the future]{.underline}---and that a moment of
universal recognition of such threats will be obvious to everyone when
they arrive. No one, after all, would ever confuse a meteor barreling
toward Earth as anything other than apocalyptic. Yet [tangled up in such
Hollywood scenarios and sci-fi nightmares are actual threats that
aren\'t arriving in an instant of universal recognition; instead, they
are arriving amid much denial and continued partisan
debate]{.underline}. For example, annual climate-related disasters such
as droughts, storms, and floods rose dramatically during the Apocalyptic
Decade, increasing an average 75 percent compared to the 1990s---just as
many climate models predicted they would if global warming were left
unchecked.11 Yet this [rise in natural disasters hasn\'t produced a
moment of universal recognition of the dangers of climate change;
instead, belief in climate change is actually on the decline as we
adjust to the \"new normal\" of ever-weirder weather or convince
ourselves that our perception of this increased frequency is a
magnifying trick of more readily available cable and Internet
coverage]{.underline}. Despite the media\'s best efforts to conflate
them with improbable scenarios, [the]{.underline} existential
[challenges]{.underline} that [we must confront]{.underline} in the
twenty-first century don\'t fit into the apocalyptic storyline of future
cataclysmic events that are beyond our control---because they **[aren\'t
truly events but rather are trends]{.underline}**. [Whether or not we
will be able to control them hinges on our understanding that the moment
of revelation doesn\'t lie before us in some indeterminate
future]{.underline}---**[it is already here]{.underline}**.

(CNN) \-- At a security conference recently, the moderator asked the
panel of distinguished cybersecurity leaders what their nightmare
scenario was. The answers were the predictable array of large-scale
attacks: against our communications infrastructure, against the power
grid, against the financial system, in combination with a physical
attack. I didn\'t get to give my answer until the afternoon, which was:
\"[My nightmare scenario is that people keep talking about their
nightmare scenarios.\"]{.underline} [There\'s a certain **blindness that
comes from worst-case thinking**]{.underline}. An extension of the
precautionary principle, [it involves imagining the worst possible
outcome and then acting as if it were a certainty. It **substitutes
imagination for thinking**]{.underline}, **[speculation for risk
analysis]{.underline}** and **[fear for reason]{.underline}**. [It
**fosters powerlessness and vulnerability** and **magnifies social
paralysis**]{.underline}. And [it makes us **more vulnerable to the
effects of terrorism.**]{.underline} [Worst-case thinking means
**generally bad decision making** for several reasons]{.underline}.
First, [it\'s only half of the cost-benefit equation. Every decision has
costs and benefits, risks and rewards. By speculating about what can
possibly go wrong, and then acting as if that is likely to
happen,]{.underline} **[worst-case thinking focuses only on the extreme
but improbable risks and does a poor job at assessing
outcomes]{.underline}**. Second, [it\'s based on **flawed logic**. It
begs the question by assuming that a proponent of an action must prove
that the nightmare scenario is impossible]{.underline}. Third, [it **can
be used to support any position or its opposite**]{.underline}. [If we
build a nuclear power plant, it could melt down. If we don\'t build it,
we will run short of power and society will collapse into
anarchy]{.underline}. If we allow flights near Iceland\'s volcanic ash,
planes will crash and people will die. If we don\'t, organs won\'t
arrive in time for transplant operations and people will die. [If we
don\'t invade Iraq, Saddam Hussein might use the nuclear weapons he
might have. If we do, we might destabilize the Middle East, leading to
widespread violence and death]{.underline}. Of course**[, not all fears
are equal]{.underline}**. [Those that we tend to exaggerate are more
easily justified by worst-case thinking.]{.underline} So [terrorism
fears trump privacy fears]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} almost
[everything else]{.underline}; [technology is hard to understand and
therefore scary]{.underline}; [nuclear weapons are worse than
conventional weapons;]{.underline} [our children need to be protected at
all costs]{.underline}; [and annihilating the planet is
bad]{.underline}. Basically, **[any fear that would make a good movie
plot is amenable to worst-case thinking.]{.underline}** Fourth and
finally, [worst-case thinking **validates ignorance**]{.underline}.
[Instead of focusing on what we know, it focuses on what we don\'t know
\-- and what we can imagine]{.underline}. [Remember]{.underline} Defense
Secretary Donald [Rumsfeld\'s quote]{.underline}? \"Reports that say
that something hasn\'t happened are always interesting to me, because as
we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We
also know [there are known unknowns]{.underline}; that is to say we know
there are some things we do not know. But [there are also unknown
unknowns]{.underline} \-- the ones we don\'t know we don\'t know.\" And
this: \"[the absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence]{.underline}.\" [Ignorance **isn\'t a cause for
doubt**]{.underline}; [when you can fill that ignorance with
imagination, it can be a call to action]{.underline}. Even worse, [it
can lead to hasty and dangerous acts]{.underline}. [You can\'t wait for
a smoking gun, so you act as if the gun is about to go off]{.underline}.
Rather than making us safer, **[worst-case thinking has the potential to
cause dangerous escalation]{.underline}**. [The new undercurrent in this
is that our society no longer has the ability to calculate
probabilities. Risk assessment is devalued]{.underline}.
**[Probabilistic thinking is repudiated in favor of \"possibilistic
thinking\":]{.underline}** [Since we can\'t know what\'s likely to go
wrong, let\'s speculate about what can possibly go wrong.]{.underline}
**[Worst-case thinking leads to bad decisions, bad systems design, and
bad security]{.underline}**. And we all have direct experience with its
effects: airline security and the TSA, which we make fun of when we\'re
not appalled that they\'re harassing 93-year-old women or keeping
first-graders off airplanes. **[You can\'t be too careful! Actually, you
can.]{.underline}** You can refuse to fly because of the possibility of
plane crashes. You can lock your children in the house because of the
possibility of child predators. You can eschew all contact with people
because of the possibility of hurt. Steven Hawking wants to avoid trying
to communicate with aliens because they might be hostile; does he want
to turn off all the planet\'s television broadcasts because they\'re
radiating into space? It isn\'t hard to parody worst-case thinking, and
at its extreme it\'s a psychological condition. Frank
[Furedi]{.underline}, a sociology professor at the University of Kent,
[writes: \"Worst-case thinking encourages society to **adopt fear as one
of the dominant principles** around which the public, the government and
institutions should organize their life. It **institutionalizes
insecurity and fosters a mood of confusion and
powerlessness**]{.underline}. [Through popularizing the belief that
worst cases are normal]{.underline}, [it incites people to feel
defenseless and vulnerable to a wide range of future
threats.\"]{.underline} Even worse, **[it plays directly into the hands
of terrorists]{.underline}**, creating a population that is easily
terrorized \-- even by failed terrorist attacks like the Christmas Day
underwear bomber and the Times Square SUV bomber. **[When someone is
proposing a change, the onus should be on them to justify it over the
status quo.]{.underline}** But **[worst case thinking is a way of
looking at the world that exaggerates the rare and unusual and gives the
rare much more credence than it deserves]{.underline}**. It isn\'t
really a principle; [it\'s a cheap trick to justify what you already
believe. It lets lazy or biased people make what seem to be cogent
arguments without understanding the whole issue. And **when people
don\'t need to refute counterarguments, there\'s no point in listening
to them.**]{.underline}

#### Second -- put away your disads

#### The drug war forces the reallocation of the country's resources

Impact on local politics and government[. Duterte's almost singular
focus on the drug war has far-reaching consequences for the country's
local politics and governance.]{.underline} In many respects,
subnational government in the Philippines is highly decentralized, but
most local government units (LGUs) are dependent upon central government
funding and grapple with the challenge of unfunded mandates**[. LGUs are
key actors in the drug war, and local officials need to juggle multiple
and sometimes conflicting priorities, including protecting their
citizens, cooperating with local law enforcement, and demonstrating
results to central authorities.]{.underline}** And as reported by
Rappler, a respected Philippine news website, the drug war has caused a
major shift in LGU priorities: At the local level, the [drug war has
changed the way barangays \[the smallest LGUs\] spend their
funds]{.underline}. . . . **[Traditional social services such as medical
clinics or feeding programs for malnourished children are no longer
budget priorities]{.underline}**. Through a number of policy incentives
as well as strict supervision by the DILG, the priority at the barangay
level has now become the monitoring and surveillance of drug suspects
and the rehabilitation of drug users who have surrendered. There also is
a darker dimension to the drug war at the local level. Peter Kreuzer
notes the pressure and intimidation experienced by local officials: It
has become [highly problematic for local political elites to evade the
president's injunction to participate in the anti-crime killing spree
that is engulfing the Philippines]{.underline}. . . . The various
reshuffles are placing more hard-line police officers in command
positions. Furthermore, these officers are well aware that results
measured in dead bodies are expected of them. In addition, **[police
officers and politicians alike have been publicly denounced as
supporting and profiting from drug crimes and thus threatened not only
with being indicted]{.underline}**, but also with becoming victims of
extrajudicial executions themselves. Most officials then choose to fall
in line with the president.43

#### No China fill-in -- SCS, drilling, and Scarborough Shoal have incentivized Philippines to move away from China towards the US.

Behind the diplomatic niceties, [Manila has been **fretting**
over]{.underline} Beijing's continued militarization of the
[S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [**disputes**.
Duterte's frustrations were made clear in August when,]{.underline} in a
remarkable departure from his usual China-friendly language, [[he called
on
Beijing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-08-15/duterte-says-china-should-temper-its-behavior-in-south-china-sea-video)
to "**temper" its behavior** and cease harassing Philippine surveillance
missions in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea. [Duterte reminded China that Filipino troops "do not
need any permission]{.underline} to sail through the open seas" [and
that "the\[ir\] right of innocent passage is guaranteed]{.underline}"
under international law. A week later, [[he
warned](https://globalnation.inquirer.net/169226/duterte-china-dont-drill-oil-ph-sea)
China of **open conflict** if the latter unilaterally drilled in
Philippine waters, threatening,]{.underline} with characteristic
braggadocio, [that he would send security forces to "machete
there]{.underline} and cut down the Chinese." [This echoed the ["three
redlines"](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/05/29/1819745/philippines-china-draw-red-lines-south-china-sea-dispute)
the Philippine government issued in May, when it warned]{.underline}
that Chinese reclamation at [Scarborough Shoal]{.underline}, unilateral
[exploitation of energ]{.underline}y resources, [or coercive
actions]{.underline} against Filipino troops in the South China Sea
[would irreversibly torpedo **bilateral relations**. The Philippines has
also been frustrated by China's failure,]{.underline} so far, [to
actualize]{.underline} its earlier [promises of huge economic
investments]{.underline}, with Zhao Jianhua, the Chinese ambassador to
the Philippines, [reportedly
blocking](http://politics.com.ph/blackmail-overstaying-chinese-ambassador-blocking-loans-grants-to-ph-until-duterte-signs-wps-joint-oil-deal/)
big-ticket projects amid disagreements over a resource-sharing agreement
in the South China Sea. [It is **against this backdrop** of growing
disillusionment with China that the Philippine military has been
fortifying **defense cooperation** with Washington]{.underline}. In
late-September, [Philippine defense secretary]{.underline} Delfin
Lorenzana [[held high-level
dialogue](https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/09/20/lorenzana-meets-with-pompeo-in-washington/)s
with]{.underline} U.S. secretary of defense James [Mattis]{.underline}
and secretary of state Mike Pompeo [as part of efforts to **strengthen
the alliance**, enhance military **interoperability**, and
aid]{.underline} the Armed Forces of the Philippines' [modernization.
The Philippines is [expected to be the biggest
beneficiary](http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1046328) of]{.underline}
Washington's newly-announced \$300 million in [F]{.underline}oreign
[M]{.underline}ilitary [F]{.underline}inancing [for the Indo-Pacific
region]{.underline}. A week later, Admiral Philip Davidson, commander of
the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, visited the Philippines and met senior
military [officials]{.underline} [who [agreed
to]{.underline}](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/669522/phl-us-to-increase-number-of-joint-military-exercises-in-2019-afp/story/)
[expand the number of annual joint exercises]{.underline} from 261 to
281, with a greater focus on maritime security. This year also saw the
return of [joint war
games](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/08/1858351/photos-philippines-us-troops-hold-amphibious-landing-exercise-kamandag)
in the South China Sea, including the simulation of island defense
drills during the Philippine-U.S. Kamandag exercises in October, which
also included Japanese forces. [There was also a 60 percent
increase](https://thediplomat.com/2018/05/what-does-a-bigger-2018-balikatan-military-exercise-say-about-us-philippines-alliance-under-duterte/)
in the number of U.S. and Philippine troops participating in the annual
Balikatan exercises earlier this year, underscoring the restoration of
defense cooperation between the two allies. The [revival in
Philippine-U.S. defense cooperation reflects the broader shift in
**regional geopolitical attitudes**, as China's **rising influence** and
untrammeled **maritime assertiveness** inspires a more robust
**pushback** from likeminded countries.]{.underline}

#### No China or Russia fill-in -- the Philippines remains committed to their US relationship despite rhetoric.

But [is there a pivot away from the US in the first place? On the
ground, engagements by the Philippines in 2018 showed it is not moving
away from the US despite Duterte\'s rhetoric. While the Philippines has
China and Russia as its new buddies, the Philippines is **sticking it
out** with its old military ally, the US]{.underline}. Close ties [A
most striking example was a visit by]{.underline} top [Philippine
officials to Hawaii]{.underline} in May this year. In May, a Philippine
delegation led by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, one of
Duterte\'s most trusted men, [met with US Pacific Command chief Admiral
Harry Harris
Jr](https://www.rappler.com/nation/202932-philippines-officials-security-meeting-hawaii-us-pacific-command)
in Hawaii. Medialdea was accompanied by Defense Secretary Delfin
Lorenzana, Ambassador to Washington Jose Manuel Romualdez, then-Foreign
Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, then-Interior and Local Government
OIC-Secretary Eduardo Año, and then-Permanent Representative to the
United Nations Teodoro Locsin Jr. [It was a sign of the **importance**
attached by the Philippines to the US despite Duterte\'s anti-US
tirades.]{.underline} Months later, in December, [the commander
of]{.underline} what is now known as [the US Indo-Pacific
Command]{.underline}, Admiral Philip Davidson, [[met with Duterte and
Lorenzana]{.underline}](http://www.pacom.mil/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/1713051/us-indo-pacific-commander-admiral-davidson-visits-manila/)
in Manila. [The US also made key donations to the Philippine
military]{.underline} in August this year -- [4 OV-10B
planes](https://www.rappler.com/nation/208959-us-sending-ov-10-bronco-planes-philippines-anti-terror-campaign)
to help in the Philippines\' counterterrorism campaign, and
an[P807-million (\$15-million) surveillance and reconnaissance
system](https://www.rappler.com/nation/209552-us-gives-philippines-surveillance-system-august-2018).
This is on top of the [millions in US aid for conflict-stricken Marawi
City](https://www.rappler.com/nation/181195-united-states-donation-marawi-rehabilitation-relief)
in the southern Philippines. [The Philippines]{.underline}, too, [[is
set to receive]{.underline} the biggest chunk of [security
assistance]{.underline}](https://www.rappler.com/nation/210699-philippines-get-biggest-chunk-us-security-aid-indo-pacific-region)
from the US in the Indo-Pacific region, said Deputy Assistant Secretary
of State Walter Douglas, who visited the Philippines in August. \'We
only have one security alliance\' Clarita Carlos, a [political science
professor]{.underline} who specializes in defense and foreign policy,
[explained]{.underline} why the Philippines and the US maintain such
close ties despite [the Philippines]{.underline}\' new buddies. \"We
only [have one security alliance]{.underline}, and that is [with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates of America,\" Carlos said in an
interview with Rappler. Carlos referred to the 1951 [M]{.underline}utual
[D]{.underline}efense [T]{.underline}reaty between the Philippines and
the United States, where the two countries agreed to defend each other
in the case of an armed attack. This [is the Philippines\' only defense
treaty with another country]{.underline}. Advertisement The
Philippines\' [ties with other countries]{.underline}, Carlos pointed
out, \"[are really like just economic relationships, but nothing equals
the M]{.underline}utual [D]{.underline}efense [T]{.underline}reaty, [the
V]{.underline}isiting [F]{.underline}orces [A]{.underline}greement, [and
the E]{.underline}nhanced [D]{.underline}efense
[C]{.underline}ooperation [A]{.underline}greement.\" Carlos believes
that [Duterte **changed his mind** about America after
2016]{.underline}, when his anti-US rhetoric [included a military and
economic \"separation from the United
States.\"](https://www.rappler.com/nation/149806-duterte-announces-military-economic-split-from-us)
\"[He\'s **learning along the way**]{.underline}, and [while he might
have articulated an anti-American rhetoric at the start, I think he has
backpedaled from that]{.underline},\" Carlos said. \"He\'s learning
because [he\'s finding out the realpolitik on the ground]{.underline}.
And that\'s good. It\'s bad if at the start you already have something
in mind and you don\'t change your mind. [It\'s good that he\'s changing
his mind given the new realization of the security
environment]{.underline},\" she said. No pivot away from Washington
Carlos said [the Philippines is **not** pivoting away from the
US]{.underline}. \"No, I don\'t think we will do that. Independent
foreign policy simply means -- if Trump has an America First, [we also
have our **Philippines First**. Whichever will serve our interests, we
will go there,\"]{.underline} she said. Referring to Duterte, she added:
\"You will notice he will go to Latin America, he will go to the
Caribbean, he will go anywhere so long as they will buy our mangoes,
pineapples, et cetera. That\'s how pragmatic he is.\" For Carlos,
Duterte \"has done quite well because he has gone to other countries
which are nontraditional partners.\" In this aspect, 2018 was noteworthy
because of the [historic state visit of Chinese President Xi
Jinping](https://www.rappler.com/nation/216847-xi-jinping-philippine-visit-november-2018)
and the Philippines\' heightened engagements with Russia, including the
first time a Philippine Navy vessel [made a port call to
Vladivostok](https://www.rappler.com/nation/213276-philippine-navy-brp-tarlac-port-call-vladivostok-russia-october-2018).
Carlos said the Philippines stands to benefit from nontraditional
partners as well. One of the possible gains is in responding to
disasters. On the Chinese military, for example, Carlos said, \"Like us,
they are also confronted with earthquakes, landslides, typhoons. We have
the same disasters. And with them, because they have more advanced
technology, they can really help us.\" On Russian troops, she added,
\"Russia now is in the forefront of pivoting into Southeast Asia, and
that is good. And they also want to train with us, isn\'t it? They have
a defense attaché from Moscow.\" Warnings vs China, Russia But [experts
also warned **against** the Philippines\' **security arrangements with
China and Russia**.]{.underline} Military historian Jose Antonio
Custodio noted that [China is not an ally but actually a rival
in]{.underline} the West Philippine Sea or [S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea. He said [Russia on the other hand
is offering military equipment that the Philippines might **not be able
to maintain**. Custodio also noted the \"unauthorized or unmonitored\"
landing of Chinese planes in Davao]{.underline} City, hometown of
Duterte, in June this year. Custodio told Rappler: \"[The China
relationship is **not clearly defined** and hence is prone to being
taken advantage of by individuals within the Philippines]{.underline}
who want to curry favor with China. That\'s why you have unauthorized or
unmonitored Chinese entry into the Philipppines, like in the Port of
Davao.\" Advertisement \"So it becomes personalized now. It\'s a
dangerous precedent because protocol is not followed and protocol is set
up to protect our national interests also,\" Custodio said. He added, We
have to input here that [**China is not an ally**. It\'s]{.underline}
actually [a country we have a major territorial dispute
with]{.underline}.\" On Russia, [Custodio cautioned the Philippines
against buying Russian equipment]{.underline}. A US official [also
cautioned against
this](https://www.rappler.com/nation/209697-us-defense-randall-schriver-warning-philippines-buying-equipment-from-russia)
in August, [prompting another
outburst](https://www.rappler.com/nation/209811-duterte-reaction-warning-united-states-official-russian-equipment)
from Duterte. \"[Do we have the capacity to buy and maintain? That\'s
the big problem.]{.underline} So we will end up in a situation where we
can actually purchase Russian equipment, but in the long run [they will
not be properly maintained so you end up losing money]{.underline},\"
Custodio said. The Armed Forces of the Philippines, he said, should be
the last word on purchasing weapons. \"Hindi dapat manggagaling \'yan
from whatever Poncio Pilato (That decision should come from just any
Pontius Pilate).\" Custodio said purchasing \"small items\" from China
and Russia is fine, \"but not big-ticket items.\" \"Don\'t get it from
them because at the same time you have to take into consideration also
that [their actions are]{.underline} actually [aimed to
disrupt]{.underline} our own [long-standing alliance with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, so every decision that we make
must be evaluated by the National Security Council,\" Custodio said. The
[Philippines\' alliance system with the US]{.underline}, he explained,
\"[is our last card in fending off China\'s territorial
ambitions.\"]{.underline} Carlos also stressed the value of maintaining
ties with America. \"[You are part of the security alliance of the US in
Southeast Asia, with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.
Why, would you like to be in the sphere of China and
Russia?]{.underline} These are not democracies. Isn\'t that plain? We
are a democracy also.\" In an interview with ANC, US Ambassador to the
Philippines Sung Kim said, \"It is important to remember that we are the
only alliance you have, and [I don\'t think]{.underline} your [improving
relations with other countries, whether it\'s China or some other
country, would replace the alliance you have with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.\"

#### Arms sales don't stop terror in the Philippines -- political disagreements ensure continued conflict

Last week, authorities in Manila announced that Philippine troops had
killed Isnilon Hapilon, the deputy leader of the Abu Sayyaf Group and
apparent emir of the Islamic State in the Philippines, and Omar Maute,
one of the two brothers leading the Maute Group. Shortly after receiving
the news, President Rodrigo Duterte declared the city of Marawi
liberated from terrorist influence. The all-clear signal has not been
given yet, however. About 30 militants, including six to eight foreign
fighters, remain in the city and are continuing their fight against
Philippine troops. The militants are believed to have 20 hostages. What
started out as a hasty raid to capture Isnilon has turned into a
five-month siege. Since May, t[he Philippine military has been engaged
in combat operations against]{.underline} the Maute Group and Abu Sayyaf
--- both [Islamist militant groups]{.underline} that have pledged
loyalty to Islamic State. Nearly 750 militants have been killed, and 155
soldiers, marines, police, and 47 civilians have died. The fighting in
the city of Marawi has also displaced about 400,000 people. The violence
in Marawi spurred Duterte to declare martial law in the Southern
Philippines. [Many countries seem to think that more money, more arms,
and more specialized equipment for the Philippine military is the
appropriate response to the conflict in Marawi]{.underline}. [The United
States,]{.underline} Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and even
China [have offered varying levels of support to the
Philippines]{.underline}, ranging from assistance in intelligence and
technical expertise to rifles and bullets to mini-guns, grenade
launchers, drones, and specially equipped surveillance planes. [The
influx of arms and equipment will certainly increase the lethality of
the Philippine military, but on its own **it cannot prevent the growth
of Islamic State in the Southern Philippines**.]{.underline} These
resources are singularly focused on one tactical objective --- to bring
the crisis in Marawi to an end. However, [the crisis is not just about
recent clashes with Islamic State --- **it is a by-product of a nearly
five-decade political impasse**]{.underline} with several Moro (Filipino
Muslim) separatist groups. The inability of the various Moro groups to
agree on what constitutes self-determination and self-governance
continues to plague the Philippines and foster conflict. [Internal
strife and political disagreements amongst these Moro separatist groups
has fueled violence and furthered political and economic instability in
the Southern Philippines]{.underline}, particularly in the Autonomous
Region of Muslim Mindanao. The result has been under-governed areas and
a weak rule of law that has in the past enabled the separatist groups to
provide sanctuary to transnational terrorists, such as al-Qaeda and
Jemaah Islamiyah. The area continues to be the poorest region in the
Philippines, ranking in the bottom 10 out of 81 provinces for the past
two decades. In 2013, the U.S. State Department identified the
Sulu-Sulawasi Seas and the Southern Philippines as terrorist safe havens
in the Asia Pacific. [These conditions are precisely why Islamic State
seeks to establish a province in the Southern Philippines.]{.underline}

#### The U.S. doesn't need the Philippines.

**Bandow 16**(Doug, Senior Fellow @ CATO, JD @ Stanford, 10-18, "The
U.S. Doesn't Need the Philippines," New York Times,

[America]{.underline} is a curious great power. It [cowers before
international lightweights, begging the least significant nations to let
it defend them. Such as the Philippines.]{.underline} President Rodrigo
[Duterte has gained notoriety for the official murder of thousands of
drug users and dealers.]{.underline} He then publicly insulted President
Obama for criticizing this murderous policy. [**United States
credibility suffers** when a nation long subsidized and defended by
America shows such ostentatious disrespect]{.underline}. The [Philippine
president shouldn't be treated like a co-equal and ally if he doesn't
behave like one.]{.underline} Moreover, **[the Philippines needs America
far more than America needs the Philippines]{.underline}**. [Manila
spends less than 1 percent of its gross domestic product on its military
and its best ships are U.S. cast-offs. **It doesn't help defend the
United States from anyone.**]{.underline} Rather, [Manila expects
Washington's protection even though the archipelago matters little for
the United States]{.underline}. [America retains the Pacific as a
barrier and faces **no serious threats to its homeland.**]{.underline}
Of course, Washington sees domination of East Asia as an American
birthright. Base access obviously helps the U.S. attempt to enforce its
will. However[, convenience does not translate into interests
substantial enough to risk war.]{.underline} The region matters far more
to nearby China, which understandably does not want to be contained. It
also costs Beijing far less to deter U.S. intervention than it does for
America to project power: missiles and subs are less costly than
aircraft carrier groups. With no one threatening free navigation,
[Washington must decide what kind of risk it is willing to take on
behalf of what remain primarily other nations' territorial interests.
Insisting on defending the Philippines irrespective of its actions is
particularly dangerous]{.underline}. [Manila]{.underline} relies on
American support rather than its own military in confronting China [and
could **drag the United States into a conflict easily.** Washington
should drop the "mutual" defense treaty and joint patrols]{.underline}.
Maintaining base access is good insurance but does not require a
security guarantee, especially over contested territory, such as
Scarborough Shoal. Moreover, [such access is not worth paying any
price]{.underline}: America lost no influence when Subic Bay and Clark
Airfield closed decades ago. President [Duterte is not a reliable ally.
The United States should not allow such an unpredictable regime to be a
trigger for war.]{.underline}

## 1AC -- Kritikal (Colonialism)

### 1ac -- Colonialism 

#### For years the US has maintained its influence over the Philippines to further its exploitative and imperialist agenda. Despite revolt and dissent, the US has kept its hand in Filipino affairs. From the Filipino American War to the economic theft during the Marcos Administration, the United States has always been the antagonist to the independence of the Philippine nation.

**David, PhD, 89** (Leonard, Revolutionary Struggle in the Philippines,
St. Martin's Press, p. 174-176)-n

The first chapter in this book identified the [Philippines as a country
in crisis, political crisis, a country being **cramped into a right wing
perspective by the economic and military jaws of US aspirations for
world control,** and therefore]{.underline} world
[domination]{.underline}. In this global game, [the **Americans laugh
behind the backs of Filipinos** as they use and abuse them - providing
cheap labour to bring in huge profits for multinational
companies]{.underline}; [putting them in the front line in case of
nuclear attack;]{.underline} and having on hand an inexhaustible supply
of young Asian women to satisfy the insatiable sexual appetite of more
than 30000 service personnel who exploit and demean the inhabitants of
another sovereign country. [How does the \'moral majority\' in the US
square its conscience as 10 000 of its population go ashore each night
at Subic Bay]{.underline} - and others tumble out of the other bases -
**[to ravage the local population - women, men and even
children?]{.underline}** Conveniently, as it does in Western Europe,
[the US puts another country - in this case the Philippines - in the
\'hot seat\' for the first strike in the event of nuclear
war]{.underline}, perhaps [just hoping that one or two bombs \'would
bring the world to its senses\' and leave the US and its citizens
unscathed and unharmed. The **very presence of the US in the Philippines
increases the likelihood of nuclear war** with every day that
passes.]{.underline} In line with Emmanuel\'s analysis, reports in
Philippine Agenda show, for instance, that if a one-megaton bomb were
dropped on the JUSMAG offices in Quezon City - where extensive security
building works took place in 1987 - everything would be annihilated
within several miles. In an instant, 9000 people would be dead and most
buildings turned to rubble. Quezon City and San Juan residents would be
the most affected. Several seconds later, 1.25 million more would die
and hundreds of thousands of others would be severely injured in
surrounding municipalities (Sampaloc, Pandacan, San Miguel, Quiapo,
Santa Cruz, San Juan, dei Monte and parts of Paco, Santa Ana, Tondo,
Caloocan and Mandaluyong). Eighteen seconds after that, 750000 would die
in Makati, Ermita, Malate, Santa Ana, Paco, Intramuros, South Port, San
Nicolas, Binondo, Tondo, Navotas, Malabon, Marikina, Pasig and portions
of Valenzuela and Pasay. Forty seconds later, another 170000 people
would be dead in Paranaque, Pasay, Pateros, Taquig, Taytay, Cainta,
Antipolo, San Mateo, Obando, Meycauayan, and the rest of Malabon,
Novotas and Valenzuela. In less than aminute, over two million people
would have died and more would have been severelyinjured. Iffourofthe US
main facilities in the Philippines, namely, Clark Air Base, Subic Naval
Station, San Miguel Communications Station and JUSMAG , were attacked
simultaneously, [one-tenth of the country\'s population -six million
Filipinos would die from the blasts, from burns, from radiation
sickness, and later from cancer. Many more would be severely hurt. Five,
10, 15 or 20 million Filipinos could perish as a result of thisor any
other reason - and **for many Americans this would only be yet another
item on a news broadcast.**]{.underline} [There is no respect for huinan
dignity; women\'s bodies are something that Americans in the Philippines
seem to think they have a right to buy or degrade as they see fit; and
the **exploitation, pollution and rape of the land become an entitlement
because of wealth and power.** If]{.underline} ever new technology,
[a]{.underline} new world order or the [opportunity for a more desirable
location for the siting of the bases could be found, **the US would
\'ditch\' the Philippines overnight.**]{.underline} **[What does the
word \'ally\' mean to the US?]{.underline}** When [more than 3000 people
drowned in the Philippines in the worst sea tragedy known to
man]{.underline} - on 20 December 1987 - [what relief did the US send to
families of the bereaved? **Nothing**]{.underline}. How concerned was
the US when such a sea disaster affected the lives of tens of thousands
of Filipinos? [What happened to the \'special relationship\' so
frequently referred to when antiAmerican feeling is particularly
apparent?]{.underline} Clearly, **[the most important thing for the US
to do is to pack up and leave.]{.underline}** [For 90 years, they have
used the Philippines as a staging post for aggressive acts within the
region, they have brutalised the people and warped and twisted the
culture. They have reached the point where, unless they withdraw, they
will be forced into \'bloody\' local encounters]{.underline} - both
fighting alongside the AFP and being on the receiving end of acts of
sabotage against their installations or being the victims of individual
attacks. The assassination of three Americans on 28 October 1987 should
serve as a warning. Many others are targeted, given the \'right\' set of
circumstances. This is made quite clear in a statement issued by the NDF
on 5 November 1987, and signed by Satur Ocampo, who - with Antonio
Zumel - made up the NDF panel during the ceasefire negotiations: The
National Democratic Front wams the United States government to stop
meddling in the internal affairs of the Philippine people, or pay a high
price for its military-political intervention in terms of American lives
and property. [The proponents of \'Iow intensity conflict\' in the
Pentagon, the eIA and the State Department are mercilessly pushing to
intensify the level of violence inflicted upon our people, both in rural
and urban areas, through the \'total war\' designed, directed and
assisted by the US]{.underline}. [The objective]{.underline} of this war
[is to]{.underline} stern the advance of the revolutionary movement and
to pr[eserve US economic, military and geopolitical interests in the
Philippines.]{.underline} For a long time now, the NDF and a broad
spectrum of people\'s organisations have denounced and opposed [US
intervention as a major cause of the nation\'s problems.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales to the Philippines are a product of American imperialism -- the idea of 'military cooperation' should be problematized and cast as interventionist violence.

Under [the Tydings-McDuffie law which created the Philippine
Commonwealth]{.underline}, the war-devastated Philippines was granted
formal independence. But certain conditions [defined the limits of
nominal sovereignty.]{.underline} The first condition required the
Philippine Congress to accept the terms of the 1946 Philippine Trade Act
which provided some rehabilitation money to repair the war-damaged
economy. More crucially, [the Act required an amendment to the
Philippine Constitution that gave U.S. citizens equal rights in the
exploitation of natural resources and ownership of public utilities and
other businesses.]{.underline} In effect, [the **colonizers retained
their old privileged status**.]{.underline} What was more decisive was
the revival of the oligarchy\'s sugar industry via tariff allowances and
quotas, the abrogation of control over import tariffs on U.S. goods,
prohibition of interference with foreign exchange (pegging the local
currency to the dollar), and unlimited remittance of profits for U.S.
corporations. Free trade guaranteed the status of the former possession
as a market for finished commodities and investments as well as a source
of cheap agricultural products and raw materials. The Act was rammed
through Congress by expelling left-wing legislators in line with the
CIA-directed military campaign against the Huks (Woddis 1967, 38-40).
[The second condition was the approval of the 1947 U.S.-Philippines
Treaty of General Relations which empowered the U.S. to exercise supreme
authority over extensive military bases. It also guaranteed the property
rights of U.S. corporations and citizens]{.underline}, thus
[**nullifying the sovereignty of the new** republic. This was followed
by]{.underline} the 1947 Military Bases Agreement that guaranteed the
[U.S. occupation of extensive military bases for 99 years.]{.underline}
This included the two major facilities, Clark Air Base and Subic Naval
Base, used as strategic springboards for intervention in Asia and the
Middle East during the Korean War, Vietnam War, and the Iraq wars. The
Agreement also prohibited the Philippines from granting
extra-territorial rights to any other country, and placed no
restrictions on the uses to which the bases can be harnessed, nor the
types of weapons that can be deployed in them (Labor Research
Association 1958). [To reinforce its political and military ascendancy,
the U.S. also imposed the 1947 U.S.-Philippines Military Assistance Pact
to provide military assistance]{.underline}. Together [with this, a US
military advisory group]{.underline} (JUSMAG) was assigned to the
Philipine armed forces that [would exercise direct control by
supervising staff planning, intelligence personnel training and
logistics]{.underline}. All military hardware and financial backing must
be cleared through JUSMAG. Meanwhile, the US AID Public Safety Division
managed the tutelage of local police agencies[. US-supplied weapons,
training and logistics were immediately used in the counter-insurgency
campaign]{.underline} against the Huks in the early fifties, [and later
on, to support the parasitic elite and Marcos\' authoritarian
regime]{.underline} in the sixties, seventies and eighties. In a
revealing testimony to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee in
1969[, Lt. General Robert Warren clarified the role of the U.S.
military]{.underline} in the Philppines: \"\"[To provide advice and
assistance to]{.underline} the Armed Forces of [the
Philippines]{.underline} in the form of training material and services
[as necessary to assure **protection of US interests**]{.underline} in
the Philippines [and to **promote US foreign policy
objectives**]{.underline} in the area[\"]{.underline} (US Senate 1969,
242). In 1954, the terms of free trade that worsened Philippine
dependency were modified in the 1954 Laurel-Langley Trade Agreement
which extended parity rights to Americans for all kinds of enterprises.
Tariff rules were readjusted, thus shifting U.S. leverage to direct
private investments into manufacturing instead of raw material
production. Due to import controls imposed by the Philippines, the U.S.
established assembly and packaging plants to produce consumer goods,
thus competing with local industries. This was the refinement of the
elaborate apparatus of the multinational or transnational corporations
that would dominate post-World War II international trade. Meanwhile,
[the Philippine economy continued to rely on the U.S.]{.underline} for
selling raw materials and buying more expensive technology. In 1970, the
U.S. controlled 80% of foreign investments in the country, approximately
one-third of all the total equity capital of the 900 largest
corporations. This represented 60% of U.S. investments in south-east
Asia at that time (Bayani 1976, 18). Crisis of the Neocolonial Order At
the height of the Cold War, with the U.S. bogged down in the IndoChina
war[, the Philippines underwent **severe economic and social blockages**
that destabilized the Marcos regime, an instrument of U.S.]{.underline}
Cold War strategy but an ironic comment on the role of the Philippines
as a traditional showcase for democracy and freedom in Asia. Marcos
dispatched 2,000 troops to Vietnam at the request of Washington. But his
economic base had been deteriorating since he won the presidency in the
sixties. Intense foreign stranglehold of the economy led to unchecked
flow of capital, acute inflation, devaluation and rise of external debt.
Exchange control was lifted in 1962, leading to capital outflow:
repatriation of profits exceeded overseas investment. The overdependence
on basic exports\--lumber, sugar, copper, coconuts, and other extracted
products\--of low value relative to imported finished goods led to a
trade deficit of \$302 million in 1969 (Fast 1973, 89). In addition, the
failure of the \"Green Revolution\" and the alleged \"miracle rice\"
varieties (developed by the Rockefeller-funded International Rice
Research Institute) aggravated the chronic shortage of rice as staple
food, renewing the specter of famine and unrest. Meanwhile, the social
contradictions between the oligarchic state and the majority of
pauperized peasants sharpened. Although the Huks (renamed People\'s Army
of Liberation) were violently suppressed by the CIA-backed Magsaysay
regime in the fifties, they enjoyed popular support in the extremely
polarized countryside. Crippled by the arrest of its leaders in 1950,
the Huks evolved into the New People\'s Army (NPA) when the Communist
Party was reorganized in 1969 by Maoist partisans who matured during the
resurgence of the nationalist, anti-imperialist movement evinced in
massive student demonstrations, peasant and workers\' strikes, and
agitation among professionals such as teachers, journalists, lay and
religious workers, women, urban poor, and so on. One of Marcos\'
justifications for declaring martial law in 1972 was the threat of a
communist takeover. In actuality, it was an outgrowth of Cold War
geopolitics and US attempt to re-assert its hegemony in Asia after its
Vietnam debacle. [Increased U.S. military and political support for the
Marcos dictatorship was insured when Marcos\' guaranteed American
business 100% profit remittance as well as opportunities to exploit the
country\'s natural resources, and also engage in banking, shipping,
domestic fishing, and so on]{.underline} (Javate-De Dios, Daroy and
Tirol 1988). Later investigations revealed that the [bulk of U.S. aid
ended up in the foreign bank accounts of the Marcos family and their
sycophantic cronies]{.underline} (Bonner 1987). Total [US military aid
for the Marcos regime exceeded all those given to Africa or to those for
Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, or Chile. Napalm and fragmentation
bombs]{.underline}, among others, [were supplied]{.underline} through
JUSMAG to be used against NPA and Moro insurgents in Mindanao fighting
the dictatorship. [US AID officials trained police in advanced
techniques of riot control, interrogation, and torture tactics applied
to political prisoners and detained suspects.]{.underline} US \"Special
Forces\" were also directly involved in counterinsurgency operations
disguised as civic action activities, operations which are still
maintained under the terms of the VFA and, more recently, under those of
EDCA. These two [agreements]{.underline} have virtually **[legitimized
the return of U.S. troops despite the dismantling of all U.S.
bases]{.underline}** in 1992. One can conclude that [\"US imperialism,
with its economic and military stake in the Philippines, is the
instigator and mastermind of the Marcos fascist
dictatorship]{.underline}\" (Bayani 1976, 38). [And it continues to
mastermind the human-rights violations, extrajudicial killings and
torture]{.underline}, of the succeeding administrations, from those of
Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos to Joseph Estrada, Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo, and Benigno Aquino III. Aftermath of the 1986 February
Revolution President Corazon Aquino\'s regime (1986-1990) was marked by
the 1987 massacre of 18 farmers in a peaceful demonstration and by
numerous human rights violations through hamletting, \"salvaging\"
(extra-judicial killings), torture, etc. (Maglipon 1987). Both Aquino
and her successor, General Fidel Ramos, had the approval of Washington
in maintaining a stable market for business and U.S. geopolitical
maneuvers in the Middle East. After Ramos, both Presidents Joseph
Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo pursued the \"Washington Consensus\"
of abiding by the structural conditionalities of the World
Bank-International Monetary Fund in its neoliberal program of
deregulation, privatization and dismantling of any large-scale
social-service programs for the impoverished and marginalized majority
of citizens (Eadie 2005; San Juan 2008). All land-reform programs
initiated since 1946 have failed to resolve the age-old problem of
landless farmers and iniquitous semi-feudal relatons between landlords
and rural workers (Putzel 1992). In 1992, the Philippine Senate voted to
dismantle the U.S. military bases, but did not touch the other
Agreements that maintained U.S. supervision of the military and police
agencies. The end of the Cold [War did not witness a decrease in U.S.
military intervention]{.underline}. In 2002, after the 9/11 Al Qaida
attacks, the US State Dept declared the Philippines to be the second
front in the war against global terrorism (Tuazon et al, 2002) and so
required special supervision and surveillance. Secretary of State Powell
categorized the Communist Party of the Philippines and the NPA as
terrorist organizations (Fletcher 2013). While the major Moro groups,
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), were not stigmatized as terrorist, the U.S.
singled out the Abu Sayyaf splinter group as a reason for justifying the
1999 VFA and the 2002 Mutual Logistics Support Agreement that allowed
the initial troop deployment of 600 Special Operations forces to assist
the Philippine military in counter-insurgency operations. The killing of
a Filipino transgender in October 2014 by US Marine Private Joseph Scott
Pemberton called attention once again to the impunity of U.S. personnel
in numerous criminal cases. The VFA gives extra-territorial and
extra-judicial rights to visiting American troops, an exceptional
condition banned by the 1987 Philippine Constitution. Thus the
Philippines could not detain the suspected killer, undermining its
national sovereignty and its system of justice (Ayroso 2014). Meanwhile
the MILF is in the process of negotiating a peace agreement with
President Aquino under the auspices of the U.S. Institute of Peace and
the Malaysian government, while the MNLF has fragmented into various
camps since the 1996 accord with the government, a conclusion to the
1976 Tripoli Agreement between the MNLF and Marcos (Graf, Kreuzer and
Werning 2009). The government\'s dialogue with the National Democratic
Front-Philippines remains frozen while the Aquino regime is plagued with
corruption, disaster relief, energy shortages, and the stalemate with
China over the Scarborough Shoal and Spratley Islands confrontation in
which the U.S. Navy and Air Force presence figure prominently (Heydarian
2013). From Cold War to War on Terror Since 2002, the joint annual
military exercises called \"Philippine-US Bilateral Exercises\" have
been held allegedly to give humanitarian assistance during natural
disasters to victimized provinces. They also offer weapons, logistics
and other support to the government campaigns to secure peace and order
in war zones, or in vital metropolitan areas (as in the 2012 exercise
around the National Capitol Region). Just like the Civic Action programs
refined during the anti-Huk drives of the fifties, these exercises
supplement violent repression with psywar and other unconventional
techniques to win \"hearts and minds,\" closely following the U.S.
Counterinsurgency Guide of 2009 and its associated field manuals.
President Arroyo\'s Oplan Bantay Laya and President Benigno Aquino\'s
Oplan Bayanihan are updated versions of the counterinsurgency strategy
and tactics applied by the U.S. in Vietnam, El Salvador, Iraq,
Afghanistan, and elsewhere. They combine intensive military operations,
intelligence and civic action or triad operations, conventional warfare
methods, and counterguerilla tactics. The U.S. learned as much from its
tutelage of its colonial subjects as Filipinos did through a
cross-fertilization of security and espionage practices. The historian
Alfred McCoy concludes his inventory of such practices with the remark:
\"Empire has been a reciprocal process, shaping state formation in
Manila and Washington while moving both nations into a mutually
implicated postcolonial world\" (2009, 522). The 1951 Mutual Defense
Treaty continues to legitimize U.S. \"low intensity warfare,\" such as
the sustained anti-NPA drives during President Corazon Aquino\'s tenure
(Bello 1989). During the Arroyo presidency, the U.S. maintained official
headquarters of the U.S.-Philippine Joint Special Operations Task Force
Philippines (JSOTF-P) inside the Camp Navarro of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines\' Western Mindanao Comnmand in Zamboanga City where Moro
insurgents are active. Drones and other sophisticated equipment are
handled by U.S. Special Forces against the Abu Sayyaf now valorized as
an Al Qaida offshoot, with linkages to other recent terrorist groups
such as the Jemaah Islamiyah and the Islamic State (ISIS) in Syria. To
supplement JUSMAG, a new agency called Defense Policy Board was created
to handle issues of international terrorism, maritime safety,
transnational crime, natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, etc. Other
\"cooperative security locations\" (as these facilities are
euphemistically called) are found in Clark, Subic, Mactan International
Airport, and in other clandestine areas (Klare 2005). It is in these
areas occupied by U.S. advisers and staff where torture, enforced
disappearances, and extra-judicial killings occur. One recent case is
that of American health worker Melissa Roxas who was kidnapped and
tortured by military agents in 2009. Documenting the accelerated
kidnappings and extra-judicial murders of activists already publicized
by Amnesty International and UN rapporteurs such as Philip Alston, the
Filipino group KARAPATAN noted the 1,111 percent increase of military
assistance to the Arroyo regime beginning 2001 when the first Balikatan
exercise was held (Lefebvre 2010). This aid continues indiscrimiinately
with horrendous consequences. Provisional Coda In March 2007, the
Permanent People\'s Tribunal based in Europe heard witnesses about
government abuses and judged Presidents Bush and Arroyo guilty of crimes
against humanity\" (San Juan 2007, Appendix C). The verdict reviews [the
U.S. imposition of virtual colonial status on the Philippines via
numerous military and security agreements that **insured domination**
over the economy, State apparatus, and internal security.]{.underline}
Under the guise of the global \"war on terror\" against extremists, [the
U.S. continues to deploy and station thousands of troops, at any one
time, in the Philippines. They participate in combat operations against
local insurgents\--a gross violation of Philippine sovereignty and
territorial integrity]{.underline}. The Tribunal observed that \"because
of its strategic location, the Philippines is vital for the U.S.
projection of military force in East Asia and as far away as the Middle
East,\" serving as transit points and refueling stations in its wars of
aggression against the people of Afghanistan and of Iraq, as well as the
people of the Philippines. President Bush was an accomplice of President
Arroyo in the systematic violation of the rights of the Filipino people,
which are also crimes of humanity. U.S. mperialism was indicted as an
international scourge. From the sixteenth century to the present,
imperialism, whether in the mode of Spanish old-style colonialism,
Japanese militarism, and [U.S. tutelage in
modernization/developmentalism, **represents one of the worst
manifestations of an oppressive system of exploitation of
peoples**]{.underline} that have been outlawed by the United Nations
Charter and its Declaration of Human Rights. [Nonetheless, it persists

#### Western colonial influences continue to underpin the Philippines' transnational geopolitical relationships. This undermines sovereignty and creates a relationship that forges a dependence on US leadership. This dichotomy forecloses possibilities of true freedom for the Philippines.

In these cases, Spain and [the US function as the ports through which
the Philippines and **Filipinos become 'better' and come to matter
within national and transnational relations** of power and market
economies.]{.underline} Both nations are understood as bestowing
cultural and financial capital to the Philippines. This can be evidenced
through the connection of OFW success and the 'American dream',6 as well
as through the familial partnership my family make with Spain, its
colonial history and its ongoing impact on Filipino diasporas. Such
[deference for 'western' power is the consequence of]{.underline} the
long history of Castilian Spanish colonial control of the Philippines
and [US imperialism]{.underline}, both of [which have reduced the
Philippines to a state of colonial dependency]{.underline}. Castilian
Spanish colonial governance spanned from 1521 to 1898 and formal US
political governance endured from 1899 to 1946. The influence of these
periods stretches into the present moment, continuing to impact on how
Filipinos can belong, or not belong, to national and transnational
social structures. Many scholars have used the term 'colonial mentality'
to analyse and describe this colonial and imperial impact, as the second
chapter of this book will explore. It is this sense of the 'uncommon'
that Filipinos believe can provide a better, richer and happier life if
they migrate to the US. The Somatechnics of Whiteness and Race But, what
is colonial mentality? [Within the Filipino diaspora, colonial mentality
refers to the ways in which many Filipinos prefer westernised practices
to 'nonwestern' forms of being/becoming.]{.underline} In this case, t[he
concept of colonial mentality distinguishes between the 'west' and the
'non-west' as if t**hey are enclosed, homogenous entities without
diversity and difference within them.** This]{.underline} [serves to
constitute the practice of colonial mentality as a means to align with a
homogenous idea of westernised progress, development and
'civilisation']{.underline}. Speaking to this conceptualisation of
colonial mentality, Delia D. Aguilar states: 'One wonders how
exhortations to combat imperialism, together with that self-critical
designation "colonial mentality" can fail to invade the essential realm
of the "superstructure"' (1988, p. 21). Dero Pedero also weighs in on
the issue of colonial mentality and its everyday visibility: Every day
we are bombarded by advertisements where the light-skinned girl gets the
admiring stares, the fair mestiza lands the job, the fairer girl gets
the man. Notice the billboards that literally gobble up the highway \[in
Manila\]. Plastered on them is either some blond foreigner or the pale,
smiling face of a local mestiza movie star. To be a model or an actor in
this country, you have to be tisoyin or tisayin meaning, on the fair
side (never mind that you can't act!) (2006, p. 1). Aguilar and Pedero's
quotations lay bare some of the attitudes and issues that form the crux
of this book. [These]{.underline} quotes [seek to expose the colonising,
imperial and racialised manner in which the Republic of the Philippines
becomes constituted as a specific nation-state]{.underline} and how this
begins to interact with other nations, such as Australia. For instance,
the first quotation by Delia D. Aguilar ponders the [failure of extant
theoretical, philosophical and political insights in uncovering and
challenging the powerful thrust of colonial and imperial relations that
form the Philippines]{.underline}. Aguilar focuses on the concept of
'colonial mentality' and refers to this as the means through which
Filipinos can self-reflexively assess their relationship to colonising
processes. Aguilar thus uses the term 'colonial mentality' to underscore
the asymmetrical relations of power engendered by colonising [power. By
using the term 'colonial mentality' in this manner, Aguilar]{.underline}
(1988) [remarks how it can still fail to 'invade the realm of the
"superstructure"']{.underline} (p. 21). 'Superstructure', according to
Aguilar, refers to the norms that underpin society, its
governmentalities and individual ways of being/becoming. In frustration,
Aguilar asks why this failure exists when the concept of colonial
mentality seeks to unmask the 'superstructure' and its normative claims
on identity. Aguilar's frustration towards the concept of colonial
mentality is as relevant now as it was in 1988 when she voiced her
concerns towards the limits of the concept. This is because many
analyses of Philippine colonial and imperial 7 Hereinafter cited as the

histories continue to use the concept of colonial mentality (Quimpo
2003, 2004; Jimenez-Magsanoc 2009; David and Okazaki 2006, David 2011).
Taking a different approach, this book steers away from depending on the
concept of colonial mentality. Instead, I employ the concept of
somatechnology, as well as critical race and whiteness studies, to think
through the discourses and practices engendered by individuals,
institutions and bilateral initiatives within the Philippines, its
diaspora and negotiations with Australia and Australians.

#### The US forwards military assets and interests as a way of oppressing Filipino society and furthering its imperialist regime. Only the aff ends the extension of power that serves to capitalize off Filipino suffering. This exploitation creates the narrative in which the US always comes out on top and marginalizes Filipinos.

I. Perpetuated US Aggression **[The US fully assumed the character of an
imperialist power, on the basis of monopoly capitalism,]{.underline}**
when it deliberately provoked the Spanish-American War of 1898 in order
to seize the colonies of Spain: Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines.
In connection with said war, the US pretended to make friends with the
Aguinaldo junta in Hongkong and actually brought Aguinaldo back to the
Philippines on an American cutter to proclaim Philippine independence
(under the "protection" of the US) and to resume the national war of
independence against Spain. The Filipino people succeeded in liberating
themselves nationwide and were about to seize Intramuros, the walled
citadel of the Spanish colonizers. But the US interfered with the
deployment of Filipino troops for the purpose and maneuvered to prepare
for the landing of more US troops. Behind the back of their supposed
Filipino allies, the US interveners arranged with the Spanish side a
mock battle on August 13, 1898 to justify the surrender of the latter to
the former. It was done on the day after Spain and the US signed an
armistice agreement ending the Spanish-American War. [The US and Spain
forged the Treaty of Paris of December 10, 1898 in which Spain sold the
Philippines to the US for the amount of USD 20 million. On December 21,
1898 US President McKinley issued the Proclamation of Benevolent
Assimilation to manifest the US plan to colonize the
Philippines.]{.underline} **[The US started to unleash a war of
aggression against the Filipino people on February 4,
1899.]{.underline}** This has come to be known as the Filipino-American
War. The US used superior military force and extreme barbarity of more
than 126,000 troops to conquer the nation of 7,000,000 people. It
ruthlessly carried out massacres, the torture of captives, the
reconcentration of population, scorched earth tactics and food
blockades. It killed more than 700,000 or 10 per cent of the Filipino
people from 1899 to 1902, directly through its brutal operations and
indirectly through consequent famines and epidemics. Likewise, it
proceeded to kill 800,000 Filipinos up to 1916. **[To keep the
Philippines as a colony, the US established military bases at various
strategic points. It organized the so-called Philippine Scouts as puppet
troops and subsequently converted them into the Philippine
Constabulary.]{.underline}** As a result of relentless demands of the
Filipino people for national independence, the US decided as early as
1935 to make the Philippines a semi-colony in 1946 after a ten-year
transition period under the so-called Commonwealth government. [The
National Defense Act of 1936 was this government´s first legislative act
making the puppet constabulary the First Regular Army under the direct
supervision of US Army´s Philippine Department.]{.underline}
Commonwealth president Quezon made General Douglas MacArthur the field
marshal of the puppet army. The US formed, indoctrinated, equipped and
trained the puppet army. On the eve of World War II, it placed this
puppet army within the frame of the US Army Forces in the Far East
(USAFFE). . When World War II broke out in 1941, the Japanese fascists
defeated the US army in Bataan and occupied the Philippines up to 1945.
To recover the Philippines as a colony, the US coordinated with the
USAFFE guerrillas. [Before the grant of nominal independence to the
Philippines in 1946, the US imposed on the puppet Filipino leaders the
Treaty of General Relations which ensured the continuance of US military
bases and the property rights of US citizens and corporations. This
treaty even required in advance that the diplomatic relations of the
Philippines would be subject to approval by the US. After the
Philippines became a semicolony, the US perpetuated its successful
aggression and continued to control the Philippine state militarily**.
It obtained a military assistance agreement to make the Philippine armed
services dependent on US planning, training, intelligence and
equipment;** and a military bases agreement for US military forces to
stay in the Philippines for another 99 years. It also bound the
Philippines to a mutual defense pact and a US controlled regional
security pact, the South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO).
**Because of its military power over the Philippines, the US has been
able to dominate the Philippine economy and politics and intervene at
will in Philippine affairs since 1946**. It manipulated the outcome of
presidential elections in favor of the candidate most compliant with and
servile to US interests in the Philippines and in the region. **It
instigated the Marcos fascist dictatorship in 1972 in a futile attempt
to suppress the revolutionary mass movement** that had emerged and
developed since 1961 because of the wanton extraction of superprofits by
US corporation, bueaucratic corruption and the exhaustion of the land
frontier. The Filipino peopĺe were outraged that the fascist regime
could persist for so long, from 1972 to 1986, because of US military and
economic assistance to it. **They were also incensed by the direct and
indirect consequences of US planes, ships and troops operating in and
around the US bases.**]{.underline} Thus, after the downfall of Marcos,
the framers of the 1987 constitution enjoyed overwhelming popular
support and took courage in adopting provisions that banned foreign
military bases, troops, facilities and nuclear weapons from the
Philippines. This ban was indeed the fruit of the people's revolutionary
struggle against the fallen US-instigated dictatorship. The military
bases agreement with the US was terminated in 1991 by the Philippine
Senate, with the open and strong support of the national democratic
movement. But since then, [the US has resorted to all sorts of maneuvers
to circumvent the constitutional ban on foreign military bases. By
invoking the US-RP mutual defense pact**. It has used the Balikatan
joint US-Philippine military exercises and interoperability training as
pretext for the forward stations** and rotational presence of US troops
in the Philippines. **It has been able**]{.underline} to obtain the
Visiting Forces Agreement and the Mutual Logisticsl Support Agreement to
**[allow the entry and stationing of US military forces anywhere in the
Philippines for any duration of time. It has used 9-11 and the so-called
US global war on terror to justify US military presence and intervention
in the Philippines. It has also expanded the pretexts for such
Intervention.]{.underline}** These include humanitarian aid, medical
mission, civic action, disaster-related aid for rescue, relief and
rehabilitation; and so on. [The latest pretext of the US for further
entrenching itself militarily in the Philippines is to make a strategic
pivot to Asia-Pacific region and to protect the country from a putative
Chinese aggression in view of the overreaching claims of China over 90
per cent of the South China Sea, encroaching on 90 per cent of
the]{.underline} exclusive economic zone ([EEZ]{.underline})
[and]{.underline} [100 per cent of the]{.underline} extended continental
shelf ([ECS]{.underline}) of the Philippines. Thus, with the servile
collaboration of the Aquino regime, the US has been able to obtain the
so-called Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). [This agreement
allows the US to establish military bases in an indefinite number of
so-called Agreed Areas, fortified at Philippine expense, paying no rent,
enjoying perimeter security from puppet troops free of charge, barring
Philippine authorities from knowing things and activities inside the US
military enclaves or bases]{.underline} and allowing US air planes and
ships to come and go, with the Philippine authorities barred by the US
military from knowing whether such vessels carry nuclear, chemical,
bacteriological and other weapons of mass destruction. Moreover, the
agreement requires the AFP to provide or facilitate access by US forces
to any place whatsoever in Philippine territory that the US decides.
Despite the treason and obsequiousness of the Aquino regime in acceding
to EDCA, US President Obama in his recent visit to Manila clearly
declared that the US is neutral over the Philippine-China maritime
dispute in the West Philippine Sea and that US policy is not to counter
or contain China. In fact, the US has a dual policy of cooperation and
contention with China and makes its decisions according to US national
interest. At any rate, the US has far more interest in relations with
China than in those with the Philippines. The people should be alert to
the possibility that the US and China could agree to jointly explore and
exploit the oil, gas and other natural resources in the EEZ and ECS of
the Philippines. **[In the face of the perpetuated aggression of US
imperialism in the Philippines, the Filipino people and their
revolutionary forces have adopted the line of people's democratic
revolution through protracted people's war. They are waging a civil war
against the semicolonial political system.]{.underline}** At the same
time, they condemn the escalating military intervention of the US in
favor of the puppet regime. They are therefore prepared to wage a war of
national liberation should the US unleash a full-scale war of
aggression. They are not afraid of such possibility but prepare against
it**[. They consider it an opportunity to realize justice for the heroes
martyred by US imperialism and for the suffering of the millions of
people as a consequence of the direct and indirect rule of US
imperialism.]{.underline}**

#### Even now US Arms sales serve to reassert colonial structures and dependency in the Philippines. It is no longer a question of empiricism. It is now an ongoing phenomenon, which needs to be addressed via the acts of refusal and compliance.

But as mentioned, [there's more to foreign aid than the simple altruism
of donors]{.underline}. Aid, [especially **US aid, is used not for
development cooperation but to advance the interests and agenda of the
donor and deepen their patron-client relationship with the aid
recipient**]{.underline}. **[It is an effective neocolonial tool to
foster continued dependence and subservience]{.underline}**, [and steer
domestic policy making in directions that the donor wants.]{.underline}
Lastly, aid is also a means for the US to directly create profit-making
opportunities for their transnational corporations (TNCs). Education,
health, disaster relief Remember how the US used the public education
system as an integral part of their colonization campaign in the
Philippines? It was far more successful in making Filipinos subservient
to the colonizers than using purely military might. Colonial education
was so effective that many Filipinos could not imagine life without the
US. Just look at the reaction to Duterte's stance on independent foreign
policy. It continues to this day through, among others, the use of
foreign assistance. Classified by purpose, the largest bilateral US aid
disbursed to the Philippines in 2015 was in Primary Education at
US\$25.33 million. Almost half of this amount, US\$12.49 million, went
to the Basa Pilipinas project of the USAID. Through this project, the US
develops and distributes teaching and learning materials, English books
and reading materials, etc. for local teachers to use for their Grades
1-3 pupils. Another US\$5.35 million in US aid was also disbursed for
Higher Education in 2015. (See Chart 1)
arn-07-us-aid-and-imperialism-oct-2016-chart-1 The second biggest chunk
of US aid disbursement last year went to Material Relief Assistance and
Services with US\$20.37 million. They also disbursed US\$3.84 million
for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness;US\$1.92 million for Emergency
Food Aid; and more than US\$1 million for Relief Coordination,
Protection and Support Services. The US has been using disaster relief
to justify and expand their military presence in disaster-prone
countries like the Philippines. The controversial Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), for instance, was justified using the
pretext of humanitarian aid and disaster relief. American troops can
base in military facilities here so they can preposition not just their
weapons and war machines but also "humanitarian relief supplies". (Read
for instance, US Secretary of State John Kerry's recent statement on
EDCA made last July 2016) Family Planning also traditionally gets a big
portion of US aid with disbursement reaching US\$17.08 million in 2015.
Related sectors also got significant amounts such as Reproductive Health
Care (US\$3.94 million) and Population Policy and Administrative
Management (US\$0.43 million). Po[pulation control has long been a
strategy of US imperialism in the Philippines. I]{.underline}n 1974, the
USAID and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), among others, produced the
"Kissinger Report". It said that population growth threatens US access
to the natural resources of poor countries. [A large population of youth
must also be controlled because they are most likely to challenge US
imperialism.]{.underline} The Philippines is one of 13 countries
identified in the Kissinger Report as primary targets of US-led
population control efforts. Public health is another major sector that
the US has been long supporting in the country. In 2015, the US
disbursed US\$16.04 million in aid for Tuberculosis Control and more
than US\$0.90 million for STD Control including HIV/AIDS. A productive
and efficient (and, of course, cheap) labor force is one of the primary
resources that US imperialism exploits for super profits. Control of
infectious diseases like TB and AIDShelps ensure an efficient workforce,
which poor countries with weak public health systems due to imperialist
plunder and underdevelopment could not afford Plus, big US
pharmaceutical companies that have monopoly over patented drugs used in
these health programs are assured of markets. In the Philippines, for
instance, the anti-TB campaign is a partnership between USAID and
Johnson & Johnson, an American pharmaceutical and consumer goods giant.
Aid and policymaking But the biggest impact of US aid in the Philippines
is on how national economic policies and priorities are determined.
Obama, for instance, introduced the Partnership for Growth (PFG)
initiative. It is an aid program participated in and coordinated by the
USAID, State Department, Millennium Challenge Corp. (MCC) and other US
agencies as well as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and various UN bodies. Through the PFG, the US deepens its role in
national policy making such as through the five-year Joint Country
Action Plan (JCAP), which identified priority areas for policy reforms
in the Philippines. These include trade and investment liberalization,
deregulation, effective enforcement of contracts with private business
(such as those engaging in public-private partnership or PPP), as well
as fiscal and judicial reforms. An example of how US steers internal
policy-making is the PFG's centerpiece program in the Philippines, which
is the \$433.91-million grant from the MCC. The MCC is a highly
conditional aid and requires the Philippines to, among others, maintain
so-called "economic freedom" to continue receiving the grant. One of the
indicators of economic freedom, as designed by the MCC, is the Trade
Policy Indicator. It measures the country's openness to international
trade based on average tariff rates and non-tariff barriers (e.g. trade
quotas, production subsidies, government procurement procedures,
anti-dumping, local content requirements, etc.) to trade. The "Compact"
or agreement between the Philippine government (as represented then by
the Aquino administration) and MCC is that the latter may suspend or
terminate the grant if the country fails to reverse its policies that
are inconsistent with the Trade Policy Indicator and other indicators
designed by the MCC. Also part of the implementation of the PFG is The
Arangkada Philippines Project (TAPP) of the USAID and the American
Chamber of Commerce (AmCham). Through the USAID-funded TAPP, AmCham is
pushing for 471 specific recommendations that promote the interest of
foreign corporations in the country through greater liberalization,
deregulation, privatization and denationalization. These are contained
in the comprehensive advocacy paper "Arangkada Philippines 2010: A
business perspective" prepared by the Joint Foreign Chambers of Commerce
in the Philippines (JFC), of which AmCham is a key member. Under the
TAPP, the JFC has been producing Legislation Policy Briefsthat identify
broad recommendations for Congress and the Executive. Among the many
proposals of the JFC is the lifting of constitutional restrictions on
foreign investments through Charter change (Cha-cha). All these are in
preparation for the country's future membership in the US-led
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. The TPP is an ambitious free
trade deal and the latest campaign of US imperialism to further deepen
and consolidate its economic domination in Asia Pacific in the face of a
rising China. Just last March 2016, the US Chamber of Commerce, with
funding from USAID under the PFG's five-year US\$12.84-million
Trade-Related Assistance for Development (TRADE) project, released its
"readiness assessment" of Philippine membership in the TPP. The said
report examined the "consistency of the country's existing policy
framework with the agreement's requirements, and the implied changes
that may be necessary if the Philippines is to meet these requirements".
As expected, one of the "implied changes" is liberalization through
Cha-cha. (The full report may be downloadedhere) Military patronage
Lastly, [the US employs military aid not to modernize the Armed Forces
of the Philippines]{.underline} (AFP) **[but to maintain its influence
and control over our military]{.underline}**. US military aid mostly
comes in the form of Foreign Military Financing (FMF). Under the FMF,
the US provides grants and loans to help the Philippines buy US-made
weapons and defense equipment as well as acquiring defense services and
military training. In 2014, US\$50 million in FMF was disbursed by the
US to the Philippines out of the total US\$57 million in military aid
that year. [The Philippines is traditionally one of the largest
recipients of FMF among all US allies.]{.underline} It ranked fifth in
2014 in terms of FMF behind Egypt, Israel, Pakistan and Jordan. The
country also accounted for 64% of US FMF in East Asia and the Pacific.
(Data here) However, [military items that the country gets under the FMF
and other US military aid programs are either surplus or second-hand and
antiquated military articles]{.underline}. They are also not actually
given for free but are sold at a discount (with a portion of the amount
shouldered or waived by the US through the FMF). Examples include the
five-decade old US Coast Guard vessels ("Hamilton-class cutters") that
the US Navy has retired and sold to the Philippines. Since 2012, the
Philippines has already bought two of these decommissioned ships for
about US\$25 million -- and a third one is expected soon -- through the
FMF, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Excess Defense Article (EDA)
programs. The weapons systems of the ships have also been removed by the
US prior to their turnover to the Philippine Navy. [The]{.underline}
[country had to separately purchase from the US the vessels' weapons and
guns as well as additional technology including radar system, anti-ship
missile system, etc. US military aid thus also **means more business for
the US military industrial complex.**]{.underline} Aside from FMF, other
US military aid programs in the Philippines include counter-narcotics,
military education and training, cooperative threat reduction, and
counter-terrorism fellowship program. (SeeChart 2)
arn-07-us-aid-and-imperialism-oct-2016-chart-2 Along with annual
military exercises under the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA),
**[military aid fosters complete dependence of the AFP on US military
technology, hardware and expertise.]{.underline}** It [also helps
justify the continued presence of American troops in the
country.]{.underline} But [despite decades of US military patronage, the
AFP remains one of the weakest and least modernized in the
region.]{.underline} The Abu Sayyaf that [the US has long been using to
legitimize their military presence in the country persists and continues
to terrorize the people]{.underline}. Mutual respect, sovereignty
Foreign aid is not necessarily bad. It is, in fact, an important element
of cooperation among countries to promote development. But [as the case
of US aid in the Philippines illustrates, aid could also be used to
perpetuate the skewed relationship between the donor and recipient,
between the colonial master and colony]{.underline}. Such unequal,
oppressive and exploitative relation between the US and the Philippines
is the real reason why the country is underdeveloped and Filipinos are
starving. If the Duterte administration rejects US aid to pursue a truly
independent foreign policy and nurture development cooperation with
other countries based on mutual respect and sovereignty, then we are
already taking the initial steps to address the underlying causes of our
poverty and hunger.

#### Currents of western imperialism have long lasting effects on Filipinos. Colonial mentality leads to psychological violence, which spills over to mental and physical damage. This impact should frame your ballot, as it is a lens to evaluate the structures that oppress minorities and the nature of American imperialism.

**David Ph.D., 17** \[E.J.R., Associate professor of Psychology at the
University of Alaska, Anchorage, "Filipinos, Colonial Mentality, and

I was just in the Philippines recently, where [**I saw skin-whitening
products and clinics everywhere**! It is also where I saw the pervasive
vestiges of western colonial influences, from the widespread use of
English and the regard of it as the language of the educated or upper
class,]{.underline} to the abundance of western restaurants and **[shops
that make Manila seem more Americanized than many places in America
itself.]{.underline}** All of these, of course, are remnants of the
Philippines' long history of colonization under Spain and the United
States. So **[colonialism, and its most insidious legacy, colonial
mentality, has been on my mind.]{.underline}** And it seems like it has
been on other Filipinos' minds lately too. For instance[, the viral AJ+
video featuring Kristian Kabuay shows that his quest to revive Baybayin
is his attempt to restore and repair the immense cultural damages that
colonialism brought onto Filipinos. Also, Asia Jackson's viral AJ+ video
on colorism and anti-dark skin attitudes among Filipinos touch on
colonial mentality as well.]{.underline} And even further, I definitely
made sure I brought up colonial mentality with major media executives
and politicians while I was in the Philippines, so it was at least
temporarily in their minds. So yes, **[colonial mentality---particularly
skin-whitening---has been on many Filipinos' minds
lately.]{.underline}** But as Philippines Vice President Leny Robredo
acknowledged when I asked her about it, it's a centuries-old issue, and
there's been plenty of work on it, going as far back as Jose Rizal!
Indeed, many folks have documented and shared their painful stories,
struggles, confusions, and heartaches about colonial mentality
throughout the years. And [over the past 15 years, there has been some
efforts to quantify and "scientifically" capture colonial mentality
among Filipinos.]{.underline} First, there's the Colonial Mentality
Scale (CMS), which is a typical questionnaire that directly asks people
if they hold some signs of colonial mentality. [The CMS asks people to
indicate their level of agreement or disagreement with statements such
as, "**There are situations where I feel inferior because of my ethnic
background,"** "There are situations where I feel ashamed of my ethnic
background," \"I would like to have a skin tone that is lighter than the
skin tone I have,\" **"I make fun of, tease, or bad mouth Filipinos who
speak English with strong accents,\"** and **"Filipinos should be
thankful to Spain and the United States for transforming the Filipino
ways of life into a White/European American way of
life.\"**]{.underline} However, because people may easily lie, deny, or
not know too much about their own attitudes and behaviors to accurately
report it, I also developed the Colonial Mentality Implicit Association
Test (CMIAT), which attempts to capture whether Filipinos have strongly
and automatically associated Filipino culture with inferiority. Although
far from being complete and perfect, tools such as the CMS and CMIAT
have allowed us to attach some "numbers" to the very real stories that
people have been sharing for generations. And so, what does the data
tell us about colonial mentality among Filipinos? [Based on the CMS,
there seem to be at least five indicators of CM among Filipinos:
**Feelings of inferiority for being Filipino; Feelings of shame,
embarrassment, resentment, or self-hate about being a person of Filipino
heritage; Denigration of the Filipino body**]{.underline} (regarding
white physical characteristics as more attractive, advantageous, and
desirable than typical Filipino physical traits such as brown skin and
flat nose); **[Discriminating against less-westernized
Filipinos]{.underline}** (e.g., making fun of people from the
provinces---"Promdi"---or indigenous peoples and regarding them as
"backward"); and **[Tolerating or minimizing historical and contemporary
oppression of Filipinos]{.underline}** (because such oppression is
accepted as the appropriate cost of civilization). The CMS also allowed
us to have an estimate on how common CM is among Filipino Americans.
[When explicitly asked about colonial mentality, approximately 30
percent of Filipino Americans admitted to having at least one of the
five "symptoms" of colonial mentality.]{.underline} Only around 1
percent admitted feeling ashamed and embarrassed of their heritage, and
9.6 percent admitted to feeling inferior for being Filipino. Only around
3.5 percent admitted to discriminating against less-westernized
Filipinos, and 10.5 percent admitted to regarding Filipino physical
traits as less desirable than white physical traits. Finally, 16.4
percent admitted feeling fortunate for having been colonized and feeling
indebted to their past colonizers. However, when the CMIAT was used---a
more subtle and less-direct way of capturing CM---approximately 56
percent of Filipino Americans showed a tendency to automatically
associate inferiority with Filipino culture and superiority with
American culture. [In addition to providing us with what is probably a
more accurate estimate of the prevalence of CM among Filipinos, what the
CMIAT studies also suggest is that CM may exist and operate outside of
our awareness, intention, or control.]{.underline} In other words, it
seems as though many of us may have internalized the oppression of our
culture and ethnicity so deeply that it now exists and affects us
automatically. And as previously mentioned, CM has existed for
generations. [So how is it passed down intergenerationally? Research
suggests that our peers, family, and community seem to influence the
development of CM among Filipino Americans. **Overall 96 percent of
Filipino immigrants to the United States report being exposed to
Filipino inferiorizing messages while they were still living in the
Philippines.**]{.underline} Specifically, 85 percent reported seeing CM
from their family, 88 percent from their friends, and 90 percent from
their general community. [Perhaps the most egregious example of CM in
the Philippines is the abundance of skin-whitening products and clinics
being advertised and sold everywhere.]{.underline} And according to a
survey conducted by Synovate Philippines (2004, Skin Whitening in
Southeast Asia), at least 50 percent of Filipinos use skin-whitening
products. Furthermore, recent research also shows that skin-whitening
use is most common among Filipinas, and among the lower class and
less-educated people in the Philippines. **[Research also suggests that
current experiences of racism are also related to CM among Filipino
Americans.]{.underline}** [That is, the more Filipino Americans
experience the denigration of their culture and ethnicity, the more
likely they are to develop CM. And research shows that 99 percent of
Filipino Americans report experiencing racism in the past
year.]{.underline} Thus, it is very likely that many Filipino Americans
may hold CM. But so what if Filipinos have CM, and so what if they've
had CM for generations? [**Is having CM such a bad thing?** According to
the World Health Organization, **the use of skin-whitening has been
associated with mental and physical health damages.**]{.underline}
Overall, using tools such as the CMS and the CMIAT, CM has been shown to
relate to poorer mental health. Specifically, i[**t has been shown to be
related to lower levels of self-esteem, more depression symptoms, more
anxiety symptoms, and lower levels of life satisfaction**. These
correlates of CM are concerning as research also shows that they
typically co-occur with other troubling conditions like alcohol and drug
use, and poor school or job performance.]{.underline} So yes, having CM
is a bad thing. Although we have continued to improve our understanding
of CM, there are still plenty more research questions that we need to
explore concerning CM and its implications. I truly hope that the tools
we have now will make it easier for us to engage in these explorations,
and that more Filipinos will take up the task of tackling these
questions.

#### This form of imperialism is rooted in colonial history wherein orientalist tropes are deployed to discipline the world. The aff opens the space for refusing arms as a tool of oppression in the Philippines. 

**Mathur 2k14** (Ritu, professor of political science at university of
Texas san antonio 'The West and the Rest': A Civilizational Mantra in
Arms Control and Disarmament?, Contemporary Security Policy, 35:3,
332-355, DOI: 10.1080/13523260.2014.960164)

First Phase: Colonial Racism in Practices of Arms Control and
Disarmament It is argued that [from the late 18th century, the ideology
of laissez faire in arms gov- erned Western powers. According to this
ideology,  \... trade is seen as the source of wealth and power and the
engine of growth]{.underline} for sustained and enhanced productive
**[capacity; this would logically result in fewer direct restrictions on
arms transfers.]{.underline}** A shift to indirect political interven-
tion in the market also follows from this, and objections to the trade
in technol- ogy may even diminish, as long as the wellsprings of
technological innovation are not directly threatened.^58^ One might very
well question how this sense of threat emerged among the Western powers.
[The possession of colonies among the Western powers represented a
source of wealth and power. This very possession generated a sense of
vulnerability. The colonies provided the raw materials necessary for the
production of weapons and sol- diers to fight imperial wars. Thus, there
was a sense of fear that transfer of arms to the colonies might result
in their use against the colonial masters. A serious sense of threat
governed all imperial decisions, including transfer of arms, with regard
to maintaining control over the colonies]{.underline}. Thus, the
argument on 'free trade' in arms did not extend to the colonies lacking
freedom.  To further protect the 'well springs of technological
[innovation' education, fun- damental research in sciences or
development of indigenous scientific capabilities were deliberately
discouraged in the colonies.59 This]{.underline}, according to Albert
Memmi, [can be attributed to 'colonial racism'.60 The practices of
colonial racism deliberately emphasize and exploit the differences
between the colonized and the colonizers. They further seek to sustain
these differences, transforming them into]{.underline} irrefutable
standards of [fact that correspond with concrete realities to the
benefit of the colonial powers. It was these explicit practices of
colonial racism that made it impossible for the colo- nized to cultivate
any taste for 'mechanized civilization and a feeling for machin- ery'.61
A sense of 'technical inadequacy' was deliberately
cultivated]{.underline} as 'the colonizer pushed the colonized out of
the historical and social, cultural and technical current'.^62^ It was
under these circumstances of a deliberately created sense of tech- nical
inadequacy that: \[w\]hile it is pardonable for the colonizer to have
his little arsenals, the discov- ery of even a rusty weapon among the
colonized is cause for immediate punish- ment \... and nostalgia for
arms is always present, and is part of all ceremonies in Africa, from
north to south. The lack of implements of war appears pro- portional to
the size of the colonialist forces; the most isolated tribes are still
the first to pick up these weapons. This is not a proof of savagery, but
only evi- dence that the conditioning is not sufficiently
maintained.^63 ^

#### The otherization of Eastern nations and paternalistic mentality of the US drives Western exceptionalism, which seeks to cleanse the world in an effort to homogenize cultures and eliminate alterity, culminating in catastrophe and endless violence.

**Mathur 2k18** (Ritu, Dr Ritu Mathur is an Assistant Professor of
Political Science at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),
Techno-Racial dynamics of denial & difference in weapons control)

In an effort to generate critical self- reflexivity on practices of
Orientalism and Occidentalism there has been a proliferation of
discourses on 'strategic Orientalism', 'techno Orientalism' and
'military Orientalism' as discussed below**[. Keith Krause and Andrew
Latham (1998) argue that practices of 'strategic orientalism' constitute
the 'foundation of Western security culture' (Krause & Latham, 1998, p.
41). They assert that strategic orientalism is premised on the
'pervasive and axiomatic belief that the West (or occasionally the
United States) as a civilization has a special role to play in global
security affairs'']{.underline}** (Krause & Latham, 1998, pp. 41, 37).
This is based on 'a reading of the politico-strategic objectives and
purposes of Third World states that is informed more by Western fears
and prejudices than by the realities of politics in these states'
(Krause & Latham, 1998, p. 38). **[The deep-rooted fear of the attacking
Asian hordes and their ability to industrialize and develop
sophisticated weapons reinforces twenty-first century concerns about the
'Rising East'. This 'phenomenon of imagining Asia and Asians in hypo-or
hypertechnological]{.underline}** terms in cultural productions and
political discourse' is understood as 'techno-Orientalism' (Roh et al.,
2015, p. 2). **[Practices of techno-Orientalism driven by 'imperial
aspirations' and 'appetites of consumerist societies' are 'infused with
the languages and codes of the technological and futuristic' and in
'digital spaces abound with reinscribed racial tropes and stereotypes;
these are sites in which racialization is more likely reinforced than
challenged']{.underline}** (Roh et al., 2015, p. 14). Scholars
developing the concept of techno-Orientalism observe its 'growing
prevalence in the Western cultural consciousness' and suggest that the
'US techno Orientalist imagination has its roots in the view of Asian
body...as a form of expendable technology' (Roh et al., 2015, pp.
7--11). Nevertheless they insist that the scope of techno-Orientalism is
'expansive and bi-directional' and ponder on the 'danger that Asian and
Asian American creators...might internalize techno Orientalist patterns
and uncritically replicate the same dehumanizing model' (Roh et al.,
2015, pp. 3, 7). In investigating the intimacy of a relationship it
might be possible to glean and 'retrieve recessive images and practices'
that have been historically constituted through a network of social
relations and processes (Naeem & David, 2004, p. 191). These might
present creative opportunities to move beyond 'policing boundaries of
self as an exclusive and homogenous space' and instead 'appreciate and
claim the self that exists as part of the other beyond those boundaries'
(Naeem & David, 2004, p. 204). Porter insists on 'the interactive and
power-political nature of war, which has a culture of its own that can
change all parties to a conflict' (2013, p. 55). Porter claims that,
'paradoxically, war can drive cultures closer together' (2013, p. 33).
This is because, 'war...is not simply a clash of Others, made possible
by an ignorant horror of difference. The warrior looks out at the enemy
and sees men who are, in crucial respects, recognizably like himself'
(Porter, 2013, p. 34**[). He also argues that an engagement with, 'the
foreign "Other" can be treated as a superior model to inform
self-examination']{.underline}** (2013, p. 108). But this hopeful
promise of Military Orientalism has not stemmed the tide of populist
discourses deploying the dynamic of difference between '**[The West and
the Rest' in the aftermath of the Cold War to wage and perpetuate a
global War on Terror. On the contrary it is possible to argue that there
is deliberate and contingent deployment of a 'decivilizing rhetoric that
blends irrational, aggressive, rigid, paranoid and exceptionalist
discourses to demonize Other-ness' and give 'unwarranted authority
and]{.underline}** **[autonomy' to 'militarist and imperialist
discourses of national security']{.underline}** (Taylor, 2007, p. 670).
There is 'sustained use of decivilizing imagery' that 'represents the
United States as a virtuous nation reluctantly but legitimately
fulfilling its divine mandate to use civilized reason and superior
force' vis-a vis 'nuclear capable and aspiring nations in Asia, Africa
and the Middle East' depicted in a 'racist, sexist language that
reproduces colonial ideology. As such it rejects the authority and
legitimacy of these nations as potential possessors of nuclear weapons
and solidifies continued dominance by the United States of the nuclear
strategic environment' (Taylor, 2007, p. 685). The strength of these
populist discourses reinforcing a dynamic of difference and denial is
exhibited with the contemporary 'malpractice' of the Trump
administration to not respect the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran
(Kimball, 2018). **[Nuclear weapons have long been regarded as 'a new
technological deity' and 'a divinely offered gift that endorsed American
exceptionalism and imbued its creators with God-like power and the
mission to restore order and justice in a fallen world.']{.underline}**
(Taylor, 2007, p. 677). Gabrielle Hecht (2012) defines nuclear
exceptionalism as 'insistence on an essential nuclear difference --
manifested in political claims, technological systems, cultural forms,
institutional infrastructures, and scientific knowledge' and insists
'nuclear exceptionalism could be made, unmade, and remade' as 'for all
efforts at making nuclear things exceptional, there were opposing
attempts to render them banal' (Hecht, pp. 6-- 8). **[It is important to
bear this in mind as this pernicious dynamic of difference and
exceptionalism becomes even more acute with current US President Donald
Trump's everyday populist declarations. He is on record for stating that
the US will be at the 'top of the pack' 'until such time as the world
comes to its senses regarding nukes']{.underline}** (Holland, 2017). In
his recent visit to Poland 'to summon the courage and the will to defend
our civilization' **[Trump]{.underline}** (2017) **[claims 'there are
dire threats to our security and our way of life' and argues, 'the
fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to
survive.' There is little doubt in his mind of the 'triumph' of the
West]{.underline}** (Holland, 2017). It is therefore helpful to pause in
this tumultuous 'history of the present' and suggest that 'every
identity owes a debt to alterity' (Naeem & David, 2004, p. 8). Thus it
is interesting to observe how the existing literature on 'dynamic of
difference' between Orientalism and Occidentalism has expanded its
arsenal with a more complex conceptual apparatus of Strategic
Orientalism, Techno Orientalism and Military **[Orientalism to helps us
grasp the everyday practices of techno-racial dynamic of differences
that cultivate and nurture techno-racial stereotypes]{.underline}**.
**[These stereotypes more often than not dictate modes of behavior that
make the Other 'a monster that must not only be defeated but also
utterly destroyed...an enemy who no longer must be compelled to retreat
into his borders only']{.underline}** (Schmitt, 2007). It is this
'dynamic of difference' with its persistent desire to annihilate the
Other, makes one wonder, whether it is not a complementary sub-text for
an increasingly alarming and growing superstructure of a 'dynamic of
denial' in weapons control? A dynamic of denial so petulant that it
casts its shadow in celebrating the recent success of a Nuclear Weapons
Ban Treaty (2017).

### 1ac -- Response 

#### Thus we demand that all arms sales from the United States to the Philippines should be eliminated. 

#### Setting the framework for colonial understanding is key to shifting towards a more ethical and decolonial mindset. This makes debate the unique space for recognizing coloniality and placing accountability on those who perpetuate this violent disposition.

To Avoid "Ignorance" and "Innocence" Moves that Obscure Responsibility:
Clarifying Responsibilities [**Clarifying who is responsible for the
violence, and taking responsibility for it is an important part of the
teaching of colonial histories in a RIV framework**. In the context of
colonial history teaching, this does not mean that the identity crisis
potentially experienced by non-Native students, and the difficulty they
might encounter throughout the unsettling process of learning about
colonialism, should not be addressed.]{.underline} But a clear
understanding of who is the survivor and who is in position to continue
or stop the violence must be established. [A good example of ignorance
as colonial strategy is to ask to "put behind us" the colonial violence
as something of the past **("get over it")**]{.underline}, [rather than
"examining the cultural attitudes that influence understanding of the
responsibility that Canadian society bears" for colonial
violence]{.underline} (Regan, 2010, p. 42). In that sense, in the
classroom, it is crucial to establish an understanding and
acknowledgement of the racial burden and ongoing violence lived by
Indigenous students (Cote-Meek, 2014). [This understanding cannot occur
solely through lectures and readings, but requires holistic pedagogical
approaches that will allow a transformation in the students. **This is
why many authors have argued for the use of Indigenous pedagogies in the
classroom in order to address difficult materials and to achieve a
transformative, unsettling education towards
decolonization**]{.underline} (Battiste, 2013; Cote-Meek, 2014; Grande,
San Pedro, & Windchief, 2015; Henry, 2014; Irlbacher-Fox, 2014; Regan,
2010; Snelgrove, Kaur Dhamoon, & Corntassel, 2014; Waziyatawin & Yellow
Bird, 2005; Wildcat, McDonald, Irlbacher-Fox, & Coulthard, 2014).
However well intentioned, educators might feel unsure as to where to
begin. For example, the Department of Applied Human Sciences at
Concordia University held a Teaching Day on "Responding to the TRC Calls
to Action" on April 27, 2015, including a workshop on Contemporary
Indigenous Identities in Canada, with Suzanne Keeptwo, and debriefing
and reflection sessions led by a teaching team comprised of members of
the department (Dr. Elizabeth Fast, Dr. Rosemary Reilly, and Dr. Hilary
Rose). Part of the debriefing and reflection was centred on asking
participants about their needs for support when it comes to integrating
Indigenous content in their classrooms. One of the main findings that
came out of these discussions is that most faculty had little knowledge
of historical forces that impact the living conditions of Indigenous
peoples in Canada, and little confidence in their grasp of such basics
as proper terminology. They felt lacking in the background knowledge to
effectively manage discussions in the classroom. In that sense, there is
a profound contradiction between the fact that we encourage teachers to
include Indigenous content and colonial history in their curriculum, and
the reality that "the majority of teachers, like the majority of
Canadians, have a limited understanding of Aboriginal people, history,
and culture; rather their understanding is informed by dominant
discourses" (Dion, 2007, p. 330). There is thus a need to find ways for
professors to transform the way they relate to Canadian colonial
history, and the way they understand Indigenous peoples and their
relations with Canada, before they can teach their students how to do
so. This [lack of preparedness, lack of training, and the gap in
faculty's actual knowledge of colonial history and Indigenous peoples'
history can serve as a barrier to inclusion in course content, leading
to the thought that it is better to avoid the subject than to approach
it in a wrong way. **However, using our ignorance as an excuse to
absolve ourselves from the "responsibility of addressing our shared
colonial history"**]{.underline} (Regan, 2010, p. 33) **[is a "move to
innocence"]{.underline}** (Tuck & Yang, 2012) that only perpetuates
colonial violence. "Violent innocence" protects individuals,
organizations, institutions, and society at large from uncomfortable
truths (Regan, 2010). CoteMeek (2014) stressed the responsibility of
teachers when it comes to learning difficult knowledges: **["Educators
have a pedagogical and ethical responsibility to set the tone and
context of the classroom experience where students may be required to
bear witness to historical trauma"]{.underline}** (p. 150[). In an
academic context that "remains founded on epistemological practices and
traditions that are selective and exclusionary", it is the
responsibility not only of the teachers but also the entire educational
institution to overcome the "sanctioned ignorance of the academy at
large"]{.underline} (Kuokkanen, 2007, p. 1). In this regard, we need to
overcome the "scarcity" discourse that predominates in the academy
regarding available resources such as Indigenous authors, information
about Indigenous peoples' histories and cultures, and perspectives on
colonial histories. There are far more articles, books, films, websites,
blogs, and community resources available out there than most teachers
know about, and the oft-heard statement that there are no Indigenous
authors in a given discipline only contributes to the violent erasure of
Indigenous peoples' intellectual traditions and contributions to the
academy.

the United States would not ignore Chinese behavior. [The Pentagon

[The Trump administration's arms sale strategy to the Philippines and

of the broader aspect of a "long-term" defense partnership.]{.underline}
This was stressed by US State for Arms Control and International
Security Affairs Undersecretary Andrea Thomson during a telephonic
interview with journalists on Monday. "[So the sales reflect it, but
it's much broader than that.]{.underline} It's not only a product but
more importantly, a partnership. So when you have that relationship with
the United States and are looking to buy that military equipment, it's
an indicator of a long term defense cooperation," Thomson said. [Thomson
explained that the new strategy rolled out by US President Donald Trump
in 2018, called the Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) policy, added
efficiencies and transparency in both their foreign military sales and
direct commercial sales processes]{.underline}. The US official met with
their counterparts in the Southeast Asian region at the sidelines of the
just concluded Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore. "We're getting very
positive feedback from our partners and allies that it's ensuring that
it gets them the right equipment at the right time for the right
mission," she said. In the case of the Philippines, the US official
noted the incredible importance of equipment related to maritime
security and its fight against terrorism. The Philippines, alongside
Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei, and China are locked in territorial
claims in the South China Sea. [Thomson said the US government was
looking forward to the "next steps" that the Philippines will take in
terms of its procurement of American military equipment.]{.underline}

#### Duterte confirms. 

**Kabiling, 6/9** (Genalyn, 7-3-2019, \"PRRD considers purchase of
military arsenal from US,\" Manila Bulletin News,
https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/06/09/prrd-considers-purchase-of-military-arsenal-from-us/)

[The Philippines may purchase weapons and other military hardware from
the United States in case it needs a particular type of arsenal,
President Duterte said]{.underline} over the weekend. The President
decided to reconsider the United States as one of the country's arms
suppliers after [affirming that he respects]{.underline} US President
Donald [Trump]{.underline} and the country's alliance with its western
ally. "[Well, America has been helpful. In the purchase of arms, we have
a bad experience but they have a new policy now]{.underline}. We're
going to reconsider," he said during his appearance at the "Give Us This
Day" television program of his friend evangelist Apollo Quiboloy last
Saturday. "[We'll buy if we think we need that kind of particular
(equipment)]{.underline}," Duterte added. In January, the President
announced he would no longer buy weapons from the United States over
threats to impose sanctions against any country trading arms with Russia
and China. He said the government was inclined to buy weapons from other
countries such as Israel and South Korea. In the television interview
last Saturday, the President explained that the country sought "cheaper
and better arms" after the botched rifle deal with the United States. He
recalled that Russia and China offered assistance to the country when
the terror siege in Marawi City occurred in 2017. He added that the
country honored the contracts with these nations despite a US threat to
impose sanctions. "I'd like to say to the Americans and to the officials
sa --- in Washington, when you deprived us of the arms, we started going
around scouting for cheaper and better arms. And there were contracts
already, memorandum of intent --- intent to buy something like that so
we will not impair that obligation," he said. "Because Trump has just
issued a --- that you are prohibited to buy. I'm sorry but ganito 'yan
eh. When we needed, in the hour of our need, we needed the arms, Russia
and China gave it to us practically free. Then, you know I'm a Filipino.
You have to have a sense of gratitude. At least honor the contract.
Nothing else," he added. The President said the Philippines would keep
its traditional ties with the United States and won't do anything that
will hamper such alliance. "I'm just saying it because I like Trump and
I would like to assure America that we will not do anything to hinder,
hamper, or whatever. We will go along with our alliances," Duterte said.
"I do not have a problem with Trump, that much I respect him," he added.

rivalry** between Washington and Beijing.]{.underline} Since China has
pushed forward Code of Conduct (COC) negotiations and developed maritime
cooperation with the Philippines and Vietnam---two important
stakeholders in the SCS territorial disputes---[ASEAN states should
continue to work together with China to maintain the peace and stability
of the SCS. The US has attempted to hinder China's desire for growing
military influence in the region by militarizing the Southeast Asian
states]{.underline}---a difficult task that has not met with much
success. [Not only that**, the fragile balance of forces in the region,
as well as the peace and stability in the SCS, would be threatened by
America's growing arms exports to the region**. The military rivalry
between the US and China would also be intensified by a renewed arms
race. In this context, **Washington should** be fully **aware of
Beijing's rising concerns about US arms sales to Southeast Asian
countries.**]{.underline} Apart from the recent American arms deals with
Southeast Asian nations, new actions have been taken by the US to deter
China in the SCS. Following the joint drill between the US, Japan, the
Philippines, and India in the SCS last month, the US Coast Guard Cutter
Bertholfand two vessels from the Philippine Coast Guard conducted the
first joint search and rescue exercise near the Huangyan islands that
China has claimed in Scarborough Shoal. At that point, US Vice Admiral
Linda Fagan, commander of the Coast Guard's Pacific Area, announced that
the US Navy had sent the Coast Guard vessels to monitor China's military
activities in the SCS. The significance of the US Coast Guard's
emergence into the SCS is that the US has started to maximize the
overall level of its deterrence capability in the region. As Linda Fagan
said, "The US Coast Guard is proud to operate with our Pacific
counterparts, and together we are dedicated to enhancing our
capabilities and strengthening maritime governance and security while
promoting individual sovereignty\...This type of engagement gives us a
great opportunity to share our experiences and learn from our partners
in the Philippine Coast Guard."Since the US overtly claimed that Chinese
militias are a kind of government force, [it is likely that the US Coast
Guard might escalate tensions when encountering Chinese militia
groups.]{.underline} [To conclude, the **America's greater involvement
in the SCS issue will cause more confrontations** between Washington and
Beijing, thus creating a deteriorating security situation in the region.
Given this risk, the US should exercise restraint and avoid provoking
China by taking aggressive actions in the SCS.]{.underline} China should
enhance the transparency of its military deployment on SCS islands and
strengthen military exchanges with both the US and the Southeast Asian
countries so as to relieve their concerns about the "China threat."
China should also develop a contingency plan for properly handling
potential emergencies in the SCS. At this juncture, it is necessary for
China and the US to discuss the possible serious consequences of the use
of military drones as well as the presence of the US Coast Guard in the
SCS, and establish crisis-management mechanisms so as to prevent
conflicts from happening.

### Drones

#### Drones -- we sold them last month -- production will continue through 2022. 

**Stone 6/4** (Mike, Reuters, 6-4-2019, \"US to sell surveillance drones

https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/06/04/19/us-to-sell-surveillance-drones-to-philippines-south-china-sea-allies)

WASHINGTON \-- [The Trump administration has moved ahead with a
surveillance drone sale to]{.underline} 4 US allies in [the South China
Sea region]{.underline} as acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan
said [Washington will no longer \"tiptoe\" around Chinese
behavior]{.underline} in Asia. The drones would afford greater
intelligence gathering capabilities potentially curbing Chinese activity
in the region. Shanahan did not directly name China when making
accusations of \"actors\" destabilizing the region in a speech at the
annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Saturday but went on to say
the United States would not ignore Chinese behavior. [The Pentagon
announced on Friday it would sell 34 ScanEagle drones, made by Boeing
Co. to]{.underline} the governments of Malaysia, Indonesia, [the
**Philippines**]{.underline} and Vietnam for a total of \$47 million.
[China claims almost all of the strategic South China Sea and frequently
lambastes the United States and its allies over naval operations near
Chinese-occupied islands]{.underline}. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, [the
Philippines]{.underline}, Taiwan and Vietnam [have competing
claims]{.underline}. [The Pentagon said Friday\'s sales included spare
and repair parts, support equipment, tools, training and technical
services and work on the equipment was expected to be **completed by
March 2022**]{.underline}. [As many as 12 unarmed drones and equipment
would go to Malaysia]{.underline} for about \$19 million. Indonesia, the
world\'s largest Muslim-majority country would buy 8 drones**[, the
Philippines 8]{.underline}**, and Vietnam 6. In 2018, US President
Donald Trump\'s administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of US
arms export policy aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it would
bolster the American defense industry and create jobs at home.

### MDT

#### US-Philippines MDT being renegotiated -- US needs to commit or Philippines will scrap.

Last month, at his end-of-year press conference, the [Philippine
Secretary of National Defense]{.underline} Delfin Lorenzana
[[called](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/12/21/1878729/defense-chief-seeks-philippine-us-treaty-review)
for a review of the 1951 U.S.-Philippine]{.underline} Mutual Defense
Treaty ([MDT]{.underline}). [Under the terms of this treaty, either side
can unilaterally withdraw. When asked if post-review options included
the Philippines "scrapping" the treaty, Lorenzana's
[reply](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/28/18/scrap-ph-us-treaty-lets-see-lorenzana)
was ambivalent]{.underline}: [**Let's see ...** We are going to approach
this MDT, look at it in the backdrop of what's happening in the area, in
the interest of the nation]{.underline}, not the interest of other
nations. The timing of the call for the review is a surprise. The call
came just after the U.S., earning very [rare
praise](https://www.rappler.com/nation/218985-duterte-balangiga-bells-return-eastern-samar-december-15-2018)
from President Rodrigo Duterte, returned the [Balangiga
bells](https://www.philstar.com/the-freeman/opinion/2018/12/16/1877444/importance-returning-balangiga-bells)
to the Philippines more than a century after American colonialist had
removed them from the Philippines. The MDT also recently proved its
irreplaceable worth during the five-month terrorist siege of Marawi City
in 2017. The U.S. involvement has been
[recognised](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/medias/commentaries/item/6469-end-of-marawi-siege-underscores-critical-importance-ofusphilippine-alliance-by-ian-storey)
by the Armed Forces of the Philippines as "shifting the balance" in
favour of the government forces. The person making the call is an even
bigger surprise, and cause of concern for MDT supporters. While [Duterte
has criticised the MDT and the U.S. for the duration of his term in
office, many, [including Duterte
himself](https://news.mb.com.ph/2017/09/27/my-dnd-chief-is-a-us-agent-duterte/),
have seen Lorenzana as the strongest MDT supporter]{.underline}.
Lorenzana's bombshell is the Philippine equivalent, in effect, to if
James Mattis, when he was U.S. Secretary of Defense, had called for the
review and possible scrapping of a U.S. alliance. Over a quarter century
ago, the Philippines unilaterally weakened its commitment to the MDT by
not renewing the leases on the U.S. bases in the country, thus removing
the major strategic benefit for the U.S. of the treaty. Now, according
to Lorenzana, [the **Philippines wants the U.S. to strengthen its
commitments** under the MDT by extending it to cover the sovereignty
claims of the Philippines in the South China Sea that were made long
after the MDT was ratified.]{.underline} This at a time when Lorenzana's
boss has declared his personal love for Xi Jinping and personal
separation from the U.S., casting further doubt on the commitment to the
MDT of the current Philippine government.

#### Philippines will scrap the MDT if American support is seen as wavering.

A [storm is brewing in America's oldest security alliance in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline} and the administration needs to act quickly to
head it off. On December 20, [Philippine Secretary of National Defense
Delfin Lorenzana [called
for](http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/12/20/Philippines-U.S.-Mutual-Defense-Treaty-South-China-Sea-dispute.html)
a review of the provisions of the]{.underline} 1951 Mutual Defense
Treaty ([MDT]{.underline}) between Washington and Manila. A week later,
[[he confirmed](http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1057639) that Philippine
government lawyers had been tasked to study ways to "maintain it,
strengthen it, **or scrap it."**]{.underline} The [primary reason for
this review is what Lorenzana called America's "ambivalence" about
whether the treaty applies in the South China Sea]{.underline}, where
Philippine troops and facilities are under threat from an increasingly
assertive China. In a [Jan. 8
interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAYwsPKCLOc), [Lorenzana
reiterated that if America won't clarify the treaty's scope, then
scrapping it altogether is "an option.]{.underline}" That would be a
severe blow to U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific and a largely
self-inflicted wound by Washington. Lorenzana and the defense
establishment in [Manila are unlikely to demand actual amendments to the
MDT]{.underline}. Doing so, even if the negotiations were successful,
would require ratification by the U.S. and Philippine senates, which
seems unlikely in the current political climates in both capitals. [What
they seem to want is a public clarification of U.S. policy regarding the
application of the treaty to the South China Sea,]{.underline} hopefully
accompanied by new guidelines to modernize and operationalize the treaty
for the current threat environment. Given Washington's interests in
countering Beijing's illegal claims and militarization of the South
China Sea and the continued utility of the U.S.-Philippine alliance,
Manila's concerns should be seen as entirely reasonable and Washington
should move quickly to resolve them.

#### Duterte will squeeze concessions out of America to make the MDT stronger.

The [Philippine defense chief,]{.underline} who spent more than a decade
as a diplomat in Washington, [made clear that scrapping the alliance
altogether is definitely an option]{.underline}. The treaty allows for
unilateral nullification of the agreement within a year of notice. But
Lorenzana\'s actions may be more subtle than they seem. [He is almost
certainly not seeking to break the alliance.]{.underline} [But by
putting the possibility on the table he has a chance of forcing the
pro-China lobby around Duterte out into the open \-- and pressing these
officials to state clearly what kind of security arrangement they seek
and how will this protect the country\'s vital interests]{.underline},
particularly in the South China Sea. If they balk at the prospect of
saying bluntly that they would rather trust China than the U.S., this
will undermine their arguments and end up strengthening the traditional
ties. At the same time, [such a strategy might **squeeze some
concessions out of Washington to improve what is now a vague mutual
defense accord**.]{.underline} Of course, Lorenzana is running risks
given the unpredictability of both Duterte and U.S. President Donald
Trump. But, he is right to try \-- because the current deal with
Washington desperately needs a much-needed boost.

### China War Impacts

#### China war [escalates]{.underline} and causes [extinction]{.underline}

**White 19**(Hugh, Former Australian DOD, Professor Strategic Studies @
Australian National University, 3-6, "**[Can the US win the new cold war
with China? Not without risking a nuclear war]{.underline}**," South
China Morning Post,
https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2188648/can-us-win-new-cold-war-china-not-without)n

Declaring a new cold war against China is easy, but working out how to
fight it and win it is much harder. While almost everyone in Washington
these days seems to agree that resisting China's seemingly insatiable
ambition is now America's highest strategic priority, the nature and
scale of the task is still enveloped in uncertainty. No one seems too
worried about this, however, because [they assume that a new cold war
with China is going to be easy to win]{.underline}. The [few attempts we
have seen to formulate a strategy to against China]{.underline}, from
think-tankers' policy papers to Congress' recent Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act (ARIA), [radiate confidence that America can defeat
China's challenge by doing just a little bit more of the things it has
been doing in Asia for decades]{.underline}. The talk is of closer links
to allies, more active partnerships with friends, more military
deployments and increased economic and people-to-people links. But [this
is just what America has been saying and doing for years, and none of it
has worked to stop China's growing influence]{.underline}. America need
not go to war with China to defeat its challenge, but it must convince
Beijing that it is willing and able to do so By expecting to win this
way, [today's new cold warriors massively underestimate
China]{.underline}. [That is a huge mistake]{.underline}, reflecting
major misunderstandings of China's power, ambitions and resolve. When
these are properly understood, it becomes clear that America faces a
huge and daunting task if it is really serious about confronting and
containing China's ambitions in East Asia. The new cold war could be
just as hard and dangerous and costly as the old cold war was. Let's
start by being clear what the contest is really about. US officials --
like Vice-President Mike Pence in Munich recently -- often talk as if
America's problem with China concerns specific Chinese policies, like
its expansive maritime claims and predatory economic policies. US
Vice-President Mike Pence crosses a street to give a statement in front
of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof at the 55th Munich Security Conference on
February 16. At the conference, Pence called on world leaders to reject
Huawei, calling it a threat to critical telecoms infrastructure. Photo:
AFP US Vice-President Mike Pence crosses a street to give a statement in
front of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof at the 55th Munich Security
Conference on February 16. At the conference, Pence called on world
leaders to reject Huawei, calling it a threat to critical telecoms
infrastructure. Photo: AFP Share: If so, success would simply mean
convincing Beijing to abandon these policies, and then all will be well
again. But these specific issues are no more the real driver of US-China
rivalry than the status of Danzig was the cause of the second world war.
They are just the symptoms of a far bigger dispute with much greater
stakes for both sides, over which of them dominates East Asia. Very
simply, America wants to remain East Asia's preponderant power, and
China wants to take its place. [This is a contest]{.underline}, then,
[between the world's two most powerful states over the leadership of the
world's most prosperous and dynamic region.]{.underline} Compared to
that, the disputes over maritime law or intellectual property dwindle to
insignificance. The second thing to understand is the strength of the
Chinese resolve to win this contest. It springs from their deep sense of
the kind of country China is. Americans tend still to see China as a
poor, weak country -- albeit one which has unexpectedly and temporarily
struck it rich. But the Chinese have never stopped thinking of
themselves as a great power, and see their recent rise as the natural
restoration of their traditional place at the apex of wealth and power.
So while Americans see a US preponderance in Asia as natural and proper,
the Chinese see it as unnatural, anachronistic -- and insufferable. To
see how insufferable, recall Henry Kissinger's acute observation many
years ago that the US-China relationship is driven less by the two
counties' differences than by their similarities -- especially their
similar images of themselves as international actors. Imagine how
Americans would feel if China dominated the western hemisphere the way
America has dominated East Asia. That gives some idea of how determined
the Chinese are to push America out of its region and take its place.
The third thing to understand is China's power. It is the strongest
adversary America has ever faced, and getting steadily stronger. Like
any country, the foundations of its power is its economy, which is
already far bigger, relative to America's, than the Soviet Union was at
its height. Before long, it will almost certainly overtake America
altogether. What the US needs to fear most is Chinese fear itself Of
course [China has serious economic, political and social problems, but
to assume that they will stop, let alone reverse, its rise to power is
pure wishful thinking.]{.underline} So is the assumption that [China's
economic weight -- and its fast-growing technological
expertise]{.underline} -- [will]{.underline} not [translate into
formidable diplomatic weight and military power]{.underline}. Indeed
they already have. None of this means that China will soon "rule the
world". But it [does make China a truly formidable adversary, and it
**raises deep questions about whether America can credibly expect to
succeed in preserving the old US-led order in Asia** in the face of
China's determination to overturn it.]{.underline}

[Claimant countries]{.underline} clearly [do not accept Chinese hegemony
in the area]{.underline}. Meanwhile, China --- the dominant power in the
region --- has given a tacit recognition to its neighbours\' claims. For
now, only one thing is clear: **[The nuclear option]{.underline}**, if
at all, [**should never be left to** some **ego-tripping
generals**]{.underline}. Civilians would suffer the most in such a
horrific scenario. With [heightened presence of warships]{.underline},

issue. But in a shooting war, Asean would suffer the most. Good fences
make good neighbours. That\'s why a code of conduct is immensely helpful
to all parties[. Leaders must work out clear rules they can adhere to
and which can be enforced]{.underline}. It also can never be denied:
China today has become the world\'s factory. It leads in AI, computing,
construction technology, renewables, electric vehicles. By opening up to
the world, China has lifted hundreds of millions of its citizens out of
poverty. The \"Middle Kingdom\" today swims in cash: Chinese foreign
exchange reserves stood at \$3.099 trillion in March, bigger than any
other country. This Chinese miracle offers valuable lessons and benefits
for the world. Here\'s the broader picture[: The list of territorial
disputes between nations is long. Responsible **leaders**, therefore,
**must** constantly **strive to let cooler heads and good reason
prevail**. **Doing otherwise**]{.underline} --- or an outright mischief

### AT: freedom of navigation

#### No freedom of navigation turn.

**Bandow 19**(Doug, JD @ Stanford, Senior Fellow @ CATO, 4-7, "The
Philippines \"Mutual\" Defense Treaty Isn\'t Really Mutual at All,"
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/skeptics/philippines-mutual-defense-treaty-isnt-really-mutual-all-50772)n

The [best argument for American involvement in territorial disputes is
to protect freedom of navigation]{.underline}. To assert Washington's
commitment to that principle, the Pentagon has mounted Freedom of
Navigation Operations---sending ships through waters claimed by Beijing.
Adding security guarantees for this purpose is a significant escalation.
Said Secretary Pompeo: "I think the whole world understands that the
Trump administration has made a true commitment to making sure that
these seas remain open for the security of the countries in the region
and the world, open to commercial transit." However, [Beijing has shown
no interest in ending commerce which greatly benefits all states and
peoples in the region]{.underline}. That would change in wartime, but
then none of today'sz rules would apply. [Nor does freedom of navigation
warrant taking Manila's side in its territorial dispute]{.underline}.
[There is no inherent reason to choose one side or the
other]{.underline}, though the Philippines appears to have the better
case. Anyway, American preference for Filipino control is not enough to
bestow the de jure right to the islets. [Washington could scarcely claim
to believe in the rule of law if it sought to oust China from plausibly
Chinese islands in order to shrink Chinese territorial waters.
Washington's primary interest in the shoal is to support the peaceful
resolution of international disputes]{.underline}. But [that does not
warrant a willingness to fight China,]{.underline} especially when the
latter has far more at stake than does America.

## Democracy Adv

### Rule of Law

#### Duterte erodes the justice system and rule of law---the military and police enforce his will

**Timberman 19**. David G. Timberman, independent scholar and
development practitioner who has addressed the challenges of democratic
politics and governance in Southeast Asia for over thirty years.
"Philippine Politics Under Duterte: A Midterm Assessment." Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. January 10, 2019.
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/01/10/philippine-politics-under-duterte-midterm-assessment-pub-78091>.
EG.

As mayor of a city that at times was wracked by political and criminal
violence, [Duterte considered the police to be a central pillar of his
government.]{.underline} He **[established close relationships with many
in the police and gained an intimate understanding of how the police
operate]{.underline}**. Thus, it is not surprising that Duterte and the
PNP have a symbiotic relationship. In the context of Duterte's drug
war[, individual police officers face difficult choices]{.underline}.
Journalist Sheila Coronel describes the complex considerations that
influence police behavior today: Policemen [weigh the continually
shifting balance of incentives and risks as they seek to deter crime,
advance their careers, please their political patrons, and make
money,]{.underline} while also evading exposure and prosecution. Yet in
the end, these policemen often also believe they are upholding order and
helping keep the peace. **[They are specialists in
violence---practitioners in the skills of lethal force---who improvise
often morally and legally questionable workarounds to the constraints of
a broken justice system.]{.underline}**33 [The longer-term consequences
for law enforcement from the war on drugs may be highly
damaging.]{.underline} The Brookings Institution's Vanda Felbab-Brown
has warned about its potentially corrupting influence: [Inducing police
to engage in de facto shoot-to-kill policies is **enormously corrosive
of law enforcement, not to mention the rule of law.**]{.underline} There
is a high chance that the policy will more than ever institutionalize
top-level corruption, as only powerful drug traffickers will be able to
bribe their way into upper-levels of the Philippine law enforcement
system. . . . Moreover, corrupt top-level cops and government officials
tasked with such witch-hunts will [have the perfect opportunity to
direct law enforcement against their drug business rivals as well as
political enemies]{.underline}, and themselves become the top drug
capos.34 Moreover, assuming that eventually there will be a president
who no longer sanctions EJKs by the police, **[the seeds have been
planted for a potentially divisive and dangerous debate over how to
handle human rights abuses that the PNP carried out during the Duterte
era.]{.underline}** Other collateral damage. Duterte's war on drugs has
had less dramatic but significant consequences for other aspects of
governance in the Philippines, **[including the justice system, public
health, and local governance.]{.underline}** Impact on the justice
system. **[The war on drugs has further stressed the Philippines'
overburdened justice system]{.underline}**. The [volume of cases to be
investigated, prosecuted, and tried, as well as the number of alleged
offenders awaiting trial in detention facilities, has increased
dramatically]{.underline}. A comprehensive picture of the impact on the
justice system is beyond the scope of this working paper, but some of
the available data point to these burdens. [In 2016, there were 28,000
drug arrests---a 44 percent increase over 2015---and more than 47,300
drug-related cases were filed.35 During the first 10 months of 2017, the
Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency conducted 34,744 drug enforcement
operations, with 66,672 arrests.]{.underline}36 In 2017, about 70,700
drug-related cases were filed in court, and about 21,400 were
reviewed.37 According to the Supreme Court, as of 2017 more than 289,000
drug cases had been filed in the country's lower courts.38 As a result,
**[drug suspects and convicts are crammed into the Philippines' already
packed jails and prisons.]{.underline}** According to the Department of
Justice's Bureau of Corrections, in 2017 the national prison system held
41,500 inmates, more than double its capacity. Data from the Bureau of
Jail Management and Penology, which oversees provincial and municipal
jails, show an even more disturbing situation. As of May 2018, there
were over 141,000 detainees---of which about 70 percent were
drug-related cases---held in jails that were 582 percent overcapacity.39
Ultimately, **[the legal dimensions of the war on drugs will test not
only the capacity of the justice system, but also the jurisprudence,
values, and autonomy of the Philippine judiciary]{.underline}**. In
November 2018, a Regional Trial Court issued the first legal judgment
against the PNP, finding three policemen guilty of murdering Kian Delos
Santos, a seventeen-year-old the policemen claimed was a drug runner who
resisted arrest. Currently, there is one case before the Supreme Court
challenging the constitutionality of the PNP's official plan for
eradicating illegal drugs.

EG.

The Duterte [government's track record regarding human rights and
democracy is undoubtedly disturbing]{.underline}. It has run
**[roughshod over human rights, its political opponents, and the
country's democratic institutions.]{.underline}** The combination of the
Philippines' powerful presidency and the malleability of most of its
political institutions is **[resulting in significant democratic
backsliding]{.underline}**. But to focus only on Duterte fails to
appreciate two other important elements: [the extent to which this
degradation has happened through nominally legal means, and the limited
pushback to date by groups and institutions opposed to strongman
rule]{.underline}. This working paper takes an in-depth look at the
complex dynamics contributing to democratic backsliding in the
Philippines. The Duterte administration's assault on human rights and
democracy also [raises the question of what the U.S. government and
America's nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) **can and should do to
defend democracy** in America's former colony]{.underline}. The analysis
concludes with a [discussion of **America's extremely limited support
for human rights and democracy in the Philippines** since Duterte became
president and offers suggestions for a more robust
response.]{.underline}

#### Democracy solves [extinction]{.underline}

[As]{.underline} one of the [countless millions]{.underline} of people
who [were]{.underline} freed or [protected from totalitarianism by the
United States]{.underline} of America, [it is easy for me to talk about
the past]{.underline}. To talk about the belief of the American people
and their leaders that this country was exceptional, and had special
responsibilities to match its tremendous power. [That a nation founded
on freedom was bound to defend freedom everywhere]{.underline}. I could
talk about the bipartisan legacy of this most American principle, from
the Founding Fathers, to Democrats like Harry Truman, to Republicans
like Ronald Reagan. I could talk about how the American people used to
care deeply about human rights and dissidents in far-off places, and how
this is what made America a beacon of hope, a shining city on a hill.
[America led by example and set a high standard, a standard that exposed
the hypocrisy and cruelty of dictatorships around the world. But there
is no time for nostalgia]{.underline}. Since the fall of the Berlin
Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War,
[Americans]{.underline}, and America, [have retreated from those
principles, and **the world has become much worse off as a
result**]{.underline}. American skepticism about America's role in the
world deepened in the long, painful wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and
their aftermaths. Instead of applying the lessons learned about how to
do better, lessons about faulty intelligence and working with native
populations, the main outcome was to stop trying. This result has been a
tragedy for the billions of people still living under authoritarian
regimes around the world, and it is based on faulty analysis. You can
never guarantee a positive outcome--- not in chess, not in war, and
certainly not in politics. The best you can do is to do what you know is
right and to try your best. I speak from experience when I say that the
citizens of unfree states do not expect guarantees. They want a reason
to hope and a fighting chance. [People living under dictatorships want
the opportunity for freedom]{.underline}, the opportunity to live in
peace and to follow their dreams. From the Iraq War to the Arab Spring
to the current battles for liberty from Venezuela to Eastern Ukraine,
people are fighting for that opportunity, giving up their lives for
freedom. [The United States must not abandon them. The United States and
the rest of the free world has an unprecedented advantage in economic
and military strength today. What is lacking is the will.]{.underline}
The will to make the case to the American people, [the will to take
risks and invest in the long-term security of the country, and the
world]{.underline}. This will require investments in aid, in education,
in security that allow countries to attain the stability their people so
badly need. Such investment is far more moral and far cheaper than the
cycle of [**terror, war**, refugees, and **military
intervention**]{.underline} that [results when America leaves a vacuum
of power.]{.underline} The best way to help refugees is to prevent them
from becoming refugees in the first place. The Soviet Union was an
existential threat, and this focused the attention of the world, and the
American people. There [**existential threat** today is not found on a
map, but it **is very real**.]{.underline} The [forces of the past are
making steady progress against the modern world order. **Terrorist**
movements in the Middle East, extremist parties across Europe, a
paranoid tyrant in **North Korea threatening nuclear blackmail,**
and]{.underline}, at the center of the web, [an **aggressive KGB
dictator in Russia**. They all want to turn the world back to a dark
past because their survival is threatened by]{.underline} the [values of
the free world, epitomized by the United States. And **they are thriving
as the U.S. has retreated**.]{.underline} The global freedom index has
declined for ten consecutive years. No one like to talk about the United
States as a global policeman, but [**this is what happens when there is
no cop on the beat. American leadership begins at home**, right here.
America cannot lead the world on democracy and human rights if there is
no unity on]{.underline} the [meaning and importance of these things.
**Leadership is required to make that case clearly and powerfully**.
Right now, Americans are engaged in politics at a level not seen in
decades. It is an opportunity for them to rediscover that making America
great begins with believing America can be great.]{.underline} The Cold
War was won on American values that were shared by both parties and
nearly every American. Institutions that were created by a Democrat,
Truman, were triumphant forty years later thanks to the courage of a
Republican, Reagan. This bipartisan consistency created the decades of
strategic [stability]{.underline} that [is the great strength of
democracies. Strong institutions that outlast politicians allow for
long-range planning]{.underline}. In contrast, dictators can operate
only tactically, not strategically, because they are not constrained by
the balance of powers, but cannot afford to think beyond their own
survival. This is why a dictator like Putin has an advantage in chaos,
the ability to move quickly. This can only be met by strategy, by
long-term goals that are based on shared values, not on polls and cable
news. The fear of making things worse has paralyzed the United States
from trying to make things better. There will always be setbacks, but
the United States cannot quit. [The spread of **democracy is the only**
proven **remedy for** nearly **every crisis that plagues the world
today. War, famine, poverty, terrorism**--all are generated and
exacerbated by authoritarian regimes]{.underline}. A policy of [America
First inevitably puts American security last. **American leadership is
required because there is no one else**]{.underline}, and because it is
good for America. [There is no weapon or wall that is more powerful for
security than America being envied, imitated, and admired around the
world. Admired not for being perfect, but for having the exceptional
courage to always try to be better]{.underline}. Thank you.

## Militarism Adv

### Human Rights IL

#### The US' continued military aid to the Philippines has continued to prioritize geopolitical interests over the lives of civilians leading to the increased support of authoritarian crackdowns elsewhere

**Gallagher et al. 19** \[Adrian Gallagher, University of Leeds, Euan

Maulana, University of Leeds & University of Yogyakarta, "Failing to
fulfil the responsibility to protect: the war on drugs as crimes against
humanity in the Philippines," Taylor & Francis, 1-31-2019
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09512748.2019.1567575\]//AT

The article developed in two sections. First, it evidences that
[**crimes against humanity are taking place in the Philippines** through
an analysis of three themes, (i) extrajudicial killings and vigilante
justice, (ii) dehumanisation, and (iii) the exaggeration of
threat]{.underline}. The role of the government looms large as Duterte's
regime has played a facilitative role in the mass violence which we
argue fulfils the legal requirement of 'course of conduct' set out in
Article 7 paragraph 2 (a) of the Rome Statute. From an RtoP perspective,
this constitutes a 'manifest failing' which begs the question, what is
the international community doing about it? The second part of the
article demonstrates that [the implicit and explicit support from the p5
and ASEAN undermine the international efforts made by the UN, the EU,
and the ICC. The US, the UK, and France have all **prioritised
bi-lateral trade relations and the counter-terrorism
norm**]{.underline}, whilst China has openly supported the war on drugs
and, along with Russia, see any interference as a violation of state
sovereignty. Echoing the latter position, ASEAN views this as a matter
of domestic jurisdiction and despite the allegations of crimes against
humanity, treats this in the same light as any other anti-drug campaign.
This leads us to conclude that [there is a significant protection
deficit as the government of the Philippines]{.underline}, **[the p5,
and ASEAN are all failing to protect the victims in the
Philippines.]{.underline}** Placing the case study in the broader
context of international relations, we finish by raising three points.
First, more research is needed on the relationship between anti-drug
campaigns and mass atrocity prevention. [This feeds into concerns raised
by the former UN Secretary-General's Special Adviser on the RtoP
regarding its future and how the international community understands
different types of mass violence]{.underline} (Welsh, 2018, p. 990). We
are not saying here that the RtoP should be extended to cover new
crimes, but instead highlight that in the future we may see more
atrocity crimes committed in contexts which differ dramatically from the
traditional benchmark of Rwanda and Srebrenica. [Consider that over the
past year, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia **have all looked to the
Philippines with a view to 'replicate the success'**]{.underline} (the
words of the Sri Lankan government) in their war on drugs (Beaumont,
2018; Gupta and Pokharel, 2018; Kine, 2017). With this in mind,
approaches to mass atrocity prevention, for 20 A. GALLAGHER ET. AL.
example, which highlight 'risk' and 'trigger' factors need to be able to
address these challenges. Second, **[the case study is part of a larger
concern over the military assistance being provided to states despite
their human rights record.]{.underline}** The initial hope was that the
RtoP would act as a rallying cry to galvanise international support
(Evans, 2008). Over the years, even those that defend the RtoP have
accepted that there is little evidence for this (Bellamy, 2013), but at
the same time, argue that the norm is part of boarder human protection
regime that is helping to reduce mass violence around the world
(Bellamy, 2016). However, in 2018, the United Nations and the World Bank
published its major study (1976--2016) identifying a 'dramatic
resurgence' of violent conflict especially in Africa and the Middle
East. This resurgence challenges the Pinker (2010) narrative that the
world is more peaceful than ever before. Trying to make sense of this,
some analysts have been keen to stress the return of realpolitik (if
indeed it ever went away) to explain the new era of changing power
balances[. It would seem that liberal democracies, including the
US]{.underline}, the UK, France, Canada, and Australia [are all
providing military assistance to countries such as]{.underline} Saudi
Arabia and [the Philippines there is no caveat stating it does not apply
to those involved in the drug trade]{.underline}.

#### The US directly aids in the human rights violations of the Philippines whilst providing cover under the guise of counter-terror

**Gallagher et al. 19** \[Adrian Gallagher, University of Leeds, Euan
Raffle, University of Leeds & University of Yogyakarta, Indonesia, Zain
Maulana, University of Leeds & University of Yogyakarta, "Failing to

[The US and the Philippines have a long-term relationship]{.underline}
which was formalised through the Mutual Defence Treaty of 1951. This
outlines a mutual commitment between the two nations in order to
strengthen 'efforts for collective defense for the preservation of peace
and security pending the development of a more comprehensive system of
regional security in the Pacific Area' (Yale Law school, 1951). However,
this relationship became strained following the election of Duterte
(Albert, 2016). Under President Obama, [the US was heavily critical and
suspended the sale of 26,000 assault rifles because of human rights
concerns]{.underline} (Asian Correspondent, 2016). This notably changed
in 2017. President [Trump has attempted to forge links personally with
Duterte]{.underline} (Sanger & Haberman, 2017). A leaked transcript of a
presidential phone call with Duterte showed Trump praising the
'unbelievable job on the drug problem' (Sanger & Haberman, 2017).
Furthermore, in June 2017, [the US began to provide military assistance
to the government of the Philippines in its fight against Islamic
State]{.underline} in Marawi (Villamor, 2017). The assistance raised
concerns over the Trump administration's position on the war on drugs.
This came to the fore as the US Secretary of State at the time, Rex
Tillerson, visited the Philippines to hold a meeting with Duterte in
August of that year. [Tillerson claimed, 'I see no conflict, no conflict
at all in our helping them with that situation and our views of other
human rights concerns we have with respect to how 12 A. GALLAGHER ET.
AL. they carry out their counternarcotics activities]{.underline}'
(Lima, 2017). [The statement reflects an attempt to treat the war on
drugs and the counter-terror campaign as two separate issues **whilst
implying that the anti-drug campaign is 'their' (the Philippines) issue
which in turn has little to do with the US**]{.underline}. Indeed, on
President Trump's subsequent visit to meet Duterte, the US Press
Secretary claimed that human rights was discussed 'briefly' yet Duterte
'denied the issue was broached at all' (Kurlantzick, 2017). The aim here
is not to downplay the threat posed by non-state armed groups in the
country. As the Asia-Pacific Centre's study on the Philippines explains,
there are a 'number of risk factors' including 'Moro rebel groups,
ISIS-affiliated militants, and political clans' as well as the
Government's war on drugs (Asia-Pacific Risk Assessment Series, p. 1).
Accordingly, the Philippines is a complex case in that non-state armed
groups are perpetrating mass violence in certain parts of the country
whilst the government is directing a policy of extrajudicial killings in
other areas. If the international community responded 'selectively' as
opposed to 'conditionally' 5 , and refused all international assistance
then this could leave the government without the capacity to protect its
citizens from the threat posed by nonstate armed groups. We discuss this
within the broader context of multiple priorities below, but within the
specific context of the US, **[the problem is that there is no evidence
that the US is trying to change Duterte's policy toward the war on
drugs]{.underline}**. Consequently, **[the case study gives weight to
the long-standing criticism that political elites continue to prioritise
counterterrorism over human protection norms such as the RtoP
(]{.underline}**Reinold, 2013). [There is also an incoherence in the US
approach as the public concerns over human rights violations are
undermined by President Trump's private support for
Duterte.]{.underline} Moreover, Trump has publically advocated the death
penalty for drug users within the United States which has subsequently
been used by Duterte to justify his war on drugs (Beech 2018). As a
result, **[the US approach is directly and indirectly helping to
legitimise a government that is perpetrating mass human rights
violations]{.underline}**

### Drug War IL

#### Duterte's war on drugs- with US supplied weapons- violates international law

EG.

The War on Drugs and Its Consequences for Politics and Governance
Duterte's principal priority has been a **[highly punitive approach to
illegal drug use]{.underline}**, which he sees as an existential threat
to the country's social fabric. His nationwide war on drugs has applied
the approach that he used in Davao City, [giving the police free rein to
deal with suspected drug users and pushers with little concern for legal
niceties.]{.underline} It also has involved a lesser-noticed campaign
against government officials allegedly complicit in the drug trade.
**[This approach has resulted in the deaths of thousands of suspected
drug users and pushers]{.underline}**---[mostly young males living in
poor urban neighborhoods---at the hands of the police or unidentified
assailants.]{.underline} The police claim that many of these deaths
[were the result of the suspects resisting arrest]{.underline}, but
evidence from journalists and human rights groups shows that **[many
were premeditated extra-judicial killin]{.underline}**gs (EJKs).15 The
number of EJKs is difficult to determine and disputed---in part because
the government and Philippine National Police (PNP) intentionally
obfuscate the data---but **[estimates range from 6,000 to 12,000
deaths.16 This loss of life is the most horrific and immediate
consequence of the drug]{.underline}** **[war. But the drug war itself
is a sign that the Philippine government has abdicated its
responsibility to protect human rights and respect the rule of
law.]{.underline}** EJKs violate both [the Philippine Constitution and
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (to which the
Philippines is a signatory), particularly the provisions concerning the
presumption of innocence and adherence to due process.]{.underline}
Given the attention that human rights organizations and the media have
paid to the drug war, it is worth looking more closely at the reasons
for it and some of its broader consequences.17 Why is Duterte singularly
focused on drugs and crime[? It is not surprising that crime is a major
problem in the Philippines, given its high level of poverty,
underresourced and corruption-prone law enforcement agencies, and
glacially slow judiciary]{.underline}. Criminal activities, in the form
of smuggling, illegal gambling, drugs, trafficking in persons, and money
laundering, are significant features of the Philippine political
economy.18 Studies by International Alert suggest that the illicit
economy in Mindanao plays an important role in sustaining the multiple
conflicts across the island.19 Crime has been a political issue
intermittently since the 1960s. Marcos **[pointed to criminality and
lawlessness as a justification for martial law in 1972,]{.underline}**
and Joseph Estrada's image as a crime fighter was an important aspect of
his political appeal in the late 1990s.20 [Crime also corrupts politics
and undermines institutions]{.underline}. Politicians and the police
have long participated in, protected, or otherwise benefited from
criminal activity. [The proceeds from these illegal activities have been
an important source of financing for some politicians as well as for
terrorist groups.]{.underline} At the community level, drug use and
drug-related crimes have long been recognized as serious social
problems. By the late 1990s, the importation (primarily from China),
local production, and use of methamphetamine hydrochloride (known as
shabu in the Philippines) was a major issue for law enforcement and the
courts.21 In public opinion surveys prior to 2016, crime usually came
just behind unemployment and food prices in the list of people's main
concerns. Survey data also showed a complex trend during the Aquino
administration: fewer people were victims of crime, but more were
worried about encountering drug addicts. Under Duterte, the official
estimates of drug use have increased significantly---suggesting that
they were either understated before or are being overstated now.22

#### Duterte targets the urban poor to gain power- creating an "other" who does not deserve life

EG.

Why has Duterte made illegal drugs his signature issue? In addition to
viewing drugs as a cancer on society, [there is an ugly political
logic.]{.underline} Combating drugs and crime was central to his
reputation as an effective mayor of Davao City. [Moreover, public
acceptance of the Davao Death Squad, a shadowy group that specifically
targeted suspected drug dealers, petty criminals, and homeless youth,
showed the low cost and high returns of mounting an extra-legal war on
drugs and crime]{.underline}.24 As president, Duterte's nationwide war
on drugs continues to **[play well across most socioeconomic segments of
society, particularly as long as the principal victims are the urban
poor.]{.underline}** The drug war also offers a potent and useful
political narrative in which [Duterte alone possesses the moral
authority to rescue the country from the dangers posed by drug pushers
and other criminals.]{.underline} As Peter Kreuzer, a German researcher,
has observed: Duterte not only successfully established crime as the
most pressing problem, but **[also made the unconditional fight against
this threat into a hallmark of a comprehensive "we"
group.]{.underline}** Given the assumed absoluteness of the evil to be
combated, any criticism of the president has been silenced.
**[Detractors are suspected of being supporters of the criminal threat
to society, and any reference to due process can be
ignored.]{.underline}**25 This narrative of drugs as an existential
threat has been used [to justify imprisoning opposition Senator Leila de
Lima]{.underline} (a prominent critic of Duterte's drug war), [to
exercise control over local officials, and to frame the motivation of
the Islamic extremists]{.underline} who took over Marawi City26 Public
attitudes about the war on drugs. [Most Filipinos believe that Duterte's
war on alleged drug users and pushers is a draconian but necessary
response to a serious social problem.]{.underline} Survey data have
shown strong but softening support for it: in December 2016, 85 percent
of those surveyed voiced satisfaction, though by June 2018, only 78
percent were satisfied.27 At the same time, almost three out of four
Filipinos (73 percent) believe that EJKs happen, almost as many are
concerned that they might be a victim of an EJK, and a large majority
think that it is important for the police to capture suspects alive.28
Why is there such strong public support for the drug war? [One
explanation offered is that it reflects widespread disillusionment with
the Philippine justice system]{.underline}. Certainly, rich and powerful
Filipinos enjoy near-total impunity while many poor and middle-class
Filipinos see the system's high costs, delays, partiality, and
corruption. **[However, the degree of alienation should not be
overstated:]{.underline}** few Filipinos ever go to court, and surveys
indicate that the judiciary and the police both enjoy moderately high
approval ratings. **[A second explanation is that Duterte has
successfully dehumanized suspected drug pushers and users and turned
them into a threatening "other" to be eradicated by any means
available]{.underline}**. **[As such, they do not deserve legal
protections, rehabilitation, or empathy. This view might erode if the
war on drugs expanded to target alleged drug users in the middle and
upper classes]{.underline}**.

### Authoritarianism

#### The Philippine police force fuels authoritarianism through planting evidence, and killing without due process.

Early in the morning of March 30, [Philippine security forces set out to
execute dozens of search warrants]{.underline} in the remote towns of
Canlaon, Manjuyod, and Santa Catalina on the country's southern Negros
Island. Within hours, **[the operation had left 14 farmers
dead]{.underline}**. The Philippine National Police says the "Negros
14," as they are now known, [were communist rebels killed after refusing
arrest and firing at police officers]{.underline}. Filipino and
[international rights groups refute this claim]{.underline}. A
fact-finding report by a Philippines rights coalition, based on witness
interviews, says that **[police forced family members to stand outside
of their homes before entering and killing their targets, planting
firearms as they departed in order to claim they faced armed
foes.]{.underline}** The chilling report conjures images of the
Philippine drug war, known as Oplan Tokhang---"tokhang" translates to
"knock and plead." [Drug war tactics]{.underline}, which the country's
human rights commission says [could be responsible for as many as
[27,000](https://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/12/05/18/chr-chief-drug-war-deaths-could-be-as-high-as-27000)
extrajudicial killings]{.underline}, have become the foundation of
President Rodrigo Duterte's developing counterinsurgency strategy---and
rights groups allege its range of targets is growing to include an
expanding list of those whom Duterte and his allies consider their
enemies. "There's this morphing, this fusing of tactics that is very
scary," said Carlos Conde, an Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
"This is just the beginning. I think this is the logical morphing of the
drug war." Duterte, who insists a supposed communist plot called "Red
October" [threatens his
presidency](https://www.rappler.com/news/218901-red-october-ouster-plot-vs-duterte-yearend-2018),
recently [threatened to
suspend](https://www.rappler.com/nation/227441-duterte-threatens-writ-habeas-corpus-suspension-declare-revolutionary-war)
the writ of habeas corpus for his critics and unveiled an opposition
"matrix" containing [supposed
links](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/05/13/1917515/duterte-vouches-conspiracy-matrix-hints-wiretaps)
between political opponents, journalists, activists, and communist
leaders. [Security forces]{.underline}, said Conde, [are]{.underline}
"[no longer making any distinction as to who to target as long as the
directive is clear. So they can use the methods of the drug war \[to\]
go after these people."]{.underline} Officially, the Negros Island
operation targeted communist insurgents---harking back to the
[origins](https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/07/10/dutertes-death-squads-were-born-in-americas-cold-war/)
of death squads in the Philippines during the Cold War. Days after the
killings, the regional police chief Debold Sinas
[said](https://www.philstar.com/the-freeman/cebu-news/2019/03/31/1906104/negros-oriental-14-rebels-dead)
the deceased "really fought. ... They were not ready to surrender,
because they were hardcore rebels." Eyewitnesses directly dispute this,
according to the fact-finding report. Franklin Lariosa, a farmer living
near Santa Catalina, was allegedly shot three times by policemen as he
sat on a bench next to his 4-year-old son. Police then ordered everyone
in the house to leave before announcing they had found two .38 revolvers
under a pile of dirty laundry, the report says. In Manjuyod, 20 masked
men allegedly entered the home of Valentin Acabal, a de facto village
leader, and dragged his wife and three children into the kitchen, where
they heard the words "Just do it already!" come from upstairs, followed
by three gunshots. Two hours later, police claimed they found a gun
while searching the home; Acabal's family discovered after the search
that 37,000 pesos (about \$710) were missing. [The presidential palace
has maintained these operations were "legitimate" and
[dismissed](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/04/06/1907810/palace-urges-public-not-believe-leftist-propaganda-negros-14)
reports contradicting its account as "leftist propaganda."]{.underline}
But the world is skeptical. On June 7, a group of United Nations human
rights experts [called for a
probe](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-rights-un/u-n-experts-seek-inquiry-into-unlawful-killings-in-philippines-idUSKCN1T80N3?feedType=RSS&feedName=worldNews)
into what it called a ["staggering number of unlawful deaths and police
killings in the context of the so-called war on drugs, as well as
killings of human rights defenders."]{.underline} Philippines rights
groups said they welcome a U.N. probe, while the presidential palace
[rejected
it](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/06/08/1924735/intellectually-challenged-palace-slams-un-experts-call-probe-staggering-philippines-killings)
as "intellectually challenged" and an "outrageous interference" in the
country's sovereignty. When I visited Negros shortly after the March 30
killings, I encountered an island shaken by fear and distrust, blanketed
by a sense that recent attacks bode for a darker future. The Negros
killings, and a previous state-run operation in December 2018 in which
[six farmers](https://www.apnews.com/c9a4e0708b2e44e5addcf40dd1de6c0c)
were killed, were carried out as part of Oplan Sauron. Named for the
Lord of the Rings villain, Oplan Sauron is part of a recently mandated
increase in militarization and counterinsurgency operations on the
island that share disturbing characteristics with the drug war:
**[killing without due process, planting of evidence, and a growing
climate of apparent impunity.]{.underline}** Negros is the hub of the
country's sugar production and a longtime hotspot for labor activism.
The island is split longitudinally into two provinces, both governed
politically and socially by the island's sugar haciendas, or
plantations. Farmers on the haciendas regularly make between 50 and 70
pesos (96 cents to \$1.35) per day, according to Rolando Rillo, the
chairperson of the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW). The NFSW
is an institution on the island. Established in 1979, it now has around
11,000 members in Negros. Its history of agitating for land reform, and
against the labor practices of powerful plantation owners, makes it a
thorn in the side of Philippine authorities, who have
[accused](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/23/1862505/sugar-workers-group-hits-pnp-npa-legal-front-tag)
it of being a "legal front" for the New People's Army (NPA), a communist
guerrilla outfit. Since its founding in 1969, the NPA has served as the
armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines. Both were
[declared terrorist
organizations](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/950017/duterte-declares-cpp-npa-as-terrorist-organizations)
by Duterte in 2017, following the deterioration of peace talks between
government and communist leaders. The NPA, which has historically
adopted Mao Zedong's strategy of consolidating power in rural areas,
maintains strongholds in agrarian and mountain areas throughout the
Philippines, where it has an estimated 3,700 members---paling in
comparison to the increasingly expansive membership numbers given by the
government. In October 2018, nine NFSW members on a hacienda in Sagay, a
town in Negros, were killed by unknown assailants. Authorities initially
filed charges against nine suspects, including two NFSW recruiters; the
NFSW and rights groups suspect plantation owners were behind the
massacre. Weeks later, an attorney for the slain farmers, Benjamin
Ramos, was [shot
dead](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/07/18/slain-negros-farmers-lawyer-shot-dead)
by unidentified gunmen on motorcycles. [The killings presented more
examples of how Philippine national policy bleeds into local struggles
over land and power.]{.underline} State development initiatives have
long opened the door for farmers, indigenous and Moro groups, and other
marginalized communities to be forced from their land by eager
investors, often protected by military units
[dubbed](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/regions/89872/arroyo-orders-military-to-guard-mindanao-mining-areas/story/)
by one former president as the "investment defense force." These
conflicts have existed under every administration, but Duterte's
inflammatory rhetoric and hard-line counterinsurgency policies are
motivating local power brokers to solve their disputes with violence.
The farmers killed in Sagay were engaged in bungkalan, a regular
practice of tilling a small section of land to grow their own crops
during dry seasons. The NFSW endorses bungkalan as a response to the
failures of the government's ambitious yet ineffectual land reform
program, established in 1988 to gradually disassemble the hacienda
system, a holdover from Spanish colonialism, and return arable land to
independent farmers. "Bungkalan is an expression of land reform," said
NFSW Secretary-General Butch Lozande, who noted it has been practiced
regularly since the 1970s. But Carlito Galvez, the chief of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines,
[said](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/29/1864216/closer-look-bungkalan-supposedly-sinister-plot)
days after the Sagay massacre that bungkalan was a "sinister plot"
hatched by the "international community" to take down the Duterte
administration. **[Duterte himself
[said](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/29/1864201/state-forces-arrest-shoot-groups-occupying-land-duterte-warns?fbclid=IwAR1FICKeEQspegTf6nh085GGTnPFhGa5SNn6Nwb_uUI_tft9n3gUokAmuMY)]{.underline}**
of farmers occupying idle lands: "**[Shoot them. If they resist
violently, shoot them. If they die, I do not care."]{.underline}** The
president then issued an [executive
order](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2018/11nov/20181122-MO-32-RRD.pdf)
in November that called for more police and soldiers to be deployed to
Negros Island, along with the province of Samar and region of Bicol, to
"suppress lawless violence and acts of terror," under the auspices of
the "state of national emergency" Duterte
[declared](http://time.com/4479616/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-obama-davao-blast/)
in September 2016. It's this framework that spawned Oplan Sauron, which
has left 20 farmers dead in two separate police and military operations,
and it leaves rights activists worried this is a test case for the
entire archipelago as Duterte aims to consolidate his power. "It's a
mini-martial law," said Gi Estrada, the media officer for UMA Pilipinas,
an agricultural workers' organization. "Negros is an experiment, a
laboratory for the rest of the country." Negros residents harbor
memories of the horrors of martial law under the dictator Ferdinand
Marcos from the 1960s to the 1980s, and the island experienced unrest in
the 1980s as the global price of sugar plunged, leaving farmers
destitute. In September 1985, 20 protesters were killed by paramilitary
forces in Escalante, a town just east of Sagay. Promised land reforms
never materialized---but violence has returned. In April, about 500
residents of Escalante protested Oplan Sauron and the militarization of
the region, calling for justice for the slain farmers and marching to
the local Department of Agrarian Reform. Less than two weeks later,
Bernardino "Toto" Patigas, a city councilor and longtime advocate for
the region's sugar farmers, was
[killed](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1110151/makabayan-bloc-asks-house-to-probe-killing-of-escalante-city-councilor)
by unidentified gunmen in the town center. Negros resident Arje
Marangga, who works as a secretary for the NFSW near Escalante, attended
the April protest despite her own fears. She told me that on one March
morning she was at home with her parents and her five children when
infantry soldiers knocked on the door at 4 a.m., ordered everyone
outside, and began searching the house for an unknown woman. Once they
failed to find the woman, she said, they said Marangga herself was under
arrest. "I gave them my birth certificate to prove it wasn't me," she
said. The soldiers eventually left, but their continued searching of the
area made the family feel unsafe; her mother and four children have fled
to Cebu, and the rest have not returned home since the incident. "I fear
for my life," she said. The Duterte administration has yet to provide
clear evidence of the alleged links between communist rebels and the
NFSW, along with other rights groups. Some areas of Negros are NPA
strongholds; local media regularly report on clashes between NPA rebels
and state security forces, and NPA recruiters often try to draw
disaffected sugar workers into their ranks. "When they have nowhere to
go, under those difficult circumstances, they will certainly go to the
rebels," Lozande, the NFSW secretary-general, said. The **[new strategy
of extrajudicial killings, however, leaves no day in court for victims,
rebels or otherwise. No distinction is made between the NPA and the
rights groups, journalists, and labor leaders labeled as communists by
the Duterte administration.]{.underline}** Clarizza Singson, the
chairperson of the Negros chapter of the human rights group Karapatan,
showed me her photo on a poster hung in public last year urging citizens
to report her and other supposed communists to the police. Singson, a
noted human rights defender who regularly speaks to audiences abroad,
said she receives regular death threats at home for her advocacy on
behalf of the island's sugar workers. In April, Karapatan and other
rights groups [filed letters of
allegation](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/04/05/1907546/karapatan-raises-red-tagging-concerns-un-officials)
to the United Nations after the government named several legal
nongovernmental organizations as communist fronts and asked the European
Union to stop funding the groups. The Philippines military has said some
funding has been [placed on
hold](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/03/13/1901175/eu-funding-philippine-ngos-put-hold-over-alleged-communist-ties).
The EU has said it will [probe the
allegations](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/04/05/1907546/karapatan-raises-red-tagging-concerns-un-officials)
after earlier asking the Duterte administration to provide evidence of
its claims. Authorities, however, have
[challenged](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/05/03/1914566/albayalde-kmu-prove-youre-not-communist-front)
rights groups to prove they are not affiliated with communists. Conde,
of Human Rights Watch, said central directives serve as a mandate for
authorities in provinces such as Negros. "What the drug war methods have
done is they not only embolden the authorities, they embolden as well
the local leaders who now see the Tokhang \[drug war\]-type campaign as
something they need to support," he said. "This is going to create a lot
of Duterte clones." As the lines continue to blur, the Duterte opponents
caught in his matrix fear the drug war's campaign of extrajudicial
killings will target them next. The new Philippine counterinsurgency is
"Tokhang with search warrants," said Estrada of UMA, the agricultural
workers' organization. "They plant evidence. We plant crops."

### US Complicit

#### The US is complicit in aiding Duterte's genocidal acts

**Simangan 17** \[Dahlia Simangan, Center for Policy Research, United
Nations University, Tokyo, Japan, "Is the Philippine "War on Drugs" an
Act of Genocide?" Taylor & Francis 7-17-2017
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14623528.2017.1379939\] //AT

This article has analysed Duterte's "war on drugs" by scoping existing
news articles, government briefings, public speeches and available
drug-related statistics. [Duterte's "war on drugs" is a textbook case of
what the processes of genocide look like]{.underline}. Drug suspects in
the Philippines are classified as "bad" and labelled as criminals
through symbolisms. **[Duterte, his administration and his supporters
believe that drug suspects are not human, or less human than
them.]{.underline}** As it is a state-sanctioned policy, the "war on
drugs" is highly organized with both state and non-state actors
participating in anti-drug operations. This drug war is also polarizing,
with one side of the debate wanting to get rid of drug suspects by
whatever means possible and the other side wanting to protect their
human rights. [Duterte's administration has created enforcement
programmes, mobilized police and military apparatuses, and silenced or
threatened political critics in order to efficiently exterminate drug
suspects]{.underline}. He has also encouraged civilians to participate
not just in reporting drug suspects but also in shooting them. Duterte
is happy to slaughter millions of drug suspects, likening himself to
Hitler. He has ordered "shoot-to-kill" operations and assured officers
involved in these operations of his support and protection. [Duterte
justifies his policies using a rhetoric of fear, hatred and paranoia in
order to deny accountability for the deaths from his "war on
drugs."]{.underline} Police officers in anti-drug operations eliminate
evidence that drug suspects were unarmed and compliant. Due to this
state-sponsored violence, witnesses and family members are intimidated
out of speaking for the victims. [Duterte and his administration
continue to block independent investigations and threaten critics of his
policies while putting into positions of power people]{.underline}
Duterte feels indebted to despite their lack of qualifications and
experience. Considering all these factors, **[Duterte's "war on drugs"
satisfies the stages of genocide]{.underline}** as Stanton describes
them. It may not fully satisfy the legal definition of genocide but it
has the characteristics found in stages of classification,
symbolization, dehumanization, organization, polarization, preparation,
extermination and denial. This approach departs from limiting genocide
to its legalistic definition and considers a more contextual analysis of
what constitutes an act of genocide. The analysis in this article also
reveals that [stages of genocide can be overlapping, interconnected and
non-linear.]{.underline} First, in Duterte's "war on drugs,"
symbolization happens simultaneously with extermination when drug
suspects are killed and labelled with cardboard signs. Second, the
dehumanization stage traverses other stages. Drug suspects are
dehumanized in the classification, symbolization and extermination
stages. Third, these stages can also be non-linear. After the deaths of
drug suspects, Duterte and his administration propagate rhetoric that
polarizes the public in their opinions of human rights, crime and public
policy on drugs. Inquiring whether the Philippine "war on drugs" is an
act of genocide produces two opposing but not mutually exclusive
answers. The answer is no if the inquiry is kept within the confines of
the legalistic definition of genocide. The answer is yes based on
Stanton's stages of genocide and other broader definitions of genocide.
Applying Stanton's stages of genocide is an alternative approach to
explaining genocidal events that may not fall under the traditional or
conventional conceptualization of genocide. The problem with this
approach, as Moses warns, is that "it may identify situations as at
least 'pre-genocidal' that it does not intend to highlight." 148
However, in the case of the Philippine "war on drugs," [the stages of
genocide have already all been fulfilled.]{.underline} Some may also
argue that Duterte may be responsible for crimes against humanity but
not genocide. While this may be true, how does one reconcile the fact
that the Philippine "war on drugs" fulfils all the stages of genocide?
Perhaps it is at this point that i[t is more rational to depart from
definitionalism and instead focus on what must be done to avert this
humanitarian crisis]{.underline}, whatever name one prefers to give it.
As Stanton laments, "debating whether mass killing fits the conventional
definition of genocide is most often an excuse for non-action." 149 Even
if one does not accept that the Philippine "war on drugs" is an act of
genocide, using Stanton's stages adds to existing discussions and
measures on genocide prevention. It sheds light on events related to and
hopes to set an alarm for the state-sponsored humanitarian crisis in the
Philippines. It is also a particularly useful analytical lens for
explaining how perpetrators of genocide operate and a confirmation that
genocide is a process,150 a progression of events, and a series of
planned methods operated by organized actors and agencies. **[Calling
the mass murder of drug suspects in the Philippines a "war on drugs"
removes its human toll]{.underline}**. It must be called what it is---a
mass murder of unarmed, often poor civilians suspected of using drugs.
At his command, Duterte's administration has successfully incited, if
not wholly organized, the killings of more than 7,000 Filipinos out of
fear and a hatred of heinous crimes previously committed by either
suspected or proven drug users. They have justified the killing of drug
suspects by claiming that if they were not killed, they would kill. It
is murdering the "murderer" before the murder happens.

#### US support is key to propping up Duterte's regime and his war on drugs. 

- \$193.5 in military aid

- US helped start the war on drugs in the Philippines

- Displacement of 450,000 civilians

- Atrocities against indigenous communities

- Weapons used against dissenters and human rights defenders

#### US supported policies of Duterte's regime create human rights abuses and cause a chilling effect.

stowPCB

This collection of cases illustrates a [new wave of killings and human
rights abuses in the Philippines that is more expansive and insidious
than ever]{.underline}. The Filipino [people]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} once again [confronted]{.underline} [with]{.underline}
[state]{.underline} [terror]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
[perils]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [fascist]{.underline} policies
[under]{.underline} the Rodrigo [Duterte]{.underline} presidency.
Reports and data that [human rights]{.underline} group Karapatan and
other [organizations]{.underline} [manage]{.underline} [to monitor do
not come close to the magnitude of individuals, groups and communities
victimized by the United States-backed Duterte regime and its police and
armed forces]{.underline}. Duterte's **[fascist policies are
increasing]{.underline}** -- from the counterinsurgency program Oplan
Kapayapaan, the merciless drug war campaign, the martial law in Mindanao
and the threat of expanding martial rule to the whole country, to
current moves toward authoritarian rule through charter change
ostensibly to shift to a federal system of government. The Duterte
government has also failed to disclose that [the US has launched in
September 2017 a new "counter-terror" operation called Pacific
Eagle-Philippines, which enables permanent US military presence that not
only violates the Philippine constitution, but also poses risk to
communities]{.underline}. This is in addition to onerous RP-US Visiting
Forces Agreement (VFA), which has [allowed]{.underline} rotational,
[permanent]{.underline} [presence]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
undisclosed [US troops]{.underline} in the country following its
ratification by the Philippine Senate in 1999. In the wake of these
policies are **[growing numbers of killings]{.underline}**, **[attacks
on communities, illegal arrests, harassments and other violation of
people's rights]{.underline}** especially with Duterte's cancellation of
the peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines
(NDFP). With Oplan Tokhang resulting in thousands of alleged drug users
or peddlers gunned down based on mere suspicion and police claims of
"nanlaban" (fought back), rights groups and people's organizations are
alarmed by [Duterte's order]{.underline} to shoot and kill suspected
armed rebels as this [gives state forces the license to kill unarmed
civilians]{.underline} expediently tagged as rebels. Furthermore, the
threat to crack down on activists and critics has a **[chilling
effect]{.underline}** on the public and the people's exercise of their
rights and liberties. Once again, Filipinos are faced by the truth that
rights are not granted by states, but must be always asserted and
defended. Clearly, the people must stand firm, raise their voices, and
collectively act against oppression and tyranny. **[The Duterte
government should be held accountable]{.underline}** for attacks against
the Filipino people, including thousands of victims of extrajudicial
killings perpetrated under the administration's campaign against illegal
drugs. As with the previous book series of IBON Foundation on State
Terror that disseminated information on the Arroyo government's crimes
against the Filipino people, this book aims to contribute in exposing
the Duterte regime's fascist and neoliberal economic policies and the
deteriorating human rights situation in the Philippines. Published by
the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines and IBON
International, it hopes to stir international concern and solidarity and
galvanize greater action to resist continuing state violence and
tyranny.

### US Aid Bad

#### US aid worsens the humanitarian crisis in the Philippines.

Ever since the Philippines attained formal independence in 1946, the
U.S. has [maintained a military presence on its former colony, guiding
and supporting "counter-insurgency]{.underline}" operations to put down
constant rebellions against an oligarchic government. Today, the
[**Philippine armed forces** overwhelmingly direct violence not against
outside invaders, **but at poor and marginalized people within its
borders. U.S. military aid is only making internal conflict
worse**]{.underline}. **[U.S. taxpayer funds are bankrolling the
worsening human rights crisis in the Philippines.]{.underline}**
Duterte's repressive regime is
the [largest](http://philippineslifestyle.com/military-aid-usa-philippines/) [recipient](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/09/10/1850124/philippines-largest-recipient-us-military-aid) of
U.S.
military [aid](https://explorer.usaid.gov/agencies/?agency=7&year=2017&measure=Obligations)
in East and SoutheastAsia. In 2016, the U.S. helped inaugurate Duterte's
drug war by giving [[\$32
million](http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/07/27/1607298/us-pledges-32m-philippine-law-enforcement)
to the Philippine police]{.underline} (supposedly for "[training and
services](http://www.rappler.com/nation/147196-us-funding-philippines-law-enforcement)"
in "policing standards" and "rule of law," besides
[equipment](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/lig-oco-opep-0918.pdf)).
In July 2018, the [United States announced an additional [\$26.5
million](https://ph.usembassy.gov/united-states-to-boost-counterterrorism-support-for-philippine-law-enforcement/)
in U.S. tax dollars to beef up support for Philippine police, in the
name of "counter-terrorism."]{.underline} In FY2018, the Defense
Department provided [[roughly \$100
million](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf)
in military aid,]{.underline} including equipment, weapons, and aerial
surveillance systems, to the Philippine military and police, though
Operation Pacific Eagle --- **[a so-called "overseas contingency
operation" that is [exempt](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44519.pdf)
from congressional limits on spending.]{.underline}** The amount
demanded for this program will increase to [\$108.2
million](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf)
for FY2019 --- even as the Defense Department has
[admitted](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf)
it lost track of transactions for 76 of 77 arms sales conducted under
bilateral agreements with the Philippines.

#### There are no restrictions on aid and a lack of transparency

Mellon-ACLS Public Fellow. "It's Time to End U.S. Military Aid to the
Philippines" Foreign Policy in Focus. April 8, 2019.

In 2018, on top of the above, the U.S. sold the Philippine
[police](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf)
and
[military](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/lig-oco-opep-0918.pdf)
over \$63 million worth of arms. It also donated [2,253 machine
guns](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf),
over [5
million](https://ph.usembassy.gov/us-government-provides-millions-of-rounds-of-ammunition-to-the-armed-forces-of-the-philippines/)
rounds of ammunition, surveillance equipment, and other weapons.
Military aid totaled at least \$193.5 million last year, not including
arms sales, and donated equipment of unreported worth. At least \$145.6
million is already pledged for 2019. In January, Trump authorized \$1.5
billion annually for the Asian Pacific region, including the
Philippines, from 2019 to 2023. Although this authorization includes a
[stipulation](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2736/text)
that counter-narcotics funds will not go to the Philippines ("except for
drug demand reduction," a potential loophole), it's too little, too
late**[. The set-aside has no restrictions on weapons funding for the
Philippine military]{.underline}**. And separately, the State Department
already plans to deliver [\$5.3
million](https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/290302.pdf) this
year to the Philippine police for anti-narcotics activities. **[Worse,
rampant corruption together with a total lack of transparency means it's
hard to ensure where military aid could actually end up.]{.underline}**
U.S. military equipment forms the backbone of Duterte's "military
modernization" program. Although the above aid is tiny compared to the
**[U.S.'s own bloated military budget, this tremendous transfer of
weapons and surveillance technology is significant in propping up the
Philippine armed forces' capacity.]{.underline}** Duterte has embarked
on an ambitious program to "modernize" the Philippine military,
[massively increasing funding and pouring more money towards this than
spent in [the last 15
years](https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2018/10/21/1861787/afp-budget-biggest-ever?fbclid=IwAR0KDcJItqxS3Cr1OstUNZRG-SXtaCzJ75rlLaRy0HQ1-pIAM7S46fYFiEQ).]{.underline}
(Meanwhile, he's
[doubled](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/01/09/18/cops-soldiers-other-uniformed-personnel-to-begin-receiving-doubled-pay)
the salaries of military and police.) **[He could not do so without U.S.
aid and arms.]{.underline}**or its part, the U.S. is particularly
interested in
[expanding](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf)
aerial "intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance" missions over
Mindanao, the largest island in the Southern Philippines, rich in
untapped mineral resources. **[Without U.S. aid, the Philippine military
would lack the airplanes and technology to perform this
surveillance.]{.underline}**What's more, this year's Operation Pacific
Eagle budget sets aside an extra [\$3.5
million](https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2019-02/OPEP_Q119_Dec2018_final.pdf)
for U.S. military efforts to collect and analyze "local media in native
languages" --- underscoring that the U.S. is striving for an upper hand
in directing Philippine military operations. And in winning an
information war over public opinion.

Philippines]{.underline}, St. Martin's Press, p. 174-176)n

The first chapter in this book identified the [Philippines as a country
in crisis, political crisis, a country being **cramped into a right wing
perspective by the economic and military jaws of US aspirations for
world control,** and therefore]{.underline} world
[domination]{.underline}. In this global game, [the **Americans laugh
behind the backs of Filipinos** as they use and abuse them - providing
cheap labour to bring in huge profits for multinational
companies]{.underline}; [putting them in the front line in case of
nuclear attack;]{.underline} and having on hand an inexhaustible supply
of young Asian women to satisfy the insatiable sexual appetite of more
than 30000 service personnel who exploit and demean the inhabitants of
another sovereign country. [How does the \'moral majority\' in the US
square its conscience as 10 000 of its population go ashore each night
at Subic Bay]{.underline} - and others tumble out of the other bases -
**[to ravage the local population - women, men and even
children?]{.underline}** Conveniently, as it does in Western Europe,
[the US puts another country - in this case the Philippines - in the
\'hot seat\' for the first strike in the event of nuclear
war]{.underline}, perhaps [just hoping that one or two bombs \'would
bring the world to its senses\' and leave the US and its citizens
unscathed and unharmed. The **very presence of the US in the Philippines
increases the likelihood of nuclear war** with every day that
passes.]{.underline} In line with Emmanuel\'s analysis, reports in
Philippine Agenda show, for instance, that if a one-megaton bomb were
dropped on the JUSMAG offices in Quezon City - where extensive security
building works took place in 1987 - everything would be annihilated
within several miles. In an instant, 9000 people would be dead and most
buildings turned to rubble. Quezon City and San Juan residents would be
the most affected. Several seconds later, 1.25 million more would die
and hundreds of thousands of others would be severely injured in
surrounding municipalities (Sampaloc, Pandacan, San Miguel, Quiapo,
Santa Cruz, San Juan, dei Monte and parts of Paco, Santa Ana, Tondo,
Caloocan and Mandaluyong). Eighteen seconds after that, 750000 would die
in Makati, Ermita, Malate, Santa Ana, Paco, Intramuros, South Port, San
Nicolas, Binondo, Tondo, Navotas, Malabon, Marikina, Pasig and portions
of Valenzuela and Pasay. Forty seconds later, another 170000 people
would be dead in Paranaque, Pasay, Pateros, Taquig, Taytay, Cainta,
Antipolo, San Mateo, Obando, Meycauayan, and the rest of Malabon,
Novotas and Valenzuela. In less than aminute, over two million people
would have died and more would have been severelyinjured. Iffourofthe US
main facilities in the Philippines, namely, Clark Air Base, Subic Naval
Station, San Miguel Communications Station and JUSMAG , were attacked
simultaneously, [one-tenth of the country\'s population -six million
Filipinos would die from the blasts, from burns, from radiation
sickness, and later from cancer. Many more would be severely hurt. Five,
10, 15 or 20 million Filipinos could perish as a result of thisor any
other reason - and **for many Americans this would only be yet another
item on a news broadcast.**]{.underline} [There is no respect for huinan
dignity; women\'s bodies are something that Americans in the Philippines
seem to think they have a right to buy or degrade as they see fit; and
the **exploitation, pollution and rape of the land bec;ome an
entitlement because of wealth and power.** If]{.underline} ever new
technology, [a]{.underline} new world order or the [opportunity for a
more desirable location for the siting of the bases could be found,
**the US would \'ditch\' the Philippines overnight.**]{.underline}
**[What does the word \'ally\' mean to the US?]{.underline}** When [more
than 3000 people drowned in the Philippines in the worst sea tragedy
known to man]{.underline} - on 20 December 1987 - [what relief did the
US send to families of the bereaved? **Nothing**]{.underline}. How
concerned was the US when such a sea disaster affected the lives of tens
of thousands of Filipinos? [What happened to the \'special
relationship\' so frequently referred to when antiAmerican feeling is
particularly apparent?]{.underline} Clearly, **[the most important thing
for the US to do is to pack up and leave.]{.underline}** [For 90 years,
they have used the Philippines as a staging post for aggressive acts
within the region, they have brutalised the people and warped and
twisted the culture. They have reached the point where, unless they
withdraw, they will be forced into \'bloody\' local
encounters]{.underline} - both fighting alongside the AFP and being on
the receiving end of acts of sabotage against their installations or
being the victims of individual attacks. The assassination of three
Americans on 28 October 1987 should serve as a warning. Many others are
targeted, given the \'right\' set of circumstances. This is made quite
clear in a statement issued by the NDF on 5 November 1987, and signed by
Satur Ocampo, who - with Antonio Zumel - made up the NDF panel during
the ceasefire negotiations: The National Democratic Front wams the
United States government to stop meddling in the internal affairs of the
Philippine people, or pay a high price for its military-political
intervention in terms of American lives and property. [The proponents of
\'Iow intensity conflict\' in the Pentagon, the eIA and the State
Department are mercilessly pushing to intensify the level of violence
inflicted upon our people, both in rural and urban areas, through the
\'total war\' designed, directed and assisted by the US]{.underline}.
[The objective]{.underline} of this war [is to]{.underline} stern the
advance of the revolutionary movement and to pr[eserve US economic,
military and geopolitical interests in the Philippines.]{.underline} For
a long time now, the NDF and a broad spectrum of people\'s organisations
have denounced and opposed [US intervention as a major cause of the
nation\'s problems.]{.underline}

#### Colonial violence structurally influences the conditions of Filipinos leading to acculturative inferiority

**David & Nadal 13** \[E. J. R. David, psychology professor at the
University of Alaska Anchorage, Kevin L. Nadal professor at the John Jay
College of Criminal Justice - City University of New York, "The Colonial
Context of Filipino American Immigrants\' Psychological Experiences,"
*Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology*, 2013,
10.1037/a0032903\] // AT

The results of the two studies combine to suggest that [Filipino
American immigrants\' psychological experiences are **influenced by
colonialism and its legacies** while they were still in the Philippines
and after they arrive in the United States]{.underline}. Using
qualitative data. Study 1 **[findings provide initial empirical support
to the notion that ethnic and cultural denigration]{.underline}**---a
form of acculturative stress---are experienced by Filipino American
immigrants in the Philippines before they emigrated. Study 1 also
revealed that it is possible for [such experiences]{.underline} to
**[lead to the development of CM among Filipinos in the
Philippines]{.underline}**, that Filipino American immigrants may bring
such a condition with them when they move to the United States, and that
CM may influence the psychological experiences and mental health of
Filipino American immigrants. Using quantitative data from a national
sample of Filipino American immigrants. Study 2 findings support the
notion that **[the denigration of the Filipino ethnicity and culture in
the Philippines is common]{.underline}**. Messages about Filipino ethnic
and cultural inferiority were received from family members, peers, and
the general community, resulting in almost everyone in tbe sample being
socialized with, or at least exposed to, CM. [Study 2 also provides
evidence that such an exposure can lead to the intemalization of ethnic
and cultural inferiority, which is the initial stage and manifestation
of CM or intemalized oppression as observed from various
groups]{.underline} (David & Okazaki, 2006b; Fanon, 1965; Freiré, 1970;
Memmi, 1965). Further, Study 2 results also provide evidence that CM
among Filipino American immigrants may be reinforced (or initiated) by
experiences of racism after arriving in the United States. [These
findings support the notion that Filipino]{.underline} American
[immigrants experienced acculturative stress]{.underline}---and thus
began their process of acculturation---[while they were still in the
Philippines, long before they immigrated to the United
States.]{.underline} 306 DAVID AND NADAL Table 2 Hierarchical Regression

= Schedule of Racist Events. Therefore, the typical immigration
paradigm---wherein the process of acculturation is assumed to begin when
immigrants arrive in the United States---does not completely capture the
Filipino American immigration experience. Study 2 results also confirmed
the possibility that CM may play a role in Filipino American
immigrants\' mental health. Consistent with previous findings regarding
immigrants\' mental health (e.g.. Gee, Spencer, Chen, & Takeuchi, 2007;
Gee, Spencer, Chen, Yip, et al., 2007; Hovey et al., 2002; Mossakowski,
2003), status variables such as income and educational level are related
to fewer symptoms of depression, suggesting that such status variables
are related to better mental health among Filipino American immigrants.
Also consistent with previous research is the finding that [experiences
of racism and]{.underline} the stress associated with such
experiences---a form of [acculturative stress]{.underline}---are related
to more depression symptoms and poorer mental health among Filipino
American immigrants. Unique to the current study, however, is the
finding that CM---[a consequential legacy of colonialism and
contemporary oppression---is an important psychological construct to
consider when conceptualizing and investigating the psychological
experiences]{.underline} and mental health of Filipino American
immigrants. Although research on various immigrant populations has
progressed significantly, the presented findings suggest that [paying
attention to colonialism and its legacies is necessary in order to more
completely understand]{.underline} Filipino American immigrants\'
[psychological experiences]{.underline} and mental health. Relatedly,
Filipinos are not the only immigrants with a history of colonialism.
Indeed, some scholars have also begun to contextualize the Latino
(Urbina & Smith, 2007), African (Adeyanju & Oriola, 2011), and other
Asian (Bhatia, 2007) immigration experiences in terms of colonialism.
Thus, the presented findings may also be helpful in broadening our
conceptualization of the immigration experiences of other historically
colonized groups, and how their colonial contexts infiuence their
psychological experiences and mental health.

### Indiegenous Violence

militarization is resulting in **[rampant abuses against indigenous and

### Solvency

#### The Philippines have been the site of American colonialism in which subconscious violence permeates through society. The aff must offer a moment of transgression from which we can expose the imperial destruction of Filipino culture.

Colonialism Under the United States. After more than 300 years of
subjugation, a series of major Filipino uprisings seriously disrupted
Spain's control over the Philippines toward the end of the 19th century
(Agoncillo, 1974; Espiritu, 2003; Pido, 1997). As a result, [Spain sold
the Philippines to the United States for \$20 million during the Treaty
of Paris in 1898**, and this began yet another long period of
colonization for the Filipinos.**]{.underline} However, despite
unimproved agricultural reformations that continued to suppress the
socioeconomic status of most Filipinos, one positive change that U.S.
colonization brought was free education. The Americans established a
nationwide public school system in which most of the educators were
"Thomasites"---American teachers who came in the country through the St.
Thomas transport (Espiritu, 2003). The St. Thomas transport was a U.S.
Army vessel that sailed from California to the Philippines in 1901
carrying more than 500 American volunteer teachers and officials. A year
later, the Thomasites' numbers grew to more than 1,000 as the United
States became more convinced that "education, instead of outright
military suppression, was the more effective means to pacify the
Filipinos" (Espiritu, 2003, p. 26). One major drawback of the
establishment of the Americanized public school system was that, in
addition to teaching the Filipino students the English language and
fundamental academics, the Thomasites were said to have been
"inculcating Pilipinos with American values" (Pido, 1997, p. 24) as well
as shaping Filipino worldview with American political ideas in the
establishment of the U.S. tutelary regime (Go, 2003). Pido argued that
the Thomasites informed Filipinos that America is the land of endless
opportunities and wealth---"the land of milk and honey" (p. 24).
[Because many Filipinos were poor and because socioeconomic mobility in
the Philippines was extremely limited at the time, **the American
educators' information about the United States may have distorted the
Filipinos' view of life in America**]{.underline} (Pido, 1997). As a
probable result, **[Filipinos may have developed a grandiose picture of
anything American and mediocre attributions toward anything
Filipino]{.underline}** (e.g., Karnow, 1989; Tompar-Tiu &
Sustento-Seneriches, 1995), similar to how Filipinos were thought to
have developed the belief that the Spanish and their ways of life were
naturally superior. A number of [scholars]{.underline} of postcolonial
Philippines (e.g., Espiritu, 2003; Go, 2003; Karnow, 1989; Root, 1997)
[have asserted that this perception of American superiority may be
passed on from one generation to the next through socialization,
continuous endorsement of the American version of the Golden
Legend]{.underline} (i.e., Colonial Mentality Among Filipino Americans 7
perceiving Americans as freedom fighters, the masters of democracy, and
enlightening heroes), **[and the persistent Americanization of the
Philippines.]{.underline}** It has been argued that the prolonged and
significant U.S. political and military involvement in the Philippines
may have continued to reinforce such a belief of American superiority as
well (Espiritu, 2003; Karnow, 1989). Current events in the Philippines
also reflect America's continued influence on the country. For example,
the Philippine president ordered the use of English as the primary
language for instruction (Departamento ng Filipino at Panitikan ng
Pilipinas, 2003), and **[U.S. soldiers continue to be active in the
Philippines to "train" Philippine troops in suppressing
terrorism.]{.underline}** Indeed, as Karnow (1989) suggests, ". . .in no
place is **[the imperial legacy more alive than in Manila, where
America's presence is almost as dynamic now as it was during the days of
U.S. rule"]{.underline}** (p.16). [For many contemporary Filipino
American immigrants and children of immigrants, **it is likely that the
psychological legacy of colonialism, or CM, continues to exist through
intergenerational socialization and through continued Americanization of
the Philippines that further cement the notion of American superiority
over the Philippine nation and culture**]{.underline} (Espiritu, 2003).
In summary, Filipinos and Filipino Americans have experienced both
classical colonialism and internal colonialism here in the United States
as well as in the Philippines (Lott, 1976). CM Discourse in the Filipino
American Community Cordova (1973), a Filipino American historian, was
one of the earliest, if not the first, to discuss the presence of CM
among Filipino Americans. Cordova asserted that the history of
colonization and its accompanying cultural replacements have contributed
to the ever-present Filipino ethnic and cultural identity crisis---
confusion as to what constitutes an authentic Filipino culture and
identity. **[Such an identity crisis is believed to lead toward the
conclusion that there is no authentic Filipino culture and identity that
one can be proud of, and thus, may lead to the perception of inferiority
toward anything Filipino.]{.underline}** Lott (1976) also discussed the
existence of such a condition among contemporary Filipino Americans,
which she attributed to the continued subjugation or oppression of this
group within the United States (internal colonialism). Furthermore, Lott
also argued that immigrant Filipinos may have brought with them such a
mentality from the Philippines. Revilla (1997) analyzed Filipino
American student essays and Filipino American community newsletters and
concluded that CM is a prevalent phenomenon within this ethnic group.
[Editorials in Filipino American community publications cite CM as
contributing to the lack of societal presence and social unity of many
Filipino American communities and lack of ethnic pride, historical
knowledge, and cultural appreciation of many Filipino American
individuals]{.underline} (e.g., Gaston, 2003).

#### The State Department should end the sale of assault rifles to the Republic of the Philippines' national police.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - [The U.S. State Department halted the planned
sale of some 26,000 assault rifles to the Philippines' national
police]{.underline} after [Senator Ben Cardin said he would oppose
it,]{.underline} Senate aides told Reuters on Monday. A member of the
Philippine National Police (PNP) stands guard while residents look on
near the scene where two suspected drug pushers were killed during a
police operation, in metro Manila, Philippines October 8, 2016.
REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco Aides said Cardin, the top Democrat on the U.S.
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was reluctant for the United States
to provide the weapons given concerns about human rights violations in
the Philippines. News of the thwarting of the weapons sale was met with
disappointment among the Philippine police and government on Tuesday,
but they said alternative suppliers would be found. Police spokesman
Dionardo Carlos said the Philippines had yet to be notified about the
sale being stopped. The relationship between the United States and the
Philippines, a long-time ally, has been complicated lately by President
Rodrigo Duterte's angry reaction to criticism from Washington of his
violent battle to rid the country of illegal drugs. More than 2,300
people have been killed in police operations or by suspected vigilantes
in connection with the anti-narcotics campaign since Duterte took office
on June 30. [The U.S. State Department informs Congress when
international weapons sales are in the works]{.underline}. Aides said
[Foreign Relations committee staff informed State that Cardin would
oppose the deal during the department's prenotification process for the
sale of 26,000-27,000 assault rifles, stopping the deal]{.underline}.

#### The United States Federal Government should condition arms sales to the Philippines on ending human rights violations -- empirically solves.

**Pangilinan 12**(Christian. JD @ Georgetown, Lecturer of Law @ Peking,

To think that the United States can do nothing and therefore might as
well do nothing is the wrong conclusion. The [Aquino administration\'s
commitment to ending military abuses is already wavering]{.underline}.
[If it is rewarded with aid despite its human rights record, what little
incentive it has to stop military abuses will be weakened even
more]{.underline}. [The Philippines does]{.underline}, however, **[have
a record of responding to U.S. pressure]{.underline}** - [as it has done
with respect to human trafficking- when this pressure comes with
consequences]{.underline}. [Aid programs,]{.underline} like those
administered by the Asia Foundation, [can take measures to stop military
abuses]{.underline}. They can help journalists, lawyers, and community
groups. What aid programs have not been able [to]{.underline} do is
[apply pressure to the top of the government hierarchy and force a
transformation in its attitudes and policy.]{.underline} The United
States should not give up on human rights in the Philippines until it
has done everything it can. Although progress has been slow, this is not
because Philippine human rights advocates, churches, and civil society
groups have not taken advantage of what help the United States and
others have provided. At every workshop and program funded by USAID that
I attended, I was told by participants how much [\"we really need
this]{.underline}.\" [Americans]{.underline} can take pride in the help
that they have given, but they [should express their disappointment with
the Philippine government\'s failure to act]{.underline}. [By telling
the Philippine government that **it must stop the killings or forfeit a
larger chunk of its aid from the United States**,]{.underline} [the
United States can force the]{.underline} Aquino [administration to
require the armed forces to]{.underline} genuinely [address human rights
violations]{.underline} by its members.

### Other Actors Solve

#### ASEAN would fill in to solve stability.

The disputes could take a very different path, however. Continued
aggression by [China]{.underline}, or continued fears about the
consequences of its rise [might unite ASEAN against their northern
neighbor]{.underline}. This contingency has some historical precedent.
Although ASEAN members have divergent interests and their own
conflicting claims in the South China Sea, China's occupation of
Philippines-claimed Mischief Reef in the Spratlys in 1994 united the
regional organization against China's aggression.61 62 [ASEAN's
collective strength, and the commitment of diplomatic]{.underline},
economic, and military support from [outside players would limit Chinese
influence]{.underline}, and continue the multipolar competition for
influence in the region. The disputes are likely to take a path between
these two poles, which could take many forms. The [players may find
enough political capital to allow international law to resolve the
conflicts, greatly reducing]{.underline} (but probably not eliminating)
[internal and external tensions in the region]{.underline}. The
claimants could also agree to bilateral or multilateral treaties that
resolve the conflicts in a mutually beneficial manner, or agree to
establish a multilateral institutional framework to govern these
commons. [This framework might include]{.underline} joint regulation of
[fishing and oil exploration efforts, provide an international law
enforcement mechanism, or allow for joint naval patrols]{.underline} of
the sea.63 This section of the paper will explore under what conditions
the disputes might follow one track over another.

MANILA, Philippines -- [A number of apparent **suicide bombings** in the

**militancy** driven by the influence of the Islamic State in Southeast
Asia]{.underline}, security experts say. A [decades-old Islamist
insurgency in the]{.underline} southern [Philippines has killed tens of
thousands. But suicide attacks have been used extremely
rarely]{.underline}, with foreign fighters blamed for the few that have
been carried out. [Authorities now fear however the most **recent
suspected suicide attack**, which struck a military base]{.underline}
Friday, [June 28]{.underline}, in Indanan town, Sulu, killing at least 8
people, [may have been]{.underline} [the work of a
[Filipino]{.underline}](https://www.rappler.com/nation/234432-philippine-military-suspects-indanan-attack-first-suicide-bombing-by-local).
It was the [third suspected suicide
attack](https://www.rappler.com/nation/234203-sulu-attack-military-camp-similar-jolo-cathedral-bombing)
since July 2018. \"[The change did not come with (Friday\'s) bombing, it
came with the introduction of a **lethal new ideology** into the
Philippines]{.underline},\" said security analyst Sidney Jones. \"[The
game-changer\" was **the Islamic State**]{.underline}, she added. [As
its \"caliphate\" crumbled in the Middle East, ISIS has stepped up its
strategy of absorbing existing insurgent groups around the world and
claiming their attacks.]{.underline} [The group has had a presence **for
years** in the south of the Philippines]{.underline}, where rugged
terrain and weak government control provide a safe haven for fighters.
[Suicide attacks indicate a **higher level of commitment** to the
militant cause]{.underline}, experts say, and are often approved by the
central leadership of ISIS, who trade off the media profile the tactic
brings. The [group has taken credit for Friday\'s
blasts](https://www.rappler.com/nation/234192-isis-claims-responsibility-suicide-attack-military-camp-sulu),
as well as the deaths of over 30 people, killed in two previous attacks
believed to be the work of suicide bombers. The first was a [July 2018

\"[It is an escalation, but it\'s also a sign of **increased

Philippines is a **key piece of territory** because it is one of the few
places in the region where ISIS can hold ground]{.underline}, like its

The army suspects a 23-year-old Filipino carried out the latest attack
and are investigating whether it was a suicide bomb, or a remote
detonation gone wrong. \"(His) remains were claimed by the mother and
the sibling who identified him based on the head,\" Major General
Cirilito Sobejana told AFP. \"For the benefit of the doubt, we are doing
a DNA testing.\" Analysts have long feared suicide attacks would take
root in the Philippines, given the ISIS influence and presence of
foreign fighters. \"[Society is changing. Their method of attack is
changing. Suicide bombing is the current and future method of
attack]{.underline},\" said Rommel Banlaoi, chairman of the Philippine
Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research. Advertisement At
the same time, [there are strong motivations from local militant cells
to]{.underline} try to [catch the eye of the ISIS central
leadership]{.underline} with suicide attacks. [Several figures are vying
to be the designated leader in the region, with top candidates coming
from]{.underline} the ISIS-aligned [Abu Sayyaf]{.underline} network. The
kidnap-for-ransom group has engaged in bombings as well as kidnappings
of Western tourists and missionaries since the early 1990s and has in
recent years also preyed on cargo ships and fishing vessels. When IS
leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi released a propaganda video in April it
contained no mention of the East Asia wing. \"[Members of the Islamic
State in Southeast Asia might be thinking they really need to up their

//AT

Last week, authorities in Manila announced that Philippine troops had
killed Isnilon Hapilon, the deputy leader of the Abu Sayyaf Group and
apparent emir of the Islamic State in the Philippines, and Omar Maute,
one of the two brothers leading the Maute Group. Shortly after receiving
the news, President Rodrigo Duterte declared the city of Marawi
liberated from terrorist influence. The all-clear signal has not been
given yet, however. About 30 militants, including six to eight foreign
fighters, remain in the city and are continuing their fight against
Philippine troops. The militants are believed to have 20 hostages. What
started out as a hasty raid to capture Isnilon has turned into a
five-month siege. Since May, t[he Philippine military has been engaged
in combat operations against]{.underline} the Maute Group and Abu Sayyaf
--- both [Islamist militant groups]{.underline} that have pledged
loyalty to Islamic State. Nearly 750 militants have been killed, and 155
soldiers, marines, police, and 47 civilians have died. The fighting in
the city of Marawi has also displaced about 400,000 people. The violence
in Marawi spurred Duterte to declare martial law in the Southern
Philippines. [Many countries seem to think that more money, more arms,
and more specialized equipment for the Philippine military is the
appropriate response to the conflict in Marawi]{.underline}. [The United
States,]{.underline} Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and even
China [have offered varying levels of support to the
Philippines]{.underline}, ranging from assistance in intelligence and
technical expertise to rifles and bullets to mini-guns, grenade
launchers, drones, and specially equipped surveillance planes. [The
influx of arms and equipment will certainly increase the lethality of
the Philippine military, but on its own **it cannot prevent the growth
of Islamic State in the Southern Philippines**.]{.underline} These
resources are singularly focused on one tactical objective --- to bring
the crisis in Marawi to an end. However, [the crisis is not just about
recent clashes with Islamic State --- **it is a by-product of a nearly
five-decade political impasse**]{.underline} with several Moro (Filipino
Muslim) separatist groups. The inability of the various Moro groups to
agree on what constitutes self-determination and self-governance
continues to plague the Philippines and foster conflict. [Internal
strife and political disagreements amongst these Moro separatist groups
has fueled violence and furthered political and economic instability in
the Southern Philippines]{.underline}, particularly in the Autonomous
Region of Muslim Mindanao. The result has been under-governed areas and
a weak rule of law that has in the past enabled the separatist groups to
provide sanctuary to transnational terrorists, such as al-Qaeda and
Jemaah Islamiyah. The area continues to be the poorest region in the
Philippines, ranking in the bottom 10 out of 81 provinces for the past
two decades. In 2013, the U.S. State Department identified the
Sulu-Sulawasi Seas and the Southern Philippines as terrorist safe havens
in the Asia Pacific. [These conditions are precisely why Islamic State
seeks to establish a province in the Southern Philippines.]{.underline}

### No Impact

#### No risk of nuclear terrorists -- too sophisticated and they don't have the resources

**Ward 18** (Antonia Ward, Antonia Ward is an analyst on the Defense,
Security, and Infrastructure team at RAND Europe, 7/4/2018, \"Is Nuclear
Terrorism Distracting Attention from More Realistic Threats?,\" No
Publication,
https://www.rand.org/blog/2018/07/is-the-threat-of-nuclear-terrorism-distracting-attention.html)///PSC

At the final Nuclear Summit of his presidency in Washington, D.C., in
[2016, Barack Obama said the risk of ISIS or other extremist groups
acquiring nuclear weapons remains "one of the greatest threats to global
security]{.underline}." [A number of terrorist groups, including ISIS
and al-Qaeda, have expressed explicit intentions to acquire and use
nuclear material.]{.underline} However, **[countries face far more
pressing threats than nuclear terrorism and authorities would be better
off focusing on insurgents\' frequent use of conventional weapons, such
as chemicals and bombs]{.underline}**. Nuclear terrorism, defined as
"the use or threat to use nuclear material, nuclear fuel, or radioactive
products for acts of terrorism," has elicited global concern and action,
as demonstrated by the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, NATO\'s
Defence Against Terrorism Programme, and the EU Counter-Terrorism
Strategy. There is also a large amount of nuclear material present
throughout the world; the current global stockpile of highly enriched
uranium (HEU) stands at 1.6 million kg. [To construct a nuclear bomb,
terrorists would need 25 kg of HEU. This, compared to the amount held by
states throughout the world, is not an impossible amount for terrorists
to obtain]{.underline}. To contextualize this, in 2015 the United States
possessed 62,900 tons of recoverable uranium. Several terrorist groups
have declared a desire to acquire nuclear material to construct a "dirty
bomb." [In 1998, Osama bin Laden, in a speech entitled "Nuclear Bomb of
Islam" stated that, "It is the duty of Muslims to prepare as much force
as possible to terrorize the enemies of God."]{.underline} [In 2014,
after capturing the Iraqi city of Mosul, ISIS had access to two caches
of Cobalt 60 locked in a storage room]{.underline} at Mosul University.
This material has lethal levels of radiation, is used to treat cancer
cells, and is the core ingredient of a nuclear bomb. **[Government
officials and nuclear experts speculated that ISIS failed to utilize it,
because they could not determine how to access the Cobalt 60 without
exposing themselves to deadly radiation.]{.underline}** In 2016, [after
the two ISIS brothers involved in the Brussels bombings, Khalid and
Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, were killed and captured, authorities discovered
they had been secretly watching a Belgian nuclear scientist]{.underline}
who worked at the Tihange Nuclear Power Station with the potential aim
of using material from this facility. **[Nuclear terrorism is a concern,
but the majority of terror attacks are conducted with conventional
explosives]{.underline}**. Despite Obama\'s remarks in 2016 and these
two incidents, [experts and officials contest the viability of the
nuclear terrorism threat]{.underline}. Dr Beyza Unal, a research fellow
in nuclear policy at think tank Chatham House, argued [there is
currently no evidence that terrorist groups could build a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}. Similarly, a report by the Council on Foreign
Relations in 2006 emphasized how **[building a nuclear bomb is a
difficult task for states, let alone terrorists]{.underline}**. [This is
because of the issues involved in accessing uranium and creating and
maintaining it at the correct grade (enriched uranium)]{.underline}.
While nuclear terrorism is a concern, the majority of terrorist attacks
are conducted with conventional explosives. The 2017 Europol Terrorism
Situation and Trend Report states that [40 percent of terrorist attacks
used explosives]{.underline}. These explosives originate from a wide
variety of countries across the world. According to a study by Conflict
Armament Research, [large quantities of explosive precursor chemicals
used to make bombs as seen in the 7/7 attack in London in 2005 and the
2017 Manchester Arena attack, have been linked to supply chains in the
United States, Europe, and Asia via Turkey]{.underline}. The threat from
the spread of chemical precursors prompted the EU to begin looking at
ways to tighten the regulations of these chemicals (PDF). [A nuclear
terrorist attack would have grave consequences,]{.underline} **[but it
is currently not a realistic or viable threat given that it would
require a level of sophistication from terrorists that has not yet been
witnessed]{.underline}**. The recent focus of terrorist groups has been
on simplistic strikes, such as knife and vehicular attacks. If countries
are concerned about nuclear terrorism, the best way to mitigate this
risk could be to tighten security at civilian and government nuclear
sites. But governments would be better off focusing their efforts on
combatting the spread and use of conventional weapons.

#### Isis would never use nukes -- already had the material but couldn't use it and they are more inclined to use conventional weapons

In the last three years, [I have not spent much time wondering whether
ISIS has access to radioactive material. I know they have had access,
because I had a hand in getting it to them.]{.underline} In 2005, while
working for an air cargo company in Mosul, I delivered a large wooden
box, marked for consignment to the University of Mosul. To fly it in, we
needed a special plane, an Antonov-12, whose cargo hold was cavernous
compared to our usual 727s and DC-8s. The box contained, according to
its air waybill, radiological imaging equipment for the university's
teaching hospital. The next day, workers from the hospital met me at my
office, and I gently forklifted the crate into their truck. The load
seemed off-balance, and I winced when I heard a corner of the box
splinter as we strapped it down. But they drove away, and unless that
million-dollar piece of medical equipment fell off the back of the truck
and ended up strewn across the road, it probably made it safely to the
hospital, where it was captured by ISIS nine years later. [ISIS
controlled that hospital for three years, and according to a report by
Joby Warrick and Loveday Morris in The Washington Post, they left its
most dangerous radioactive material, a stash of cobalt-60,
undisturbed]{.underline}. [Used therapeutically, cobalt-60 burns away
tumors.]{.underline} When blown to smithereens, however---perhaps in a
populated area---it can poison and kill people and contaminate the
surroundings, as the dirty ingredient in a "dirty bomb." **[No dirty
bomb has ever been used. Warrick and Morris suggest that ISIS refrained
from weaponizing their cobalt-60 because they either didn't know what
they had, or doubted their ability to experiment with it without killing
themselves in the process]{.underline}**. We have plenty of reason to be
confident that if ISIS could reliably and easily make a dirty bomb, they
would do so. [In 2003, the Saudi jihadist Nasir bin Hammad al-Fahd
issued a religious ruling, now famous, that justified use of nuclear and
radiological weapons against infidels.]{.underline} Classical Islamic
law limits armies from laying absolute waste to their enemies' land and
people. Poisoning wells, devastating crops, and salting the earth are
forbidden except in exceptional circumstances. [Luckily for a
nuclear-armed jihadi, Fahd wrote, we live in precisely such
circumstances. A WMD strike would serve as a lump-sum repayment for the
countless bombs directed at Muslims---and it might in fact be the only
way Muslims could preserve themselves from domination by
nonbelievers.]{.underline} Two years ago, according to reports, Fahd
pledged allegiance to the Islamic State from his jail cell in Saudi
Arabia. If they did know what they had, I think they were wise to leave
it warehoused away, like the hazardous cargo at the end of The Raiders
of the Lost Ark. **[Radiological weapons take training to handle safely.
Three minutes in a room with unshielded cobalt-60 will kill
you]{.underline}**. **[Try to synthesize nerve gas, and you're likely to
be your own first victim]{.underline}**. It's not clear it would have
been a good use of their top talent to spend weeks or months wearing
lead pajamas and poking gingerly at a container of cobalt. Moreover,
[conventional weapons have worked beautifully for the Islamic
State]{.underline}. The Kalashnikov is the spring-loaded mousetrap of
the arms industry, highly resistant to improvement. **[And although the
Islamic State has innovated in the field of weaponry---witness their
remarkable industry in building suicide car-bombs and armed
drones---they have also, in a way, pruned back their imagination to
return to simpler forms of brutality]{.underline}**. Al-Qaeda operatives
never ceased daydreaming about diverse plots and targets: [bombing gas
stations; crop-dusting cities with napalm; snipping suspension cables on
the Brooklyn Bridge; sinking oil tankers; and many other plots that we
never heard about]{.underline}. The Islamic State has an R & D team as
well, but it sometimes seems that its first observation was that these
imaginative plots tended to happen only in the plotters' imaginations.
[The simple ones---stabbing random people, or setting off bombs, or
driving a truck through a crowd, or blocking exits at a concert and
machine-gunning everyone in sight---frequently come to fruition, and
kill more people than the daydreamers' plots would have, even if
successfully pulled off. **The most creative terrorist plots (think
September 11 as the epitome of creativity) are not necessarily the most
effective**]{.underline}. The Islamic State realized this, and adapted.
[A dozen stabbings collectively generate as much fear as a single
successful spectacular attack---or a hundred unsuccessful spectacular
attacks]{.underline}. And no one can control access to knives, at least
not until the government starts monitoring sales in the cutlery section
of Crate and Barrel. **[By comparison, nuclear and radiological material
is much more easily controlled]{.underline}**. **[If any government
notices an ISIS cell with access to radioactive or even fissile
material, the United States and other governments will almost certainly
devote immense resources to making sure it is never used]{.underline}**.
Will ISIS nuke us, or render part of a city uninhabitable with a dirty
bomb? Yes, if they can. But so far, it isn't entirely irrational for
them not even to have tried.

[This]{.underline} [[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} [[trusting foreign

if Luxembourg declared war on France]{.mark} [and Germany]{.mark}

**[The real existential threat remains other nations, [particularly

Russia in the 19th century. Russia was rife with terrorism. The Czar
himself was assassinated in 1881! It preoccupied the people of that
time. And yet the horrors of the ensuing world wars dwarfed the impact
of terrorism such that it is virtually forgotten today.

### K of Terror Framing

#### You should call the DA into question -- the US justifies colonial domination under the guise of the "War on Terror"

**Juan**, **PhD, 15**

(E San Jr., 2-2-2015, He obtained a PhD degree from Harvard University
in 1965 with the help of a Rockefeller fellowship and Harvard teaching
fellowship\].\[1\] He was a fellow of the Rockefeller Study Center in
Bellagio, Italy, \"Tracking the Spoors of Imperialism & Neocolonialism
in the Philippines: Sketch of a Synoptic Reconnaissance,\" Portside,

Since 2002, the joint annual military exercises called \"Philippine-US
Bilateral Exercises\" have been held allegedly to give humanitarian
assistance during natural disasters to victimized provinces. They also
offer weapons, logistics and other support to the government campaigns
to secure peace and order in war zones, or in vital metropolitan areas
(as in the 2012 exercise around the National Capitol Region). Just like
the Civic Action programs refined during the anti-Huk drives of the
fifties, these exercises supplement violent repression with psywar and
other unconventional techniques to win \"hearts and minds,\" closely
following the U.S. Counterinsurgency Guide of 2009 and its associated
field manuals. President Arroyo\'s Oplan Bantay Laya and President
Benigno Aquino\'s Oplan Bayanihan are updated versions of the
counterinsurgency strategy and tactics applied by the U.S. in Vietnam,
El Salvador, Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. [They combine intensive
military operations, intelligence and civic action or triad operations,
conventional warfare methods, and counterguerilla tactics.]{.underline}
[The U.S. learned as much from its tutelage of its colonial subjects as
Filipinos did through a cross-fertilization of security and espionage
practices.]{.underline} The historian Alfred McCoy concludes his
inventory of such practices with the remark: \"Empire has been a
reciprocal process, shaping state formation in Manila and Washington
while moving both nations into a mutually implicated postcolonial
world\" (2009, 522). The 1951 [Mutual Defense Treaty continues to
legitimize U.S. \"low intensity warfare,\"]{.underline} such as the
sustained anti-NPA drives during President Corazon Aquino\'s tenure
(Bello 1989). During the Arroyo presidency, the U.S. maintained official
headquarters of the U.S.-Philippine Joint Special Operations Task Force
Philippines (JSOTF-P) inside the Camp Navarro of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines\' Western Mindanao Comnmand in Zamboanga City where Moro
insurgents are active. [Drones and other sophisticated equipment are
handled by U.S. Special Forces against]{.underline} the Abu Sayyaf now
valorized as [an Al Qaida offshoot]{.underline}, with linkages to other
recent terrorist groups such as the Jemaah Islamiyah and the Islamic
State (ISIS) in Syria. To supplement JUSMAG, a new agency called Defense
Policy Board was created to handle issues of international terrorism,
maritime safety, transnational crime, natural disasters, pandemic
outbreaks, etc. Other \"cooperative security locations\" (as these
facilities are euphemistically called) are found in Clark, Subic, Mactan
International Airport, and in other clandestine areas (Klare 2005). [It
is in these areas occupied by U.S. advisers and staff where torture,
enforced disappearances, and extra-judicial killings occur.]{.underline}
One recent case is that of American health worker Melissa Roxas who was
kidnapped and tortured by military agents in 2009. Documenting the
accelerated kidnappings and extra-judicial murders of activists already
publicized by Amnesty International and UN rapporteurs such as Philip
Alston, the Filipino group [KARAPATAN noted the **1,111 percent
increase** of military assistance]{.underline} to the Arroyo regime
beginning 2001 when the first Balikatan exercise was held (Lefebvre
2010). [This aid continues indiscrimiinately with horrendous
consequences]{.underline}. Provisional Coda In March 2007, the Permanent
People\'s Tribunal based in Europe heard witnesses about government
abuses and judged Presidents Bush and Arroyo guilty of crimes against
humanity\" (San Juan 2007, Appendix C). [The verdict reviews the U.S.
imposition of virtual colonial status on the Philippines via numerous
military and security agreements that insured domination over the
economy, State apparatus, and internal security. Under the **guise of
the global \"war on terror\"** against extremists, the U.S. **continues
to deploy and station thousands of troops**, at any one time, in the
Philippines. They participate in combat operations against local
insurgents\--a gross violation of Philippine sovereignty and territorial
integrity.]{.underline} The Tribunal observed that \"because of its
strategic location, [the Philippines is vital for the U.S. projection of
military force in East Asia]{.underline} and as far away as the Middle
East,\" [serving as transit points and refueling stations in its wars of
aggression against the people of Afghanistan and of Iraq, as well as the
people of the Philippines]{.underline}. President Bush was an accomplice
of President Arroyo in the systematic violation of the rights of the
Filipino people, which are also crimes of humanity. U.S. mperialism was
indicted as an international scourge. From the sixteenth century to the
present, imperialism, whether in the mode of Spanish old-style
colonialism, Japanese militarism, and U.S. tutelage in
modernization/developmentalism, represents one of the worst
manifestations of an oppressive system of exploitation of peoples that
have been outlawed by the United Nations Charter and its Declaration of
Human Rights. Nonetheless, it persists today in the Philippines where a
people\'s national-democratic, socialist-oriented revolution, with a
long and durable tradition, thrives in a collective project to eradicate
this historic legacy (San Juan 2008) The history of the Philippines may
be read as one long chronicle of the people\'s struggle against
colonialism and imperialism for the sake of affirming human dignity and
universal justice.

#### ScanEagle drones cause conflict with china and don't deter them, plan removes the drones and tensions

**Jennings 6/10** (Ralph Jennings, reporter, 6-10-2019, \"China Will
Treat US Drones as Move to Dent its Contested Maritime Claims,\" Voice
of America,
https://www.voanews.com/east-asia/china-will-treat-us-drones-move-dent-its-contested-maritime-claims)///PSC

TAIPEI - Officials in [Beijing will treat \$47.9 billion in U.S. drone
sales approved for Southeast Asia as another effort to dent their claims
to the disputed South China Sea]{.underline}, experts believe, [and lash
back verbally as well as economically]{.underline}. The U.S. Department
of Defense said May 31 American contractor Insitu would sell 34
ScanEagle unmanned air vehicles to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines
and Vietnam. All four have chafed against China's coast guard and other
vessels over the past decade as they vie for control over the
resource-rich sea. [The United States has no claim to the sea, a
3.5-million-square-kilometer waterway between Hong Kong and the island
of Borneo, but Washington wants to keep it open for international
use.]{.underline} China claims about 90 percent of the sea, where it has
developed small islets for military use. [The Southeast Asian states lag
China in military might.]{.underline} Already wary of U.S. navy forays
into the sea and Washington's earlier pledges to upgrade military ties
around Asia, **[Beijing will probably respond to the drones with
official anti-U.S. statements and increases in economic aid to the drone
buyers]{.underline}**, which might otherwise shift foreign policy toward
Washington, political scientists say. "[I think that Beijing will see
(drone sales) as the United States interfering in what China understands
is its core interest, the South China Sea, and Beijing will use this as
an opportunity to strengthen the domestic narrative that the United
States is attempting to challenge China on many of its core
interests]{.underline}," said Stephen Nagy, senior associate politics
and international studies professor at International Christian
University in Tokyo. Drones for Chinese rivals The American contractor
has approval to sell 12 drones to Malaysia, eight to Indonesia, another
eight to the Philippines and six to Vietnam, the defense department
website says. Deliveries due by 2022 would include spare payloads, spare
parts, support equipment and training for the hardware that check
Chinese maritime activity from the air, the website says. [Indonesia
doesn't have a claim to the sea, but it periodically challenges Chinese
vessels near its outlying Natuna island chain]{.underline}. ​[The other
three drone recipients claim waters that overlap what China calls its
own]{.underline}. China cites historical use of those waters; the other
countries use exclusive economic zone boundaries defined under
international law. [Vietnam and the Philippines have sparred with
Chinese vessels in the past. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
is taking a tougher stance against China than his predecessor
did]{.underline}. U.S. officials have twinned more than a year of
trade-tariff pressure on China with multiple naval vessel passages
through the sea. At the Shangri-la Dialogue defense chiefs' forum in
Singapore June 1, Acting **[U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan
pledged more military cooperation in Asia -- and criticized China's
expansion]{.underline}**. **[The drone sales belong to a "bigger
narrative" from China's view]{.underline}**, said Eduardo Araral,
associate professor at the National University of Singapore's public
policy school. ​Chinese response **[China may protest briefly against the
drone sales and will probably stir domestic opinion in its favor,
analysts expect]{.underline}**. "I think what you would see is that the
spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (is) reacting, but
that's probably not so much," Araral said. "[The Chinese would say 'what
else is for the drones to discover that the satellites couldn't discover
and that the people on the ground don't know?'" The drones, being just
for surveillance, are not expected to spark a militarily response or
make China scale back the past decade of maritime
expansion]{.underline}. China uses its own drones and radar systems in
the sea that's prized for fisheries, oil, gas and commercial shipping
lanes. ["Of course they don't like it, but is this really going to
change the tide in the South China Sea?]{.underline}" said Yun Sun, East
Asia Program senior associate with the Stimson Center think tank in
Washington, D.C. "Probably not, especially if we take into consideration
the relation that China currently has with these Southeast Asian
countries \-- everything seems to be under control, at least from the
Chinese perspective," she said. **[More aid to Southeast Asia Beijing
may seek to increase that control by strengthening its own appeal among
Southeast Asian countries -- possibly forcing them to choose between
China and the United States -- some analysts say]{.underline}**. The
appeal would be economic. China, backed by the world's second largest
GDP, has helped build infrastructure in Malaysia and the Philippines to
date while helping Vietnam by expanding tourism. Some of the aid fits
into China's \$1 trillion pan-Eurasia Belt-and-Road Initiative to open
trade routes through new infrastructure. The United States lacks China's
level of economic relations in Southeast Asia. The Communist leadership
might also try to "fracture" a 10-member negotiating bloc, the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, that includes the four drone
buyers, Nagy said.

[Funding for FMS purchases is generally provided by the foreign country.
However, **for certain countries**, funds are appropriated
by]{.underline} Congress for Foreign Military Financing
("**[FMF]{.underline}**").22 By law, [Israel and Egypt receive most
of]{.underline} the [FMF]{.underline}-appropriated funds. 23 [Other
countries receive smaller amounts]{.underline}, based upon a
justification provided to Congress by the U.S. Department of State.
Section 23 of the AECA provides authority to finance the procurement of
defense articles and services by friendly foreign countries through
credit sales. However, in recent years, the [legislation appropriating
FMF has]{.underline} 7 [stipulated that it is provided on a
non-repayable basis (]{.underline}i.e., [FMF is now provided as a grant
and not a loan]{.underline}). 24 Furthermore, the appropriations
language states that the funds are "obligated upon apportionment"25; the
effect of this language is that the funds do not expire at the end of
the fiscal year are available for expenditure in future years so long as
they have been apportioned, even if they have not yet been obligated.
[Certain countries have been approved to use FMF to make **d**irect
**c**ommercial **s**ales purchases]{.underline}. These purchases, [known
as]{.underline} "direct commercial contracts" (a
"**[DCC]{.underline}**"), 26 are discussed in more detail in the next
section of this paper. DSCA approves DCCs on a case-by-case basis
pursuant to a set of guidelines published on the DSCA website.27 D.
Other Financial Issues The general rule for payment for an FMS case is
that payment is due upon signing.28 However, payment may be made at a
later time if a country is able to give a "dependable undertaking" to
pay the full amount of the contract and to make funds available in such
amounts and at such times as may be required by the contract. The time
of payment for countries that are able to give a dependable undertaking
will be a matter of negotiation, but generally, the payment due date
will not be delayed beyond the delivery date, although there are rare
exceptions.29 Whether the terms of sale of an FMS LOA will be able to
include a dependable undertaking will depend upon the country's
Interagency Country Risk Assessment System ("ICRAS") rating. If a
country does not have an ICRAS rating, DSCA may determine eligibility
using the DSCA Dependable Undertaking Assessment Tool. In general, a
country with an ICRAS rating of "C" or better at the time of receipt of
the LOR is presumed to be eligible to have the term of sale for
dependable undertaking included in its FMS LOA, unless other factors
override that eligibility determination.30 8 In general, [purchasing
countries pay with their national funds, unless they]{.underline} have
been allocated, and [are using, **FMF**]{.underline}. However, it is
possible that a third source could provide funding to the purchasing
country, which the purchasing country could use to pay for its FMS case.
The AECA provides that purchases using FMS must be in U.S. dollars,
regardless of the source of the payment.31

The Philippines [will]{.underline} likely [complete]{.underline} [an
arms purchase]{.underline} [from]{.underline} a blacklisted
[Russian]{.underline} [firm]{.underline} **[in defiance of
sanctions]{.underline}** [imposed on Russia by the United
States.]{.underline} The Philippines agreed in October 2017 to purchase
750 RPG-7B rocket launchers from Russia's state-owned Rosoboronexport.
However, [this could lead to possible sanctions on the Philippines due
to the U.S. policy of imposing sanctions against countries that traded
with "Russia's defense and intelligence sectors," according to
[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-defence-usa-russia-exclus/exclusive-philippines-could-breach-u-s-sanctions-if-russia-arms-deal-proceeds-idUSKBN1K817L).]{.underline}
These [sanctions]{.underline} are [meant]{.underline} [to punish Russia
for its annexation of Crimea]{.underline}, interference in the 2016
election and aggression toward its neighbors like Ukraine, according to
Reuters. Russia has donated military gear to the Philippines, such as
assault rifles and trucks, but this would be the first time the
Philippines purchased weapons from Moscow, Reuters reported. Philippines
President Rodrigo Duterte has pivoted toward Russia and China since he
was elected, straining the Philippines' historical alliance with the
U.S. He has also [insulted American

such as former President Barack Obama. Duterte
[canceled](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-cancels-u-s-weapon-deal-article-1.2863842)
an arms deal with the United States in 2017 because of U.S. lawmakers
seeking to block the sale of 26,000 assault rifles due to concerns over
Duterte's drug war that has killed thousands. He also canceled a
helicopter deal with Canada worth \$233 million because Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau's government ordered a review of the deal,
[according](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/philippines-to-cancel-helicopter-deal-with-canada-duterte-says/article37917169/)
to The Globe and Mail. A Department of State official told Reuters
"significant transactions with any of the 39 listed entities will result
in sanctions" and that foreign governments and private companies have
been "put on notice" about the potential action. The official, however,
declined to say if the U.S. would impose any specific sanctions on the
Philippines if the Asian country went forward with the purchase. The
Department of the Treasury also declined to tell Reuters about possible
sanctions, telling them they did not "telegraph sanctions or comment on
prospective actions." Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque said the
Philippines is free to enter any deal with any nation, no matter what
the U.S. desires, according to the [Philippine
Star](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/07/19/1834974/philippines-free-enter-arms-purchase-russia-roque-says).
"I don't know how US law would be applicable to a transaction that will
be done outside of the United States," he told reporters Thursday in a
press briefing. Jose Antonio Custodio, a Filipino military analyst and
historian, told Reuters **[the arms deal would strain the Philippines'
military relations with the U.S., Australia and Japan.]{.underline}**
"[If the Duterte]{.underline} administration [keeps]{.underline} on
[elevating the]{.underline} military-to-military [relationship with
Russia]{.underline}, it [may]{.underline} [lead]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} push back from these allies given [international
sanctions]{.underline} on that country for bad behavior," Custodio said.
Roque said the deal would go under review, but stressed that the
Philippines had "immunity." "We have immunity, and we are free to enter
into contracts as we please, and we are not bound by any domestic law
especially if the transaction will not occur on US soil," he said.

[Terrorism is America's most active worry, but it is quite modest in
practice and **does not endanger the nation's existence**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [persistent intervention in other nations' affairs---such as
battling Islamic insurgents in the Philippines---is **more likely to
create rather than eradicate enemies** determined to harm
America]{.underline}. [If the PRC some day possesses the means to
conduct global war against the U.S., Manila's decrepit armed forces
won't matter much]{.underline}. The [Philippines would be but a speed
bump to Chinese ambitions]{.underline}, [a weak America-allied outpost
vulnerable to attack.]{.underline} [Washington has designated the
Philippines a major non-NATO ally, but that's]{.underline} obviously
[just a friendly lie to stroke Manila's ego.]{.underline} The main
military value of the Philippines is to act as a base for U.S.
operations, these days mostly directed against the PRC. Washington
officials have come to see domination of the Asia-Pacific as an American
birthright. Bases allow U.S. forward deployment of military forces. For
this reason, Mira Rapp-Hooper of the Center for a New American Security
argues that "over the last eight years, the Philippines has become the
linchpin of U.S. diplomatic and national security strategy in Southeast
Asia." Actually, **[Manila is a dubious linchpin of
anything]{.underline}**. [A semi-failed state with an erratic and
lawless leader is hardly a reliable partner]{.underline}. Moreover, the
Philippines wants American assistance in its defense. [Manila most
assuredly does not want to help America battle China on behalf
of]{.underline} other nations, including [the U.S]{.underline}. After
all, [the alliance with America turns the Philippines into a Chinese
target]{.underline}. Walden Bello, who served in the Philippine congress
before joining Japan's Center for Southeast Asian Studies, warned that
his nation is "on the front lines of a superpower struggle for hegemony
in the Asia-Pacific region." Washington sees Manila as part of a
containment strategy. [If war erupted between the U.S. and China, the
former would expect to use its Philippine bases]{.underline}, making
them a legitimate target for the PRC even if the Philippines formally
stayed out of the conflict. [Officials in Manila likely would be
**unwilling to grant the U.S. access to bases** at the very moment when
the Pentagon most desired to use them]{.underline}.

[America]{.underline} is a curious great power. It [cowers before
international lightweights, begging the least significant nations to let
it defend them. Such as the Philippines.]{.underline} President Rodrigo
[Duterte has gained notoriety for the official murder of thousands of
drug users and dealers.]{.underline} He then publicly insulted President
Obama for criticizing this murderous policy. [**United States
credibility suffers** when a nation long subsidized and defended by
America shows such ostentatious disrespect]{.underline}. The [Philippine
president shouldn't be treated like a co-equal and ally if he doesn't
behave like one.]{.underline} Moreover, **[the Philippines needs America
far more than America needs the Philippines]{.underline}**. [Manila
spends less than 1 percent of its gross domestic product on its military
and its best ships are U.S. cast-offs. **It doesn't help defend the
United States from anyone.**]{.underline} Rather, [Manila expects
Washington's protection even though the archipelago matters little for
the United States]{.underline}. [America retains the Pacific as a
barrier and faces **no serious threats to its homeland.**]{.underline}
Of course, Washington sees domination of East Asia as an American
birthright. Base access obviously helps the U.S. attempt to enforce its
will. However[, convenience does not translate into interests
substantial enough to risk war.]{.underline} The region matters far more
to nearby China, which understandably does not want to be contained. It
also costs Beijing far less to deter U.S. intervention than it does for
America to project power: missiles and subs are less costly than
aircraft carrier groups. With no one threatening free navigation,
[Washington must decide what kind of risk it is willing to take on
behalf of what remain primarily other nations' territorial interests.
Insisting on defending the Philippines irrespective of its actions is
particularly dangerous]{.underline}. [Manila]{.underline} relies on
American support rather than its own military in confronting China [and
could **drag the United States into a conflict easily.** Washington
should drop the "mutual" defense treaty and joint patrols]{.underline}.
Maintaining base access is good insurance but does not require a
security guarantee, especially over contested territory, such as
Scarborough Shoal. Moreover, [such access is not worth paying any
price]{.underline}: America lost no influence when Subic Bay and Clark
Airfield closed decades ago. President [Duterte is not a reliable ally.
The United States should not allow such an unpredictable regime to be a
trigger for war.]{.underline}

[The U.S.-Philippine alliance is not an agreement between
the]{.underline} government of [the United States and]{.underline}
President Rodrigo [Duterte. **It is a compact between the peoples of our
two countries.** Alliances are built on shared interests]{.underline},
but they are [**strengthened by shared history and values**. The
Philippines and the United States have all three]{.underline} in spades.
[The alliance]{.underline}, formalized in the 1951 Mutual Defense
Treaty, was forged in the shared sacrifices of World War II and
continued through wars in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq, as well as the
global fight against jihadist terrorism. It evolved from its Cold War
roots, through the lean years between the ouster of U.S. forces from
bases in the Philippines in 1992 and the signing of the Visiting Forces
Agreement in 1998, to a decade-and-a-half of joint operations against
terrorists in the southern Philippines, and [now a **shared commitment
to counter the maritime coercion** Beijing has brought to bear against
Filipino troops and civilians in the South China Sea.]{.underline} As
such, it is understandable that [when Duterte announced a "separation"
from the United States,]{.underline} both in economic and security
relations, [**most Filipinos were as shocked**]{.underline} as their
U.S. counterparts. I was in Manila at the time sharing in the disbelief
that greeted his proclamation. A [break from the United States **is not
what the people of the Philippines want**]{.underline} --- a poll
published just days before Duterte's announcement in Beijing found that
76 percent of Filipinos have "much trust" in the United States, more
than any other country in the poll, while 55 percent have "little trust"
in China. Polling by Pew last year found that an astounding [92 percent
of Filipinos have positive views of the United States --- higher than
any other citizenry in the world --- and 71 percent support a greater
U.S. military presence in Asia. The United States is the third-largest
trading partner of the Philippines,]{.underline} after Japan and China.
It is the [number-two investor in the country]{.underline}, providing
over one-fifth of foreign direct investment in 2013 while investment
from China is negligible. It is also the [largest source of remittances
to the economy,]{.underline} thanks to the huge Filipino-American
community, and a [major provider of development assistance.]{.underline}
Little wonder then that **[Duterte's economic team issued a statement
within hours contradicting his pledge of economic separation from the
United States.]{.underline}** Within 24 hours of Duterte's speech in
Beijing, he had been publicly rebutted by Philippine senators, respected
statesmen, and prominent experts. Almost immediately upon returning to
Manila on Friday, he walked back his statement, but the fallout
continues. In addition to spooking his own people, Duterte has other
international partners deeply worried, including Japan, which said it
was seeking clarification from Duterte during his visit to Tokyo this
week. For over three months, the new government in Manila has blindsided
American counterparts with a verbal barrage that is clearly at odds with
the realities of the U.S.-Philippine alliance. This has caused
confusion, hurt feelings, and, in some quarters, anger. But the Obama
administration deserves credit for recognizing that, [despite the noise,
**most in the Philippines do not share Duterte's foreign policy views
and will not support an abrogation of our alliance**]{.underline}. The
United States has responded with calm in the face of the storm, choosing
only to reiterate U.S. commitment to the Philippines.

Impact on local politics and government[. Duterte's almost singular
focus on the drug war has far-reaching consequences for the country's
local politics and governance.]{.underline} In many respects,
subnational government in the Philippines is highly decentralized, but
most local government units (LGUs) are dependent upon central government
funding and grapple with the challenge of unfunded mandates**[. LGUs are
key actors in the drug war, and local officials need to juggle multiple
and sometimes conflicting priorities, including protecting their
citizens, cooperating with local law enforcement, and demonstrating
results to central authorities.]{.underline}** And as reported by
Rappler, a respected Philippine news website, the drug war has caused a
major shift in LGU priorities: At the local level, the [drug war has
changed the way barangays \[the smallest LGUs\] spend their
funds]{.underline}. . . . **[Traditional social services such as medical
clinics or feeding programs for malnourished children are no longer
budget priorities]{.underline}**. Through a number of policy incentives
as well as strict supervision by the DILG, the priority at the barangay
level has now become the monitoring and surveillance of drug suspects
and the rehabilitation of drug users who have surrendered. There also is
a darker dimension to the drug war at the local level. Peter Kreuzer
notes the pressure and intimidation experienced by local officials: It
has become [highly problematic for local political elites to evade the
president's injunction to participate in the anti-crime killing spree
that is engulfing the Philippines]{.underline}. . . . The various
reshuffles are placing more hard-line police officers in command
positions. Furthermore, these officers are well aware that results
measured in dead bodies are expected of them. In addition, **[police
officers and politicians alike have been publicly denounced as
supporting and profiting from drug crimes and thus threatened not only
with being indicted]{.underline}**, but also with becoming victims of
extrajudicial executions themselves. Most officials then choose to fall
in line with the president.43

MANILA --- [The Philippines protested a Chinese vessel hitting a
Philippine fishing boat in disputed waters, a **serious blip** in the
warming friendship between Philippine]{.underline} President Rodrigo
Duterte [and Beijing]{.underline}. The boat, FB Gimber1, was anchored
when it sank Sunday near Reed Bank in the South China Sea, a territory
claimed by both countries. Its 22 crewmen were left at sea, but later
saved by a passing vessel from Vietnam. [The Philippine Defense
Department **condemned** "the **cowardly action**" by the Chinese
vessel]{.underline} on Wednesday, just as the Philippines celebrated
Independence Day. "[This is not the expected action from a
**responsible** and **friendly** people]{.underline}," Defense Secretary
Delfin Lorenzana said. [Foreign Affairs Secretary]{.underline} Teddy
Locsin announced in a tweet on Thursday that he [filed a diplomatic
protest]{.underline}. Lt. Col. Stephen Penetrante,
[spokesman]{.underline} of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Command
monitoring the area, [said]{.underline} the military has reason to
believe [the incident was not an accident]{.underline}. [The collision
**tests** Duterte's **embrace of Beijing**, a major partner in his
economic policy and infrastructure program]{.underline}. Since Duterte's
rise to power in 2016, his administration has dialed down on declaring
protests to China's increasing military presence in the area. Duterte is
best known for a bloody drug war that has left thousands dead, and a
tough-talking demeanor that his supporters say prompted the United
States' return of [pillaged war

and Canada's recent acceptance of [tons of

shipped to the Philippines in 2013. But the president has been observed
to be less firm with China, repeatedly stressing that the Philippines
cannot afford a war over the maritime dispute. Critics believe Duterte's
approach is easing the territory right into Beijing's hands. Jay
Batongbacal, director of the University of the Philippines' Institute
for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea, said [the incident shows that
Duterte cannot bank on his personal rapport with]{.underline} Chinese
President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping. "It only goes to show that
[**despite**]{.underline} this [**friendship**, . . . China's behavior
has **not really changed**,"]{.underline} he said. "It might be said
that [China is now **abusing** the government\'s inaction. \... that's
why something like this could happen, so close to our shores, against
our own citizens." Presidential spokesman]{.underline} Salvador Panelo
called on Chinese authorities Thursday to impose sanctions on those
involved, but did not remark on whether the collision was intentional.
He call[ed the collision a "**crystal clear** violation of maritime
protocol."]{.underline} ["Regardless of the nature of the
collision]{.underline}, whether it was accidental or intentional, common
[**decency** and the **dictates of humanity** require the immediate
saving of the crew of the]{.underline} downed Philippine
[vessel]{.underline}," Panelo said in a statement. The Chinese Embassy
in Manila did not immediately respond. The Permanent Court of
Arbitration in The Hague ruled that the disputed territory in the South
China Sea was covered by the Philippines' sovereign rights. China has
refused to recognize the decision. Former government officials filed a
complaint against Xi at the International Criminal Court this year. They
accused China of destroying marine areas in the disputed waters, a move
that affects the livelihoods of fishermen there. Batongbacal said [the
collision should be a "**wake-up call**" for changes in Duterte's
policy. "If the action taken by China on this incident is
**unsatisfactory** --- if they ignore or downplay it --- we can expect
it will be repeated in the future]{.underline}," he said. "[Or that
China will **further abuse** the friendship the Philippines has shown to
it."]{.underline}

#### No link -- plan is bipartisan

Statement on the Bipartisan Enhancing Human Rights in Arms Sales Act of

\\ //AT

Mr. President, today [I rise to speak about the Enhancing Human Rights
in Arms Sales Act of 2019]{.underline}, which I was proud to introduce
on Monday with my colleagues, Senators Dick Durbin, Ron Wyden and Ed
Markey. Senators Jeff Merkley, Chris Van Hollen, Robert Casey, and Rand
Paul also cosponsored the bill this week. [Our **bipartisan bill** takes
critical steps to ensure that U.S. manufactured weapons are not used in
the commission of heinous war crimes]{.underline}, the repression of
human rights, or by terrorists who seek to do harm to Americans and
innocent civilians abroad. We do not only have a moral obligation to
ensure that U.S. weapons are used responsibly, but it is clearly in our
national security interest. As you may be aware, Mr. President, the
United States is the world's leading arms supplier. According to data
compiled by the Security Assistance Monitor, from 2002 to 2016, the
United States has delivered more than \$286 billion worth of major
conventional weapons and related military support to 200 recipients. The
Cato Institute found that more than 40% of nations purchasing these arms
are at high risk of instability, terror, or egregious human rights
abuses. There are far too many examples of what can happen when we sell
or transfer arms without proper vetting. In Yemen, U.S. arms transferred
to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and their coalition, have been
linked to more than 1,000 civilian casualties, according to a recent
report from a coalition of local and international human rights NGOs. In
December 2017, the Trump administration lifted a freeze on weapons
transfers to Nigeria to sell 12 Super Tucano A-29 aircraft and thousands
of bombs and rockets worth \$593 million, according to a Reuters report.
Earlier that same year, the BBC reported that at least 115 civilians
were killed in a Nigerian military airstrike on an IDP camp. 20 Red
Cross humanitarian aid workers were among the casualties. [Reuters
reports that since 2000, the United States has provided close to \$1
billion worth of military equipment to the Philippines, ranging from
surveillance planes, drones and boats to small arms. Human Rights Watch
estimates that at least 4,000 men, women, and children have been killed
by some of the country's security forces in the government's anti-drug
campaign]{.underline}. [President Duterte has openly encouraged the
security forces to engage in extra-judicial killings]{.underline}.
[**Congress recently prevented the Administration from selling small
arms to the Philippines**, but insufficient end use monitoring prevents
us from knowing if U.S. weapons were used in the commission of these
abuses]{.underline}. In Guatemala, according to the Washington Post,
authorities used U.S.-supplied armored J-8 Jeeps to intimidate U.S.
diplomats and international anti-corruption investigators in August
2018. Just weeks later, the U.S. provided an additional shipment of
similar jeeps to the Guatemalan government. Just to repeat, Mr.
President, our diplomats were threatened by the weapons that we
ourselves provided. This is far from the only threat American citizens
and our partners face from American-made weapons. Numerous
investigations found that the dispersion of American-supplied arms in
Iraq made up a significant portion of ISIS' weapons supply in the
country. This legislation will help curb these dangerous practices by
requiring Secretary of State to make human rights certifications for
certain arms sales and transfers, specifically those involving heavy
weapons capable of causing mass casualties or destruction, such as
attack aircraft and missile launchers. The bill also requires the
Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, to
develop a strategy to enhance human rights protections in the arms
transfer process. Since we know abuses can take place years after
weapons have been transferred, the bill amends the Arms Control Export
act to ensure stringent end use monitoring with regard to human rights.
America's strength around the world is rooted in our values. Through
this legislation, the Senate can send a strong message that the United
States must not send U.S.-made arms to countries that abuse human
rights, attack civilians, recruit child soldiers, or are unable to keep
weapons out of the hands of extremist groups. These common sense
measures ensure that arms transfers take place in a responsible manner
that safeguards our security and protects human rights.

## 2AC -- Framework Turns (for K aff)

### 2AC -- Radical Education Good

#### Explicitly radicalizing arms trade scholarship can materially challenge oppression while still engaging the question of changing arms policy, but plan focus furthers academic militarization and gets coopted even if you have radical intent or are "just playing the game"

**Stavrianakis, 6**---Senior Lecturer in International Relations and
Director of Teaching and Learning in the School of Global Studies,
University of Sussex (Anna, "Call to Arms: The University as a Site of
Militarised Capitalism and a Site of Struggle," Millenium: Journal of
International Studies, Vol 35, Issue 1, 2006, dml)

[**University investments in** and **relationships with arms
companies**]{.underline} and the MoD [raise the **wider issue** of the
**role of**]{.underline} the university in contemporary UK society, and
the appropriate relationship between [**academic research** and
**activism**. Universities can be understood as **sites of struggle**,
of "both **domination** and **contestation**."38 The **educational
apparatus**]{.underline} (in its public and private forms) [is a **key
organ** of civil society that helps **generate consent**
and]{.underline}, thereby, **[hegemony]{.underline}**.39 [Universities
help **reproduce the means of production** and, alongside **schools**,
are one of the **most significant social institutions** in which
**children** and]{.underline} (predominantly **[young]{.underline}**)
[**adults learn the attitudes** and **social rules required** for the
**perpetuation of the capitalist system**]{.underline}. The engineering
and social science **[research]{.underline}** carried out at Bristol
thus [fulfils a **dual function** of contributing to the **development
of weaponry** and **legitimising this process** and the **militarisation
of social life** that accompanies it]{.underline}. Social science
research that normalises the use of force also plays a significant role
in contributing to capitalist hegemony. [While universities **bolster
hegemonic social formations**, they can also **play a role in fostering
counter-hegemony**]{.underline}, however, as the student protests
demonstrate. [We need to **interrogate the ways** in which universities
"**mediate** and **legitimate the social** and **cultural reproduction
of class**, **racial**, and **gender relations** in the dominant
society" and also **serve oppositional interests**]{.underline}.40 [They
do this through the **alliances they forge** with other social
forces]{.underline} (e.g. through investments), [and through
**research** and **teaching**]{.underline}. The focus of this section
now turns to research in the social sciences (in particular,
International Relations (IR), my own discipline) and the potential for
activist scholarship. If universities are sites of both domination and
contestation, what does this mean for [research]{.underline}? Primarily,
it means that it [is a **political activity**]{.underline}. That is,
**[what academics choose to research]{.underline}** (and what they put
on their teaching syllabi) [is **intimately related** to their
**worldviews** and **value systems**]{.underline}. As Max Weber argued,
"all knowledge of cultural reality ... is always knowledge from
particular points of view."41 [Issues that require and/or receive
academic investigation **do not exist objectively** but within a **frame
of reference** that **constitutes them as a problem**: "without the
**investigator's evaluative ideas**, there would be **no principle of
selection of subject-matter** and **no meaningful knowledge of the
concrete reality**."]{.underline}42 At present, [it is **only those
arguments that challenge mainstream values** and **ideas** that are
**recognised as political**: the **inherent political situatedness** of
mainstream arguments **goes unnoticed precisely because it is
unremarkable**]{.underline}.43 This applies as much to scientists and
engineers as it does to IR scholars. As documented above, the problems
for which scientists and engineers seek solutions exist within a
framework that is significantly influenced by the needs of the arms
industry. [The problems that]{.underline} IR [scholars seek to analyse
are **influenced by the frameworks** governing the
discipline]{.underline}, [such as the]{.underline} ESRC's [**emphasis on
priority areas** and **demands for policy engagement**. This
emphasis]{.underline}, in addition to the principle of having to apply
competitively for funding to carry out research, a core academic duty,
[serves to **orient the discipline in particular directions**, towards
the **instrumentalisation** and **commercialisation of academic
research**. **Even those** who seek to "**play the game**"
**further**]{.underline} entrench the principle of external funding and
[**reproduce the discourse of policy relevance** in order to **win
resources** to conduct their own, critical research. Conducting
policy-relevant research is **not necessarily antithetical to
challenging oppression**: **targeted interventions** in the policy
process **can be effective**, but **run the significant risk of
co-option**. Being accepted as policy relevant **requires** that one
**use the same vocabulary** and **conceptual language** as those
**making** or **implementing policy**, and this **generally requires
acceptance** of the **parameters within which a policy is framed**. Even
those who **seek to use this vocabulary for strategic gain** have to
**negotiate the hurdles of co-option** and **neutralisation**. Policy
relevance is **often reduced to improving the processes** through which
a policy is implemented; yet such an approach **sidelines debate** about
the **values** and **goals** that inform policy. It is **difficult** for
those who **seek to challenge oppression** through policy engagement to
**have an impact** on value choices]{.underline}, however. [They are
**unlikely to have access to** or **credibility with elite actors**
because their critical stance **disadvantages them** in the networking
that is intrinsic to academia]{.underline} (as in any other profession).
[If we accept that research is a political activity, how are we to
proceed? Two potential strategies spring to mind. One is based
on]{.underline} Max [Weber's]{.underline} dictum that "the prophet and
the demagogue do not belong on the academic platform."44 Academics have
a socially privileged role that should not be abused by advancing
political positions that carry extra weight because of the authority
invested in the speaker. For Weber, objectivity is not the same as moral
indifference, but the social position of academic is not one for
advancing political views because we cannot choose rationally between
values: that choice is "a matter of faith" rather than empirical fact.45
The Weberian [concept of **value neutrality**]{.underline} refers to
[academics' responsibility to **keep the**]{.underline} scientific
[**discussion of facts separate** from the **evaluation of them**,
having accepted that the choice of what to study is
value-driven.]{.underline} [The **task of an academic**]{.underline}, in
this view, [is to **engage in technical criticism** and **value
clarification**]{.underline}.46 [This serves to **identify the
repercussions of particular courses of action** and the **value schema
that motivate them**, but **refrains from commenting** on the **validity
of those values**]{.underline}. [A second option is to **engage
explicitly** as an **activist academic**, **making clear what one's
political commitments are** and **actively choosing
sides**]{.underline}.47 In this scenario, [academics **explicitly choose
to research instances** or **structures of social
injustice**]{.underline}, often [conduct research **with** rather than
**on** particular subjects, and use their research to **inform
campaigning** and **protest**. This is neither necessarily biased
research nor the production of propaganda]{.underline} (although of
course, like any research, it can be). [The activist academic is
**explicit** about the values motivating]{.underline} her/his [research
-- and]{.underline} as argued earlier, [value choice is **intrinsic to
all research**, whether it is acknowledged or not -- and seeks to
**connect academic practice to activism**, **learning from** and
**contributing to activist struggles**. Engaging with campaigners and
social movements has the **dual effect** of **putting more pressure on
government to change its policies** and **contributing to**]{.underline}
the **[wider]{.underline}** democratisation of [**social life** through
the **sharing of skills** and **knowledge** among activists and
academics. Both]{.underline} Weberian and activist [strategies share an
acceptance of the political nature of all research]{.underline}, and
that there is no view from nowhere, [but the latter strategy **actively
tries to use research to challenge oppression**. Those following a
Weberian strategy **may well undertake research** that is **critical of
the status quo**, but they **do not explicitly ally themselves** with
what they believe to be **progressive social forces**]{.underline}. My
own understanding of activist academic research retains a belief that
**[scholarship is]{.underline}** a **[different]{.underline}** social
activity [**from campaigning**. While both are **politically situated**
and **motivated**, the **primary aim of campaigning** is to **generate
change**, while the **primary aim of scholarship** is to **generate
truth** (which can only ever be **situated** and **partial**), a process
in which scholars have a duty to **deal explicitly** with
'**inconvenient**' facts]{.underline}.48 However, [scholarship and
campaigning can be **mutually reinforcing**, through a process of
**translation** "that allows for **mutual intelligibility** among the
experiences of the world" that aims to "**identify** and **reinforce
what is common** in the **diversity of counter-hegemonic
drive**."]{.underline}49 [One of the challenges for activist academics
is **traversing the boundaries** between academia and
activism]{.underline}.50 For academics of this persuasion, [the task is
to ensure that there is "neither **too much reflection on too little
experience**, which is **armchair theorizing**, nor **too little
reflection on too much experience**, which is **mere
activism**."]{.underline}51 Of course, there are risks associated with
activist research, including the loss of access to the very institutions
and actors that need to be examined, because of one's reputation as an
activist or lack of contacts within elite circles. This poses difficult
questions for activist researchers and can be a disciplining process,
requiring them to weigh up the benefits to be gained from contributing
to social struggle against their role as a scholar in exploring the
social world. Given that **[activist]{.underline}** academics'
contribution to social struggle is based on their
**[scholarship]{.underline}**, this is a significant risk. As a brief
illustration of how academic strategies play out in practice, my own
research explores non-governmental organisation (NGO) activity in
relation to UK involvement **[in]{.underline}** the **[arms
trade]{.underline}** through the lens of **[debates]{.underline}** about
global civil society.52 It **[assesses the]{.underline}** government's
**[stated policy against its]{.underline}** export [**practice**,
introducing "**inconvenient facts**" regarding the **relationship
between arms capital** and the]{.underline} UK [**state** and **role of
coercion** in the development of capitalism. The leap to an **explicitly
activist agenda** comes through **engagement** with the issue of
**change in**]{.underline} UK **[arms]{.underline}** export
**[policy]{.underline}** and my involvement with anti-arms trade
campaigners. I am indebted to campaigners and NGO workers, many of whom
have conducted painstaking research into the arms trade and its effects.
[On the basis of]{.underline} the **[research]{.underline}** I have done
-- **[using scholarly methods]{.underline}** such as documentary
analysis and interviews53 -- [I am in a position to **contribute to
activist debates** and **strategy**]{.underline}, which I have done
predominantly through involvement with CAAT at the local and national
level. A second aspect of my research explores the widespread image of
NGOs and campaign groups as progressive agents of global civil society.
I am interested interrogating the dominant liberal narratives of a
globalising emancipatory and non-violent sphere separate from the state
and market, and NGO activity on the UK arms trade is a rich case study
for this. This research has implications for campaigning but may not be
directly relevant for it. [I **do not conduct my research for arms
campaigners** but I **contribute where I can**; my research agenda is
**not defined by what is campaignable**. This is in line
with]{.underline} my understanding of [scholarship and campaigning as
**distinct social activities**]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Fairness Bad

#### Calls for fairness and predictability are violent -- our educational model of unruly learning is a better starting point 

**Patel, 16** -- Leigh, Professor in the School of Education at Boston
College. "Pedagogies of Resistance and Survivance: Learning as
Marronage," Equity & Excellence in Education, 49:4, 397-401, p. Project
Muse -- iowa

For anyone who is fascinated by the mystifying and quixotic nature of
learning, places of formal schooling present an almost constant mixture
of promise and heartbreak. Because schooling is undeniably a site of
social reproduction and socialization, it is not a consistent site of
learning. [Learning involves departing from known automatic practices,
venturing into experiences that **aren't wholly predictable**, and
experiencing temporary, productive failure. The goal of social
stratification is incommensurate with the unpredictable and
transformative reality of learning. This disjoint between schooling and
learning echoes into gaps in scholarship about education. In educational
research, raising achievement is so ubiquitous a phrase that it is
largely taken to be synonymous with learning, but these are far from the
same phenomena. Sociologists of education focus routinely on the impact
of education on **society** and on individuals' **life pathways** but
are mostly silent on the affordances of **learning for life and
well-being**]{.underline}. Arguably, it is not the aim of sociology to
theorize learning alongside its core work of mapping access to
educational success, nor is it the traditional focus of teacher
educators, as a significant portion of educational researchers, to
adjudicate income levels and neighborhood impacts on student learning.
[The collateral damage from these areas of disconnect accumulate along
fault lines for understanding the transformative, fugitive nature of
learning as well as for apprehending the raw sorting function of
schooling in society.]{.underline} For example, when we fail to
disambiguate learning from schooling, it becomes possible for pithy
bumper sticker mottos of education (such as "turning on light bulbs") to
stand in the place of rigorous, contested ideations of learning. [The
**conflation of learning with schooling** explains, in part, how
schooling is consistently a site for the creation of **excess Black and
Brown bodies**]{.underline} (Sojoyner, 2013; White, 2016) [**and far
less frequently a place for transformation**. The conflation of learning
with education also partially explains how educational politicians have
come to lead districts, nonprofit educational agencies, and schools of
teacher education without having ever taught a day in the classroom
themselves. When we can't tell the difference between achievement and
learning, business models easily supplant instructional leadership.
Unseemly realities of containment and profit are confronted less
explicitly because they are accepted obliquely under the umbrella of
schooling and are wrongly associated with learning. Yet, examples of the
uncomfortable, risky, and core life practice of learning are everywhere.
They are particularly pungent and poignant within oppressive societies.
Learning is, at its core, a fundamentally fugitive act, underscored with
deeper fugitivity in societies where the dangerous, agentic act of
learning is constricted with punishing precision. Learning as fugitivity
exists as dialectic to the stratifying cultures of formal education that
insist on contingent possibilities for well-being for some and
unmitigated safety for others]{.underline}. The oft-noted achievement
gap displays these contingent relationships. Against this backdrop of
stratified life, learning exists in direct defiance of the rhetoric of
achievement. It is around us and part of many of our histories, as are
requisite histories of access to and foreclosure from school-based
achievement. A significant challenge for educators and educational
research is actually seeing the fugitive acts of learning and being able
to differentiate those moments of unruly rupture from the seductive
mollification of school-based achievement. [Ascertaining the fugitive
acts of learning as they occur, this edited issue of Equity & Excellence
in Education speaks out loud and theorize how learning is often a place
of resistance and in that resisting, a place of survivance]{.underline}
(Vizenor, 1999). I was raised by parents who had radically different
relationships with school and learning. My father migrated to the United
States from South Asia in 1958, with a bachelor's degree in hand, to
pursue his masters' degree in chemical engineering. For the first part
of his professional life, he did as formal education wants one to do and
regularly bellows as its province: He ascended. He connected to other
professionals through the social networks established in graduate school
and company affiliations, he studied the vocabularies and practices of
people in higher stations, and he attempted to approximate those
positions, in part, through his use of cultural referents and turns of
phrase. He was an excellent student in school and applied those same
skills of acquisition of knowledge when learning the culture of
corporate America in the early 1960s. However, instead of upward
mobility, failure became the turgid feature of his professional life.
After a certain point of attainment, contingencies, collateral damage,
and descent marked his career. His ability to apply the many lessons
learned while a student bore little fruit societally, and little came to
supplant it. My mother did not attend school beyond third grade in her
town of Gujurat because there is little reason to formally educate girls
when their predetermined roles were to be wife, mother, and household
runner. If anything, formal education gets in the way of those roles. My
mother came to the U.S. without knowing any of the alphabet used here,
let alone the sounds and the associative meanings of words. She taught
herself the language and culture, as many migrant women do, by watching
daytime soap operas and venturing out further and further into this
strange new world. She did so, in part, because she had to but also
because she has always embodied a learning spirit, which is to say, a
restless and often painfully transforming spirit. The learning she was
forced to engage in, as well as the learning she chose for herself,
fundamentally changed her. Learning standardized academic English and
the craft of sewing indelibly transformed her. The latter would help
support the household after my father's career came to its demise. Her
world shifted, and she, accordingly, had to become a different self in
relation to this transformed world. This involved learning, leaving what
she had known and who she had been. In short, it involved fleeing.
Although depicted overly neatly here, my parents' stories present two
sides of a deeply schizophrenic coin that learning and education have
come to occupy in societies that stratify well-being for some and risk
for others. These two narratives only provide a glimpse into the much
longer, much more com- plicated history of contingent relationships with
citizenship, Whiteness, and class found in migration histories from
South Asia to North America. A longer historical understanding of South
Asians in the United States would include the ways that working class
South Asians migrated to the United States in the early twentieth
century, taking up camaraderie and even collective political organizing
within Mex- ican and Black communities (Bald, 2013). When migration laws
changed to seek, reward, and protect professional classes, specifically
engineers, the composition of South Asians in the U.S. shifted to popu-
lations like the Patel clan of Gujarat, a population that is now seeking
governmental protected status in India. In 1910, South Asians were
unequivocally prohibited from the category of Whiteness in the United
States. A century later, they have been put in proximity to Whiteness,
largely through formal education, and this proximity helps to fuel
anti-Black model minority myths. This shift in social station contains
lessons about the unanticipated wounds inflicted on learning when
societal station and the drive for even higher station supplant
community and transformation. In the settler colony structure of the
United States, [formal education is invoked, with overbearing frequency,
as the arbiter of social mobility. This hologram of education is deeply
connected to, if not sourced directly from, the national narratives of
meritocracy, social advancement, and more fundamentally, progress and
discovery. As a settler colony, ideas of progress signal a state,
meaning both a condition of and government, of exceptionality. Being
exceptional works to justify and historicize the ongoing racialized
societal structure of land theft, human subjugation, and wealth
accumulation.]{.underline} From my father's vantage point, when the
processes that he learned in school, to study and reproduce practices,
did not result in either durable wealth accumulation or comfortable
professional intimacy with those who held that wealth and position, the
world turned out to be a rather sour place. He himself soured at not
being able to access this allure of exceptionality. This is a familiar
story for many who have bought into the structural promise of formal
education only to have it withheld due to the more fundamental structure
of racist capitalism, which desperately needs stratified well-being and
suffering. In fact, a cursory grasp of the generational hold of
vulnerable social status should cast a skeptical shadow on the rhetoric
of oppor- tunity and achievement. Societal, generational vulnerability
is experienced through upheaval and threat of upheaval in housing
(Delmont, 2016), incarceration (Alexander, 2012), school closure and
overhaul (Buras, 2011), casualization of labor, and proliferation of
privatization in myriad sectors of societies. All of these vectors exist
in a racial capitalist global order (Da Silva, 2007; Du Bois & Edwards,
2008) that emphatically denies racial logics despite glaring realities.
A thirst for an impossible state of Whiteness was certainly the most
salient ingredient in my father's desire for and obstruction from
societal status. [Situating his relationship with formal education and
the accompanying racial capitalist societal structure shows how
threadbare the settler narratives of linearity, progress, and mobility
are when juxtaposed against the reality of institutionalized
racism]{.underline}. Even though he held power as a man in a patriarchal
order, he was still a Brown man, a small Brown man among large White men
and, larger still, Whiteness. Although the narrative of upward mobility
is one of linear progress and fairness, the direct function between
formal education and societal safety is subterfuge. My mother's
interaction with learning was embodied more by chaos than neat, linear
progression from one station in life to the next. But different from the
bankrupt promise of social mobility for those who perform well in
school, her narrative displays lessons about the fundamentally fugitive
nature of learning. As she learned a new language and taught herself a
trade by reading and closely observing and experimenting, she changed,
in essence, who she was. These transformations of self were mostly
self-initiated but that did not mean they were easy. She sought new
knowledge, and sometimes resisted it, as many do, because she inveighed
that new ideas, new ways of being in the world, are nothing less than
disruptive. Yet her conditions and her spirit demanded disruption after
disruption. As my father's relationship with work and his ability to
earn an income destabilized, what she had been taught to do societally,
which was cook, care for, and be subservient to her husband, would not
have sustained the home. Her experiences of learning were made necessary
and departed from the socialization she had experienced. When my mother
began to learn t'ai chi in her 70s, it marked, truly, the first practice
that she had ever engaged exclusively for her own edification. It did
not result in monetary sustenance, as had learning the craft of sewing
decades earlier. It did not mean a more easy household maintenance, as
learning various changing technologies throughout the decades had. It
did not mean basic survival, as learning English had meant as the only
Gujurati-speaking woman in her first American locale of Indianapolis in
1960. Learning t'ai chi meant no less than learning how to position
herself first, which involved rupturing decades of training to second
herself. It was unruly, and in the wake of beginning this practice, my
mother experienced surface-level depression and frustration for the
first time in her life. Prioritizing t'ai chi for herself meant,
prioritizing herself in essence, unpredictably; she also opened herself
up to an emotional terrain that had been present before but bracketed to
a side station. She asked for none of that emotional experience when she
began t'ai chi and was unsettled by it. It was a powerful but not
necessarily pretty picture. [**Learning, as it turns out, involves
unpredictability**. Its consequences are often unruly in their
unwillingness to be contained]{.underline}. Chaos, then, was certainly a
feature of my parents' learning. The chaos in my father's life
ultimately soured his relationship with formal education and the
different chaos in my mother's relationship to herself and the world
through learning throw into sharp relief how far apart for- mal
education is from learning. Formal education demands mastery for the
promised purpose of success, but more regularly delivers on the implicit
purpose of stratification. Learning demands a transformation of oneself
for impacts and consequences that are fundamentally unpredictable. [One
of the key functions that education performs in hierarchical societies
is sorting people into their respective societal positions: owner,
laborer, manager. In a settler colonial structure, though, education
must also do **the** additional **unseemly work of justifying** or
blurring **societal structures** through narratives of societal promise,
constant opportunity, and self-rationalizing myths of meritocracy. These
are the narratives that mark the place of formal education in the United
States. They **are as vital as oxygen to** the **violent structures** of
land seizure **and attempts to** erase Indigeneity and **reduce
Blackness to chattel**. Settler colonialism, with its architecture of
racist capitalism, relies on narratives that blur its purposeful
inequitable violence. Unfortunately, education's capitulation to the
settler **narratives of progress**, upward mobility, and exceptionalism
have deterred it from protecting spaces for **unruly, transformative
learning**.]{.underline} [Education is in woeful need of robust theories
of learning. Only in a field that has obliquely refused to examine how
extensively it contributes to societal disadvantage can those cast on
the underside of humanity]{.underline} (Wynter, 2003) [be told that they
merely need to be grittier or have a growth mindset. Concomi- tant to
these shallow understandings of societal structures are flimsy theories
of learning that conflate learning and pedagogy]{.underline} for test
score production. [Astoundingly, education pursues the elimination of
the racial achievement gap as if it can do so disconnected from its own
production of this gap or from its deep connection to the fields of
incarceration, housing, employment, and health that all manifest strati-
fied realities of population-level harm]{.underline}. This myopia is
replete in the racist capitalist society of the United States. Racism
continues to be ideated as individually perpetuated, and this protected
misunderstanding permeates societal institutions, particularly applied
fields like education. [Learning and life, though, cannot be contained
by such structures. Preceding and within various forms of colonialism,
learning has found side streets to skirt the four-lane
government-sanctioned highways. While enslaved peoples were banned from
becoming literate]{.underline} (Monaghan, 1998) [in the U.S., literal
underground libraries and schoolrooms were created]{.underline}. Marron
enclaves in Jamaica would sequester a few workers at a time to engage in
rest and political education, creating an undercommons (Harney & Moten,
2013) rumbling under the structure of plantation life. Assata Shakur's
biography mimics the partial tales relayed in slave narratives. These
tellings invoke lessons but keep lots of details loose in order to
protect the fugitive spirit of the ideas (Hames-Garcia, 2004). Across
all of these example, the points of departure, of flight, are in
dialectic relationship to power structures that seek to disallow such
flight. Learning is transformational, but it also becomes distinctly
fugitive when attempted to be squelched. Learning under racist
capitalism as acts of marronage Political scientist and historian Neil
Roberts (2015) posits that [the dialectics of slavery and freedom are
under-theorized to address oppressive societies and associative,
unpredictable marron practices. Marronage is a **practice** of freedom
that **must, necessarily, start from the condition and category of
enslavement in order to transgress** it. Working through connective
conceptualizations of enslavement, disavowal, freedom, and agency,
Roberts argues that historical and theoretical nuance has been absent in
theorizing freedom as marronage from slavery. The repetitive flight for
sovereignty must be considered, even if it is squelched repeatedly, in
the cumulative. It is in the cumulative that its relentless expression
of freedom can be viewed. "The actions, beliefs, and ideals of slave
masses, good and bad, are, in a repeating circular logic, habitually
ignored. We must remove the epistemological cataract]{.underline}"
(Roberts, 2015, p. 115) [that obscures the fugitive logic within and
across these evasions. Pedagogical practices of resistance and
survivance must, similarly, be apprehended, set still temporarily in
order to be viewed, in their dialectical relationship to formal,
oppressive structures of schooling]{.underline}. Learning that seeks to
find a side street from the test score production factory mill of
schooling does so in dialectical relationship to the factory. [It
sources, temporarily and liminally, its sense of being in relation to
the oppressive stratifying structures of formal education]{.underline}.
Learning as resistance within a context that creates and contains Black
and Brown student bodies and accumulates property rights for a few,
cannot be sufficiently described without addressing the intermittent
departures from those structures. [Neither can the structures of
oppression be adequately understood without pedagogical practices of
resistance. Education has always had the potential to serve and shield
spaces of unruly learning. Perhaps **a first step** into this potential
is seeing more clearly the **fugitive acts of learning** as they occur
within oppressive structures.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Assimilation

#### Framework is colonial assimilation -- it builds a communities by paving over difference. Vote aff for pluralism. 

**Berman 13** \[Paul Schiff, George Washington University Law School,
"Jurisgenerative Constitutionalism: Procedural Principles for Managing
Global Legal Pluralism," pp. 671-5,
<https://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2228&context=faculty_publications>\]

SELF, OTHER, AND THE NEGOTIATION OF DIFFERENCE [How do we encounter the
Other? How do we experience those who are different?]{.underline} Can we
communicate? Can we live in parallel? Can we learn from those who are
different? Can we ignore them? How do we manage the inevitable jostling
that may arise? These are questions that are simultaneously
psychological, sociological, political, and legal and, therefore, should
be addressed on many different levels at once. [One possible response to
the encounter with the Other is to focus on those attributes that make
the Other not so different at all. This is the "we're all fundamentally
the same" gambit we hear so often.]{.underline} And, interestingly,
[this focus on sameness can be adopted both by die-hard
nationalists---who use it to insist that "our" norms]{.underline}
(whoever the "our" might be) [should govern all]{.underline}---[and
committed universalists, who use it to push for uniform norms operating
cross-culturally throughout space and time.]{.underline} In this same
vein, some sociological studies of communication start from the idea
that interpersonal interaction requires both parties in an encounter to
believe (or at least assume) that the other is not truly other at all.17
According to this view, most associated with Alfred Schutz,18
differences in individual perspectives are overcome only if each party
tacitly believes that he or she could effectively trade places with the
other. As Schutz describes it, "I am able to understand other people's
acts only if I can imagine that I myself would perform analogous acts if
I were in the same situation."19 [Thus, differences in perspective are
reduced to differences in situation. Any, possibly more fundamental,
**differences are suppressed to facilitate dialogue.** As a result, the
deliberate assuming away of the unfamiliar is seen as a constant part of
everyday life. The unfamiliar is relegated to the category of "strange,"
and "strangeness" necessarily is placed elsewhere, somewhere other than
the interaction at hand.]{.underline}20 Moreover, Harold Garfinkel and
other ethnomethodologists have argued that individuals do not simply
passively maintain these assumptions but are constantly engaged in a
joint enterprise aimed at sustaining this familiarity.21 In all of these
studies, [the emphasis is on "the human production of common worlds of
meaning as the only axis on which dialogue rotates."]{.underline}22 But
is that all there is to the experience of the Other? Is it really
imperative constantly to assume that our fellow human beings are
fundamentally identical to us? After all, **["\[u\]nder this principle,
if a dialogue is to take place, strangeness as a phenomenon of everyday
interaction must be considered negatively, namely, as that part of an
encounter that must be constantly 'assumed away' by the
participants."]{.underline}**23 Thus, we are left with a world in which
people are classified either as familiar or as strangers. [Even more
problematic, these studies suggest that it will be simply impossible to
bridge the communication gap with those deemed strangers.]{.underline}
Yet, as Georg Simmel noted long ago, the stranger is never truly
distant,24 so there will need to be some way of bridging gaps short of
assuming away strangeness altogether. On the other hand, [we might
respond to such encounters with the Other by retreating to **a gated
community** and trying to **lead a hermetically-sealed existence**.
Here, the Other remains fully Other, and no communication is
possible.]{.underline} Both of **[these responses, when translated to
law, are fundamentally jurispathic. They kill off competing
interpretations by authoritatively saying that this is the law and that
is not.]{.underline}** So, either a single nation-state's norms govern
or one universal law governs. [Such jurispathic legal
assertions]{.underline} may sometimes be effective, necessary, or
desirable, but they [are not the only ways to structure legal relations
among multiple communities. Indeed, they both represent a fundamental
retreat from hybridity.]{.underline} Yet, hybridity is difficult to
escape in a world of overlapping jurisdictions and normative diversity,
where--- as the pluralists would say---multiple conflicting legal
systems occupy the same social field. The question therefore often
becomes: are there other approaches to managing pluralism? Can we come
up with a more pluralist constitutional order? What are the
constitutional principles we might apply? Unlike the universalist
approach, [a pluralist vision does not require people to be
conceptualized as fundamentally identical]{.underline} in order to be
brought within the same normative system. Nor does a pluralist vision
render outsiders irrelevant, [as sovereignist territorialism does.
Instead,]{.underline} pluralism attempts to navigate a different path
altogether. [A pluralist constitutional frame asks whether we can seek
solutions without assuming commonality or]{.underline} seek
harmonization [while preserving the insistence on difference that
contextualists rightly emphasize.]{.underline} In short, pluralism
questions whether we are doomed either to require commonality or to
essentialize difference. Are those truly the only possible approaches?
Think again of how we encounter a stranger. Do we necessarily see that
stranger as fundamentally the same as we are or fundamentally different?
Might not we see (and celebrate) important differences while seeking
ways to bridge those gaps so that we might communicate with each other
and live peaceably side by side? [Perhaps we might draw from Hannah
Arendt, who offers a different way of conceptualizing the encounter with
the stranger. Instead of assuming commonality, she seeks]{.underline},
in Understanding and Politics, [the quality that "makes it bearable for
us to live with other people, strangers forever, in the same world, and
makes it possible for them to bear with us.]{.underline}"25 Note that
for Arendt, the task is how to "bear with" strangers, even while
recognizing that they will forever be strange.26 [Arendt's strategy for
bearing with strangers is more than just mutual indifference and more
than just toleration as well.]{.underline} It "involves a mental
capacity appropriate for an active relation to that which is distant,"27
which Arendt locates in King Solomon's gift of the "understanding
heart."28 Understanding, according to Arendt, "is the specifically human
way of being alive; for every single person needs to be reconciled to a
world into which he was born a stranger and in which, to the extent of
his distinct uniqueness, he always remains a stranger."29 What does
"understanding" entail for Arendt? This is a bit difficult to pin down,
but she makes clear that understanding is not gained through direct
experience of the Other, and it is not just knowledge of the other.30
Instead, understanding starts from the individual situated apart from
others. Thus, instead of "feeling your pain," understanding involves
determining what aspects of the pain people feel have to do with
politics and what politics can do to resolve our common dilemmas.
Moreover, "\[u\]nderstanding can be challenged and is compelled to
respond to an alternative argument or interpretation."31 In short,
understanding in Arendt's formulation looks a lot less like empathy and
a lot more like judging.32 While assuming sameness leads to a
universalist harmonization approach, Arendt's more distanced conception
of the encounter with the stranger is akin to the pluralist vision I am
pursuing as an alternative. Likewise, consider Iris Marion Young's idea
of "unassimilated otherness," which she posits as the relation among
people in the ideal "unoppressive city."33 Young envisions ideal city
life as the "'being-together' of strangers."34 These strangers may
remain strangers and continue to "experience each other as other."35
Indeed, they do not necessarily seek an overall group identification and
loyalty. Yet, **[they are open to "unassimilated
otherness."]{.underline}**36 [They belong to various distinct groups or
cultures and are constantly interacting with other groups. But, they do
so without seeking either to assimilate or to reject those others. Such
interactions instantiate an alternative kind of
community,]{.underline}37 [one that is never a hegemonic imposition of
sameness but that nevertheless prevents different groups from ever being
completely outside one another.]{.underline}38 In a city's public
spaces, Young argues, we see glimpses of this ideal: "The city consists
in a great diversity of people and groups, with a multitude of
subcultures and differentiated activities and functions, whose lives and
movements mingle and overlap in public spaces."39 In this vision, there
can be community without sameness, shifting affiliations without
ostracism.

two sides have been unable to reach a deal because the high-mobility
artillery rocket system (HIMARS) could be too expensive for Manila given
its tight defence budget, they said. The [allies' defence chiefs,
however, **reaffirmed their "enduring alliance"**]{.underline} on Monday
in Washington, [and agreed to **increase the interoperability** of their

State Mike Pompeo's mutual defence reassurance in Manila last month,
when Pompeo singled out the threat of "China's island-building and
military activities" in the disputed waterway. If deployed, [the
long-range, precision-guided rockets fired by the system would be able
to strike Chinese man-made islands on reefs in the Spratly
chain]{.underline}, one expert said. The revelation came after an
influential defence think tank, the Centre for a New American Security
(CNAS) in Washington, warned in a new report that the US' "freedom of
navigation" operations had failed to fundamentally alter Beijing's
course in the South China Sea. Beijing has reportedly installed
anti-ship and surface-to-air missile systems on three artificial islands
on Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief reefs in the Spratly chain, posing a
potential hurdle to US military access in the contested area. It
rejected a US demand that the missiles be removed during high-level
diplomatic and security talks in Washington in November. 'Time for

The think tank's report released on March 21 urged [the US to deploy
HIMARS in Southeast Asian countries, which will "**demonstrate the
flexibility and variability of America's rotational military
presence".** The rocket system was first test-fired in the
US-Philippines annual military drill]{.underline}, Balikatan, in 2016.
The Pentagon's director of the joint staff, Lieutenant General Kenneth
McKenzie, has warned that the US has the ability to "take down" China's
artificial islands. Chinese military experts had a mixed response, with
one dismissing the possibility of a HIMARS The US Army Pacific, which
operates HIMARS in the region, has not publicly singled out the system
from a set of options that could be used in a conflict in the South
China Sea. General James McConville, the US Army's vice chief of staff,
indicated last month that no imminent deployment of "long-range
precision fires" was in the pipeline but partner nations in the Pacific
"are open to the discussion", according to a report by Stars and
Stripes. Derrick Cheng, a US Army Pacific spokesman, declined to comment
on the details of any "operations or activities related to any future
deployment of US Army soldiers or equipment". "For US Army Pacific, the
M142 HIMARS is a capability within our organisation, specifically the
17th Field Artillery Brigade that we train and use to maintain our
overall war-fighting readiness," Cheng said. "The brigade and its role
as a multi-domain task force is part of our effort to integrate
capabilities and evolve the concept of multi-domain operations." [HIMARS
is a light multiple rocket launcher, mounted on a US Army truck, that
can launch six rounds of rockets, or one surface-to-surface tactical

The Trump administration has made a number of strong statements about
the need for the United States to do more to prepare for great power
competition with China. Officials have effectively set the stage for
[2019 as a year in which **critical progress must occur** with regard to
implementing posture, budgets, and policies that counter Chinese efforts
to displace the United States in the Western Pacific.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, [the scope and scale of Chinese efforts over the past 25
**years diminished America's influence in Asia, particularly its role in
Southeast Asia**]{.underline}, in such a way that current U.S. actions
must have a sense of urgency if they are to succeed. The 2018 National
Defense Strategy clearly articulated the top priority the Trump
administration placed on handling the challenges mounted by near-peer
competitors. The budget deal agreed to last March reset the baseline for
defense funding at 3.5 percent of GDP and provided two years of
significantly increased funding over Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 levels. These
efforts, along with other trade and policy actions by the Trump
administration in 2018 and 2019, reflected a [renewed concern for the
economic and security threat China presents to the United States and its
allies in the Asia-Pacific.]{.underline} Recently, the Department of
Defense released its new Indo-Pacific Strategy Report. The document
represents an excellent discussion of the challenges the Pentagon faces
and a cross-referencing of the ongoing procurement and posture changes
in the works to address them. However, it does not fundamentally address
the core operational issues the U.S. military faces, nor explain how it
could reduce the risk in an acceptable time frame. [The Defense
Department and the administration should be proposing actions to
demonstrate that the United States is committed to countering the threat
posed by China in the Asia-Pacific and is willing to realign its force
posture and service budgets]{.underline} to achieve this strategic
objective. These [posture actions will emphasize **U.S. efforts to both
assure allies and partners and deter Chinese behavior in Southeast Asia;
a**nd, should deterrence fail, these actions **will enhance America's
ability to rapidly defeat any Chinese provocations that occur.** The
United States is experiencing the impact of China's successful 25-year
effort]{.underline}, initiated after the Taiwan Straits crisis of the
mid-1990s, to design and build a military capability and capacity that
specifically targets U.S. air and maritime forces[. This Chinese
procurement effort aimed to exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. forces and
mitigate risk from known U.S. strengths.]{.underline} Investments of
greatest concern to U.S. war planners include the anti-ship ballistic
missile threats to U.S. aircraft carriers, anti-ship cruise missile
threats to U.S. surface ships, and both ground and air launched cruise
missile and ballistic missile threats to U.S. and allied air bases and
fixed logistics sites. In addition to these long-range missile
developments, China's success in both modernizing and growing capacity
in destroyers, long-range bombers, submarines, air defense and
electronic warfare systems, and long-range surveillance and targeting
capabilities also reduce or eliminate U.S. advantages. These Chinese
systems place America's most important military forces, which constitute
much of the "contact" and "blunt" layers of the Trump administration's
defense ambitions, at significant risk[. This reality makes it appear to
U.S. allies and partners that **Beijing could successfully seek a fait
accompli by launching a quick, sharp conflict.**]{.underline} This
dangerous perception makes it all the more critical that the United
States move rapidly to close the operational gap with China. Rebalancing
Without Closing the Gap Beginning in the 1970s, for various political
and diplomatic reasons **[the U.S. posture in the region was slowly
shifted out of bases in South Vietnam (1973), Taiwan (1979), and the
Philippines (1991]{.underline}**) and consolidated in Northeast Asia
(Japan and Korea) where the majority of U.S. forces have been since the
1990s. For the first two decades of China's modernization effort (1994
to 2012), U.S. force posture in Asia remained largely stagnant, if not
regressive. The wars in the Middle East and a belief that Chinese
economic integration into the global system would lead to a softening in
China's security posture encouraged a lack of U.S. investment.

documents[. The South China Sea **(SCS) issue** undoubtedly attracted
attention and the consensus reached and messages sent will **impact
their** relevant maritime **relations for the foreseeable future**. The
tone of bilateral relations set by the two heads of states give guidance
for the relevant agencies in both countries to handle their SCS disputes
in an amicable and cooperative way. President Xi stated during his visit
that the goal of the trip was to elevate friendship and cooperation
between the two countries.]{.underline} The consensus to further promote
good relations is stated in the Joint Statement issued at the end of
President Xi's visit[. Both sides recognized that **a "sound" bilateral
relationship** **contributes to "the fundamental interests** of the two
peoples".]{.underline} After two years of effort since President Rodrigo
Duterte took office in 2016[**, China-Philippines relations** have
achieved a **positive turnaround and a sound development
momentum.**]{.underline} [China is now the Philippines' largest trading
partner, largest export market, and largest source of imports, and the
second largest source of tourists.]{.underline} However, intensified
efforts are required to accomplish meaningful gains from cooperation
agreements. As President Xi noted, [the fact **that China and the
Philippines face similar developmental challenges has made the two
countries "natural partners with a common destiny." The SCS dispute is
one of the key issues which could impact bilateral relations
significantly**]{.underline}. The 2016 SCS arbitration case which the
former Aquino III administration invoked against China dragged
China-Philippine relations to their lowest level. Though China believed
that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction and declared it not to accept the
award[, **the case continues to overshadow bilateral
relations**]{.underline}. It was expected that Xi would clarify China's
stand on the issue to the Filipino people during the visit. The day
before his trip to the Philippines, three Philippine newspapers
published President Xi's article entitled "Jointly Explore New Future
for China-Philippine Relations". In regard to the SCS, Xi wrote,
relevant differences between the two countries need to be properly
handled through friendly consultations, at the same time both countries
need to enhance dialogue and co-operation on maritime issues in order to
make the South China Sea a region of peace, friendship and co-operation
to benefit the peoples of both countries. As neighboring countries in
Asia, Xi further expounded, [**China will work together with the
Philippines to build upon the Asian tradition of peace**, credibility,
and good neighborliness, and to further consolidate bilateral relations
for a brighter future. The SCS has become the thorny issue in
China-Philippine relations since the 1980s. Furthermore, rather than
resolve the problem, the 2016 arbitration case overshadowed relations.
Xi's visit leaves opportunities for China and the Philippines to explore
and elevate their SCS relations. **Management of SCS relations is still
the ke**y]{.underline}. At the top leadership level, visits and
communication are important to set the tone for better management of
relevant issues. At the working level, efforts by all the mechanisms
listed in Point 5, in particular the BCM and MCJC over the sea issues
should also be intensified to promote understanding, timely response to
problems, and explore areas of co-operation. The possibility of
practical co-operation over marine resource development should also be
explored, but a cautious step-by-step approach is to be taken, starting
with less contentious issues and less sensitive geographic areas to
build up confidence.

#### No SCS War -- Lack of capabilities, funding, and fear of Chinese response make it unlikely

**Peck 5/18** (Michael, contributing writer for the National Interest,

South China Sea,\" National Interest,

However, [funding from the cash-strapped Philippines is a
hurdle.]{.underline} "The two sides have been unable to reach a deal
because [HIMARS could be too expensive for Manila given its tight
defense budget]{.underline}," said the newspaper. Exactly how much does
HIMARS cost? Manufacturer Lockheed Martin refused to give cost
estimates, instead referring queries to the U.S. Army's Aviation and
Missile Command, which didn't respond to questions from TNI[. The cost
of HIMARS is split between the launcher itself and separate contracts
for various munitions including guided and unguided
rockets]{.underline}, the longer-range Army Tactical Missile System
(ATACMS) missiles, and weapons under development such as extended-range
rockets and the Precision Strike Missile. Some estimates put the cost of
a HIMARS guided rocket at \$100,000 to \$200,000 apiece, or an ATACMS at
more than \$700,000 apiece. Another clue is that Poland recently signed
a \$414 million contract for eighteen launchers plus support and
training. With the 2019 Philippines defense budget at only \$3.4
billion, a big HIMARS purchase would be a strain. Yet HIMARS is still a
cheaper option than, say, a \$1.4 million Tomahawk cruise missile. And
the Philippines had already had a taste of HIMARS. The weapon was
deployed there by U.S. Marines in 2016 during the joint U.S.-Philippines
Balikatan exercises. Collin Koh Swee Lean, a Singaporean defense
analyst, told the South China Morning Post that "[there were two
possible locations for the system: Palawan province in the Philippines
and Thitu, or Zhongye in Chinese]{.underline}---the largest island held
by Manila in the disputed Spratly chain. From Palawan, HIMARS could
launch a missile at its maximum range to hit China's man-made island at
Mischief Reef, Koh said. But Th[itu island would also be vulnerable to
PLA air and missile strikes because it is only about 22 kilometers (14
miles) from China-occupied Subi Reef, and within striking range of
missiles originating from the Paracel Islands and Hainan]{.underline}."
The cheaper price tag of HIMARS compared to other weapons does make it
attractive. "The idea of purchasing HIMARS systems may be one of the few
viable options in response to China\'s artificial islands and continuing
and increasingly provocative actions in the SCS \[South China Sea\],"
says Jay [Batongbacal, director of the Philippines-based Institute for
Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea.]{.underline} Yet Batongbacal [does
not see a sale any time soon]{.underline}. "The [Philippines is probably
not yet in a position to make a purchase,]{.underline}" he told The
National Interest. "[It is also not likely to arm its own possessions
significantly, for **fear of Chinese reaction**]{.underline}." American
experts agree. "Absent an abrupt change in foreign policy outlook by
President Duterte, [it is unlikely the Philippines would acquire HIMARS
in the near future]{.underline}," says Brian Harding, an Asian security
expert at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International
Studies. "In addition to the price tag, [Duterte would likely find
HIMARS to be too provocative vis-à-vis China.]{.underline}"

<http://thediplomat.com/2015/06/the-us-and-china-wont-see-military-conflict-over-the-south-china-sea/>

In a recent piece on the South China Sea disputes, I argued that "the
ASEAN claimants are largely staying behind the scenes while external
powers take center stage." Based on recent developments on the South
China Sea issue, it seems [[the U.S. will]{.mark} not only [be]{.mark} a
'director' but [an actor.]{.mark} We saw this clearly on May 20, when
[the]{.mark} U.S. [military sent]{.mark} surveillance [aircraft
over]{.mark} three [islands controlled by Beijing.]{.mark}]{.underline}¶
However, [[this does not]{.mark} necessary [mean the S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea [will spark]{.mark} [a]{.mark} U.S.-China
military [conflict]{.mark}.¶]{.underline} [[As a]{.mark} global
[hegemon,]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' main [interest
lies in maintaining the current]{.mark} international [order as well as
peace]{.mark} and stability]{.underline}. Regarding the South China Sea,
U.S. interests include ensuring peace and stability, freedom of
commercial navigation, and military activities in exclusive economic
zones. Maintaining the current balance of power is considered to be a
key condition for securing these interests---and a rising China
determined to strengthen its hold on South China Sea territory is viewed
as a threat to the current balance of power. In response, the U.S.
launched its "rebalance to Asia" strategy. In practice, the U.S. has on
the one hand strengthened its military presence in Asia-Pacific, while
on the other hand supporting ASEAN countries, particularly ASEAN
claimants to South China Sea territories.¶ This position has included
high-profile rhetoric by U.S. officials. In 2010, then-U.S. Secretary of
State Hilary Clinton spoke at the ASEAN Regional Forum in Hanoi about
the South China Sea, remarks that aligned the U.S. with Southeast Asia's
approach to the disputes. At the 2012 Shangri-La Dialogue,
then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained how the United States
will rebalance its force posture as part of playing a "deeper and more
enduring partnership role" in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2014,
then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel called out China's "destabilizing,
unilateral activities asserting its claims in the South China Sea." His
remarks also came at the Shangri-La dialogue, while China's HY-981 oil
rig was deployed in the waters around the Paracel Islands. In 2015, U.S.
officials have openly pressured China to scale back its construction
work in the Spratly islands and have sent aircraft to patrol over
islands in the Spratly that are controlled by China. These measures have
brought global attention to the South China Sea.¶ [However, if we look
at the practical significance of the remarks, there are several limiting
factors. The [interests]{.mark} at stake in the South China Sea ar[e not
core national interests for the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline} [Meanwhile, [the U.S.-Philippine alliance
is not as important as the]{.mark} U.S.-[Japan alliance, and U.S. ties
with other ASEAN countries are even weaker]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
**[Given U.S.-China mutual economic dependence and
China's]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[comprehensive national [strength, the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is unlikely to]{.mark} go so far as
[hav]{.mark}ing [a military confrontation]{.mark} with China over the
South China Sea]{.underline}**. Barack [[Obama]{.mark}, the 'peace
president' who withdrew the U.S. military from Iraq and Afghanistan, [is
even less likely to fight with China]{.mark} for the South China
Sea.¶]{.underline} As for the U.S. interests in the region, [[Washington
is]{.mark} surely [aware]{.mark} that [China has not affected the
freedom of]{.mark} commercial [navigation]{.mark} in these waters so
far]{.underline}. And as I noted in my earlier piece, Beijing is
developing its stance and could eventually recognize the legality of
military activities in another country's EEZ (see, for example, the
China-Russia joint military exercise in the Mediterranean).¶ Yet when it
comes to China's large-scale land reclamation in the Spratly Islands
(and on Woody Island in the Paracel Islands), Washington worries that
Beijing will conduct a series of activities to strengthen its claims on
the South China Sea, such as establishing an air defense identification
zone (ADIZ) or advocating that others respect a 200-nautical mile (370
km) EEZ from its islands. Meanwhile, the 2014 oil rig incident taught
Washington that ASEAN claimants and even ASEAN as a whole could hardly
play any effective role in dealing with China's land reclamation. Hence,
the U.S. has no better choice than to become directly involved in this
issue.¶ At the beginning, the United States tried to stop China through
private diplomatic mediation, yet it soon realized that this approach
was not effective in persuading China. So Washington started to tackle
the issue in a more aggressive way, such as encouraging India, Japan,
ASEAN, the G7, and the European Union to pressure Beijing
internationally. Domestically, U.S. officials from different departments
and different levels have opposed China's 'changing the status quo' in
this area.¶ Since 2015, Washington has increased its pressure on China.
It sent the USS Fort Worth, a littoral combat ship, to sail in waters
near the Spratly area controlled by Vietnam in early May. U.S. official
are also considering sending naval and air patrols within 12 nautical
miles of the Spratly Islands controlled by China.¶ Washington has
recognized that it could hardly stop China's construction in Spratly
Islands. Therefore, it has opted to portray Beijing as a challenger to
the status quo, at the same time moving to prevent China from
establishing a South China Sea ADIZ and an EEZ of 200 nautical miles
around its artificial islands. This was the logic behind the U.S.
sending a P-8A surveillance plane with reporters on board to approach
three artificial island built by China. China issued eight warnings to
the plane; the U.S. responded by saying the plane was flying through
international airspace.¶ Afterwards, U.S. Defense Department spokesman,
Army Col. Steve Warren, said there could be a potential "freedom of
navigation" exercise within 12 nautical miles of the artificial islands.
If this approach were adopted, it would back China into a corner; hence
it's a unlikely the Obama administration will make that move.¶ As the
U.S. involvement in the South China Sea becomes more aggressive and
high-profile, the dynamic relationship between China and the United
States comes to affect other layers of the dispute (for example,
relations between China and ASEAN claimants or China and ASEAN in
general). To some extent, the South China Sea dispute has developed into
a balance of power tug-of-war between the U.S. and China, yet [both
sides will not take the risk of military confrontation]{.underline}.
[[As]{.mark} Foreign Minister Wang [Yi put it]{.mark}]{.underline} in a
recent meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, "as for the
differences, [our attitude is it is okay to have differences as long as
[we]{.mark} could [avoid]{.mark} misunderstanding, and even more
importantly, avoid [miscalc]{.mark}ulation."¶]{.underline} For its part,
China is determined to build artificial islands and several airstrips in
the Spratlys, which I argue would help promote the resolution of SCS
disputes. But it's worth noting that if China establishes an ADIZ and
advocates a 200 nautical miles EEZ (as the U.S. fears), it would push
ASEAN claimants and even non-claimants to stand by the United States.
Obviously, the potential consequences contradict with China's "One Belt,
One Road" strategy.¶ In February 2014, in response to reports by Japan's
Asahi Shimbun that a South China Sea ADIZ was imminent, China's Ministry
of Foreign Affairs hinted that China would not necessarily impose an
ADIZ. "[The Chinese side has yet to feel any air security threat from
the ASEAN countries and is optimistic about its relations with the
neighboring countries and the general situation in the South China Sea
region]{.underline}," a spokesperson said.¶ Since the "Belt and Road" is
Beijing's primary strategic agenda for the coming years, it is crucial
for China to strengthen its economic relationship with ASEAN on the one
hand while reducing ASEAN claimants' security concerns on the other
hand. As a result, it should accelerate the adjustment of its South
China Sea policy; clarify China's stand on the issue, and propose
China's blueprint for resolving the disputes.¶ [[The]{.mark} South China
Sea [dispute has developed a seasonal pattern]{.mark}, where the first
half of the year is focused on conflicts, and the second half tends to
emphasize cooperation]{.underline}. Considering its timing at the peak
of 'conflict season,' the Shangri-La Dialogue serves as a hot spot.
Since 2012, the Shangri-La Dialogue has become a platform for the U.S.
and China to tussle on the South China Sea, with the U.S. being
proactive and China reactive. (Incidentally, this partly explains why
China is upgrading Xiangshan Forum as an alternative dialogue platform).
This year was no exception, as the U.S. worked hard to draw the world's
attention to the Shangri-La Dialogue this year.¶ But [audiences should
be aware that [aggressive statements]{.mark}]{.underline} at the
Shangri-La Dialogue [[are not]{.mark} totally [representative of]{.mark}
U.S.-China [relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, these statements
are made by military rather than political elites. Cooperation will be
the key when the U.S. and China have their Strategic and Economic
Dialogue in late June, with the ASEAN Regional Forum and other meetings
following later this summer.

#### No China war \-\-- CCP stability, deterrence, and economics 

**Nolt 17** \-\-- senior fellow at World Policy Institute and an adjunct
associate professor at New York University

(James H. Nolt, "The Unlikely Prospect of War with China", 2/16/17,
World Policy Blog,
http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2017/02/16/unlikely-prospect-war-china)

**[If war were to start between U.S. and China, [it]{.mark}
[would]{.mark} certainly [not be China that starts
it]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} There are several reasons I am
confident about that. **[First is that [China's]{.mark} collective
[leadership has a strong aversion to]{.mark} chaos and
[instability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Managing China's many problems
is tough enough]{.underline}**. **[[War would exacerbate]{.mark}
[these]{.mark} immensely]{.underline}**, as China's long and sad history
of war illustrates, especially since 1840. **[Second is that [China's
military]{.mark} forces [are much weaker than]{.mark} those of [the
U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}**., **[[particularly for]{.underline}]{.mark}**
any naval and air conflict in **[[the S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh
**[[or E]{.underline}]{.mark}**ast **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**eas. **[This is true even without
considering China's lack of]{.underline}** reliable **[military
allies]{.underline}**, **[whereas the U.S. has numerous powerful
military allies]{.underline}**, including (with the U.S. itself) eight
of the top 10 industrial powers on Earth. **[Third is that the [economic
consequences of]{.mark} any war with the U.S., [even a limited
war]{.mark}, [would be]{.mark} [much more severe for China]{.mark} than
for the U.S.]{.underline}** China's military planners might attempt
opportunistically to coerce isolated weaker countries, such as Vietnam,
but their posture toward the U.S. and Japan is to deter potential
foreign aggression rather than to initiate war. Furthermore, the
economic vulnerability of China in event of a war is not sensitive to
the lopsided military balance. **[Even if the U.S. halved its current
navy]{.underline}** and all of its numerous military allies stayed
neutral, **[[China's overseas trade would cease from the first day of
the war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, much like what happened to Germany in
both world wars. Many commentators suggest that China's new bases in the
South China Sea are changing this, but in doing so they fail to see the
bigger picture. Little of China's vital trade terminates in the South
China Sea. Most of it extends over vast oceans easy for U.S. naval power
to interdict with a distant blockade, just as the U.K. did to Germany
twice in the 20th century. **[[China is]{.mark} now [vastly]{.mark} more
[trade dependent]{.mark}]{.underline}** than it was when President
Carter established diplomatic relations in 1979. **[Much of the
machinery]{.underline}** for its factories **[comes from
Europe]{.underline}**, especially Germany. **[Much of its
oil]{.underline}** travels over the long sea route **[from the Persian
Gulf]{.underline}**. Much of its metal ores come from South America,
Canada, Australia, and India. Most of its exports are sold in North
America and Europe. Many of its best naval and air weapons come from
Russia. Though some of these could reach China by rail, with most of its
overseas trade stopped, China would lack the means to pay for
significant arms replenishment from Russia. **[The [Chinese]{.mark}
people's [living standard would fall]{.mark} drastically]{.underline}**
as many industries grind to a halt from lack of vital raw materials or
overseas markets. **[[It is extremely unlikely]{.mark} that [China's
leaders would]{.mark} willingly [inflict such a catastrophe]{.mark} on
themselves]{.underline}**. This is even before considering the
devastation likely inflicted by the fighting itself.

### AT: Colonialism Adv

#### The aff papers over neo-colonialism -- neo-colonialism functions through economic domination but uses symbolic reforms like the aff to justify continued subjugation.

**Andres 19** (Kenneth Andres; B.A. in Political Science from the
University of Alberta; "The Philippines: A Neo-colonial Experience";
4/19/2019; Medium;
https://medium.com/@kennethandres/the-philippines-a-neo-colonial-experience-5588f9369871)//Garfield-Ben

Like many countries in Latin America, [the Philippines has been a
continuous colony]{.underline}, first of Spain from 1565 until 1898,
then by the United States (U.S.) in 1898 until July 4, 1946. That is
[three hundred eighty-one years of subjugation]{.underline} under two
successive foreign masters. But [even after its formal
independence]{.underline} from the United States, [the country has
suffered further]{.underline} foreign control in the form of
[neo-colonial rule]{.underline} by the United States [disguised
in]{.underline} the seemingly innocuous [international financial
institutions (]{.underline}IFIs) known as the World Bank (WB) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). Through these IFIs many Filipinos
were driven to poverty --- if they were not already
impoverished --- [partly by the policies instituted by the
US]{.underline} in its meddling in Philippine domestic affairs. Some may
dismiss this line of argument as inaccurate, as things such as
corruption, natural disasters and high population growth, should count
as major contributors to its impoverishment. And I agree that these are
reasonable arguments, but these only cover part of the problem. To put
this topic into proper perspective, we should consider the case of
post-war Japan. Like the Philippines, Japan has suffered a comparable
degree of destruction during World War II; the only difference is that
the US took a very different course of action when it took control of
Japan's post-war reconstruction. For instance, instead of keeping the
traditional social hierarchy in place, the US drafted a constitution
that emphasized social equality. Also, Japan's economy benefited from
the partial dissolution of monopolies known as the zaibatsu. Likewise,
the US implemented land reform which helped in the distribution of
wealth. And lastly, the unionization of Japanese workers and the
American attempt at reforming the taxation system proved to be
instrumental to Japan's recovery.\[1\] Contrast all of these to the
reforms done to the Philippines, and add to these all [the years of
resource extraction by the foreign occupiers, aided by the local
elites]{.underline} who owned a sizable proportion of the country's
wealth, and one can see how colonialism and [neo-colonialism have
affected the Philippine economic development in the twentieth
century.]{.underline} Considering all these, I argue through the context
of dependency theory\[2\], that the colonial and neo-colonial policies
of the United States and the subsequent Bretton Woods system of
financial aid towards the Philippines are major factors to its
persistent economic underdevelopment during the twentieth century. In
almost all newly-independent societies, [extreme social inequity
is]{.underline} often [maintained as a convenient tool by colonial
powers in order to]{.underline} continue to have the means to
effectively [control and subjugate the]{.underline} formerly [colonized
masses]{.underline}. Indeed, social inequity remains as a tool for
neo-colonialism, something which is clearly reflected in the colonial
legacy of the U.S. in the Philippines. \[3\]\[4\] After the Philippines'
independence from American rule, the Americans left a society with
extremely huge wealth inequality that left a select number of families
fabulously wealthy in both land and political influence. Had the U.S.
intended to leave the Philippines with a society more conducive to
democracy (such as what the U.S. did to post-war Japan), the U.S. would
have made the country more egalitarian and [the U.S.]{.underline} would
not have [left a society so unequal that]{.underline} only [a
few]{.underline} indigenous [families own the majority of the country's
land and wealth]{.underline}. As a result, [instead of making the
Philippines more independent]{.underline} as a country, [it continues to
be under U.S. control]{.underline} thanks to the elites that it left in
place.\[5\] [The Philippine-American neo-colonial relationship began
immediately after the Philippine independence]{.underline} in 1946,
[with the]{.underline} inauguration of the [Bell Trade Act]{.underline}
of 1946, also known as the Philippine Trade Act. The Bell Trade Act was
anything but fair. First, the Act dismayed many Filipinos because it
pushed forward an overt neo-colonial policy in which Americans are
explicitly given "the right to own and operate public utilities and to
develop natural resources in the Republic on an equal footing with
Filipino citizens."\[6\] This basically means that Americans were
allowed to maintain their colonial footing over the Philippines with
their ability to operate businesses and own properties as if they were
right inside sovereign US territory. This is obviously no different to
any colonial power operating inside their colonies. Not only was the Act
an overt neo-colonial extension of US power over the Philippines, it was
also passed under neo-colonial auspices. In an undemocratic manner,
[local elites did everything in their power to muzzle
dissent.\[7\]]{.underline} Allied with the U.S., these select few
undoubtedly had a stake in the Act's passing. [Second, the newly
independent Philippines was blatantly blackmailed by the United
States]{.underline} (specifically by the Truman administration) through
its reluctance to sign the Philippine Rehabilitation Act if the
Philippine government refused to pass the Bell Trade Act. Even though
everything was already agreed upon in advance (i.e. before
independence), the Truman administration wanted both Acts to be signed
simultaneously post-independence to appear as if the Philippines had a
democratic say over the matter. This is because [**the U.S. was careful
not to appear to continue to exert control over the
Philippines**]{.underline} and be accused of being an imperialist.\[8\]
Considering their country's situation, the Filipino politicians who
dissented were thus forced to pass the Act out of desperation. Had they
chosen not to acquiesce, the financial help to start the Philippine
reconstruction (along with all the U.S. vested interests behind it),
would have never been loaned.\[9\] In view of all these, the Bell Trade
Act is thus an exemplary model of neo-colonial practice: discreet and
highly favourable for the colonial power. Still not content with all its
material hold of the archipelago's resources, the U.S. further increased
its grip over the Philippine affairs by propping up the dictatorship of
Ferdinand Marcos. This is demonstrated by the fact that the Philippines
received a marked increase in financial aid from the World Bank during
the start of the martial law years than in the years prior.\[10\] It is
thus safe to speculate that Marcos's dictatorship would not have been
possible without the aid of the WB which funded his corrupt and
repressive regime in exchange for further American access to the
Philippine market and natural resources. Thanks to the financial aid
provided by the WB, the Marcos regime more than tripled its military
budget from 1972 to 1976, suggesting that the WB was complicit in the
regime's repression of the masses.\[11\] If this is not enough meddling,
**[the WB also provided money to]{.underline}** the Philippine
government for agricultural development to **[maintain the status quo.
This was done through]{.underline}** its involvement in **[creating a
façade of token reforms]{.underline}**, such as raising agricultural
productivity through 'technological packages' and providing farmers with
a means to obtain credit. However, all these **[token reforms were only
meant to create the illusion of]{.underline}** peasant **[grievances
being addressed without actually doing anything
substantial]{.underline}**. [The government hoped that the majority of
peasants would not demand anything beyond this
façade]{.underline} --- or call for a full reform of the
system --- which was a demand that was being raised by the New People's
Army (NPA), an armed revolutionary group led by aggrieved peasants
calling for a more equitable distribution of land.\[12\] Likewise,
during the Marcos regime, [the World Bank]{.underline} encouraged, or
rather, [coerced the Philippine government to give up]{.underline} its
protectionist [policies in favour of neoliberal economics]{.underline}
that would benefit transnational corporations from the United States and
other Western nations at the expense of the Philippine-based
industries.\[13\] In 1970, the Philippine economy was structurally
adjusted when the government was unable to pay for its debt and had to
loan from the World Bank. To be able to pay for its debt, the World Bank
agreed to loan money to the Philippines with the condition that it
devalues its currency, the Philippine peso, at sixty per cent its value.
This ruined many domestic businesses. Filipino entrepreneurs went
bankrupt, and workers' wages dropped by as much as fifty percent.
Further structural adjustment programs were implemented when Marcos
initiated martial law in 1972. The World Bank subsequently encouraged
the opening up of the Philippine market to international trade. This
request was accomplished with little political resistance because
President Marcos had already systematically destroyed the Filipino
industrial elite and the urban working classes. The former through the
abolition of the Congress, and the latter through the dismantling of the
trade union movement. All these actions were approved of or sanctioned
by the World Bank.\[14\] [These structural adjustment programs made the
Philippines an attractive location for many transnational corporations
seeking a more favourable business environment,]{.underline} although at
a price. The Marcos regime created a number of export processing zones
where the Philippines "allows \[transnational corporations\] tax
holidays for the first few years of their operation, and \[the country\]
give them the right to deduct from their subsequent taxable income the
losses they may incur during the first five years of their
operation."\[15\] The indigenous population in those export processing
zones were forcibly driven out of their lands, its environment
destroyed, to make way for the corporations. All these examples
demonstrate how the [American neo-colonial policies]{.underline} in the
Philippines (later [disguised behind the façade of the World
Bank)]{.underline} have contributed to the country's economic stagnation
in the latter half of the twentieth century. The Marcos regime had also
worsened the situation, but not without the financial aid from the World
Bank which lent him billions of U.S. dollars only to squander them in
unproductive projects or for personal gain. The country accumulated a
massive amount of debt that current and future generations of Filipinos
would have to pay for. [Money that should have been spent
on]{.underline} social [welfare, infrastructure]{.underline}, providing
quality [education,]{.underline} and proper compensation for law
enforcement personnel to prevent corruption, etc., mostly [go to
servicing]{.underline} its [massive debt]{.underline}.\[16\] In 2005,
the Philippines asked the World Bank for debt forgiveness under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries program, but the Bank considers the
Philippines not heavily indebted despite the [eighty to ninety percent
of its tax revenue spent on debt service]{.underline}, with the rest
financed through loans from other sources. All these factors [contribute
to the cycle of poverty]{.underline}, more persistent than the natural
disasters and the high birth rate, both of which can be managed through
the creation of proper infrastructures and the implementation of
reproductive health education. Ultimately, it can be argued that many
other social and economic problems could have been addressed had the
Philippines not been made responsible for the debt it has never
benefited from.

### Israel fill-in

#### Yes fill-in -- The Philippine Defense department wants Israeli weapons

[Duterte said that]{.underline} aside from the fact that he likes US
President Donald Trump, [a change in]{.underline} some [policies in the
US made him think again.]{.underline} \"Well, America has been helpful.
[In the purchase of arms, we have a bad experience]{.underline} but
[they have a new policy]{.underline} now. [We are going to
reconsider]{.underline},\" Duterte said. The transaction on armaments
between the two countries encountered an issue in 2016 after some
legislators in the US questioned the sale of weapons to the Philippines
amid the alleged human rights violations under the Duterte
administration. On the other hand, [the **Department of National
Defense**]{.underline} (DND) [**welcomed the latest pronouncement** of
the President.]{.underline} \"Magkakaroon lalo ng momentum ngayon \'yung
ating modernization program noong binigyan na ng basbas ng Pangulo na

Director Arsenio Andolong. He added that the [DND plans to buy 16 Black
Hawk helicopters and additional]{.underline} unmanned [aerial vehicles

Heydarian, meanwhile, believes that the United States (US) is very much
willing to help other countries amid its rising tension with China.
\"Ang pwede kong sabihin dito dahil \'yung US-China tensions ay
umaakyat, ang US ngayon overall, mas tutulungan \'yung ibang bansa gaya
ng Pilipinas to stand up on their own,\" Heydarian told Unang Balita on
Tuesday. \"I think hindi ang pinaguusapan dito \'yung mga baril baril

Philippines President Rodrigo [Duterte on Tuesday told President Reuven
Rivlin that his country would **henceforth only buy weapons from Israel
due to its lack of restrictions**]{.underline}, as dozens of
demonstrators gathered outside the president's Jerusalem residence to
protest the controversial visit. According to a Hebrew-language
statement, [Duterte praised Israel for helping the Philippines win its
war on terror and said the Jewish state had aided the country on
intelligence matters on multiple occasions.]{.underline} He said he
instructed his military personnel to purchase weapons and military
equipment exclusively from Israel. **[The US is "a good friend," but if
we buy there are limitations,]{.underline}** also with Germany and
China, added Duterte, without elaborating on the restrictions. Though it
is not officially listed on his schedule, Duterte's trip to Israel was
expected to focus on exploring possible arms deals. [He has said in the
past that he sees Israel as an alternative supplier of weapons after the
US and other countries refused to sell him arms over human rights
violations.]{.underline} His visit comes amid a violent crackdown on
drug dealers back home that has been forcefully denounced by human
rights groups. Israel is among the world's top arms dealers, with nearly
60 percent of its defense exports going to the Asia-Pacific region,
according to Israeli Defense Ministry data. [The Philippines emerged as
a significant new customer in 2017,]{.underline} with sales of radar and
anti-tank equipment worth \$21 million. Israelis protest against the
visit of Philippines' President Rodrigo Duterte upon his arrival for a
meeting with President Reuven Rivlin in Jerusalem on September 4, 2018
(Yonatan Sindel/Flash90) Duterte, in his comments, was dismissive of the
criticism, saying his country upholds "morals and principles of
democracy." Dozens of protesters gathered outside Rivlin's residence on
Tuesday to demonstrate against the hosting of Duterte. Israel has found
itself in hot water previously for its arms sales, particularly in 2017
for supplying Myanmar with "advanced weapons" during the country's
ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya, a Muslim minority.

#### That's worse for Human Rights -- no disclosure, monitoring, or rules

**Giovannetti 1/17** (Megan Giovannetti; Journalist at The Progressive;

The Tel Aviv expo hall hummed with activity. Inside, [Israeli weapons
manufacturer]{.underline} and dealer SK Group proudly [displayed
artillery that was "combat-proven,"]{.underline} having been used by the
Israeli Defense Forces. [The Israeli spyware company NSO]{.underline}
Group Technologies also had its own sleek booth, with representatives
who [refused to speak to anyone who was not]{.underline} a [military or
government agent]{.underline}. NSO is the [creator of the surveillance
software Pegasus which has been]{.underline} reportedly [used
to]{.underline} persecute, jail, and even [kill journalists, activists,
and other dissidents]{.underline} in countries like Mexico and Saudi
Arabia. In early June, the tenth annual Israel Defense Exposition took
place in the "liberal" capital of Israel. Hundreds of Israeli and
international arms and cybersecurity companies showcased their
state-of-the-art weaponry to war industry dealers from all over the
world. Among the event's [attendees were military officials
from]{.underline} Myanmar, South Sudan, and [the
Philippines]{.underline}---just a few countries Israel sells to that
have been accused of wholesale violations of human rights. Early the
morning of June 4, various groups of Israeli human rights activists
peacefully protested outside the Tel Aviv expo hall. Delegates from
Amnesty International-Israel handed out flyers detailing truths
regarding some of Israel's most loyal customers. A banner in Hebrew
read, "Israel, stop exporting weapons to human rights abusers," while
members of the feminist anti-occupation group Coalition of Women for
Peace held posters reading, "Enter here for blood money" and "War starts
here." Coalition of Women for Peace activist Daniela, who declined to
give her last name due to safety concerns, told me that protesting the
expo is critical because it's getting bigger every year. As of this
year, Israel is the world's eighth largest exporter of weapons in the
world---"and the first if you calculate it per capita," she explains.
Daniela says [the lack of]{.underline} information and [regulation
allowed Israeli companies to "sell their weapons]{.underline} . . . to
any country in the world," [regardless of their human rights
records]{.underline}. Chen Brill Egri, a campaigner for Amnesty
International, said she came to demonstrate "because people come here
from countries like Myanmar and South Sudan, which are under
international embargoes, and other countries like the Philippines and
Angola, which are other countries we should not trade arms with."
Earlier this year, Amnesty published a report in Hebrew about private
[Israeli security companies continuously exporting]{.underline} weapons
and cyber technologies [to states that]{.underline} routinely [violate
human rights]{.underline} or commit crimes against humanity. The report
named states [including]{.underline} South Sudan, Myanmar, [the
Philippines,]{.underline} Cameroon, Azerbaijan, Sri Lanka, Mexico, and
UAE as "questionable." Furthermore, the report stated that "often these
[weapons reach their destination after a series of
transactions]{.underline}, thereby [skirting international monitoring
and]{.underline} the [rules]{.underline} of Israel itself." Brill Egri
explained that [there is no public disclosure of details]{.underline}
about which countries buy weapons or for what amounts. Amnesty
International, she says, is trying to amend existing legislation
regarding the supervision of Israeli exports, "so it will include one
section that says it is forbidden to give a license to countries that
commit human rights violations under humanitarian law."

#### Israeli sales are worse for human rights -- no oversight or enforcement 

**Harel 5/9** (Amos Harel; Journalist at Haaretz citing Amnesty
International;
"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-israel-arms-sales-to-dictators-pariahs-states-alarming-picture-1.7250048";

A thorough report by Amnesty International is harshly critical of
Israel's policies on arms exports. According to the report written in
Hebrew by the organization's Israeli branch, [Israeli
companies]{.underline} continue to [export weapons to countries that
systematically violate human rights]{.underline}. Israeli-made weapons
are also [found in the hands of armies and organizations committing war
crimes]{.underline}. The report points to eight such countries that have
received arms from Israel in recent years. Often [these weapons reach
their destination after a series of transactions]{.underline}, thereby
[skirting international monitoring and the rules of Israel
itself]{.underline}. Amnesty calls on the government, the Knesset and
the Defense Ministry to more tightly monitor arms exports and enforce
transparency guidelines adopted by other Western countries that engage
in large-scale weapons exports. In the report, Amnesty notes that the
supervision of the arms trade is "a global, not a local issue.
[The]{.underline} desire and [need for better monitoring of global arms
sales derives from]{.underline} tragic historical events such as
[genocide, bloody civil wars and the violent repression of citizens by
their governments]{.underline} .... There is a new realization that
[selling arms to governments and armies that employ violence only fuels
violent conflicts and leads to their escalation.]{.underline} Hence,
international agreements have been reached with the aim of preventing
leaks of military equipment to dictatorial or repressive regimes." [The
2014 Arms Trade Treaty established standards for trade in conventional
weapons. Israel signed the treaty but the cabinet never ratified
it.]{.underline} According to Amnesty, Israel has never acted in the
spirit of this treaty, neither by legislation nor its policies. "There
are functioning models of correct and moral-based monitoring of weapons
exports, including the management of public and transparent reporting
mechanisms that do not endanger a state's security or foreign
relations," Amnesty says. "Such models were established by large arms
exporters such as members of the European Union and the United States.
There is no justification for the fact that Israel continues to belong
to a dishonorable club of exporters such as China and Russia." In 2007,
the Knesset passed a law regulating the monitoring of weapons exports.
[The law authorizes the Defense Ministry to oversee such
exports]{.underline}, manage their registration and decide on the
granting of export licenses. The law defines defense-related exports
very broadly, including equipment for information-gathering, and forbids
trade in such items without a license. [The law does not include a
clause limiting exports when there is a high probability that these
items will be used in violation of international or humanitarian
laws.]{.underline} But the law does prohibit "commerce with foreign
agencies that are not in compliance with UN Security Council resolutions
that prohibit or limit a transfer of such weapons or missiles to such
recipients." According to Amnesty, "[the absence of monitoring and
transparency have for decades let Israel supply equipment and
defense-related knowledge to questionable states and dictatorial or
unstable regimes that have been shunned by the international community."
The report quotes a 2007 article by Brig. Gen. (res.) Uzi Eilam. "A
thick layer of fog has always shrouded the export of military equipment.
Destinations considered pariah states by the international community,
such as Chile in the days of Pinochet or South Africa during the
apartheid years, were on Israel's list of trade partners,"]{.underline}
Eilam wrote. "The shroud of [secrecy helped avoid pressure by the
international community]{.underline}, but also [prevented]{.underline}
any [transparency regarding decisions to sell arms to problematic
countries, leaving the judgment and decision in the hands
of]{.underline} a small number of people, mainly in [the defense
establishment]{.underline}." The report presents concrete evidence on
Israel's exports over the last two decades, with [arms going to eight
countries accused by international institutions of serious human rights
violations: South Sudan, Myanmar, the Philippines, Cameroon, Azerbaijan,
Sri Lanka, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates.]{.underline} In some of
these cases, [Israe]{.underline}l denied that it exported arms to these
countries at specifically mentioned times. In other cases it [refused to
give details.]{.underline} Israeli security-related exports In its
report, Amnesty relies on the research of other human rights groups, on
documentation published in the media in those eight countries, and on
information gathered by attorney Eitay Mack, who in recent years has
battled to expose Israel's arms deals with shady regimes. Amnesty
cross-checks descriptions of exported weapons with human rights
violations and war crimes by those countries. In its report, Amnesty
says that [some of these countries were under sanctions and a
weapons-sales embargo, but Israel continued selling them
arms.]{.underline} According to the organization, "[the law]{.underline}
on monitoring in its current format is insufficient and [has not managed
to halt the export of weapons to]{.underline} Sri Lanka, which massacred
many of its own citizens; to South Sudan, where the regime and army
committed ethnic cleansing and aggravated crimes against humanity such
as the mass rape of hundreds of women, men and girls; to Myanmar, where
the army committed genocide and the chief of staff, who carried out the
arms deal with Israel, is accused of these massacres and other crimes
against humanity; and to [the Philippines, where the regime and police
executed 15,000 civilians without any charges or trials."]{.underline}
Amnesty says that this part of the report "is not based on any report by
[the Defense Ministry]{.underline} relating to military equipment
exports, for the simple reason that the ministry [refuses to release any
information. The total lack of transparency by Israel regarding weapons
exports prevents any public discussion of the topic and limits any
research or public action intended to improve oversight."]{.underline}
One example is the presence of Israeli-made Galil Ace rifles in the
South Sudanese army. "With no documentation of sales, [one cannot know
when they were sold, by which company, how many, and so
on,]{.underline}" the report says.

### Canada Fill-in

#### Canada will continue selling weapons even if the US stops

Accessed: 7-3-2019, MWM)

The icy relationship between the two does not appear to have an impact
on business, however. This week it was revealed that -- despite
Trudeau's concerns -- Canada has brokered the sale of 16 combat utility
helicopters worth \$185m to the Philippine air force. Canada is the 15th
largest weapons exporter in the world, according to Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, and analysts say that
[[Trudeau's gov]{.mark}ernment [struggles to put]{.mark} its purportedly
[progressive standards ahead of commercial
interests.]{.mark}]{.underline} Canadian officials say they are
confident helicopters will be used for "disaster relief, search and
rescue, passenger transport and utility transport" in the Philippines.
But Major-General Restituto Padilla, [the [country's military
chief]{.mark} of plans, told Reuters the [helicopters]{.mark} would be
[used for "internal security operations"]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
prompting Canada to announce a review of the deal. "There's this 'sunny
ways', 'progressive Canada' image being sold to the world. But i[t is
[increasingly hard to reconcile]{.mark} the [gov]{.mark}ernment's
[foreign policy rhetoric with its practice,"]{.mark}]{.underline} says
Cesar Jaramillio, executive director of Project Ploughshares, a Canadian
disarmament group. ["Our [initial reaction]{.mark} \[to the helicopter
deal\] [is one of wonder. Why is Canada selling weapons to a]{.mark}
known [human rights violator?"]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Topicality

### T -- Substantial

#### Foreign Military Sales require Congressional notification of arms valued at \$14 million or more.

**[USNI News]{.underline}**. (20**[19]{.underline}**). Report to
Congress on Foreign Military Sales - USNI News. \[online\] Available at:
https://news.usni.org/2019/04/03/report-congress-foreign-military-sales-2
\[Accessed 27 Jun. 2019\].

This report reviews the process and procedures that currently apply to
congressional consideration of foreign arms sales proposed by the
President. This includes consideration of proposals to sell major
defense equipment, defense articles and services, or the retransfer to
third-party states of such military items. Under Section 36(b) of the
Arms Export Control Act (AECA), [[Congress must be]{.mark} formally
[notified]{.mark}]{.underline} 30 calendar days before the
Administration can take the final steps [[to conclude a]{.mark}
government-to-government [foreign military sale of major defense
equipment valued at \$14 million or more, defense articles or services
valued at \$50 million or more, or design and construction services
valued at \$200 million or more]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the case of
such sales to NATO member states, NATO, Japan, Australia, South Korea,
Israel, or New Zealand, Congress must be formally notified 15 calendar
days before the Administration can proceed with the sale. However, the
prior notice [[threshold values are higher for sales to NATO
members]{.mark}, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New
Zealand]{.underline}. Commercially licensed arms sales also must be
formally notified to Congress 30 calendar days before the export license
is issued if they involve the sale of major defense equipment valued at
\$14 million or more, or defense articles or services valued at \$50
million or more (Section 36(c) AECA). In the case of such sales to NATO
member states, NATO, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New
Zealand, Congress must be formally notified 15 calendar days before the
Administration is authorized to proceed with a given sale. As with
government-to-government sales, the prior notice threshold values are
higher for sales to NATO members, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel,
or New Zealand.

#### That excludes any country that doesn't receive at least 14 million. We'll insert a chart.

practices and procedures'.480 Having considered the ordinary meanings of
the term 'prevent, reduce, and control', '[prevent' means 'to stop
something from happening or someone from doing
something.]{.underline}'481 [The word 'reduce' means 'to make something
smaller in size, amount,]{.underline} degree, importance etc.'482 and
the word 'control' means 'to order, limit, or rule something or
someone\'s actions or behaviour.' 483 From the meanings, [the term
'prevent' suggests an action to stop the future occurrence of something,
whereas the terms 'reduce']{.underline} and 'control', noting their
difference[, point to an action dealing with something that has already
happened and continues to occur, but needs to be made smaller, limited
or regulated]{.underline}. Also, control also applies to future
pollution in the sense that it limits the future pollution to be created
or emitted not to exceed the specified level. Therefore, the preliminary
reading of these terms suggests that laws and regulations adopted to
deal with MPLA must yield the result that conforms with these terms. In
so doing, the adoption of laws and regulations to prevent, reduce, and
control MPLA can be done by legislating primary or secondary regulations
with the use of various legal techniques and procedures and are
underpinned by some rules and principles of international law discussed
in the previous chapter. These legal techniques and procedures can be
used to achieve the prevention, reduction and control of MPLA depending
on the design and use of them. Noting that the measures outlined below
are not exhaustive and not exclusively limited to implement any specific
obligation, these are typical legal techniques and procedures used to
prevent, reduce, and control pollution and therefore protect the
environment. They can be categorised into two groups, that is, (1)
substantive and (2) procedural legal techniques and measures. They can
be discussed hereunder.

#### The last US-Philippines FMS approved by congress was in 2014 and ended in 2017 -- here's the report:

WASHINGTON, [Jul 24, 2014]{.underline} -- The [State
Department]{.underline} has made a determination [approving a
possible]{.underline} [Foreign Military Sale to the Philippines for
C-130T aircraft]{.underline} and associated equipment, parts, training
and logistical support for an estimated cost of \$61 million. [The
Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification
notifying Congress of this possible sale on July 23, 2014.]{.underline}
The Government of the Philippines has requested a possible sale from
Department of Defense stock of two (2) C-130T Aircraft, and 10 T56-16
engines (8 installed and 2 spares). [Also included are logistical
sustainment and support for a period of three years]{.underline},
modification equipment and labor costs, spare and repair parts, support
equipment, publications and technical documentation, aircraft ferry
support, personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government and
contractor logistics and technical support services, and other related
elements of logistics and program support. The estimated cost is \$61
million.

#### Violation: They prevent future FMS, not reduce FMS.

#### Our standards are:

#### Ground -- the aff gets to spike out of topic disads by merely limiting the growth of arms sales instead of reducing them. 

#### Limits -- their interp allows the aff to spec countries to whom we don't currently sell a substantial amount of arms. Vote neg to protect the small amount of limits you can preserve on a large topic.

JL)

On June 5, [the United States delivered new military equipment to the
Philippines to **assist Manila in its fight against
terrorism.**]{.underline} The move is yet [another sign of the
continuing opportunities that exist for bilateral cooperation **despite
the challenges the alliance has faced under Philippine President Rodrigo
Duterte**]{.underline} thus far. [U.S.-Philippine security
cooperation]{.underline} has been ongoing for decades. Despite
controversy, varying levels of U.S. military presence -- which dates
back to 1898 when Washington first colonized the Philippines and
continued on even after the country gained independence in 1946 [--
helped the Philippine government confront various internal challenges,
ranging from communism to terrorism, while also deterring external
threats from the Soviet Union and then a rising China.]{.underline} But
the environment for bilateral collaboration has been complicated since
Duterte assumed the presidency last June. Duterte has vowed to pursue a
more independent foreign policy that diversifies Philippine alignments
away from its traditional ally the United States and toward other major
powers like China and Russia (See: "The Limits of Duterte's US-China
Rebalance"). He has also publicly criticized the U.S. military role in
the Philippines and downgraded some U.S.-Philippine security cooperation
(albeit not as sharply as his rhetoric initially suggested) (See: "Where
Are US-Philippine Defense Ties Under Duterte?"). Yet as I have
repeatedly noted, [the prospects for U.S.-Philippine defense ties are in
fact brighter than Duterte's personal sentiment might
suggest,]{.underline} in part because [his statements belie the **deep
institutional bonds between the U.S. and Philippine militaries** and
publics]{.underline} as well as the convergence of interests between the
two nations in the face of common challenges (See: "The US-Philippine
Alliance Under Duterte: A Path to Recalibration"). [Chief among these is
terrorism, as has been demonstrated by the Armed Forces of the
Philippines' (AFP's) struggle against Islamist militants in the city of
Marawi]{.underline} on the conflict-ridden southern island of Mindanao
in the past few weeks. [**The United States and the Philippines have a
long history of cooperation when it comes to terrorism**, which became a
focus especially after the September 11 attacks]{.underline}. The most
often cited manifestation of this was the Joint Special Operations Task
Force-Philippines (JSOTF-P) -- which started in 2002 and saw up to 600
official U.S. military personnel in the country. Though JSOTF-P was
deactivated back in 2015, some personnel continue to remain to advise
and assist Philippine security forces. Washington also continues to
provide various forms of aid to the Philippines today. On Monday, [in an
illustration of this continued U.S.-Philippine security collaboration,
the **United States provided another round of military equipment to the
Philippine military**]{.underline}. Officials from the Joint United
States Military Assistance Group (JUSMAG), which has been in the
Philippines since its establishment in 1947, turned over equipment
delivered recently under Washington's Counterterrorism Train and Equip
Program at a transfer ceremony at the Philippine Marine Corps (PMC)
headquarters in Taguig. According to the U.S. Embassy in Manila, 300 M4
carbines, 200 Glock 21 pistols, 4 M134D Gatling-style machine guns, and
100 M203 grenade launchers were delivered May 18-22 to Clark Air Base,
while 25 new Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) with outboard motors
were delivered on May 30 to PMC Headquarters. The [deliveries were just
the latest in a series that have continued e**ven after Duterte took
office**]{.underline}. In January, JUSMAG representatives delivered new
military equipment to the Philippine Army and Marine Corps, including
over 400 M203 grenade launchers, 85 M40A5 sniper rifles, and a RQ-11B
Raven unmanned aerial vehicle system consisting of three drones for
exclusive use and ownership by the Armed Forces of the Philippines. And
in October last year, JUSMAG delivered pallets of new military equipment
to the Philippine Marine Special Operations Group, Philippine National
Police-Special Action Force, and Philippine Coast Guard that included
tactical Harris radios, ballistic helmets, and diving gear. According to
the U.S. Embassy in Manila, over the past decade alone, JUSMAG has
delivered and programmed 7.3 billion Philippine pesos (\$147 million) of
military equipment to the AFP to enhance counterterrorism capabilities.
[This is apart from other assistance that the AFP receives through U.S.
programs such as Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and other grants from U.S.
agencies]{.underline}. The embassy calculates that in just the last five
years, the U.S. government has allocated 15 billion pesos (\$300
million) of grant funding to provide the AFP with equipment, including
corresponding upgrades and training. Apart from the recent
collaboration, it is worth noting that JUSMAG's history is itself a
powerful reminder of the history of U.S.-Philippine defense cooperation.
Since its founding in 1947, JUSMAG Philippines has provided aid and
assistance to the AFP in various areas including training, equipment,
and organization. This year marks its 70th anniversary, and in March the
U.S. Embassy inaugurated the Major General Albert M. Jones Memorial
Award, which recognizes the first JUSMAG chief, who had survived the
infamous Bataan Death March during the Japanese occupation of the
Philippines during World War II. The award was presented to Philippine
Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who in receiving the award also
stressed the importance of U.S. counterterrorism assistance.

But [the consequences would go far beyond the effects in the target
country]{.underline}, however, [and]{.underline} promptly **[propagate
worldwide]{.underline}**. [Global and national security, economy and

systems, and the behavior of governments and individuals would all be
put under **severe trial**]{.underline}. The severity of the effects at
a national level, however, would depend on the countries' level of
development, geopolitical location, and resilience. [Global security and
regional/national defense schemes would be strongly
affected]{.underline}. [An **[increase in global distrust]{.mark}**
would **spark [rising tensions]{.mark}** among countries and
blocs]{.underline}, [that could even [lead to]{.mark} the **brink of
[nuclear]{.mark} weapons use** by states]{.underline} (if, for instance,

Regarding the economic and financial impacts[, a **[severe global
economic depression]{.mark}** would rise from the attack]{.underline},
likely **[[lasting for years]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Its duration would
be strongly dependent on the course of the crisis. The main results of
such a crisis would include a 2 percent fall of growth in global Gross
Domestic Product, and a 4 percent decline of international trade in the
two years following the attack (cf. Figure 3). In the case of developing
and less-developed countries, the economic impacts would also include a
shortage of high-technology products such as medicines, as well as a
fall in foreign direct investment and a severe decline of international
humanitarian aid toward low-income countries. We expect an increase of
unemployment and poverty in all countries. Global poverty would raise
about 4 percent after the attack, which implies that at least 30 million
more people would be living in extreme poverty, in addition to the
current estimated 767 million. [In the area of international
relations]{.underline}, [we would expect a **breakdown of key
doctrines** involving politics]{.underline}, [security, and relations
among states]{.underline}. These [**international tensions could lead to
[a collapse of the nuclear order]{.mark}** as we know it
today]{.underline}, [with a consequent **setback of nuclear
disarmament** and **nonproliferation commitments**]{.underline}. In

**[N]{.mark}**on- **[P]{.mark}**roliferation **[T]{.mark}**reaty [would
be put under **severe trial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [After the
attack]{.underline}, [there would be a reassessment of existing security
doctrines]{.underline}, and a deep review of concepts such as nuclear
deterrence, no-firstuse, proportionality, and negative security
assurances. Finally, the behavior of governments and individuals would
also change radically. **[Internal chaos]{.underline}** [fueled by the
media and social networks would **threaten governance at all
levels**]{.underline}, [with greater impact on those countries with weak
institutional frameworks]{.underline}. [**[Social turbulence]{.mark}**

also [be]{.underline} a **[[significant increase in]{.mark} social
[fragmentation]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- with a [deepening of

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND SOUTHEAST ASIA [The Philippines is
important to American national security and foreign policy in
Asia]{.underline}. The country is a former U.S. colony with deep
historical and cultural ties to the United States, the world's 12th
largest country by population, a lively democracy, and the region's
fastest-growing economy with a robust trade and investment relationship
with the United States. [Since signing the [M]{.mark}utual
[D]{.mark}efense [T]{.mark}reaty in 1951, the Philippines has been one
of the United States' two treaty allies in Southeast Asia]{.underline}.
[Regionally, **[it is one of our most important security partners in the
Asia-Pacific]{.mark},**]{.underline} as the U.S. has sought to expand
cooperation throughout the region, including with Singapore, Malaysia,
Indonesia, and Vietnam. There are two attributes of the U.S.-Philippine
security relationship that distinguish it from most American security
partnerships in East Asia. First, [the Philippines has a complicated
security environment, encompassing significant internal
challenges]{.underline}. The country is a 7,000-island archipelago, much
of it low-lying and especially vulnerable to natural disasters such as
typhoons. This places significant demand on the Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) to conduct humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
(HA/DR) operations. [Throughout [the Philippines']{.mark} history, it
has also [dealt with]{.mark} domestic challenges related to **[crime,
militancy, piracy, and terrorism]{.mark}**---]{.underline}including the
world's longest-running communist insurgency by the New People's Army
(NPA) as well as a decades-long Muslim separatist movement in Mindanao,
the southernmost large island in the country with the world's
third-largest Catholic population. [The high salience of internal
security challenges is relatively unusual among the United States'
treaty allies and partners in Asia.]{.underline} As a result, the
Philippines has long placed a heavy emphasis on internal security issues
and capabilities. During the Cold War, [the United States guaranteed the
Philippines' external security via the Mutual Defense
Treaty]{.underline}, projecting power in Asia from the Clark Air Base
and Subic Bay Naval Station; the AFP focused primarily on internal
security. Under the previous president, Benigno Aquino III, the
Philippines had begun to shift its focus toward external defense,
embarking on a defense modernization program that, among other things,
started the process of moving the land-heavy AFP toward more air and
maritime capabilities. Aquino also pursued international arbitration to
challenge Chinese actions in the South China Sea and increased
cooperation with the United States and other regional security partners,
such as Japan and Australia, in pursuit of those capabilities. [Since
assuming the presidency, Duterte has, to varying degrees, pulled back
(or threatened to do so) from all of these initiatives---questioning the
value of the U.S. alliance and the more recent Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), courting Chinese investment and
infrastructure assistance, and declining to press Beijing on its actions
in the South China Sea after the arbitration court ruled primarily in
Manila's favor in 2016.]{.underline} Duterte's focus on internal
security, therefore, is a return to the more inward focus that the AFP
and Philippine government have traditionally held since 1945. I will
return to that issue in the section below. Second, the U.S.-Philippine
alliance generally functions best when it does so with full awareness of
the domestic political dynamics in the Philippines. **[The Philippines
is, by any survey you look at, consistently one of the most pro-American
places on earth]{.underline}**. There are strong people-to-people ties
and broad and stable goodwill toward the United States among the public.
Recent and repeated comments by President Rodrigo [Duterte]{.underline}
about the United States---[often using colorful and inflammatory
language]{.underline}---have, in the minds of many in Washington,
complicated the ability of the United States to formulate and implement
effective security cooperation with the Philippines. [The difficulty,
however, should not be overstated or presented as an issue that is
solely to do with Duterte]{.underline}. His statements echo---albeit
using very different language---a long tradition of concern on the part
of the Philippine left regarding potential U.S. encroachment on
Philippine sovereignty, and vacillation on just how closely Manila
should tie itself to Washington. That same nationalistic sentiment
contributed to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Philippine bases in
the early 1990s (along with the volcanic eruption at Mt. Pinatubo), and
that propelled activists to successfully advocate for the Philippine
constitution to explicitly forbid permanent foreign military bases,
meaning that American forces rotate through under a Visiting Forces
Agreement signed in 1999. The 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation
Agreement expanded the number of facilities available to that rotational
presence, including Lumbia Airfield in Cayagan de Oro in Mindanao. These
**[[domestic political dynamics are important to navigate
carefully---but]{.mark} they do [not make the alliance
unmanageable]{.mark}.]{.underline}** RECENT CHANGES IN THE PHILIPPINES'
SECURITY ENVIRONMENT During the past two decades, **[[American security
cooperation with the Philippines has focused]{.mark} primarily [on
counterterrorism or maritime security]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [From 2002
to 2015, the United States deployed several hundred special operations
personnel to the southern Philippines for counterterrorism
purposes.]{.underline} The primary focal point of that cooperation, the
Joint Special Operations Task Force-Philippines (JSOTFP), was
discontinued in early 2015 after U.S. involvement in a controversial
operation, though the United States has, at the request of the
Philippine government and military, provided intelligence, surveillance,
reconnaissance, and other technical assistance during the recent
operations in Marawi. [As tensions have risen in the South China Sea,
much of U.S. security cooperation in recent years has focused on
maritime security, in keeping with the growing emphasis of the AFP on
these missions.]{.underline} As part of this, the U.S. has refocused or
added programs aimed at building the Philippines' naval and coast guard
capabilities, as well as strengthening the country's maritime domain
awareness. The United States has also regularly sent ships and personnel
to the region for humanitarian missions, such as its assistance after
Typhoon Yolanda struck the Philippines in November 2013, and the U.S.
military's ongoing participation in Operation Pacific Angel to deliver
humanitarian assistance and training. [[Over the]{.mark} course of the
[past year]{.mark} or so, however, [concerns about terrorist
activity]{.mark} in Mindanao [have increased]{.mark}]{.underline}. These
[concerns have focused on ["black flag" **militant groups**]{.mark}
based in the southern Philippines, which have sworn loyalty to the
Islamic State (ISIS) and **[received recognition from
ISIS]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and on the threat posed by ISIS-affiliated
fighters returning to the region from fighting in the Middle East. In
late November 2016, one of these **[[ISIS-linked
groups]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the Maute group, occupied Butig in Lanao
del Sur for five days. [Fighting has been prolonged in Marawi, where
ISIS-aligned fighters---principally from the Maute group, Abu Sayyaf,
and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters---have coordinated to hold
parts of the city in an urban siege that has now lasted over two
months.]{.underline} At the time of writing, Mindanao has been under
martial law for 60 days and the Philippine legislature has granted
approval for it to remain so until the end of 2017. Almost 600 people
have been killed in the fighting, around a quarter-million civilians
have been displaced, and significant parts of the city have been
destroyed. [Th**e Maute group was suspected of placing a bomb near the
U.S. embassy** in Manila last November and of bombing President
Duterte's hometown of Davao.]{.underline} [The appearance of foreign
fighters in Marawi]{.underline}---not just Malaysians and Indonesians,
but reportedly also Saudi, Yemeni, and Chechen fighters---[[raises **the
possibility that** Mindanao **will become a central attraction for
jihadists unable to travel to the Middle East**]{.mark}]{.underline} or
attracted to the operational, physical foothold being established in
Mindanao. [The collapse of a 2014 peace agreement between the government
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) has exacerbated this
territorial and political challenge]{.underline}, as militants
disillusioned with the peace process turn to more radical ISIS-linked
organizations instead. At the same time, [[concerns about
kidnapping-for-ransom operations]{.mark} by the terrorist group Abu
Sayyaf in the waters around the southern Philippines [have]{.mark} also
[heightened]{.mark}]{.underline}. Western **[[hostages have been
executed]{.underline}]{.mark}** when ransom demands were not met, while
[[payments]{.underline}]{.mark} made for other hostages raise concern
that these operations help **[[bankroll ISIS-linked
militants]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Philippine press reported last
fall that Abu Sayyaf, which has pledged allegiance to ISIS, had raised
at least \$7 million in 2016 from its kidnapping operations. As a result
of concerns about security in these waters and the safety of trade
between the two countries, Indonesia temporarily suspended shipping and
banned coal exports to the Philippines (70 percent of the country's
supply). These [kidnapping-for-ransom operations, therefore, are not
only a maritime security and law enforcement issue, but a matter for
counterterrorism and trade throughout the region.]{.underline} In short,
the emergence of links between militant groups in Mindanao, including a
resurgent Abu Sayyaf, and the Islamic State, especially in the context
of the collapse of the 2014 peace agreement, led to a significant
increase in the counterterrorism threat in the southern Philippines, and
pose risks to the trade that passes through the Sulu Sea.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL SECURITY COOPERATION [The United States
has compelling security interests in active security engagement with the
Philippines and its neighbors in Southeast Asia]{.underline}. There are
six major ways that existing security cooperation can be adapted to
address the evolving terrorist threat. First, [[**active engagemen**t by
both the **executive branch and by Congress to signal a U.S. presence,
participation in, and commitment to the Philippines can have a real
positive impact.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Concern about Duterte is
understandable, but the Philippines remains strongly pro-American and
cognizant of the benefits of a robust security relationship. At present,
that engagement can most productively be focused on the bureaucracy,
military, legislature, local governments, civil society, and things like
continued humanitarian missions that affirm the shared values
underpinning the alliance. Broader engagement with ASEAN, including but
not limited to a Congressional delegation to the region (including the
Philippines), would indicate strong, bipartisan support for the efforts
that administration officials have made thus far to signal the
importance of the region and outline a vision of the U.S. role in a
peaceful, prosperous, and free Asia. Second, the United States could
consider expanding maritime security assistance and continue its efforts
to strengthen Philippine maritime domain awareness. Executed well, this
has potential to simultaneously improve the Philippine government and
military's ability to address multiple priorities: conducting HA/DR
operations, improving law enforcement and counterterrorism capabilities,
and boosting external defense. It is important that, even as the
Philippines deals with intensifying internal security and terrorist
threats, it does not abandon efforts to strengthen its maritime
capacities and defenses in the South China Sea. The Philippines received
a significant portion of the Maritime Security Initiative's 2016
funding, and given the exigency of current security needs, it makes
sense for that trend to continue. Maritime capacity-building has the
additional advantage of focusing on cooperation that doesn't raise human
rights concerns under the Leahy Amendment, and will allow the United
States to contribute where security interests overlap, while still
voicing strong support for democratic values such as human rights. This
will help strike the right balance between recognizing the popular
support that Duterte has had thus far, and strongly affirming the shared
values upon which today's alliance is based. Third, if the Philippines
requests it, the United States should be willing to examine options for
re-activating formal counterterrorism cooperation with Manila, such as
the previous Joint Special Operations Task Force-Philippines. With the
U.S. military already providing technical assistance to the AFP, clearly
defining the parameters of American forces' involvement---insofar as
possible given security considerations, of course---and proactively
affirming that this presence will be consistent with the Philippine
constitution may help avoid domestic sensitivities. It is not necessary
or desirable for U.S. counterterrorism assistance to become a political
football in Philippine domestic politics. Careful communication will
help keep the focus on the important shared interest that our two
countries have: preventing ISIS from establishing a physical foothold
inside the territory of a U.S. treaty ally in Asia. Fourth, [the United
States can support Manila's efforts to cooperate with other U.S.
security partners, including Japan, South Korea, Australia, Indonesia,
and Malaysia.]{.underline} The launch of trilateral patrols and
information-sharing among Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines in
June were an important step to boost regional cooperation on
counterterrorism and counter-piracy. Strengthening the Philippines'
naval, coast guard, and maritime law enforcement capability as described
above is important to giving this cooperation teeth; partners like
Japan, Australia, and South Korea can play an important role,
heightening the impact of American assistance. Fifth, the United States
can identify productive forms of economic engagement with the
Philippines and Southeast Asia. This includes not just focused trade
agreements on travel goods, but efforts to strengthen regional financial
tools for combatting terrorism. Like maritime capacity-building
measures, these efforts can achieve multiple priorities---such as
strengthening the regional financial architecture to counteract North
Korea's money laundering and revenue-generating activities in the
region. It will be especially important to proactively limit the flow of
funds from ISIS agents in the Middle East into Southeast Asia to limit
the growth and operational capabilities of ISIS-affiliated groups.
Boosting economic cooperation will also help the Philippines to navigate
a dilemma increasingly faced by Washington's East Asian allies: reliance
on the United States for security, but China for economic prosperity.
Sixth, [Washington must be thoughtful about, and should monitor closely,
the political context in which ISIS-linked terrorism might unnecessarily
be able to gain greater traction]{.underline}. There is little question
that the collapse of the 2014 peace agreement between the government and
the MILF, and the resultant failure to create the Bangsamoro region in
Mindanao, have contributed to the splintering of individuals and
factions away from the MILF and toward more radical groups. Despite
Duterte's stated support for the Bangsamoro region, it remains to be
seen exactly how he---and the majority Catholic legislature---will
approach this question, and what success Duterte's efforts might have in
bringing an end to the decades-long conflict in Mindanao. Regionally,
the treatment of the Rohingya Muslim population in Myanmar is a
grievance that could be a recruitment tool and rallying cry for Islamic
militants across Southeast Asia. The Unites States should therefore
closely monitor the progress of these issues, and express support for
the development of effective, inclusive, long-term solutions to two of
the region's longest-standing points of tension. CONCLUSION The
resurgence of terrorist threats in the southern Philippines, and
especially the activities of groups with new links to ISIS, has raised
new questions about the shape and focus of U.S. security cooperation
with the Philippines. In crafting that cooperation, it is helpful for
American policymakers to be aware of both the delicate balance between
the internal and external security needs that Manila has long had to
strike, and the domestic sensitivities that can trip up robust security
cooperation. With these factors in mind, [there are many areas in which
the United States can adjust and strengthen its security cooperation
with the Philippines, and can work together with Manila to prevent ISIS
from developing a territorial foothold on the soil of a U.S. ally in
Asia.]{.underline}

[The end of hostilities in Marawi city in Mindanao has underscored **the
critical importance of the Philippines' military alliance with
America,** despite attempts by President Rodrigo Duterte to forge closer
defence ties with China and Russia.]{.underline} According to the Chief
of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) General Eduardo
Ano, [**US assistance during the five-month conflict was instrumental in
"tilting the balance" against the pro-Islamic State militants**. US
forces provided the AFP with invaluable real-time
surveillance]{.underline} of the battlespace using drones and P-3 Orion
aircraft, intelligence and urban warfare training. The US also
transferred 300 assault rifles, 200 pistols, 100 grenade launchers, four
heavy machine guns and two Cessna surveillance aircraft. Chinese
military assistance was not insignificant but consisted solely of
hardware. China provided 6,000 assault rifles and 9 million rounds of
ammunition, almost half of which was transferred to the Philippine
National Police. According to Duterte, it was a Chinese-made sniper
rifle that was used to kill militant leader Isnilon Haplon, although
Philippines army rangers subsequently said it was a heavier,
US-manufactured weapon mounted on an armoured vehicle that had killed
him. On 25 October, [Russia delivered 5,000 assault rifles]{.underline},
1 million rounds of ammunition, 4 military vehicles and 5,000 helmets.
[However, by the time the equipment had arrived in the Philippines the
government had declared the siege was over.]{.underline} [Although
Duterte was initially reluctant to acknowledge US support, by the end of
the conflict he was praising American aid]{.underline}: "I would not say
they were our saviours, but they are our allies and they helped us". He
also stated that previous disputes with America were "water under the
bridge". [The conflict in Marawi highlights the AFP's preference for US
military assistance over other countries, and **the high levels of
comfort and interoperability between the US and Philippine armed
forces**]{.underline} built up over nearly seven decades. While the
Philippines' defence cooperation with China and Russia will undoubtedly
grow incrementally, [America will remain the country's most important
security partner for the foreseeable future.]{.underline}

China Sea,\" Eurasia Review,
https://www.eurasiareview.com/07062019-us-made-drones-monitor-south-china-sea/)///PSC

**[The United States is selling more drones to the Philippines, which
will be used in part to monitor the Chinese presence in the disputed
South China Sea,]{.underline}** Filipino sources said Thursday. The U.S.
Department of Defense (DoD) last week announced an order for 34
ScanEagle unmanned aerial vehicles on behalf of the Philippines,
Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam at a total price tag of U.S. \$47.9
million. **[The Philippines already acquired six ScanEagle drones in
2018 after receiving intelligence support from the U.S. in defeating
Islamic State militants who took over the southern city of Marawi for
five months in 2017]{.underline}**. The intel assistance helped erode an
anti-U.S. posture taken by President Rodrigo Duterte's administration, a
senior Philippine defense source told BenarNews. "[Manila had no way but
to accept the American help. Later, Duterte reversed his anti-American
stance," the source said. "The help was first geared toward monitoring
militants in the wake of Marawi, but the help has evolved toward the
SCS, and the heavy Chinese presence there]{.underline}," he added,
referring to the South China Sea. Negotiations for the purchase of the
drones had been going on for a long time, and would likely go through, a
Philippine defense expert told BenarNews on condition of anonymity.
"**[It's not expensive tech," he said of the eight drones earmarked for
Manila under the new deal at a cost of \$9.6 million.]{.underline}**
Under the package announced by the Pentagon on May 31, Malaysia will
acquire 12 of the drones for \$19.3 million; Indonesia will get eight of
them for \$9.1 million; and Vietnam a half-dozen ScanEagles for \$9.7
million, according to the DoD. [Although the drones are identical, the
orders include spare repair parts, tools and spare payloads, with each
country issuing orders based on their tactical requirement]{.underline}.
"The announcement marks the first time that military equipment will be
transferred to Vietnam following the end of a U.S. arms embargo imposed
since the communist takeover there in 1975," DefenseNews reported,
noting that the embargo was fully lifted three years ago. The contract
through the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program was awarded to Insitu, a
subsidiary of the Boeing Co. and production of the 34 drones is
scheduled for completion in March 2022, the Pentagon said in a news
release. The ScanEagle weighs only about 40 pounds (18.1 kg) and is
about 4-feet (1.2-meters) long with a wingspan of a little more than 10
feet (3 meters). It can fly to an altitude of 16,000 feet (4,877
meters), UPI reported. Lt. Col. David Eastburn, a spokesman for the
Pentagon, declined to comment on whether the package of drones to the
four Southeast Asian nations was tied to U.S. efforts to monitor or
contain Chinese movements in the South China Sea. Citing DoD policy, he
referred BenarNews to the U.S. State Department. State department
officials did not immediately respond to questions from BenarNews on
Thursday. An Indonesian Defense Ministry spokesman had no immediate
comment; **[Malaysian Deputy Defense Minister Liew Chin Tong told
BenarNews, "the ministry will issue a statement on Friday on the
matter." 'Boosting maritime domain awareness' The package of 34 drones
"would afford greater intelligence gathering capabilities potentially
curbing Chinese activity in the \[South China Sea\]
region,"]{.underline}** according to a report by Reuters last week.
**[In the Philippines, the BusinessMirror news website reported on
Wednesday that the Filipino military was "looking forward to further
boosting its maritime domain awareness, especially in the West
Philippine Sea, its humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief
operations and counterterrorism capabilities,"]{.underline}** through
the addition of the eight other U.S.-made drones. The West Philippine
Sea is what Filipinos call the South China Sea. Beijing claims most of
the mineral-rich sea region, including areas that reach the shores of
its smaller neighbors. [China has been expanding and militarizing
structures it built in the region, despite earlier agreements to halt
all construction activities. The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam
and Taiwan also have territorial claims in the strategic
waterway.]{.underline} In March 2018, when the Philippines acquired its
first six ScanEagles, Filipino Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said
the **[drones would be vital "in the conduct of intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance operations in support of a variety of
missions such as territorial defense, security and
stability."]{.underline}** "With a number of security issues confronting
our country, there is a need to upgrade our nation's armed forces and to
establish a more credible defense," Manila's defense chief said then,
adding that the ScanEagle drones were a way to deter "those who want to
wage war against our country." The U.S. Navy, meanwhile, has been
sailing ships through the sea region in a show of force in the face of
Chinese activities and to uphold the international principle of freedom
of navigation. On June 1, [Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick
Shanahan told a regional security meeting in Singapore that Washington
was investing money in bolstering the defensive positions of allies in
the region and pushing for free navigation in the South China
Sea.]{.underline} "Behavior that erodes other nations' sovereignty and
sows distrust of China's intentions must end," he said during speech at
the Shangri-La annual forum. "Until it does, we stand against a myopic,
narrow, and parochial vision of the future, and we stand for the free
and open order that has benefited us all -- including China."

WASHINGTON \-- [The Trump administration has moved ahead with a
surveillance drone sale to 4 US allies in the South China Sea region as
acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said Washington will no longer
\"tiptoe\" around Chinese behavior in Asia]{.underline}. The drones
would afford greater intelligence gathering capabilities potentially
curbing Chinese activity in the region. Shanahan did not directly name
China when making accusations of \"actors\" destabilizing the region in
a speech at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Saturday but
went on to say the United States would not ignore Chinese behavior. [The
Pentagon announced on Friday it would sell 34 ScanEagle drones, made by
Boeing Co. to the governments of Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines
and Vietnam for a total of \$47 million]{.underline}. China claims
almost all of the strategic South China Sea and frequently lambastes the
United States and its allies over naval operations near Chinese-occupied
islands. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and
Vietnam have competing claims. [The Pentagon said Friday\'s sales
included spare and repair parts, support equipment, tools, training and
technical services and work on the equipment was expected to be
completed by March 2022. As many as 12 unarmed drones and equipment
would go to Malaysia for about \$19 million]{.underline}. Indonesia, the
world\'s largest Muslim-majority country would buy 8 drones, the
Philippines 8, and Vietnam 6. In 2018, US President Donald Trump\'s
administration rolled out a long-awaited overhaul of US arms export
policy aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it would bolster the
American defense industry and create jobs at home. That initiative eased
rules for exporting some types of lethal as well as non-lethal US-made
drones to potentially dozens more allies and partners. [There is no
armed version of the ScanEagle, but Insitu, the division of Boeing that
makes the drone, also makes the RQ-21A Blackjack which is an optionally
armed drone used by US Navy and Marine Corps]{.underline}.

terrorists in Mindanao,\" Straits Times,

MANILA - [The Philippines on Tuesday (March 13) received its first six
military-grade drones purchased from the United States, as it steps up
its efforts against Islamist militants believed to have regrouped just
months after their defeat in the southern city of Marawi]{.underline}.
The six drones - costing US\$13.6 million (S\$17.9 million) - are Scan
Eagle unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are small, long-endurance
and low-altitude UAVs built by Insitu, a subsidiary of Boeing. They can
stay in the air for more than 20 hours, and have a maximum flight height
of 10,000 ft. Each drone is 1.2 m long with a wingspan of 3m, and is
launched using an air-powered catapult. The drones are equipped with
electro-optic, infrared and high-resolution video cameras that can track
both stationary and moving targets. **[Air Force spokesman Aristides
Galang said these UAVs would be used to track terrorists in the
insurgency-wracked southern island of Mindanao]{.underline}**. They will
also be used **[for "limited maritime patrols" and to support government
efforts against illegal logging and fishing]{.underline}**. The
Philippine military had earlier took delivery of three AeroVironment
RQ-11B Raven hand-launched drones, and is in line to aquire two General
Atomics RQ-1 Predator UAVs. The military had to rely on drones operated
by US Special Forces and AP-3C Orion surveillance planes flown by the
Royal Australian Air Force to keep track of about 1,000 Islamist
militants who stormed and seized large parts of Marawi city in Mindanao
in May last year. The audacious bid by the Maute extremist group to turn
Marawi into a province of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)
ended in October when the military recaptured the city. But **[at least
300 fighters managed to flee and counter-terrorism experts believe the
militants have regrouped, and are already planning attacks elsewhere in
Mindanao.]{.underline}** They are said to be using money and jewellery
looted from Marawi to grow their ranks in Mindanao. **[They are also
getting help from militants forced out of Iraq and Syria]{.underline}**.
"[**ISIS Philippines is discreetly recruiting members like wildfire**,
and it has established strong sleeper cells in key vulnerable cities in
Mindanao,]{.underline}" said security analyst Rommel Banlaoi, chair of
the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research.
Intelligence reports have indicated that **[militants are plotting to
storm or set off bombs in the densely populated and much larger cities
of Iligan and Cotabato]{.underline}**. On Sunday, the military claimed
it killed at least 44 militants from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom
Fighters (BIFF) during clashes in Maguindanao province. The BIFF has
sworn allegiance to ISIS, and is an ally of the Maute extremist group.

two oceans away from the arid birthplace of the Islamic State, are
taking the terrorist brand name into new battles. [As worshipers
gathered in January for Sunday Mass at a Catholic cathedral, two bombs

it's happening all over[." The group first made a big push for southern
Philippines recruitment in 2016, circulating videos online beckoning
militants who could not travel to its self-proclaimed caliphate in Iraq
and Syria]{.underline}. Hundreds of fighters poured in from as far away
as Chechnya, Somalia and Yemen, intelligence officials said. The next
year, [militants who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State took
over the city of Marawi in Mindanao]{.underline}. By the time the army
prevailed five months later, the largest Muslim-majority city in the
country lay in ruins. At least 900 insurgents were killed, including
foreign fighters and Isnilon Hapilon, the Islamic State's East Asia
emir. [On Basilan, local officials say that the island is now safe from

responded with airstrikes and 10,000 soldiers in Jolo, according to Col.

Zamboanga. [On a visit to a cathedral in Jolo that was bombed by

slipstream of Islamist extremism. Top officials have played down
incidents in which the Islamic State has sent foreign fighters and
financing to the Philippines for deadly attacks. [The violence, they
often say, is squabbling between Muslim clans, or common
banditry]{.underline}. Within a week of the Jolo cathedral bombing, the
police declared the case solved, blaming a local militant group, Abu
Sayyaf, with scant acknowledgment of how many of its insurgents have
partnered with the Islamic State. Visiting the Jolo cathedral, Our Lady

that needs to be looked at more deeply because the threat is not just
local. It's maybe coming from outside, from ISIS."]{.underline} For
decades, **[local insurgencies like Abu Sayyaf, which launched a
campaign of bombings and beheadings, have thrived in the lawless
wilderness and seas stretching toward Malaysia and

mujahedeen battlefields in Afghanistan and hard-line madrassas in Yemen
and Saudi Arabia, local grievances fused with global calls for jihad. In
a crescent-shaped swath of Southeast Asia, militants dreamed of a
caliphate free of secular governance. Jemaah Islamiyah, the Qaeda
offshoot that killed more than 200 people in a Bali nightclub in 2002,
trained recruits in Philippine jungles. [Later, as the Islamic State
constructed its caliphate in the Middle East, it connected disparate
militants in the Philippines under one ideological banner, said Sidney
Jones, the director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in
Jakarta, Indonesia.]{.underline} "The government didn't recognize its
strength in attracting everyone from university-educated students to Abu
Sayyaf kids in the jungle," Ms. Jones said. "[Whatever happens to the
pro-ISIS coalition in Mindanao, it has left behind the idea of an
Islamic state as a desirable alternative to corrupt
democracy]{.underline}." Basilan officials say the island is now safe
from the Abu Sayyaf separatists who began their fight in 1991. No
foreign fighters are hiding in the jungles, the local authorities
insist, and they claim that the rebels have been reduced to about 20
trapped stragglers. But [Colonel Besana puts the overall number of

school playing with mobile devices in Zamboanga. Mr. Indama, [the former
fighter who says he left Abu Sayyaf last year because he rejected the
Islamic State's ideology, claimed he saw foreign operatives in the

have stolen onto Basilan was shattered last July when it was the site of
the first suicide bombing in the Philippines. The Islamic State claimed
that the attack, which killed 11 people, had been the work of a Moroccan
recruit]{.underline}. The Philippine authorities initially denied the
attack had been by a suicide bomber, much less a foreigner. Weeks later,
they admitted it had been carried out by a German-Moroccan suicide
bomber. Last year, a Spaniard was arrested in Basilan with bomb-making
materials. An Egyptian carrying \$19,000 in cash was also stopped on his
way to Basilan, according to Mujiv Hataman, the governor of the
autonomous Muslim region of the Philippines. Mr[. Hataman, who travels
by armored convoy, expressed worry that if the bombing raids intensify
in Jolo, militants will slip undetected into Basilan via small
boats]{.underline}. Already, [they travel among Indonesia, Malaysia and
the Philippines over poorly patrolled seas]{.underline}. "One problem
goes away and another starts," Mr. Hataman said. Interior Secretary
Eduardo Año has blamed the Jolo attack on an Indonesian couple, although
Indonesian investigators say there is little evidence. [Colonel Besana
acknowledged that a number of foreign fighters were hiding in the Jolo
hills, under the command of Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, who is believed to
have replaced Mr. Hapilon as the regional Islamic State
emir]{.underline}. The Islamic State's lure seems never far from the
surface in the southern Philippines. At a government ceremony in Basilan
where houses were awarded to former Abu Sayyaf rebels under a
long-gestating peace deal to bring autonomy to the Muslim south,
security was so heavy that they were outnumbered by Philippine soldiers.
Jem Habing, 22, a former Abu Sayyaf fighter who said he had joined at
age 11, like many children in his village, seemed noncommittal when
asked if he might rejoin. "They convinced me that if you die in battle,
you will be rewarded in the hereafter," he said. "They said it was the
right path."

MANILA (Reuters) - [The United States handed over six surveillance
drones to its ally the Philippines]{.underline} on Tuesday, as part of
efforts **[to boost its ability to tackle a growing threat from Islamist
militants and to respond to natural disasters]{.underline}**. The six
Boeing Insitu [ScanEagle drones, which have two cameras and can operate
for up to 24 hours on a single run]{.underline}, were financed through a
\$13.7 million grant from Washington\'s foreign military assistance
program. It follows the transfer of two single-engine surveillance
planes last year. **[The Philippines plans to deploy the drones for
surveillance against militants and pirates, and for surveying the
aftermath of disasters like typhoons, mudslides and

partner of the Philippines, with a decades-old treaty alliance and
numerous pacts that enable rotational deployment of U.S. troops and
annual joint exercises. However, ties have been tested by President

**[The US' decision to equip Southeast Asian countries with the
ScanEagle drones demonstrate the US's commitment to the security to its
allies and partners in the region,]{.underline}** says Defense News'
Mike Yeo. KUALA LUMPUR: [The recent announcement by the United States
that several Southeast Asian partner nations will receive unmanned
surveillance drones has garnered some interest, particularly given the
deterioration in relations between the US and China over security and
trade issues]{.underline}. The US Department of Defense (DoD) announced
last week that Insitu Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of aerospace giant
Boeing, had been awarded a US\$47 million contract for 34 ScanEagle
drones to Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam. [The US
government]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales ([FMS]{.underline})
[contract also provides for support to recipients, which includes spare
payloads, spare and repair parts, support equipment, tools, training,
technical services, and field service representatives, with work
expected to be completed in 2022]{.underline}. The drones will be
provided to these countries using funds from the US government, although
there are conflicting reports on whether these come under the DoD's
capacity building programme for partner nations or from the funding
under the maritime security initiative announced by the US in 2015. WHAT
IS THE SCANEAGLE? [The ScanEagle is an unarmed drone used for
surveillance and intelligence gathering roles. The current model, the
ScanEagle 2, which has a maximum take-off weight of 26kg, a length of
1.71m and wingspan of 3.11m, is classified as a small unmanned aircraft
system in industry parlance]{.underline}. Although unarmed, it can carry
a 5kg surveillance payload, comprising of electro-optic, infrared, and
high-resolution video cameras that enable the operator to track
stationary and moving targets. Performance-wise, the drone cruises at a
relatively modest cruise speed of 93 to 111 kmh and has a maximum
operating altitude of just below 6km although it has an ability to stay
in the air for up to 18 hours. [Manufacturer Insitu has developed a
pneumatic catapult unit to launch the ScanEagle,. At the end of a
mission, the drone is recovered by a Skyhook system developed by the
manufacturer whereby a wing-mounted hook catches onto a vertically
strung cable]{.underline}. The ScanEagle has been a popular choice,
being operated by militaries all across the globe, with Australia,
Lithuania, Pakistan and the United Kingdom among its users. It is also
in use by the Republic of Singapore Navy, which has launched from a
variety of ships including its missile corvettes. IS IT FOR USE IN THE
SOUTH CHINA SEA? The fact that all the countries in the recipient list
in the latest announcement have interests in the South China Sea, with
Indonesia being the only country that does not claim ownership of any of
the islands, features and rocks of the disputed Spratly or Paracels
groups, has not escaped notice. Also significant was the fact that [this
was the time American equipment with an overt military purpose will be
transferred to Vietnam since an American arms embargo, in place since
the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, was fully lifted in
2016]{.underline}. It was previously announced that Vietnam will receive
some US-built patrol boats, but these unarmed vessels were earmarked for
the coast guard and not the military. [The drones will assist the
recipient countries in improving Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) over
their territorial waters and exclusive economic zones.]{.underline} The
International Maritime Organisation defines MDA as the effective
understanding of all areas "on, under, relating to, adjacent to, or
bordering on a sea, ocean, or other navigable waterway" that could
impact the security, safety, economy, or environment of a country. [With
a lot having already been written about the importance of maritime-based
commerce and activities like fishing to regional economies, it goes
without saying how important MDA is to authorities in these littoral
states.]{.underline} However, the more cynical might be inclined to
think of **[this as the latest example of American assertiveness in the
region, particularly given ongoing US-China tensions, and the Trump
Administration's announced intentions to boost US weapons
exports]{.underline}**. But this would be a rather simplistic and
not-too-accurate way of seeing things. While there would be quite a lot
of capabilities one would need to bring to an outright confrontation
involving the dispute in the South China Sea or an assertion of presence
there, given China's increasingly powerful military, ScanEagles will not
be high on that list. In fact, **[it would be a risky proposition to use
them against any reasonably well-equipped opponent given its modest
performance specifications which would leave it vulnerable to air
defences.]{.underline}** MARITIME CHALLENGES FACING SOUTHEAST ASIAN
COUNTRIES Indeed, there are a whole host of MDA challenges that
recipient nations have to contend with, in not just the South China Sea
but also the Straits of Malacca, Sulu Sea and beyond. [The two main
issues that have been in the headlines are terrorism in southern
Philippines and piracy in the Straits of Malacca, Straits of Singapore
and South China Sea, as well as other maritime challenges Southeast Asia
littoral states need to confront including illegal fishing, human
trafficking, fuel theft, smuggling and other transnational
crime]{.underline}. Given that these nations have navies and coast
guards that are at best, stretched and at worst, severely
under-resourced, having a drone that can stay aloft for 18 hours is a
definite advantage in combating these myriad maritime challenges. Even a
small number of ScanEagles can make outsized contribution to improving
the MDA capabilities of these littoral states. **[The small operating
footprint of the ScanEagle is another key advantage, as it means that
the drone can be operated from any patch of open space or from onboard a
ship, negating the need for a runway]{.underline}**. **[Operating at
that altitude also means its sensors can see farther than that of a ship
sailing on the water's surface, improving the available coverage
area]{.underline}**. The capabilities of these modern optical sensors
were demonstrated clearly during last week's near-miss between a Russian
and US warship in the Philippine Sea, when the US navy released a number
of still photographs of the encounter that was grabbed from a video shot
from a sensor mounted onboard an aircraft. The photos were clear enough
to easily identify the ships, even though data on the image showed that
it was shot from a 3.35km altitude and 37km away. While the sensors
mounted on the ScanEagles are likely to be of more modest capabilities,
they would still nevertheless be useful for this intended purpose.
**[From a strategic perspective, the decision to equip Southeast Asian
recipient nations with the ScanEagles will also serve to demonstrate
that the US remains committed to the security to its allies and partners
in the region by taking a relatively inexpensive measure to make a
difference in a vital area, without looking like it was a move designed
to antagonise China]{.underline}**.

#### ScanEagle drones are key to intelligence gathering and checking china in the SCS

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - [The Trump administration has moved ahead with a
surveillance drone sale to four U.S. allies in the South China
Sea]{.underline} region as acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan
said Washington will no longer "tiptoe" around Chinese behavior in Asia.
**[The drones would afford greater intelligence gathering capabilities
potentially curbing Chinese activity in the region]{.underline}**.
Shanahan did not directly name China when making accusations of "actors"
destabilizing the region in a speech at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue
in Singapore on Saturday but went on to say **[the United States would
not ignore Chinese behavior]{.underline}**. The Pentagon announced on
Friday it would sell 34 ScanEagle drones, made by Boeing Co. to the
governments of Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam for a
total of \$47 million. [China claims almost all of the strategic South
China Sea and frequently lambastes the United States and its allies over
naval operations near Chinese-occupied islands]{.underline}. **[Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have competing
claims]{.underline}**. The Pentagon said Friday's sales included spare
and repair parts, support equipment, tools, training and technical
services and work on the equipment was expected to be completed by March
2022. As many as 12 unarmed drones and equipment would go to Malaysia
for about \$19 million. Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority
country would buy eight drones, the Philippines eight, and Vietnam six.
[In 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration rolled out a
long-awaited overhaul of U.S. arms export policy aimed at expanding
sales to allies, saying it would bolster the American defense industry
and create jobs at home]{.underline}. That initiative eased rules for
exporting some types of lethal as well as non-lethal U.S.-made drones to
potentially dozens more allies and partners. There is no armed version
of the ScanEagle, but Insitu, the division of Boeing that makes the
drone, also makes the RQ-21A Blackjack which is an optionally armed
drone used by U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

is acquiring eight (8) ScanEagle]{.underline} unmanned aerial vehicles
([UAVs]{.underline}) worth US\$ 9,633,665 from an aircraft maker's
subsidiary, under the United States Foreign Military Sales program.
According to a recent report, the contract was shared by the maker of

of the company to Southeast Asia by 2022]{.underline}. Other countries
in the region that also ordered the same type of UAV are Indonesia,
Malaysia and Vietnam. [Procurement inclusions Through the United States
Department of Defence, the company shared that the Philippines' order
provides for spare payloads, spare and repair parts, and support
equipment as well]{.underline}. Additionally, it also includes tools,
training, technical services and field service representatives. The
ScanEagle is a well-known tactical UAV and used principally for maritime
surveillance, with most of the procuring states intending to use it to
patrol their vast maritime waters. **[It characteristics include: 1.
Being launched through a catapult and being recovered using a skyhook 2.
Has more than 24 hours of flight endurance 3. Maximum speed of 148
kilometres per hour 4. Carries a maximum of 4.3 kg of fuel 5. This model
can perform a plethora of missions. These are: Intelligence 1.

surveillance drone will be a big boost to the military intelligence
capability of the Philippines, particularly in the South China
Sea]{.underline}**. The procurement of the eight UAVs will be an
addition to the current inventory that the Philippine Air Force has of
such aircraft. In March of 2018, the United States turned over six
ScanEagle 2 drones to the Philippine Department of Defence (DOD). The
six drones were acquired through a grant amounting to US\$ 13.2 million,
which was a part of the financial assistance provided by the United
States to its allies in Southeast Asia. These drones are currently being
operated by the 300th Air Intelligence and Security Wing of the
Philippine Air Force at Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan. **[This
province is the closest to the disputed portion of the South China Sea.
The ScanEagle 2 model has several functions and is capable of performing
a variety of missions. The missions include: 1. Internal security
operations 2. Counterterrorism 3. Reconnaissance 4. Patrol Aside from
boosting its maritime domain awareness, particularly in the South China
Sea, buying the UAVs will further boost the military's capability in
humanitarian assistance, disaster relief operations and
counter-terrorism capabilities.]{.underline}**

[China's pursuit of its illegal claims and]{.underline} its
[militarization]{.underline} of disputed features [in the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [threatens
long-standing]{.underline} [U.S.
interests](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/08/americas-freedom-of-navigation-operations-are-lost-at-sea/)
in the [freedom of the seas and the stability of the Indo-Pacific.
Successfully defending those interests requires that]{.underline}
China's neighbors, especially [the Philippines, continue to believe in
**U.S. staying power** and remain willing to **contest** Beijing's
demand for vast rights in contested waters. The political argument
against clarifying]{.underline} that [the MDT]{.underline} applies in
the South China Sea [is]{.underline} that doing so might invite
Philippine adventurism which could in turn drag the United States into
an [unnecessary conflict]{.underline} with China. [But with China's
militarization of the Spratlys and]{.underline} the [flood of Chinese
vessels]{.underline} to the region, [the costs of continued
ambiguity]{.underline} from the United States [**far outweigh** any
purported benefits. There **will be** another **violent incident**
between Chinese and Philippine vessels]{.underline} sooner or later, and
[it won't require any adventurism on the part of Manila]{.underline}; it
will just require the Philippines to continue sailing in its own waters.
Greater [clarity on the U.S. willingness to defend its ally would serve
as a **strong deterrent** against China escalating]{.underline} such an
incident. The only thing [continued U.S. ambiguity]{.underline} does is
[make it more likely that Manila will permanently shelve its claims in
deference to Beijing, dooming any U.S. hope of successfully defending a
free and open S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea
in the process. The [Trump]{.underline} administration [needs to
recognize this danger,]{.underline} understand that Manila's concerns
are not unreasonable, [and move]{.underline} carefully but quickly [to
preserve and ultimately strengthen the alliance. **First**]{.underline},
U.S. Defense and State Department [officials should communicate
privately to]{.underline} counterparts in [Manila that Washington
remains committed to the Cohen/Hubbard interpretation of Article
V]{.underline}. But [they should]{.underline} also [insist
that]{.underline} a [public affirmation]{.underline} of that commitment
[be accompanied by reassurances from Manila to help strengthen the
credibility of alliance,]{.underline} particularly regarding EDCA
implementation. Without a rotational presence in the Philippines, the
nearest land-based U.S. forces that could respond to an incident in the
South China Sea would be more than 1,000 miles away. With three
operational Chinese [air and naval
bases](https://amti.csis.org/chinas-big-three-near-completion/) in the
Spratlys, that makes the credibility of any current U.S. commitment
highly questionable. Unfortunately, Manila has been holding up
implementation of the agreement for nearly three years. Only one base
has seen any construction --- a disaster relief warehouse and a command
and control center --- with the same planned at one and possibly two
other locations. President [Duterte has made clear that he doesn't want
U.S. prepositioning of defense equipment]{.underline} at any of the
locations and rotational deployments seem unlikely for the foreseeable
future. [That must change. **Second**, if an agreement can be reached to
exchange EDCA implementation for a public clarification of the treaty
commitment]{.underline}, Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo should do
so]{.underline} at the first opportunity. This could be during either
Congressional budget testimony this spring in Washington or, even
better, a trip to Manila. [That clarification]{.underline} would need to
be carefully calibrated. It [should reaffirm]{.underline} the
[Cohen/Hubbard]{.underline} policy that an attack on Philippine armed
forces, planes, or vessels in the South China Sea are covered by Article
V. It need not say that the Philippine-claimed islets in the Spratlys
are covered but [should affirm that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [opposes any attempts to unilaterally change the
status of occupation at the nine features]{.underline} currently
administered by Manila. [It should also explicitly state that Washington
does not recognize Chinese jurisdiction over Scarborough
Shoal]{.underline} and would act in concert with Manila to oppose any
Chinese construction on the feature. And [**third**, the
U.S.]{.underline} government [should take the opportunity to inform
Manila of an enhanced **security assistance package** to help
build]{.underline} the [capacity]{.underline} of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines [and propose]{.underline} talks to formulate
[new]{.underline} guidelines for [Philippine-U.S. defense
cooperation]{.underline} modeled to better operationalize the alliance,
much as the 2015 [revised
guidelines](http://www.mod.go.jp/e/d_act/anpo/) have done for the
U.S.-Japan alliance. It would be easy to dismiss the concerns of
Secretary Lorenzana as empty rhetoric. We believe [bold action to
preserve the U.S.-Philippine alliance is not only an imminent
requirement but one that will serve the larger objectives
of]{.underline} the Trump administration's [Indo-Pacific
strategy]{.underline}. While assuaging Manila's concerns, [Washington
could better position itself in Southeast Asia and
strengthen]{.underline} U.S. [S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea [policy. But it would also begin to **modernize** an
alliance that has suffered from too much **complacency** on both sides
and which has fallen behind the times as a result]{.underline}. The
alternative, a diminution and possible [**severing of the alliance**,
would cost the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [at least as
much as it would the Philippines]{.underline}.

[A storm is brewing in America's oldest security alliance in the
Indo-Pacific and the administration **needs to act quickly to head it
off**]{.underline}. On December 20, [Philippine Secretary of National
Defense Delfin Lorenzana called for a review of the provisions of the
1951 Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT]{.underline}) between Washington and
Manila. A week later, he confirmed that Philippine government lawyers
had been tasked to study ways to "maintain it, strengthen it, or scrap
it." [The primary reason for this review is what Lorenzana called
**America's "ambivalence" about whether the treaty applies in the South
China Sea**]{.underline}, where Philippine troops and facilities are
under threat from an increasingly assertive China. In a Jan. 8
interview, Lorenzana reiterated [that if America won't clarify the
treaty's scope, then **scrapping it altogether is "an option."** That
would be a **severe blow to U.S. interests in the
Indo-Pacific**]{.underline} and a largely self-inflicted wound by
Washington. Lorenzana and the defense establishment in Manila are
unlikely to demand actual amendments to the MDT. Doing so, even if the
negotiations were successful, would require ratification by the U.S. and
Philippine senates, which seems unlikely in the current political
climates in both capitals. What they seem to want is a public
clarification of U.S. policy regarding the application of the treaty to
the South China Sea, hopefully accompanied by new guidelines to
modernize and operationalize the treaty for the current threat
environment. [Given Washington's interests in countering
Beijing's]{.underline} illegal claims and militarization of the South
China Sea [and the]{.underline} continued [utility of the
U.S.-Philippine alliance, Manila's concerns]{.underline} should be seen
[as entirely reasonable]{.underline} and Washington should move quickly
to resolve them. American Uncertainty Articles IV and V of the MDT
obligate both parties to "act to meet the common dangers" of "an armed
attack on the metropolitan territory of either of the Parties, or on the
island territories under its jurisdiction in the Pacific or on its armed
forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific." But there is no
longer any real threat of invasion of the metropolitan Philippines. The
only external threat to the country is to its holdings and citizens in
the South China Sea. If the treaty doesn't apply there, then Filipinos
might understandably view it as an anachronism. As a result[, Philippine
officials have sought clarity for decades on whether the United States
considers the islands and reefs they occupy in the South China Sea to
fall within the scope of this commitment.]{.underline} The issue became
more urgent in 2012 when China seized Scarborough Shoal from the
Philippines despite a botched U.S. attempt to negotiate a mutual
withdrawal of vessels. In early 2014, President Barack Obama reaffirmed
that the Senkaku Islands administered by Japan in the East China Sea
were covered by Article V of the U.S.-Japan treaty, which has
nearly-identical language to the U.S.-Philippine pact. But during a
visit to Manila as part of the same trip, he refused to give a similar
clarification for the Philippines. Instead he insisted that the U.S.
commitment to the alliance was "ironclad" --- an emotive phrase that
purposely dodged the question. The term "ironclad" has since become a
mantra repeated by every U.S. official asked about treaty application
for the last five years, most recently by Amb. Sung Kim on Dec. 19, to
the chagrin of many Filipinos. Whether the nine Philippine-held features
in the Spratly Islands fall under the scope of the treaty's Article V is
unclear. For one thing, they were occupied by the Philippines after the
treaty was ratified and the United States takes no position on their
ultimate sovereignty. The relative strength of Philippine claims to the
islands compared to those of others like China or Vietnam is unclear,
and the question can only be legally decided by direct negotiation or
arbitration. As with other regional territorial disputes like those over
the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands or the Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo/Takeshima), the
United States steers clear of murky historical questions and insists
only that the disputes be resolved peacefully and in accordance with
international law. [There is also an open question about whether the
reference in the U.S.-Philippine treaty to "island territories under its
jurisdiction" sets a higher bar than the U.S.-Japan treaty,]{.underline}
which uses the language "territories under the administration of Japan."
Scarborough Shoal, which is not part of the Spratlys, is a special case.
U.S. officials concluded during the 1930s that it was legally acquired
by the United States from Spain in the 1900 Treaty of Washington. It was
then transferred to the newly independent Philippines in 1946, which
Washington continued to recognize into the 1980s when it used the area
as a bombing range with Manila's permission. But during the last 30
years, successive U.S. administrations have ignored or forgotten this
historical position and instead adopted the same neutrality toward
Scarborough as toward the Spratlys, believing it grants U.S. policy more
flexibility. But quibbling over whether the islands and reefs themselves
are covered by the treaty is unnecessary. Article IV of the Mutual
Defense Treaty specifies that "an armed attack in the Pacific Area on
either of the Parties" would trigger a common response. Article V
specifies that this includes not only attacks on the metropolitan
territory or islands of the parties, but also "its armed forces, public
vessels or aircraft in the Pacific." In 1998, Defense Secretary William
Cohen affirmed that the United States "considers the South China Sea to
be part of the Pacific Area" and therefore any attack on Philippine
"armed forces, public vessels or aircraft" there would be covered by
Article V. Ambassador to the Philippines Thomas Hubbard reiterated this
in a letter to the Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs in 1999.
Unfortunately, that was the last time any U.S. official publicly took a
stance on the issue. And [**that silence has been deafening** in the
wake of developments in the South China Sea and the explicit commitments
made to Japan.]{.underline} The View from Manila Secretary [Lorenzana
has been a champion of the alliance and a **moderating influence** on
the anti-American prejudices of]{.underline} President Rodrigo [Duterte.
That he is **so exasperated and uncertain about Washington's willingness
to follow through on its treaty commitment should be deeply
concerning**]{.underline} and seen as reflective of widespread anxieties
in the traditionally pro-American Philippine defense establishment. U.S.
policymakers and experts might be tempted to believe that the
Philippines has too much to lose to move forward with the review, much
less abrogate the treaty. But from Manila's perspective, gambling now
that a treaty review will elicit a straight answer from Washington
regarding the South China Sea is a smarter bet than gambling later on
whether the United States will come through if China resorts to force.
[During the last decade of American waffling on its treaty commitment,
the threats to Philippine assets in the South China Sea have increased
considerably]{.underline}. Beijing has built and militarized seven
artificial islands in the disputed Spratlys. It has used these to extend
its air, naval, coast guard, and paramilitary presence throughout the
South China Sea, harassing Filipino fishermen, aircraft, and resupply
missions to Philippine-held islets and reefs, including the marine
detachment on the Sierra Madre, a Philippine Navy vessel purposely run
aground at Second Thomas Shoal two decades ago.

### Solvency

#### MDT review will [strengthen]{.underline} U.S.-Philippine relations

**Heydarian '19** (Richard, Manila-based academic, columnist and author,
political science professor at De La Salle University, "A chance to
renew the US-Philippines defense alliance," Nikkei Asian Review,
1/11/19,
<https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/A-chance-to-renew-the-US-Philippines-defense-alliance>,
JL)

[Amid the steady restoration of its frayed ties Washington, Manila has
made a surprise call for a review of the bilateral 1951 Mutual Defense
Treaty, the foundation stone of the Philippines\' security.]{.underline}
At first sight, the shock announcement that Philippine Defense Secretary
Delfin Lorenzana made in late December, seems very odd. Not only does
the Philippines face its biggest potential threat of the last 70 years
in the shape of an expansionist China. But the move comes from a
ministry that has until now been staunch in resisting pressure from
Beijing-friendly President Rodrigo Duterte to undermine Manila\'s
long-standing military ties with Washington. The Philippine defense
chief, who spent more than a decade as a diplomat in Washington, made
clear that scrapping the alliance altogether is definitely an option.
The treaty allows for unilateral nullification of the agreement within a
year of notice. But [Lorenzana\'s actions may be more subtle than they
seem. **He is almost certainly not seeking to break the alliance.** But
by putting the possibility on the table he has a chance of forcing the
pro-China lobby around Duterte out]{.underline} into the open \-- and
pressing these officials to state clearly what kind of security
arrangement they seek and how will this protect the country\'s vital
interests, particularly in the South China Sea. [If they balk at the
prospect of saying bluntly that they would rather trust China than the
U.S**., this will undermine their arguments and end up strengthening the
traditional ties.**]{.underline} At the same time, such a [strategy
might squeeze some concessions out of Washington to improve what is now
a vague mutual defense accord.]{.underline} Of course, Lorenzana is
running risks given the unpredictability of both Duterte and U.S.
President Donald Trump. [But, he is right to try \-- because the
**current deal with Washington desperately needs a much-needed
boost.**]{.underline} Even the pro-U.S. elements in Manila share with
the pro-China officials a lingering resentment over America\'s
ambivalence over the exact extent of its commitment to its Southeast
Asian ally, particularly in light of the South China Sea disputes.
Lorenzana is right in thinking that an upgrade is required for the
alliance to reflect 21st century geopolitical realities, namely China\'s
rise and the need for greater American economic engagement with the
region. [In exchange for the greater access to strategic Philippine
bases bordering the South China Sea, Washington should make clear
whether its willing to assist the Philippines in an event of
contingencies in the disputed waters.]{.underline} Moreover, the [two
allies should finalize economic agreements, including a free trade deal,
to revitalize their relations more broadly.]{.underline} For decades,
Washington has equivocated over the parameters of its treaty commitments
to the Philippines. As the South China Sea disputes have escalated,
pitting the Philippines against other claimant states, the issue has
gained greater urgency. Manila\'s anxieties go back to two occasions,
namely the Mischief Reef (1995) and Scarborough Shoal (2012) crises,
when China muscled out the Philippines without any response from
Washington from two features within the Philippines\' exclusive economic
zone. In both cases, the U.S. professed neutrality and called on the
parties to resolve the disputes in accordance with international law.
These concerns about the U.S.\'s commitment have multiplied since
Duterte and Trump took power, with the Philippines leader improving
bilateral relations with China while the U.S. president has, repeatedly
raised doubts on America\'s ties with allies. There are two problems
with the Mutual Defense Treaty. First, it does not guarantee automatic
American assistance in an emergency. According to the treaty, each party
\"would act to meet the common dangers \[in their area of jurisdiction\]
in accordance with its constitutional processes.\" So, the U.S.
Congress, for instance, would have a say on whether the U.S. should
assist the Philippines in a conflict. The second major problem is the
exact scope of American commitments. According to the treaty, mutual
defense applies in the event of \"an armed attack on the metropolitan
territory of either of the Parties, or on the island territories under
its jurisdiction in the Pacific or on its armed forces, public vessels
or aircraft in the Pacific.\" Since the 1970s, however, Americans have
equivocated over whether Philippine-occupied and -claimed territories in
the South China Sea are covered. During his 2014 visit to the
Philippines, former U.S. President Barack Obama refused to clarify
whether the Treaty would apply in an event of conflict between Manila
and Beijing in the South China Sea. He dismissively described the
disputed Scarborough Shoal and other Philippine-claimed territories as a
\"bunch of rocks.\" In contrast, the Obama administration made clear the
Senkaku/Diaoyu islands, disputed by Tokyo and Beijing, are covered by
the 1951 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, which says that U.S. forces
stationed in Japan, \"may be utilized to contribute to the maintenance
of international peace and security in the Far East and to the security
of Japan against armed attack from without.\" No wonder then, Lorenzana
cited the \"ambivalent\" attitude of Americans as a pretext for a treaty
review. He has also said there were questions on whether the Treaty was
\"still relevant to our security?\" rather than solely \"the interest of
other nations.\" However, a [review of the MDT should not serve as an
exit strategy but an opportunity to upgrade the alliance, whereby
Washington would clarify that its commitments]{.underline} cover
currently Philippine-occupied land features in the South China Sea. [In
exchange for greater American assurances, the Philippines should
consider granting access to bases near the disputed area]{.underline},
namely the Basa and Bautista air bases, [and allow American warships to
utilize Philippine ports during the Freedom of Navigation Operations
tours, which are crucial to maintaining access in important
waterways.]{.underline} Washington\'s newly-passed Asia Reassurance
Initiative Act (ARIA), which allocates an additional \$1.5 billion for
American security cooperation initiatives in the region, can go a long
way in boosting bilateral cooperation. But upgrading the alliance should
go beyond security cooperation and extend to the proposed
U.S.-Philippine Trade and Investment Framework Agreement as well as
greater American investments in Philippine infrastructure under the
recently-passed \$60-billion Better Utilization of Investments Leading
to Development (BUILD) initiative. None of these amendments, however,
should prevent the Philippines from maintaining stable relations with
China, which has offered large-scale commercial deals. Instead, they
would place the Philippines in a stronger position to protect its
interests in dealings with the Asian juggernaut. [Far from undermining
the century-old alliance, **the review of the MDT can serve as a
springboard to upgrade Philippine-U.S. partnership for the 21st
century.**]{.underline} This should be Lorenzana\'s priority. And
Duterte\'s.

#### Russia fill-in expands spheres of influence and military presence in Southeast Asia

JL)

Russia's "hard" power is generally well-understood. President Vladimir
Putin has ensured this is the case, particularly through his proclivity
to showcase Russian strength in Ukraine and Syria. And who could forget
Russia's arsenal of nuclear weapons? Not Donald Trump: just last
weekend, Washington cited Russian missile provocations as the reason the
US was suspending compliance of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty. On the other hand, new data from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) suggests a rather
different [dimension of Russian power: being the key provider of arms
and military technology to the Asia-Pacific region. This "soft"
power]{.underline} is much less obvious than Russian military movements
but [carries its own array of geopolitical consequences.]{.underline}
SIPRI tracks the world's largest arms producers (a group it terms the
"Top 100"), and their sales of weapons and military technology. In its
year-end roundup for 2018, it announced that Russia had overtaken the
United Kingdom to become the second largest arms producer behind the
United States. Russian arms giants accounted for about 10% of the Top
100's total arms sales last year -- about \$38 billion. The data
reflects that [Russia's strong year-on-year growth in arms
sales]{.underline} (up 8.5% from 2017) [is driven by Asian
states.]{.underline} South and Southeast Asia now account for over 60%
of Russia's total arms exports. [By most estimates, Russia is the
largest arms exporter for the whole Asia-Pacific region.]{.underline}
The [role of smaller Southeast Asian states in this regional trend is
easily underestimated.]{.underline} Significant attention (not to
mention American sanctions) was drawn when India and China each
purchased Russian S-400 air defence systems, in deals worth \$5.5 and
\$3 billion respectively. These high-profile agreements between global
powers belie the fact [that Southeast Asian states purchase more Russian
arms than India and China put together.]{.underline} Take Vietnam, which
placed an arms order for Russian weapons last year worth \$1 billion, or
the [Philippines, both the purchaser of Russian heavy weapons and the
recipient of weapons and vehicles donated by Moscow.]{.underline} It is
especially noteworthy that the Philippines planned a deal in direct
breach of American sanctions, given their longstanding security ties
with the US. Approximating the cause of this Southeast Asian security
spending is not terribly difficult. China remains an aggressive and
territorial presence in the region, quite willing to use military force
to intimidate the smaller states dotted around the South China Sea.
However, [Southeast Asian countries are also understandably wary
about]{.underline} another threat: [terrorism]{.underline} is an ongoing
security issue driving states to acquire superior hardware and
equipment. This growing web of [arms deals strengthens Russia's "soft"
power by helping bring Asian states into Moscow's sphere of
influence]{.underline}. Weapons agreements should be understood as
contributors to a broader military relationship, as opposed to discrete
transactions (one does not buy S-400 air defence systems at the
supermarket). [Russia is increasingly taking part in joint military
exercises with its Southeast Asian security customers]{.underline}, for
instance. The preponderance of Russian arms in Asia has brought its
share of unintended consequences. Experts deem [Southeast Asia a
"crossroads" for small arms smuggling and weapons
trafficking.]{.underline} To take just one example, United Nations
estimates suggest there are more than 1,100,000 unregistered guns in the
Philippines. 26 people are killed every day by small arms, a number on
the rise since President Rodrigo Duterte assumed office with a message
of outright support for vigilante murder. While it is inherently
difficult to quantify the number of Russian arms in this deluge of
illegal arms, Southeast Asian states have a sketchy track record for
maintaining control over foreign weapons. This uncertainty aligns
dangerously with the rise of extremism and terrorism in the region. Some
journalists have even raised concerns that groups such as ISIS are
receiving weapons trafficked through Southeast Asian hubs such as
Thailand and Malaysia. The Malaysian Border Security Agency
director-general has not exactly quelled fears, going on the record to
admit "it's not easy to detect a person attempting to sneak in weapons."
In any case, [the rise and rise of Russia as a regional arms giant is of
significant consequence to the entire Asia-Pacific.]{.underline} The
Kremlin's export drive in South and Southeast Asia represents an ongoing
expansion of Russian influence. [As regional tensions around the South
China Sea continue to build, we should well expect more states to join
the queue in buying Russian weapons.]{.underline} Each arms deal helps
solidify ties between Moscow and its customers (particularly those
fearful of an expansionist China). Leveraging national arms production
to build Russian "soft" power is fast becoming a strategic gold mine for
the Kremlin.

from the US, it started looking for **cheaper** and **better**
arms]{.underline}. "We\'ll buy if we think we need that kind of
particular... But [I\'d like to say to the Americans and to the
officials]{.underline} \-- [in Washington, when you deprived us of the
arms, we started going around scouting for cheaper and better arms. And
there were **contracts already**]{.underline}, memorandum of intent \--
intent to buy something like that. [So we will not impair
that]{.underline} obligations," he said. He said [he could not **abandon
deals** signed by the Philippines with Russia and China]{.underline},
the [two countries that provided assistance to the Philippines
especially when the Marawi siege took place in]{.underline} May
[2017.]{.underline} "When we needed, [in the hour of our
need,]{.underline} we needed the arms, [Russia and China gave it to us

MANILA (Reuters) - [Thousands of assault rifles and helmets were among
the military gear Russia donated to the Philippines in a bid to widen
its arms market in Southeast Asia at a time when Manila is seeking to
diversify weapons systems, officials said on Wednesday. Manila received
about 5,000 Kalashnikov rifles]{.underline}, 5,000 steel [helmets, about
a million rounds of ammunition for the rifles and 20 army
trucks]{.underline} in a ceremony attended by President Rodrigo Duterte,
who also toured one of five visiting Russian warships. [The gift came a
day after Russia and the Philippines signed two military pacts,
including a sales contract with]{.underline} Rosoboronexport, [a
state-owned vendor of Russian defense equipment]{.underline}. "We are
looking at acquiring some equipment for humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief operations, but there are no specifics yet," Defense
Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told Reuters. "We are still discussing."
Lorenzana said the Rosoboronexport contract was not a sales deal but
signaled the Philippines' intention to acquire small arms, vehicles and
special equipment for disaster operations. But the Philippines' biggest
source of arms, the United States, was not worried at the prospect of
equipment donated by its rivals China and Russia. "I don't attach very
much significance to it, some trucks or guns being dropped off to a
country that's fighting terrorists right now," U.S. Defense Secretary
Jim Mattis told reporters on the plane to Bangkok. "It's a sovereign
decision by the Philippines," he added. "So it's not a big
issue\...other nations are coming to their help." The United States and
China dominate regional arms trade. Since 2000, the United States has
donated close to \$1 billion worth of military equipment to the
Philippines, ranging from surveillance planes, drones and boats to small
arms. [China, which promised to donate a third shipment of small
arms]{.underline} after a meeting on Wednesday between Lorenzana and his
Chinese counterpart, General Chang Wanquan, [has already given the
Philippines about \$7 million in small arms. The deals with the
Philippines will allow Russia to **expand its arms market in the
region**]{.underline}, said another senior Philippine official, who
declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media.
The [**Philippines is now open to buying Russian arms** as Manila
cultivates closer ties with Moscow]{.underline}, he added, particularly
[as the military looks to diversify its equipment, reining in costs
while maintaining quality. "Moscow has been offering to sell
arms]{.underline} to us since the mid-1990s and they are willing to
barter guns for bananas," he said, adding that [Russia was selling
fighters, helicopters and submarines to the Philippines.]{.underline}

Cooperation in 2019," USNI News, 10/3/18,

[U.S. and Philippine military leaders pledged increased cooperation and
collaboration in 2019 **despite past anti-American
rhetoric**]{.underline} from the Pacific nation's president and his
stated desire to foster closer ties with China. When the 2018 Mutual
Defense Board and Security Engagement Board (MDB-SEB) was signed late
last week by U.S. Indo-Pacific Command commander Adm. Phil Davidson and
Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Gen. Carlito
Galvez, the ceremony celebrated continuing cooperation dating back to
the end of World War II. [The event also sent an **unsubtle hint to
China that the U.S.-Philippine military alliance still
exists**]{.underline}, Greg Poling, the director of the Asia Maritime
Transparency Initiative at the Center for International and Strategic
Studies, told USNI News. "[It does send the message everything is on an
even keel, the alliance remains strong]{.underline}," Poling said. "The
big concern has been what does the election of Rodrigo Duterte as
president of the Philippines mean to the alliance. He's unabashedly
anti-American, unabashedly pro-Chinese." After his 2016 election,
Duterte's first trip was to China. He also threatened to prohibit the
Philippine military from taking part in large-scale military exercises
with the U.S., Poling said. But since then, [Philippine military and
civilian officials appear to have impressed the importance of military
exercises, exchanges, and cooperation with the U.S. to combat terrorism
and provide disaster relief]{.underline}, Poling said. As part of the
MDB-SEB[, the U.S. and the Philippines agreed to conduct 281 security
cooperation activities in 2019]{.underline}, according to a statement
from INDO-PACOM. That figure is about **[20 more than what will be held
this year]{.underline}**. It's hard to say what this increase means,
Poling said, since these activities include everything from major
large-scale exercises to small training opportunities and meetings
between mid-level government officials. The MDB started in 1958, and the
SEB in 2006. Both boards are used to coordinate defense and security
cooperation between the militaries of both nations, according to the
INDO-PACOM release. [However, the **scope of the U.S./Philippine
partnership has expanded beyond basic security cooperation**. The recent
Balikatan exercise focused on disaster relief]{.underline}. And earlier
this year the [Philippine military was able to retake control of Marawi
with assistance from U.S. special forces]{.underline}, Poling said.
Marawi, a city in the southern Philippines, had for nearly half a year
been under siege by fighters aligned with the Islamic State. Admiral
Philip Davidson, Commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command
(Indo-PACOM), and Gen. Carlito Galvez, Chief of Staff of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines receive honors at Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City,

publicly stated his preference to align with China, Poling said [many in
the Philippines and the region remained wary of China's threatening and
bullying actions to assert control over shipping lanes and fishing
rights in the South China Sea. The military alliance between the U.S.
and Philippines was never really in danger]{.underline}, Poling said.
But the [**public ceremony renewing the annual military agreements**
does let everyone know cooperation between the two nations
continues.]{.underline} "To Beijing, it's sending the message: however
close you might be to the current populist president of the Philippines,
[you haven't really undercut **the foundation of the alliance, which was
there before Duterte and will be there after Duterte**,]{.underline}"
Poling said.

This is particularly worrying because [the Philippine defense ministry
has until now been a reliable proponent of the U.S.
alliance,]{.underline} often in contravention of Duterte's efforts to
distance Manila from Washington. Where to go from here? The [Philippines
remains an important ally for the U.S. Access to military facilities
there is crucial for a variety of reasons, from combating
terrorism]{.underline} in Southeast Asia [to ensuring a favorable
balance of power in the South China Sea, and from rapidly responding to
natural disasters]{.underline} to [ensuring an effective American
forward defense perimeter]{.underline}. Simply **[giving up on the
alliance should not be an option.]{.underline}** In an effort to return
the alliance to a firmer footing, the U.S. should pursue three parallel
lines of effort. First, it needs a strategy for the South China Sea
designed to dissuade China and others from engaging in destabilizing
behavior and to advance peaceful outcomes to disputes. American
officials should explain how such a strategy sits within the Trump
administration's broader vision of a "free and open" Indo-Pacific, and
make the case that, although it has shifted to a more competitive
approach to relations with China, it has done so in order to avoid open
conflict over the longer term. Washington wants a conflict with Beijing
no more than Manila does. Second, the U.S. should launch a sustained
effort to remind the Philippines of the many benefits it receives from
the alliance --- from territorial defense to assistance in combating
terrorism and support for military modernization. The broader bilateral
relationship is crucial for advancing the Philippines' economic
development. This campaign should include policymakers, the legislature
and society at large. Third, the U.S. should be investigating whether
Philippine skepticism of the treaty is predominantly a product of
Duterte's anti-American animus or reflective of a broader shift. If
there is a broader movement at work --- public polling, which
consistently shows friendly attitudes toward America and the opposite
toward China, suggests otherwise --- Washington will have to begin
grappling with the prospect of a slow unwinding of the alliance. [Such
an unwinding would make it far easier for China to dominate the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, [to send armed
vessels and aircraft into the Western Pacific unchallenged]{.underline},
[to **threaten the U.S. territories** of Guam and Hawaii]{.underline}
[and to send **nuclear-armed submarines** on patrol]{.underline} from
their base on Hainan island, at the western end of China's South China
Sea coast. [It would likewise **hamper American efforts to counter
terrorism** in Southeast Asia]{.underline}. Both countries should seek
to avoid such an outcome, but it appears that the Duterte administration
may be heading down that path. The alliance crisis that Pompeo hoped to
avert may be upon us.

high-level public statements in case of a crisis. But in the meantime,

#### [Only American clarity]{.underline} solves Filipino assurance

Upgrading the Alliance [The second reason for lack of appreciation of
the bilateral alliance centers around the need for **greater clarity**
and **vitality**. **[One major area of concern]{.mark}**, particularly
**[in the Philippines, is the lack of American clarity on the extent of
its commitment]{.mark}** in the event of conflict in the South China
Sea.]{.underline} Granted, the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty, particularly
article 4, doesn't indicate an automatic military response to any
potential aggression by a third power against the Philippines over
disputed land features in the area. Yet, [the treaty commitment to
consult in the event of threats to the Philippines vastly understates
the strategic, economic, political, ideological, and personal factors
that would be part of the calculus in Washington's
response.]{.underline} As Randall Schriver, assistant secretary of
defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, underscored during a
visit to the Philippines earlier this year, "We'll be a good ally. . . .
There should be no misunderstanding or lack of clarity on the spirit and
the nature of our commitment. . . . We'll help the Philippines respond
accordingly \[to any external threat\]." Nonetheless, [**[it's]{.mark}**
perhaps **[high time for Washington]{.mark} under** the **Trump**
administration **[to provide greater assurance about its willingness to
deter]{.mark}** (i) any [aggressive action against Filipino personnel
stationed across Philippine]{.mark}-occupied [land]{.mark} features as
well as (ii) reclamation and militarization of the Philippine-claimed
Scarborough Shoal, which lies not too far from the Subic and Clark
bases. The Duterte administration has made it clear that these are its
**"red lines" in the S**outh **C**hina **S**ea, **despite its warming
ties with China**, thus the importance of American commitment to aid its
Southeast Asian ally if and when push comes to shove. **[A strong
statement about U.S. support]{.mark} for defense of the Philippines
under assault [would go a long way in reassuring Manila of the
dependability of its alliance]{.mark} with America**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [[greater U.S. clarity would reassure the Philippines]{.mark}
as it seeks to negotiate a mutually satisfactory modus vivendi with
China in the South China Sea]{.underline}. To be clear, Manila doesn't
seek to drag American into unwanted, destructive wars, but [it needs
strong support if it's to hold its own in ongoing dealings with
Beijing.]{.underline} This is fundamentally about a "diplomacy of
dissuasion and deterrence" amid Chinese maritime assertiveness. After
all, American military support constitutes essential deterrence against
external aggression against the Philippines. And just as Japanese
support, port calls, and exchanges with the Philippines increase, so,
too, can the further operationalization of the Enhanced Defense
Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between the United States and the
Philippines bolster deterrence and defense. It's important for Manila
and Washington to discuss the possibility of granting greater access to
American troops in strategically located bases, namely the Bautista and
Basa airbases, which are close to the disputed land features in the
South China Sea. This wouldn't only ensure maximum interoperability
between the two allies, but also it goes without saying that greater
American military presence could serve as a much-needed check on China's
creeping maritime incursion into Philippine waters.

#### US ambiguity over the MDT is the catalyst for the Philippines' pivot toward China

[Do we still have a Cold War today? Is \[our alliance with the United
States\] still relevant to our security? Maybe not," declared Philippine
defense secretary Delfin Lorenzana]{.underline} in a press briefing at
the Malacanang presidential palace, putting into question the fate of
one of the oldest alliances in the world. [[The Philippine defense chief
even went so far as **confirming the possibility of abrogating the**
]{.mark}**U.S.-Philippine** 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty
(**[MDT]{.mark}**) if this were "in the interest of the nation, \[rather
than\] the interest of other nations."]{.underline} Under the MDT, each
party has the prerogative to dispense with the treaty, which will take
effect a year after the issuance of notice of abrogation. [The review
process could begin later this year under the supervision of a special
commission]{.underline}, the Philippine defense chief told the author.
On one hand, it seems like a sound, timely decision in light of evolving
geopolitical dynamics in the region, most especially the rise of China
as the most preeminent power in Asia. On the other hand, [**[it's a
double-edged sword]{.mark}**, since it can serve both as a springboard
to upgrade the bilateral alliance but also an opportunity for
Beijing-friendly elements in Manila to lobby for strategic neutrality
and downgrade of Philippine-U.S. relations]{.underline}. Thus, it's of
paramount importance for the "alliance managers," namely those who
advocated a stronger U.S.-Philippine partnership, to lobby for deeper
and more comprehensive bilateral military cooperation. In particular,
[it's high time for Washington to stop equivocating on the precise
coordinates of its alliance commitments to the Philippines, a phenomenon
that has irked even the greatest friends of the bilateral
alliance.]{.underline} [[What's happening in the Philippines is a
telltale of **growing regional anxiety of American strategic
reliability**.]{.underline}]{.mark} After all, [the Southeast Asian
country is widely considered as the most pro-American nation on earth.
**[What's at stake is no less than American leadership in
Asia]{.mark}**, since **[any]{.mark}** major **[downgrade in
U.S.-Philippine alliance could send shockwaves across the
region]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Bolt from the Blue [The announcement took
almost everyone by surprise for at least three reasons. First of all it
came from no less than Lorenzana himself, a]{.underline} fiercely
independent-minded former general and [long-time Washington-based
defense attaché.]{.underline} Familiar with the inner workings of
Capitol Hill, he played a central role in securing hundreds of millions
of dollars in compensation for World War II Filipino veterans, who
fought alongside Americans against Imperial Japan. Widely seen as the
"Mattis of the Philippines," though he has been more secure in his
position so far, [Lorenzana has been the primary bedrock of reassurance
and sobriety amidst Philippine president]{.underline} Rodrigo [Duterte's
constant stream of anti-Western tirades,]{.underline} contradictory
policy statements, and overtly China-friendly pronouncements.
Operationally, Lorenzana has made sure that Duterte's apprehensions
towards the West don't significantly undermine long-standing defense
cooperation between the Philippines and traditional allies, most
especially the United States. Under his conscientious watch, annual
U.S.-Philippine joint military exercises have expanded in scope and
frequency, counter-terror and counter-narcotics cooperation have been
better than ever, while previously cancelled joint war games (during
Duterte's first year in office) in the South China Sea (with a view
towards the Chinese threat) have also been restored. Crucially, the
Filipino defense chief, which was previously tapped as a prospective
ambassador to Washington, also closely coordinated the much-celebrated
repatriation of the famous Balagiga Bells to the Philippines with the
Pentagon during former Defense Secretary James Mattis' tenure. And this
brings us to the second reason, which is the seemingly odd timing of the
announcement. The return of the bells, taken by occupying American
forces during the colonial period from a Philippine church, was a major
sticking point in Duterte's relations with Washington. In fact, the
Filipino president warmly welcomed the move, setting the stage for a
much-delayed visit to the White House likely by the second half of this
year, according to senior advisors who spoke to the author on the
condition of anonymity. And finally, the review is taking place just as
China begins to consolidate the foundations of a fully-operational Air
Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the South China Sea, turning
gigantic reclaimed islands into military fortresses with
state-of-the-art weaponries, airstrips and facilities capable of hosting
large numbers of personnel and engineers. Thus, one would expect the
Philippines to double down rather than put into doubt its alliance with
Washington. Overcoming Commitment Issues It's highly likely clear-eyed
Filipino strategists hope to leverage the review process to upgrade,
rather than abrogate, the alliance. [For far too long, [Washington has
maintained]{.mark} so-called " strategic ambiguity " over the precise
parameters of its commitments to the Philippines' security. Over time,
what we have seen is **[more ambiguity than strategy]{.mark},** since
the Southeast Asian country has had to deal with the frightening
prospect of Chinese domination of Philippine waters sans any significant
assistance from Washington.]{.underline} After all, there are two
fundamental problems with the treaty, which has been a constant source
of frustration among Filipino defense officials. The first one concerns
lack of what I call "temporal automaticity," namely absence of an
assurance of expedient intervention in an event of a major contingency.
[[According to the]{.mark} Article VI of the [MDT, each party
"would]{.mark} act to [meet]{.mark} the common [dangers]{.mark} \[in
their area of jurisdiction\] [in accordance with its
constitution]{.mark}al processes \[author's own emphasis\] ." [This
means that any American administration will]{.mark} likely [have to rely
on **Congressional approval** , which]{.mark}, in turn, [may delay,
derail and complicate]{.mark} the prospect [of military intervention in
behalf of the Philippines]{.mark},' especially if it involves a major
adversary and amid the growing anti-war sentiments in
America.]{.underline} The second problem concerns the lack of clarity on
the 'spatial scope' of the treaty. According to the Article V of the
MDT, "an armed attack on the metropolitan territory of either of the
Parties, or on the island territories under its jurisdiction in the
Pacific or on its armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the
Pacific." Yet, neither the treaty nor policy pronouncements by
Washington have clarified what precisely constitutes "metropolitan"
territories of the Philippines as well as "island territories under its
jurisdiction". As [Lorenzana lamented with forceful conviction, "The US
is very ambivalent. They are saying the MDT covers only the metropolitan
Philippines. I think their definition of metropolitan Philippine is just
the whole country and \[Spratlys\] is not included."]{.underline} During
the Nixon administration, then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger made
it clear that the "MDT may apply in event of attack on \[Philippine\]
forces deployed to third countries, which . . . is fundamentally
different from case where deployment is for purpose of enlarging
Philippine territory." Subsequent administrations, namely [the Carter
and Clinton presidencies, adopted a similar position though expanding
the scope of the MDT by stating it covers Philippines troops and vessels
operating in the area]{.underline}, while remaining officially '
neutral' on the status of sovereignty of disputed land features in the
South China Sea. There are, however, two problems with this operational
interpretation. First, it still doesn't make it clear which land
features under Philippine administration are covered by the MDT, whether
as part of "metropolitan" Philippines or "island territories under its
jurisdiction in the Pacific." The Southeast Asian country controls up to
nine land features in the Spratlys, where it has placed military
personnel and even civilian residents, particularly in the Thitu Island,
the second largest naturally formed land feature in the area. Moreover,
[as China moves towards establishing an exclusion zone in the South
China Sea, the Filipinos are asking what exactly does an attack on
Philippine troops and vessels operating in the Pacific
constitute?]{.underline} [Whether they can rely on American military
assistance in an event that China begins to coercively drive out
Filipino troops and personnel stationed in contested Spratly chain of
islands?]{.underline} Can they rely on American military assistance if
China were to reclaim the Scarborough Shoal, which lies just above one
hundred nautical miles from mainland Philippines? Of greatest
frustration to the Philippines was former U.S. President Barack [Obama
decision to repeatedly equivocate on the issue during his multiple
visits to Manila as well as his insensitive portrayal of
Philippine-claimed land features in the South China Sea as a "bunch of
rocks." In stark contrast , he made it clear that the 1951 U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty covers the disputed Senkaky/Diaoyu islands and that, in
accordance to their bilateral treaty with Japan, American forces
stationed in the northeast Asian country, "may be utilized to contribute
to the maintenance of international peace and security in the Far East
and to the security of Japan against armed attack from
without.]{.underline}" [[The fact that the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [remained largely on the sidelines during Chinese
coercive occupation of the Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef]{.mark}
(21994) [and Scarborough Shoal]{.mark} (2012) only reinforced the trauma
of insecurity among the Filipino strategists]{.underline}. [By
initiating the review process, the Philippine defense establishment is
making it clear that]{.underline} **[[Washington has to go big or go
home.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The Trump administration can amend the
mistakes of its predecessors by amending the terms of the treaty as well
as its application. In exchange, the Philippines could provide expanded
access to its prized military bases bordering the South China Sea.
[[Otherwise, pro-Beijing elements in Manila will use this opportunity to
**downgrade the alliance**]{.mark}, if not opt for outright strategic
neutrality a la Finaland and Switzerland.]{.underline}

[power projections and geo-strategic goals in the Asia-Pacific are
strongly connected to international maritime security]{.underline}. The
wider hypothesis can be "Effect of Geopolitics in the Asia-Pacific
towards Maritime Security." The relationship between geopolitical
dynamics and transnational crimes in the seas has shaped a new picture;
while an important question is; would the latter capitalize on the
stance?

## T -- Framework (vs. K Aff Version)

### 1NC -- Framework

#### The [text of the resolution]{.underline} calls for debate on hypothetical government action

**Ericson 3** (Jon M., Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts --
California Polytechnic U., et al., The Debater's Guide, Third Edition,
p. 4)

The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions,
[each topic contains certain key elements]{.underline}, although they
have slightly different functions from comparable elements of
value-oriented propositions[. 1. An agent doing the acting \-\--"The
United States" in "The United States should adopt]{.underline} a policy
of free trade." Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of value,
[the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. The verb
should]{.underline}---the first part of a verb phrase [that urges
action]{.underline}. 3. An action verb to follow should in the
should-verb combination. [For example, should adopt]{.underline} here
[means to put a]{.underline} program or [policy into action though
governmental means]{.underline}. 4. A specification of directions or a
limitation of the action desired. The phrase free trade, for example,
gives direction and limits to the topic, which would, for example,
eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs, discussing diplomatic
recognition, or discussing interstate commerce. Propositions of policy
deal with future action. Nothing has yet occurred. [The entire debate is
about whether something ought to occur.]{.underline} What you agree to
do, then, when you accept the affirmative side in such a debate is to
offer sufficient and compelling reasons for an audience to perform the
future action that you propose.

#### And, Reducing DCS and/or FMS requires governmental action

**Sorenson, 9** - Professor of International Security Studies at the
United States Air Force War College (David, [The Process and Politics of
Defense Acquisition: A Reference Handbook]{.underline}, p. 133-134

The Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961
created [the FMS program]{.underline}, which [involves
government-to-government weapons and systems sales]{.underline}. The
Defense Department operates the program on a no-loss, no-profit basis
(this means that sales are not conducted at below U.S. prices, and the
Defense Department does not make a profit on them but instead charges a
3.8 percent fee). The program starts with an official request from the
purchasing country, which the Defense Department coordinates through the
Department of State\'s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. Once
approved, the U.S. government actually contracts for the goods or
services that the recipient country requested. Usually, to facilitate
standardization with U.S. equipment (so that recipient countries can
have interoperability with U.S. equipment in exercises or in allied
combat), the FMS specifies that the particular foreign sales items are
or will be in service with the U.S. military. [Direct commercial sales,
unlike FMS, are coordinated through the Office of Trade Controls at the
State Department\'s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs]{.underline}.
In contrast to FMS, once the State Department has approved, [DCS allows
for direct negotiations between the international customer and the
manufacturer]{.underline}, which allows both to avoid the surcharges
involved with FMS and allows for specialized equipment that the
international customer requires without the need for U.S.- equivalent
equipment. It is difficult to compare the value of arms transferred
under each program because contractors participating in DCS are not
required to reveal the value of those items. Arms transfers under FMS
are coordinated between the contractor and the buyer by the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). The DSCA operates on a no-profit,
no-loss basis for the government, which charges a fee (\$15,000 or 3.8
percent of item and service cost, whichever is greater) to cover
administration costs. There is some advantage to selling items through
FMS rather than DCS, as FMS transfers items already in use with the U.S.
military, thus offering the potential for lower per-unit costs for the
U.S. operating service, as well as standardization of weapons between
the United States and an allied country. [Unlike FMS, DCS is managed by
the State Department. Direct commercial sales do not require the
coordination of the Defense Department]{.underline}, as contract
negotiations occur directly between the contractor and the recipient
country, requiring nothing more than an export license, which is issued
by the Office of Defense Trade Controls at the State Department\'s
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. Thus, the costs of DCS are often
lower than for FMS.

#### Our impact is [debatability]{.underline}---there are two internal links---

#### 1. Limits---a [bounded topic]{.underline} serves as a [predictable stasis point]{.underline} for debate that guarantees [thematic coherence]{.underline}---absent [defined limits]{.underline}, debate's competitive incentives create a [race to the margins]{.underline} that [distorts topic research]{.underline} 

#### 2. Ground---a [pre-defined controversy]{.underline} ensures a [vibrant lit base]{.underline} and [in-depth clash]{.underline}, but it's [unreasonable to prepare]{.underline} for alternative frameworks with the ground allocated to us by the parameters of the resolution---all 2AC defense to this claim will rely on [concessionary ground]{.underline} which [isn't a stable basis]{.underline} for a year of debate.

#### Debating policy forecasts in a competitive tournament format anchored by fair adjudication encourages epistemic humility and cognitive flexibility that spills outside debate---it's unique because broad under-forecasting is breeding societal dogmatism now

**Mellers, et al, 18**---George Heyman University Professor in the
psychology department at the University of Pennsylvania (Barbara, with
Philip Tetlock and Hal R. Arkes, "Forecasting tournaments, epistemic
humility and attitude depolarization," Cognition, 30 October 2018, dml)

We assume that [the future is **not perfectly knowable**]{.underline} by
any political faction---and that political beliefs are better framed as
continuous probabilities than as off-on, dogmatic certainties. Although
[this assumption]{.underline} sounds uncontroversial, it [is **widely
ignored** in the heat of political controversies]{.underline}.
Content-analytic [studies]{.underline} of election campaigns and [of
debates]{.underline} in elite legislative bodies [have found a
**widespread tendency** to express political opinions in **sharply
dichotomous fashions**]{.underline} (Hopkins and King, 2010, Tetlock,
1981, Tetlock et al., 1984). [**Good-bad**, **categorical rhetoric is
common**, and **nuanced probability judgments are rare**. Americans are
**more polarized now** than at any time in **decades**]{.underline} (Pew
Research Center, 2014, Pew Research Center, 2017). [Many of us appear to
be **Manichaean thinkers** to whom probabilistic thinking **does not
come naturally**]{.underline} (Kahneman, 2011). All of which raises a
question that is part descriptive and part normative: [How feasible is
it to induce people to **treat their political beliefs as testable
probabilistic propositions open to revision** in response to
**dissonant** as well as **consonant evidence** and
**arguments**?]{.underline} A survey of the psychological literature
suggests the grounds for pessimism out-number those for optimism.
[People are often **too quick to jump to conclusions** from fragmentary
evidence]{.underline} (Fiske and Taylor, 1991, Ross, 1977), [**too slow
to update their views** in the wake of disconfirming
evidence]{.underline} (Lord, Ross, & Lepper, 1979), [**too tempted** to
apply **weak "can-I-believe-this?" tests** to agreeable claims and
**tough "must-I-believe-this?" tests** to dissonant claims]{.underline}
(Belsky & Gilovich, 2010), **[too prone to
over-confidence]{.underline}** (Moore & Healy, 2008; Lichtenstein,
Fischhoff, & Phillips, 1982) [and **over-estimation** of how much others
share their views]{.underline} (Mullen et al., 1985, Ross et al., 1976),
[and **too fond of seeking out the company of like-minded
others**]{.underline} (Sunstein, 2004) [and, once in their company, of
**embracing increasingly extreme views**]{.underline} (Myers and Lamm,
1976, Sunstein, 2007). Whether working individually or in groups,
[people are often susceptible to **self-justifying cycles of reasoning**
that make them **progressively more self-righteous** and
**contemptuous** of the **competence** and **morality of the other
side**]{.underline} (Haidt, 2012). In this gloomy view of citizen
reasoning, we are "naïve realists" (Ross, in press) who are fated to be
"prisoners of our preconceptions" (Tetlock, 2005). There are however
**[pockets of experimental evidence]{.underline}** that [give us
**guarded grounds for optimism** that, under **well-defined
conditions**, people can shift into **more flexible modes of thinking**
and treat their political attitudes **less as dogmas** and **more as
testable propositions**. **Debiasing studies** have shown that **careful
engineering** of the **questioning process** and **social context** can
induce people to **become more aware** of how little they know, **more
attuned to alternative ways** of looking at the same reality, and **more
skilled at constructively criticizing their own views** as well as those
of **others**]{.underline}---all of which are widely seen as essential
cognitive virtues of democratic citizenship (Gutmann & Thompson, 2009).
We divide the existing work on debiasing citizen reasoning into three
categories. First, building on Rozenblit and Keil's (2002) work on the
illusion of explanatory depth, Fernbach et al., 2013, Sloman and
Fernbach, 2018 have shown that [asking people to **explain complex
policies**]{.underline}, such as transitioning to a single-payer health
care system, [makes people **appreciate the depth of their ignorance**
which in turn causes them to **moderate their policy preferences**. It
is **essential** though that the requests be explanations for "**how**"
policies work, not "**why**" one supports or opposes them---and that the
requests fall in **utilitarian** rather than **deontic domains**, topics
on which people feel that **merely invoking feelings**]{.underline} or
hunches **[would not count as a sufficient rationale]{.underline}**.
Second, building on the work of Ross (Lord et al, 1979) and Koriat et
al., 1980, Hirt and Markman, 1995 showed that [directing people to
"**consider the opposite**" and "**consider an alternative strategy**"
**reduces their confidence** in the focal hypothesis and allows them to
**entertain divergent scenarios**]{.underline}. Arkes, Faust, Guilmette
and Hart (1988) found that this strategy helped neuropsychologists asked
to read a case study and assign confidence judgments to three diagnoses.
[Those]{.underline} who listed at least one piece of evidence consistent
with each diagnosis before assigning confidence judgments [were **less
prone to**]{.underline} the **[hindsight bias]{.underline}** than those
who were told the cause and then asked to imagine the confidence ratings
they would have assigned to each causal candidate. Third, building on
classic symbolic-interactionist ideas about perspective taking in social
interaction (James, 1890, Mead, 1934), [**many studies** have shown that
**carefully choreographed forms of accountability** can induce people to
become more "**integratively complex**" thinkers]{.underline}, that is,
people [who **respect** and **balance opposing views** and **resist
biases** such as **belief perseverance** and
**over-confidence**]{.underline} (Lerner and Tetlock, 1999, Tetlock and
Kim, 1987). But [researchers **need to ensure** that participants **know
they are accountable before voicing their opinions**, and]{.underline}
researchers [also]{.underline} need to ensure [that participants
**cannot easily guess the opinions** of those to whom they **must
answer**]{.underline}. In brief, [researchers need to create
**pre-decisional accountability to an unknown audience**---a type of
accountability that we **do not often encounter** in the world but that
**blocks off cognitively simpler coping strategies**, such as **attitude
shifting** toward the evaluative audience]{.underline} (Cialdini, Levy,
& Petty, 1976) [and **defensive bolstering** of past attitudinal
commitments]{.underline} (Festinger, 1957). [This **sweet-spot form** of
accountability **boosts the integrative complexity of reasoning in
numerous studies**]{.underline} (Lerner & Tetlock, 1999).
[People]{.underline} seem to [engage in]{.underline} a coping response
known as [**pre-emptive self-criticism**, in which they **concede
legitimacy** to a **wider range of views**]{.underline} (evaluative
differentiation) [and **try to understand how reasonable people can see
the same events differently**]{.underline} (Schroder et al., 1967,
Tetlock, 1983). [Having done so, people are also **likelier to moderate
their beliefs**]{.underline}. Across all three lines of investigation,
it is striking how careful "debiasing" investigators need to be in
designing their interventions to pry open otherwise closed minds. Much
hinges on who is requesting explanations for which opinions, how they
word their requests and why people think they are being asked. We
explore a complementary approach to debiasing political judgment:
forecasting **[tournaments]{.underline}** that [challenge people to
**assign accurate probability estimates** to a **wide range of
events**]{.underline}. Tournaments are inherently multifaceted
manipulations that have arisen in response to the practical demands of
real-world organizations to provide policy-makers with timely
probability estimates of the consequences of options (Tetlock and
Gardner, 2015, Wolfers and Zitzewitz, 2004). When we inspect each facet
however, we find close parallels between their intended functions in
tournaments and the goals behind debiasing manipulations developed by
experimental psychologists. [Tournaments put participants in an
**unusual social world** in which]{.underline} all three debiasing
factors mentioned above are at work. First, [players are **strictly
accountable** for the **accuracy of their views**, **not** for offering
views that **play to the prejudices of the like-minded** as is common in
the political world. **Wishful ideological thinking will quite directly
translate into worse performance**]{.underline}. Second, [tournaments
**pressure people to acknowledge opposing arguments** in the news, as
well as **gaps in their knowledge**, both of which should have effects
that parallel those observed in the illusion-of-explanatory-depth
research: **reduce confidence to more realistic levels** and **moderate
affective preferences**]{.underline}. Third, **[if one's goal is to do
well in a]{.underline}** political forecasting [**tournament**, one is
**well advised** to engage in **perspective taking**, a **defining
property of actively open-minded thinking**]{.underline} (Baron, 2008)
[and an **empirical correlate of top performance in
tournaments**]{.underline} ("superforecasters"---Tetlock & Gardner,
2015). These parallel lines of work---laboratory debiasing and
forecasting tournaments---raise two questions for democratic theory: (a)
[if political opponents were to **participate in**]{.underline}
forecasting [**tournaments focused on issues of the day**, would they
learn to be **more circumspect** in their beliefs?]{.underline}: (b) [if
so, would that process also **reduce the extremity** of their political
attitudes, even political preferences with **no logical connection** to
the probabilistic forecasts elicited in the tournament? We present
evidence for **conditional optimism**]{.underline}. Forecasting
tournament, [participants must learn to cope with the "**culture
shock**" of moving from the **hurly-burly of the political world**, in
which **polemics dominate**, to the **pure-epistemic-accountability
world of tournaments**]{.underline}. Tournament organizers can help with
this adjustment by giving participants guidance on the larger purpose of
the exercise, on how to translate inchoate hunches into precise
probability metrics and on how the scoring rules convert probability
judgments into accuracy scores. In sharp contrast to the vague-verbiage
predictions so common in high-visibility, social-media debates in op-eds
and blogs, forecasting [tournaments]{.underline} do not give bonus
points for witty put-downs. They [incentivize forecasters to **do one
thing**]{.underline}: **[getting the best]{.underline}** "Brier
**[scores]{.underline}**" (Brier, 1950) [by]{.underline} being faster
than others at [putting **higher probabilities on things that happen**
and **lower probabilities on things that do not** while avoiding
the]{.underline} steep scoring [**penalties** that accrue to **too
hastily** declaring outcomes "**certain**" or
"**impossible**"]{.underline} (Mellers, Stone, Atanasov, et al., 2015).
[This trade-off]{.underline} is tricky. It [requires balancing
**caution** and **courage**]{.underline} (Tetlock, 2005), [where caution
refers to skill at **making well-calibrated probability
judgments**]{.underline} that match relevant base rates (e.g., events
assigned 70% probabilities happen about 70% of the time) [and courage
refers to skill at **decisively discriminating between signals** and
**noise**]{.underline}, events and non-events, **[as the evidence
warrants]{.underline}**. Forecasting tournaments are cognitively
demanding. 1.1. The Good Judgment Project The largest scale,
political-forecasting tournaments to date have been sponsored by IARPA
or the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity. From 2011 to
2015, IARPA invested tens of millions of dollars in five university
teams, each of which competed to invent the best methods of eliciting
and aggregating large numbers of human forecasts in tournaments focused
on geopolitical events. Our team, the Good Judgment Project, won these
contests. Psychologists and statisticians working together constructed
aggregate forecasts on the "right side of maybe" on more than 85% of all
daily forecasts on over 500 questions, outperforming even professional
intelligence analysts who made predictions on the same questions and had
access to classified information (Goldstein, Hartman, Comstock, &
Baumgarten, 2018). The Good Judgment Project conducted experiments by
randomly assigning forecasters to conditions that tested hypotheses
about the drivers of accuracy. We discovered five such drivers: (a)
recruitment and retention of better forecasters; (b) cognitive-debiasing
training; (c) more engaging work environments, in the form of
collaborative teamwork and prediction markets; and (d) better
aggregation rules for distilling the wisdom of the crowd (the
log-odds-extremizing algorithm of Baron et al., 2014, Satopaa et al.,
2014, Satopaa et al., 2014). But the most potent driver was to skim off
the top 2% of forecasters at the end of each tournament year and place
them in elite, superforecaster teams. Despite skeptics' predictions to
the contrary, superforecasters largely resisted regression to the mean
in follow-up years (Mellers, Stone, Murray, et al., 2015).
Superforecasters learned to make well-calibrated, high-resolution
probability judgments with quite impressive consistency (Moore et al.,
2016, Tetlock and Gardner, 2015). They figured out how to treat
uncertainty in a nuanced fashion and use more distinctions on the
probability scale to express their beliefs. These distinctions turned
out to be meaningful. When we examined the loss of accuracy with
counterfactual analyses in which forecasters were assumed to use fewer
probability distinctions by rounding their predictions to the nearest
10% or 20%, accuracy scores based on rounded forecasts were worse than
accuracy scores based on the original forecasts. Rounding forecasts
produced a loss of information that took the largest toll on the most
accurate participants-- superforecasters (Friedman, Baker, Mellers, &
Zeckhauser, 2017). 1.2. The spillover hypothesis: beliefs and attitudes
Our main goal is testing the hypothesis that the process of making
subjective-probability forecasts in tournaments has spillover effects on
attitudes toward controversial political issues. From a formal
philosophical perspective, these two classes of variables are clearly
logically distinct. Forecasts are beliefs about matters of (future)
fact, whereas policy attitudes are ultimately value judgments about what
society ought to do. But of course that does not imply that
fact-grounded forecasts and value-grounded attitudes must also be
psychologically distinct. Much hinges on one's preferred
cognitive-affective framework for representing the connections between
beliefs (often operationalized as probability judgments in the attitude
change literature) and attitudes (operationalized as evaluative or
affective judgments). For instance, viewed from the standpoint of
attitude theories that stress the primacy of affect and treat cognition
(i.e., beliefs) as post hoc justifications for feelings (Haidt, 2001,
Zajonc, 1980), our spillover hypothesis is unrealistically optimistic.
Tails don't wag dogs. Changing policy affect is far likelier to change
policy beliefs than is changing the beliefs to change attitudes. But
viewed from the standpoint of cognition-driven theories that depict
attitudes as derivative products of expectancy-value calculations, as in
Fishbein and Ajzen's (1975) theory of reasoned action and in classical
decision theory, the spillover hypothesis is reasonable as long as the
attitudes are woven into networks of relevant beliefs. If so, when the
beliefs moderate, so too should the relevant attitudes. Neither of these
theoretical camps would however predict the strong version of the
spillover effect that we are proposing: namely, that [tournaments can
**moderate attitudes** by **changing how people think**, a
**cognitive-stylistic shift** in which the **more flexible** and
**analytic style** of thinking about beliefs encouraged by tournaments
**spills over** into how people make "**should**" or **attitudinal
judgments** on topics with **close-to-zero expectancy-value linkage** to
the probabilistic beliefs they endorsed in tournaments]{.underline}. To
operationalize this idea, imagine we ran a study in which the
forecasting questions focused on exactly the same topics as the attitude
questions---and we discovered, say, that the (humbling) process of
trying to forecast in which cities charter schools boosted test scores
caused people to moderate their policy attitudes about charter schools.
Few observers would be surprised. But the current design provides a
tougher test. There are no strong connections between the forecasting
questions and the policy-attitude questions asked at the end of the
forecasting year. [We **test the hypothesis** that the **cognitively
demanding process** of participating in a tournament---of **having to
balance evidence** to put **well-calibrated probability estimates**
on]{.underline}, say, third quarter GDP [**growth** or **presidential
popularity**---has a **spillover effect** when people take
normative/"should" attitude positions on **unrelated
issues**]{.underline} such as the minimum wage or voter-identification
laws or U.S. policy toward Iran. Tournaments require forecasters to
transform their hunches into numbers that roughly conform to the axioms
of probability, a nontrivial task. When they do internet searches to
discover what high-profile pundits say, they get little help because the
"predictions" advanced in such debates are rarely sufficiently explicit
to be testable. After all, elites need to preserve their long-term
credibility so they tend to avoid numerical probability judgments that
could later be mocked as embarrassingly far off (Tetlock & Gardner,
2015). It is safer to make vague-verbiage forecasts, such as "x might
well happen" or "there is a distinct possibility of y" that
psychological research has shown comfortably straddle both sides of
50/50 or "maybe" (Wallsten, Budescu, & Zwick, 1993). If an event
happens, one can say "I warned you it was a distinct possibility" and if
the event never happens, one can shrug it off by saying "I merely said
it was possible." To avoid this problem, forecasting tournaments press
people to make their beliefs explicit and do what Nate Silver, the
founder of the 538 website, routinely does: attach specific numerical
probabilities to possible futures. After the 2016 US Presidential
election, Silver was chastised for falling on what appeared to be the
"wrong side of maybe." He had placed a 70% probability on a Clinton
presidency. Was he wrong? Drawing the correct conclusion requires an
understanding that: (a) 70% might have been the best forecast possible
at the time; (b) the poll aggregation techniques on which Silver relies
were well calibrated, which means that when Silver makes probabilistic
predictions of events, those events tend to occur roughly 70% of the
time. They will "look wrong" about 30% of the time (Lichtenstein et al.,
1982). Unfortunately, the vague-verbiage forecasting habits that confer
political safety on pundits also make it extremely difficult, arguably
impossible, to become a more realistic appraiser of the probabilities of
real-world events. [Without **measurement** of forecasting accuracy,
learning **can't take place**]{.underline}. To invoke an old
Wittgenstein aphorism, the limits of our language are the limits of our
world. [It is **hard to figure out whether**]{.underline} probability
**[judgments]{.underline}** of 70% [**are well-calibrated** if one is
**unsure** when one made]{.underline} 70% [forecasts]{.underline} and
unsure [of **what happened** when one did. The **potential mind-opening
power** of]{.underline} forecasting [tournaments comes from the fact
that they **pressure us to recognize the limits of our knowledge** and
focus on the world **as it is**, **not as we wish it to be**. They
expose us to]{.underline} the same criticisms that Nate Silver
experienced \-- [being on the "**wrong side of maybe**."]{.underline}
Forecasting [tournaments **push people out of their**]{.underline}
vague-verbiage [**comfort zone** and ask them to **quantify
uncertainty** in **as granular a fashion** as the problem permits. It is
this **more tentative** and **granular mode of thinking inculcated
in**]{.underline} forecasting [**tournaments** that]{.underline} we
hypothesize [can **spill over into unrelated attitude judgments outside
the tournament**]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- Empathy / Turns Case 

#### Debate's [not]{.underline} about finding the perfect solution, it's about [learning from the failures of our imperfect ones]{.underline}---the belief that any one debate can translate to material outcomes is [naïve at best]{.underline} and [complicit in the systems they critique at worst]{.underline}---topical advocacy encourages an ethos of [humility]{.underline} and [interconnectedness]{.underline} which can engender [ontological shifts]{.underline} in society and [confront the crises of modernity]{.underline}---but that requires a [willingness to be wrong]{.underline}

**Andreotti, 18**---Canada Research Chair in Race, Inequalities and
Global Change at University of British Columbia and Associate Professor
in the Faculty of Education (Vanessa de Oliviera, interviewed by Scott
Baker, "Countless Rebellions -- Decolonizing education,"
<https://mcconnellfoundation.ca/interview/vanessa-andreotti/>, dml)

Andreotti: When I talk about **[humility]{.underline}**, it [is about
**sitting at the edge**, understanding the **limits of knowing**, not
only of **our own knowledge**, the limits of **knowing itself**, the
limits of **making sense of the world**]{.underline} --- understanding
that it's possible to reason with other senses. [Although we see
ourselves as]{.underline} individuated or as [**individuals**, we are
**interwoven with everything else**. If we are going to **engage with
the world in change-making**, it would be important to both **understand
the contradictions** and **paradoxes** of our own ways of knowing, but
also to **sit at the edge of the way of being** that engendered this way
of knowing so that we can engage with the world **without trying to
project our delusions onto the world itself**, without trying to
**over-determine** both the **direction** and **how the relationship
should happen**]{.underline}. So, starting from a place of not knowing
and engaging with the world as if we are not individuals, as we inhibit
each other in multiple temporalities, and taking responsibility for this
form of engagement, I think, for me, is what humility entails. If we are
able to be humble and accept that we exist as a part of a much larger
society and ecosystem, how do we then go about creating systems change?
Andreotti: A system rises, peaks, and starts its decline. And,
generally, [when a **system is in decline**, a lot of people want to
**walk out** from that system]{.underline}. This is the work of Debra
Friesen. But one important thing to remember [when we are walking
out]{.underline} is that [**we can't create a different system from the
hot ashes of the system that hasn't yet cooled down**. In many
alternative movements, people **want results straight away**. They want
to **substitute the system** that they had before for something that
they **already know that they can control**. This is]{.underline} just
again [a **replacement** of the securities that were promised by the
system, the other system, and now these promises are **perceived as
broken**. But what if we understand the promises of the systems as
**unrealistic from the outset** and start to look for other
securities?]{.underline} In that sense, [what we need is **not to
replace it straight away**, because **we can't**]{.underline},
basically. [We will end up **reproducing the old system whether we like
it or not**]{.underline}. But what if [what we need to do is
**experimentation**]{.underline}? [If we want to experiment, we need to
**start from a place of not knowing**, because **otherwise it's not an
experiment**, it's you trying to **engineer something**]{.underline}.
But [if it is an experiment]{.underline}, you are kind of doing it, [you
are designing something that **you know is going to fail**, and the
**learning from this failure** is the **most important
thing**]{.underline}. How do you go about making sure that you fail in
the right way? Andreotti: The same way that a new system cannot be built
on the hot ashes of the old, the role of improvisation here is that the
difficulties that we face --- [this sitting at the limits of what is
perceived as possible of what we know, the **learning that can take
place** in that space, through **failure**]{.underline} --- [becomes a
**fertilizer for something else that happens when these ashes cool
down**, the ashes of the old system]{.underline}. [What]{.underline} I
think [is important]{.underline} here [is **not to see failure as
failure**. Failure is also **success**. It's success in terms of the
**learning that it generates** --- for the **possibility that it
opens**, in terms of the **new world that it can create**]{.underline}.
As a researcher, for example, in an experiment, [if I **keep doing the
same experiment**, with the **same results**, it becomes not only a
**waste of energy**, but, because I'm **not deriving any learning out of
it**, also **boring**!]{.underline} There is a sense of it in this
experimentation and improvisation, that [in order for it to be
**fulfilling**, and **rewarding**, and **exciting**, and **fun** even,
it needs to be **learning**. And it needs to be **learning from
failure**. And it needs to **make mistakes** too!]{.underline} [It's
**part of the process**.]{.underline} So, [how can we **turn ourselves
to this other way of experimenting** where we are not afraid, we are
actually **quite okay with both failing** and
**succeeding**]{.underline} and stumbling and falling and getting back
up, [and **not being overwhelmed** or **exhausted** by this
process]{.underline} --- [by our **desire to get
somewhere**]{.underline}, right? I keep saying that [if you think this
is going to be a **process from A to B**]{.underline}, the only thing I
can tell you is that [you're going to be **frustrated**. For a **long
time**. But if you understand that there's **no end**, and that the
**process itself**]{.underline}, the path itself, [is what you're
looking for]{.underline} --- and [with all its **problems**, and
**paradoxes** and **contradictions**]{.underline} --- [it's **joy** that
comes out of **walking together**, and **breathing together** and
**learning together**, then]{.underline}, I think, [we are in a **very
different footing** to be able to **tackle the crisis** that we have to
tackle **together**]{.underline}. [It can be tempting to conceive a
system's change in terms of **ourselves**, our **communities**, or even
the **societies** within which we live, but]{.underline} as Vanessa
teaches, by [thinking about change vis-à-vis **those who are coming
next**]{.underline}, it [opens up a **different approach**.]{.underline}
Andreotti: So, [if we have this **responsibility towards those who are
coming next** rather than the responsibility towards **making us become
the heroes**]{.underline} of the new system, [or the **engineers** of
the new system, we]{.underline} are going to **[shift the
focus]{.underline}** of our attention and [of our learning from the
**outcomes** to this **process** of]{.underline} walking and
[experimenting knowing that it will require falls and
stumbles]{.underline} and rest and laughter and being naked, [and
helping each other in the journey **rather** than trying to **quickly
replace** the securities that we lost with the **same securities
disguised as something else**]{.underline}. What becomes possible if we
change the way we view the world? Andreotti: So, [if we can get to a
point where we are **present to the world**]{.underline}, we are
disarmed towards the world, [and we are **decentered**, we are **with
the world**, **extremely attentive** to what we are being called to do
with others in order to **shift our ontological reality** and also
**operate within this reality with responsibility**]{.underline}, then
we are onto something else. And [I'm not saying that this is going to be
**necessarily immediately better**]{.underline}. I'm saying that [this
is going to **open up other possibilities** that are **viable** --- but
they are **unthinkable** or **unimaginable at the moment**.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Deliberation Impact

#### External impact---the terms of the resolution create a [meta-language]{.underline} that offers a [rubric for evaluating arguments]{.underline} under a [deliberative framework]{.underline}. Responding to T with "but our discussion's important" is a rhetorical tactic [straight out of Trump's pocket]{.underline}---making the topic into a [first-order question]{.underline} sidesteps [deliberative testing]{.underline}, which breeds [dogmatic group polarization]{.underline} and trades [argumentation]{.underline} for [power]{.underline}

**Aikin and Talisse, 17**---Assistant Professor of Philosophy AND W.
Alton Jones Professor of Philosophy, Professor of Political Science, and
Chair of the Philosophy Department at Vanderbilt University (Scott and
Robert, "Democracy, Deliberation, And The Owl Of Minerva Problem," The
Critique, January/February 2017, dml)

To see this, consider that [so many features of]{.underline} democratic
[political life **depend for their intelligibility** on the aspirations
of **good argumentative culture**. News is no longer simply read, but is
presented in a format of pro-and-con panel debate; journalists ask
questions about reasons politicians have for policies, and test
politicians' views for internal consistency; public debates are
organized prior to elections. These are all in the service of
**realizing a deliberative democracy**, a mode of democratic politics
where public argument is]{.underline} a (perhaps the)
**[central]{.underline}** civic activity. Note further that [the
deliberativist aspiration drives our criticism of what are generally
taken to be democratically degenerative forms of political
communication. Bias, spin]{.underline}, derp, [lying,
flip-flopping]{.underline}, glad-handing, and all the rest [could hardly
be regarded as deserving of political criticism **except against the
backdrop** of the **ideals of deliberative democracy**. These terms
would not be accusatory were it not presumed that democratic citizens
are committed to a politics of **epistemically sound public
argumentation**]{.underline}. Though [the deliberativist
aspiration]{.underline} is widespread, and arguably constitutive of
contemporary democracy, it [remains an aspiration]{.underline}. As we
all know, public argumentation among democratic citizens is at best a
mixed bag. [Attempts to deliberativize democracy are **fraught with
hazards**]{.underline}. For one thing, democratic [citizens tend to
discuss politics **mainly with like-minded others**. This
occasions]{.underline} the difficulties associated with the phenomenon
known as [**group polarization**: as like-minded people speak to each
other about their shared views, their positions shift towards **more
extreme versions**]{.underline}. Put otherwise, [under conditions of
doxastic homogeneity, deliberation produces extremism. And as one's
views progress towards extremity, one grows **increasingly unable** to
countenance the possibility of **reasoned**, **informed**, and **sincere
disagreement**]{.underline}. That is, [group polarization
feeds]{.underline} what Julian Sanchez has described as [**epistemic
closure**, the incapacity to see views that run counter to one's own as
**even intelligible**. And as one's views become epistemically closed,
one will increasingly find one's critics to be **incompetent**,
**insincere**, **dishonest**, and **ignorant**]{.underline}. Their
points will appear as mere noise or petulant emoting. Eventually, [one
will see fit to simply stop listening to those who espouse opposing
views]{.underline}. As a result, [there will be progressive **all-around
marginalization** of **unorthodox**, **unpopular**, and **unfamiliar
political views**]{.underline}. Those already least likely to get a
hearing will be increasingly regarded as incapable of intelligible
speech. Accordingly, the deliberativists' central democratic mechanism
seems to undermine democracy. Of course, these difficulties become only
more pronounced once it is noticed that public political deliberation is
of necessity largely mediated by various modern communicative
technologies. No deliberative democrat explicitly calls strictly for
face-to-face discussions among citizens; public deliberation must be
facilitated by intermediary institutions, such as social media,
television news channels, websites, and online forums of many other
kinds. Despite the fact that these communication platforms all offer the
potential for robust argumentative exchange among citizens who may be
geographically and politically distant from one another, in practice,
they tend to exacerbate the vices outlined above. A casual survey of the
comments thread of nearly any news site will show that polarization,
closure, and marginalization are the norm. Well-run argument is beyond
scarce on the internet. The owl of Minerva flies only at dusk. Only
after we have identified these pathologies and suffered their
consequences can we think about how to mitigate them. There are many
fixes on offer among theorists of democracy. Some argue in favor of new
and demanding civic duties that require citizens to read widely across
the political spectrum. Others propose institutional interventions,
ranging from the enactment of "equal time" laws for news outlets and
websites, to the creation of a new national holiday devoted to
professionally-orchestrated public deliberation events.
Empirically-minded theorists of deliberative democracy are working
vigilantly on these matters. It is safe to say that there is no easy way
to inoculate deliberative democracy against these pathologies. But even
if there were, we worry that another, even more foreboding difficulty
lurks. There is reason to think that public argument itself, even when
institutional distortions do not pervert it, yields its own pathologies.
Consider the following. [Some arguments fail]{.underline} because they
run on false premises. Other arguments fail [because they draw an
**obviously unwarranted conclusion** from their premises]{.underline},
much in the manner in which a magician pulls a rabbit out of his hat. In
such cases, it isn't difficult to see that something has gone awry. But
some cases of the latter kind of failure aren't so obviously failures.
[These are cases of **fallacious argument**]{.underline}. Fallacies are
arguments that we tend to regard as good, but in fact are not. [We have
to **work** to **see them as failures**, and developing the ability to
see them as failures requires us to craft concepts with which to
diagnose the ways in which they go wrong. This calls us to **theorize
arguments**]{.underline}. The task is notoriously difficult, as the
proliferation of textbooks and college courses on Critical Thinking
suggests. One trouble is that [the variety of seemingly good (but in
fact bad) arguments is]{.underline} considerably wider than the variety
of diagnostic names we have for them. Moreover, this variety is itself
[**continually moving** and **growing**]{.underline}. Our apparently
endlessly creative linguistic capacities occasions a similarly capacious
field for the creation of new forms of fallacious argumentation. As a
consequence, [it is often **only in retrospect** --- **after the debates
are over**, **votes are cast**, and **decisions are made** --- that the
illusions can be **revealed for what they are**]{.underline}. And with
the proliferation of communication outlets and argumentative forums,
argumentation theory can hardly keep up. One reason why our theories
have a hard time keeping up is that [our best models of argument take
them centrally to be **dialogues**, between **two** people or
parties,]{.underline} [who **exchange reasons**, each with the purpose
of **changing the other's mind**. But this]{.underline} dyadic
(two-sided) [model is **no longer fitting**. It leaves out of its
purview the fact that argumentative dialogues]{.underline}, especially
when occurring by means of modern technological mediation, [are
performed]{.underline} largely [for]{.underline} the sake of onlooking
**[audiences]{.underline}**. [The two discussants may reply to each
other, but their objective is actually to **move the audience**. Once we
see this **triadic** (three-sided) structure to political
argumentation]{.underline}, many otherwise [strange phenomena start to
**make sense**.]{.underline} Consider the textbook straw man fallacy. In
the case of the straw man, one takes one's opponent's view and restates
it in a form that is more easily criticizable. One then goes after the
new (and worse) version of the view with justly critical lines about it.
And then one closes the discussion. For sure, this would not convince
the opponent, as they would only say that this criticized version of the
view is not their own. But a straw man argument can move an onlooking
audience, those who may not be familiar with the issue under debate, who
may not be particularly sympathetic with one side, or who may just be
looking for a moment of easy clarity with the issue. The straw man
strategy gives them what they are looking for. Consider, further, that
much of the textbook vocabulary concerning fallacies has made it into
the vernacular. One of particular note is that of the ad hominem, the
fallacy of inferring that someone is wrong from the fact that they
exhibit some irrelevant personal vice. It is common to find in popular
political discourse charges of the ad hominem. To be sure, the
prohibitions on name-calling and insulting an interlocutor's person in
the midst of a debate is very old; but now that we have a name for the
prohibited strategy, we have a critical tool to invoke in the midst of
argument. That the vocabulary of "ad hominem" and "straw man" has
entered the political vernacular means that public arguers have
additional means with which to sort the good reasons from the bad. But
notice that when the argumentative strategy of invoking a fallacy name
is used, it occurs as yet one more move in the developing argumentative
exchange. One invokes the straw man or the ad hominem as a way of
criticizing one's interlocutor. So, when Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**
was criticized in the Republican Primary debates for his use of the ad
hominem, he [interpreted]{.underline} the [criticism simply as **more
naysaying** to contend with in the argument; he did not take the
criticism to be **targeting his style of engagement**]{.underline}.
Three specific examples are of note. The first is when Senator Rand Paul
(R-KY) chastised Trump for insulting people for their looks. Trump
responded, "I have never attacked Rand Paul on his looks . . . . And
believe me, there's plenty of subject matter there". The second is when
Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) impersonated Trump to open the Iowa debates
(Trump was absent). Cruz began: "Let me say that I'm a maniac, and
everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly. And Ben (Carson),
you're a terrible surgeon . . . . And now that we've got the Donald
Trump portion out of the way . . . . ". Third and finally, at the very
late Texas primary debate, Trump acknowledged the effects his attacks on
others, and noted, "So far, I cannot believe how civil it's been up
here". What is troubling here is that in these moments [the vocabulary
for criticizing the mode of argumentation has become **merely one more
tactic** in the argument]{.underline}, one more way to discredit
another's views. [The **whole point** of developing the diagnostic
language]{.underline} of fallacies [is to create a vocabulary with which
we can **argue about the argument itself**, rather than the
**first-order claims** at issue within it]{.underline}. In particular,
the Cruz moment is important, because, in accusing Trump of relying on
the ad hominem, Cruz is himself attacking Trump, the person. That is,
the impersonation of Trump's ad hominem is itself a form of ad hominem.
And so, instead of being a tool for evaluating the mode of the debate,
the fallacy-charge falls back into the debate itself; it becomes yet one
more tactic internal to the dispute. Trump obviously sees this point
very clearly, as he plays with insulting (by not insulting) Rand Paul,
and goes out of his way to acknowledge and congratulate himself that he
(and the others) haven't been name-calling in the Texas debate. We argue
in our natural languages, and so often when we argue, we argue over
economies, animals, environments, poverty, and so on. But [arguments are
**structured collections of statements** that are alleged to manifest
certain kinds of logical relations]{.underline}; consequently, [they,
too, can be the subject of scrutiny and disagreement]{.underline}. And
often in order to evaluate a claim about, say, poverty, we need to
attend specifically to the argument alleged to support it. [In order to
discuss arguments, as arguments, we must develop a language about the
argumentative use of language]{.underline}. That is, [we must develop a
**metalanguage**. The objective in developing a
metalanguage]{.underline} about argument [is to enable us to talk about
a given argument's quality **without taking a side in the debate** over
the truth of its conclusion]{.underline}. Accordingly, [with the
metalanguage in place, we can assess the quality of a given argument
**without reference to our own view** of the matter under
dispute]{.underline}. Among other things, [the metalanguage enables us
to **criticize the arguments offered** by people with whom we agree, and
it similarly allows us to recognize that sometimes **a powerful argument
can be produced** for a conclusion that we know is false]{.underline}.
But perhaps most importantly, [the metalanguage enables certain
**crucial self-critical assessments**; it is by means of the
metalanguage that we can **assess our arguments as lacking** without
thereby adopting a skeptical stance with regard to our own first-order
positions]{.underline}. Put more simply, [it is by means of the
metalanguage about argument that we can **stand above the fray of our
first-order disputes**]{.underline}, as it were, [and ascend to a
relatively impartial plane from which to assess not the matter under
dispute, but the dispute itself]{.underline}. One might say that
rationality itself depends upon our ability to competently wield a
metalanguage about reasoning, debate, and argument. [The problem is that
when the concepts of the metalanguage are **used as first-order tools**
in an ongoing argument, the impartiality of the metalanguage is
**dissolved**. And so **with Trump**, the language]{.underline} of
fallacies [became]{.underline} for all involved in the debates [yet
**one more competing view** about which to wrangle. The metalanguage for
assessing the mode of dispute was **dragged into the dispute itself**,
and, predictably, the rationality of the exchanges **dissolved
precipitously**]{.underline}. The owl of Minerva flies only at dusk.
**[Only after]{.underline}** the day is done, after [the argument is
over, are the tools of wisdom available. The tools of argument
assessment, when applied **in the midst of the argument**, are
**mistaken for**, or are **appropriated as**, yet more **first-order
claims**. They are **entered into the breach**, and so **can no longer
assess it**. Subsequent debate **flies free** of
**evaluative**]{.underline} and rational [**constraints**. And what
passes for argument then is **mere power**]{.underline}.

The requirements thus far are primarily negative. The ambiguists must
say "no" to---they must reject and limit---some ideas and actions. In
what follows, we will also find that they must say "yes" to some things.
In particular, [they must say "yes" to the idea of rational persuasion.
This means]{.underline}, first, [that they must recognize the role of
agreement in political contest, or the basic accord that is necessary to
discord]{.underline}. The mistake that the ambiguists make here is a
common one. The mistake in thinking that agreement marks the end of
contest. In most cases, however, our agreements are highly imperfect. We
agree on some matters but not on others, on generalities but not on
specifics, on principles but not on their applications, and so on. And
[this kind of limited agreement is the **starting condition** of contest
and debate]{.underline}. As John Courtney Murray writes: We hold certain
truths; therefore we can argue about them. It seems to have been one of
the corruptions of intelligence by positivism to assume that argument
ends when agreement is reached. In a basic sense, the reverse is true.
[There can be no agreement except on the premise]{.underline}, and
within a context, [of agreement]{.underline}. (Murray 1960, 10) In other
words, [we **cannot argue** about something]{.underline} if we are not
communicating: [if we cannot agree on the topic and terms of
argument]{.underline} or if we have utterly different ideas about what
counts as evidence or good argument. [At the very least, we must agree
about what it is that is being debated before we can debate
it]{.underline}. For instance, [one cannot have an argument about
euthanasia with someone who thinks euthanasia is a musical
group]{.underline}. One cannot successfully stage a sit-in if one's
target audience simply thinks everyone is resting or if those doing the
sitting have no complaints. [Nor can one demonstrate resistance to a
policy if no one knows that it is a policy. In other words, contest is
meaningless if there is a lack of agreement or communication about what
is being contested.]{.underline} Registers, demonstrators, **[and
debaters must have]{.underline}** some [shared ideas about the **subject
and**]{.underline}/or [**terms** of their disagreements]{.underline}.
The participants and the target of a sit-in must share an understanding
of the complaint at hand. And a demonstrator's audience must know what
is being resisted. In short, [the contesting of an idea presumes some
agreement about what that idea is and how one might go about
intelligibly contesting it]{.underline}. In other words, [contestation
rests on some basic agreement or harmony]{.underline}.∂ The point may
seem trite, as surely the ambiguists would agree that basic terms must
be shared before they can be resisted and problematized. In fact, they
are often very candid about this seeming paradox in their approach: the
paradoxical or \"parasitic\" need of the subversive for an order to
subvert.∂ But admitting the paradox is not helpful if, as usually
happens here, its implications are ignored; or if the only implication
drawn is that order or harmony is an unhappy fixture of human life. For
what the paradox should tell us is that [some kinds of]{.underline}
harmonies or [orders are, in fact, good for resistance]{.underline}; and
some ought to be fully supported. As such, it should counsel against the
kind of careless rhetoric that lumps all orders or harmonies together as
arbitrary and inhumane. Clearly some [basic accord about the terms of
contest is a necessary ground for **all** further contest. It may be
that if the ambiguists]{.underline} [wish to remain
full-fledged]{.underline} ambiguists, [they cannot admit to these
implications, for to open the door to some agreements]{.underline} or
reasons as good and some orders as helpful or necessary, [is to open the
door to]{.underline} some sort of [rationalism]{.underline}. Perhaps
[they might just continue to insist]{.underline} that this initial
condition is ironic, but [that]{.underline} the irony [should not stand
in the way of the real business of subversion]{.underline}.∂ [Yet
difficulties remain]{.underline}. For [agreement is not simply the
initial condition, but the continuing ground, for contest]{.underline}.
If we are to successfully communicate our disagreements, we cannot
simply agree on basic terms and then proceed to debate without attention
to further agreements. [For debate and contest are forms of dialogue:
that is, they are activities premised on the building of progressive
agreements]{.underline}.∂ [Imagine, for instance, that two people are
having an argument about the issue of gun control]{.underline}. As noted
earlier, in any argument, **[certain initial agreements will be needed
just to begin the discussion]{.underline}**. At the very least, [the two
discussants must agree on **basic terms**: for example, they must have
some shared sense of what gun control is about; what is at issue in
arguing about it; what facts are being contested]{.underline}, and so
on. They must also agree---and they do so simply by entering into
debate---that they will not use violence or threats in making their
cases and that they are willing to listen to, and to be persuaded by,
good arguments. Such agreements are simply implicit in the act of
argumentation.\',∂ Imagine, then, that our two discussants have the
following kind of exchange:∂ Mary Cuns don\'t kill people; people kill
people.∂ Tom: Yes, but guns make it a lot easier for people to kill one
another.∂ Mary: That\'s not necessarily true. There are lots of other
murder weapons---knives or rat poison, for instance---that may be just
as handy and lethal.∂ At this point, the argument reaches an impasse.
Tom has presented i claim that Mary does not accept. Thus, if the
argument is to continue, Tom must either find a way to convince Mary oi
this claim or he must go on to a different line of argument. Let us say
that, in this case, lorn backs up his initial claim with further
evidence. Perhaps he has some evidence to show that people are less apt
to survive a gunshot wound than they are to survive being stabbed or
poisoned. Mary then relents on this point:∂ ∂ Mary: All right, I\'ll
grant you that gun shot wounds an? more apt to kill people. But that\'s
exactly the reason I want lo own a gun---so I can effectively protect
myself and my family.∂ Tom: Well I sympathize with that motive, but 1
don\'t think owning a gun is the best way to protect yourself. In fact,
I\'ve heard that people who own guns are more apt to get injured or
killed them¬selves than to protect themselves against an intruder.∂
Mary: What?! I find that very difficult to believe.∂ Here, again, our
discussants reach an impasse. If the argument is to go further, they
must either find a way to agree on the disputed claim, or move on to
another claim (if there is one). Thus, if Tom has some further evidence
that Mary will find convincing, they can continue this line of
reasoning; if he does not, then they must move on to something else or
give up the argument completely.∂ This is the ordinary ebb and flow of
debate. Argument continues .is long as there is some hope of progress in
coming to agreement or as long as there are other lines of argument to
be explored. But if there∂ ∂ comes a point a I which the two sides run
out of new claims or cannot igree about the facts supporting claims
already made, the argument is effectively over. The participants may
continue to shout at one an¬other, as they often do, but there is no
longer anything positive or informative that can come from their
interaction. There is nothing more to be learned and nothing that either
side will find convincing.∂ The point here is that in arguing---and the
point holds equally for other forms of contest---we assume that it is
possible to educate or persuade one another. We assume that it is
possible to come to more mutual understandings of an issue and that the
participants in an argument are open to this possibility. [Otherwise,
there is **no** **point** to the exercise; we are **simply talking at or
past one another**]{.underline}.∂ [At this point,]{.underline} the
[ambiguists might respond that, even if there are such rules of
argument, they do not apply to]{.underline} the more [subversive or
radical activities]{.underline} they have in mind. Subversion is, after
all, about questioning and undermining such seemingly \"necessary\" or
universal rules of behavior.∂ **[But]{.underline}**, again, the response
to the ambiguist must be that [the practice of questioning]{.underline}
and undermining [rules]{.underline}, like all other social practices,
[**needs a certain order**. The subversive **needs rules** to protect
subversion. And when we look more closely at the rules protective of
subversion, we find that they are roughly the rules of
argument]{.underline} discussed above. In fact, the rules of argument
are roughly the rules of democracy or civility: the delineation of
boundaries necessary to protect speech and action from violence,
manipulation and other forms of tyranny.
