#### U.S. credibility on the brink -- uncertainty over commitments to the region and a rising China -- perceptions are critical to confidence

The United States has major economic, strategic, and national security
interests in Asia. **[In the 21st century, Asia's importance to the U.S.
will only continue to grow.]{.underline}** Not only is it home to the
second-largest and third-largest economies in the world, Asia is the
only component of the global economy with significant prospects for
growth. In a world of global value chains and markets, **[threats to
these areas of the world also matter to the U.S.]{.underline}** **[A
strong American]{.underline}** economic, diplomatic, and **[military
presence in the region is necessary because without it, Asia is
geopolitically unstable.]{.underline}** The U.S. is the hub of a "wagon
wheel" of bilateral alliances that undergirds regional security. In
fact, **[this regional balancing is of such importance that several
countries there---such as Japan and South Korea---subsidize America's
military presence there. Local and American forces achieve far more
together than either would alone in protecting their shared
interests.]{.underline}** The U.S. has treaty commitments to five allies
in the Western Pacific: Australia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea,
and Thailand. The alliances in East Asia and Australia, combined with
forward-deployed forces of more than 80,000 troops and the Seventh Fleet
throughout, serve as anchors of America's resident power status to
balance the rise of China and ensure regional peace and security. [U.S.
military bases in Japan and South Korea, in particular, are
indispensable to stability in the region.]{.underline} Prepared for war
at a moment's notice, U.S. and South Korean forces are highly
integrated. U.S. and Japanese **[forces]{.underline}**, meanwhile,
**[are becoming even closer due to changes to alliance guidelines and to
other restrictions on Japan's defense policy over the past couple of
years]{.underline}**. U.S. forces in Japan are also being realigned and
repositioned in order to make them sustainable in the long run.
Additionally, the U.S. has made important new enhancements to its
presence in Australia, the Philippines, and Singapore. All is not a rosy
picture, though. **[Allies' overall confidence in U.S. leadership has
been undermined in recent years by perceptions]{.underline}** of
American economic decline, **[uncertainty over U.S. commitment to the
region,]{.underline}** defense budget cuts and procurement decisions,
the **[rapid rise of China, and deference to Chinese interests,
particularly concerning Taiwan]{.underline}**. The Administration has
made important progress with individual allies, but strained to counter
these doubts in the absence of solutions to underlying causes. The
United States faces two major threats in East Asia. One is long-term,
involving both opportunities and risk. It revolves around the rise of
China and the destabilizing effect this rise could have on the region.
The second is more acute. It focuses on the ever-increasing threat of
the North Korean nuclear program to both the region and the American
homeland.

#### Credibility is [on the brink]{.underline} -- arms sales are [the only thing]{.underline} holding it together.

//reem

However, after Trump's Mar-a-Lago summit with Chinese President Xi
Jinping, the administration's tone has changed. In an interview with
Reuters, **[Trump was asked about another call with Tsai. Trump replied
that he had "a very good relationship with President Xi... and would
want to speak to him first." This indicated that relations with Taiwan
would be constrained by Trump's hope for Chinese cooperation on North
Korea.]{.underline}** No previous administration had made such a trade
off between our Taiwan and North Korean interests. Recognizing how such
a linkage damages U.S. credibility, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis
subsequently included in his address to the Shangri-La Dialogue a clear
restatement of our commitment to supply Taiwan with defense articles in
keeping with the Taiwan Relations Act. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
has reassured the Congress that the U.S. intends to keep its commitments
to Taiwan. There is no doubt that Taiwan requires additional defense
articles. What should be sold is a matter of debate, but the fundamental
fact is that the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) capabilities against
Taiwan continue to expand. The PLA defense budget is now about 14 times
larger than Taiwan's. The Department of Defense's 2017 report on
security developments in the PRC concludes that, despite Taipei's
defense improvements, the defensive advantages Taiwan has enjoyed are
declining. **[Delaying arms sales to Taiwan is one issue that is
undermining regional confidence in the United States. The delay is part
of a pattern of actions or inactions by the Trump administration that
has weakened U.S. credibility in Asia]{.underline}**. That is why Mattis
had to make so many specific reassuring statements in his address in
Singapore. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty about whether those words
will be implemented or overruled by the president, as has happened on
other issues. Consequently, **[the notification to Congress of new arms
sales is essential to putting these doubts to rest]{.underline}**. In
the meantime, **[inaction feeds uncertainty]{.underline}**. Since
President Trump tweeted about "one China" last December, the Taiwan
media has been full of commentary questioning whether the United States
is reliable. Not surprisingly, the pro-PRC media has argued that, since
Trump will treat Taiwan as a bargaining chip, it is foolish for Taiwan
to rely on the United States and that greater accommodation with Beijing
is required. Even some commentators well disposed toward the United
States have said that the more volatile environment under Trump is a new
reality. The delay in announcing new arms sales has been cited as
evidence of Washington's declining reliability. Taiwan's 2017 Ministry
of Defense Quadrennial Defense Report released in May stated for the
first time that U.S. policy toward Taiwan "remains to be seen." Trump's
belief that his good relations with Xi require him to consult Beijing
about Taiwan is based on a flawed understanding of China. China respects
power and a consistent commitment to one's principles. Consequently,
successive U.S. administrations have sought to convince Beijing that the
peaceful settlement of cross-strait differences is a matter of principle
for the United States. The tradeoff of one U.S. interest for another
will only lead Beijing to conclude that the Washington does not have any
principles. By indicating that relations with Taiwan can be traded away
for Beijing's support on North Korea, Trump has damaged the U.S.
interest with respect to maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. The
delays in arms sales decisions could be avoided if the U.S. government
adopted a practice of regularly approving sales rather than accumulating
items into packages that are more politically sensitive to Beijing.
Although the wisdom of this has been recognized both in and out of
government for at least two decades, successive administrations have
been unable to implement regular approvals. Given the president's
penchant for changing his views and given the uncertainty of who can
speak with authority for his administration, it is truer than ever that
action speaks louder than words. An early notification of **[new arms
for Taiwan is necessary to put to rest doubts that are undermining the
credibility of U.S. support for Taiwan's security.]{.underline}**

The argument that Washington should abandon support for Taiwan to gain
favor with Beijing faces strong counter-arguments that have prevailed in
policy-making up to now. George Washington University professor Charles
L. Glaser presents a fresh reboot of the idea in the spring 2015 issue
of the journal International Security. Glaser says protecting
Asia-Pacific allies is a vital U.S. interest, but protecting Taiwan is
not. Yet Taiwan is the main cause of Chinese opposition to U.S.
strategic leadership in the region. Meanwhile, tensions between China
and rival claimants over disputed territory in the East and South China
Seas threatens to spark military conflict, and foreign governments wish
for more clarity in Beijing's longer-term strategic intentions --
specifically, whether it is a "greedy state" that seeks to replace the
United States as regional hegemon. [Glaser proposes solving all of these
problems through a Sino-U.S. "grand bargain":]{.underline} the United
States government "ends its commitment to defend Taiwan" in exchange for
Beijing's promise to "peacefully resolve" its maritime territorial
disputes and "officially accept the United States' long-term military
security role in East Asia." ¶ [The case for abandoning Taiwan typically
meets at least three large barriers: the betrayal of U.S. ideals, harm
to America's reputation as a reliable security partner, and Taiwan's
strategic value. **Glaser's argumentation does not overcome these
barriers.**]{.underline} ¶ Glaser says he recognizes that a foreign
friendly country's hard-won civil liberties "are important values" that
Washington "should be reluctant to jeopardize," but in the end they are
not "key national interests" for the United States and are therefore
expendable. It is debatable that the preservation of a democratic Taiwan
is not a key U.S. interest. Recent U.S. presidential administrations
representing both major political parties have affirmed a U.S. strategic
interest in spreading democracy because democratic countries are
generally supportive of the U.S.-sponsored international system of
liberal norms and institutions. ¶ Glaser focuses on the US interest in
avoiding a war with China. [But what about the U.S. interest in
preventing a Taiwan-China war]{.underline}? One of the main reasons for
U.S. forward deployment is to help keep the region stable. The PRC
argues that the Taiwan "separatist" challenge would quickly dry up if
the U.S. stopped selling weapons to Taiwan, [but Taipei has argued the
opposite: cross-Strait stability is possible only if Taiwan feels
secure, and the Republic of China (ROC) will not negotiate with China
under the gun.]{.underline} Beijing should not assume Taiwan would be
quick to surrender even in a disadvantageous situation. ¶ [Abandoning
staunch, long-time friend like Taiwan would **damage U.S. credibility in
the eyes of other regional governments.**]{.underline} [Glaser argues
that in the case of Japan, this damage would be containable. Tokyo
realizes that compared to Taipei, its relationship with Washington is
more strongly institutionalized.]{.underline} Japan also has nowhere
else to go, he says, other than sticking with the United States. This is
probably true, although [**U.S. abandonment of Taiwan would reinforce
Japan's fear regarding the long-term U.S. reliability to stand up to a
strengthening China**. This would embolden Japanese advocates of
accommodating China, as well as those who call for a militarily strong
Japan unleashed from the alliance.]{.underline} What about the **[damage
to the reputation of the U.S. among friends in Seoul, Canberra, Manila,
and elsewhere]{.underline}**? [Glaser mentions only Tokyo, the
relatively easy case]{.underline}. ¶ On the subject of Taiwan's
strategic value, Glaser spends most of his effort arguing against his
own thesis. He points out that Taiwan acts as a huge barrier, creating
choke points for the deployment of PLA naval forces, while possession of
Taiwan would give the PLAN direct access to the deeper waters of the
Pacific, would increase the Chinese A2/AD capability, would extend the
range of air cover for the Chinese navy, and particularly would make it
easy for Chinese submarines to enter the Philippine Sea and threaten US
carrier battle groups there. Having made these points, Glaser
unconvincingly concludes that controlling Taiwan would not
"significantly increase" Chinese military leverage. ¶ **[Glaser's case
has other weaknesses]{.underline}**. ¶ He assumes that the US
abandonment of Taiwan would "dramatically improve" U.S.-China relations,
and that "China can be very secure with the United States maintaining
its alliances and forward deployment" as long as Taiwan is no longer in
play. This is believable only if we posit that Beijing has no
aspirations for regional leadership or revisions of the current order
beyond gaining control over Taiwan, both now and in the future. ¶ [The
"grand bargain" idea probably resonates less with Beijing than
Washington. From Beijing's point of view, this would be asking it to
trade something it believes it already owns for something else it
believes it already owns.]{.underline} If they did agree, [how the
"bargain" would be operationalized is unclear. What would it mean for
China to "officially accept" U.S. alliances and military bases in the
Asia-Pacific?]{.underline} This would seem to require Beijing to
renounce its proudly "principled" opposition to any country having "Cold
War era" alliances and foreign bases. At the same time, it is easy to
foresee China continuing its pre-bargain activities (military buildup,
maneuvers with Russia, naval patrols in the East and South China Sea,
etc.) while claiming these were not attempts to drive U.S. influence out
of the region. ¶ Glaser recognizes that Chinese leaders may intend to
push out their U.S. rival. He argues his proposal would answer the
question of whether this is Beijing's plan. If Beijing accepts the
proposal, it would indicate that China has limited aims and can tolerate
continued U.S. regional hegemony. If not, China intends to usurp that
role from the United States. If we now recognize that expelling U.S.
strategic leadership may be Beijing's intention, unilaterally assisting
the Chinese by abandoning Taiwan is not the most sensible policy if the
US hopes to retain its accustomed role. The timing of Glaser's proposal
is particularly bad given that Xi Jinping's government seems to
represent a shift toward a more assertive Chinese foreign policy that
has grown impatient with waiting for the United States to decline on its
own. ¶ Even if the current regime in Beijing does not plan to dismantle
U.S. regional leadership, the United States cannot be sure the leaders
of a future, stronger China will think the same way. [China could renege
on Glaser's proposed deal more easily than the US could.]{.underline}
China is a local power with relatively short supply lines to the East
and South China Seas. In the case of the South China Sea, China enjoys a
huge and growing military force projection disparity in its favor
relative to the other claimants. But to cancel its part of the deal, the
United States would have to cross the Pacific Ocean to invade and
capture a Taiwan defended by ensconced PLA forces only 100 miles from
China's mainland. ¶ Ultimately, [Glaser's idea founders on the
contradiction between assuring China and assuring allies who fear
China]{.underline}. Admitting that regional confidence in U.S.
reliability would suffer if Washington stopped supporting Taiwan, Glaser
argues that Washington would need to compensate for this reputational
setback by increasing U.S. military forces in the region, investing in
stronger capabilities, and deepening ties between US and allied military
commands. These compensatory moves, however, would go a long way toward
reviving the very fears that the "grand bargain" was intended to
alleviate. It is questionable that China would feel much more secure if
the price of gaining control over Taiwan was a permanently stronger US
military presence in the region. ¶ Glaser's view of the protection of a
democratic Taiwan as superfluous rather than intrinsic to America's
"longstanding military security role in East Asia" is erroneous.
Therefore a bargaining away of US support for Taiwan -- especially for a
doubtful payoff -- is no way to strengthen America's regional
leadership.

Presidents George W. **[Bush and]{.underline}** Barack **[Obama both
failed to make available to Taiwan the arms needed to mount a credible
self-defense]{.underline}**. President Donald Trump and his team now
have the opportunity to do a better job. It is essential they get off to
a strong start. **[If nothing changes, the long simmering Taiwan Strait
flashpoint is likely to boil over.]{.underline}** It is difficult to
overstate how dysfunctional America's security policy is when it comes
to democratic Taiwan. Despite China's disquieting military buildup and
expansionist posture, **[Washington has increasingly dithered on meeting
its legal and moral commitments to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}**. The
trouble began during the Bush administration, when Washington shocked
Taipei by refusing to accept a letter of request for three squadrons of
new F-16 fighter jets. Things deteriorated further when the Bush White
House proved unable to deliver on its promise to assist Taiwan in
acquiring diesel-electric submarines at a price Taipei's testy
parliament could accept. Even worse, the administration tried to curtail
the Ministry of National Defense's homemade cruise missile project ― a
legitimate capability needed for deterring Chinese ballistic missile
strikes on Taiwan's cities. The **[Obama]{.underline}** administration
**[delivered an even more lackluster performance]{.underline}**. **[It
refused Taiwan's repeated requests for new fighter jets, while actively
marketing low-end, cheap capabilities that seemed calculated to be
inoffensive to China]{.underline}**. In 2014, Taiwan's government, by
now aware of Washington's self-limiting approach to Beijing, proudly
announced its resolve to build its own submarines and invited America to
join other countries in providing selected technical knowhow in a
low-key fashion. The invitation backfired. In response, Obama's team
forbade the American defense industry from competing for access to the
Indigenous Defense Submarine program. They then went on a rhetorical
campaign to erode Taiwan's confidence that it could and should go
forward with the submarine build, which enjoyed widespread bipartisan
support on the island. This was a remarkable reversal of what Pentagon
experts under Clinton and Bush had previously counseled: namely, that
submarines were an ideal asymmetric capability and necessary for
defending against Chinese invasion. **[The absence of top-tier arms
sales to Taiwan]{.underline}** has **[directly contributed to an
imbalanced security situation across the Strait.]{.underline}** The
**[American decisions to withhold support for a next
gen]{.underline}**eration **[Taiwanese air force and navy have
negatively impacted the perceived reliability of the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. This is true **[not just
in Taipei, but also in Tokyo]{.underline}**, **[where the Japanese
foreign policy elite regard Taiwan's fate as tightly intertwined with
their own]{.underline}**. **[China's colossal armaments drive continues
to erode the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}**.
Compounding the problem, the iron-fisted leader of China, Xi Jinping,
has repeatedly hinted that an attack may be just over the horizon. After
his turbulent rise to power in 2012, **[Xi]{.underline}** ramped up
covert actions and coercive operations against Taiwan. More
**[recently]{.underline}**, he **[has sent bombers and warships out on
patrols that circled around the island]{.underline}**. To be clear,
**[there is no chance Taiwan will submit to being ruled by
China]{.underline}**. The Taiwanese people are rightfully proud of their
democratic achievements and unimpressed with Beijing's intimidation
tactics. **[The blessings of self-determination and the power of
nationalism are too deeply rooted for them to back down]{.underline}**.
**[Taiwan and China have had separate governments for 67 years, and this
reality is almost certainly not going to change by 2021, or even by
2049]{.underline}**. But **[a critical question remains: will Taiwan's
free future be secured by the pen or by the sword?]{.underline}** **[To
ensure that cross-strait conflict is averted]{.underline}**, the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[should make available to
Taiwan new fighter jets]{.underline}**, submarine technology, and many
other weapons that have long been off the table. **[Few
things]{.underline}** would **[signal America's]{.underline}** restored
**[strength]{.underline}** and renewed sense of purpose **[to observers
in Asia like frequent and high-caliber arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}**. Yes, China will bluster and complain, but Beijing
will have only itself to blame. If Xi dismantled the offensive missiles
he has pointed at Taiwan and declared his willingness to respect the
will of its 23 million citizens, Taipei would undoubtedly invest its
national resources differently. Unfortunately, the threat is likely to
get much worse. The People's Liberation Army (PLA), the armed wing of
China's Communist Party, has embarked on an ambitious reform program,
with both Taiwan and America in its crosshairs. The PLA intends to
transform itself into a joint fighting force that is capable of invading
and occupying Taiwan while simultaneously defeating the U.S. Pacific
Fleet. This is an extremely tall order. It nonetheless represents a
disturbing indication of intent. PLA reforms will probably take a decade
or more to succeed ― if they can succeed at all. In the meantime, few
options are as likely to make China think twice about the cost of
aggression as bolstered arms sales. To keep the Asia-Pacific region
peaceful and prosperous, the United States needs a well defended and
confident Taiwan. President Trump and his new team have their work cut
out for them. Fixing the policy mistakes of the past will take a
concerted effort. Their prospects will be excellent if they cast off the
legacy they have inherited and chart a new course.

But lately, [there are increasing indications that China is less willing
to wait]{.underline}: Its [military has been operating around the sea
and air approaches to the island]{.underline}; it has been putting very
direct pressure on the nations that still recognize Taiwan to shift
(especially in Latin America and the Caribbean); and it is increasing
economic pressure on the Taiwanese. **[This fits with the more
nationalistic style of President Xi]{.underline}** Jinping [and with
Chinese ambitions to control the South China Sea]{.underline}, the
northern gateway of which passes directly around the island of Taiwan.
What is the best U.S. strategy for dealing with this contentious issue?
First, the Washington must recognize that support for Taiwan is not a
bargaining chip to be put on the table to obtain better outcomes with
mainland China. The U.S. has significant disputes with the People's
Republic over trade imbalances, cyber-intrusions, intellectual property
theft, North Korean bad behavior, and Beijing's territorial claims over
the South China Sea. [It is certainly tempting for the U.S. to use
Taiwan as leverage in dealing with those issues]{.underline}, e.g.
telling China to modulate its positions favorably for the U.S. in return
for lessened U.S. support to the island. When he was president-elect,
Donald Trump mused about doing exactly that, and as the trade dispute
heats up, that temptation will grow. **[That would be a significant
mistake]{.underline}**. [Taiwan has been a steadfast supporter of the
U.S. for decades, and continues to perform as a staunch ally in a very
turbulent and vital geopolitical arena]{.underline}. **[A betrayal of
trust would have a ripple effect globally, further degrading U.S.
credibility as an ally]{.underline}**. [It also misreads Beijing's
intent and attitude]{.underline} --- China has no interest in a deal
involving Taiwan. The [claim to the island is the ultimate red line in
its foreign policy, and it is especially true that a nationalist
government like Xi's will not be part of a negotiation involving
Taiwan's status]{.underline}. The Trump administration must come to
understand the overarching importance China places on eventually
incorporating Taiwan into its governance structure, and display
sophistication and strategic patience with the situation. [This means
following the approach to Taiwan that has been in place for decades with
bipartisan support]{.underline}: **[helping Taiwan militarily with
sensible levels of advanced military sales following the mandate of
the]{.underline}** **[T]{.underline}**aiwan **[R]{.underline}**elations
**[A]{.underline}**ct; providing political support internationally, such
as helping Taiwan participate in international organizations even though
it is not universally recognized as a sovereign state; and encouraging
robust economic exchanges between the two nations. [Good examples of
this are the recent sale of \$1.4 billion in advanced military hardware
that was announced in 2017, and allowing high-level official visits
between the Taiwan and the U.S. as permitted under the Taiwan Travel
Act, which was passed this spring]{.underline}.

**[While angering China has a negative effect of the arms
sales,]{.underline}** **[the importance for the United States that they
continue consistently outweighs it]{.underline}**. By 2011, China had
nearly 2,000 missiles aimed at Taiwan, and more recently in March of
this year, it was revealed that Dongfeng 16 (DF-16) medium range
ballistic missiles were added to the mix of missiles. Most Taiwanese
prefer the current status quo of no independence or reunification.
China's policy of eventual reunification runs counter to this. The
provision of arms by the United States ensures that Taiwan can continue
on its current path, and that it can resist China's attempts at
"Finlandizing" it. **[The status quo has kept the peace between China
and Taiwan, and the arms sales have played a key role in sustaining
this]{.underline}**. Along with U.S. troops in Japan and South Korea,
**[the sales are one of the most visible signs of American commitment to
its allies in the region. The arms sales go beyond verbal support and
show the United States providing an ally with tools of hard
power]{.underline}**. The United States exports arms to several
countries in the region. American weapons account for around 90% of
Japan's weapons imports, 60% of Australia's, 59% of South Korea's and
41% of the Philippines'. **[Each sale holds weight because it signals
this same commitment to them as it does for Taiwan.]{.underline}** The
status quo upheld by the arms deal extends beyond Taiwan. **[Ending an
almost 40 year policy would send shockwaves through the region and could
very well encourage Chinese aggression. If the United States ended the
sale of arms, China and American allies in the region would likely view
it as U.S. appeasement of China]{.underline}**. **[The perceived
weakening of the U.S. could encourage China to take more aggressive
actions, potentially sparking a dangerous crisis.]{.underline}**
Furthermore, **[it could greatly erode the confidence of America's
Asia-Pacific allies, namely South Korea, Japan and the
Philippines]{.underline}**, who all have defense treaties with the U.S.
**[These allies may worry that their own arms deals are in jeopardy and
that the U.S. is not seriously committed to their defense, forcing them
to pursue other options and eroding American influence in the
region]{.underline}**. [The arms sales to Taiwan have been one of the
most consequential foreign policy actions by the United States in recent
history. They have kept the peaceful status quo and have publicly
displayed America's commitment to its allies. With China's continued
rise, the arms sales are more important now than ever before to keep the
tensions in the Asia-Pacific from boiling over.]{.underline}

**[Washington's long-term support for Taiwan also has significance for
U.S. allies and friends.]{.underline}** **[Asian countries which look to
the United States to balance China's rising power may not want
Washington to squander resources and energy on Taiwan, but were it to
conversely ignore Taiwan's security, they would see their own safety
threatened. U.S. credibility, therefore, is at stake. U.S. inconstancy
could convince American allies and friends to rely less on Washington,
undertake an arms race, and/or bandwagon with China.]{.underline}**
**[After the Clinton administration dispatched two aircraft carrier
battle groups to the area around Taiwan in the
1995]{.underline}**---1996 Taiwan Strait crisis, **[the region's
confidence in the United States soared and a wave of counterbalancing
against China occurred. Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, and other
nations all bolstered their security ties with the United
States.]{.underline}** **[Forsaking Taiwan would likely have the
opposite effect]{.underline}**. A U.S. decision to abandon Taiwan
leading to unification of an unwilling Taiwan with China would be
particularly alarming to Japan. Tension between China and Japan remains
high, and the resolution of chronic economic, security, and history
problems in the foreseeable future appears unlikely. Dependent on sea
lanes of supply and communication which pass close to Taiwan, Tokyo
would consider itself to be more vulnerable, and it would be. Japan
would also be outflanked should China decide to use Taiwan as a military
platform. Contested claims to oil fields and islands in the East and
South China Seas would be more difficult to defend. **[If Japan began to
doubt U.S. reliability, that could deal a fatal blow to the U.S.---Japan
alliance. Moreover, adding to Japan's dismay, South Korea, increasingly
reliant on its burgeoning economic ties with China, might calculate that
if the United States can sever ties to Taiwan, Seoul could be safer
renouncing its security alliance with Washington and aligning with
Beijing.]{.underline}** The current urge to seek protection against a
potentially powerful and abusive China has made the United States more
welcome across Southeast Asia. Aware that they cannot effectively hedge
against China without U.S. collaboration, Southeast Asian nations have
quietly repaired rifts and reinvigorated cooperation with Washington.
They welcomed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's declaration in
Thailand in 2009 that ''the United States is back'' in Asia. Although
they don't share Tokyo's view of Taiwan's geostrategic importance, they
do worry about freedom of navigation and resource claims in the South
China Sea. They would likely interpret a shift in U.S. policy away from
Taiwan as a signal of U.S. surrender to Chinese interests, and
eventually follow suit.

Against the backdrop of China's rise as a military power, Taiwan's
defence is often portrayed as a lost cause. However, the Lowy
Institute's Asia Power Index (API) offers insight into why [Taiwan
continues to **deter annexation** by China]{.underline}, [against
seemingly overwhelming odds]{.underline}. The Index also helps explain
how [Taiwan can maintain deterrence beyond a narrow equation of military
power across the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}. The API presents a measure
on military capability. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has 79
major warships to Taiwan's 26. China has 642 fighters to Taiwan's 128,
and 53 submarines to Taiwan's four. [Assuming a smooth military
operation]{.underline}, [the figures suggest China could **overwhelm**
Taiwan's defences with relative ease]{.underline}, [and attain
the]{.underline} air [superiority]{.underline} and sea control [needed
to mount a successful amphibious assault]{.underline}, and/or blockade.
On these figures, Taiwan's position appears hopeless. Yet the [strategic
calculus **changes**]{.underline} [when the API's]{.underline}
"**[alliance force multiplier]{.underline}**" [is
considered]{.underline}. This sub-measure is the ratio of combined
allied military capabilities to a nation's autonomous military
capability. Taiwan's alliance force multiplier is at a very high 5.7,
whereas China's is just 1.5. [Once the]{.underline} "[alliance force
multiplier]{.underline}" [is included]{.underline}, [the balance tilts
in **Taiwan's favour**]{.underline}. Taiwan would have up to 148 major
warships to China's 118, and 730 fighters to 642. The only place where
Taiwan lags is in sea-denial, where China would have 79 submarines to
Taiwan's 23. In short, these [adjusted figures indicate that Taiwan and
the US have enough **firepower**]{.underline} [to inflict **unacceptable
costs**]{.underline} [on the PLA and **deter** an invasion]{.underline}.
[These numbers]{.underline} derived from Taiwan's "alliance force
multiplier" [are based on the assumption that the US would have both the
political resolve and necessary lead time to undertake a rapid and
sustained **mobilisation**]{.underline}, [under the
**T**]{.underline}aiwan **[R]{.underline}**elations
**[A]{.underline}**ct. That is an open question. Moreover, a theoretical
sum of allied military capabilities will likely exceed the effectiveness
of these in coalition on the battlefield. Nevertheless, [Taiwan's task
of deterring China becomes much harder without **allies**]{.underline}.
In light of this, [Taiwan needs to concentrate on shoring up **support
in Washington**]{.underline}, while building on current military
strengths and patching up weaknesses. The current Taiwanese government
seems to understand the need for a stronger military, pledging to
increase defence spending by more than 5%, pushing military spending
above 2% of GDP. Still, challenges remain. The API shows that Taiwan may
have trouble in securing its approaches. Investment in shore-based
anti-ship cruise missiles and submarines should be a priority, while
requests for fast-attack missile boats and minelayers should be approved
swiftly. Taiwan's intelligence and cyber capabilities are also lacking.
Given that only 10% of Taiwan's coastline is suitable for an amphibious
landing by the PLA, further investment in hardening anti-invasion
defences should be another priority, to raise the costs of intervention
for the PLA. Another area where Taiwan's armed forces need modernisation
is in "command and control", a qualitative assessment made by experts on
a nation\'s authority over the armed forces in wartime, where the API
scores Taiwan only 59 out of 100. One possible reason for this low score
is that there are political frictions between the Kuomintang-influenced
military -- with its broad sympathy for re-unification -- and the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. Depoliticising Taiwan's
armed forces would strengthen civilian control over the military, which
would in turn bolster command and control in wartime. President Tsai
Ing-wen's recent speech to the Taiwanese Navy, calling for more
"confidence" and "determination", shows that she is not afraid of
asserting her authority as commander-in-chief. But more needs to be
done. Another factor weakening Taiwan's "command and control" score is
that the armed forces have long been plagued with spies.
Counter-espionage needs greater attention, since the risk of technology
leakage to China limits the quality of hardware the US is prepared to
sell. Recent prosecutions of a former military officer in Kaohsiung and
an engineer for stealing trade secrets for intended use in China suggest
that the Tsai administration recognises the problem. But, again, such
efforts need to be intensified. The Tsai administration's decision to
abolish conscription from 2018 was a much-needed reform to
professionalise the armed forces. However recruiting reserves is still a
significant issue for Taiwan, impacting combat effectiveness. Despite
these teething issues, building reserve capacity while transitioning to
a volunteer force will improve the effectiveness of Taiwan's military in
the long run. Even if the Tsai administration follows this course,
Taiwan will still face significant challenges in deterring Beijing.
China's President Xi Jinping has stated that the People's Republic must
achieve the "great rejuvenation" by 2050, which includes "reunification"
with Taiwan. This resolve, combined with China's mounting cross-strait
political warfare campaign, makes the problem more acute. [To **maintain
deterrence**]{.underline}, [Taiwan needs to **consolidate
ties**]{.underline} [with the US]{.underline} and harden links with
other partners in the Indo-Pacific. Lobbying the US to allow Taiwan into
multinational military exercises, such as RIMPAC, or the Rim of the
Pacific Exercise, would help. Taiwan can also assist Washington by
bolstering its ties with Palau and the Marshall Islands, as a counter to
growing Chinese influence in US "compact states" in Micronesia.
Approving Japan's or India's bids to build Taiwan's next generation
submarines would help too. Wherever possible, [Taiwan must
**strengthen** its **defence networks**]{.underline}.

Relatedly, **[how effectively the United States handles the Taiwan issue
with the PRC could have important consequences for continued U.S.
leadership in Asia and possibly around the world. The U.S. commitment to
democracy, its history of relations with and support for Taiwan, and
Taiwan's importance as a U.S. "defense and intelligence partner,"12
according to some, significantly raise the stakes of a U.S. policy
"failure."]{.underline}** **[If U.S. officials are seen as unable to
manage the cross-strait issue in a way that avoids a coercive PRC
approach to Taiwan, then U.S. regional leadership might be questioned
and support for it undermined.]{.underline}** Likewise, if the United
States is seen to be accommodating to PRC interests in absorbing
democratic Taiwan, U.S. friends and allies in Asia could view the United
States as a weaker power and less reliable than in the past. Asian
democracies and smaller Asian nations could decide that the United
States is not likely to be there for them in the event of hostile action
from China. They and American Asian allies may be inclined to
recalculate their own political and economic alignments in such a way
that would give more weight to PRC concerns, creating a "geopolitical
realignment in the Western Pacific."13 For instance, PRC absorption of
Taiwan might well spur Japan's military rearmament --- possibly
including the consideration of building nuclear weapons --- and possibly
raise other questions in Japan about the reliability of the U.S. shield.
Taiwan's absorption into the PRC also would expand the PRC's naval-air
projection into the Western Pacific and potentially key sea-lanes
important to Japan.

First, the Trump administration has articulated an Asia policy of a
'Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy'. While the details of this
strategy remain unspecified with clarity needed in several areas, the
fundamental premise is to ensure that states straddling the Indian and
Pacific Oceans remain free from coercion. [Abandoning
Taiwan]{.underline} --- ostensibly an Indo-Pacific territory with a
vibrant democracy and successive governments that espouse universal
human rights --- **[would denigrate the credibility of the
administration's Indo-Pacific policy as it runs counter to the
principles of deterring coercion and promoting freedom of governance and
fundamental rights.]{.underline}** This is particularly damaging as the
source of coercion is China --- a state with communism enshrined in its
constitution and a less-than-stellar human rights record. Second,
**[discontinuing]{.underline}** its **[backing of Taiwan would severely
erode the current balance of power in Asia]{.underline}**. Beijing's
ongoing moves at consolidating control over its disputed periphery,
including militarising its installations in the South China Sea, hint at
a paradigm shift in the way it is utilising its new-found national power
in the diplomatic, economic and military spheres. While Beijing
constantly decries Washington's 'Cold War mentality' in creating spheres
of influence in China's immediate neighbourhood, the reality is that
states in the vicinity of the middle kingdom want a choice --- instead
of bandwagoning to Beijing's preferences. **[The United States provides
this choice, allowing states to hedge their bets between the global
hegemon and Asia's rising power. But the United States' role in
balancing China in Asia is credible only insofar as it can maintain the
trust and confidence of its treaty allies --- such as Japan, South Korea
and Australia --- and partners like India and Vietnam. Abandoning Taiwan
to China's coercion would decimate this trust.]{.underline}**

THE PERILS OF IGNORING POLITICS Furthermore, [Glaser's proposed grand
bargain is politically infeasible]{.underline}. For accommodation over
Taiwan to purchase the peaceful rise of China, Chinese aims should be
limited (doubtful), integration with Taiwan should be peaceful
(uncertain), and relevant actors would have to play along with the
strategic bargain (extremely unlikely). Glaser explains that he is
"bounding the analysis" (p. 52), but [excluding the role of actors other
than the U.S. and Chinese leaderships produces unrealistic and even
counterproductive recommendations]{.underline}.21 [Glaser's analysis
**ignores the role of Taiwan**]{.underline}---a free society of more
than 23 million--- [and makes no mention of identity and political
preferences on the island]{.underline}. Comparing data from 1994 and
2014 reveals that more and more citizens self-identify as Taiwanese
(20.2 percent to 60.6 percent), fewer identify as both Taiwanese and
Chinese (44.6 percent to 32.5 percent), and the number identifying as
Chinese has plummeted (26.2 percent to 3.5 percent).22 The Ma Ying-jeou
administration's policy of economic integration---culminating in the
first-ever cross-strait summit when President Ma met President Xi
Jinping in Singapore in November 2015---was greeted with intense
domestic skepticism. The recent "Sunflower Movement" against economic
integration with China, student protests against proposed China-friendly
revisions to history textbooks, and suspicion of Chinese intentions
after observing the Hong Kong experience under "one country, two
systems" all suggest that [a U.S.-China grand bargain would be
**actively** **resisted** by myriad actors on Taiwan. If decisionmakers
in Taipei seriously feared subjugation to Beijing, they might look to
defend their democracy with legal measures to **strengthen** Taiwan's de
facto **independence**]{.underline}23 [or additional deterrent
capabilities]{.underline}, \[End Page 182\] **[not limited to
conventional means]{.underline}**.24 [Accommodating assertive Chinese
nationalism could hasten such outcomes]{.underline}; better for Beijing
to accommodate subnational identities, in Hong Kong and elsewhere, to
demonstrate good faith and soft power to Taiwan.25 [Glaser]{.underline}
not only sets aside Taiwan's ability to affect outcomes; he [does not
consider the roles of other states in Asia. Japanese, Indian, and
Southeast Asian strategists doubt that China's territorial goals are
limited, based on their observation of China's expanding power
projection capabilities and resource needs]{.underline}. Glaser writes
that Taiwan is the only dispute important enough to bring the United
States and China into conflict, but [the divided Korean Peninsula
remains an area where the two could clash]{.underline} in, for example,
a contingency precipitated by a North Korean attack or a race to secure
nuclear weapons and fissile material during post-collapse stabilization
missions. When political change comes to North Korea, China should be
integral to processes of peaceful denuclearization, economic
integration, and eventual unification, but Washington's interests will
be tied to close cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo. It would be extremely
counterproductive if damaged U.S. credibility motivated leaders in
Beijing to expect (and those in Seoul and Tokyo to fear) a U.S.-China
deal to seal the fate of Korea. [Abandonment of Taiwan would be a
greater **shock for U.S. credibility**]{.underline} than the 2008
financial crisis, Arab Spring, Syrian civil war, or Ukrainian conflict
[because it would contradict decades of U.S. policy, be a sin of
commission rather than omission, and have greater direct relevance to
Asia's geopolitics. A grand bargain with China would not only **degrade
U.S. soft power and alliances**; it could drive Asian countries to
**unilaterally enhance their own defenses, fueling an arms race** and
further diminishing security in the region. Glaser suggests that such
dynamics could be avoided if U.S. leaders visit Japan and South Korea
with security treaties]{.underline} in hand and clarify why those
countries are different from Taiwan. [Alliances among democracies are
based **not only on treaties** and national interests]{.underline},
however, **[but also on shared values and popular
support]{.underline}**. [**Perceptions of reliability** affect how
people vote and can redirect democratic processes behind alliance
cooperation.]{.underline} Glaser's decision not to consider U.S.
domestic politics is also problematic. The article focuses on what
Glaser thinks are U.S. national interests, rather than on what different
political parties, branches of government, businesses, civil society
groups, and bureaucratic stakeholders consider U.S. interests. Putting
aside the moral failings of disregarding U.S.-Taiwan historical
commitments, shared values, and human rights, treating Taiwan as a
tradable commodity in great power bargaining is a nonstarter in U.S.
politics. [Quid pro quo accommodation of China would be resisted in
Congress as]{.underline} \[End Page 183\] [appeasement or overturned by
a subsequent administration]{.underline}. Choosing not to look inside
the "black box" of U.S. foreign policy interests, [Glaser discounts the
**bipartisan consensus**]{.underline}, upheld over five administrations,
[to support Taiwan]{.underline} to an extent that maintains regional
stability.26 U.S. policy stresses that a political settlement between
China and Taiwan must be decided peacefully and with the assent of the
Taiwanese people. [Supporting Taiwan is]{.underline} thus not only about
preventing conflict, but also [about showing people on the mainland that
Chinese democracy is possible]{.underline}. As more mainlanders visit
Taiwan and witness its freedoms, they return home asking why they do not
enjoy similar rule of law. This interaction demonstrates how Glaser's
version of U.S. grand strategy in Asia--- staying in the region with
strong alliances---is incomplete. The National Security Strategy,
Quadrennial Defense Review, and other official [statements include the
defense of international norms]{.underline}.27 Such [norms and values
are essential for linking major components of U.S. strategy:
legitimizing forward deployment, bringing together allies and regional
institutions, and setting standards for China's peaceful
rise.]{.underline}

Sixth-century Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu wrote that "to fight
and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme
excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without
fighting." Sun Tzu, skeptical about prolonged warfare, favored swift,
decisive action; he preferred deception and psychological warfare to
subduing an enemy by force. Contemporary Chinese rulers sometimes
breathe the same strategic air as their distinguished forebear. The
Peoples' Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has dispatched warships into the
Taiwan Strait and conducted live-fire drills. On more than one occasion,
its Xian H-6 bombers have circumnavigated Taiwan; in early summer, a
Chinese destroyer and frigate repeated that circumnavigation by sea. And
[Beijing has not renounced the use of **force** to seize
Taiwan]{.underline}. A Chinese military analyst and TV personality told
one of Beijing's state-run media outlets that it is "legitimate" for
China "to send strong signals like this," and that it must be able to
deal not only with Taiwan's military but potential U.S. and Japanese
intervention. This is foolish talk. Taiwan possesses 1.6 percent of the
mainland's population; by the most generous estimate, Taiwan's defense
budget is one-twentieth of China's; the U.S. and Japan would use force
against China only if Beijing initiated hostilities. Like Mikhail
Gorbachev, who knew NATO would not invade the former Soviet Union, Xi
Jinping understands that neither Taiwan, nor the U.S. and Japan, nor any
combination of these represents a military threat to the People's
Republic of China (PRC). [China's increasing military exercises are
intended to convince the Taiwanese that resisting is
useless]{.underline}. Sun Tzu would approve: China seeks to achieve its
objective --- the absorption of democratic Taiwan into authoritarian
China --- by frightening and bullying. Yet, [China]{.underline} also [is
increasing the **amphibious forces**]{.underline} [needed to put ground
troops ashore]{.underline}. Since 2007 it has constructed five
amphibious ships similar in size and capability to the U.S. Navy's
25,000-ton USS San Antonio-class LPD (landing platform dock); the
Chinese vessels carry up to 800 troops each, along with landing craft
and armored vehicles. [It is building several larger **amphibious
ships**]{.underline} (40,000 tons), the first of which is to launch in
2020. [China is]{.underline} going about **[intimidating
Taiwan]{.underline}** purposefully. [The list of provocative behavior is
long]{.underline}: [a **build-up** of armaments that can be used
specifically to **attack Taiwan**]{.underline}; [sea and air
**exercises** targeted at Taiwan]{.underline}; [**unilaterally
expanding** its air-defense zone]{.underline}; [sustained efforts to
**isolate** Taiwan diplomatically]{.underline}; Xi Jinping's 2017
statement to China's 19th Party Congress that the "Taiwan problem" is
part of his plan for "national rejuvenation." [All point to **increasing
pressure** on Taiwan's democratic institutions and
sovereignty]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has a **large interest**]{.underline} [in helping Taiwan remain
sovereign]{.underline} --- [not only because of its **democratic
institutions**]{.underline} [or its **strategic place** in the **island
chain** bracketing China's east coast]{.underline}. [We are committed by
the **T**aiwan **R**elations **A**ct]{.underline} of 1979 [to provide
equipment]{.underline} and services [Taiwan needs to defend
itself]{.underline}. **[Deterring China]{.underline}** [is the best
means to **lower tensions**]{.underline} [and reduce the possibility
that Beijing might decide to **use force**]{.underline} --- [but U.S.
policy]{.underline} in recent years [has alternated between good and
dubious]{.underline}. An example of the former is Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo's July 30 speech restating U.S. commitment to protect
sovereignty in the region "from coercion by other countries," backed by
a pledge of \$300 million for Indo-Pacific security. Also on the
positive side was last month's transit of the Taiwan Strait by guided
missile destroyers USS Mustin and USS Benfold, reminding China that the
U.S. remains committed to regional stability and Taiwan's safety. More
such transits are needed --- as is overall administration policy as
tough-minded about defense as it is about trade. China is not likely to
regard the dispatch of an occasional naval vessel as serious American
support for Taiwan and the region. An American aircraft carrier has not
transited the Taiwan Strait since the USS Kitty Hawk, 11 years ago.
China would react with predictable sound and fury if the Trump
administration sailed a carrier through the strait. But the broad
midsection of the 110-mile-wide strait is international waters, and U.S.
policy has long insisted on a legal right to sail unrestricted on the
high seas. Another action to underline American support for Taiwan is
noted in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA); it
specifically expresses Congress's sense that the administration should
order Navy ships to call in Taiwanese ports. [Congress understands the
**geographic centrality** of Taiwan in the First Island
Chain]{.underline}, [along with the large strategic value of a free
Taiwan in preserving **America's position** as a **great power** in the
West Pacific]{.underline}. The 2018 NDAA also supports bilateral
exercises with Taiwan's navy and exchanges of senior military officers;
this strengthens the ties between Washington and Taipei that improve the
interoperability of their military forces. If the Trump administration
listens, [Congress's **expressed interest**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} such [other measures as regular **arms sales** to
Taiwan]{.underline} --- including substantial assistance to help Taiwan
build its own submarines and other equipment needed to defend against
China's growing arsenal --- [will help **deter** the PRC from
precipitous action as well as intimidation]{.underline}. As demonstrated
by the 2018 National Defense Strategy, the Trump administration regards
China as a "strategic competitor." While the result of tariffs on
Chinese goods remains unknown, economic competition between the U.S. and
China is central to their broader contest. And China is challenging the
U.S.'s technological edge; for example, its \$10 billion investment in a
quantum computing research facility in Hefei dwarfs the approximately
\$250 million of annual U.S. federal spending on the same technology,
which has extraordinary potential for the security and economy of
whichever country holds the whip hand. In this competitive relationship,
[Taiwan's security remains a large portion of America's interest in
**future stability** in the **West Pacific**]{.underline}. [The U.S.
will]{.underline} [benefit]{.underline} itself and its regional friends
[by increasing]{.underline} its **[tangible commitment]{.underline}**
[to Taiwan]{.underline} and the region, [in concert with the Trump
administration's]{.underline} **[correct understanding]{.underline}**
[that China is a threat to American and allied interests]{.underline}.
Alongside his advice on using means other than force to achieve a
political objective, Sun Tzu noted that "the opportunity of defeating an
enemy is provided by the enemy himself." [China's willingness to use
force demonstrates the **enmity** it holds for Taiwan]{.underline}. [By
increasing the **deterrent value**]{.underline} [of
Taiwan's]{.underline} [defenses]{.underline} and those of our other
allies in the region, [the U.S. and Taiwan help deny the PRC the
opportunity to accomplish its goal by threat or by force]{.underline}.

### 2NC Overview 

#### Cross-Strait tensions are building -- only deterrence solves.

**Mazza 18** \[Michael, writer for The American Interest, "The Coming
Crisis in the Taiwan Strait," accessible online at

"The people's eyes are sharp. Whether this disputed issue can be
resolved is an important indicator of how Taiwan people will view the
future direction of relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait." So said Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council in a statement issued
on January 31. The not-so-subtle warning to Beijing: Change course or
say goodbye to your dream of unification. This MAC statement was
specifically in reference to China's then-recent unilateral announcement
of new commercial flight routes over the Taiwan Strait, but it can also
be understood as a response to China's two-year pressure campaign on the
island. [With the election of Tsai]{.underline} Ing-wen to Taiwan's
presidency in early 2016, [Beijing]{.underline} wisely [concluded that
its previous charm strategy for bringing about unification had
failed]{.underline}. During the previous Ma Ying-jeou Administration, Hu
Jintao had pursued cross-Strait economic agreements, the obvious
rationale being that economic integration would increase the island's
economic reliance on the mainland, eventually making unification
inevitable. The people on Taiwan would see the benefits, especially
economic, of embracing the People's Republic and recognize that future
attempts to distance themselves from China would hit them where it seems
in normal times to hurt most---in their pocketbooks. At the same time,
Beijing permitted Taiwan a tad more international space; for example, it
didn't object when Singapore and New Zealand pursued their own
free-trade agreements with Taiwan, nor did it object to Taiwan's
participation as an observer in the World Health Assembly. [Perhaps to
Beijing's surprise]{.underline}, [the charm approach did not
work]{.underline}. If anything, [familiarity bred greater
contempt]{.underline}. From the perspective of many in Taiwan, the
Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA)---a pseudo-FTA between
Beijing and Taipei---did not live up to its promise, with GDP growth
below 2 percent for most of Ma's tenure. Indeed, [many in
Taiwan]{.underline}, especially among the younger generations, [were
suspicious of tightening cross-Strait ties during Ma's second
term]{.underline}. When the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) moved to speed the
Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement through the legislature in March
2014, students and civic groups occupied the Legislative Yuan's
chambers. A March 30 rally attracted more than 100,000 people (116,000
according to police; half a million according to organizers) marching in
support of passing a law governing cross-Strait agreements before
considering the trade-in-services pact. At the least, [the]{.underline}
so-called [Sunflower Movement slowed the pace of cross-Strait economic
integration]{.underline}. Perhaps more importantly, [it presaged
significant electoral setbacks for the KMT in the nine-in-one
elections]{.underline}---local polls for a variety of leadership
positions, from village chiefs to big-city mayors---later that year and
in the 2016 general election. [Following the general
election]{.underline}, [the Democratic Progressive Party for the first
time in Taiwan's history captured both the presidency and the
legislature]{.underline}. [Beijing attempted to dictate terms to Taipei
regarding the basis upon which it would engage with the new Tsai
government]{.underline} going forward. [But Tsai would not be dictated
to]{.underline}---after all, she has voters to whom she must answer.
[China has acted like a **petulant child** in the two years since that
election]{.underline}, [but that understates the seriousness of Chinese
behavior]{.underline}. [China's **pressure campaign** may be more
sophisticated]{.underline} now [than it was during the]{.underline}
1995-96 **[Taiwan Strait Crisis]{.underline}**, when its missile
launches bracketing the island both failed to sway Taiwanese voters and,
ultimately, demonstrated Beijing's strategic impotence in the face of
the undaunted U.S. commitment to the island's defense. [Although it has
not recently resorted to displays of force]{.underline}, [its bite today
can]{.underline} more closely [match its bark]{.underline}. Beijing's
Frustration Beijing has long looked askance at the Democratic
Progressive Party, which Tsai Ing-wen leads, primarily because it has
not shared the Kuomintang's commitment to eventual unification of the
island with the mainland. Chen Shui-bian, the first DPP candidate to be
elected President of the Republic of China (Taiwan), openly considered a
referendum on the island's sovereignty, leading to a nadir in both
cross-Strait and U.S.-Taiwan relations. More generally, the DPP holds
that the Republic of China on Taiwan is an independent sovereign state
and, therefore, a formal declaration of independence is unnecessary.
Unlike the KMT, [the DPP rejects the]{.underline} "['92
consensus]{.underline}."1 [This has **deeply frustrated**
Xi]{.underline} Jinping. [Despite Tsai's]{.underline} oft-repeated
[commitment to upholding the cross-Strait **status
quo**]{.underline}---an eminently responsible position given the DPP's
history---[Beijing harbors **suspicions** that her true goal is formal
independence]{.underline}. [Evidence to support that contention is
**flimsy**]{.underline}, [but that hasn't stopped China from deriding
the Taiwanese President]{.underline}. Indeed, given Chinese suspicions,
Tsai's inaugural address should have been reassuring. She contended that
"stable and peaceful development of the cross-Strait relationship"
should be advanced based upon "existing realities and political
foundations," which she went on to define in terms meant to offer an
olive branch to Beijing without betraying Taiwan's populace: By existing
political foundations, I refer to a number of key elements. The first
element is the fact of the 1992 talks between the two institutions
representing each side across the Strait (SEF & ARATS), when there was
joint acknowledgement of setting aside differences to seek common
ground. This is a historical fact. The second element is the existing
Republic of China constitutional order. The third element pertains to
the outcomes of over twenty years of negotiations and interactions
across the Strait. And the fourth relates to the democratic principle
and prevalent will of the people of Taiwan. The authorities in Beijing,
no doubt, found the fourth principle troubling, but as President of a
freewheeling democratic polity, she couldn't very well leave it out.
Beijing, however, found it impossible to take (from its perspective) the
bad with the very good: namely, the emphasis on the "existing" Republic
of China constitution, in which the national boundaries are defined in
accordance with those of "one China."2 China's Taiwan Affairs Office
described Tsai's speech as an "incomplete test answer." According to the
TAO spokesman, in order to pass Beijing's test, Tsai would have to
confirm "adherence to the common political foundation of the 1992
consensus that embodies the one-China principle." Tsai has not done so,
and is unlikely to change her mind. [Beijing's
frustrations]{.underline}, however, run deeper. They do not [stem
from]{.underline} having to deal with one particular leader or party;
they have more to do with [Taiwanese society itself]{.underline}. First,
long-term trends are not in China's favor. Since 1992, surveys have
tracked how the people of Taiwan self-identify and their attitudes
toward independence and unification. Put simply, since 1992, the share
of those surveyed identifying as "Taiwanese" has grown from 17.6 percent
to 55.3 percent---hitting a high of 60.6 percent in 2014 during the Ma
Administration---while the share of respondents identifying as either
"Both Taiwanese and Chinese" (37.3 percent, down from 46.4 percent in
1992) or "Chinese" (3.7 percent, down from 25.5 percent in 1992) has
dropped. Accordingly, [the shares of those favoring
unification]{.underline}, whether as soon as possible or eventually,
[have **decreased**]{.underline}, [while the shares of respondents
favoring independence]{.underline} (again, either as soon as possible or
eventually) [have grown]{.underline}. [Support for maintaining the
status quo has grown as well]{.underline}. [Beijing's efforts to shape
the behavior and views of the people on Taiwan]{.underline}, moreover,
[have largely **failed**]{.underline}. In 1996, China bracketed Taiwan
with missile tests in hopes of dissuading citizens from casting their
votes for Lee Teng-hui in the island's first direct presidential
election. In the event, turnout was 76 percent, with Lee winning in a
landslide. The downturn in cross-Strait ties during the Chen years was
one reason for the KMT's presidential victory during the 2008 election,
but that victory did nothing to forestall larger trends in Taiwanese
society. Rather, the growth in the share of survey respondents
identifying as "Taiwanese" accelerated during the Ma years. As noted,
discomfiture with tightening cross-Strait ties rose to the surface
during 2014's Sunflower Movement and is a significant factor in Tsai
Ing-wen's 2016 victory. [The past two decades of Chinese strategy with
respect to Taiwan have shown Beijing that Taiwan's people are not easily
intimidated and that]{.underline}---confounding to Chinese leaders, no
doubt---[economic self-interest is not a primary factor in determining
the type of relationship the people of Taiwan seek with their neighbors
across the Strait]{.underline}. If Taiwan's people cannot be scared into
submission or bought off, if they do not understand Chinese leniency as
magnanimity, then what is the best way to bring about peaceful (even if
coerced) unification? Beijing lacks an answer to that question; indeed,
[Beijing seems to have little idea how to deal with a democracy such as
Taiwan]{.underline}---[and therein lies the problem]{.underline}. Xi
Jinping's China Dream [The **ineffectiveness**]{.underline} [of
Beijing's approaches for Taiwan]{.underline} thus far [have been laid
bare at a time when **unification** is perhaps becoming **more
important** to the Chinese leadership]{.underline}. [Since]{.underline}
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping['s]{.underline} [declaration]{.underline} in
2012 [that]{.underline} "[to realize the great renewal of the Chinese
nation is the greatest dream for the Chinese nation in modern
history]{.underline}," [it has become clear that Xi is a leader **cut
from a different cloth** than his immediate predecessors]{.underline}.
Through a crackdown on civil society entailing a re-extension of state
power, a years-long anti-corruption campaign at times indistinguishable
from an old-fashioned purge, and a more assertive foreign policy, [Xi
has sought to **strengthen** the role of the CCP at home and his own
role within it]{.underline}, [and from that base to **enhance** PRC
**power abroad**]{.underline}. At the same time, Xi Jinping has made
some big promises. In his work report to the 19th Party Congress last
November, Xi asserted that by mid-century the CCP would "develop China
into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong,
democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful." The Chinese
economy, however, may well enter a protracted period of stagnation.
Slowing growth, soaring debt, demographic challenges, and the central
role of the CCP and of state-owned enterprises in the economy all point
to significant headwinds. As Dan Blumenthal and Derek Scissors argue,
"Absent powerful pro-market reform that is nowhere in sight, true
economic growth will halt by the end of this decade, no matter what the
government claims." [To the extent that Xi cannot deliver on promises of
widening prosperity]{.underline}, [his other targets become **more
important**]{.underline}. As such, [his comments on **military
power**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} on **[Taiwan]{.underline}** to
the 19th Party Congress [take on **added significance**]{.underline}.
Regarding the former, Xi asserted, "We will make it our mission to see
that by 2035, the modernization of our national defense and our forces
is basically completed; and that by the mid-21st century our people's
armed forces have been fully transformed into world-class forces." [With
respect to Taiwan]{.underline}, [Xi explained that Taipei's acceptance
of the]{.underline} '92 consensus and the "[One China]{.underline}"
[principle is a **precondition** for the]{.underline} "peaceful
[development]{.underline}" [of cross-Strait relations]{.underline} and
for cross-Strait dialogue. Then, in what was one of the biggest applause
lines of his speech, Xi drew a line in the sand: We stand firm in
safeguarding China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will
never allow the historical tragedy of national division to repeat
itself. Any separatist activity is certain to meet with the resolute
opposition of the Chinese people. We have the resolve, the confidence,
and the ability to defeat separatist attempts for "Taiwan independence"
in any form. We will never allow anyone, any organization, or any
political party, at any time or in any form, to separate any part of
Chinese territory from China! In case there were any doubts, Xi made
clear that unification was inextricable from his animating vision of the
"China Dream": Realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is a
dream shared by all of us as Chinese. We remain firm in our conviction
that, as long as all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation,
including our compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, follow the
tide of history, work together for the greater national interests, and
keep our nation's destiny firmly in our own hands, we will, without
doubt, be able to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
In time, [Xi's definition of national rejuvenation may increasingly
**emphasize** what might be called]{.underline}
"**[external]{.underline}**" **[efforts]{.underline}**---[securing
contested **territory**]{.underline}, [**unification** with
Taiwan]{.underline}, [**influence** abroad]{.underline}, **[military
power]{.underline}**---as the Chinese economy stalls. Indeed, [the
beginnings of such a shift have likely **already
occurred**]{.underline}. [China has]{.underline} proven an ability to
sustain pressure on Japan around the disputed Senkaku Islands, has made
remarkable progress in securing its position in the South China Sea, and
[launched an unrelenting **pressure campaign** on Taiwan]{.underline}
for which it has, thus far, faced few if any consequences. The Pressure
Campaign Beijing met Tsai Ing-wen's election with harsh words. China's
Taiwan Affairs Office promised to "resolutely oppose any form of
separatist activities seeking 'Taiwan independence.'" The TAO affirmed,
"We are willing to strengthen contact and exchange with any parties and
groups that recognize that the two sides belong to one China." In other
words, Beijing would not engage with the ruling DPP. Beijing's first
shot across the bow came two months later, two months before Tsai's
inauguration. In 2013, Gambia, one of Taiwan's few remaining diplomatic
allies, broke ties with Taiwan and offered to recognize the People's
Republic as the sole government of China. Beijing's role in this is
uncertain---though it is difficult to believe the Chinese government
lacked advance warning---but in any case, China rejected the offer. Ma
Ying-jeou was still President and cross-Strait relations remained
amicable, at least on the surface. Thus the CCP pocketed a weapon it
could withdraw at any moment. That moment came in March 2016, when
Gambia and the PRC established formal diplomatic relations. Then, in
June, another shoe dropped: Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office announced
the suspension of the cross-Strait communication mechanism "because
Taiwan did not recognize the 1992 Consensus, the political basis for the
One China principle." Taipei and Beijing have several channels through
which to communicate, but China's decision to cut off this more-or-less
official conduit (to Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council) sent an
unmistakable signal: Our way or the highway. It also suggested that
Beijing might now tolerate higher risk in crisis management. Next,
Beijing went after Taiwan's economy. Ma Ying-jeou had opened Taiwan to
tourism from China; now, China would keep its tourists away from the
island. In the five months following Tsai's inauguration, the number of
tourists from China fell by 27.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Businesses catering specifically to mainland tourists suffered. But
despite the drop-off in Chinese visitors, Taiwan had a banner year for
tourism in 2016. Southeast Asia, in particular, was a growth market, and
for the first time Taipei permitted visa-free entry for travelers from
Thailand and Brunei (joining Singapore and Malaysia), while simplifying
the visa application process for other Southeast Asian countries. Still,
China's immediate resort to the coercive use of economic leverage---in
response to nothing more than Tsai's refusal to utter a few
words---raised concerns soon borne out when China eventually began
destroying some imports of food products from Taiwan that were not
labeled as made in "Taiwan Area" or "Taiwan Area, China." The hits kept
coming. In December 2016, Taiwan severed diplomatic ties with São Tomé
and Príncipe. According to Taiwan's Foreign Minister at the time, David
Lee, São Tomé "disregarded its nearly 20-year friendship with us and
approached both sides of the Taiwan Strait to seek the highest bidder."
China was quick to reestablish diplomatic relations with the island
nation just five days after Minister Lee's announcement of the
severance. In a statement, the Foreign Ministry laid much of the blame
for the switch on Beijing. The following month, Nigeria forced Taiwan to
move its trade mission---essentially an unofficial embassy---out of its
capital city. The move came as the Nigerian Foreign Minister, following
a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, announced that "Taiwan will stop
enjoying any privileges because it is not a country that is recognized
under international law. . . . \[W\]e have taken decision \[sic\] to
abide by One China Policy \[sic\]." Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi
announced \$40 billion of investments during his visit. In case there
were any lingering doubts, [it became clear in June 2017 that the
PRC-Taiwan diplomatic truce was truly **dead**]{.underline}. [That
month]{.underline}, [Panama]{.underline}---[one of Taiwan's largest
remaining diplomatic allies]{.underline}---[embraced
Beijing's]{.underline} "[One China]{.underline}" [principle and
established relations with the PRC]{.underline}. Taiwan's Foreign
Minister had little doubt that Beijing was behind this development and
was not shy about saying so. [That interference appears set to
**continue**]{.underline}. Taiwanese leaders feared that Panama might be
the first of several Latin American dominoes to fall, and so it was. The
Dominican Republic cut ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic
relations with the PRC in late April of this year; others in the region
are looking wobbly. Less than a month after the Dominican Republic's
decision, Burkina Faso ended its formal relationship with Taiwan,
leaving it only one diplomatic ally in Africa. Even more concerning is
the Vatican's recent outreach to Beijing, for the Holy See's decisions
carry moral weight. Pope Francis, however, seems intent on
reestablishing diplomatic relations with Beijing, a move sure to deal a
symbolic blow to Taiwan's international standing in a way that Gambia's
de-recognition could not. At times, [Chinese attempts to ensure that
Taiwan is not accorded nationhood look quite **petty**]{.underline}.
Since the turn of the year, [Chinese media have **blasted**
international corporations for not strictly adhering to
Beijing's]{.underline} "**[One China]{.underline}**"
[principle]{.underline}. Gap, the clothing retailer, was made to
apologize for selling a t-shirt that featured a map of China that did
not include Taiwan, Arunachel Pradesh (an Indian state claimed by
China), and the nine-dash line in the South China Sea. Gap was selling
the t-shirt in Canada. Marriott, Zara, and nearly 40 international
airlines (including Delta, United, and American Airlines) have found
themselves in the crosshairs for including Taiwan (and, in some cases,
Tibet) on lists of countries where they conduct business. Some targeted
companies were quick to update their websites and issue apologies. The
Marriott CEO's apology is representative: Marriott International
respects and supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
China. We don't support anyone who subverts the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of China and we do not intend in any way to
encourage or incite any such people or groups. We recognize the severity
of the situation and sincerely apologize. Marriott's embrace of Chinese
talking points is distasteful, but not surprising given its business
interests in China. It is also difficult to criticize when even U.S.
government agencies are taking steps to mollify the CCP. Last year, the
Department of State and the U.S. Trade Representative began taking down
Taiwan's flag from their websites---despite the fact that State websites
continued to include the flags of North Korea and Iran, with which the
United States does not maintain diplomatic relations, and despite the
fact that USTR's continued inclusion of the Hong Kong and Macao flags is
apparently considered consistent with the "One China" policy. [Beijing's
efforts to **limit** Taiwan's]{.underline} "**[international
presence]{.underline}**," moreover, have extended beyond the poaching of
diplomatic allies. In May 2016, the World Health Organization invited
Taiwan to send a delegation to the annual World Health Assembly (WHA) as
observers, as Taiwan had done for the previous seven years. That
invitation, however, came with a threat from Beijing: "Taiwan has been
able to attend WHA since 2009 under a special arrangement made on the
political basis that both Taipei and Beijing uphold the '1992
Consensus.' In future, if this political basis for cross-Strait ties is
destroyed, it will be hard to continue this arrangement."
Unsurprisingly, Taipei's efforts to secure invitations to the 2017 and
2018 assemblies were futile. Taiwan was likewise barred from attending
as mere observers the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO)
triennial assembly in the autumn of 2016 and from attending Interpol's
annual meetings in 2016 and 2017. That exclusion from ICAO took on added
significance in January 2018, when China unilaterally announced new
civilian flight paths over the Taiwan Strait in contravention of a
previous 2015 agreement. In 2015, China announced five new routes over
the Strait without consulting the Ma Ying-jeou Administration. Following
Taipei's objections, both sides agreed only to establish the M503,
running just west of the Taiwan Strait's median line, and open it only
to southbound traffic. At that time, Taipei and Beijing agreed that they
would host prior consultations before inaugurating new routes.
Fast-forward to January, when Beijing did exactly what it promised not
to do: open the M503 to northbound traffic and also establishing three
west-east feeder routes to the M503 from Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Dongshan.
Taiwan has raised concerns of both safety---the new routes run by
Taiwan's offshore islands, which have their own airports---and security.
In particular, those responsible for ensuring Taiwan's security worry
that PLA aircraft may take advantage of the new routes to approach the
island under the guise of commercial airliners. The W122 feeder route
from Fuzhou---in what is unlikely to be a mere coincidence---appears to
coincide with the shortest distance between Taipei and the mainland. The
W122 and the W123 feeder routes, moreover, align with the flight paths
PLA aircraft might follow to provide air cover for ships sailing across
the Strait from naval bases at Fuzhou and Xiamen. If the W123 were
extended across the Strait, it would pass by the Pescadores (a group of
Taiwanese offshore islands) and Kaohsiung (one of the world's top-15
container ports). Moreover, [should the PLA ever launch an **invasion**
and successfully establish a beachhead on Taiwan]{.underline}, [Beijing
is likely to use **civilian airliners** as complements to military
transport]{.underline} [in order to ferry people and supplies across the
Strait]{.underline}; civilian pilots using the newly announced air
routes would be, in effect, training for an invasion. [China is
**unsettling** the security environment in the Taiwan Strait with little
regard for the safety of civil aviation]{.underline}. At the same time,
ICAO's failure to respond to China's actions has made plain Taiwan's
isolation on the international stage. China's challenge to Taiwan's
security goes beyond the imposition of potential dual-use civilian air
traffic routes. The pressure campaign has had a clear military component
as well. The PLA's sole aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, sailed through
the Taiwan Strait at least three times in 2017. Its first transit in
January of that year came after the Liaoning first sailed into the
Western Pacific via the Miyako Strait and then south toward the South
China Sea. Its route home took it north of the Taiwan Strait, thus
essentially completing a circumnavigation of the island. The Liaoning
has already transited the Strait twice in 2018, skirting the median line
on its first trip. In December 2017, in its annual National Defense
Report, Taiwan's Defense Ministry reported that Chinese military
aircraft had circled the island 15 times over the previous year. They
have continued to do so in 2018. Finally, the pressure campaign includes
what some in Taiwan describe as a "soft" approach. In February, China's
Taiwan Affairs Office published the "31 measures," promulgated with the
aim of "sharing with our Taiwan compatriots development opportunities in
the mainland, and to gradually provide equal treatment for university
studies, entrepreneurship, employment, and improved living standards for
our Taiwanese compatriots on the mainland." Put simply, these are
incentives meant to attract businesses and people from Taiwan to invest,
study, work, and make lives in the People's Republic. If fully
implemented, the measures could benefit the individuals who choose to
take advantage of them. Beijing's intent, however, is clearly malicious.
As J. Michael Cole put it, "The ultimate aim, which Beijing has made no
secret of, is to break support for Taiwanese independence or the 'status
quo' and to engineer desire for unification under 'one China.'" That
effort seems likely to fail, but the greater threat is that the
incentives will attract top talent from Taiwan to the mainland, thus
accelerating a potential "brain drain" on the island, or as Cole puts
it, "deny Taiwan the brain trust and talent it needs to build and
reinvest itself for the future." [Taiwan's leaders believe the threat is
**acute**]{.underline}. Less than a month after TAO announced the "31
measures," the Tsai Administration unveiled its own "Four Directions and
Eight Strategies." The four directions are to "attract and retain talent
in Taiwan by building a quality education and work environment, maintain
Taiwan's advantages in global supply chains, deepen capital markets and
strengthen the cultural audiovisual industry." Among other things, the
eight strategies include "better financial and other support for
academics and researchers, funding of innovators, helping businesses to
reward talented employees, and improve \[sic\] the working conditions
and pay for medical staff." Even if the "31 measures" do not ultimately
succeed in winning hearts and minds or attracting large numbers of
Taiwan's best and brightest to the mainland, Beijing will have succeeded
in forcing Taipei to dedicate limited resources (for example, U.S. \$3.4
billion for an innovation fund) to countering China's effort. Explaining
the Pressure Campaign What does Xi Jinping hope to achieve with his
pressure campaign? Ideally, he would like to see Tsai Ing-wen (not to
mention the population at large) relent, accept the '92 consensus, and
embrace unification. Xi presumably knows, however, that storks do not
play the piano. Even if Tsai was susceptible to such pressure, the
trends on identity and views toward independence versus unification
noted above have proven themselves largely unaffected by changes in
cross-Strait relations. [Xi's efforts to isolate Taiwan
internationally]{.underline} and to gain global acceptance of China's
preferred "One China" narrative [are intended to **reduce** the
potential for **foreign interference** in Beijing's plans for the
island]{.underline}. [The fewer governments that maintain diplomatic
ties with Taiwan]{.underline}, the less foreign appreciation there is
for Taiwan's democracy, the less recognition of the objective reality of
Taiwan's independent statehood, and the more that others adopt the view
that cross-Strait ties are an internal Chinese affair, [the less
foreigners will care about or aid the people of Taiwan in the face of
**Chinese**]{.underline} assertiveness or **[aggression]{.underline}**.
Efforts to isolate Taiwan along with the mainland's mounting military
pressure on the island likewise are meant to convince Taiwan's people
that, ultimately, resistance is futile. Beijing's message to Taipei has
been clear: Whether from the sea or from the air, we can threaten you
from all approaches. In the past, the Western Pacific had, in effect,
provided strategic depth for Taiwan's navy; in operating more frequently
off Taiwan's east coast, China seeks to end that advantage. [Chinese
exercises around the island have the additional benefit of putting added
strain on Taiwan's]{.underline} aging, **[shrinking fighter
inventory]{.underline}**. While it wears down Taiwan's military, [China
hopes to normalize the presence of its own forces]{.underline} on the
waters and in the skies around Taiwan. [Establishing such a new normal
could make strategic]{.underline} and operational [surprise easier for
Beijing should it ever decide to use force]{.underline}. Finally,
Beijing hopes to turn Taiwan's population against Tsai Ing-wen and the
DPP. The latest example of efforts to do so came in the wake of China's
imposition of new flight routes over the Taiwan Strait. China Eastern
Airlines and Xiamen Airlines scheduled and sold tickets for 176
round-trip flights between China and Taiwan that would use the new,
disputed air routes. Taiwan refused approval for the flights given its
ongoing objection to the new flight paths and, as a result, the two
airlines canceled all 176 flights, affecting hundreds of Republic of
China citizens living on the mainland who had planned trips home for the
Lunar New Year. China, of course, blamed Taiwan for their inconvenience.
The use of economic leverage noted above is likewise intended to turn
voters against the DPP. The CCP surely hopes that Taiwan voters,
considering narrowly defined self-interest, will return the KMT to power
in 2020. The Coming Crisis A KMT government would likely accept the '92
consensus as the basis upon which cross-Strait relations can proceed,
but unification will remain out of reach. Beijing may recall the public
blowback to Ma Ying-jeou's 2011 campaign suggestion that talks on a
peace treaty were within reach. A KMT government might be amenable to
closer cross-Strait ties, but then again, given the events of Ma's
second term and the societal trends noted earlier, it might not be. As
Ellen Bork has noted, even Ma, while running for Taipei Mayor in 1998,
described himself in the Taiwanese language as a "new Taiwanese" rather
than a mainlander. During his first presidential campaign, Ma ruled out
unification during his tenure as President, promising not to undermine
the country's sovereignty, which, he said, was for the citizens of the
island to decide. In other words, the KMT is constrained by the changing
popular views on identity and unification that are so troubling to
Beijing. There is little reason to believe those trends can be reversed
or that Taiwan's people will begin to consider unification more
favorably despite the CCP's continued repressive rule. Indeed, over
time, it seems more likely that the KMT will move closer to the DPP on
the issue of cross-Strait ties rather than the reverse. Put simply,
[un-coerced unification is **not in the cards**]{.underline}. As a
result, barring a fundamental Chinese rethink on Taiwan---and there is
no evidence to suggest one might be in the offing---[Beijing is likely
to rely ever **more** on **coercive measures** in its dealings with
Taipei]{.underline}. In 2013, Xi Jinping told Taiwan's delegate to the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, former Vice President Vincent
Siew Wan-chang, that unification should not be delayed: "The issue of
the political divide that exists between the two sides must step by step
reach a final resolution, and it cannot be passed on from generation to
generation." These comments were perhaps the first indicator that Xi
wants unification on his watch, or at least significant progress toward
it. His one-on-one meeting with Ma Ying-jeou in 2015, his work report to
the 19th Party Congress, and the pressure campaign all likewise suggest
that Taiwan is a priority for Xi. [Beijing is not eager to use
force]{.underline}, [but the temptation will **only grow** as Taiwan
remains unbending in defense of its de facto independence and as China
continues to carry out its pressure campaign]{.underline} [without
incurring substantive costs]{.underline}. [Under such
circumstances]{.underline}, accidents and
**[miscalculations]{.underline}** [become **more likely**]{.underline},
with the potential for dangerous follow-on effects. Xi may not want to
pass on the question of unification to the next generation of Chinese
leadership, but it is the freedom of future generations that Taiwan's
leaders believe they must defend now. If there is a middle ground here,
it is exceedingly hard to discern. Taiwan's Options
[Taiwan]{.underline}'s challenges are significant, but not
insurmountable. Put simply, it [must **counter** Chinese efforts to
isolate it]{.underline}; counter Chinese psychological operations
targeted at Taiwan's population; [and enhance its defensive capabilities
and]{.underline}, thus, [its ability to **deter** military
actions]{.underline}. For Taiwan, these three lines of effort should be
mutually reinforcing. Particularly in light of the Vatican's seeming
determination to establish diplomatic ties with Beijing, it is difficult
to see how Taiwan could expand its stable of diplomatic allies, at least
in the near term. Even so, diplomatic relations are not the be-all and
end-all in determining, to use Taiwan's preferred jargon, a nation's
"international space." Nor is inclusion in international organizations,
though certainly Taipei will not give up on participating in ICAO, the
WHO, and others that matter to Taiwan's interests. Taiwan is deeply
enmeshed in the global economy as a major trading economy and an
occupant of a key position in global supply chains, notably in the
high-tech space. A further embrace of free market principles could make
the island into a major site for global business. Were that to proceed,
countries like Germany, France, and Canada might not maintain diplomatic
ties with Taipei, but they would prioritize the island's security and
stability in the Strait if the likes of Siemens, BNP Paribas, and
Manulife were deeply invested in Taiwan. It is for this reason, in part,
that Taiwan's New Southbound Policy, which seeks to develop economic and
cultural ties to countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
Australasia, is so important. It would lessen Taiwan's economic reliance
on the mainland, while enhancing its own value in the eyes of many
countries where China exercises significant influence. Taiwan can also
think creatively about engaging in international forums. Its hosting of
the first-ever Ketagalan Forum in August 2017 and Yushan Forum in
October 2017 is a step in this direction. As Taiwan's answer to the
Shangri-La Dialogue, the dual forums focused, respectively, on
Asia-Pacific security issues and on connectivity with the countries
included in the New Southbound Policy. Former Vice President Dick Cheney
delivered an address at the former. Several former senior government
officials from regional countries---including former Vice Presidents and
Foreign Ministers---attended the Yushan Forum, along with prominent
scholars. Tsai Ing-wen addressed both conferences and met with
participants, which in the latter case included a current U.S.
government official. The high-level participation is promising for
future iterations of the forums and for Taiwan's engagement with the
broader region. Taipei could also consider how it can better use the
international organizations in which it does have membership to expand
its international space. For example, with U.S. support or perhaps with
the United States in the lead, Taiwan might establish one or more
issue-specific "caucuses" within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
grouping to coordinate approaches at annual meetings. Doing so would
allow Taiwan to engage more deeply with a number of countries in a
relatively non-provocative way. Broadly speaking, [Taiwan should also
continue to **deepen** its unofficial relations]{.underline} wherever
possible. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will remain
Taiwan's **most important** foreign partner]{.underline}, but countries
like Japan, Australia, and India may be willing to expand their dealings
with Taipei as Beijing increasingly infringes on their own interests.
**[Quiet cooperation]{.underline}** on issues such as cyber security,
disaster relief, and democracy promotion [is particularly
**promising**]{.underline}. Expanding Taipei's international space in
these ways can reverse the island's increasing isolation and counter the
perception, which China seeks to promote among the island's population,
that Taiwan stands alone in the world. The Tsai government must also
counter the Chinese narrative that problems in cross-Strait ties are due
to her intransigence. On the one hand, this requires a relatively
straightforward public relations effort. The challenge, however, is not
simply one of effective government communications. Over the past decade,
China's influence on Taiwan's media expanded in troubling ways,
according to Chien-Jung Hsu, a researcher at Australia's Monash
University: First, the PRC uses economic affiliation as a means to coopt
some Taiwanese media. It attempts to manage the ownership, editorial
content, coverage, and criticism of China in various media by enabling
pro-Beijing tycoons to acquire media on the island. . . . Second, as the
political orientation of business leaders generally pivots on their
businesses, the PRC puts pressure on those Taiwan media owners who have
invested or intend to invest in China. Thus, those media outlets will
tend to side with China or self-censor on any issue related to China. .
. . Third, the Chinese authorities publish various types of advertorials
disguised as news coverage in Taiwanese media. This placement tactic
facilitates political influence by providing a source of advertising
revenue, often thereby making Taiwan's media into virtual propaganda
agents of the Chinese authorities. . . . Above all, increasing and
closer cross-Strait economic ties have put China in a dominant position
with respect to some Taiwan media. These challenges are difficult to
tackle without impinging on freedom of the press or free markets. One
option would be for Taiwan's government to establish an independent
media watchdog commission, with half of the members coming from the DPP
and half from the KMT. The commission would report on foreign business
ties and overseas investments of media conglomerates and their owners,
while also tracking and identifying advertorials (essentially,
advertisements presented as news coverage). Taiwanese law already
outlaws such advertorials; the Act Governing Relations between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the People of the Mainland Area bans
advertisements from China without prior approval. But enforcement is
difficult. More effective enforcement and steeper fines may be necessary
to curtail the practice. Taiwan's Legislative Yuan should also consider
imposing a reporting requirement on the Mainland Affairs Council. Each
year, in classified and unclassified formats, the MAC should issue a
report describing in depth the CCP's united front work, or influence
operations, in Taiwan. Sunlight is an important means for neutering such
efforts. Of course, [to reassure the population that Taiwan's fate is
not at the mercy of the C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist
[P]{.underline}arty, [Taipei must field a military capable of
**deterring aggression** and]{.underline} of successfully [defending the
island in the event of a conflict]{.underline}. Although Taiwan's armed
forces are well trained, [deterring and defending against Chinese
adventurism is becoming]{.underline} increasingly
**[difficult]{.underline}** [as China's]{.underline} own [military
capabilities advance]{.underline}. Historically a well-equipped force,
[Taiwan has found it]{.underline} increasingly
**[difficult]{.underline}** [to procure modern armaments]{.underline}
for its armed forces. In October 2017, [Tsai]{.underline} Ing-wen
[committed to growing Taiwan's defense budget]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} [2 percent]{.underline} [each year]{.underline}, [and
as much as **3 percent**]{.underline} [should]{.underline} another
country (namely, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates) [sell
**more arms**]{.underline} to the island. She also suggested a special
budget for "significant purchase cases" (read: new fighter jets). New
monies also should be put toward personnel costs associated with the
military's shift to an all-volunteer force and, given the nature of the
threat the PLA poses and the variety of ways the PLA could coerce or use
force against Taiwan, toward fielding a mix of high-end and low-end
capabilities. Among other contingencies, [Taiwan's forces ideally should
have]{.underline} at least [a]{.underline} limited [capacity
to]{.underline} respond rapidly to any infringement of the median line;
defend against cyber attacks; contest a naval or air blockade; control
airspace over the island and deny the PLA air supremacy in the event of
hostilities; withstand a decapitation campaign; prevent amphibious
landings on offshore islands and the main island; conduct a drawn-out
insurgency in the event of an invasion; carry out strike operations on
the mainland; and communicate, coordinate, and [**interoperate** with
the U.S. military]{.underline} and those of other partner nations.
Taiwan cannot focus on countering an invasion to the exclusion of
preparing for other contingencies, as the U.S. Defense Department has at
times appeared to urge Taipei to do. A multi-domain defense effective in
an array of contingencies of varying intensity is the surest means to
deter, and if necessary defeat, Chinese aggression. The U.S. Role In
recent years, [the U.S. government has tended to tie itself in knots
over balancing ties with Taipei and Beijing]{.underline}. Perhaps the
best known example of this predilection concerns Taiwan's request,
during the latter Bush years and the Obama Administration, for new F-16
C/D fighter aircraft. As Defense News reported in 2011, "Taiwan's June
24 petition to submit a letter of request for new F-16 fighter jets was
blocked by the U.S. State Department under orders from the U.S. National
Security Council, sources in Taipei and Washington said." In other
words, the Obama Administration denied Taiwan's request to submit a
request for the aircraft, thus evading having to make any formal
decision on the sale. Problems have continued into the Trump
Administration, as evidenced by the website flag removals described
above. Presumably an initiative arising from the bureaucracy to ensure
compliance with the "one China" policy, the effort was too clever by
half, serving only to further isolate Taiwan and give the appearance of
distance in the Washington-Taipei bilateral relationship. Ironically, it
is a relatively straightforward affair to counter Taiwan's international
isolation within the bounds of the "One China" policy. First, [the
U]{.underline}nited [States]{.underline} [should drop self-imposed
limitations on bilateral engagement]{.underline}. American and Taiwanese
military officers and civilian officials at all levels should be
permitted to meet---in both the United States and Taiwan. The militaries
should exercise together in bilateral and multilateral settings. [When
it comes to **arms sales**]{.underline}, Washington should treat Taiwan
as it does countries with which it has diplomatic ties. [Sales should
occur with **regularity**]{.underline} rather than in bundles, [and they
should not be held hostage to the U.S.-China diplomatic
calendar]{.underline}. To its credit, the Trump Administration has
recently approved American industrial participation in Taiwan's
submarine program; it should next convey a willingness to sell Taiwan
the platforms it requires to ensure a favorable air balance in the
Strait. For too long, Washington has been hesitant to sell Taipei the
defensive articles Taipei assesses it needs most. It would be
particularly valuable for the Trump Administration to publicly affirm at
a senior level that it is U.S. policy, as described in the Taiwan
Relations Act: to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan
by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a
threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of
grave concern to the United States; to provide Taiwan with arms of a
defensive character; and to maintain the capacity of the United States
to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would
jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people
on Taiwan. [The Administration should]{.underline} likewise [affirm that
it is **committed** to]{.underline}, per the TRA, [making]{.underline}
"[available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such
quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability]{.underline}."

[Foreign Affairs published several letters criticizing the Gilley and
Glaser articles, especially the two authors' sanguine view of China's
military deployments]{.underline}. Both authors published rejoinders to
their critics in which they made critical concessions. In Gilley's
words, "If China were to reduce its threat to Taiwan by promising
verifiable and immediate force reductions, as well as by allowing Taipei
to continually expand its role in international organizations, Taiwan
may decide that participating in U.S. military planning, purchasing
major weapons systems from the United States, and denying offshore naval
security to China are no longer worth it. However, [an implicit U.S.
promise to intervene in the event of any invasion of Taiwan would be
necessary in order for Taipei to choose to change course]{.underline}"
(emphasis added).\[19\] Glaser made a similar concession, writing, "[The
United States could stop selling arms to Taiwan but maintain its pledge
to defend Taiwan should China launch an unprovoked attack]{.underline};
it could continue to sell Taiwan arms but make clear that it will not
intervene on Taiwan's behalf should a conflict occur, even if Taiwan did
not provoke it; or it could link its continued support to the Taiwanese
government's willingness to refrain from moving toward
independence."\[20\] Both authors, in other words, admitted that [some
kind of US security guarantee was necessary for Taiwan: in exchange for
ending arms sales, the United States would need to make an
implicit]{.underline} (or explicit) "[promise to
intervene]{.underline}." **[Three serious problems with this line of
argument exist]{.underline}**. First, in the absence of arms sales, **[a
promise to intervene might not be credible]{.underline}**. [Could the
United States mount a successful defense of Taiwan if the island had
been disarmed?]{.underline} **[Second, such a policy invites envelope
pushing on both sides of the strait]{.underline}**. America's
decades-old policy of strategic ambiguity is based on the idea that
keeping the two sides guessing about how the United States will react in
a crisis restrains Taiwan's tendency toward recklessness and Beijing's
tendency toward aggression. Gilley and Glaser are recommending the
United States ditch that policy. Finally, **[trading arms sales for a
promise of intervention would completely undermine the thrust of Gilley
and Glaser's original articles]{.underline}**. On what basis can we
conclude that such a policy would be any less offensive to China than
America's current policy? Indeed, [Beijing would probably find the
promise of direct military intervention even more of an intrusion into
China's domestic affairs than arms sales]{.underline}. And surely
**[such a change in US policy would only accelerate]{.underline}** the
development Freeman is most concerned about, **[an expensive and
destabilizing race for military dominance between the United States and
the PRC]{.underline}**.

**Xiangwei 18** (Wang Xiangwei -- Former Editor-in-Chief for the South
China Morning Post. Columnist and editor for multiple news
organizations. \<MKIM\> "TRUMP'S TRADE WAR WITH CHINA IS JUST HIS
OPENING GAMBIT". 4/14/18. DOA: 10/8/18.
https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/2141399/trumps-trade-war-china-just-his-opening-gambit)

Could the US-China trade war be over before it even starts? The oxymoron
may have a ring of truth to it if the latest remarks from the presidents
of China and the United States are to be taken seriously. In a speech
billed in official media as a major policy announcement, broadcast live
on national television and over the internet, Xi Jinping promised on
Tuesday to widen foreign investors' access to China's financial and
manufacturing sectors, lower trade tariffs, greatly expand imports, and
strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights. Throughout
his speech of nearly 40 minutes, Xi did not mention China's trade spats
with the US or US President Donald Trump. But Xi appeared to have
singled out some pledges to address Trump's concerns. **[A nasty
US-China fight is inevitable]{.underline}**. But it needn't be terminal
In particular, he said China would relax the foreign ownership limit on
automobile joint ventures (currently set at 50 per cent) as soon as
possible and would "significantly lower" tariffs on imported vehicles.
Xi's pledge came less than a day after Trump complained in a tweet that
China imposes a 25 per cent tariff on imported American cars, 10 times
the tariff the US imposes on imported Chinese ones. "Does that sound
like free or fair trade," Trump asked. "No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE
-- going on for years!" Following Xi's speech, Trump reacted favourably.
He tweeted he was thankful of Xi's promises on tariffs and automobile
barriers as well as "his enlightenment on intellectual property and
technology transfers". "We will make great progress together!" he said.
In a briefing, the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders
said the White House was encouraged by Xi's words but it wanted to see
concrete actions from China. She said it intended to keep moving forward
with its plans to impose tariffs. Stock markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai,
and New York rose strongly on Xi's comments, but many overseas media
**[reports concluded that Xi's speech contained no big concessions to
Trump, thus failing to assuage fears of a trade war]{.underline}**.
Those overseas media reports may have misread the intention of Xi's
speech, which is more about portraying China as a responsible world
leader that embraces multilateralism and globalisation against Trump's
unilateralism in terms of his America First policies and threatened
trade wars. By Chinese protocol, top leaders including Xi usually follow
the routine of giving broad outlines and visions at a forum like Boao,
avoiding specific targets. Moreover, directly and fully addressing
Trump's concerns in the speech would have been seen as a total
capitulation by China, which is out of the question in the current
heated climate. It is worth noting that Xi stressed he would see the
measures outlined in his speech were released and executed as soon as
possible. This may be China's subtle message to US officials to restart
their discussions over trade frictions and ease any suspicions they may
have that Xi's speech was just more shadow boxing by China -- great
rhetoric but no action. In 2017, Xi gave a rousing speech in Davos about
China leading the world as a champion of globalisation but foreign
investors have complained there has been little meaningful progress
since. Both US and Chinese officials have confirmed that their
discussions over trade frictions have stalled amid the continuing war of
words in traditional and social media. One year on, it is time China
delivered on Xi's Davos speech Now with the positive response from Trump
and the White House, both sides are expected to resume talks very soon.
But **[even if both sides reach comprehensive agreements to avoid a
trade war]{.underline}** in the next few months, **[that will not be the
end of the downward spiral in their relationship]{.underline}**. Now it
has become increasingly clear that **[America's real beef with China is
about much more than fixing a trade imbalance -- even though that issue
may be the trigger]{.underline}**. **[Trump]{.underline}**, or at least
some of his senior Sinophobic advisers, **[appears to have a much more
sweeping agenda aimed at curbing China's technological
advances]{.underline}** and thus containing China's overall economic
rise. Peter Navarro, **[Trump's trade adviser]{.underline}**, said as
much in his op-ed piece in the Financial Times on Monday. The timing was
deliberate as it came one day before Xi's speech. Referring directly to
the country's Made In China 2025 policy manifesto, he **[said if China
dominates strategic hi-tech industries]{.underline}** including
artificial intelligence, robotics and quantum computing, self-driving
vehicles, automated machine tooling, and advanced medical devices,
"**[the US simply will not have an economic future]{.underline}**". Why
China's silence on Xi's term limits move portends trouble One less
talked but equally important reason is that the trade agenda is also
driven by the **[ideological hawks in the White House]{.underline}** who
**[are disappointed that]{.underline}** nearly 20 years after
**[China]{.underline}** joined the WTO, it **[has not turned out as
democratic as the West had hoped]{.underline}**. In fact, following the
decision to repeal the term limits on the presidency, allowing Xi to
rule indefinitely, **[many see China as going backwards. All this shows
that the trade war is most likely to be the opening gambit of a series
of moves by Washington to throw China off balance. The next]{.underline}
likely [move will be on Taiwan]{.underline}**, one of the most sensitive
issues in China-US ties. **[Beijing]{.underline}** sees the island as
part of China and **[frowns on any official contact between Taiwan
and]{.underline}** other foreign countries, particularly **[the United
States]{.underline}**. **[Soon after Trump was elected, he started to
play the Taiwan card]{.underline}** **[by taking a congratulatory phone
call from the Taiwanese president]{.underline}** Tsai Ing-wen in his
transition to the White House and made no secret of his wish to use the
Taiwan issue to force trade concessions from China. **[Since then, his
administration has made several moves to warm ties with
Taiwan]{.underline}**, including approving the licences for American
firms to sell Taiwan technology to build submarines and signing the
Taiwan Travel Act to encourage visits between American and Taiwan
officials. **[Another notable example is the recent appointment of John
Bolton]{.underline}** **[as the National Security
Adviser]{.underline}**. **[Bolton is known for taking a very strong
pro-Taiwan stance]{.underline}** in the past and there is growing
speculation he may visit Taipei in June when the new American Institute,
the de facto US embassy, is slated to open. **[If Bolton or some other
senior US official makes the trip, China will see that as a major
provocation.]{.underline}** **[In a related move, the US is likely to
put more pressure on China over the South China Sea following
reports]{.underline}** last week **[that China had installed
communications-jamming equipment]{.underline}** there to assert its
authority. In January, Bolton wrote an op-ed piece suggesting that US
could accord Taiwan full diplomatic status if China did not back off in
the South China Sea. **[The US is also more likely to send more warships
to the disputed waters]{.underline}** in the name of freedom of
navigation. **[This context helps to explain the unusually strong
rhetoric from Chinese officials]{.underline}** and media **[over Trump's
decision to impose tariffs worth US\$150 billion on Chinese
imports]{.underline}**. Over the past week, **[the Chinese state media
has launched an intense campaign to blast Trump and his tariff decision,
saying that the Chinese will not be cowered and will
retaliate]{.underline} in kind [without hesitation]{.underline}**. But
some of the nationalistic language has become worrisome. Lining up
officials and economists to condemn Trump's unilateral approaches and
mounting a robust defence of **[China's positions is]{.underline}** one
thing. But comparing the **[preparation]{.underline}s [for a trade war
to]{.underline} those for [a real war]{.underline}** to fan the
nationalistic sentiment is unhelpful. In one of a series of combative
commentaries, **[the Global Times]{.underline}** -- the hawkish
newspaper owned by People's Daily -- **[urged China to fight the trade
war with the spirit in which it fought American soldiers in the Korean
war]{.underline}**. Xinhua went further by dusting off a phrase China
used as a final warning to India and Vietnam right before launching
military attacks on them in 1962 and in 1978 respectively. All **[this
war language may send a strong unified message to the US]{.underline}**
but it oversimplifies the evolving and complex bilateral ties between
the world's two largest economies. Following Xi's speech, official media
were at pains to explain Xi's promises of more economic liberalisation
did not stem from mounting pressure from the US and China was not
capitulating. People's Daily said in a blog that while those measures
would benefit many of China's trade partners, they were "not applicable
to those countries which violate WTO rules, and readily launch trade
wars against other countries". As China beats its war drum, who should
hear its call? Perhaps such language stems from the historical
perspective that China's opening up was often forced upon it by external
forces. But 40 years ago, Deng Xiaoping showed great foresight and
wisdom by putting China on the path of reform and opening up. As Xi
acknowledged in his speech, Deng's policies have brought revolutionary
changes to China, helping pave the way for it to become the world's
second largest economy and the biggest trading nation. The measures
unveiled in Xi's speech are equally significant and necessary to bring
the country's economy to a new level. It is in China's own best
interests to see them implemented as soon as possible. All the better if
implementation of those measures helps repair ties with the US.

### Uniq: Deter Up/Sales Key

[The Trump administration's plan to sell **tanks**]{.underline},
**[missiles]{.underline}** [and ground-launched **air
defenses**]{.underline} [to Taiwan embodies]{.underline} what might be
called [a strategic **paradigm shift**]{.underline} [to empower the
small island's **deterrence posture**]{.underline} [against]{.underline}
an often-threatened [Chinese invasion]{.underline}. While much existing
discussion centers upon strengthening Taiwanese air, sea and undersea
defenses, [there]{.underline} also [appears to be an unequivocal need
for major land defenses]{.underline}. The existing air-sea emphasis is
extremely important, yet there are certainly elements of this approach
which invite further discussion about the need to provide Taiwan with a
strong, armored ground force as well. The proposed \$2 billion arms
package includes 108 main battle tanks, 250 Stinger anti-air missiles,
as well as 409 Javelins and 1,240 TOW anti-tank missiles. [Drawing
heavily upon a US Pacific presence along with Asian-theater allied
support]{.underline}, [a maritime-air Taiwan defense strategy has
clearly had a **deterrence impact** in recent years]{.underline}. [Part
of this]{.underline} ability to keep a Chinese invasion at bay
[has]{.underline} naturally [hinged upon a **strong US posture**
ensuring defense of the island]{.underline}. [A cursory look at US arms
sales]{.underline} [to Taiwan]{.underline} in recent decades [reveals a
maritime strategic emphasis]{.underline}: the US has sold frigates,
amphibious ships, harpoons and key air assets such as Chinook and
Blackhawk helicopters. [While these initiatives are]{.underline}, quite
obviously, [not useless]{.underline} \-- [there have been some
significant factors that have emerged in recent years
which]{.underline}, without question, [change the deterrence
landscape]{.underline}. Taiwan received some Patriot
([PAC-3]{.underline}) air defense missiles during the George W. Bush
administration, yet Taiwan has overwhelmingly purchased maritime
defenses. They have also received air-to-ground and air-to-air weapons,
torpedos, and ship-fired SM-2 missiles. Simply put,
[China's]{.underline} accelerated **[naval modernization]{.underline}**
**[plan]{.underline}** [continues to alarm many at the
Pentagon]{.underline}. [The Chinese are]{.underline} not only on a fast
track to build indigenous aircraft carriers but also [**moving quickly**
on new submarines]{.underline}, [amphibs]{.underline},
[destroyers]{.underline}, [corvettes and other maritime
assets]{.underline}, leading many to assess that the Chinese Navy may in
fact be passing the US Navy in sheer size. In effect, [this means that
any kind of Chinese sea-air focused attack could meet with
**success**]{.underline} at great cost to the pro-US nations in the
area. Several Congressional US-China Economic and Security Reviews
released in recent years, along with an Office of Naval Intelligence
(ONI) report specify concern about Chinese naval weapons and platform
modernization. The Chinese are known to be working on more YUZHAO LPDs -
amphibious attack vehicles which can carry 800 troops, four helicopters
and up to 20 armored vehicles, according to the Congressional
assessment. China's surface fleet is also bolstered by production of at
least 60 smaller, fast-moving HOUBEI-class guided missile patrol boats
and ongoing deliveries of JIANGDAO light frigates armed with naval guns,
torpedoes and anti-ship cruise missiles. Furthermore, while Chinese
attack submarine expansion is widely known, an often less-recognized
fact is the rapid development of heavily-armed LUYANG III destroyers,
equipped with anti-submarine weapons and new, vertically-launched
anti-ship cruise missiles. ONI also raised concerns about China's
nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine force, to include the
Jin-class submarines \-- bringing China\'s "first credible
at-sea-second-strike nuclear capability,\" the ONI report states. The
submarine would fire the JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile,
which has a range of 4,000 nautical miles and would \"enable the Jin to
strike Hawaii, Alaska and possibly western portions of CONUS
\[continental United States\] from East Asian waters,\" ONI assessed.
Given this circumstance, [it is]{.underline} quite [reasonable to
observe that]{.underline}, [in the event of]{.underline} some kind
[Chinese attack]{.underline}, [Taiwanese and allied maritime power alone
may not be sufficient]{.underline}. [Accordingly]{.underline}, [a
credible ground force]{.underline} fortified by tanks and air-defense
missiles [does two clear things]{.underline}: [it could]{.underline}
very well further **[deter]{.underline}** [China by virtue of ensuring a
high-casualty ground war and]{.underline} also [force China to transit
heavy forces across the ocean]{.underline}. That kind of heavy
deployment is never easy, and certainly not without major risk of air
and sea attack. [Both of these factors seem]{.underline}, without
question, [to further **strengthen** Taiwan's **deterrence
strategy**]{.underline}. Even if China believes it would ultimately
prevail in a ground invasion against Taiwan, the promise of a credible
Taiwanese ground threat does change the equation. [This could also
**decrease** the possibility of any needed US intervention]{.underline}.
In particular, Javelin anti-tank missiles, TOW missiles and Stinger
anti-aircraft weapons would certainly enable a Taiwanese defense force
to target Chinese tanks, helicopters, armored vehicles and even drones.
Looking back over the past decade, this history underscores the fact
that the current Trump administration posture, as evidenced by the
proposed sale, signifies what could be called an ambitious new step in
US Pacific strategy.

The ever-tense political and security environment across the Taiwan
Strait necessitates an accurate depiction of PLA capabilities,
strengths, and shortfalls. ¶ Various sources from within the People\'s
Republic of [China have allegedly suggested that **time is running out
for Taiwan\'s democracy**. In their narrative, China\'s iron-fisted
leader, Xi Jinping, is \"losing patience\" and could order the invasion
of Taiwan in the early 2020s.]{.underline} The world\'s most dangerous
flashpoint might witness an overwhelming amphibious blitz, perhaps
before July 2021 to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP). ¶ That\'s the narrative[. The reality is
that China will probably not attack Taiwan in such a radical and
high-risk fashion]{.underline}. Xi and his top lieutenants are far more
likely to draw-out and escalate the war of nerves across the Taiwan
Strait. They will continue using disinformation and other techniques to
drain Washington\'s confidence that Taiwan can be defended, while
ramping up subversive activities to undermine the island nation\'s
confidence and willpower. ¶ [Xi will bide his time]{.underline} and hope
the Taiwanese government cracks under mounting pressure, allowing him to
conquer his target cheaply. At the same time, his military generals will
continue planning and preparing to deliver on their \"sacred\" mission.
Coercion could easily fail, making invasion a tempting option―especially
in a future scenario where the balance of power looks more favorable to
Beijing than it does today. ¶ Assessing the Threat: ¶ [The ever-tense
political and security environment across the Taiwan Strait necessitates
an accurate depiction of PLA capabilities, strengths, and
shortfalls]{.underline}. ¶ The PLA\'s strengths are more apparent than
its weaknesses. China\'s military muscle is frequently highlighted and
hyped up by the media, both in Beijing and abroad. Undoubtedly, China\'s
ballistic missiles, cyber warfare capabilities, and counter-space
weapons make it a force to be reckoned with. Perhaps even more dangerous
are its espionage and covert actions abroad to shape foreign
policymaking. ¶ But there is always more to the story. Renowned Naval
War College professor, Andrew Erickson, makes it clear in his recently
published book, Chinese Naval Shipbuilding that while Beijing\'s fleets
are growing at a remarkable clip, [the **PLA Navy** is **not ready to
support** the **invasion of Taiwan**. The Chinese navy still lacks the
lift capacity and the air defense capability it needs.]{.underline}
Nonetheless, the situation will almost certainly look very different
tomorrow than it does today. ¶ Dennis Blasko, author of The Chinese Army
Today, observes that the CCP\'s ground forces, like the navy, are not
yet ready for the ultimate fight. For invasion to be a realistic option,
China would have to have far more helicopters, paratroopers, special
operators, amphibious mechanized divisions, and marines. Moreover, the
PLA would need to build a solid non-commissioned officer corps and
provide better training to unit leaders up and down the entire chain of
command. Much of this work has already begun and will start to bear
fruit over the next decade. ¶ Taiwan\'s Anti-Invasion Strategy: ¶ So how
do Taiwanese military experts plan to defend their country against
attack, and how can the United States help? ¶ Taiwan is at the tail end
of a transit from a conscription force to an all-volunteer military.
Building an elite force of professional warriors is a good thing. It
gives Taiwan a comparative advantage. China has no national army and
relies mostly on short-term draftees. ¶ According to a recent RAND
Corporation report, [Taiwan could augment its all-volunteer military
with elite reserve force units, further enhancing its ability to counter
Chinese threats in the electromagnetic, air, and sea domains. Taiwan\'s
armed forces could also benefit from new training opportunities.
Bilateral training exercises and joint humanitarian missions with the
U.S. military would give Taiwan a much-needed shot in the
arm]{.underline}. ¶ Modern wars are increasingly decided not by brute
force, but by brainpower. This can only be harnessed with advanced
training. One of Taiwan\'s primary defense goals is to prepare the
island for the shock of a lightning war waged by the Peoples Liberation
Army (PLA). Doing so requires highly-motivated personnel who are
organized, trained, and equipped to meet an enemy invasion campaign with
overwhelming resistance. ¶ [The asymmetry of size and economy across the
Taiwan Strait requires defense planners on the island to harness every
aspect of power, bringing a wide range of latent capabilities to bear
when needed.]{.underline} Taiwan\'s all-out defense strategy calls for
mobilizing the entire country, gearing-up every able-bodied man and
woman in support of anti-invasion operations. ¶ As Lauren Dickey of
Kings College London points out, Taiwan\'s Ministry of National Defense
(MND) is constantly honing its ability to repulse Chinese invasion.
Every year, MND conducts intensive national and local-level military
exercises, testing and sharpening plans to defend the island in the
event of enemy landings. ¶ It is estimated that [Taiwan will have
approximately four weeks advanced warning of a Chinese invasion. Given
China\'s skill in the dark arts of strategic deception, this cannot be
taken for grante]{.underline}d. Yet the vast scale of the PLA\'s
envisioned amphibious operations necessarily means its offensive
intentions would be foreshadowed. ¶ Warning signs would include troop
movements, reserve mobilization, industrial stockpiling, military
drills, media signaling, diplomatic messaging, and sabotage against
Taiwan. [The most obvious and worrisome sign would be the gathering of
massive fleets of civilian and naval vessels at known amphibious staging
areas in southeast China]{.underline}. ¶ As all this was playing out,
Taiwan\'s president, her cabinet advisors, and parliamentary leaders
would debate their response options. They would weigh intelligence
pouring in from radars, satellites, listening posts, and agents in
China. Their most obvious option would be to increase readiness levels
and mobilize the island to gun-down an enemy attack. ¶ It would not take
long to mine the maritime lines of approach across the Taiwan Strait,
nor to fortify invasion beaches, ports, and airstrips. It would take
only slightly longer to man all inland key points like bridges and power
stations, and to evacuate non-essential personnel from potential battle
zones. But accomplishing this would require a colossal workforce in the
form of mobilized army reservists and contractors. For this reason,
[Taiwan maintains the ability to mobilize up to two and a half million
men and nearly one million civil defense workers in just a few days
time]{.underline}. ¶ Tests of the emergency mobilization system are
carried out on a yearly basis at sites across Taiwan, Penghu, and the
outer islands (Kimen and Matsu). Their results are impressive. They
indicate that citizen-soldiers will muster at marshalling posts in
extraordinary numbers and at rapid speeds. ¶ Taiwan's all-out defense
mobilization plan entails more than just bringing latent military
capabilities into action. The Cabinet Office (Executive Yuan) and its
subordinate ministries such as the Ministry of Transportation, Ministry
of the Interior, and Ministry of Economic Affairs (among others) all
play a role in the integration of civil defense units for homeland
defense. ¶ The Way Forward: ¶ Taiwan\'s government and military (like
the rest of Taiwanese society) are far tougher than they get credit for.
But they can only do so much by themselves. The Pentagon has a critical
role to play in assisting Taiwan maximize its war fighting capabilities.
With America\'s help, Taiwan can make sure its defense investments
factor into Beijing\'s calculations and, hopefully, prevent a future
invasion from occurring in the first place. ¶ The RAND report suggests
the establishment of a joint working group, led on the U.S. side by an
assistant secretary of defense. Indeed, Taiwanese forces would benefit
from new types of professional military education and technical training
in the United States. American mentors could support Taiwan's continued
transit to a potent all-volunteer force and help create a more
strategically focused reserve force. ¶ [Taiwanese troops also need
regular and dependable arms sales, something that unfortunately was
denied them by the Bush and Obama administrations. For Taiwan, the
**positive operational and tactical effects of American weapons systems
are indisputable**. The Trump administration should offer Taiwan the
same capabilities it is offering Japan and South Korea, including new
stealth fighter jets, missile defense batteries, and
destroyers]{.underline}. ¶ In addition, American companies should be
unchained by Washington, allowing them to compete for access to
Taiwan\'s Indigenous Defense Submarine program. [Even more important
than firepower would be the huge morale boosting effects such material
support would have on recruitment and retention on the island―and the
**powerful signal of purpose and resolve it would send to
China**.]{.underline}

[Abandoning Taiwan might]{.underline} considerably
**[enhance]{.underline}** [China's military and geostrategic position in
Asia]{.underline}, [and severely weaken that of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} its [allies]{.underline}.
[Proponents]{.underline} of abandonment also tend to
**[overlook]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} considerable
**[geostrategic significance]{.underline}** [of Taiwan]{.underline}.
Famously termed "the cork in the bottle" of the South China Sea by
Admiral Ernest King, and dubbed an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" by
General Douglas MacArthur, [Taiwan occupies an enviable position at the
heart of maritime Asia]{.underline}, with the Luzon strait to its south,
the East China Sea to its north, and the Philippine Sea to its East. As
U.S. Naval War College professors James Holmes and Toshi Yoshihara have
documented, Chinese strategists are well aware of Taiwan's rarefied
strategic location, and frequently refer to the island as the "Gibraltar
of the East," and as a future "springboard to the Pacific."
[Authoritative Chinese writings]{.underline} [such as The Science of
Military Strategy]{.underline} [posit that]{.underline} [If Taiwan
should be alienated from the mainland]{.underline}, [China
will]{.underline} forever [be **locked** to the west side of the first
chain of islands in the West Pacifi]{.underline}c,
[and]{.underline}...[the essential strategic space for China's
rejuvenation will be lost]{.underline}. [China]{.underline} clearly,
therefore, [views Taiwan as]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[highly
valuable]{.underline}** [geostrategic asset]{.underline}, [rather
than]{.underline} merely [as]{.underline} [an unresolved territorial
issue]{.underline}---and for good reason. Indeed, [if China were to
occupy Taiwan]{.underline}, [Chinese naval and air forces
could]{.underline} finally [break out of the]{.underline} psychological
and geographic **[barrier]{.underline}** [formed by]{.underline} what
Chinese naval strategists commonly refer to as "[the **first island
chain**]{.underline}." Moreover, China would be able to directly
threaten Japan's southwestern approaches, and potentially sever its air
and sea lines of communication. [After winning control over the
Taiwanese islet of Itu Aba]{.underline} in the South China Sea, which
forms the largest island in the Spratlys, [the PLA would also be in a
position to exert **stronger pressure**]{.underline} [on smaller
littoral states throughout]{.underline} maritime [Southeast
Asia]{.underline}. Chinese [submarines]{.underline} stationed at the
Taiwanese deep-water bases at Hualien and Su Auo [would enjoy unfettered
access to deep Pacific waters]{.underline}, both [expanding their
operational reach and rendering them more difficult to detect and
prosecute]{.underline} [in the event of conflict]{.underline}. U.S.
forces might then find themselves wrestling with a similar challenge to
that faced by the Royal Navy following the fall of France in World War
II. Indeed, in the summer of 1940, German U-boats, which had previously
been primarily confined to the North Sea and English Channel, were
berthed in newly acquired deep-sea ports along the French Atlantic
coastline. From these new bases along the Bay of Biscay, they could
rapidly disperse into the deeper waters of the Atlantic Ocean, enabling
them to pose a far greater threat to allied shipping. [Chinese
occupation of radar sites on Taiwan's mountaintops would also allow the
PLA to monitor and target]{.underline} American and Japanese [naval
deployments with greater ease]{.underline}. More importantly, notes one
observer, "[The Taiwan Strait would become an inland
waterway]{.underline}," [allowing China to interdict the heavy flow of
container traffic that transits through the strait on a daily
basis]{.underline}. Thus, in many ways, a [Chinese occupation of Taiwan
would amount to]{.underline} nothing less than [a **tectonic
shift**]{.underline} [in the geostrategic balance of power in
Asia]{.underline}, much as a successful Ottoman absorption of the isle
of Malta would have transformed the entire equilibrium of forces in the
Mediterranean of the sixteenth century. [A]{.underline}
"[post-Taiwan]{.underline}" [PRC would find its geostrategic position in
Asia **greatly strengthened**]{.underline}, [that of the U.S. and its
allies **considerably weakened**]{.underline}, [and would be at far
greater liberty to coerce its neighbors]{.underline}. Moreover, [history
suggests that]{.underline} [sudden territorial gains]{.underline}
frequently [foster desire amongst nationalistic elites for **further
expansion**]{.underline}, particularly if the state in question harbors
concerns over the security of its extended periphery or over its future
vulnerability to economic disruption. As China's resource penuries and
dependence on seaborne energy imports continue to grow, this is an
important element to keep in consideration. In this light,
[the]{.underline} continued [**lack of resolution** over Taiwan
has]{.underline}, in effect, [been largely **beneficial**]{.underline},
[rather than detrimental]{.underline}, [to American grand strategy in
Asia by **focusing** the PLA's strategic attention]{.underline}, thus
[diverting it from potentially more ambitious undertakings
overseas]{.underline}. [If China **gained control** over
Taiwan]{.underline}, [the nature of its military competition with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would]{.underline} undoubtedly
**[change]{.underline}**, [and take on a more **global
character**]{.underline}. After having spent several decades focusing
primarily on antiaccess and area denial, [the PLA would now be able to
invest]{.underline} more intensely [in air and naval assets better
suited for **power projection**]{.underline}. As Robert D. Kaplan notes:
[If China succeeds in]{.underline}, in effect, [consolidating
Taiwan]{.underline}, not only will its navy be in an advantageous
strategic position vis-à-vis the first island chain, but \[\...\] [its
national energies]{.underline} \[\...\] [will be]{.underline} just as
dramatically [freed up to look outward in terms of power
projection]{.underline}, [to a degree that has so far been
impossible]{.underline}. Proponents of offshore balancing argue that
American grand strategy should return to its core roots, and limit its
ambitions to preventing a peer competitor from gaining control over
Eurasia. Forsaking Taiwan might paradoxically precipitate, rather than
prevent, such an outcome.

China\'s growing might is forcing Taiwan to overhaul its military
strategy TAIWAN \"MUST and will\" be reunited with the mainland,
declared Xi Jinping, China\'s president, on January 2nd. Chinese leaders
have been saying such things since the retreating Nationalists separated
the island from the rest of the country after losing the civil war to
the Communists in 1949. But Mr Xi has done more than just talk: he has
sent bombers and warships to circle the island, held live-fire drills in
the narrow Taiwan Strait and, Taiwanese generals say, instructed the
People\'s Liberation Army (PLA) to be capable of seizing Taiwan by force
by next year. [Back in 1996]{.underline}, [the most recent cross-strait
crisis]{.underline}, [China\'s military spending was barely **twice**
Taiwan\'s]{.underline}. [Now it is **15 times** greater]{.underline}.
[That has left Taiwanese leaders rushing to **rethink** their
defences]{.underline}. [Taiwan already does a great deal to make itself
indigestible to invaders]{.underline}. [The island is]{.underline}
\"**[honeycombed]{.underline}** [with bunkers]{.underline}\", says Ian
Easton of the Project 2049 Institute, an American think-tank. [**Tanks**
are hidden away in bustling neighbourhoods of Taipei]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} Sun Yat-sen Memorial [Highway Number One was
built]{.underline} [to handle]{.underline} not only rush-hour traffic,
but also [ten-tonne fighter jets]{.underline}, since the island\'s
airfields would quickly be destroyed by Chinese missiles should war
break out. [America]{.underline}, Taiwan\'s closest military ally, [has
urged the island to move further towards a]{.underline} \"**[porcupine
strategy]{.underline}**\". [It wants Taiwan to acquire
smaller]{.underline}, [cheaper and more mobile weapons that could wear
down Chinese forces]{.underline} close to Taiwan\'s shores, [in the
place of big]{.underline}, [lumbering and expensive kit]{.underline}
such as warplanes and battleships, [which are better suited to
projecting firepower onto China\'s mainland]{.underline}. [Taiwanese
planners have **taken note**]{.underline}. In 2017 the country\'s top
military officer launched the \"Overall Defence Concept\". That
[strategy]{.underline}, endorsed by Tsai Ing-wen, the president,
[embraces the porcupine ethos]{.underline}. [One priority is
**intelligent sea mines**]{.underline}, which can scoot around and so
evade sweeping. Some are more advanced than anything in America\'s
arsenal. Another focus is unmanned platforms, such as remote-controlled
sentry guns to guard outlying islands and armed drones to patrol the
coastline. Third is an emphasis on missiles. Taiwan is churning out
Hsiung Feng cruise missiles by the hundreds. These can be placed not
only on small, zippy speedboats rather than bulky destroyers, but also
in unmarked lorries. Such rocket-laden vehicles are hidden \"in places
you cannot imagine\", says one official, and could continue to operate
from anywhere on the road network long after invaders had obliterated
Taiwan\'s fighter jets. Better yet, they are far cheaper than warplanes.
Yet not everyone is willing to jettison traditional ways of war. The new
defence policy appeals to the president and her staff not only for its
military virtues, but also because it favours the smaller systems that
Taiwan can build itself. But the top brass has reasons beyond vanity to
defend their shiny objects. They concede that [heavy
**tanks**]{.underline}, [big **ships**]{.underline} [and fancy
**warplanes**]{.underline} may not survive a head-to-head conflict with
China. But they [act as a **deterrent**]{.underline} and boost morale.
Missiles cannot fend off prowling Chinese bombers nor speedboats patrol
stormy oceans. \"Parades are a form of deterrence, certainly in Asia,\"
notes Drew Thompson, who used to help shape policy on Taiwan at
America\'s Department of Defence. \"Big-ticket items parade well.\"
[They also let Taiwan take the fight to China]{.underline}. [Taiwan\'s
American-made frigates would eventually be blown out of the
water]{.underline}, [but not before their potent torpedoes might inflict
**serious damage** on Chinese ships]{.underline}. That would not only
boost the morale of islanders facing a hailstorm of missiles, it might
also induce caution in Mr Xi. The problem is that showcase weapons are
expensive. Even domestically built submarines\--Taiwan hopes to make
eight\--cost more than \$1bn apiece; the entire annual defence budget is
just \$11bn. Money is even tighter because Taiwan is scrapping
conscription and shifting to an all-volunteer force. And since salaried
soldiers are pricier, their numbers are fewer. Taiwan\'s armed forces
have shed more than 150,000 people since China\'s cross-strait
muscle-flexing in 1996, leaving 215,000. The country\'s reserve force,
its second line of defence, will also shrink with every passing year.
Even so, any return to compulsory enlistment would be electoral suicide,
politicians say. **[American arms]{.underline}**, even big, expensive
ones at odds with the porcupine philosophy, [also serve a diplomatic
purpose]{.underline}. [America\'s involvement in a war could be the
difference between Taiwan\'s survival and extinction]{.underline}. [Just
eight American submarines could sink 40% of China\'s amphibious fleet in
the first week of fighting]{.underline}, according to computer
simulations by the RAND Corporation, a think-tank. Although America does
not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, it maintains close ties. Some
3,500-4,000 Pentagon officials travel to Taiwan every year, an average
of more than 100 per day. Arms sales have totalled more than \$15bn
since 2010. The relationship is deepening in some respects. **[Arms
transfers]{.underline}** were previously bundled into big packages that
reliably aroused Chinese anger; they [are now growing **more
routine**]{.underline}. The administration of Donald Trump is stacked
with senior officials who know Taiwan well and sympathise with its
plight. Mr Trump delighted Taiwan\'s leaders by holding a taboo-busting
phone call with Ms Tsai when he was president-elect. Last year he also
signed the Taiwan Travel Act, which encourages senior American officials
to visit the island and vice versa. If [arms sales help **bolster**
America\'s **commitment** to Taiwan]{.underline}, so much the better.
Though Mr Xi clearly feels obliged to continue to hound Taiwan about
reunification, he has thus far avoided laying down a firm timeline. The
relatively slow growth of China\'s amphibious fleet casts doubt on the
idea that the PLA is working flat out to be ready to invade. Nor has it
been conducting big amphibious exercises. There is still time for Taiwan
to sharpen its quills.

#### U.S. arms sales are key to credible deterrence in Taiwan -- it's on the brink.

After a landslide victory, Taiwan's president-elect Tsai Ing-wen and the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) face no shortage of hurdles ahead.
The Taiwanese electorate hopes to see presidential priority given to
boosting a lagging economy and mitigating societal pressures springing
from volatile property prices. The decisions made by the Tsai
administration in managing Taiwan's economy will undoubtedly spill over
into the security realm and management of the island's relationship with
mainland China. While Tsai has said that she intends to safeguard
stability, continue communication with the mainland, and avoid both
provocation and surprises, the specifics of her policy toward the
mainland --- not to mention Beijing's reaction --- remain largely
undetermined. Last week at War on the Rocks, Jennifer Turner outlined
six strategic options the DPP will likely be weighing as it looks to
formulate the defense strategy of a new administration. She cautiously
concludes that [no single strategic paradigm is a panacea to the threat
posed by China]{.underline}, [pressure from the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to do more on defense]{.underline}, an[d downward
domestic pressure on Taiwanese defense spending]{.underline}. Turner is
right. There is no easy, one-size-fits-all remedy amid these competing
interests and challenges. None of Turner's suggested strategies are
mutually exclusive, nor should they be perceived as such. [What stems
from these strategic options is a demand for Taiwan to focus first and
foremost on strengthening indigenous elements of national strength as
the most reliable strategy for a continued **deterrent
posture**]{.underline}. [A stronger Taiwan can only be the product of a
society that believes in the value of **deterrence**]{.underline} and
defense posture, as well as a government that is willing to lead the
electorate in steps necessary to enhance both hard and soft power
capabilities. More importantly, [a stronger Taiwan does not have to come
at the cost of closer ties with mainland China]{.underline}. The good
news: Tsai and her team already have a starting point from which to
begin rethinking and revising the island's defense strategy. Strategic
guidelines and frameworks have been delineated in the Taiwanese Ministry
of National Defense's 2015 National Defense Report and DPP Defense Blue
Papers. These reports offer good reason to believe that Tsai has a
tentative vision for balancing economic reforms with the demands of
Taiwan's active deterrent posture, all while avoiding inciting Chinese
aggression. The question is whether Tsai's defense vision, when taken
out of policy documents and put into practice, will sufficiently account
for the threat environment Taiwan currently faces. Regardless of which
strategic paradigm Tsai ultimately subscribes to, her administration's
defense policy will likely build upon the MND report's identification of
six core security challenges facing Taiwan: the rapid expansion of
mainland China's military strength; maritime rights and sovereignty
claims over disputed islands; defense resource constraints; the military
recruitment challenge of a decreasing proportion of able-bodied
individuals within the Taiwanese population; network attacks; and
challenges to the will to fight (or, what is translated "defense
consciousness"). Of these challenges, the most concerning in the minds
of Taiwanese defense strategists is the expansion of the People's
Liberation Army (PLA). If defense spending statistics are not convincing
enough, the reality of China's diversifying military capabilities was
demonstrated in the PLA's September 2015 parade to commemorate its World
War II victory over Japan, recent announcements of Su-35 purchases, a
second aircraft carrier in development, and ongoing PLA organizational
reforms. [The **threat environment** created by China's military
modernization requires a special sort of policy response from
Taiwan]{.underline}: [Taiwanese defense must grow increasingly
**asymmetric**]{.underline}. [Each and every]{.underline} policy point
and [military capability must have an inherent capacity to
**deter**]{.underline}. [As much as deterrence rests upon
**hardware**]{.underline} with the aims of both denying and punishing an
opponent, Patrick Morgan aptly notes that [deterrence is also a complex
**psychological phenomenon**]{.underline}. [Deterrence allows
decision-makers to **restructure** the set of alternatives available to
their rivals]{.underline}, [a restructuring that aims to **exclude** the
use of force from consideration]{.underline}. For Tsai and her
administration, [the basis for defense decisions]{.underline} and policy
guidelines [should be investments]{.underline} and reforms [that bolster
the island's **deterrence capacities**]{.underline} and alter mainland
China's perception of the Taiwanese military. Investments in enhancing
Taiwan's security that do not come at the cost of the status quo would
naturally foster the continued support of "big brother" Washington, as
Turner noted. Tsai will have to formulate her defense policy in the face
of increased difficulties stemming from the current state of Taiwan's
armed forces. She will not abandon Taiwan's ongoing transition from a
conscript military to an all-volunteer force (AVF). Yet the combination
of slow economic growth and a shrinking labor pool resulting from
Taiwan's low birthrate and public disdain for the Taiwanese military
establishment dissuades many able-bodied youth from service in uniform.
Add to this mix the current antiquated state of much of Taiwan's armed
forces: Even with the boost in platforms and capabilities brought by a
recent U.S. weapons sale, the Taiwanese military establishment is
equipped with aging Dutch-built Zwaardvis submarines, ex-World War
II-era U.S. Navy submarines, and a mixture of indigenous fighter jets,
French Mirage 2000-5s, and U.S. F-5s and F-16s. [To provide **credible**
offensive and defensive capabilities]{.underline}, [the Taiwanese
military will have to embark upon a long-overdue
**modernization**]{.underline}. Additionally, even with the support of
her constituents and majority in the island's parliament, [funding
shortfalls may hinder any updates to defensive capabilities]{.underline}
under Tsai. Taiwan's \$10.7 billion defense budget in 2015 saw a 2.6
percent actual increase from the prior year, but remained short of the
minimum 3 percent mark of total GDP that President Ma Ying-jeou had
promised to maintain. Additional budget strains stem from the transition
to an AVF; personnel costs have increased to around 45 percent of the
defense budget. This has forced a reallocation of funding away from
operations and investments. Even as the Taiwan military downsizes its
active duty force to fewer than 200,000 servicemembers, the budgetary
shifts further reflect the demand of covering higher salaries and
recruitment/retention costs inherent in an AVF. An expansion of
government welfare programs has also left less money for enhanced
national security. Taken in sum, these current trends suggest that the
Taiwanese military will continue to be plagued by shrinking numbers,
rising personnel costs, and a tight budget well into Tsai's first term.
Addressing the need to urgently mend flaws caused by President Ma's
defense policies --- aging capabilities, rising costs, and declining
numbers of personnel --- the defense agenda for the DPP focuses broadly
on three themes: (a) larger investments in Taiwan's defense; (b) better
equipment and training; and (c) a greater peacetime presence. The DPP
envisions combining cyber and electronic warfare capabilities from the
civilian sector with existing military capabilities to form an
information technology corps, or "cyber army," a proposal that
strikingly resembles U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter's "cyber
warriors" plan. Tsai ambitiously plans to decrease reliance on foreign
arms exports through stronger domestic procurement. According to Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research deputy director Kung Ming-hsin, this
shift would generate \$12.17 billion through an inter-linking of defense
industries and 8,000 jobs. What Kung fails to acknowledge, however, is
the likely resulting increase of the relative expense of weapons
procured in Taiwan. Tsai further envisions strengthening missile
defense, developing hardened capabilities that can survive missile
attacks, increasing asymmetric capabilities, preserving strike
capabilities, and establishing a rapid response ground force. Even
achieving these planned security updates for Taiwan in the next four to
eight years of DPP leadership will be a tall order for the Taipei
government and its defense budget. Given such far-reaching demands upon
the island's defense policy, the task ahead for Tsai involves defining
immediate priorities and working within existing defense constraints. An
Action Plan for Tsai's Defense Policy Though the 2015 report issued by
the Ministry of National Defense has set an important foundation, the
change of administration signals an important juncture for the DPP to
re-conceptualize Taiwan's defense policy. [Defense policy]{.underline}
under Tsai [must place renewed emphasis on **credible deterrence**
first]{.underline}, [with securing continued]{.underline} "[big
brother]{.underline}" [support from the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as an ancillary objective]{.underline}. War is in
no one's interest, but **[weakness]{.underline}** [will never placate a
**bullying**]{.underline}, [reunification-driven China]{.underline}.
Taiwan must adopt a defense policy that truly changes Beijing's decision
matrix. While these decisions ultimately rest in the hands of the
Taiwanese people and government, a few proposals merit immediate
consideration by the incoming Tsai administration. Procure, purchase,
and upgrade where realistic. As argued in a 2014 report from the Center
for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Taiwan must "focus on
capabilities that allow it to raise the military costs of aggression
while ... expanding conflict to exact maximum economic and political
costs." Asymmetry should dominate the agenda of Taiwanese strategists as
a necessary building block in both deterrence and defense. Taipei's
persistent focus on costly indigenous submarine development may fast be
rendered inconsequential by developments on the mainland, such as
improved anti-submarine warfare capabilities of the Gaoxin-6 patrol
aircraft and growing numbers of Type 056 Jiangdao-class corvettes.
Instead, Taiwan could consider platforms that would specifically target
weaknesses of existing Chinese capabilities. As a start, these could
include other anti-surface warfare capabilities (such as midget
submarines and stronger ISR capabilities) and anti-submarine
capabilities (such as maritime patrol aircraft and anti-submarine
helicopters). All such efforts would further allow Taiwan to show the
United States that it is serious about its own defense and ready to
support the rebalance. Avoid unrealistic shopping lists. Now that [U.S.
weapons sales to Taiwan]{.underline} appear to [have
resumed]{.underline} after a four-year hiatus, the Tsai administration
may well be back on the market each year looking to buy U.S. platforms.
Long before drawing up a wish list of platforms, officials at the
Ministry of National Defense and the Tsai team should scrutinize how
desired systems integrate with existing Taiwanese capabilities and
training. Possessing a capability and using it properly are two entirely
different things. Equally important, the Taiwanese legislature would be
wise to appropriate the necessary funds for purchasing the requested
quantity of U.S. arms. Sincerity of commitment is requisite from Taiwan
before foreign nations --- the United States or others --- see talks on
arms sales through to completion. Evaluate existing doctrine. Ma's
rapprochement with the mainland damaged the military's core mission of
national defense. As a result, Tsai's defense policy agenda is quite
simple, on the surface: She must realign actions and mission. Since
Taiwan's military power will never match the growing might of mainland
China, the island must reinvigorate an effective defense strategy and
train and equip its armed forces to support that strategy. Defense
policy has focused heavily upon the Taiwanese navy and air force as the
first line of defense, which came at the expense of the readiness of the
Taiwanese army and marine corps. As a retired U.S. Army officer recently
wrote, Taiwan's army is organized conventionally and ill-prepared in its
current state to fight a war of attrition. Meanwhile, the
self-destruction of Taiwan's marine corps creates an equally dangerous
gap in defense doctrine. With only 9,000 personnel --- down from 16,000
just a few years ago --- today's Taiwanese marine corps is "heavy,
mechanized, and not particularly mobile." Additionally, the Taiwanese
navy must continue transitioning from a sea-control to a sea-denial
fleet, a change matching the reality of a Chinese navy that is no longer
a paltry match for the Taiwanese. Finally, the air force must deepen
anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities by continuing to distribute
its fighter fleet across as much of the island as possible. Boost public
opinion of the Taiwanese armed forces. The DPP Defense Blue Papers
acknowledged one of the most important elements of comprehensive
national defense: the mutual support of civil society and the military.
A necessary element of boosting how the Taiwanese think about
servicemembers entails an examination of personnel and manpower
policies. The DPP has outlined, albeit vaguely, an intent to "refine"
Taiwan's veterans affairs policies by boosting support for servicemember
education, offering civil-military dual employable jobs at the Ministry
of National Defense, and integrating veterans hospitals, homes, and care
facilities into an overarching network. But what the DPP has failed to
discuss is how to repair the military's image so that able-bodied
Taiwanese consider the armed forces as suitable career paths. As in the
ongoing debates surrounding the U.S. military, limited career mobility
and few educational or career opportunities dissuade young Taiwanese.
The challenge is to strike a balance between the costs of transitioning
to an AVF --- including higher salaries for servicemembers --- and the
costs of offering better benefits amid other demands on the already
limited defense budget. The Future of Taiwan Depends on Deterrence Tsai
has reassured constituents that, compared with the defense policy under
Ma, her administration will offer a cohesive, unified view of the
requisite steps toward an "obstacle-free environment." [Taipei must
necessarily maintain an ability to **deter and deny** Chinese **access**
to the spaces surrounding Taiwan in addition to the island
itself]{.underline}. [Cross-Strait **crisis stability**]{.underline}
[depends upon **reconstructing** psychological
considerations]{.underline} [in Beijing and eliminating any **perceived

[Taiwan's ability to **strengthen** and bolster credible deterrent
capabilities also depends upon the **support** of the

island's location in the **first island chain**]{.underline}, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has a **strong
interest**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} a [robust Taiwanese
defense]{.underline}. Yet without priority given to building Taiwan's
indigenous defense capabilities, [the island will lack a back-up plan
should Washington's commitment **waver**]{.underline}. It is up to the
new administration to ensure policy, procurement, and planning reflect
the demands of making Taiwan stronger and enhancing powers of both
deterrence and denial while avoiding any moves that would threaten the
political status quo.

PARIS --- [The Trump administration is proposing to sell more than \$2
billion worth of]{.underline} tanks and other [military equipment to
Taiwan]{.underline}, American officials said on Thursday. The sale would
add to tensions between the United States and China, which are already
clashing over trade, communications technology and a military buildup in
the Pacific region. [The sale would be one of the **largest** to Taiwan
in recent years by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. The
single costliest part of the package is 108 M1A2 Abrams tanks, the
officials said, and the deal would also resupply some weapons, including
portable anti-tank missile systems. The United States does not give
national recognition to Taiwan, a de facto independent island off the
southeast coast of China that the Chinese Communist Party intends to
bring back eventually under the control of Beijing, by force if
necessary. But the Taiwan Relations Act obligates the United States
government to help Taiwan maintain self-defense capabilities, and each
administration has sold it arms packages. The United States is Taiwan's
main arms supplier. [The Taiwan defense ministry requested the weapons
in the latest package]{.underline}, which was first reported by Reuters
on Wednesday. Congress would have to be notified of the deal before it
could go forward. [Trump administration officials have
become]{.underline} increasingly [**worried** about the intentions of
Chinese leaders toward Taiwan]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} they also
[regard Taiwan as an important **counterweight** to China]{.underline}
in the region. Though China's military capabilities still lag far behind
those of the United States, the People's Liberation Army has worked on
weapons systems, including anti-ship ballistic missiles, that might
prove effective against the United States Navy in the event of conflict
in the Taiwan Strait. In recent months, the Pentagon has ordered naval
ships to sail through the Taiwan Strait with increasing frequency, in
shows of strength that officials call freedom of navigation exercises.
[The proposed purchase of tanks and missiles is consistent with Taiwan's
**deterrence strategy**]{.underline}, said Bonnie S. Glaser, a senior
adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"[They would help **prevent an invasion**]{.underline}, [making it
difficult for an invading P.L.A. force to establish a beachhead in
northern Taiwan]{.underline}," she said, referring to the People's
Liberation Army. "I expect the Trump administration to approve this
package, as part of a policy of bolstering Taiwan's defenses." She added
that [the next package was likely to be for **66 F-16 fighter
jets**]{.underline}, a sale that members of Congress have been informed
is currently under discussion, according to an American official. The
Defense Department referred questions about the proposed sale to the
State Department on Thursday. The State Department said it does not
comment on proposed arms sales until officials formally notify Congress.
Arms packages to Taiwan have grown in cost in recent years, in part
because of technological advancement. During the Obama administration,
the costliest package was approved in 2011. Almost the entire amount of
that \$5.8 billion package consisted of upgrades to an aging fleet of
F-16's that Taiwan had bought in 1992. Taiwan had requested a new batch
of five dozen F-16's, but did not get them. President Trump has made
trade the centerpiece of the relationship between the United States and
China, but his top Asia policy officials are also focused on the
military rivalry. The United States has previously approved two weapons
deals with Taiwan during Mr. Trump's presidency, one two years ago for
\$1.4 billion and another last year for \$330 million. The White House
had previously considered weapons requests from Taiwan in packages
bundled together in groups, so that the sales could be timed to minimize
potential backlash from China. But the Trump administration last year
informed Congress that it would instead consider sales as they were
requested, as the United States does with other countries. On his Europe
trip this week, Mr. Trump spoke with Western officials about American
concerns over China, including over a potential security threat if
European nations allowed the Chinese company Huawei to build
next-generation 5G communications networks. The two top China policy
officials in the White House's National Security Council were on a list
of 130 or so attendees last weekend at the secretive Bilderberg Meeting
in Montreux, Switzerland, an annual gathering of Western political and
business leaders. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also spoke with
European officials about China during his four-country tour of Europe
that began last Friday in Germany and ended early Wednesday in Britain.
"[China wants to be the **dominant** economic and military power of the
world]{.underline}, spreading its authoritarian vision for society and
its corrupt practices worldwide," Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference
on Monday at The Hague with Stef Blok, the Dutch foreign minister. "We
talked today about these shared concerns and as well as the concerns
about technology --- infrastructure and technology and the 5G
infrastructure network."

### Impacts: Deterrence Works/Credible

#### Deterrence works -- Taiwan can defeat China with US arms, and the PLA knows it

**Greer 18** (Tanner Greer is a writer and analyst formerly based out of
Beijing. His research focuses on the evolution of East Asian strategic
thought from the time of Sunzi to today, 9-25-2018, \"Taiwan Can Win a
War With China,\" Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/25/taiwan-can-win-a-war-with-china/)SEM

When Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke to the 19th Party Congress about
the future of Taiwan last year, his message was ominous and unequivocal:
"We have firm will, full confidence, and sufficient capability to defeat
any form of Taiwan independence secession plot. We will never allow any
person, any organization, or any political party to split any part of
the Chinese territory from China at any time or in any form." This
remark drew the longest applause of his entire three-hour speech---but
it's not a new message. [The invincibility of Chinese arms in the face
of Taiwanese "separatists"]{.underline} and the inevitability of
reunification [are constant Chinese Communist Party themes]{.underline}.
At its base, the threat made by Xi is that the People's Liberation Army
has the power to defeat the Taiwanese military and destroy its democracy
by force, if need be. Xi understands the consequences of failure here.
"We have the determination, the ability and the preparedness to deal
with Taiwanese independence," he stated in 2016, "and if we do not deal
with it, we will be overthrown." [China has already ratcheted up
economic and diplomatic pressure on the island]{.underline} since the
2016 election of Tsai Ing-wen and the independence-friendly Democratic
Progressive Party. Saber-rattling around the Taiwan Strait has been
common. [But China might not be able to deliver on its repeated
threats]{.underline}. Despite the vast discrepancy in size between the
two countries, [**there's a real possibility that Taiwan could fight off
a Chinese attack---even without direct aid from the United
States.**]{.underline} Two recent studies, one by Michael Beckley, a
political scientist at Tufts University, and the other by Ian Easton, a
fellow at the Project 2049 Institute, in his book The Chinese Invasion
Threat: Taiwan's Defense and American Strategy in Asia, provide us with
a clearer picture of what a war between Taiwan and the mainland might
look like. [Grounded in statistics, training manuals, and planning
documents from the PLA itself, and informed by simulations and
studies]{.underline} conducted by both the U.S. Defense Department and
the Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense, [this research presents a
very different picture of a cross-strait conflict than that hawked by
the party's official announcements. Chinese commanders fear they may be
forced into armed contest with an enemy that is **better trained**,
**better** **motivated**, and **better** **prepared** for the rigors of
warfare than troops the PLA could throw against them. A cross-strait war
looks far less like an inevitable victory for China than it does a
**staggeringly risky gamble.**]{.underline} Chinese army documents
imagine that this gamble will begin with missiles. For months, the PLA's
Rocket Force will have been preparing this opening salvo; from the
second war begins until the day the invasion commences, these missiles
will scream toward the Taiwanese coast, with airfields, communication
hubs, radar equipment, transportation nodes, and government offices in
their sights. Concurrently, party sleeper agents or special forces
discreetly ferried across the strait will begin an assassination
campaign targeting the president and her Cabinet, other leaders of the
Democratic Progressive Party, officials at key bureaucracies, prominent
media personalities, important scientists or engineers, and their
families. The goal of all this is twofold. In the narrower tactical
sense, [the PLA hopes to destroy]{.underline} as much of [the Taiwanese
Air Force on the ground]{.underline} as it can and from that point
forward keep things chaotic enough on the ground that the Taiwan's Air
Force cannot sortie fast enough to challenge China's control of the air.
The missile campaign's second aim is simpler: paralysis. With the
president dead, leadership mute, communications down, and transportation
impossible, the Taiwanese forces will be left rudderless, demoralized,
and disoriented. This "shock and awe" campaign will pave the way for the
invasion proper. [This invasion will be the largest amphibious operation
in human history]{.underline}. Tens of thousands of vessels will be
assembled---mostly commandeered from the Chinese merchant marine---to
ferry 1 million Chinese troops across the strait, who will arrive in two
waves. Their landing will be preceded by a fury of missiles and rockets,
launched from the Rocket Force units in Fujian, Chinese Air Force
fighter bombers flying in the strait, and the escort fleet itself.
Confused, cut off, and overwhelmed, the Taiwanese forces who have
survived thus far will soon run out of supplies and be forced to abandon
the beaches. Once the beachhead is secured, the process will begin
again: With full air superiority, the PLA will have the pick of their
targets, Taiwanese command and control will be destroyed, and isolated
Taiwanese units will be swept aside by the Chinese army's advance.
Within a week, they will have marched into Taipei; within two weeks they
will have implemented a draconian martial law intended to convert the
island into the pliant forward operating base the PLA will need to
defend against the anticipated Japanese and American counter-campaigns.
[This is the best-case scenario for the PLA.]{.underline} [**But an
island docile and defeated two weeks after D-Day is not a guaranteed
outcome**. One of the central hurdles facing the offensive is surprise.
The PLA simply will not have it. The invasion will happen in April or
October. Because of the **challenges posed by the strait's weather**, a
transport fleet can only make it across the strait in one of these two
four-week windows. The scale of the invasion will be so large that
**strategic surprise will not be possible**, especially given the
**extensive mutual penetration** of each side by the other's
intelligence agencies.]{.underline} Easton estimates that Taiwanese,
American, and Japanese [leaders will know that the PLA is preparing for
a cross-strait war more than 60 days before hostilities
begin]{.underline}. They will know for certain that an invasion will
happen more than 30 days before the first missiles are fired. [This will
give the Taiwanese **ample time** to move much of their command and
control infrastructure into hardened mountain tunnels, move their fleet
out of vulnerable ports, detain suspected agents and intelligence
operatives, litter the ocean with sea mines, disperse and camouflage
army units across the country, put the economy on war footing, and
distribute weapons to Taiwan's 2.5 million reservists.]{.underline}
There are only 13 [beaches]{.underline} on Taiwan's western coast that
the PLA could possibly land at. Each of these [has already been prepared
for a potential conflict. Long underground
tunnels]{.underline}---complete with hardened, subterranean supply
depots---[crisscross the landing sites.]{.underline} The berm of each
beach has been covered with razor-leaf plants. Chemical treatment plants
are common in many beach towns---meaning that [invaders must prepare for
the clouds of toxic gas]{.underline} any indiscriminate saturation
bombing on their part will release. This is how things stand in times of
peace. [As war approaches, each beach will be turned into a **workshop
of horrors**]{.underline}. The path from these beaches to the capital
has been painstakingly mapped; once a state of emergency has been
declared, [each step of the journey will be complicated or
booby-trapped.]{.underline} PLA war manuals warn soldiers that
skyscrapers and rock outcrops will have steel cords strung between them
to entangle helicopters; [tunnels, bridges, and overpasses will be
rigged with munitions]{.underline} (to be destroyed only at the last
possible moment); and building after building in Taiwan's dense urban
core will be transformed into small redoubts meant to drag Chinese units
into drawn-out fights over each city street. [To understand the **real
strength of these defenses**, imagine them as a PLA grunt would
experience them]{.underline}. Like most privates, he is a countryside
boy from a poor province. He has been told his entire life that Taiwan
has been totally and fatally eclipsed by Chinese power. He will be eager
to put the separatists in their place. Yet events will not work out as
he has imagined. In the weeks leading up to war, he discovers that his
older cousin---whose remittances support their grandparents in the Anhui
countryside---has lost her job in Shanghai. All wire money transfers
from Taipei have stopped, and the millions of Chinese who are employed
by Taiwanese companies have had their pay suspended. Our private
celebrates the opening of hostilities in Shanwei, where he is rushed
through a three-week training course on fighting in the fetid and
unfamiliar jungles of China's south. By now, the PLA has put him in a
media blackout, but still rumors creep in: Yesterday it was whispered
that the 10-hour delay in their train schedule had nothing to do with an
overwhelmed transportation system and everything to do with Taiwanese
saboteurs. Today's whispers report that the commander of the 1st Marine
Brigade in Zhanjiang was assassinated. Tomorrow, men will wonder if
rolling power outages really are just an attempt to save power for the
war effort. But by the time he reaches the staging area in Fuzhou, the
myth of China's invincibility has been shattered by more than rumors.
The gray ruins of Fuzhou's PLA offices are his first introduction to the
terror of missile attack. Perhaps he takes comfort in the fact that the
salvos coming from Taiwan do not seem to match the number of salvos
streaking toward it---but abstractions like this can only do so much to
shore up broken nerves, and he doesn't have the time to acclimate
himself to the shock. Blast by terrifying blast, his [confidence that
the Chinese army can keep him safe is chipped away.]{.underline} The
last, most terrible salvo comes as he embarks---he is one of the lucky
few setting foot on a proper amphibious assault boat, not a civilian
vessel converted to war use in the eleventh hour---but this is only the
first of many horrors on the waters. Some [transports are sunk by
Taiwanese torpedoes, released by submarines]{.underline} held in reserve
for this day. [Airborne Harpoon missiles, fired by F-16s leaving the
safety of cavernous, nuclear-proof mountain bunkers]{.underline} for the
first time in the war, will destroy others. The greatest casualties,
however, will be caused by sea mines. [Minefield after minefield must be
crossed by every ship]{.underline} in the flotilla, some a harrowing
eight miles in width. Seasick thanks to the strait's rough waves, our
grunt can do nothing but pray his ship safely makes it across. As he
approaches land, the psychological pressure increases. The first craft
to cross the shore will be met, as Easton's research shows, with a
sudden wall of flame springing up from the water from the miles of
oil-filled pipeline sunk underneath. As his ship makes it through the
fire (he is lucky; others around it are speared or entangled on sea
traps) [he faces]{.underline} what Easton describes as a mile's worth of
"[razor wire nets, hook boards, skin-peeling planks, barbed wire fences,
wire obstacles, spike strips, landmines, anti-tank barrier walls,
anti-tank obstacles ... bamboo spikes, felled trees, truck shipping
containers, and junkyard cars]{.underline}." At this stage, [his safety
depends largely on whether the Chinese Air Force has been able to able
to distinguish between real artillery pieces from the hundreds of decoy
targets and dummy equipment]{.underline} PLA manuals believe the
Taiwanese Army has created. The odds are against him: As Beckley notes
in a study published last fall, in the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War, the 88,500
tons of ordnance dropped by the U.S.-led coalition did not destroy a
single Iraqi road-mobile missile launcher. NATO's 78-day campaign aimed
at Serbian air defenses only managed to destroy three of Serbia's 22
mobile-missile batteries. [There is no reason to think that the Chinese
Air Force will have a higher success rate when targeting Taiwan's mobile
artillery and missile defense.]{.underline} But if our grunt survives
the initial barrages on the beach, [he still must fight his way through
the main Taiwanese Army groups, 2.5 million armed reservists dispersed
in the dense cities and jungles of Taiwan, and miles of mines, booby
traps, and debris]{.underline}. This is an enormous thing to ask of a
private who has no personal experience with war. It is an even great
thing to ask it of a private who naively believed in his own army's
invincibility. [This sketch makes sense of the anxiety the PLA officer
manuals express. They know war would be a terrific gamble, even if they
only admit it to each other. Yet it this also makes sense of the party's
violent reactions to even the smallest of **arms sales to
Taiwan**.]{.underline} Their passion betrays their angst. They
understand what Western gloom-and-doomsters do not. [American analysts
use terms like "mature precision-strike regime" and "anti-access and
area denial warfare" to describe technological trends that make it
extremely difficult to project naval and airpower near enemy shores.
Costs favor the defense: It is much cheaper to build a ship-killing
missile than it is to build a ship.]{.underline} But if this means that
the Chinese army can counter U.S. force projection at a fraction of
America's costs, it also means that the [democracies straddling the East
Asian rim can deter Chinese aggression at a fraction of the PLA's
costs]{.underline}. In an era that favors defense, [small nations like
Taiwan do not need a PLA-sized military budget to keep the Chinese at
bay]{.underline}. No one needs to hear this message more than the
Taiwanese themselves. In my trips to Taiwan, I have made a point of
tracking down and interviewing both conscripts and career soldiers.
Their pessimism is palpable. This morale crisis in the ranks partly
reflects the severe mismanagement of the conscription system, which has
left even eager Taiwanese patriots disillusioned with their military
experience. But just as important is the lack of knowledge ordinary
Taiwanese have about the strength of their islands' defenses. A recent
poll found that 65 percent of Taiwanese "have no confidence" in their
military's ability to hold off the PLA. Absent a vigorous campaign
designed to educate the public about the true odds of successful
military resistance, the Taiwanese people are likely to judge the
security of their island on flawed metrics, like the diminishing number
of countries that maintain formal relations with Taipei instead of
Beijing. The PLA's projected campaign is specifically designed to
overwhelm and overawe a demoralized Taiwanese military. The most crucial
battlefield may be the minds of the Taiwanese themselves. Defeatism is a
more dangerous threat to Taiwanese democracy than any weapon in China's
armory. [Westerners and Taiwanese should be more optimistic about the
defense of Taiwan]{.underline} than is now normal. Yes, the Taiwanese
Army projects that it can only hold off its enemy for two weeks after
the landing---but [the PLA]{.underline} also [believes that if it cannot
defeat the Taiwanese forces in under two weeks, **it will lose the
war**!]{.underline} Yes, the disparity between the military budgets on
both sides of the strait is large, and growing---but [the Taiwanese do
not need parity to deter Chinese aggression. All they need is the
freedom to purchase the sort of arms that make invasion unthinkable. If
that political battle can be resolved in the halls of Washington, the
party will not have the power to threaten battle on the shores of
Taiwan.]{.underline}

As American politics is consumed with the prospect of (yet another)
government shutdown, the People's Republic of China has taken possession
of the first batch of the highly advanced, Russian-built S-400
anti-aircraft missile defense system. For the uninitiated, the S-400
system is considered by many experts to be the best anti-aircraft system
ever built. It can fire four missiles at once and can potentially track
and destroy stealth fighters--including advanced American stealth
planes, like the much-ballyhooed F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The system
can fire four missiles simultaneously at multiple targets, at varying
altitudes and distances--as far out as 400 km (about 248 miles). The
S-400 batteries are being placed in China's southeastern province of
Fujian, according to the Asia Times Online. As they report, the issue at
hand is that not only can these missile batteries be used for defensive
purposes, but depending on the missile that is loaded into these
launchers, the weapons can threaten the Senkaku Islands (which are
contested by both the Chinese and the Japanese governments and have thus
far been the source of much friction in the region), and more
importantly, can vastly complicate Taiwan's already-threatened defensive
position. [China has gone through a political and economic
**transformation**]{.underline} not just over the last 30 years, but
also in the last five. [Since Xi]{.underline} Jinping [rose to
power]{.underline}, [a greater degree of **militarism**]{.underline},
**[nationalism]{.underline}**, [and **centralization of power** has
occurred]{.underline}. Under Xi, "corrupt" political and military
leaders have been arrested and tried for various "crimes" (in many
cases, their only crimes were being potential rivals to Xi's power).
Hong Kong has experienced a retinue of political perturbations between
the democratically-minded Hong Kongers and their Communist Party
overlords. [China's military has undergone a historic **modernization**
campaign]{.underline}. The Chinese economy has surprisingly weathered a
series of economic storms fairly well to the point that the Chinese
economy is stronger and more well-suited for global competition than at
any other point over the last eight years. And, [under Xi]{.underline},
[China has **switched** from its]{.underline} "[peaceful
rise]{.underline}" [strategy of wooing]{.underline} its [dubious
neighbors with **soft power**]{.underline} [to
**threatening**]{.underline} and cajoling [them]{.underline}, in much
the same way that the Chinese emperors of old did. Enter Taiwan. For
decades, Taiwan has been a deep wound in the Chinese Communist Party's
psyche. During the heady days of the Cold War, the West viewed Taiwan as
an "unsinkable aircraft carrier." It was a source of power projection
for the United States deep into China, thereby complicating the Chinese
government's attempts to expand their sphere of influence outward. Since
those days, many changes have occurred in the United States as well as
in Taiwan and China itself. First, the United States has become
untethered from its once-erstwhile Taiwanese allies. Since the great
rapprochement between the United States and China under President
Richard Nixon, Taiwan has been increasingly isolated on the world stage.
Under President Jimmy Carter, the United States made the egregious error
of kowtowing to China's demands of recognizing the government in Beijing
as the only legitimate government of China (and Taiwan) without allowing
for Taiwan to fall back under China's rule. Second, the founding party
of Taiwan's independent government, the Guomindang (GMD), has morphed
from a fiercely anti-Chinese Communist Party movement into a nominally
friendly pro-China party, seeking greater ties with the mainland (which
would ultimately lead to reunification). Third, the Chinese, as noted
above, have switched from a more pro-trade, conciliatory approach to
Taiwan into a more forceful stance. Currently, China is feeling its
oats, as it were. Since the election of Donald Trump into office, the
world has wrongly assumed that the United States was abandoning its
traditional role as the guarantor of the international system. Now, the
world looks around for a new guarantor of the international order. Many
are looking to the economic juggernaut of Germany or the economic and
military power of China. Within these shifting views of America's role
in the world, is an implicit assumption that a rising great power like
China will be able to have its way in what it perceives as its sphere of
influence. Since the end of the Chinese Civil War, the Beijing
government has viewed Taiwan as a breakaway province--the place that
their rivals in the Chinese Civil War had fled to after losing the war.
[To the Chinese]{.underline}, [had it not been for the intervention and
support from the West]{.underline}, [Taiwan would have been taken by
China by force]{.underline}. [It has long been a policy of the Chinese
government to **reunite** with Taiwan]{.underline}--so long as the
Taiwanese accept Beijing (and therefore Communist) rule. Keep in mind,
also, that [it is not just Chinese pride that is driving]{.underline}
their [aggression]{.underline} toward Taiwan. [It is also the perception
of China being **encircled**]{.underline} [by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its allies. Right now, the Trump Administration
is necessarily engaged in a standoff with the Chinese ally of North
Korea over their nuclear program. President Trump is doing this because
the United States is obligated to defend South Korea and Japan--two
targets of North Korea--as well as to defend the United States, which
North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un has consistently threatened with nuclear
destruction. Even as China has sought to engage in the kabuki dance of
publicly siding with the Trump Administration whilst maintaining cordial
relations with North Korea, the Chinese government has been put in a
position where it (wrongly) believes that it has no territorial
integrity, so long as American forces continue acting freely in what
China perceives as its own backyard. The purchase of the S-400 system;
the embrace of the more provocative foreign policy under Xi, are part of
a larger Chinese worldview that believes it is constantly threatened by
outside forces seeking to dismember and subjugate China, as the old
Western colonial empires did yesteryear. Thus, [so long as Taiwan
remains **independent**]{.underline}, **[democratic]{.underline}**, [and
oriented toward the West]{.underline}, [the Chinese will continue their
**provocations** toward their neighbors]{.underline}, believing that
they have no strategic depth with which to defend their mainland. Of
course, these archaic views are not realistic. The United States has no
intention of attacking or invading China (unless China oversteps and
attacks an American ally or the United States directly). In fact, in
recent years, American military aid to Taiwan has been fairly low
key--and in no way upsets the balance of power between the mainland and
Taiwan. [China wants Taiwan weak and isolated so that it can easily roll
into Taiwan]{.underline}. [They will not be happy until the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[disavows]{.underline}** its
**[support]{.underline}** of Taiwan [entirely]{.underline}, [and allows
the Chinese to continue **expanding** their **military
reach**]{.underline} [into the second island-chain beyond China's
coast]{.underline}. In so doing, the Chinese believe they will have an
effective defensive perimeter that would keep the United States Navy
outside of the economically dynamic Asia-Pacific, and allow China to
fulfill its most fantastical irredentist objectives of rehabilitating
the old Chinese Empire. Contrary to what China's leaders believe, most
Asian states do not want to be made into vassal states of China's new
"All Under Heaven." They prefer to balance against China with American
military power; relying on China for economic trade and the United
States for defense. While this is an entirely ~~idiotic~~ calculation
for all parties, this is the reality we face. The Taiwanese have
politically evolved separately from their Chinese brothers on the
mainland. A deeply rooted democratic culture, as well as a vibrant free
market economy has arisen on the island. Any reunification with the
mainland would slowly crush that pro-Western, democratic spirit. Many in
the West view a reunification between Taiwan and China as an acceptable
result, if only to avoid a catastrophic conflict with China (which does
not view the Taiwanese issue with much rationality). They assume that a
more amicable cross-strait relations would likely help to create a less
caustic reunification, much the same way that Hong Kong's return to
China played out in 1997. But, as we've witnessed over the last few
years, China has steadily undermined the English civil laws that have
long-defined Hong Kong's legal, political, and economic system. Beijing
under Xi has fought desperately to erode the democratic freedoms most
Hong Kongers enjoy and the legal certitude that Hong Kong inherited from
the English. For President Xi and his fellow Communists, the democratic
freedom and Western-style legal system that Hong Kong has is a direct
threat to Beijing's rule. Hong Kong has been a key driver for China's
economic growth. What neither Xi nor his fellow Communist Party members
in China recognize is that Hong Kong's legal system is a major reason
why so many international businesses and countries like doing business
in Hong Kong. If that were to change (which it is changing), Hong Kong
would lose its economic dynamism. Make no mistake, should a more
peaceable, slower reunification with Taiwan occur, almost the exact same
fate would befall Taiwan. [This would not only be a human tragedy for
Taiwan]{.underline}, [but it would also be a diminution of America's
**credibility**]{.underline}. Like it or not, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' inability [to make a **decisive
stand**]{.underline} [for or against Taiwanese independence has
**hemmed** U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. [If we supported Taiwan
**fully**]{.underline}--and called for their recognition as an
independent state--it would rankle the Chinese and complicate our
relations with them. However, [it would help to hone in American policy
in the region]{.underline}. If we chose to deny Taiwanese statehood and
make our policy commensurate with Beijing's, it would at least
ameliorate a potential conflict. Right now, our 40 year policy toward
Taiwan is not only undermining our relations with Beijing, but it is
also giving false hope to Taiwan, while at the same time threatening to
harm American credibility. Very few believe that the United States would
risk a war with China over Taiwan. Yet, [we are obligated to act in
defense of Taiwan]{.underline}, [should China attack]{.underline}.
Personally, I find it reprehensible that we would abandon a democracy
like Taiwan to their fate--particularly since the Taiwanese have an
advanced military and have only to receive the right amount of military
aid to deter a Chinese invasion. The arrival of the S-400 system is part
of a larger Chinese modernization effort aimed at having the capability
to overwhelm whatever defenses Taiwan has. Fact is, the United States
has been derelict in providing the right countermeasures that Taiwan
would need to believably deter China from greater aggressive action. For
all of the discussion about the S-400 "Triumf" system, American war
planners have proven in Syria that the ubiquitous Tomahawk cruise
missiles are more than capable of penetrating the defensive layers of
the S-400 system, and can hit their targets unimpeded. In 2015, the
United States Navy embarked on an effort to modernize their EA-18
Growler fleet, to make them capable of "weapons quality track" of enemy
"emitters." In other words, despite the newfangled technology in the
S-400 system, old school systems, like cruise missiles and slightly
upgraded EA-18 Growlers can be used to suppress and overcome those
Russian-built defenses whilst threatening Chinese targets. The more
serious concern that the S-400 raises is in its capabilities to track
targets as far using methods can penetrate American stealth technology.
This is made even more dangerous by the fact that China claims to have
tested its newly built quantum radar that they plan on integrating with
the S-400. Even still, there are relatively low-cost ways for American
systems to complicate China's perceived new advantages enough to avoid
the kind of hostile action that many believe China is planning against
Taiwan as early as 2020. Whether the United States manages to craft a
more sensible policy toward not only Taiwan, but all of the
Asia-Pacific, the fact remains that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is **treaty-bound** to help defend Taiwan from
attack]{.underline}. [Whatever advantages the Chinese believe they've
built over the last several years]{.underline}--from amphibious warfare
capabilities to the aforementioned S-400--[the fact remains that their
new systems are]{.underline} **[mostly untested]{.underline}** [and can
be mitigated with existing American technology]{.underline}. My
recommendation would be to give Taiwan scores of cruise missiles (or to
encourage the Taiwanese to build massive amounts of their own cruise
missiles), coupled with the EA-18 Growlers (as well as the E-2D Hawkeyes
that support the Growlers) that would be needed to suppress and overcome
the Chinese S-400 threat. Taiwan has a handful of Hawkeyes and would
need considerable amounts of Growlers to make their S-400
countermeasures fully effective. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [must make selling Taiwan]{.underline} these
**[upgraded systems]{.underline}** [a **major priority** in its
relations with Taiwan]{.underline}. [The point is to
**raise**]{.underline} the **[costs]{.underline}** [on any potential
Chinese invasion]{.underline} of Taiwan [to such a level that they have
no choice but to engage in more **peaceable relations** with
Taiwan]{.underline}, [thereby reducing the risk to America]{.underline}.

### Impacts: Lose Taiwan = China PP

#### Chinese acquisition of Taiwan vastly expands power projection and further threatens US interests

spent two decades covering military and security issues in Asia,

TAIPEI --- Those focusing on whether China can sink a U.S. aircraft
carrier or lob missiles at Guam are missing the larger problem. And it
is not about the tragic loss of a democratic friend in Asia. **[The
nightmare is how the strategic landscape will radically change if China
controls Taiwan]{.underline}**, either by political or brutal force.
[China views Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines as one long
wall.]{.underline} Bud Cole, the celebrated specialist on Chinese naval
issues, dubbed it the "[The Great Wall at Sea]{.underline}" for good
reason. Insurmountable in geographic terms; with no line of sight for
its aircraft, let alone navy, [Beijing has no other choice but to take
Taiwan. Taiwan's central mountain range runs the length of the island
with heights ranging from nine thousand to twelve thousand feet. **This
is the problem China faces in its efforts to project force into the
Pacific**. The Chinese air force must fly around Taiwan, the navy must
sail through the Japanese-controlled Ryukyu Islands chain]{.underline}
that stretches from Japan to Taiwan, [and mainland's ground-based radar
cannot peek over Taiwan. What would a post--invasion Taiwan look like?
**The occupation of Chinese military forces on Taiwan would basically
turn the tables on the United States**. The "wall" would now be a U.S.
problem in terms of line-of-sight.]{.underline} China has radically
shifted the power balance in the South China Sea with the same island
occupying philosophy. [Islands are taken, then armed, and territorial
lines are expanded]{.underline} via dubious "legal" declarations, such
as exclusive economic zones, fishing grounds, historical claims that go
back hundreds of years. The declaration of an Air Defense Identification
Zone (ADIZ) is only a matter of time for both the South China Sea and
eventually Taiwan airspace. Taiwan's fighter capabilities are not being
renewed at a rate to stop Chinese advances in fighters and electronic
warfare. Even if Taiwan procures new F-16Vs it will still face a
significant problem in air power projection as China increases fighter
patrols that are performing circumnavigation patrols of the island. [If
Taiwan fell tomorrow, the Chinese navy could use the northeast naval
base of Suao as a **submarine base**]{.underline}. Not just any ordinary
base, but [a far better one than Yulin Naval Base]{.underline} on Hainan
Island, where Chinese nuclear submarines leave their mountain cave
facilities to enter the shallow waters of the South China Sea. [At Suao
the waters off the coast drop into the abyss, giving submarines a far
better ability to drop below thermal layers and vanish.]{.underline}
Though Suao is a medium-sized port it is where the 168th Flotilla
corrals six Knox-class frigates, ten Perry-class frigates, and four
Kidd-class destroyers, along with a logistics hub. The rear side of the
base has a high-pitched mountainous backside that could be carved out
for submarine tunnels like Yulin. Most of Taiwan's eastern coast is
rugged mountains that push directly into the ocean. [The second base of
great envy by China is Taiwan's Hualien Air Force Base]{.underline},
which is the home of the 401st Wing with three squadrons of F-16 fighter
aircraft. Located just south of Suao, [the base has a "nuclear proof"
bunker]{.underline} carved out from the inside of Chiashan Mountain.
Having been one of the few Americans to get inside the enormous
facility, it struck me as something from a James Bond movie (minus the
Ninjas repelling from the ceiling). Only one other airbase uses a
catacomb of underground facilities and that is Taitung on the southeast
coast. The base's Shihzishan (Stone Mountain) is not as big as Chiashan
Mountain but can house around three fighter squadrons during an attack.
At present, the base is home for the 737rd Tactical Combined Wing's F-5
Tiger fighter aircraft used for training. [Both airbases could be home
to China's fighter aircraft]{.underline}, such as the J-11/J-15/J-16,
all with a range of two thousand miles and a combat range of half. This
does not include the use aerial refueling to increase patrol time. China
is planning a refueler variant of its new Y-20 strategic airlifter,
which would extend their patrol time and range. [The occupation of these
three bases on Taiwan's east coast---Suao, Hualien, Taitung---**will
force United States and Japanese naval forces to face Chinese air power
projection directly for the first time in the Pacific.**]{.underline}
One should not ignore Chinese forces on Taichung Air Force Base and
Kaohsiung Naval Base on Taiwan's west coast. Both would be dream bases
for H-6K bombers and Type 055 destroyers, respectively. [Once China
establishes military bases on the island, then the Taiwan Strait could
be **closed to commercial traffic**]{.underline} at Beijing's whim for
either political, economic or military agendas. Middle East [oil and
gas]{.underline} traveling up the Taiwan Strait and the eastern coast to
Korea and Japan [would be under China's strategic umbrella. Japan and
Korea would have to consider tailoring its foreign policies in Beijing's
favor]{.underline}. This could be done in a variety of ways, such as
voting in China's favor in the United Nations, closure of U.S. military
bases, accept Beijing's trade rules, etc. U.S. intelligence losses would
include the hobbling of the Japanese Fishhook sonar program that Taiwan
also participates. Fishhook is a series of sonar stations along the
Ryuku Island chain from Japan to Taiwan. Added shuttering would include
the U.S.-Taiwan signal intelligence facility at Pingtun Li on
Yangmingshan Mountain. Not to mention intelligence collected from other
antenna facilities around Taiwan, including Linkou and Betel Nut
Village. All of which have provided enormous value to U.S. National
Security Agency and Pacific Command. [China views Taiwan as nothing more
than a rock to occupy]{.underline}. China is using the same
island-hopping mindset in the South China Sea that the United States
used during World War II in the Pacific. [That is the kind of thinking
Beijing uses to justify its motivation **to expand its military power**.
Perhaps the United States should rethink its strategy in Asia in the
same terms.]{.underline}

### Impacts: U.S. Heg/Primacy

\-- about chinese a2/ad

[Taiwan]{.underline} is a country under siege as it [faces the prospect
of eventual reunification with China]{.underline}, on China's terms, and
potentially [as soon as **2021**]{.underline}---the centenary of the
founding of the Chinese Communist Party. From Xi Jinping's perspective,
the successful reunification of China and Taiwan, through force if
necessary, would firmly entrench his position as China's paramount
leader, with prestige far exceeding Mao Zedong's or Deng Xiaoping's.
Achieving that goal quickly is seen by Xi as an essential prerequisite
for realising the 'China Dream' of national rejuvenation. As 'a rich
country with a strong army', [China would be]{.underline}, in every
sense, a new middle kingdom---[a **global superpower** for the 21st
century]{.underline}---[that ultimately **eclipses** the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Several factors have led to
an escalation of **coercive pressure** on Taiwan]{.underline} in recent
years. Xi is increasingly impatient with Taiwan's president, Tsai
Ing-wen, who has refused to accept the 1992 consensus and the concept of
'one China'. Tsai's position is understandable: Taiwan is a strong and
vibrant democracy and a majority of its population identify themselves
not as Chinese, but Taiwanese. Pro-independence forces are gathering
support, and Tsai is conscious of this growing sentiment in her
Democratic Progressive Party base. She can't ignore the will of the
majority of Taiwan's people. [Taiwan's improving relationship with the
Trump administration is also a concern for Beijing]{.underline}.
[Washington has agreed to **new arms sales**]{.underline} totalling
US\$1.42 billion---a move that has angered Beijing. The US 2018 National
Defense Authorization Act permits US Navy warships to visit Taiwan, and
the Taiwan Travel Act signed into law in March allows two-way exchanges
between US and Taiwanese officials. The US has opened a de facto embassy
in Taipei, the American Institute of Taiwan. And Republican and Democrat
senators have introduced the Taiwan Allies International Protection and
Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act, which would penalise states that
take adverse action against Taiwan under pressure from China.
Nevertheless, China continues to steadily reduce Taiwan's international
diplomatic reach by persuading the dwindling number of countries that
have previously recognised Taipei to recognise Beijing. That strategy
weakens Taiwan's diplomatic efforts to gain international support. Yet
losing the odd Pacific Island supporter here or Central American state
there will mean little if the Trump administration moves to deepen its
ties with Taipei as part of a broader strategy of counterbalancing a
rising China. So rather than biding his time and waiting to see Taiwan
incorporated into China by 2049---the centenary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China---might Xi seek to move much sooner? Adam Ni
argues that there are various trends pushing cross-strait relations
towards a more confrontational path. He notes that Taiwan's younger
population identify less with the mainland, in spite of efforts by
Beijing to use economic inducements to gain their support. Ni also
argues that [there's a perception in Beijing that in spite of closer
US--Taiwan ties under President Donald Trump]{.underline}, [the US
**lacks** the **resolve** to go to war against China over
Taiwan]{.underline}. Now is Beijing's opportunity to achieve
China--Taiwan reunification, through the use of force if necessary. 'The
trajectory is quite scary at the moment. [There's a perception in China
that it's their time in the sun]{.underline}. [This hubris
is]{.underline} really **[dangerous]{.underline}**. [They think the US
wouldn't dare intervene because of the huge cost of doing
so]{.underline}, but it would be disastrous for everyone if China is
underestimating US resolve', Ni says. Thus [the significance of PLA Navy
and Air Force operations around Taiwan is very real]{.underline}. These
exercises are designed to wear down Taiwanese operational readiness and
coerce the Tsai government into accepting a more conciliatory
cross-strait policy. They also allow the PLA to establish control of the
battlespace, gather intelligence on Taiwanese military responses, and
practise for a cross-strait clash. [A recent report highlighted these
operations as the **centrepiece** of any PLA move that could culminate
in a full-scale invasion]{.underline}, unless Beijing could coerce
Taiwan's leadership into submission through a combination of an air and
naval blockade and air and missile strikes. An amphibious invasion would
be incredibly costly for the PLA, given the nature of Taiwan's defence
capabilities. Taiwan's mountainous and forested geography would make it
ideal for the Republic of China Army to undertake a prolonged insurgency
against any occupying PLA forces. So taking Taiwan militarily certainly
won't be a low-cost or quick operation. [The Taiwanese approach also
seems set on taking the fight to the enemy]{.underline}, [through
developing indigenous capabilities to strike back in the event of
Chinese attacks]{.underline}. **[Still]{.underline}**, [Taiwan remains
**deeply dependent** on US intervention]{.underline}. [If China
successfully secured Taiwan]{.underline}, what then? Control of Taiwan
means [China effectively can use the island to project military power
along the **first island chain**]{.underline}, [in a manner that
reinforces its control of the **S**]{.underline}outh
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea, [challenges Japan in the
Senkakus and Ryukyus]{.underline}, [and places greater pressure on the
US position in Guam]{.underline}. [Control of Taiwan is a **strategic
lynchpin**]{.underline} [for Chinese power in the Western
Pacific]{.underline}. [It would strengthen China's ability to
**exploit**]{.underline} anti-access and area denial
(**[A2/AD]{.underline}**) [to ensure sea control and control of the air
within near and middle seas]{.underline}, [to deter or defeat any US
intervention into the Western Pacific]{.underline}. [That opens up all
sorts of possibilities for a **restored**]{.underline} middle
**[kingdom]{.underline}** [ready to reassert its domination]{.underline}
of Asia. Beijing may be tempted to call Washington's bluff on the
assumption that it won't respond. China may think that such an
outcome---achieving forced reunification of Taiwan and China,
strengthening China's dominance of East Asia, and ending US strategic
primacy in Asia---may be worth the risk of a war across the straits.
Conversely, failure to retake Taiwan would spell the end of China's
ambition to dominate Asia, and would certainly finish Xi as leader for
life. [With Beijing's pressure steadily building]{.underline}, [keeping
an eye on events across the Taiwan Strait is more important than
ever]{.underline}.

[[Analysts in support of a continued relationship with Taiwan argue
that]{.mark} a deepened [partnership would help the U.S. **project power
against China's A2/AD capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The U.S.
has developed]{.underline}]{.mark} an [**[A]{.mark}**ir-**[S]{.mark}**ea
**[B]{.mark}**attle]{.underline} concept, [in which the [combined
abilities of air and naval forces will work with alliances and coalition

stated "[Services should integrate our efforts with each other and with

allies and new friends.]{.underline}" The U.S. thus far has not given
Taiwan a role in their rebalancing initiative and rather focused on
other allies in the region such as Japan, South Korea and Australia.
However, **[the U.S. is missing a valuable opportunity to enhance their

the new model of F-16 aircrafts and opted to upgrade their existing set
instead[.]{.underline} In an effort to maintain an adequate level of
self-defense, Taiwan has started developing its own weapons and pursued
arms sales from other countries (CNA). China's military strength and
increased uncertainty of U.S. support have reduced Taiwan's confidence
in dealings with China. Furthermore, in the past 6 years, Taiwan has
gradually reduced the percentage of GDP dedicated to defense. The
resulting asymmetrical power balance runs contrary to the goals of the
TRA by decreasing Taiwan's chances of self-determination.

What are **[Taiwan's potential contributions]{.underline}**? For
starters, [[Taiwan is the principle security partner in the
region]{.mark} that is willing and able to develop the kind of force
needed for networked, integrated deep interdiction operations in an
A2/AD environment]{.underline}. [[Taiwan's knowledge of]{.mark} single

interdict single points of failure in the PLA's A2/AD system could
relieve the United States of part of its heavy operational burden and

Department may tap the expertise on Taiwan, the earliest and most
intense target of Chinese computer network operations]{.underline}.
[Taiwan's geographic position and willingness to contribute to a
regional common operational picture, including maritime domain
awareness, air surveillance, and space surveillance and tracking, could
be of significant value for both disaster response and military
purposes.]{.underline} More care must be taken to build in firewalls to
ensure potential adversaries are unable to penetrate U.S. networks
through those of its allies and partners. Furthermore, releasing
space-based systems to Taiwan, including broadband communications and
remote sensing satellites, could contribute to broader regional
situational awareness architecture not only for military purposes but
also for civil disaster preparedness and response. Taiwan's
participation in regional maritime domain awareness architecture may
also be worthy of consideration.

#### Failure to develop a response to A2AD in Asia spills-over -- means Russia will invade Eastern Europe

**Fontaine, CNAS president, 2015**

(Richard, "Anti-Access/Area Denial Isn't Just for Asia Anymore",
<http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2015/04/anti-accessarea-denial-isnt-just-asia-anymore/109108/>)

[If there's one set of foreign military capabilities that has garnered
U.S. attention in recent years, it's those related to anti-access and
area denial]{.underline}. Even the most acronym-constrained policymakers
regularly cite A2/AD and its challenge to American power projection in
the western Pacific. And with good reason: China's investments in
ballistic and cruise missiles, submarines, air defenses and
counter-maritime forces have focused military minds on the East Asian
littoral's increasingly contested nature, and on ways in which the
United States and its allies might overcome the growing challenges.
[Anti-access is, however, not merely an Asian affair]{.underline}. While
Washington continues its rebalance to the Pacific, [Russia's aggression
in Ukraine has dragged the U.S. back to Europe and to a renewed focus on
the continent's attendant security threats. As NATO and [Pentagon
planners]{.mark} begin to envision the previously unimaginable --
conflict with Russia in Europe's east -- they [must focus on
Moscow's]{.mark} growing [A2/AD capabilities]{.mark} and strategies [and
move quickly to **apply the lessons from Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[Russia's ability to contest the landmass in Europe's east
may]{.mark} actually [exceed China's capacity to keep American forces
away from thousands of miles of coastline]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
R[ussia is currently probing all over the north Atlantic region, testing
defenses]{.underline} at sea, in the air, and on land. NATO has reported
more than 100 Russian intrusions into European airspace over the past
year, sometimes by planes that turn off their transponders as they fly
dangerously close to commercial aircraft. Near-misses have occurred at
sea as well. Earlier this month, Russian fighter-bombers practiced
attack scenarios against NATO warships in the Black Sea; last fall, a
suspected Russian submarine violated Sweden's territorial sovereignty.
On land, Russia is conducting snap exercises on its Baltic frontier and
has announced that it will send Iskander missiles to Kaliningrad, which
borders Poland and Lithuania. [Reason dictates that such probing will
remain just that; it would be folly for Russia to pursue aggression
against a NATO member. **Yet [Moscow's embrace of hybrid warfare in
eastern Ukraine has shown how a brazen, revanchist nationalism rules
Russian foreign policy.]{.mark} A**]{.underline}s a result, it's worth
thinking hard about what a contingency in Europe might comprise.
[Specifically, the West needs to prepare for a scenario in which it is
denied access to the countries on NATO's eastern flank long enough to
establish facts on the ground that would be hard, and perhaps
impossible, to reve]{.underline}rse. If the fighting in Ukraine is any
example, [we could expect Russia to move quickly to seize
railheads]{.underline}, as it has done in Debaltseve, and to contest
airspace, as separatists have done in downing Ukrainian aircraft. It
would take control of key transportation routes and airports, like it
did in Donetsk, and attack ports, as it has done in Mariupol. Russia
would also move aggressively to dominate the cyber domain and prevent
communications among opposing forces while conducting information
operations and covert activities to harden local populations against a
western force and incite Russian minorities. (Related: Here's When the
Next Incursion Into Ukraine Could Happen) [With the relative paucity of
American forces and materiel prepositioned in the east, in a contingency
the United States would need to surge quickly into the
region]{.underline}. American and allied forces would depend on ports,
roads, railways and airspace in which Russia would deploy its large and
growing A2/AD capabilities. To cite just one example, the general
commanding U.S. air forces in Europe recently said that one-third of
Poland is covered by Russia's integrated air defense system. Other NATO
members, such as the Baltic nations, likely sit within range of Russian
anti-aircraft missiles. U.S. policymakers have largely focused on
deterring further aggression, reassuring NATO allies, and imposing
costs, especially diplomatic and economic penalties, on Russia for its
actions in Ukraine. Some of these efforts are helpful in confronting the
A2/AD challenge, including increasing NATO air-policing patrols over the
Baltics, rotating ground troops in the east, prepositioning military
equipment, and planning to counter Russia's sophisticated electronic
warfare capabilities. But much [more is needed]{.underline}. **[[One
answer to the anti-access]{.mark} challenge [in Asia has been]{.mark}
the vaunted [A]{.mark}ir-[S]{.mark}ea [B]{.mark}attle
concept]{.underline}** (now awkwardly rechristened the "Joint Concept
for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons"), [[which would harness
cutting-edge tech]{.mark}nologies to overwhelm and overcome enemy
efforts to contest domains]{.underline}. [In Europe, if anything, the
problem may be more profound, with any NATO effort to project power
likely to confront challenges in the air, land, sea, space, and cyber
domains.]{.underline} Washington and its allies should start with a
complete review of U.S. force posture in Europe. That doesn't
necessarily mean the United States should return two heavy brigades to
Europe, but it should determine whether its forward presence on the
continent is sufficient to prevent Russia from denying the U.S. access
in a crisis. In addition, the transatlantic allies should begin
exercises that focus specifically on the A2/AD challenge. The recent
"Dragoon Ride," which had U.S. Strykers traveling 1,100 miles across
Europe, was a good start. NATO should also mine American efforts in Asia
for lessons that apply in Europe; increase prepositioning; and exploit
technologies including longer-range aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles,
and stealthy platforms. And Washington should lock in the rotational
forces that are currently in the region, ensure continued funding to
support U.S. training and exercises in Europe and avoid any near-term
withdrawals of U.S. forces from the European continent. [During the Cold
War, the United States spent an enormous amount of time and resources
preparing for what it hoped would never materialize: a military
confrontation with the Soviets on European soil. Since the fall of the
Berlin Wall, many of those efforts have languished as the United States
and its allies have turned to an array of expeditionary challenges in
faraway places. **In the face of Russia's aggression in Ukraine and its
near-constant probing in, above and around European borders, it is high
time for the United States and Europe to renew critical muscle movements
after years of atrophy. Russia will no doubt call such efforts
escalatory. Yet [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies
[cannot afford to assume]{.mark} that [we have the seen the end]{.mark}
[of Russia's ambitions]{.mark} for the region. They should hope for the
best, but plan for otherwise.**]{.underline}

clash between London and Moscow after the Defence Secretary, Michael
Fallon, said [there was a \"real and present danger\" Mr Putin could try
to destabilise the Baltic states with a campaign of subversion and
irregular warfare.]{.underline} The Kremlin called those comments
"absolutely unacceptable\". Sir Adrian told the Royal United Services'
Institute there was a danger such a campaign of undercover attacks could
paralyse Nato decision making, as members disagreed over how much Russia
was responsible, and how to respond. Nato commanders fear a campaign of
skilfully disguised, irregular military action by Russia, which is
carefully designed not to trigger the alliance\'s mutual defence pact.
[He said the \"resulting ambiguity\" would make \"collective decisions

Sir Adrian, one of the most senior generals in the British Army and a

danger that Russia could use conventional forces and Soviet-era
brinkmanship to seize Nato territory. [He said [Russia had shown last
year it could generate large conventional forces at short notice for

of course a classic Soviet technique." **[He went on to say that "[the

**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, large [[rivals]{.mark} of the United
States [are modernizing]{.mark} their military
[forces]{.mark}]{.underline}, grabbing strategic real estate,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[threatening]{.underline}]{.mark} vulnerable
U.S. [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Their goal is]{.mark} not just
[to]{.mark} assert hegemony over their neighborhoods but to **[rearrange
the global security order]{.mark}** as we have known it since the end of
the Second World War.]{.underline}

We first wrote about these emerging dynamics in 2010, and then in TAI in
2011. We argued three things. First, that revisionist powers were using
a strategy of "probing": a combination of assertive diplomacy and small
but bold military actions to test the outer reaches of American power
and in particular the resilience of frontier allies. Second, we argued
that the small, exposed allies who were the targets of these probes were
likely to respond by developing back-up options to U.S. security
guarantees, whether through military self-help or accommodation. And
third, we argued that that China and Russia were learning from one
another's probes in their respective regions, and that allies themselves
were drawing conclusions about U.S. deterrence in their own neighborhood
from how America handled similarly situated allies elsewhere.

Five years later, as we argue in a new book released this month,
**[these dynamics have intensified dramatically]{.underline}**.
[[Revisionist powers]{.mark} are indeed probing the United
States]{.underline}, but their methods [[have
become]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[bolder]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [more
violent---and successful.]{.underline} [[Allies]{.mark} have grown more
alert to this pressure, [amid]{.mark} the steady [whittling away
of]{.mark} neighboring [buffer zones]{.mark}, and **[have begun to
pursue]{.mark} an array of [self-help]{.mark} schemes [ranging from arms
build-ups to flirtations with]{.mark} the nearby [revisionist
power.]{.mark}**]{.underline} It has become harder for the United States
to isolate security crises to one region: [Russia's land-grabs in
Eastern Europe provide both a model and distraction effect for China to
accelerate its maritime claims in the South China Sea; Poland's quest
for U.S. strategic reassurance unnerves and spurs allies in the Persian
Gulf and Western Pacific]{.underline}.

By degrees, **[[the world is entering the path to
war.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Not since the 1980s have the conditions been
riper for a major international military crisis. [Not since the 1930s
has the world witnessed the emergence of multiple large, predatory
states determined to revise the global order to their
advantage]{.underline}---if necessary by force. At a minimum, [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates in coming years could face the
pressure of managing several deteriorating regional security
spirals]{.underline}; at a maximum, it [**[could be confronted with a
Great Power war]{.mark}** [against]{.mark}]{.underline} one, and
possibly two or even [[three, **nuclear-armed peer
competitors.**]{.underline}]{.mark} In either case, the U.S. military
could face these scenarios [[without]{.mark} either the presumption of
[tech]{.mark}nological [overmatch]{.mark} or favorable force ratios that
it has enjoyed against its rivals for the past several
decades.]{.underline}

How should the United States respond to these dynamics? As our rivals
grow more aggressive and our military edge narrows, we must look to
other methods for waging and winning geopolitical competitions in the
21st century.

The most readily available but underutilized tool at our disposal is
alliances. America's frontline allies offer a mechanism by which it can
contain rivals---indeed, this was the original purpose for cultivating
security linkages with small states in the world's rimland regions to
begin with. In coming years, the value of strategically placed allies
near Eurasia's large land powers will grow as our relative technological
or numerical military strength shrinks. The time has come for the United
States to develop a grand strategy for containing peer competitors
centered on the creative use of frontline allies. It must do so now,
before geopolitical competition intensifies.

Predatory Peers

Probing has been the strategy of choice for America's modern rivals to
challenge the existing order. Over the past few years, Russia, China,
and, to a degree, Iran have sensed that the United States is retreating
in their respective regions---whether out of choice, fatigue, weakness,
or all three combined. But they are unsure of how much remaining
strength the United States has, or of the solidity of its commitments to
allies. Rather than risking direct war, they have employed low-intensity
crises to test U.S. power in these regions. Like past revisionists, they
have focused their probes on seemingly secondary interests of the
leading power, either by humbling its weakest allies or seizing gray
zones over which the United States is unlikely to fight. These probes
test the United States on the outer rim of its influence, where the
revisionist's own interests are strongest while the U.S. is at its
furthest commitments and therefore most vulnerable to defeat. Russia has
launched a steady sequence of threatening military moves against
vulnerable NATO allies and conducted limited offensives against former
Soviet satellite states. China has sought out low-intensity diplomatic
confrontations with small U.S. security clients, erected military no-go
zones, and asserted claims over strategic waterways.

When we wrote about this behavior in The American Interest in 2011, it
was composed mainly of aggressive diplomacy or threatening but small
military moves. But the probes of U.S. rivals are becoming bolder.
Sensing a window of opportunity, in 2014 Russia upped the ante by
invading Ukraine---the largest country in Eastern Europe---in a war that
has so far cost 7,000 lives and brought 52,000 square kilometers of
territory into the Russian sphere of influence. After years of using
unmarked fishing trawlers to harass U.S. or allied naval vessels, China
has begun to militarize its probes in the South China Sea, constructing
seven artificial islands and claiming (and threatening to fight over)
1.8 million square kilometers of ocean. Iran has recently humiliated the
United States by holding American naval vessels and broadcasting photos
of surrendering U.S. sailors. In all cases, revisionist powers increased
the stakes because they perceived their initial probes to have
succeeded. Having achieved modest gains, they increased the intensity of
their probes.

The strategic significance of these latest probes for the United States
is twofold. First, they have substantially increased the military
pressure on frontline allies. The presence of a buffer zone of some
sort, whether land or sea, between allies like Poland or Japan and
neighboring revisionist powers, helped to reduce the odds of sustained
contact and confrontation between allied and rival militaries. [By
successfully encroaching on or invading these middle spaces,
revisionists have advanced the zone of contest closer to the territory
of U.S. allies, increasing the potential for a deliberate or accidental
military clash.]{.underline}

Second, the latest probes have significantly raised the overall pressure
on the United States. As long as Russia's military adventures were
restricted to its own southern periphery, America could afford to shift
resources to the Pacific without worrying much about the consequences in
Europe---an important consideration given the Pentagon's jettisoning of
the goal to be able to fight a two-front war. With both Ukraine and the
South China Sea at play (and with a chaotic Middle East, where another
rival, Iran, advances its reach and influence), the United States no
longer has the luxury of prioritizing one region over another; with two
re-militarized frontiers at opposite ends of the globe, it must
continually weigh trade-offs in scarce military resources between
geographic theaters. This disadvantage is not lost on America's rivals,
or its most exposed friends.

Frontier Frenzy

The intensification of probing has reverberated through the ranks of
America's frontline allies. In both Europe and Asia, the edges of the
Western order are inhabited by historically vulnerable small or
mid-sized states that over the past seven decades have relied on the
United States for their existence. The similarities in the geopolitical
position and strategic options of states like Estonia and Taiwan, or
Poland and South Korea, are striking. For all of these states, survival
depends above all on the sustainability of U.S. extended deterrence, in
both its nuclear and conventional forms. This in turn rests on two
foundations: the assumption among rivals and allies alike that the
United States is physically able to fulfill its security obligations to
even the smallest ally, and the assumption that it is politically
willing to do so.

Doubts about both have been growing for many years. Reductions in
American defense spending are weakening the U.S. military capability to
protect allies. Due to cuts introduced by the 2009 Budget Control Act,
the U.S. Navy is smaller than at any point since before the First World
War, the U.S. Army is smaller than at any point since before the Second
World War and the U.S. Air Force has the lowest number of operational
warplanes in its history. Nuclear force levels are static or declining,
and the U.S. technological edge over rivals in important weapons types
has diminished. The Pentagon in 2009 announced that for the first time
since the Second World War it would jettison the goal of being able to
conduct a two-front global war.

At the same time that U.S. capabilities are decreasing, those of our
rivals are increasing. Both Russia and China have undertaken large,
multiyear military expansion and modernization programs and the
technological gap between them and the United States is narrowing,
particularly in key areas such as short-range missiles, tactical nuclear
weapons, and fifth-generation fighter aircraft.

Recent American statecraft has compounded the problem by weakening the
belief in U.S. political will to defend allies. The early Obama
Administration's public questioning of the value of traditional
alliances as "alignments of nations rooted in the cleavages of a
long-gone Cold War" shook allied confidence at the same time that its
high-profile engagement with large rivals indicated a preference for
big-power bargaining over the heads of small states. The U.S.-Russia
"reset" seemed to many allies both transactional and freewheeling, and
left a lasting impression of the suddenness with which U.S. priorities
could shift from one Administration to the next. This undermined the
predictability of patronage that is the sine qua non of effective
deterrence for any Great Power.

As the revisionists' probes have become more assertive and U.S.
credibility less firm, America's frontier allies have started to
reconsider their national security options. Five years ago, many
frontline states expressed security concerns, began to seek greater
military capabilities, or looked to offset risk by engaging
diplomatically with revisionists. But for the most part, such behavior
was muted and well within the bounds of existing alliance commitments.
However, as probing has picked up pace, allied coping behavior has
become more frantic. In Europe, Poland, the Baltic States, and Romania
have initiated military spending increases. In Asia, littoral U.S.
allies are engaged in a worrisome regional arms race. In both regions,
the largest allies are considering offensive capabilities to create
conventional deterrence. Their willingness to build up their indigenous
military capabilities is overall a positive development, but it carries
risks, too, spurring dynamics that were absent over the past decades.
The danger is that, absent a consistent and credible U.S. overwatch,
rearming allies engage in a chaotic acquisition strategy, poorly
anchored in the larger alliance. Fearing abandonment, such states may
end up detaching themselves from the alliance simply by pursuing
independent security policies.

There is also danger on the other side of the spectrum of possible
responses by frontline allies. Contrary to the hopeful assumptions of
offshore balancers, not all frontline allies are resisting. Some are
choosing strategies of accommodation. Bulgaria, Hungary, and Slovakia in
Europe and Thailand and Malaysia in Asia are all examples of nominal
U.S. allies that are trying to avoid antagonizing the stronger predator.
Worsening regional security dynamics create domestic political pressures
to avoid confrontation with the nearby revisionist power. Full-fledged
bandwagoning in the form of the establishment of new alliances is not
yet visible, but hedging is.

Seeds of Disorder

The combination of intensifying probes and fragmenting alliances
threatens to unravel important components of the stability of major
regions and the wider international order. Allowed to continue on their
current path, security dynamics in Eastern Europe and the Western
Pacific could lead to negative or even catastrophic outcomes for U.S.
national security. One increasingly likely near-term scenario is a
simmering, simultaneous security competition in major regions. In such a
scenario, rivals continue probing allies and grabbing middle-zone
territory while steering clear of war with the United States or its
proxies; allies continue making half-measure preparations without
becoming fully capable of managing their own security; and the United
States continues feeding greater and greater resources into frontline
regions without achieving reassurance, doggedly tested and put in doubt
by the revisionists. Through a continued series of probes, the
revisionist powers maintain the initiative while the United States and
its allies play catch up. The result might be a gradual hardening of the
U.S. security perimeter that never culminates in a Great Power war but
generates many of the negative features of sustained security
competition---arms races, proxy wars, and cyber and hybrid
conflicts---that erode the bases of global economic growth.

A second, graver possibility is war. [[Historically, a lengthy series
of]{.mark} successful [probes]{.mark} has often [culminated in]{.mark} a
**[military confrontation.]{.mark}**]{.underline} One dangerous
characteristic of today's international landscape is that not one but
two revisionists have now completed protracted sequences of probes that,
from their perspective, have been successful. [If the purpose of probing
is to assess the top power's strength, today's probes could eventually
convince either Russia, China, or both that the time is ripe for a more
definitive contest.]{.underline} It is uncertain what the outcome would
be. Force ratios in today's two hotspots, the Baltic Sea and South China
Sea, do not favor the United States. [[Both **Russia** and **China**
possess significant]{.mark} anti-access/area denial ([A2AD]{.mark})
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, with a ten-to-one Russian troop
advantage in the Baltic and massive Chinese preponderance of coastal
short-range missiles in the South China Sea. Moreover, both powers
possess nuclear weapons and, in Russia's case, a doctrine favoring their
escalatory use for strategic effect. And even if the United States can
maintain overwhelming military superiority in a dyadic contest, war is
always the realm of chance and a source of destruction that threatens
the stability of the existing international order. Having failed a
series of probes, the United States could face the prospect of either a
short, sharp war that culminates in nuclear attack or an economically
costly protracted two-front conflict. Either outcome would definitely
alter the U.S.-led international system as we know it.

A third, long-term possibility is a gradual eviction of the United
States from the rimland regions. This could occur either through a
military defeat, as described above, or through the gradual hollowing
out of U.S. regional alliances due to the erosion of deterrence and
alliance defection---and therefore this scenario is not mutually
exclusive of the previous two. For the United States, this would be
geopolitically disastrous, involving a loss of position in the places
where America must be present to prevent the risk of hemispheric
isolation. Gaining a foothold in the Eurasian rimlands has been a major,
if not the most important, goal of U.S. grand strategy for a century.
[[It is through]{.mark} this [**presence** that the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [is able to shape global politics and avoid]{.mark}
the emergence of [mortal threats]{.mark} to itself.]{.underline}
[[Without]{.mark} such a [presence]{.mark}, America's largest
[rivals]{.mark} would be able to steadily [aggrandize]{.mark}, building
up enlarged [spheres of influence]{.mark}]{.underline}, territory, and
resources that would render them capable of sustained competition for
global primacy. Unlike in the 20th century, current
**[[A2AD]{.underline}]{.mark}** and nuclear technology would

#### Taiwan lobbyists are growing in power and influence over Congress -- arms sales are a key issue

**Wilson 16** (Megan R., 12-7-2016, covers lobbying at Bloomberg,
\"Taiwan lobby scores victory with Trump call,\" TheHill,
https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/309120-taiwan-lobby-scores-victory-with-trump-call)SEM

President-elect Donald [Trump's call with the president of Taiwan was a
watershed moment for **lobbyists** who have worked for years to create
closer ties with the United States.]{.underline} While Trump and his
team have downplayed the call as merely congratulatory, it is being
interpreted around the world as a sign that the president-elect intends
to change U.S. policy toward Taiwan in defiance of China. A U.S.
president had not communicated with leaders in Taiwan since 1979, when
the United States cut diplomatic ties. Since then, official U.S. policy
has been to recognize the People's Republic of China as the sole legal
government of China. [American leaders have]{.underline}, however, still
[provided security assistance and arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}, in
addition to expressing support for the country overall. [**Entities
connected to Taiwan's government have lobbied aggressively in Washington
over the years**. This year alone, they've paid out more than **\$1.3
million in fees to 10 law and lobbying firms**. Six of the 10 lobbying
firms working on behalf of Taiwanese interests work for]{.underline} the
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office
([TECRO]{.underline}), the de facto embassy in Washington established in
the absence of formal diplomatic relations. [The firms]{.underline}
working for Taiwan [include Gephardt Group Government
Affairs]{.underline}, run by former Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.); [the
Nickles Group]{.underline}, founded by former Sen. Don Nickles
(R-Okla.); [Alston & Bird]{.underline}, a law and lobby firm that
features advocacy work by former Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.); [and the
Daschle Group]{.underline}, started by former Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).
The Trump call has "forced us to reexamine our policies in Asia," said
Nathan Daschle, the chief operating officer of the Daschle Group who
also works on the Taiwan account. "Sometimes the political marketplace
is not perfect. Taiwan is a great example of that," he said. "[Firms
like ours come in and try to achieve solutions that are good for our
client and good for our country]{.underline}. With Taiwan, the two are
almost always in sync." [From April through September of this year,
TECRO paid the Daschle Group \$162,000.]{.underline} "A lot of people,
whether or not they have a financial interest at stake, are happy this
door is opened," Daschle added. China has pushed back on the phone call
with Trump, though it has mostly directed its anger at Taiwan. Chinese
state-owned media, however, penned a stinging op-ed about the call.
"Provoking friction and messing up China-US relations won't help 'make
America great again,' " read the page-one opinion article from People's
Daily. Daschle, the son of the former senator, said Trump's call with
Taiwan is a good example of why he won the presidency in the first
place. "Donald Trump clearly understands the American electorate very
well. A lot of people struggle to understand why it's a problem to
accept a phone call from a close ally who shares our values and wants
our leadership out of fear of angering a country that doesn't," Daschle
said. "This protocol might make sense to people inside D.C., but it
doesn't make sense to most everyone outside D.C." [Disclosure forms
submitted to the Justice Department show that **lobbyists for Taiwan
have been courting allies on Capitol Hill**]{.underline}. [Lobbyists
made a push for a congressional trip to visit the island and invited
lawmakers to a Washington inaugural celebration for Taiwan's president,
Tsai Ing-wen]{.underline}, who was elected in January. Many firms
involved in lobbying for Taiwan either did not respond to a request for
comment about their work for the island or declined to comment. Aside
from seeking closer U.S. relations, [advocates for Taiwan have also
worked on]{.underline} trade issues, **[arms sales]{.underline}** and
legislation directing the secretary of State to help Taiwan obtain
observer status in the International Criminal Police Organization
(Interpol), disclosure forms say. Congress did pass a bill granting
Taiwan observer status, which President Obama signed earlier this year.
**[There is growing support on Capitol Hill for boosting the
relationship with Taiwan]{.underline}**, advocates told The Hill ---
**[including the bipartisan Senate Taiwan Caucus.]{.underline}** On
Tuesday, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters that criticism was
"much ado about nothing," noting that he had also spoken to Taiwan's
leader recently. Dole --- a special counsel at Alston & Bird --- led the
charge to work with the Trump campaign in the months before Election
Day, according to a review of disclosure documents first reported by
BuzzFeed. The former Senate majority leader also arranged a meeting
between Trump surrogate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and the Taiwanese
ambassador and led a Taiwanese delegation through meetings at the
Republican National Convention in Cleveland over the summer, records
reviewed by The Hill show. Dole has continued to work with the Trump
presidential transition team, including providing briefings, and may
have had a role in the call between the president-elect and Tsai,
according to public records and a report by The Wall Street Journal.
"It's fair to say that we may have had some influence," Dole told the
Journal. He also scored a White House tour for a visiting delegation.
TECRO paid Alton & Bird \$60,000 from November 2015 through April 2016.
During the next six-month period, from May through October, the firm
took in \$140,000 in fees. During the 2012 presidential campaign, Dole
reached out to GOP nominee Mitt Romney, documents reveal. The firm also
reached out to former Gen. David Petraeus when he was CIA director and
Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of State. [Outside groups with no
connection to the island have also been pushing Washington policymakers
to increase their involvement with the Taiwanese
government]{.underline}, known as the Republic of China. [**The U.S.
Taiwan Business Council**, an advocacy group funded entirely by American
businesses, has been working on the issue for decades]{.underline}. Its
president, Rupert Hammond-Chambers, said he was heartened by the call.
"In my view, Trump injected some much needed credibility into the
relationship with Taiwan," he said. "What I expect is a more balanced
relationship between U.S., Taiwan and China, and not the deferential
relationship to China we've seen in the last eight years."

outlined above would obviously face many obstacles]{.underline}. [The

in the form of resistance by both U.S. and Taiwanese politicians to any
American efort to limit defense assistance to Taiwan as part of a larger
understanding with Beijing and criticism among Chinese nationalists that
any agreement to limit China's military options in pressuring Taiwan to
enter into political talks with Beijing or in deterring moves toward
independence would undermine China's sovereignty claim over the
island]{.underline}. In addition, some Taiwanese politicians would
undoubtedly argue that any U.S. discussion with Beijing involving the
island's security situation would constitute a betrayal of Taiwan and
Taiwanese democracy. And military professionals on all sides would
probably argue that any signifcant limitation on the ability to employ
force in an unexpected future crisis afecting the island would increase,
rather than reduce, instability by weakening deterrence.

### Uniq: Taiwan Stops China Now

#### Taiwan is serving as a bulwark against Chinese expansionism now.

Summary The ongoing [tensions between the United States and
China]{.underline}, which have come to partly define the Trump
presidency, [have seen both sides strive to gain economic, military and
geopolitical advantage]{.underline}. Their ongoing trade negotiations
appear to have captured the interest of observers and analysts but a
close second, if that is indeed what it is, would have to be their
dispute over the Republic of China (Taiwan). Having reacquired Hong Kong
and Macau, **[[Taiwan remains the]{.mark} [last]{.mark} geographical
[region]{.mark} that [Beijing claims it must]{.mark}
"[re-integrate]{.mark}" in order to right some of the wrongs it has
historically suffered]{.underline}**. So important is that reintegration
to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that it comes second only to the
very survival of the Party itself. From the political perspective, [if
the CCP is to claim a legitimate hold on power and, simultaneously,
maintain the legitimacy of its authoritarian rule, it must necessarily
absorb a democratically-run region to demonstrate that its authoritarian
rule is superior to democracy]{.underline}. Taiwan also remains an
embarrassment to Beijing in that it is proof that the citizens of a
democratically-run Chinese country, which Beijing considers a breakaway
province, enjoy a standard of living, including various personal
freedoms, far above those of Chinese citizens on the mainland. Those
aspects aside, [**[Taiwan represents the most tangible and immediate
impediment to]{.mark}** the [securitisation of]{.mark} **China's** [sea
trade, together with]{.mark} any **[maritime ambitions it may have in
the region and further afield]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
**[[island's]{.mark} geographic [position allows it to thwart virtually
all power projection from the mainland]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
[island chain]{.underline}, of which Taiwan is a major part, stretches
from Japan to the Philippine archipelago, [virtually encompassing the
entire Chinese mainland which arcs into the Pacific Ocean]{.underline}.
[Taiwan lies offshore in the centre of the Chinese coastline; it has,
therefore, the potential to block all of China's access to the
ocean]{.underline}. In naval terms, [[Taiwan]{.mark} [could]{.mark}
potentially [block the Chinese north and south fleets from
amassing]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[It is]{.mark} also [the most
effective barrier to Chinese naval operations beyond the island
chain]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China learned the value of Taiwan during
the Korean War of 1950-53. After US President [Truman ordered the
Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}, General Douglas
[MacArthur stated that]{.underline} Formosa
([[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[was]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[an]{.mark}
[unsinkable]{.mark} [aircraft carrier]{.mark}]{.underline}", [able [to
project American power]{.mark} along China's coast [in]{.mark} a
[containment]{.mark} strategy]{.underline}. The island's position, along
with its ties to the US, has caused resentment in Beijing because the
CCP cannot achieve its goal of national unification while also posing a
potentially major security threat to China's development. The Chinese
analyst Lin Zhibo sums up the situation: Militarily, **[[Taiwan is a
potential which the USA could use in the western
Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [use of Taiwan could enable
effective control of sea lines of communication between North-East Asia
and South-East Asia and the Middle East]{.underline}. ... Thus, the [USA
sees Taiwan as "an unsinkable aircraft carrier", [giving it a **maximum
degree of control over**]{.mark} **China's [East and South Sea
fleets]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[1\] [China has]{.underline}, in short,
[more than one reason to wish to absorb Taiwan and bring it under CCP
rule]{.underline}.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/11/28/trumps-china-policy-is-a-triumph-wto-trump-gdp/)//GA

U.S. President Donald **[Trump's aggressive approach to China has been
the most credible and consistent policy]{.underline}** [of an
often-criticized White House]{.underline}. The president's assertions of
Chinese [malfeasance in trade matters are undeniably true]{.underline}.
[Even]{.underline} CNN's Fareed [Zakaria, no fan of the president, has
said]{.underline}, "Donald [Trump is right: China is a trade
cheat]{.underline}," going on to praise the U.S. trade representative's
exhaustive report on China's World Trade Organization noncompliance as a
rare example of a quality document from this administration. Despite
dire warnings from establishment economists and media pundits that
getting tough on China would damage the U.S. economy, [we have seen
nothing of the kind. The United States is not simply surviving the trade
war but has thrived through two years of global stagnation]{.underline}.
In the meantime, as best as can be told from highly unreliable and
often-faked data, [Chinese economic growth has stalled]{.underline}.
**[The hard-line U.S. policy has been effective and should be maintained
until China demonstrates real, substantial behavioral change such as no
longer requiring forced joint partnerships and ceasing its vast
state-run cyberespionage program]{.underline}**. [Holding Beijing
accountable for its treatment of its own citizens isn't too much to ask
either]{.underline}. Then-President Bill Clinton's fateful decision to
disconnect U.S. human rights policy from trade deals in 1993 removed
America's most powerful instrument for producing good in the world. As
Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama subsequently adopted
Clinton's "business is business" policy, [the Chinese Communist Party
learned to exploit a complacent Western media to whitewash its
authoritarianism, militarism, and repression and greenwash its
environmental depravation]{.underline}. Lazy American journalists
eagerly reprinted half-truths generated by D.C. think tanks funded by
the multinational corporations growing rich on the China trade, as well
as quotes from professors at universities addicted to foreign student
tuition fees and wealthy Chinese donors. [Those who criticized
China]{.underline}, as I did, [were marginalized, maligned, and
censored]{.underline}. U.S. firms such as Google and Home Depot found
their attempts to actually access the promised mega-market wrecked by a
system tilted in favor of China's domestic champions. Still, the horrors
of Tibet and Tiananmen were obscured by iPhones and corporate profits.
Today, Americans enjoy movies from U.S. studios whose scripts are
written to avoid offending the Communist Party and are blissfully
unaware that [over a million Chinese citizens are being brutalized in
"re-education" camps designed to deprogram their religious
identities]{.underline}. [Trump holding China's hypersensitive
authoritarians accountable to international standards of decency in
trade was a badly overdue act of bravery]{.underline}, and one that
perhaps only an unabashedly indiscreet leader could pull off. **[The
very public shaming of Beijing over its blatantly closed markets,
transshipment of products, export subsidies, abuse of joint
partnerships, espionage, and technology theft has revealed the party's
claims as a sham]{.underline}**. All of these facts are superbly
documented in the aforementioned Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
report and in the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing's report
on China's economic aggression. The emperor's imaginary clothes vanished
in a wink. The promise implied by former U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger and others that appeasing and enriching China's brutal despots
would align them with U.S. interests or liberalize them can no longer be
defended with a straight face. Over the last two years, [establishment
pundits shifted from spouting nonsense about China's inevitable progress
toward capitalism and democracy to asking whether tariffs are the right
way to confront a dangerous regime we all agree is built on lies and
cheating]{.underline}. The initial results are now in. The [current
trade policy has demonstrated its effectiveness, and **it is undermining
the Communist Party's only source of legitimacy**]{.underline}:
ill-gotten economic growth. And on the U.S. side, [it's going to be
easier to maintain than most people think. The U.S. market remains the
most valuable economic prize on Earth, something this week's annual
Black Friday consumption-fest underscores]{.underline}. It is, by far,
the world's largest economy, with a 2017 GDP of \$19.4 trillion. That's
at least 60 percent larger than China's \$12.2 trillion and probably a
lot more, as [China's dubious GDP figures bend to fit official
targets]{.underline}. Since consumption forms a much larger part of
American GDP, the U.S. market for goods is many times larger than
China's. The United States is also the healthiest major economy, with
robustly increasing GDP growth and the lowest unemployment rate in
nearly 50 years. China is not likely to catch up in our lifetimes.
Additionally, the United States has a much smaller population dividing
those spoils---and being less burdened by taxes than their global
counterparts, U.S. consumers can spend far more than the citizens of any
large nation. Most importantly, [China is paying the lion's share of
America's tariffs]{.underline}. While advocates of free trade have
worked hard to scare consumers with threats of huge price increases,
these have not emerged. This is because any additional cost incurred in
the distribution of a product may be allocated to either the consumer,
through higher prices, or to the producer, through lower margins. The
[market determines this split as consumers demonstrate their tolerance
for absorbing higher prices]{.underline}. The elasticity of demand for
products determines the price, and a recent European study by EconPol
concludes, "A 25 percentage point increase in tariffs raises US consumer
prices on all affected Chinese products by only 4.5% on average, while
the producer price of Chinese firms declines by 20.5%." And don't forget
that the entire 25 percent goes into the U.S. Treasury, feeding
America's economy, not China's. [If Chinese prices eventually do
increase, the same system will force distributors and retailers to
absorb the cost before consumers]{.underline}. Their suppliers are
already moving to non-China sources. Significantly, **[none of this
success is accidental]{.underline}**. [Many of this administration's
political appointments have been criticized, and the president has
removed several of them]{.underline}. Trump has even publicly expressed
regret over his appointment of Steven Mnuchin as treasury secretary. In
contrast, the team at the White House National Trade Council, the
Department of Commerce, and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
have been brilliantly strategic in the face of a relentless,
China-backed media attack on the trade policy. The EconPol researchers
recognized this when they wrote, "The US government has strategically
levied import duties on goods with high import elasticities." Whether or
not you agree with the tactics crafted by White House trade advisor
Peter Navarro (with whom I wrote a book), Commerce Secretary Wilbur
Ross, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, **[this operation
has been professionally planned and executed]{.underline}**. Knowing
that China would quickly move to disguise its products in
transshipments, the Trump team expertly renegotiated complex deals with
South Korea, Mexico, and Canada in record time. A [critical and
disorganized Europe has been left scrambling to reassess its China
relations, lest its market become the dumping ground of last
resort]{.underline}. Investors buying in to the media prattle that U.S.
trade policy has been ill-informed or that soybeans are somehow more
important to the United States than technology do so at great peril. In
the face of this success, free trade backbiters are now calling for
negotiations. If you are under any delusion that this time, the Chinese
government will take a trade agreement with the West seriously, I
encourage you to read Articles 33 through 41 of the Chinese
Constitution, which reads like the U.S. Bill of Rights. This document
specifically protects human rights, freedom of religious beliefs,
freedom from illegal arrest, freedom from unreasonable search, freedom
of speech, and the right to vote and protest. None of these things
actually exist. Like the regime's official name, the "People's
Republic," rule of law in China has always been a lie the West agreed to
accept. The [Chinese Communist Party does not respect the rule of
law---**it respects strength and power**]{.underline}. The **[U.S.
president and his team should stay the course]{.underline}**, both for
America's sake and for China's. [Reducing the]{.underline} economic
[influence of an aggressive authoritarian regime is the right thing to
do for the world and, eventually, for the Chinese people]{.underline}.
They shouldn't bother with an agreement designed only to delay the other
side and that will never be honored. The new Democratic majority in the
lower house of the U.S. Congress and establishment Republicans who
otherwise oppose the president should re-evaluate the current trade
policy in light of the positive empirical results and eschew the
illusory arguments of those who benefit from enriching a dangerous and
tyrannical regime.

(Dan, "Beijing started this trade conflict --- Trump intends to finish
it",
https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/447579-beijing-started-this-trade-conflict-trump-must-finish-it)//GA

[There's an important point to remember in the current U.S.-China trade
conflict: **Beijing started it**]{.underline}. For the past 20 years,
[China has been at war with the U.S. economy, using massive subsidies,
currency manipulation and intellectual property theft to continually
erode America's manufacturing base]{.underline}. It's a strategy that
has worked phenomenally well. Over the past two decades, the United
States has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs and nearly 90,000
factories. After years of this economic aggression, the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[is now saying, "Enough is
enough."]{.underline}** But [when the president recently imposed
25-percent tariffs on roughly half of Chinese imports, Wall Street cried
foul]{.underline}. However, it was an absolutely unquestioning adherence
to free trade that opened the door for China in the first place. And
[globalists have never complained when Beijing continually ignores its
W]{.underline}orld [T]{.underline}rade [O]{.underline}rganization (WTO)
[commitments to open, reciprocal trade]{.underline}. So, what of the
tariffs that the president is now imposing? To listen to cable news
commentators, one would think the sky is falling. The [president's
critics continually tout dire economic warnings --- even though all
evidence shows the tariffs applied in 2018 on steel, aluminum and other
goods have boosted U.S. manufacturing and created domestic
jobs]{.underline}. A widely circulated paper by Trade Partnership
Worldwide warned that steel and aluminum tariffs would cost as many as
470,000 U.S. jobs. Instead, [U.S. manufacturing employment has increased
since then and now exceeds 12.8 million jobs]{.underline} --- the
highest level since the Great Recession. In the immediate wake of the
tariffs, third-quarter GDP grew at an impressive 3.5 percent in 2018.
[Inflation remains low]{.underline}, too, [demonstrating that consumers
aren't seeing predicted price increases]{.underline}. It's doubtful that
President Trump undertook the new tariffs lightly. In fact, he delayed
them in January --- to give Beijing more time to negotiate in good
faith. But after many months of talks and the formulation of a 150-page
draft agreement, **[Beijing did an about-face]{.underline}**. [China's
leaders simply reneged on an initial commitment to start opening their
markets and to halt such aggressive practices as IP theft, hacking and
forced technology transfer]{.underline}. That's what finally forced
President Trump's hand. He is continuing tariffs on \$50 billion worth
of Chinese imports while also raising tariffs to 25 percent on another
\$200 billion worth of goods. Half of China's imports to the U.S. are
now covered by the tariffs. **[This is strong medicine. But it's
necessary in the face of Beijing's intransigence and the ongoing erosion
of key national industries]{.underline}**. The United States must begin
to decouple from China. And as the 2018 tariffs have demonstrated, the
benefits outweigh the costs. The Coalition for a Prosperous America
(CPA) recently conducted research that examined the possibility of a
25-percent across-the-board tariff on all Chinese imports. That's more
than just the half of all imports currently facing tariffs. They found
that such a move would add more than 700,000 U.S. jobs over five years,
with GDP increasing by an additional \$125 billion. And much of that
growth would come in the manufacturing sector --- including almost
200,000 new factory jobs. Under such conditions, portions of U.S.
production would finally return from China. And [segments of China's
industrial capacity would also shift to lower-cost third countries ---
helping to reduce prices for U.S. consumers]{.underline}. Overall, an
across-the-board tariff could mean as much as \$69 billion worth of
production returning to the United States each year by 2024. There's a
growing conviction that economic integration with China was a mistake.
Our nation's leaders assumed that the United States would gain access to
China's vast population, and U.S. companies would export more goods to
China's consumers. They believed that Beijing would become more open and
democratic. But none of that happened. Instead, [China has used
predatory trade to capture the U.S. market and fund its military and
economic rise]{.underline}. And it has become a more authoritarian
surveillance state, with President Xi now spreading China's model
regionally and globally. President **[Trump's move to decouple from
China is a necessary step to insulate the United States from further
economic aggression]{.underline}**. And it's a needed effort, if the
U.S. is to integrate with more friendly countries while creating
good-paying jobs and prosperity at home.

### Uniq: Percept Contain High

For nearly two weeks, [China's top leaders]{.underline} disappeared from
public view as they gathered at a secluded beach resort in eastern Hebei
province this month. Though the heavily guarded gathering in Beidaihe
was secret, their [agenda was likely dominated by the trade war with the
United States -- and the emerging view that the nations' escalating
tensions **go beyond trade and economic disputes.** There are signs of a
new resolve that **sees the trade conflict as part of Washington's
design to temper China's rise to greater power**]{.underline}. While
Beijing is willing to continue engaging the US -- it has dispatched
commerce vice-minister Wang Shouwen to the US for talks this month --
[the earlier optimism of finding a quick solution has been replaced by a
grittier determination.]{.underline} Observers said Wang was unlikely to
achieve any breakthroughs other than paving the way for more
negotiations. "[Trump is very confident now]{.underline}, and China
should not appear weak," a former Chinese trade official said, referring
to US President Donald Trump. "China has to appear confident and stand
firm, resisting the maximum challenges by Trump. Making too many
concessions at an early stage will only push Trump to be more
provocative." Leading up to and during the Beidaihe meeting, state media
published a series of editorials and commentaries casting a harsher
light on Sino-US relations. A signed commentary published by party
mouthpiece People's Daily on August 10 said the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [had continued the]{.underline} "engagement plus
**[containment]{.underline}**" [**approach to China**, hoping to
significantly reshape China's development in America's
image.]{.underline} "A review of the trade negotiations with the US
shows the American government has been inconsistent, ambivalent and
capricious," it said. "But the behind-the-scenes logic is pretty clear
-- **[it is never just about narrowing trade deficits, but to contain
China in much broader areas]{.underline}**."

But two questions are not addressed by the revisionists: (1) [why do so
many governments in the region resist Chinese domination?
and]{.underline} (2) [why is Chinese domination of Asia inevitable
if]{.underline}, say, [U.S. domination of Cuba or Russian domination of
Poland is not inevitable?]{.underline} After all, [the Asia-Pacific has
many powerful nations: China, America, Russia, India, Indonesia, Japan,
and Australia]{.underline}. A conclusion contrary to the revisionist
claim that Beijing-Washington relations will flourish once Taiwan is no
longer an irritant is reached by two specialists in Chinese military
strategy. In their 2010 book \"Red Star over the Pacific: China\'s Rise
and the Challenge to U.S. Maritime Strategy,\" authors Toshi Yoshihara
and James R. Holmes note that **[China is a world power with \"strategic
aims far broader than a Taiwan contingency.\"]{.underline}**9 That is,
even [if Washington had the will and the power to abandon Taipei to
Beijing, China\'s global challenge to America and the region would
persist and grow]{.underline}. Contrary to the claim of the
revisionists, [**China will not concede to America** on other issues
that greatly matter to CCP ruling groups]{.underline}. [South Korea is a
U.S. military ally. Why would Beijing]{.underline}, as proposed by the
National Defense University analysts quoted above, [not seek to keep
North Korea from becoming part of a united democratic Korea, a next-door
neighbor?]{.underline} Is it merely because America helped China annex
Taiwan? **[Rulers in Beijing see China winning. They are not looking to
trade away vital interests]{.underline}**. The premise of U.S. strategic
logic should be the following: [to get China right, one must first get
the Asia-Pacific region right]{.underline}. [How]{.underline} then
[would America\'s friends and allies in the Asia-Pacific region respond
to a U.S. abandonment of a Taiwan that already accommodates China on
matters ranging from national identity to economic
integration?]{.underline} Fixating singularly on China, as if Japan,
Australia, ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Korea,
India, Russia, Mongolia, and Taiwan are insignificant, is not how to
analyze America\'s Asian Theater Strategy. The revisionists, however,
are correct that whenever defensive weapons are purchased by Taiwan,
Chinese leaders show anger. [This is supposedly because of Chinese
pride, ambition, and a constructed historical narrative that imagines
Taiwan as having been Chinese from time immemoria]{.underline}1.1°
Taking the CCP government\'s rhetoric as natural turns the disagreements
about U.S. policy toward Taipei into \"the Taiwan problem.\" Observers
who assume the issue is a \"Taiwan problem\" fail to focus on a key
reality. Since 1991, [the Chinese military has rationalized its huge
annual budget increases by claiming that an actually small, weak, and
accommodating Taiwan was a threat to China]{.underline}.11 Since Taiwan
in fact threatens no nation, [a realist should not blame the Taiwanese
for tensions caused by the ambitions of the CCP regime]{.underline}.
Rather than assessing how the ambitions of world-power China impact
American interests in Asia, [revisionists focus on **making ruling
groups in Beijing happy**]{.underline}. They do not probe what actually
are American interests in the region.12 [The challenge of world-power
China is regionwide. Numerous and large difficulties in the region are
caused by PRC assertiveness]{.underline}. These matters are made almost
invisible by the revisionist discourse that refers to the East Sea,
which also abuts Japan, and the South Sea, which abuts ASEAN nations, as
China\'s \"near seas,\" as if the other nations are not equally near or
nearer to what ambitious CCP territorial claims have put in dispute.
[The way to ask a question about Taipei, Beijing, and Washington to
reveal the interests at stake should be: Would ending U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan help the governments of the region achieve goals, such as
independent room for maneuver rather than domination by
China?]{.underline} These purposes are also in America\'s interest. Yet
[the revisionist contention that American policy should be premised on
the notion that China\'s rise is real and sustainable, and a challenge
to old U.S. policies in Asia, seems correct]{.underline}. Some policies
may no longer make sense. One should take seriously the consequences of
China\'s extraordinary rise. Close to its shores, according to the
analysis of Yoshihara and Holmes,13 China is already a peer competitor
with America. **[China]{.underline}** will become the world\'s largest
economy. It **[will build a military to match its economic
supremacy]{.underline}**. Such [new conditions do require new thinking.
The revisionists are correct that America should reexamine its China
policy in the light of the new realities]{.underline}. The revisionist
error is making Taiwan central to those new regional and global
realities. There is nothing the U.S. government can do to stop a rising
China concerned about its energy lifelines to the Middle East from
building a navy that will be dispatched to the Indian Ocean to protect
China\'s oil supplies and sea lanes to those energy resources. China is
a world power; it will build a military to serve what its ruling groups
understand as China\'s global interests. Given the challenges that lie
ahead, the revisionists are wise to insist that America should focus on
maintaining the peace. [China and America have to learn to live together
all around the world]{.underline}. The revisionist concern of avoiding
war hopefully will be a top priority of leaders both in Beijing and
Washington. The revisionist claim that preserving the peace may
necessitate a U.S. initiative that abandons previously privileged
policies is persuasive. But is it, as revisionists claim, an alleged
American provocation---its Tai-wan policy---that precludes
Beijing-Washington cooperation on all matters that could be war-prone?
On this question, the [revisionists]{.underline} are not persuasive.
They [misconstrue Chinese political dynamics and foreign policy
aims]{.underline}. [They claim that the increasingly repressive
single-party dictatorship in China of the late Hu Jintao era was somehow
moving \"toward rule of law\" and elections]{.underline}. In fact,
**[repression intensified]{.underline}**.\' Revisionists assume that the
CCP dictatorship is gradually evolving into a democracy that will then
lead on to peace. This is because, to people persuaded by the democratic
peace hypothesis, democracies do not fight other democracies.
[Engagement and patience]{.underline}, for the revisionists, [will
lead]{.underline}, eventually, [to democracy in China and then to peace,
once the Taiwan irritant is removed from Beijing-Washington
relations]{.underline}. Actually, **[since the CCP regime has ruthlessly
crushed any imagined domestic challenge to its hold on power, it does
not seem realistic to contend that U.S. policy in the region should be
premised on wishful thinking about an unknowable future]{.underline}**.
[A broad array of analysts in Europe]{.underline}, once committed to
unconditional engagement with China in the hopes that good relations
would facilitate its democratization, [now acknowledge that China is not
grad-ually evolving into a democracy]{.underline}. It is not an
unwillingness of the industrialized democracies to engage with China
that unleashes war-prone possibilities. **[It is not Taiwan\'s purchase
of defensive weapons that unleashes the forces of war]{.underline}**.
[**It is China\'s goal of Asian predominance**, a supposed return to
China\'s supposedly historical and nat-ural role, **which undermines
peaceful possibilities**]{.underline}. China\'s backing of a militarily
provocative North Korea and China\'s military assertiveness in waters
abutting Japan and ASEAN nations worry China\'s neighbors in Asia and
challenge the American interests that inform its Asian Theater Strategy.
[These clashes have **explosive potential**, **even if China\'s demands
on Taiwan were satisfied**]{.underline}. [No one]{.underline}, after
all, [claims that the regional assertiveness of the CCP regime is caused
by unhappiness over arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}. Rather, Chinese
leaders, as described by Chinese think tank analysts, imagine their
ambitious policies as returning China to its supposedly natural role as
the dominant power in the region. As a result, [the revisionist claim
that abandoning Taiwan to China is a realist lesser evil because it
guarantees peace in Asia is not persuasive]{.underline}. **[It ignores
China\'s policy goals in Asia and the expanding ambitions of a
world-power China]{.underline}**. The revisionist claim is that \"Taiwan
is a frequent point of contention with the Chinese because of
pluralistic domestic pressures \[in China\] particularly in respect to
arms sales and one that should be re-examined.\" More usefully, Robert
Suettinger\'s book Beyond Tiananmen details how [China\'s policy of
military pressure on Taiwan is the result of post-June 4 Chinese
politics]{.underline}. That is, military forces have become ever
weightier in Beijing since the 1989 crushing of a nationwide democracy
movement in which the military preserved the CCP\'s monopoly of
unaccountable power.\' The revisionists suggest that the U.S. government
should satisfy the \"wants\" of the CCP regime by stopping selling arms
to Taiwan: \"Strides forward in the U.S./China relationship can be
accelerated by a fresh look at solving the Taiwan issue.\" [**No
specifics** are offered on what China would give in return that would
enhance the likelihood of peace in the region]{.underline}. [Where would
China be more conciliatory? Wouldn\'t a U.S. accommodation of China\'s
demands on Taiwan rather make it more likely that others in the region,
especially governments seeking U.S. support to help preserve their
sovereignty, would deem Washington unreliable? **Wouldn\'t that
facilitate Beijing\'s regional hegemony?** How would such an outcome be
helpful to the goals of America\'s Grand Strategy?]{.underline} **[The
actual consequences of abandoning Taiwan would therefore be to advance
authoritarian China\'s regional domination to the detriment of virtually
all others in the region]{.underline}**, [an outcome that would not
advance American interests]{.underline}. Yet the revisionists, of
course, are realists. They worry about war because they find war-prone
forces in China. Reports out of China portray President Hu Jintao, who
left office at the end of 2012, as long being under attack as weak and
indecisive in Asia, even as China was becoming more expansionist and
assertive against its neighbors. This tendency grew, even though
China-Taiwan relations were tranquil. It does not bode well for China\'s
neighbors.\' It suggests that [the dangers of war in Asia are not
significantly related to Taiwan\'s arms purchases from
America]{.underline}. That is, [**there is no reason to believe the core
contention of the revisionists**: that ending arms sales to Taiwan will
preserve the peace]{.underline}. In 2008, the American financial crisis
and China\'s speedy economic recov-ery led Chinese leaders to conclude
that it was time to stand up for justice for China. Henceforth, \"China
did not need to suppress its ambitions.\"\" Since then [a major
destabilizer in the region has been the PRC\'s irredentist claims and
military assertiveness]{.underline}, which many analysts explain as a
response, in part, to Chinese energy insecurity. In the East Sea, which
includes Japan\'s Senkaku islets (called Diaoyu by the Chinese),
**[Beijing has been asserting itself militarily]{.underline}**, [which
very much worries the government in Tokyo]{.underline}. Similar Chi-nese
policy challenges in the South Sea work against many nations of ASEAN,
most prominently Vietnam and the Philippines. The [CCP regime has
clashed with the U.S. Navy in ways that suggest a Beijing policy goal of
forcing it out of the region]{.underline}. [Arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}, which is at the northern tip of the South Sea and
the southern tip of the East Sea, [should be assessed in the context of
the CCP regime\'s regional assertiveness]{.underline}. **[There is no
evidence that other governments in the region see the policy proposal of
the revisionists, incorporation of Taiwan into China, as being in their
own interest]{.underline}**. [Proponents of abandoning Taiwan, silent on
all these matters, assert that America should surrender to Chinese
hegemony to avoid war since Chinese hegemony supposedly is inevitable no
matter what the U.S. does]{.underline}. But [the future actually is
contingent on policy and leadership responses to unexpected
events]{.underline}. To be sure, there is a new situation brought on by
the rapid rise of China. That, indeed, cries out for new policy
thinking, but on China, not Taiwan. **[Realism requires that a new China
policy be comprehended in its Asian context]{.underline}**. The question
is not how an American administration should meet the needs of ruling
groups in Beijing. [What is required instead for America, if one takes
the goals of its Grand Strategy seriously, is to clarify American
interests in the entire Asia-Pacific region when confronted by the
challenges of a rapidly rising, world-power, authoritarian
China]{.underline}.

#### The aff reduces the chances of unification, empowers hardliners in both countries, and further poisons relations

political science at Davidson College and the author of Why Taiwan
Matters: Small Island, Global Powerhouse. 11-29-2011, \"Why giving up
Taiwan will not help us with China,\" AEI,

No Silver Bullet for US-China Woes Even if it were true that
Sino-American tensions could be melted away with a single policy change
in Washington, [the United States should still continue to support
Taiwan to **maintain the credibility of its alliances** and **uphold its
commitment to democracy** as a desirable and feasible goal for
developing nations]{.underline}. But, in reality, [ending US defense
assistance to Taipei is **unlikely to produce** the salutary effects the
critics of current US policy anticipate. Such a change
would]{.underline} indeed delight Beijing; however, it would [**create
new problems just as intractable** as the old ones but less familiar and
potentially even more challenging. The point of departure for
critics]{.underline} of America's existing Taiwan policy [is their
shared belief that ending security assistance to Taiwan would improve
US-China relations]{.underline}. As Freeman puts it, "The kind of
long-term relationship of friendship and cooperation China and America
want with each other is incompatible with our emotionally fraught
differences over the Taiwan issue. These differences propel mutual
hostility and the sort of ruinous military rivalry between the two
countries that has already begun. We are coming to a point at which we
can no longer finesse our differences over Taiwan. We must either
resolve them or live with the increasingly adverse consequences of our
failure to do so."\[10\] As a syllogism, this argument makes sense:
Beijing believes Taiwan should be unified with the mainland, and it
views US security assistance to Taiwan as the primary reason it is not.
Because unification is a core issue for the PRC, leaders in Beijing
cannot ignore or overlook US intervention; they must constantly
challenge it. Thus, if the United States ended its security assistance
to Taiwan, the biggest irritant in US-China relations would disappear.
[In practice, unfortunately, there is **no guarantee** that a change in
US policy toward Taiwan would instantly or automatically end, or even
significantly reduce, the tensions the Taiwan issue creates in
Sino-American relations. Ending security assistance to Taiwan would
**raise expectations in China without removing the existing obstacles to
peaceful unification.**]{.underline} It likely would provoke panic in
Taiwan, but [it would not make the Taiwanese people any more
enthusiastic about unification. On the contrary, the **more vulnerable
and threatened** the Taiwanese people felt, the harder it would be for
them to consider China's overtures rationally. For decades, the United
States has justified arms sales to Taiwan on the grounds that **Taipei
can negotiate with Beijing more effectively from a position of strength
than of weakness**]{.underline}. It is easy to dismiss this logic as a
rationalization, but as Randall Schriver said, "In what other instance
involving a negotiation is the weaker party better off? . . .
Historically, what you find is [where there is equal power---or, at
least, credible deterrent power---you get better outcomes]{.underline}."
[Neither Beijing nor Taipei is well served by a negotiating process that
leads to a bad deal, including one Taiwanese citizens cannot
accept]{.underline}. Successfully pressuring Taiwan's negotiators into
accepting a deal might seem like a victory for Beijing, but [if
**Taiwan's domestic politics make it impossible to implement the deal**,
the long-term result might be worse than no deal at all. Ending US
defense assistance to Taiwan]{.underline}---whether by repealing the
Taiwan Relations Act or by simply declining to provide defensive
equipment to Taiwan's armed forces---[would not "ripen" Taiwan for
peaceful unification or obviate the rationale the United States has
historically followed regarding Taiwan. It would, however, **intensify
the debate** over Taiwan policy within the United States. Taiwan still
has many US friends and supporters]{.underline}, and many foreign policy
experts would question a decision to change course. [The policy changes
Gilley, Glaser, Freeman, and Owens recommend would stimulate a debate
over China policy at a time when negative attitudes toward the PRC
already are on the rise. The last thing Sino-American relations need is
an **acrimonious, politically charged debate in Washington** over policy
toward China and Taiwan]{.underline}. In sum, [changing America's Taiwan
policy could easily induce a poisonous turn in the domestic politics of
US China policy without making peaceful unification easier.]{.underline}
A change in US Taiwan policy would challenge China in yet another way.
[Although Chinese leaders no doubt are genuinely furious]{.underline}
about what they see as US interference in China's domestic affairs, [US
security assistance to Taiwan actually reinforces their current policy
direction]{.underline}. In recent years, [Beijing has insisted domestic
economic and social development must come first; risky and expensive
undertakings]{.underline}, however attractive, [cannot be allowed to
undermine that goal. As long as Taiwan does not lunge for formal
independence, unification can wait. US security
assistance]{.underline}---both the possibility of direct intervention
and support for Taiwan's self-defense---[**makes unification risky and
expensive**. If the United States withdraws its support, we should
expect **nationalists and hardliners in the PRC** to press the
C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty
[leadership to solve the Taiwan problem sooner rather than
later]{.underline}. China's newly muscular posture in the East and South
China Seas is already raising eyebrows around the region; **[the last
thing Beijing needs is a reinvigorated nationalist movement howling for
satisfaction on another offshore issue]{.underline}**. Although we can
hardly expect them to admit it, [the status quo in the Taiwan Strait
serves the political interests of Chinese leaders whose top priority is
domestic development and regime stability.]{.underline} Indeed, even the
best-case scenario for Beijing is unpredictable and potentially
destabilizing. We can say Gilley is right, and Taiwan is moving toward
Finlandization. In fact, [there is ample evidence for a consensus within
Taiwan that deeper engagement with mainland China is both inevitable and
desirable. At the same time]{.underline}, however, [**the Taiwanese
people are more attached than ever to their political autonomy and
distinctive identity. Withdrawing US security assistance would not
change these attitudes**, but many Taiwanese people would view this
action, rightly or wrongly, as a **deathblow** to the island's autonomy.
Some would try to flee. Others would urge their government to **develop
doomsday weapons to keep the PRC at bay**, a desperate measure the
United States has so far dissuaded Taiwan from pursuing. Others still
would **encourage Taipei to hold out as long as possible**. The economic
costs]{.underline} of undermining the Taiwanese people's confidence in
their own security [would be huge, and negotiating a peaceful, mutually
acceptable unification in such an environment would be nearly
impossible]{.underline}. To finish the job, [China would almost
certainly be forced to resort to coercive
measures]{.underline}---precisely the expensive and risky undertaking
Chinese leaders are hoping to avoid. And even if its coercive measures
succeeded in winning the Taiwan government's acquiescence, [integrating
23 million sullen and terrified Taiwanese into the PRC would be yet
another daunting and expensive project.]{.underline} US security
assistance stabilizes both sides of the Taiwan Strait by reassuring the
Taiwanese people and justifying Beijing's decision to be patient. Should
the United States Oppose Peaceful Unification? [Arguments like these
often are misread as justifications for containment]{.underline},
attempts to use Taiwan to prevent China from increasing its national
power and status. In reality, although some advocates of containment do
include Taiwan in their strategic thinking, [a policy that supports
Taipei's efforts to craft a relationship with the PRC that serves both
sides' interests is not anti-China.]{.underline} Since Richard Nixon's
first visit to China in 1972, the United States has been steadfastly
agnostic on the question of unification. Nixon said, "We will support
any peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue that can be worked
out."\[11\] [Nor does the current US policy militate against China's
long-term goal of unification. The United States]{.underline} has never
taken a position as to how the cross-strait relationship ultimately
should be resolved. Instead, it [holds that any outcome is acceptable,
so long as the two sides arrive at it through a peaceful, mutual, and
noncoercive process]{.underline}. Washington has made clear that Beijing
should not bully Taiwan and Taiwan should not provoke or insult the PRC.
During the administration of Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian, US
officials forcefully reminded the country's leaders to respect Beijing's
bottom lines and avoid gratuitous offense or unilateral action. When
cross-strait tensions eased under President Ma Ying-jeou, US officials
were quick to express encouragement for the warming trend. Although the
United States has an interest in seeing Taiwan's future decided
peacefully and democratically, it does not want to block Taiwan from
forging a permanent peace---or even unifying---with mainland China.
Today, [few in Taiwan believe Beijing is prepared to offer a unification
proposal that would preserve their democratic system, but if it were to
offer such a deal in the future, they might well support
it]{.underline}. And if they did, [nothing in such an arrangement would
be inconsistent with the interests of other nations, including the
United States, assuming the PRC did not use Taiwan's territory as a base
for expanding its military reach in the western Pacific.]{.underline}

### Links: Accomodation Fails

#### Accommodation fails -- causes Taiwan and China to overreact and increases the risk of war

**Paal 11** (Douglas Paal is Vice President for Studies at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. "Disengaging from Taiwan; Should
Washington Continue Its Alliance With Taipei?: Accommodation Will Not
Work," Foreign Affairs, July/August 2011,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-asia/2011-07-01/disengaging-taiwan>)SEM

[The unstated premise of Charles Glaser\'s recommendation of
\"accommodation\" to China over Taiwan]{.underline} (\"Will China\'s
Rise Lead to War?\" March/April 2011) [is that the people of Taiwan
would have no say]{.underline} in this decision. From the early years of
the United States\' relationship with the People\'s Republic of China,
U.S. presidents have wrestled with strong domestic political support for
continued good relations with Taiwan, whatever new arrangements might be
reached with Beijing. Over eight successive presidential
administrations, this support has morphed from an implicit to an
explicit tenet of U.S policy: the outcome between China and Taiwan must
be decided with the assent of the Taiwanese people. [Glaser would do
well to explain how Taiwanese public opinion would factor into his
recommendation. What if an administration took his advice and the people
of Taiwan rejected it? Can a **desperate bolt for de jure independence**
be ruled out? Could China\'s leaders restrain themselves from rushing to
**grab the spoils to satisfy nationalist opinion** and Beijing\'s
long-standing claims on Taiwan? Would any of these outcomes bring about
the stability in U.S.-Chinese relations that Glaser seeks? The outlook
is **doubtful** and likely to **produce more tensions** than reduce
existing ones.]{.underline} There is a reason that eight U.S.
administrations have embraced [the same policy toward China and
Taiwan]{.underline}, and that is because it [serves U.S. interests in
peace, prosperity, and stability]{.underline}. U.S. **[arms sales to
Taiwan are an important part of maintaining peace in the western
Pacific]{.underline}**. Despite a gradual easing of tensions between
China and Taiwan, [Beijing continues to enhance its military
capabilities]{.underline} with regard to Taipei. This has developed a
vicious cycle. By choosing to increase the military offensive capability
deployed opposite Taiwan, [Beijing compels Taiwan\'s leadership to seek
outside sources of support and arms to deter Chinese aggression. If
Taiwan\'s leaders failed to find that support, their voters would remove
them]{.underline}. Only the United States has the will to fulfill
Taiwan\'s request, compelling any U.S. administration to respond or
suffer politically at home. This, in turn, compels Beijing to react
strongly to what it considers interference in its internal affairs,
since it claims Taiwan as part of China. [If the cycle is to be broken,
it needs to start with the mainland's choice to increase or decrease its
military deployments, not with Washington conceding Taiwan to
Beijing.]{.underline}

Much Ado about Nothing? [Critics of existing US Taiwan policy resist the
characterization that they advocate "abandoning" Taiwan.]{.underline}
All of the individuals cited in this article made clear that Taiwan's
democracy is valuable and should be encouraged. As Admiral Owens put it,
"We must always protect the democracy and freedoms Taiwan has developed,
but weapons sales do not do this."\[12\] [**But how can the United
States protect and encourage Taiwan's democracy while cutting off
security assistance**? The critics square this circle with a key
assumption: the PRC has no desire to dismantle Taiwan's democratic
system]{.underline} or restrict the Taiwanese people's freedom, so the
whole enterprise of Taiwan "holding out" against the PRC is much ado
about nothing. [Unfortunately, the evidence to support this assumption
is scant.]{.underline} Chas [Freeman argues unification is
compatible]{.underline} with Taiwan's democracy because the PRC
leadership says so: "American priorities look all the more inverted when
one considers that Beijing has offered to negotiate what amounts to
purely symbolic reunification with Taiwan, [forgoing any political or
military presence]{.underline} of its own on the island. This offer
cannot be dismissed as incredible."\[13\] He offers Hong Kong and Macau
as proof of Beijing's "willingness to tolerate amazingly different
politico-economic orders on what is nominally its territory."\[14\]
Readers will have their own views of how well Hong Kong is faring
fifteen years into its fifty years of promised autonomy, but [it is not
hard to fathom why many in Taiwan are **skeptical about China's
offer**]{.underline}. To give just one example, the PRC has trotted out
various formulations of its "One China Principle" in conversations with
Taiwanese officials, some of them quite generous, implying that Taiwan
and the mainland are both parts of a China that is not defined by either
state. In the international arena, however, [the One China
Principle]{.underline} has not changed. It [states there is only one
China in the world, Taiwan is part of China, and the sole legal
government and international representative of China is the People's
Republic]{.underline}. A key PRC policy document, "The One-China
Principle and the Taiwan Issue," confirms, "the government of the PRC
naturally should fully enjoy and exercise China's sovereignty, including
its sovereignty over Taiwan."\[15\] [How can Taiwan agree to the One
China Principle when the definitions are so slippery? Gilley offers a
different rationale]{.underline} for why Taiwan need not fear the PRC.
[Americans, he argues, fundamentally misunderstand China's domestic
politics when they believe "that Beijing is motivated by
nationalism]{.underline} and that the PRC's irredentist claims to Taiwan
stem from a broader national discourse of humiliation and weakness . . .
\[and that it is\] striving to reincorporate Taiwan into China in order
to avert a domestic nationalist backlash and a crisis of
legitimacy."\[16\] [Gilley dismisses this interpretation. He says
Chinese leaders have long since relinquished an ideologically charged
view of Taiwan]{.underline} and that today "both sides have embraced a
view of security that is premised on high-level contact, trust, and
reduced threats of force."\[17\] [The real driver of China's policy,
says Gilley, is geostrategic. Beijing]{.underline} wants to dominate its
offshore regions, and it [wants to ensure that Taiwan cannot "serve as a
base for foreign military operations against China]{.underline} \[or\] .
. . constrain Beijing's ability to develop and project naval power and
ensure maritime security in East Asia." Taiwan is a problem for Beijing
in this regard only if it is aligned with the United States. A
Finlandized Taiwan poses no threat, since China's concern is "with
Taiwan's geostrategic status, not with the precise nature of its
political ties to China."\[18\] Therefore, unification (or Gilley's idea
of Finlandization) need not impinge on Taiwan's domestic autonomy at
all. In the near term, meanwhile, Gilley says that dropping arms sales
might cause China to scale back military preparations aimed at Taiwan.
[The problem with these arguments is that they are based on an
analytical judgment that **cannot be proven**]{.underline}. Certainly it
makes sense today that Beijing would not want to kill the goose that
lays the golden eggs by blowing up the underpinnings of Taiwan's
success, nor does it have any interest in scaring its other neighbors,
many of which are already on edge. But how long will this logic prevail?
[After Finlandization, what happens if Chinese nationalists flood the
streets of Beijing demanding "real" unification?]{.underline} What
happens if a crowd starts singing Taiwan's national anthem during a
joint appearance of the PRC president and his Taiwanese counterpart?
[Will "autonomy" require limiting what Taiwanese citizens say and
publish? Once China "fully enjoys and exercises its sovereignty over
Taiwan," as the PRC white paper put it, what steps can other nations
take to defend Taiwan's democracy? With **so many questions still
open**, it is not hard to see why so few in Taiwan are ready to take
Beijing's promises at face value.]{.underline} Taiwan's ability to have
its independence recognized internationally is nil and growing niller
every day, but [China's ability to force its will on Taiwan is strong
and growing stronger]{.underline}. In other words, [the issue motivating
Beijing's deterrence policy is already moot, but the factor driving
Taiwan's arms purchases is anything but. China's arms buildup continues
unabated, and its campaign to isolate Taiwan internationally has
diminished only marginally. In this context, asking a weak Taiwan to
surrender its self-defense capabilities on faith that China will play
nicely seems the very definition of "oddly misguided" thinking. Gilley,
Glaser, Freeman, and Owens believe arms sales are the driver for China's
military buildup opposite Taiwan. **But that buildup has continued
uninterrupted through periods of arms sales and periods when arms sales
were suspended**; it continued under Sinophobic Taiwanese presidents and
is continuing now under the most proengagement president Taiwan has ever
seen]{.underline}. [The evidence suggests **China's military posture has
its own logic**, which in turn suggests that a change in **US policy
would do little to alter it.**]{.underline} Foreign Affairs published
several letters criticizing the [Gilley and Glaser]{.underline}
articles, especially the two authors' sanguine view of China's military
deployments. Both authors published rejoinders to their critics in which
they made critical concessions. In Gilley's words, "If China were to
reduce its threat to Taiwan by promising verifiable and immediate force
reductions, as well as by allowing Taipei to continually expand its role
in international organizations, Taiwan may decide that participating in
U.S. military planning, purchasing major weapons systems from the United
States, and denying offshore naval security to China are no longer worth
it. However, an implicit U.S. promise to intervene in the event of any
invasion of Taiwan would be necessary in order for Taipei to choose to
change course" (emphasis added).\[19\] Glaser made a similar concession,
writing, "The United States could stop selling arms to Taiwan but
maintain its pledge to defend Taiwan should China launch an unprovoked
attack; it could continue to sell Taiwan arms but make clear that it
will not intervene on Taiwan's behalf should a conflict occur, even if
Taiwan did not provoke it; or it could link its continued support to the
Taiwanese government's willingness to refrain from moving toward
independence."\[20\] Both authors, in other words, [admitted that **some
kind of US security guarantee was necessary for Taiwan**: in exchange
for ending arms sales, the United States would need to make
a]{.underline}n implicit (or explicit) "[promise to
intervene]{.underline}." Three serious problems with this line of
argument exist. First, [in the absence of arms sales, a promise to
intervene **might not be credible**]{.underline}. Could the United
States mount a successful defense of Taiwan if the island had been
disarmed? Second, [such a policy invites envelope pushing on both sides
of the strait]{.underline}. America's decades-old policy of [**strategic
ambiguity** is based on the idea that keeping the two sides
guessing]{.underline} about how the United States will react in a crisis
[restrains Taiwan's tendency toward recklessness and Beijing's tendency
toward aggression. Gilley and Glaser are recommending the United States
ditch that policy.]{.underline} Finally, [trading arms sales for a
promise of intervention would **completely undermine** the thrust of
Gilley and Glaser's original articles. On what basis can we conclude
that such a policy would be **any less offensive** to China than
America's current policy?]{.underline} Indeed, [Beijing would probably
find the promise of **direct military intervention even more of an
intrusion into China's domestic affairs than arms sales**]{.underline}.
[And surely such a change]{.underline} in US policy [would only
accelerate]{.underline} the development Freeman is most concerned about,
[an expensive and destabilizing race for military dominance between the
United States and the PRC.]{.underline}

Using the occasion of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore this month,
Chinese Minister of National Defense and State Councilor Gen.
[[Wei]{.underline}]{.mark} Fenghe, [[delivered a sharp message]{.mark}
to the United States, **[which may be termed the "Xi Doctrine"]{.mark}**
on China's use of force, after Chinese premier Xi]{.underline} Jinping.
[Wei declaring both China's resolve to aggress to advance its interests
and a rationalization for the use of force]{.underline}. [Wei's **de
facto threat of war** should not be lost in his nuances, deliberate
ambiguity, or in translation]{.underline}. [His remarks were so
bellicose that the world has noticed, as was certainly intended by the
leadership of the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party
([CCP]{.underline}). [[Empirical evidence of China's aggression is
increasingly common, from]{.mark} its attempt to dominate [the South
China]{.mark} Sea, the neo-imperialist effort to gain control of states
through [the Belt and Road Initiative]{.mark}, to its [technological
imperialism to control 5G and artificial intelligence
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}. What is rather less frequent are
[statements from high-level Chinese officials proclaiming the country's
intent to be aggressive and offering an attempted legitimizing principle
justifying that aggression]{.underline}. While much of the content of
Wei's remarks were in keeping with the gossamer pronouncements on
China's peaceful intentions, as well as a paean to Xi Jinping's
leadership, **[[they still conveyed that China is ready and willing to
resort to war]{.underline}]{.mark}** if the United States stands in its
way of global expansion; and they made clear that China must go to war,
or even a nuclear war, to occupy Taiwan. Specifically, [there are four
elements that comprise the Xi Doctrine and are indications of China's
signaling its willingness to use force]{.underline}. The first component
is a new and alarming proclamation of the undisguised threats to use
force or wage an unlimited war. [China is becoming bolder as its
military power grows]{.underline}. This is evidenced in Wei's muscular
remarks on the People's Republic of China's approach against Taiwan, his
explicit statement that China does not renounce the use of force against
Taiwan, and his effort to deter the United States and its allies from
intervention should an attack occur. Wei forcefully stated: "[If anyone
dares to separate Taiwan from China, the Chinese military has no choice
but must go to war, and **must fight** for the reunification of the
motherland **at all costs**]{.underline}." "At all cost" means that
[[China will not hesitate to use nuclear weapons or **launching another
Pearl Harbor**]{.underline}]{.mark} to take over Taiwan. This is a clear
warning of an invasion. Second, [[the Xi Doctrine legitimizes
territorial expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}. Through his remarks, [Wei
sought to convince the rest of the world that China's seizure of most of
the South China Sea is an accomplished fact that cannot be
overturned]{.underline}. He made bogus accusations, which included
blaming the United States for "raking in profits by stirring up
troubles" in the region. [He insisted that only ASEAN and China must
resolve the issue]{.underline}. He claimed that [China's militarization
on South China Sea islands and reefs were an act of
self-defense]{.underline}. Should this be allowed to stand, then **[[the
Xi Doctrine will set a perilous precedent of successful territorial
expansion, which will further entice China and jeopardize the peace of
the region]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Third, **[[the doctrine]{.mark}
targets the United States as a cause of the world's major problems and
[envisions a powerful China evicting the United States from the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Wei obliquely identified the United
States as the cause wars, conflicts, and unrest, and sought to convey
that the United States will abandon the states of the South China Sea
(SCS) when it is confronted by Chinese power, a typical divide and
conquer strategy used by the CCP regime. [The Xi Doctrine's fourth
element is the mendacity regarding China's historical use of force and
current actions]{.underline}. While the distortions of history were
numerous, there were three major lies that should be alarming for the
states of the region and the global community. First, [Wei said that
China had never invaded another country, which is a claim so
transparently false it can only be a measure of the contempt he held for
the audience]{.underline}. [China has a long history of
aggression]{.underline}, including against the Tibetans and Vietnamese,
and perhaps soon against the Taiwanese. Second, Wei argued that hegemony
does not conform to China's values when, in fact, [China proudly was
Asia's hegemon for most of the last two thousand years]{.underline}.
Lastly, he claimed that the situation in the SCS is moving toward
stability---from China's perspective this stability is caused by its
successful seizure of territory. In fact, [the SCS is far less stable as
a result of China's actions. Efforts to counter this grab are denounced
by Wei as destabilizing, which is a bit like a thief accusing you of a
crime for wanting your property returned]{.underline}. Wei's belligerent
rhetoric is an indication that the CCP regime faces deep external and
internal crises. Externally, [the Trump administration]{.underline} has
shocked the CCP with the three major steps it has taken. First, it [has
shifted the focus of the U.S. national-security strategy and now
identifies China explicitly as its primary rival---abandoning the far
more muted policies of previous administrations]{.underline}. Second,
Trump has acted on this peer competitive threat by advancing tangible
measures, such as arms sales to allies and the ban of Huawei. Third,
[the [administration has made credible commitments to]{.mark} assure
partners and allies **to [counter China's aggression and
bullying]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These have unbalanced the CCP regime,
and its natural reaction is to bully its way out. Additionally, [the CCP
regime has perceived that [the world today has begun to consider **the
negative implications of China's rise**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the
United States is determined to prevent what heretofore had been
considered China's unstoppable rise. From the perspective of CCP,
conflict is increasingly seen as inevitable and perhaps even imminent.
[Wei's bellicosity should be seen in this light, and the PLA is tasked
with fighting and winning the war]{.underline}. Internally, Xi's
anti-corruption campaign that selectively targets his political
rivalries, and his abandoning the established rules such as term limited
of presidency, have introduced deep cleavages into the unity of the
regime unity. China's economic slowdown, made worse by the U.S. trade
war, is a fundamental challenge to the regime's legitimacy. Xi's
repression and suppression of the Chinese people, particularly
human-rights defenders, Christians, Kazakhs, Uighurs, and other
minorities, have miscarried. Drawing from the pages of unfortunate
history, in a classic social-imperialist move, [the regime wants to
direct these internal tensions outward]{.underline}. At the same time,
the nationalistic fervor advanced by the CCP's propaganda and by the
rapid military modernization have made many young militant officers in
the PLA overconfident. This is infrequently noticed in the West. [They
can hardly wait to fight an ultimate war to defeat the
arch-enemy]{.underline}. [This plainly dangerous mentality **echoes the
Japanese military's beliefs before Pearl Harbor**]{.underline}. The
bellicosity evinced in Wei's speech is serious and is not bluster
intended to deter. [The United States cannot meet China's threat with
half-measures, which are likely to further encourage China's aggressive
behavior]{.underline}. **[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must

adamantine [determination, and more vigorous diplomatic and military
measures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With the Xi Doctrine, [[China has

### Internals: Taiwan Key 

#### Taiwan is key to containing Chinese [political influence]{.underline}

**Whiton 19** (Christian Whiton was a State Department deputy special
envoy from 2003 to 2009. He serves as a senior fellow at the Center for
the National Interest and the author of [Smart Power: Between Diplomacy
and War](https://amzn.to/2q7U6Qq), 6-4-2019, \"Why Taiwan Is America\'s
Best Asset Against China,\" National
Interest, <https://nationalinterest.org/feature/why-taiwan-americas-best-asset-against-china-61062>)SEM

Notwithstanding Washington drama and parlor games, the biggest story of
the decade is that America's response to China's economic and military
aggression has changed dramatically. With bipartisan support in
Congress, President Donald [Trump has moved forcefully to toughen allied
solidarity in the Pacific and to resist Chinese economic warfare. But
Washington has overlooked]{.underline} one key asset in this
fight---[Taiwan---and often instead mistook it for a
liability]{.underline}. This distinction is fundamentally important as
we ponder the durability of the Chinese Communist Party amid an economic
slowdown and as the world marks the thirtieth anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square Massacre this week. The island [nation]{.underline} of
twenty-four million free people is [frequently threatened by China with
reunification---a euphemism for military invasion and
conquest]{.underline}, and an end to the de facto political independence
that Taiwan has enjoyed since 1949. The United States doesn't have a
mutual defense treaty with Taiwan, but it is bound by a 1979 law to sell
it the arms it needs for its defense---a standard previous U.S.
administrations have usually failed to meet. Previous U.S. messaging has
also been dubious. For example, in 2004, Secretary of State Colin Powell
went to Beijing and asserted that Taiwan wasn't a sovereign nation.
Additionally, Powell said the United States sought the "peaceful
reunification" of Taiwan and China. In other words, leave your freedom
at the door. Armchair experts who have skimmed the Wikipedia entry on
Chinese culture observe that [Beijing's rulers cannot afford to "lose
face," which would occur if Taiwan were to declare independence
formally]{.underline}. Fair enough, but [this sentiment is frequently
extended radically to areas where Taiwan is left unable to secure its
national interests. Every year, China enhances its offensive military
posture against Taiwan]{.underline}. Beijing also picks off more of the
handful of remaining minor nations that have formal relations with
Taiwan instead of China. This is important to note because official
foreign relations are necessary for Taiwanese leaders to visit America
(seldom Washington, DC) under the artifice of a "transit stop" on their
way to state visits elsewhere. Moreover, [China prevents Taiwan from
entering multilateral forums like the World Health Organization, and
Taiwan's status as something other than a real country often prevents it
from securing trade deals with other nations or economic blocs like the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations]{.underline}. On top of that,
experts dismiss Taiwan's protestations and efforts to rectify these
problems as dangerously provocative toward China. Past U.S.
[presidents]{.underline} of both parties [have effectively
adopted]{.underline} what Bill Clinton's top Asia policy official called
"[strategic ambiguity]{.underline}." When Chinese officials asked Joseph
Nye what the United States would do if they attacked Taiwan, he said,
"We don't know and you don't know. It would depend on the
circumstances." An endless academic debate over whether to make formal
our implicit likelihood to come to Taiwan's defense---and whether this
would increase or decrease the chances of peace or create a moral
hazard---has led nowhere. It's time to change the premise of the debate.
Even without formally dispensing with the fiction of our forty-year-old
"One-China Policy," which supposes there is only one China and that
Taiwan is a part of it, [American policymakers can take a very different
view of Taiwan that serves U.S. interests.]{.underline} Most
fundamentally, [Washington should see Taiwan as a free society that puts
the lie to the Chinese Communist Party's ultimate claim of
legitimacy]{.underline}. Throughout its seventy years of rule, [the
Party has justified its totalitarianism on the basis that any other form
of government would lead to chaos and corruption]{.underline}---features
that marked much of China's history and which some historians blame for
why greatness and global power have eluded the world's most populous
nation. [Taiwan is a living rebuke of this fiction]{.underline}. It
shows that an ethnically Chinese-majority country can achieve stability
and prosperity through democracy and the rule of law. Since Taiwan
evolved into a full democracy in 1996, it has had three peaceful changes
of power between political parties and its per capita income has grown
to more than \$50,000---now ranked twenty-eighth in the world.
Furthermore, Taipei has achieved this despite persistent threats and
intimidation from Beijing. Also, [Taiwan elected the first woman head of
state in Asia]{.underline} who was not the relative or spouse of a
previous president. [It has grown from an impoverished low-tech
manufacturing center to a diversified economy and creative
society.]{.underline} Last month it became the first Asian country to
legalize gay marriage, and unlike the United States, did so through a
vote of its national legislature. [Taiwan also protects the rights of
ethnic and religious minorities]{.underline}, whereas China may have as
many as three million Muslims in political reeducation camps at the
present time. [Democratization has allowed Taiwanese to develop a
pro-Taiwan identity that no longer rests on a thin, race-based notion of
ethnicity]{.underline}. In addition, like most democracies, [Taiwan
seeks peace with its neighbors]{.underline}. Every time that Chinese
officials rationalize or justify the subservience of law to the whims of
the Party, every time they lock someone up for having the wrong views or
worshipping the wrong God, every time they run over protesters with
tanks in the name of social harmony, every time they threaten their
neighbors with military force, [Taiwan stands as an example of a
different and better way for ethnically Chinese citizens to govern
themselves.]{.underline} In the free world's long competition with
China's government, [America should put Taiwan in the spotlight, **not
treat it like a liability**]{.underline}. It represents the future
everyone should want for China---a future that would be marked by
collaboration rather than confrontation with America and the rest of the
free world. For starters, [Washington should put an end to infantile
diplomatic insults to Taiwan]{.underline}, like prohibiting Taiwanese
exchange cadets at U.S. service academies from wearing their uniforms,
and not allowing Taiwanese diplomats to come to important meetings at
the White House, State Department, and Pentagon. America should call its
respective embassies and ambassadors what they are instead of the
stepchild legation known as the "American Institute in Taiwan," and get
rid of its useless domestic outpost in Arlington, Virginia. Consider the
advanced talks Washington has held with Iran and North Korea---countries
with which America does not have formal diplomatic relations. Surely the
United States can afford the same courtesy to a democratic friend.
[Policymakers should also implement congressional legislation that calls
for exchanges of senior members of each country's
government]{.underline}, including military flag officers. The forced
estrangement of the U.S. and Taiwanese militaries is dangerous and
leaves an obvious force-multiplier against Beijing gathering dust on a
shelf---what is needed is a joint command like the ones America has with
Japan and South Korea. Finally, [Washington should negotiate a formal
trade agreement with Taiwan]{.underline}. This too can be a model for
China, considering it could include all of the intellectual property
protections and other provisions to which Beijing has balked at
agreeing. [None of this amounts to a "regime change" policy toward China
per se. But it would reprise the nonviolent cultural
warfare]{.underline} America waged against the Soviet Union even as
Washington negotiated at times with Moscow during the Cold War.
[Spotlighting the **benefits of an alternative to your opponent's
political system can be smart statecraft**. In America's long contest
with China's government, Washington should do so whenever
practicable.]{.underline}

### China Revisionist/Contain key

#### China is revisionist -- military modernization, government model, and aggression toward Taiwan prove -- containment is key

Continue Its Alliance With Taipei?: Misreading China's Intentions,"
Foreign Affairs, July/August 2011,
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/east-asia/2011-07-01/disengaging-taiwan>)SEM

[According to Charles Glaser, the prospects for avoiding war between the
United States and China are good]{.underline} (\"Will China\'s Rise Lead
to War?\" March/April 2011). [But by **ignoring China\'s history and
economic policy** and other relevant factors, Glaser arrives at policy
prescriptions that would increase the chance of a Chinese nuclear
attack]{.underline} on the U.S. homeland. Glaser misjudges Chinese
motives. [China\'s military modernization is not primarily motivated by
insecurity]{.underline}, as he asserts. China is not threatened by the
United States or any of its neighbors. [It is advocating its model of
governance--- **managed capitalism combined with one party
authoritarianism**---as a more efficient alternative]{.underline} to a
free-market economy and democracy. [China\'s mission is to **regain its
place as the dominant superpower** so that the country can cleanse
itself of the humiliation]{.underline} it has experienced at the hands
of the West. The rise of China poses grave challenges to U.S. security.
[Beijing implements a mercantilist trade policy]{.underline} and
artificially sets a low value on its currency to promote exports, thus
[creating a large U.S. trade deficit]{.underline} with China year after
year. [Its **army has been modernizing** at a rapid pace, developing
anti-access, area-denial weapons and cyber- and space-warfare
capabilities]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [China wants to integrate Taiwan
because its democracy threatens Beijing\'s autocratic and repressive
rule]{.underline}. In addition, [Beijing needs Taiwan as a military base
from which to project power]{.underline} into the Indian and Pacific
oceans. To keep the peace, [the United States must]{.underline} discard
the culture of excessive deference to Beijing and [implement policies to
maintain U.S. military superiority]{.underline}, stanch the flow of U.S.
wealth to China, steer China toward democratization, [strengthen its
alliances with Japan and South Korea]{.underline}, and engage China in
an economic and strategic dialogue to promote fair trade and avoid
misunderstandings. To prevent a crisis from escalating to nuclear war,
Glaser says that the United States should back away from its commitment
to Taiwan. Such accommodation, he argues, would smooth the way for
better relations with China in the decades to come. Yet [if Taiwan were
to fall, the United States would suffer a **geostrategic** **disaster**.
The sea-lanes and airspace around Taiwan are **critical to the survival
of Japan and South Korea**. Once in control of Taiwan, China could turn
Japan and South Korea into vassal states]{.underline}. With the demise
of the U.S.-Japanese military alliance, the United States would be
forced to retreat to Hawaii. To avoid that fate, Washington must
reiterate that the future of Taiwan must be resolved peacefully and with
the assent of the Taiwanese people. [It must deploy sufficient naval and
air forces]{.underline} in the west ern Pacific [to deter Chinese
aggression]{.underline}, initiate high-level military exchanges with
Taiwan to facilitate joint military planning, [and speed up the sale to
Taiwan of F-16 fighters and other weapons]{.underline} that would be
useful in resisting a Chinese invasion.

## Domestic Mod DA

### Subs DA

#### Domestic submarine deployment necessarily results in [PLAN confrontations]{.underline} -- That escalates to [surprise strikes, staged accidents, espionage, and cyber-attacks]{.underline}

<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-new-submarines-alone-wont-save-taiwan-china-57992>)

\*PLAN = People's Liberation Army Navy

**[After its long request for additional submarines, Taiwan
has]{.underline}** somehow **[progressed towards its
goal]{.underline}**. On May 9, **[the]{.underline}** groundbreaking
ceremony of the **[shipyard for building submarines]{.underline}** in
Kaohsiung **[represented a milestone for Taiwan's indigenous
project]{.underline}**. After the fleet is completed, the asymmetrical
nature of the submarines vis-à-vis the Chinese major surface naval ships
would strengthen Taipei's deterrence against Beijing. The underwater
environment also makes the fleet generally free from air cover. In the
face of the advancing firepower of missiles and other projectiles from
the People's Liberation Army (PLA), Taiwan's air bases could be
vulnerable, as the quantitatively superior combat aircraft of the PLA
Air Force (PLAAF) and PLA Navy (PLAN) would seriously challenge Taiwan's
air defenses as well. In case that the PLA really dominated the sky
above the island and even sent airborne some units to the island, the
eventual shipping massive force across the Strait is still
indispensable. In this scenario, a few submarines could significantly
disrupt, if not deny, the PLAN amphibious fleet from projecting troops
onshore, thus causing considerable uncertainty for Beijing's gambit.
Apart from surface vessels, sub-launched cruise missiles would further
amplify the strategic values of the submarines beyond the maritime
domain, meaning more costs for China regarding use of force. **[Between
this terrific picture of deterrence and the reality]{.underline}**,
**[shipbuilding is a major obstacle, but]{.underline}** the
**[deployment]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** **[submarines
could]{.underline}** also **[be grave]{.underline}**. **[Due
to]{.underline}** the **[lack of public information]{.underline}**, such
as whether the design is really from scratch or based on a matured
model, **[it would not be realistic to estimate the feasibility of
the]{.underline}** relatively **[short schedule]{.underline}**; the
first boat is planned to be launched in 2024, commissioned in another
two years, followed by seven or more vessels. **[No matter how soon or
how many]{.underline}** of those **[submarines will be commissioned,
their movement from their bases to tactical and operational locations is
not only critical but also perilous.]{.underline}** **[For most
countries with]{.underline}** certain **[strategic depth from their
potential enemies, sailing submarines out of home bases would be plainly
simple, but Taiwan resides in the PLAN's operational
sphere]{.underline}**, **[and the Chinese may not take]{.underline}**
such a **[deployment for granted]{.underline}**. If Taipei will not
build new submarine bases, **[the current]{.underline}** Zuoying
**[naval base]{.underline}** facing the Taiwan Strait **[could be
directly attacked from Chinese ballistic and cruise
missiles]{.underline}**, as well as other munitions. Furthermore,
**[since the Zuoying base is close to the Kaohsiung Port, a hub
of]{.underline}** sea lines of communication (**[SLOCs]{.underline}**),
numerous **[merchants passing nearby the base could present a means for
the PLAN to take irregular operations.]{.underline}** For instance,
**[the]{.underline}** covered **[PLAN personnel could create one or more
"accidents" of sinking one or more ships into the underwater routes or
use cargo ships as platforms of launching surprise strikes from missiles
hidden in containers]{.underline}** or other coverages, **[leaving less
time for Zuoying to respond]{.underline}**. To build one or more
submarine bases in the East Coast of Taiwan would be better for less
exposure and dispersing naval assets, in addition to close access to the
deep Pacific Ocean, but such bases would not be trouble-free either. The
deep water may also allow the PLAN to deploy one or a few submarines as
"gatekeepers" to monitor the bases, and then follow any departing
Taiwanese counterparts. According to the planned fleet size, and ratios
of submarines in maintenance, training and duty, a maximal number of
Taiwan's submarines ready for operation could be six or seven, and it is
not impossible for the PLAN to carry out this gatekeeping tactic.
Moreover, [**Beijing's espionage may pave ways for several irregular
measures of neutralizing Taipei's submarine capability, such as
cyber-attack, sabotage of key facilities, the assassination of key crews
or** ~~paralyzing~~ **\[disrupting\] the command chain**]{.underline}.
**[As a submarine force is intensive regarding technologies and human
capital, such internal attacks could be more destructive. Owing to the
limited durability of diesel-electric submarines, loss of logistical
support could crucially erode Taiwan's underwater
capability]{.underline}** regardless of base locations. The various
espionage cases exposed in Taiwan also signify the danger and
feasibility of such internal threats.

#### Taiwanese submarine modernization inevitably fails -- Economic, technical, and strategic factors means any success takes more than decade 

**Scimia 18** (Emanuele Scimia - Independent journalist and foreign
affairs analyst, specializing in geopolitical analysis. \<MKIM\>
"Taiwan's dream of having its own submarine fleet must yield to a more
realistic China defence plan". 7/19/18. DOA: 7/6/19.
https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2155881/taiwans-dream-having-its-own-submarine-fleet)

According to recent media reports, **[foreign shipbuilders have offered
Taiwan]{.underline}** hull **[designs for its indigenous defence
submarine]{.underline}** **[programme]{.underline}**. Taiwanese Defence
Minister Yen Teh-fa dismissed similar rumours in May, denying that 200
US naval specialists would take part in the submarine project. It is
unlikely that the United States, Japan, India or Europe will risk
damaging ties with China by providing Taipei with submarine technology.
This is particularly true of countries in Europe. It is not by chance
that, in the joint statement of the 20th EU-China Summit, held in
Beijing on Monday, there is no reference to the Taiwan issue, even
though the document does include a paragraph on the disputed South China
Sea, as "soft" as it looks. But **[even if Taipei]{.underline}**
**[did]{.underline}** **[manage to procure]{.underline}** a **[foreign
design,]{.underline}** **[its submarine programme could prove
economically, technically and strategically unfeasible.]{.underline}**
The Taiwanese government aims to build eight diesel-electric submarines
to bolster its four outdated vessels. They should serve as an asymmetric
asset to deter a potential invasion from the mainland.
**[Beijing]{.underline}** has **[ramped up naval sorties around the
island]{.underline}** **[since Tsai Ing-wen]{.underline}**, chairwoman
of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party,
**[took]{.underline}** over as Taiwan's **[president]{.underline}** in
2016. Communist **[China considers Taiwan a rebel province that must be
reunited]{.underline}** with the mainland, if need be **[by
force]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}** first **[problem is that
Taiwan has to develop a submarine fleet from scratch, and this comes at
an exorbitant cost]{.underline}.** To have an idea of just how expensive
it is, Germany's capable Type 214 diesel-electric submarine, which is
also operated by the South Korean navy, has a price tag of about US\$500
million. Not to mention the **[considerable expenses for crew
training]{.underline}** that **[should be added to the
bill]{.underline}**. The **[Tsai]{.underline}** administration has so
far **[failed to walk the talk on the defence budget. In
2016]{.underline}**, then defence minister **[Feng Shih-kuan revealed
Taipei's plans to raise military spending to US\$13
billion]{.underline}** during his first year in office, **[but it stood
at US\$9.9 billion in 2017]{.underline}**, according to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute -- to make a comparison,
**[China's was US\$228 billion]{.underline}**. Last October, Tsai
claimed her government would boost future defence expenditure by 2 or 3
per cent per year. She is unlikely to fulfil that promise. **[It has
been reported that the island's military budget will grow in 2019, but
not in the way the Ministry of National Defence expects]{.underline}**.
**[Overall spending will not]{.underline}** see a big
**[increase]{.underline}**, in fact, **[given]{.underline}** a
**[shortfall in]{.underline}** projected **[tax revenues]{.underline}**.
In addition, **[the submarine project will inevitably run into technical
hiccups if Taipei has to integrate complex systems from different
countries]{.underline}** and models. Apart from the hull design, Taiwan
needs diesel-electric engines and air-independent propulsion (AIP)
technology, which increases the undersea autonomy of a conventional
submarine, for its future boats. In 1979, Washington switched formal
diplomatic recognition to Beijing from Taipei, but it must help the
island maintain its self-defence capabilities in accordance with the
Taiwan Relations Act. **[Though the US]{.underline}** Senate version of
the **[defence appropriation bill]{.underline}** for 2019
**[supports]{.underline}** the **[acquisition of defensive weaponry for
undersea warfare by Taiwan]{.underline}**, **[and the]{.underline}** US
**[State Department authorised American contractors to sell submarine
components]{.underline}** to Taipei in April, **[Washington has limited
options to contribute to the island's submarine
programme]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[the US Navy has only
nuclear-powered submarines and]{.underline}** US defence shipbuilders
**[do not build diesel-electric platforms]{.underline}**. That means
**[Taiwan will have to get into the delicate and costly business of
assembling European or Japanese hull designs, diesel-electric motors and
AIP technology with US combat systems to realise its new
boats]{.underline}**. More importantly, **[Taipei has to deal with its
strategic weaknesses. It needs time to build and commission
submarines]{.underline}**. **[In the best case, the Taiwanese navy could
deploy the first vessel in the late 2030s]{.underline}**, and the
refitting of its two ageing, Dutch-manufactured Zwaardvis submarines
would have to fill this operational vacuum. For its part, China has 73
submarines in service, according to Global Firepower, of which a dozen
are nuclear-powered. **[The mismatch between Beijing and Taipei in the
undersea warfare domain is evident]{.underline}**, but also in other
realms affecting the island's security (anti-ship and land attack
missiles, rocket artillery and airborne assault). Geography counts in
cross-strait relations. **[Taiwan is a small island off the coast of a
continental superpower. To build up its asymmetric capacities against a
possible naval attack from the mainland, Taipei should focus on more
affordable and less complex arms]{.underline}** systems **[than
submarines]{.underline}**, such as fast-attack boats equipped with
anti-ship missiles and corvettes. It should also invest in minelayers
and land-based and mobile anti-ship missile batteries. As Lyle
Goldstein, a research professor at the US Naval War College, told me, in
its quest for asymmetric capabilities, **[Taiwan should factor in the
"opportunity costs" of constructing a submarine fleet]{.underline}** --
a problem that is also afflicting the Philippines, which is reportedly
trying to expedite the purchase of an undefined number of submarines
amid China's growing military pressure in the South China Sea.

# Case Answers

## Independence Debate

### reunification inev/no independence

#### Trade ties make closer Taiwanese ties with China inevitable

**Chen 19** (Dr. Charles I-hsin Chen is Executive Director of the
Institute for Taiwan-America Studies at Washington D.C., The Diplomat,
6-14-2019, \"Why the US May Lose Taiwan to Beijing Economically,\"
Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/why-the-us-may-lose-taiwan-to-beijing-economically/)SEM

In March 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the House
Foreign Affairs Committee that China is a threat to the United States.
"This is a great power battle and we're engaged in it across the world,"
he added. [China now challenges American influence in]{.underline} all
aspects, and [Taiwan]{.underline} represents a frontier in this hybrid
competition. While the island's security still relies heavily on
Washington's guarantees, **[[there's a]{.mark} rising [risk that
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [may lose Taiwan]{.mark} to
Beijing [economically]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There are three reasons
for this trend. A Drifting Taiwan The first is Taiwan's drift.
[[Taiwan's]{.mark} trade [dependency]{.mark} on the United States
[was]{.mark} largely [replaced]{.mark} by dependency on China [after
2001]{.mark}]{.underline}, when both Taiwan and China entered the World
Trade Organization (WTO). The share of Taiwan's total trade involving
the United States halved, falling from 23 percent to 12 percent, from
1998 to 2018, while [[China's share doubled]{.mark} from 15 [to 31
percent]{.mark}]{.underline}. In January 2017, Taiwan adopted a New
Southbound Policy (NSP) attempting to divert the island's exports away
from China and into South and Southeast Asia, but without concrete
results. [[Taiwan's]{.mark} export [reliance]{.mark} on China
[increased]{.mark} 2 percentage points [to]{.mark} 41 percent in 2018,
peaking historically at [45 percent]{.mark}]{.underline} that March,
while the export share to the 18 countries covered in the NSP decreased
by 1 percentage point in the same period. Simply put, this new policy
did not work well. Even worse, [Taiwan's global strategy is not leading
anywhere]{.underline}. There are two groups of regional integration
emerging around Taiwan, but the island is unlikely to enter either.
First, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which
targets 16 Asia-Pacific countries, including China, would require Taiwan
to join as a province of China --- a condition Taiwan simply cannot
accept. Second is the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for
Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which includes 11 Trans-Pacific
countries, now led by Japan after the withdrawal of the United States.
However, China may also block Taiwan by pressuring its partners to veto
any Taiwanese bid to join. The alternative for Taiwan to promote its
trade relations is to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with major
economies. Yet the political issue of the status of Taiwan would halt
most negotiations in the first round. Unfortunately, [Taiwan's economy
is drifting to the middle of nowhere]{.underline}. A Pulling China The
second factor is China's pull. [**[China's economic attraction]{.mark}
for Taiwan [is growing at]{.mark} both the [regional]{.mark} and local
[levels]{.mark}.** China's GDP per capita has increased nine
times]{.underline} on a purchasing-power-parity basis [since 1990. This
formed a strong economic gravity pulling all neighboring economies into
China's orbit --- and particularly Taiwan]{.underline}, which is just
100 nautical miles off the mainland's southeast coast. [China now is
capable of offering **lucrative incentives** to convert the loyalty of
its commercial allies as the]{.underline} existing economic hegemon ---
namely, the [United States]{.underline} --- [is in relative
decline]{.underline}. For example, some [[Eurasian
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} in developing or underdeveloped countries
may [[see]{.mark} China's [Belt and Road]{.mark} Initiative [as a good
opportunity]{.mark}. They may also feel that the]{.underline}
Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ([AIIB) is more
accessible than the]{.underline} American-led [World Bank]{.underline}
in granting big loans for development projects. [At the local level,
China's [econ]{.mark}omic [influence]{.mark} on Taiwan specifically [has
become]{.mark} more **tangible and
[comprehensive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since the late 1980s, Taiwanese
investment had been lured by preferential policies from Chinese central
and local governments. As of last year, the total amount of [Taiwanese
investment in China has accumulated to \$180 billion]{.underline} --- 10
times the Taiwanese investment in the United States in the same period.
As a result, over [400,000 Taiwanese quality managers and talents are
currently working and living in Chinese cities]{.underline} with their
family members. The total number may surpass 2 million people, close to
one-tenth of Taiwan's population. In terms of cross-strait relations,
[the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resumed warm ties in 2008 and
reached 23 agreements during Ma Ying-jeou's presidency]{.underline}. Yet
the official channel of dialogue was suspended after President Tsai
Ing-wen's inauguration in May 2016. Beijing began to unilaterally
conduct cross-strait affairs without prior consultation or negotiation
with Taipei. Even while cross-strait tensions rose, [in January 2018,
quasi-citizenship was granted to Taiwanese living, studying, or working
in China and some national treatments involving subsidies or bank loans
were opened to Taiwanese enterprises. Beijing's carrot-and-stick
approach towards Taiwan remains, and **the [carrot is growing
sweeter]{.mark}.**]{.underline} A Pushing America Meanwhile, [the United
States risks pushing Taiwan away]{.underline}. President Donald [Trump's
[Taiwan policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, if there is one, [[has been
inconsistent]{.mark} between political and economic affairs since 2017.
In politics, the United States has strengthened its security commitment
to Taiwan to tackle the escalating tension in the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}. The new Taiwan Travel Act, taking effect in March
2018, encouraged more frequent and higher level official exchanges
between Washington and Taipei. To maintain Taiwan's capacity of
self-defense, informal notification of a \$2 billion [sale
of]{.underline} 108 M1A2 tanks and [weapons was sent to the U.S.
Congress]{.underline} in early June. Another, bigger package ---
possibly including 66 F-16V fighter jets --- may also seek Congress'
approval later this year. The Pentagon has further made naval patrols in
the Taiwan Strait a new normal to contain Beijing's maritime aggression.
Nonetheless, [**these [policy favors do not apply to the economic
field]{.mark}**. While economic ties have faded in recent years, the
U.S. Trade Representative]{.underline} (USTR) [Office did not change its
tough attitude toward Taiwan]{.underline}. Its latest annual report
reiterated serious concerns over Taiwan's bans on U.S. pork products and
beef products containing ractopamine. Due to this first priority issue,
the [[USTR]{.mark} has [suspended]{.mark} regular [trade
talks]{.mark}]{.underline} since October 2016, [[and put]{.mark} on
[hold the]{.mark} initial [steps of preparing an FTA]{.mark} with
Taiwan.]{.underline} During the APEC summit last November, U.S. Vice
President Mike Pence agreed to bring the Taiwanese envoy's request to
restart talks back to Washington but there was no change. Apparently,
the USTR is not inclined to compromise on this issue. Another case is
even more acute and embarrassing. [[Taiwan was subjected to Trump's
tariffs]{.mark} on steel and aluminum imports to the United
States]{.underline} starting in March 2018, [because Taiwanese steel
products were suspected to contain China-made steel. In response,
[Taiwan resorted to severe measures that restricted]{.mark} its [steel
products]{.mark} with any content of China-made steel from being
exported to the U.S. market. Taipei even launched a
self-investigation]{.underline} into dumping and government subsidies
focused on select China-made steel products sold in Taiwan from 2015 to
2017. [Embarrassingly, these extra efforts were all in vain, and Taiwan
was not included on the tariff exemption list. **While politicians in
Washington have been wooing Taiwan, their economists are sabotaging that
effort.**]{.underline}

[The threat of "miscalculation" is again in vogue.]{.underline} What was
once a preoccupation of accidental war theorists has resurfaced in
discussions about [maritime disputes in Southeast Asia and Sino-U.S.
relations.]{.underline} During the Cold War, policymakers and scholars
worried about nuclear annihilation sparked by misinterpreted warnings,
rogue officers, technical glitches in command and control systems, or a
lower-level confrontation spiraling out of control. Absent the Cold
War's looming nuclear threat, today's oft-repeated concerns focus on
"miscalculation" causing a local or tactical-level incident between
individual ships or aircraft (harassment, collision, interdiction, and
so on) to lead to broader military confrontation. Some variation of this
theme has been featured in public remarks by former U.S. Defense
Secretaries Gates, Panetta, Hagel, and current Defense Secretary Carter,
as well as Commanders of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and the U.S. Pacific
Command, and was a topic of policymaker discussion going back at least
to the 1996 Taiwan Strait incident. These concerns are likewise found in
too many op-eds, reports, interviews, commentaries, and articles to
count (see also here, here, here, and here, etc.) However, [while
history shows that strategic miscalculations can lead states to war, or
dangerously close to it, **evidence does not support** the worry that
**miscalculation may cause a local or tactical-level incident to spiral
out of control**]{.underline}. ¶ To understand the risks associated with
miscalculation, w[e must distinguish between miscalculation at the
strategic level and miscalculation stemming from a localized incident
between naval or air forces.]{.underline} At the strategic level -- that
is, a nation's a priori willingness to escalate a conflict and use
military force to achieve its objectives -- [no country starts a war
expecting to lose.]{.underline} Yet, "most wars...end in the defeat of
at least one nation which had expected victory," implying [all wars
result from some degree of strategic miscalculation. That may be a
plausible danger in Southeast Asia, but a distinct one]{.underline}.
Instead, [much of the **discourse about** localized maritime **incidents
in the South China Sea conflates strategic and local miscalculation
risks**, focusing on the latter's potential to lead to a wider
conflict]{.underline}. ¶ This concern over local miscalculation
nonetheless reflects a longstanding view of the danger "incidents at
sea" poses to peace stretching back to the Cold War. Both U.S. and
Soviet leaderships were concerned that an incident between "peppery
young ship captains" could "lead people to shoot at each other with
results that might...be impossible to control," in the words of Admiral
Elmo Zumwalt, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations in the 1970s. Back then,
the U.S. and Soviets were openly adversarial and serious incidents
between their ships and aircraft were almost commonplace. Yet despite
explicit mutual, strategic, and existential antagonism between the U.S.
and U.S.SR, [none of the hundreds of maritime incidents that occurred
over the four decades of the Cold War escalated into anything beyond a
short diplomatic crisis]{.underline}. It is possible that they avoided a
nuclear spiral in these incidents through diligent diplomacy and luck.
But more likely[, it suggests that this type of maritime incident is
insufficient on its own to lead to the worst-case scenarios
envisioned]{.underline}. ¶ Mitigating the miscalculation concerns of
officials and the extreme scenarios of some commentators is that these
maritime incidents do not occur in a vacuum, de-coupled from explicit
national interests. In a famous 1988 Cold War incident, Soviet vessels
in the Black Sea shouldered the U.S. warships Yorktown and Caron (a
controlled collision meant to push a ship off-course) while the latter
were deliberately contesting what the U.S. deemed excessive Soviet legal
claims over maritime rights. The Soviets knew the U.S. vessels were
there to intentionally flout their claims, and the U.S. knew the Soviets
would likely try to enforce them. Even if the firmness of the Soviet
response was unanticipated (or deemed unlikely), there was no mystery to
either side's objectives. Thus, neither side was going to start shooting
in confusion; the Soviet vessels even radioed their intention to strike
the U.S. ships. ¶ While not "safe" in the strictest sense (ships do not
like to "swap paint" with each other), footage from the Yorktown and
Caron being pushed shows the actions to be intense but deliberate,
professionally executed, and clearly of an enforcement nature, rather
than a prelude to combat. While a serious diplomatic incident, both
sides understood the situation, which served to moderate concern over
escalation. Similarly, a shouldering incident between the U.S. cruiser
Cowpens and a Chinese warship in 2013, while concerning to the U.S. from
a safety-at-sea perspective, was understood to be motivated by Chinese
sensitivities around testing their new aircraft carrier, not a precursor
to hostilities. ¶ [Nonetheless, concerns over maritime incidents,
miscalculation, and spiraling conflict contain enough intuitive logic to
have endured]{.underline}. A shared Cold War concern over
miscalculations led to accords that are still in effect, such as the
Agreement on the Prevention of Incidents on and Over the High Seas
(INCSEA) and Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities (DMA)
agreement, and may be credited with helping keep incidents between the
U.S. and U.S.SR under "control." However, the fact that agreements were
reached at all is likely more significant than their content. Such
agreements indicated a shared belief between U.S. and Soviet military
leaderships that despite their feverish preparations for war against one
another, neither wanted war to come as the result of a tactical-level
incident between individual ships and aircraft. This suggests neither
would let an incident, however serious, become an independent casus
belli. ¶ The substance of these accords (and those reached in the South
China Sea) further strengthens this thesis. While INCSEA and DMA
contained rules of behavior, these were, again in Zumwalt's words,
"little more than a reaffirmation of the \[maritime\] Rules of the Road"
(international rules that direct how ships stay safe around each other
at sea). What was groundbreaking was that in concluding the accords, the
U.S. and U.S.SR implicitly recognized their intentions to violate those
rules and practices when advantageous (consider the Yorktown and Caron).
The accords created new parallel rules by which each could do so
"safely," as well as new communications protocols to inform one another
of their intentions. Together, this affirms that both sides were playing
a (serious) game to establish positions and assert rights more than they
were interested in war. Of course, incidents intended to reinforce
maritime claims and hostile actions can look the same right up until
ordnance is exchanged, but now both sides could be more confident that
if shooting did start, it was an intentional act of war. ¶ [Precedent
for Restraint]{.underline} ¶ In Asia, [there is recent and dramatic
precedent for restraint, even after an unambiguously hostile local
event,]{.underline} which belies theoretical arguments about the risk of
miscalculation and unintended escalation. When the South Korean warship
Cheonan was sunk in 2010, South Korea determined that North Korea was
responsible. [Far from a mere 'incident' of the sort worried over in the
South China Sea]{.underline}, this was a belligerent act against South
Korea's armed forces. And yet, [**there was no miscalculation-fueled
conflict spiral**, and instead a strategically calibrated
response.]{.underline} ¶ It remains unknown whether the sinking of the
Cheonan was ordered by the North Koreans (they continue to deny any
responsibility), the act of a renegade, or, perhaps least plausibly, an
accident. What is clear is that despite a sunken ship and 46 sailors
killed, the incident did not spiral out of control. This suggests that
South Korea's political calculus did not view militarily punishing North
Korea worth the risk of a renewed -- and potentially nuclear -- war,
which is to say that an extraordinary but tactical-level event did not
trump strategic preferences. ¶ [Even so, some take the
miscalculation-escalation dynamic so far as to suggest that incidents
between fishing vessels and coast guards in the South China Sea might
lead to war]{.underline}. In view of the Cold War record and the recent
Cheonan example, such propositions are drastically overstated. It is
conceivable that a state already resolved to escalate a dispute
militarily might view a local maritime incident as a convenient casus
belli. But in that emphatically calculated case, no institutional
impediments to such incidents would prevent the hostility. ¶ [On the
contrary, the prevalence of coast guards and fishing vessels is actually
a sign of restraint.]{.underline} For a front so often considered a
"flashpoint[," it is **notable how few incidents** **in the South China
Sea are between naval assets**]{.underline}. This is not accident or
luck, but instead suggests that regional players deliberately use
lightly armed coast guard and other para-military "white hull" vessels
to enforce their claims. Because these units do not have the ability to
escalate force the way warships do, it in fact signals their desire to
avoid escalation. And while "gray hull" naval vessels may be just over
the horizon providing an implicit threat of force, they can also provide
a further constraint on potential incidents; their very presence compels
parties to consider how far to escalate without inviting more serious
responses. ¶ As in the Cold War, parties in the South China Sea have
sought diplomatic mitigation of maritime incidents, principally through
the perennially-stalled Code of Conduct, the year-old Code for Unplanned
Encounters at Sea (CUES), and the bilateral Military Maritime
Consultative Agreement between the U.S. and China. But underpinning
concerns about miscalculation and escalation­, and mitigation efforts
like CUES, is the idea that by avoiding incidents the region will avoid
war. This belief is dangerous insofar as it conflates the symptoms of
the disputes (incidents at sea) with the terms of the dispute itself
(maritime rights and sovereignty). Incidents and the activities that
precipitate them help establish new and accepted regional norms and
"facts on the ground" (bloodlessly, if inelegantly). In that sense,
avoiding incidents sets back the de facto resolution of the disputes.
Since the balance of these evolving norms and facts on the ground
appears to favor China's efforts (e.g., using its coast guard to eject
fishing vessels from disputed waters and island reclamation projects),
it is neither surprising that China's regional rivals propose
institutional remedies like CUES and the Code of Conduct, nor that China
only agrees to them after negotiating away any legally binding
provisions. ¶ [The record suggests that **miscalculation concerns over
incidents in the maritime realm** are **exaggerated and can artificially
increase tensions**, raise threat perceptions, and justify arms
build-ups.]{.underline} Whether an incident is deliberate, or a true
organic accident, if it occurs within a dispute context where neither
side desires armed conflict, [it will not escalate at the strategic
level.]{.underline} However, because of the very seriousness of that
perceived escalation threat, the miscalculation narrative can also
motivate positive diplomatic efforts like INCSEA, DMA, and now CUES (not
to overstate their realistic contribution to resolving disputes). ¶
Further, for all its conceptual and historical problems, and not least
its potential to feed narratives of aggression, [another possible
advantage of focusing on "miscalculation" in the South China Sea is that
it allows countries to maintain ambiguity about the real terms of
dispute.]{.underline} Avoiding war is a distinct objective from
"solving" disputes; war is a dispute resolution mechanism after all. But
if peace is the priority, [ambiguity may be preferable if all that
clarity reveals is just how intractable those disputes may
be]{.underline}. Clarity can rob governments of the flexibility to
equivocate to their domestic audiences (and competitors) and force a
choice between escalating a conflict and backing down from their claims.
Then open conflict might become more realistic. Conversely, if all
parties are more or less content to live with ambiguity in the region's
maritime claims, then a somewhat mutually dissatisfying peace prevails,
but peace nonetheless. Everyone wants to win, but as long as everyone
also wants to avoid losing even more, occasional incidents do not have
to fuel strategic tension.

#### South China Sea isn't a flashpoint -- geography

**Taylor 14** -- Head of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the
Australian National University (Brendan, "The South China Sea is Not a
Flashpoint, The Washington Quarterly", 37:1, 99-111, DOI:
10.1080/0163660X.2014.893176)//js

[It is hard to envisage a credible scenario where a skirmish in the
South China Sea could erupt into a conflict of similar proportions. The
nationalist foundations of these disputes are fundamentally different
from those underpinning East Asia's traditional
flashpoints]{.underline}. By way of example, [recent polling suggests
that 87 percent of the Chinese public view Japan negatively, whilst 50
percent anticipate a military dispute with Japan.]{.underline}13
Reflecting this sentiment, when Tokyo announced its decision to purchase
contested Islands in the East China Sea from their private owner in
September 2012, this sparked widespread anti-Japanese protests across
China that spread to more than 100 cities.14 [Such public displays of
nationalist sentiment stand in marked contrast to June 2013 anti-China
protests in Hanoi]{.underline} following Vietnamese allegations that a
Chinese vessel had rammed and damaged a Vietnamese fishing boat.
Subsequently**[, a mere 150 protesters gathered in the city
center]{.underline}**.15 Crowds of comparable size have attended
anti-Chinese protests in the Philippines. For instance, a March 2012
protest outside the Chinese Embassy in Manila that organizers expected
to draw 1,000 protesters attracted barely half that number.16 [The
strategic geography of the South China Sea also militates against it
being a genuine flashpoint. Throughout history, large bodies of water
have tended to inhibit the willingness and ability of adversaries to
wage war]{.underline}. In The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, for
instance, John Mearsheimer refers to "the stopping power of water,"
writing of the limits that large bodies of water place on the capacity
of states to project military power---relative, at least, to when they
share common land borders.17 [Even when clashes at sea do occur, history
suggests that these generally afford statesmen greater time and space to
find diplomatic solutions]{.underline}. As Robert Ross observes, in such
cases "neither side has to fear that the other's provocative diplomacy
or movement of troops is a prelude to attack and immediately escalate to
heightened military readiness. [Tension can be slower to develop,
allowing the protagonists time to manage and avoid unnecessary
escalation]{.underline}."18 Ross' observation, in turn, dovetails
elegantly with the issue of proximity, which Hoyt regards as a defining
feature of a flashpoint. [The antagonists in the South China Sea
disputes are less proximate than in the case of the Korean
Peninsula]{.underline}---where the two Koreas share a land border that
remains the most militarized on earth. [The same can be said of the
Taiwan flashpoint. Indeed, the proximity of Taiwan to the mainland
affords Beijing credible strategic options]{.underline}--- and arguably
even incentives---[involving the use of force that are not available to
it in the South China Sea]{.underline}.19 Finally, and related to the
third of Hoyt's criteria, [the South China Sea cannot be said to engage
the vital interests of Asia's great powers.]{.underline} To be sure,
much has been made of India's growing interests in this part of the
world--- particularly following reports of a July 2011 face-off between
a Chinese ship and an Indian naval vessel that was leaving Vietnamese
waters.20 However, New Delhi's interests in the South China Sea remain
overwhelmingly economic, not strategic, driven as they are by the search
for oil. Moreover, even if New Delhi had anything more than secondary
strategic interests at stake in the geographically distant South China
Sea, it is widely accepted that India's armed forces will for some time
lack the capacity to credibly defend these.21 Similarly, while much has
been made of Tokyo's willingness to assist Manila with improving its
maritime surveillance capabilities,22 for reasons of history and
geography, [Tokyo's interests in the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands dispute, the
Korean Peninsula, and even the Taiwan flashpoint dwarf those which it
has at stake in the]{.underline} more distant [South China
Sea.]{.underline} [The extent to which this body of water genuinely
engages the vital interests of China and the United States continues to
be overstated.]{.underline}

Conclusion To varying degrees, **[authors]{.underline}** in this issue
generally **[agree that conflict can be avoided and that there are
spaces for potential compromise]{.underline}**. Fravel, for example,
cites historical precedents where **[China has been willing to make
territorial compromises in support of larger strategic and political
objectives]{.underline}**; he also sees opportunities in China's
exclusion of the Spratlys from its drawing of its baselines.52 Goldstein
draws attention to **[the concern for moderation and compromise from
China's senior leadership, as well as key naval
higher-ups]{.underline}**; Thayer highlights **[the mechanisms and
interests that exist to counter more emotional and violent
reactions]{.underline}**. Womack, along with Fravel and Thayer, sees
China and ASEAN states' 2011 agreement and attention to implementing the
DoC as a significant recognition by states of the need to reduce
tensions, especially as it involved critical and symbolic concessions,
especially on the parts of China and Vietnam. Much like the original
DoC, the 2011 agreement and \[End Page 285\] states' ability to overcome
their stalemate expressed a common interest to ratchet down the dispute
from where it was in 2009 and 2010. **[While acknowledging the need for
"bolder" measures, Womack sees the DoC as both "reasonable" and
"promising" as a framework that moreover can provide the basis for "a
more robust Spratly Management Authority]{.underline}**". Most of all,
**[authors mostly see the prospects for major conflict being mitigated
by an unfavourable cost-benefit calculus where the costs of conflict and
militarization will be high and the benefits far from
clear.]{.underline}** Certainly, **[this is true of Southeast Asia's
weaker states, but it is also true of the major powers --- China and
theUnited States]{.underline}**. For China, for example, Womack is
strongest in seeing militarization of the dispute as contrary to China's
"quarter century of broad and peaceful development" and reform-era
policies and diplomacy that have served it very well. **[A South China
Sea conflict scenariowould also likely have ripple effects along China's
periphery among other neighbouring and lesser states that are most
vulnerable to Chinese power.]{.underline}** Given the attention and
priority that has been given to stabilizing China's periphery these past
two decades, **[it hardly seems in China's interest to militarize the
South China Sea in such a way that invites more active interventions
from others in the seas around it]{.underline}**, especially **[given
its own reliance on those watersto get goods in and out]{.underline}**.
At minimum, militarization would divert resources and attention from
both domestic and other global objectives, with active defence of claims
requiring "diplomatic and military efforts of the utmost magnitude".53
Womack is blunt in his argument that the Spratlys, in the larger scheme
of Chinese objectives, is insignificant: "\[**[T\]here is no threshold
of military superiority that would make it beneficial for China to
establish its control over all the Spratlys at the cost of strategic
hostility with Southeast Asia]{.underline}**." By one argument, **[China
has the most to lose with the militarizationof the South China Sea
dispute]{.underline}**. As for the United States, Goldstein is most
direct in considering the risks and costs of US involvement. Much as is
the case in his discussion on US assessments of China, Goldstein's
concern is that too **[much is assumed of US power and attraction, and
too much weight has already been placed on a dispute that is not that
important to US larger interests or global balance of
power]{.underline}**. As already noted, Washington's diplomatic
intervention has already been at cost to US-China relations in other
areas. **[US-China tensions also]{.underline}** \[End Page 286\]
potentially **[push away Southeast Asian states who fear great power
conflict more than they want the US to balance China]{.underline}**.54
Most of all, Goldstein warns the United States against "competing for
the sake of competing" and to guard against over-involving itself in a
conflict that risks US credibility, if not lives (as it did forty years
ago in Vietnam).

scientist Samuel Huntington's 1968 book, Political Order in Changing
Societies, is that as states develop large middle classes, the greater
the possibility is for political unrest. This will encourage China's
leadership to stoke nationalism even further as a means of social
cohesion. While skeptics, particularly in the world business community,
see the South and East China seas as constituting just a bunch of rocks
jutting out into the water, the Chinese masses don't see it that way. To
them, almost like Taiwan, [the South China Sea is sacred territory. And
the only fact that prevents China from becoming even more aggressive in
the East China Sea is the fear that Japan could defeat it in an open
conflict]{.underline}---something that would so humiliate Beijing's
leadership that it could call into question the stability of the
Communist Party itself. So [**China will wait a number of years until it
surpasses Japan in naval and air power.** Beijing's rulers know how
closely their strategy dovetails with the feelings of the Chinese
masses]{.underline}. Indeed, this new cold war is more susceptible to
irrational passions fueled by economic disruptions than the old Cold
War. In the second half of the 20th century, the United States and the
Soviet Union each had internal economies-of-scale (however different
from each other), that were far better protected from [the destabilizing
forces of globalization than the American and Chinese economies are
now.]{.underline} It is precisely the fusion of military, trade,
economic, and ideological tensions, combined with the destabilization
wrought by the digital age---with its collapse of physical
distance---that has created an unvirtuous cycle for relations between
the United States and China. The geopolitical challenge of the first
half of the 21st century is stark: how to prevent the U.S.-China cold
war from going hot. Preventing a hot war means intensified diplomacy not
only from the State Department but also from the Pentagon---American
generals talking and visiting with Chinese generals in order to create a
network of relationships that are the equivalent of the old Cold War
hotline. This diplomacy must avoid the temptation of reducing the
American-Chinese relationship to one contentious theme, be it trade or
the South China Sea. It can mean playing hard on trade but always
keeping the public rhetoric cool and reasoned. Passion becomes the real
enemy in this competition, because in the megaphone world of global
social media, passion stirs the impulse to assert status, which has
often been a principal source of wars. And it means most of all stealing
a concept from the American diplomat George Kennan's playbook on
containment: Be vigilant, but be always willing to compromise on
individual issues and in crises. Wait them out. Because, in a very
different way than the old Soviet system, the Chinese system---the more
authoritarian it gets---is over time more prone to crack up than
America's.

#### [No ECS war]{.underline} --- [interdependence]{.underline} and [deterrence]{.underline}.

This is all dramatically overblown. [War between China and Japan is
**more than unlikely**: it would **fly in the face** of most of what we
know about the two countries, and **international relations more
broadly**]{.underline}. It's not that a replay of 1914 is impossible.
[It's]{.underline} just [**deeply**, **vanishingly
unlikely**]{.underline}. Power One of the easiest ways to evaluate the
risks of Sino-Japanese war is by reference to three of the most
important factors that shape a government's decision to go to war: the
balance of power, economic incentives, and ideology. These categories
roughly correspond to the three dominant theories in modern
international relations (realism, liberalism, and constructivism), and
there's solid statistical evidence that each of them can play a
significant role in how governments think about their decisions to use
military force. So let's take them in turn. [The main source of tension
is an East China Sea island chain]{.underline}, called the Senkakus in
Japan and Diaoyus in China. While there are other potential flashpoints,
the current heightened tensions are centered on the Senkaku/Diaoyu
dispute. Japan currently controls the islands, but China claims them,
and the Chinese military has made increasingly aggressive noises about
the islands of late. [But there's one big factor shaping the balance of
power in East Asia that means the **talk is likely to remain just
that**: **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. The tagline for World War I in
1914 --- "The War To End All Wars" --- would have a decidedly different
meaning in 2014, as war's end would be accomplished by the world's end.
So whereas, [in 1914, all of the European powers **thought they could
win the war decisively**, East Asia's great powers recognize the risk of
a nuclear exchange]{.underline} between the United States and China [to
be **catastrophic**]{.underline}. Carleton University's Stephen Saideman
calls this the end of the "preemption temptation;" [**nobody** thinks
they can win by striking first anymore]{.underline}. Indeed, despite the
words of some of its military leaders, [China]{.underline} (at least
nominally) [has a **no-clash-with-Japan policy** in place over the
islands]{.underline}. That also helps explain why the most
commonly-cited Senkaku/Diaoyu spark, [accidental escalation, **isn't as
likely as many suggest**]{.underline}. When The Wall Street Journal's
Andrew Browne writes that there's a "real risk of an accident leading to
a standoff from which leaders in both countries would find it hard to
back down in the face of popular nationalist pressure," he's not wrong.
But it won't happen just because two planes happen across each other in
the sky. [In 2013, with **tensions running high the whole year**, Japan
scrambled fighters against Chinese aircraft **433 times**]{.underline}.
Indeed, [tensions have flared up a **number of times throughout the
years**]{.underline} (often sparked by nationalist activists on side of
the other) [**without** managing to bleed over into war]{.underline}.
That's because, as MIT East Asia expert M. Taylor Fravel argues, [there
are deep strategic reasons why each side is, broadly speaking, **OK with
the status quo over** and **above nuclear deterrence**. China has an
interest in **not seeming like an aggressor state in the region**, as
that's historically caused other regional powers to **put away their
differences** and **line up against it**. Japan currently has control
over the islands, which would make any strong moves by China seem like
an **attempt to overthrow the status quo power balance**]{.underline}.
The United States also has a habit of constructive involvement, subtly
reminding both sides when tensions are spiking that the United
States --- and its rather powerful navy --- would prefer that there be
no fighting between the two states. Moreover, [the whole idea of
"accidental war" is also a **little bit confusing**. Militaries **don't
just start shooting** each other by mistake and then decide it's time to
have a war.]{.underline} Rather, an incident that's truly
accidental --- say, a Japanese plane firing on a Chinese aircraft in one
of the places where their Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZs)
overlap --- changes the incentives to go to war, as the governments
start to think (perhaps wrongly) that war is inevitable and the only way
to win it is to escalate. [It's **hard to envision** this kind of shift
in calculation in East Asia, for all of the aforementioned
reasons.]{.underline}

[Tensions in the South China Sea]{.underline}, specifically the Spratly
Islands, are [set to continue]{.underline} as the U.S. and China
continue playing their game of "chicken" with one another. [However,
these military tensions between the two powers are **only symptoms** of
the fact that China already perceives the U.S. as the chicken in the
region.]{.underline} ¶ Economic Entanglement ¶ [From the Chinese
perspective, any war between the U.S. and China has already been won, by
China]{.underline}. China learned from the former Soviet Union and
started to enmesh the U.S. economy with its own from the time of Richard
Nixon. This enmeshing has only increased in recent times, giving the
U.S. pause in any potential wargaming scenarios. Ironically, this was
the very same basis used in the formation of what was eventually to
become the EU. At the time, it was thought that entangling France and
West Germany with one another economically would serve to dampen any
future fires of conflict between the two rivals. ¶ [China's formidable
economic power has also had a substantial dampening effect on U.S.
allies in the region as well]{.underline}. In any South China Sea
conflict, the most important of these two would be Vietnam and the
Philippines. While the recent ASEAN meeting in the Sunnylands did manage
to produce a shared statement by the attendees rebuking China's maritime
conduct in the region, it still did not quite go as far as the host, the
U.S., would have liked. This will remain the case as long as China, not
the U.S. or Japan, continues to be the dominant trading partner of most
states in the region. ¶ Freedom of Navigation ¶ [China is also aware
that U.S. claims to protect "freedom of navigation" in the region is
starting to ring hollow, even with some U.S. allies.]{.underline} Any
thoughts of China somehow restricting commercial "freedom of navigation"
in the region would not only be detrimental to China itself, but to
nearly all of its regional trading partners as well. ¶ Rather, it is the
increasing Chinese capability to restrict military "freedom of
navigation" with its anti-access aerial-denial strategy that worries the
U.S.. This is why the U.S. sent two B-52 bombers through China's East
China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) immediately after its
declaration. China also hasn't failed to notice U.S. "freedom of
navigation" operations (FONOPS) in the area. [Tellingly, the U.S. has
only received lukewarm material support from its allies in these
endeavors, even from its most committed Asian ally, Japan]{.underline}.
¶ Whose core strategic interest? ¶ [Additionally, the U.S. recently
announced that it would be relocating some of its bombers in the region
to Australia in order to ensure they are **out of Chinese missile
range**.]{.underline} As this missile range inevitably increases, will
the bombers be relocated again, even farther out of range? The message
that [China, as well as U.S. regional allies glean from this reaction,
is that the **U.S. is ultimately unwilling to face material sacrifices
to protect a non-core strategic interest.**]{.underline} ¶ At the end of
the day, [**the South China Sea matters a lot more to China than to the
U.S**., and now the rest of Asia knows it as well]{.underline}. The
argument can and has been made that protecting "freedom of navigation"
globally is a core U.S. interest as the global hegemon. For historical
and geographical reasons, China will not be moved by this argument. ¶
Lastly, **[there will be no intimidating a fellow nuclear
power.]{.underline}** Currently, much is made of North Korean nuclear
threats against the United States. However, it should not be forgotten
that China itself has implicitly threatened a nuclear strike against the
U.S., asking the U.S. in 1997 if it had any interest worth losing Los
Angeles over. Without some type of modus vivendi between the two powers,
akin to Hugh White's suggestion in The China Choice: Why We Should Share
Power, competition and security risk in the South China Sea will only
increase over time.

## Taiwan War Advantage

[Good policy making benefits from factually up-to-date]{.underline},
**[open-source analysis taking place in a public space and conducted by
policy specialists, journalists, and scholars]{.underline}**. **[This
kind of analysis is even more critical when its subject is
Taiwan]{.underline}**, a country of pivotal importance for U.S.
interests in East and Southeast Asia. [Yet, more often than not,
Taiwan-related analysis is based on outdated narratives and incomplete
understandings]{.underline} that offer only misleading policy
implications. For example, in [a recent article]{.underline} for The
National Interest, Michael Casey [offers a conventional view on the near
future of relations between China and Taiwan under which cross-Strait
relations are "threatened" when the]{.underline} pro-Taiwanese
independence Democratic Progressive Party ([DPP) is in
power]{.underline}: Even though President Tsai espouses a more moderate
approach to cross-Strait relations than her DPP predecessor, her
policies and especially the actions of her party threaten cross-Strait
relations... President Tsai established a mechanism to resolve maritime
disputes with Japan... Both sides enjoyed closer relations during the
previous KMT administration of President Ma Ying-jeou from 2008 to 2016,
and the PRC will do what it can to precipitate a return to KMT rule.
There is some indication that Beijing will aggressively pressure the new
president and explore how far it can go in imposing its own terms on the
relationship. This reading of affairs is remarkable, not the least
because Casey apparently thinks Taipei negotiating to solve mutual
problems with Tokyo is somehow provocative. Casey correctly asserts that
Beijing prefers the (Kuomintang) KMT to the DPP, and seems to think that
Washington should as well: The United States benefited from improved
cross-Strait relations under the previous KMT administration. Improved
relations freed scarce resources, such as the time and attention of
national-security decisionmakers, and permitted the Obama administration
to improve bilateral relations between the United States and ROC. The
United States has an abiding interest in peace and stability between
Beijing and Taipei. A return to the hostile noncontact that
characterized relations from 2000 to 2008 threatens the peaceful
management of other regional issues, such as North Korea or territorial
disputes in the East and South China Seas. He is hardly alone in this
assessment. Richard Bush, the prominent Taiwan expert at Brookings, also
argues that the past eight years across the Strait were beneficial for
the United States. In the run-up to the 2016 elections he asserted that
KMT's victory is preferable for U.S. interests (p. 21): Logically, the
outcome that would be best for the United States is a victory by Eric
Chu, because his cross-Strait policies would be consistent with Ma
Ying-jeou's, which have reduced the salience of the Taiwan issue in a
U.S.-China relationship littered with other problems. Likewise, Lyle J.
Goldstein, an incomparable expert on the People's Liberation Army,
echoes the hoary chestnut of peaceful relations on Ma Ying-jeou's watch:
The only reason that Taiwan has been, by and large, out of the headlines
since 2008 is that the island's leader Ma Yingjeou quite radically
shifted course from his two predecessors and bravely pursued a
rapprochement with the mainland. That far-sighted policy has made for
eight quiet years. Only readers unfamiliar with the very dicey situation
across the Taiwan Strait from 1997--2007 could fail to appreciate the
welcome and prosperous calm that has characterized the Taiwan issue over
the last several years. These are not a few cherry-picked quotes---such
analyses of cross-Strait relations from U.S. perspective are commonplace
(see here, here, here, or here). [Narratives like these generally rest
on three main assumptions]{.underline}. First, [Chen
Shui-bian's]{.underline} two-term [presidency]{.underline} (2000-2008),
the first for the erstwhile opposition DPP, [was one of constant
conflict across the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan was a
troublemaker]{.underline} rocking the boat, [increasing Chinese anxiety,
and potentially threatening to drag the United States into military
conflict]{.underline}. Second, [the era of]{.underline} KMT's
[Ma]{.underline} Ying-jeou (2008-2016) [was an eight-year-long bright
sunny day]{.underline} that came after the age of darkness. [Third, an
inevitable crisis is coming, because the DPP is in power
again]{.underline}. Take, for example, Professor Goldstein's argument
that "Only readers unfamiliar with the very dicey situation across the
Taiwan Strait from 1997-2007 could fail to appreciate the welcome and
prosperous calm that has characterized the Taiwan issue over the last
several years." [In fact, the]{.underline} [Chen Shui-bian era was a
golden age that saw cross-Strait trade increase nearly
twenty-fold]{.underline}, from \$4.5 billion in 1997 to \$98 billion in
2008. Chen legalized investment in China, and the air route between
Taipei and Hong Kong was among the busiest in the world. The so called
"three small links" (小三通) negotiations laid the foundation for
opening of regular commercial air, sea and postal links after 2008. The
Chen administration also saw negotiations on student exchanges, police,
and other key matters. Hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese went to work
in China, making tens of billions in investments, hardly possible if any
of them thought "tensions" were truly something to worry about. Of
course, there were heated words exchanged, but in the end, it was China
that broke off contact hoping that its intransigence would help the KMT
return to power. By contrast, the eight years of the Ma administration
saw trade grow a paltry \$17 billion (since 2008), a sum less than that
of any two-year period during the Chen era, and a collapse of Taiwan's
trade surplus with China, major factors in recent KMT election defeats.
Moreover, the relative calm in cross-Strait relations has meant only
increasing militarization of China's side of the Strait, as Taiwan's
defense ministry reports continuously stress. A similar point is made in
the Pentagon's annual reports on the Chinese military. [Predictably, the
DPP victory in 2016 has led to much scaremongering over the possibility
of renewed "tensions."]{.underline} Frequently cited evidence for
"renewed tensions" is the deportation of alleged scammers from Kenya to
China, the renewal of ties between Beijing and Gambia, and claims that
cross-Strait tourism has been slashed. The first probably had nothing to
do with Tsai Ing-wen (Beijing and Nairobi determined how to handle the
case a year before she was elected), the second is more likely related
to China's policies in North Africa toward Islamic militancy, and as for
the third, [the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan rose in February
and again in April.]{.underline} [Beijing has threatened to cut
negotiations and perhaps not accept visits from DPP officials, purely
symbolic moves.]{.underline} **[Beijing could concretely punish Taiwan,
but its available options all harm China and the political and economic
relationships Beijing has carefully cultivated in Taipei.]{.underline}**
It [is far more likely that Beijing---like so many other
observers---does not know what to do.]{.underline} [The most serious
error, however, widely found in Taiwan-related analysis, is delinking
cross-Strait relations from the policies that China pursues
elsewhere]{.underline}. [These pieces argue that calm in the Taiwan
Strait has allowed Washington to focus on crises in South and East China
Seas.]{.underline} Again, **[this stands reality on its head: Taiwan is
part of a broad front of expansion that includes the South China Sea,
Taiwan itself, the Senkakus, and possibly also Okinawa]{.underline}**.
[The "calm" of the Ma administration simply presented Beijing with the
opportunity to ramp up tensions elsewhere in the region]{.underline}.
[Pundits who argue that the United States should allow China to
"Finlandize" Taiwan can only do so by removing Taiwan from this context:
the next target, should Beijing get Taiwan, will be the Senkakus and
Okinawa, connected to Taiwan in Chinese claims]{.underline}. Nor should
it be forgotten that the infamous nine-dash line runs through the Bashi
Channel between Taiwan and Philippines. **[Once Beijing has Taiwan, it
will begin to eye new claims, something already happening in the South
China Sea]{.underline}**. Needless to say, [the United States has
defense treaties with both Tokyo and Manila. Taiwan is not sparking
confrontation, **but preventing a far more severe Great Power
confrontation**]{.underline}. [Far from driving new tensions, the DPP
victory presents an enormous opportunity for Washington to advance its
interests]{.underline} in East Asia and the South China Sea. [Unlike the
Ma administration, both Taiwan's democratically minded public and its
government are pro-America and pro-Japan]{.underline}. President Tsai
has indicated, for example, that she wants Taiwan to join the Trans
Pacific Partnership free-trade deal. The DPP has pledged to raise
defense expenditures and has a long history of attempted weapons
purchases from the United States. [Unlike the Ma administration, neither
the DPP nor the people of Taiwan have much emotional connection to the
ROC's island claims]{.underline}. The new government is promoting closer
relations with Tokyo and the southeast Asian states---**[thus reducing
tensions.]{.underline}** [With the United States and China confronting
each other across China's territorial expansion from India to the
Senkakus, Washington should be welcoming, not deploring, a pro-American
administration in Taipei that can support its multilateral efforts in
the region.]{.underline} **[U.S. policymakers should realize that
"tensions" across the Strait are not caused by decision makers in
Taipei, but are a policy choice of Beijing, which uses them as a tool to
influence major actors in the cross-Strait relationship]{.underline}**,
especially Washington. [It is striking indicator of Beijing's propaganda
success]{.underline} that only Taiwan is accused of "provoking"
tensions. India, Japan, Malaysia, or Vietnam are seldom so criticized,
though they confront the same expansion that Taipei does. The negative
response to the DPP is not only deeply outdated, but tragic and
incomprehensible given Washington's policies elsewhere in the world.
Washington pundits never argue that Poles, Latvians or Czechs should
vote for parties seeking a subservient approach to Russia. Taiwanese
voters have rejected the idea that they should forsake their hard-won
democracy to appease Beijing's desire to annex Taiwan. It is time for
Washington to follow their lead---and to grasp the hand they have
extended.

New Danger Over the Horizon? So is there a new round of danger ahead? In
less than nine months, on January 11th, [Taiwan will have presidential
and legislative elections]{.underline}. As in the past, the results
might change the current state of cross-Strait relations in a way that
Beijing finds threatening. But **[[the outcome might also work to its
advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At this point, [the situation is very
dynamic and confusing]{.underline}. I have to confess that I have no
idea what will happen in the 2020 Taiwan presidential election. In each
major party, there are rivals for the nomination: Chu Liluan and Wang
Jin-pyng are declared candidates in the KMT and Han Kuo-yu may become
one. [[Lai]{.underline}]{.mark} Ching-te [[has challenged
Tsai]{.underline}]{.mark} Ing-wen [in the DPP. And Taipei mayor
Ko]{.underline} Wen-je [may run as an independent]{.underline}. The KMT
hasn't yet decided on how to pick their candidate. It's worth noting
that not only do the various candidates differ on their basic policy
positions but they are also different in terms of political style. Wang
Jin-pyng and Chu Liluan are rather conventional politicians. Tsai
Ing-wen is an official who learned how to be a politician. Lai Ching-te,
Ko Wen-je, and Han Kuo-yu are more charismatic and populist. Until we
know who the contestants in the election are, it is very hard to make a
prediction. The [outcome will depend on the candidates themselves, on
the policy proposals they put forward, and on the organization they can
rely on to mobilize voters]{.underline}. There is one interesting data
point, however. That is the aggregate vote that the KMT and DPP received
in the 2018 local elections. The KMT's total vote in 2018 was 6,102,876
and the DPP's total vote was 4,697,730, That is, the KMT got 55.48
percent of the entire vote and the DPP got 44.52 percent. Specialists
believed prior to the 2016 election that the basic balance of sentiment
between the Blue and Green Camps was 55 percent for the Blues and 45
percent for the Greens. The implication here is that **[[the 2016
election was the anomaly and]{.mark} that [Taiwan politics is returning
to its previous balance of power between the Blue and Green
Camps]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But it's too early to say. Obviously, if
Ko Wen-je runs a strong independent campaign, that will mess up the
55-to-45 ratio. My guess, though is that he will take more votes from
the Green Camp than he will from the Blue. From Beijing's point of view,
it would prefer a Taiwan leader whose policies would be in line with Ma
Ying-jeou's. These would be Wang Jin-pyng, Chu Liluan, and perhaps Han
Kuo-yu. Beijing clearly hopes that the DPP candidate, whether it is Tsai
or Lai, will lose, but it has more to fear from Lai than
[Tsai]{.underline}. He is Deep Green while she is more moderate Light
Green. In my view at least, she really [is committed to maintaining the
status quo, in part because that's what the United States
prefers]{.underline}. I suspect that Beijing would also prefer a Taiwan
president who does not understand the history of cross-Strait relations
very well and so would not be so alert for the negotiating traps that
China might set. Ma Ying-jeou and Tsai Ing-wen each had that deep
understanding, even though they disagreed on some points. Although it is
early days, [each of the declared and potential candidates for 2020 have
a lot to learn]{.underline}. **[[Even if the DPP candidate wins, that
does not meant that the danger of war goes up]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
After all, [[China survived eight years of Chen]{.mark} Shui-bian [and
three of Tsai]{.mark} Ing-wen so far]{.underline}. It depends in part on
the policies that a DPP leader will pursue and what the United States
does. More important, [Beijing has an option that is in between
appeasement and war]{.underline}, and that is intimidation and pressure.
Indeed, **[[what we have seen for the past three years is a low-grade
version of that]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The **[[risks are
less]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the chance of success over the long term
isn't bad. We certainly haven't seen the maximum of what Beijing might
do to bend Taiwan to its will.

#### No risk of Taiwan war\-\--no independence move or Chinese provocation.

I actually believe that [the purpose of this action was to send a
political signal to the United States and Taiwan to express displeasure
at a variety of recent developments between them that suggested closer
cooperation]{.underline}. But this does raise the broader question of
just how dangerous the interaction amongst Beijing, Taipei, and
Washington is. Here, in conclusion, are my best estimates: First, absent
from a clear and strong provocation by Taiwan, such as a declaration of
independence, **[[China will not initiate a full scale military
campaign]{.underline}]{.mark}** against campaign **[[to achieve
unification]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It has other ways of pursuing its
goals]{.mark}, and it believes that over time it will become more
powerful]{.underline}. Also, **[[the two sides have been careful in
managing their interactions over the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But if Beijing were to continue to engage
in provocative actions as it did two weeks ago, it raises the
possibility of an accidental clash that could then escalate into a
broader conflict. Second, **[[the chances that Taiwan will declare
independence explicitly are close to zero]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
[[population is opposed to that]{.mark} and is unlikely to elect a
leader who might try it]{.underline}.

**And, no risk of war**

Beijing by telling an interview that the U.S.' "one China" policy was

closer engagement with Taiwan and apprehensions that Taiwan's status,
and U.S. assistance to the democratic island-nation, could also be used

Beijing]{.mark} and remove some of the incentives it had for punishing
Taiwan. By doing so, President Trump may therefore have removed some of
the variables that could have contributed to instability in the Taiwan

the wider Asia Pacific]{.underline}.

#### China wont use nukes in Taiwan or if the U.S. gets involved -- NFU will stay in-tact

[CHINA'S THINKING ON NUCLEAR STRATEGY HAS WITHSTOOD MILITARY STRUGGLES
OVER TAIWAN]{.underline} During the onset of political turmoil in
Beijing during the spring and summer of 1989, hostilities between China
and the Soviet Union ended, and the U.S.-China relationship quickly hit
rock bottom. The issue of Taiwan reemerged, but the situation was
different than in the past. Previously, the Kuomintang in Taipei had
sought to control all of China, and the low probability of this
occurring meant that Beijing could afford to wait for better conditions
to resolve the conflict. However, by 1989, the independence forces on
the island had expanded and wanted to split Taiwan from mainland China,
which greatly increased the urgency of the threat. Taiwanese separatist
forces repeatedly tested China's bottom line on the Taiwan issue, posing
a serious threat to the reunification of China and bringing questions
about the role of China's nuclear weapons to the fore. In this way,
China's nuclear strategy was put to the test once again. In the face of
increasingly bold Taiwanese separatist forces, Beijing issued an
explicit warning in November 2003: Taiwan's independence would mean
war.77 But if a war were to break out in the Taiwan Strait, would it be
a nuclear one? And if China's nuclear weapons were to play a role in a
potential military struggle against Taiwanese independence, what kind of
role would this be? Tere has been much discussion and speculation about
the role of nuclear weapons in dealing with Taiwan. At international
conferences, some scholars have mentioned the threat that Beijing's
nuclear weapons may pose to Taiwan. **[Others have said that when
Beijing talks about no first use, particularly against
non-nuclear-weapon states, it has been referring to foreign
countries]{.underline}**. **[Beijing, they point out, considers
Taiwanese independence a domestic Chinese issue]{.underline}**.
[Therefore, if war were to break out in the Taiwan Strait, they argue,
Beijing could use nuclear weapons on Taiwan]{.underline}.78 **[But these
[opinions reflect the speakers' superficial understanding of]{.mark}
nuclear weapons and [nuclear strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[along
with their misinterpretation of Beijing's nuclear
strategy]{.underline}**. If they were to think about it rationally, it
would not be difficult to find the answer: **[Because [China has
disavowed using nuclear weapons on non-nuclear-weapon states, why would
it use these weapons on its fellow countrymen]{.mark}?]{.underline}**
**[It is safe to say that Chinese leaders have never considered using
nuclear weapons on Taiwan.]{.underline}** Opposition to a U.S. military
intervention is a prominent issue in China's considerations about a
potential military struggle against Taiwanese independence. Given the
United States' huge advantages in conventional naval and air forces, as
well as its electronic military capabilities**[, [how would
China]{.mark} be able to effectively [deal with a U.S.
intervention]{.mark} in a military crisis in the Taiwan
Strait?]{.underline}** In July 2005, Major General Zhu Chenghu, a
professor at the National Defense University of the People's Liberation
Army, warned, "If the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided
ammunition on to the target zone on China's territory, I think we will
have to respond with nuclear weapons."79 Although the general's
statement was only a personal opinion, it had significant
repercussions.80 On one hand, it exacerbated U.S. suspicions about
China's no-first-use policy; on the other hand, it strengthened the
credibility of the Chinese military's determination to achieve national
reunification. In terms of the latter, this actually channeled the
spirit of Mao's steadfast refusal to submit to force. In fact, in U.S.
strategic planning, the Taiwan Strait has always been regarded as a
possible battlefield for the use of nuclear weapons. Te January 2002
Nuclear Posture Review by the U.S. Department of Defense identified
seven possible locations where nuclear weapons might be used, one of
which was the Taiwan Strait region.81 [Certain U.S. analysts have said
that the reason for including the Taiwan Strait was that the United
States thought that China would use nuclear weapons first if China were
to suffer a conventional military defeat in a potential Taiwan Strait
conflict]{.underline}.82 **[These U.S. observers clearly do not have a
finger on the pulse of China's nuclear strategy. [Neither]{.mark} the
risks of [Taiwanese separatist]{.mark} forces [nor]{.mark} an increased
threat of [U.S. military intervention would lead China to abandon its
fundamental policy of no first use]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
Diversified Employment of China's Armed Forces, a white paper released
in April 2013, made no statements about no first use of nuclear
weapons.83 This triggered international speculation that China had
changed its principled stand on this matter. In response to this, the
spokesman for China's Ministry of National Defense stated that "China
has repeatedly reiterated that it has always pursued the policy of
no-first-use of nuclear weap- ons, adhered to the nuclear strategy of
self-defense, and has not conducted any form of nuclear arms race with
any country, and this policy has never changed."84 **[The
[anti-separatism and pro-unification struggle]{.mark} over Taiwan [is a
long-term contest]{.mark} in grand strategy, not just a military one. In
this struggle, [China's]{.mark} nuclear [weapons play no direct
role]{.mark}, [unless the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [were
to use nuclear weapons against China first]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[China does not expect to resolve the issue of Taiwan with the use of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. **[Its leaders still believe that
winning hearts and minds will remain the factor that ultimately decides
this struggle]{.underline}**. Te Chinese government continues to
subscribe to the strategy of comprehensive using a variety of elements
of power at the level of grand strategy, engagement with the people of
Taiwan, modernization of China's national defense, containment of
Taiwanese separatist forces, and gradual shifting of the cross-strait
military balance in mainland China's favor.

#### Mo ev \-\-- wont use em first 

Te United States reserves the right to use nuclear weapons both against
countries that possess nuclear weapons and those that do not, in both
conventional and nuclear wars. China, by contrast, would only use
nuclear weapons against another nuclear-weapon state in a nuclear war,
and only in retaliation for a nuclear first strike. Tis is why China's
nuclear weapons would play no role in countering a potential Taiwanese
bid for independence, though they could have a role in the event of U.S.
military intervention if the United States were to use nuclear weapons
against China first. Te discussions about whether China should adopt a
policy of conditional no first use, abandon the principle of a few, or
attempt to deter conventional attacks with nuclear weapons all raise the
idea of expanding the role of nuclear weapons in China's national
security, in hopes that nuclear weapons could resolve more of the
country's national security issues. Tis would imply abandoning China's
nuclear strategy, which has been effective for decades, while also
creating greater economic burdens for China. In terms of international
politics, this would land China in a self-contradictory dilemma and in a
situation of passivity. As for strategic ideology, it would be
tantamount to seriously deviating from Mao's thinking on nuclear
strategy and would lead to the worship of nuclear weapons

accessed 7/10/19 \|\| OES-AT

[China threatened the U.S]{.underline}. on Tuesday [over a newly
approved \$2.2 billion American arms sale to Taiwan]{.underline}. ¶ Via
its Global Times propaganda outlet, [China posited that \"The U.S. and
Taiwan must not step out of line; otherwise, a price must be
paid.\"]{.underline} The article continued, \"We might as well make a
bold assumption. If an arms sale between the U.S. and Taiwan is not
acceptable to the Chinese mainland, if the latter announces it would
resolutely destroy the equipment once they are placed on the island,
what would happen?\" ¶ [Interestingly, the **Chinese government also**
used its article to **claim that the U.S. sale has no
threat-potential**]{.underline}. And that invites the question of why,
if China believe this sale doesn\'t significantly strengthen Taiwan\'s
defenses against prospective invasion, is Beijing also so aggravated?
First, because it\'s a lie. China knows this sale does indeed
effectively improve Taiwan\'s defense portfolio. Battle tanks, armored
vehicles, and man-portable Stinger anti-aircraft missiles, were
specifically chosen to contest Chinese military gaps in the early stages
of any invasion. [It\'s a common misconception that naval invasions are
now simple because we\'re in the 21st century or something. **China
knows that crossing the more than 80-mile Taiwan Strait will likely
entail taking major casualties from Taiwanese missile, artillery, naval,
and air forces**]{.underline} (especially if U.S. Navy submarines come
into play). ¶ In turn, [Chinese planners expect that the earliest
landing forces that do reach Taiwanese soil will have to fight without
effective air-ground support. This is where Taiwan knows it can
win:]{.underline} by using highly mobile forces to isolate and
annihilate pockets of landing troops. [While **China** would use its
mainland missile forces to wreak havoc on fixed Taiwanese positions such
as air bases and depots, it **would struggle to target mobile Taiwanese
forces**]{.underline}. That\'s where these new tanks and stingers come
in. [And if the Chinese advance force can\'t get off the beaches, well,
China has a big problem.]{.underline} ¶ Another issue is politics. China
is infuriated that President Trump is not blinking. At the recent G-20
summit in Japan, Trump acquiesced to Xi\'s demand that he allow U.S.
companies to sell goods to China\'s Huawei telecommunications
firm/intelligence service. Xi thus had reason to believe that Trump was
buckling in desperation to get a trade deal before the 2020 election.
This arms sale tells a different story. ¶ The U.S. remains committed to
restraining Beijing\'s aggressive expansionism. Prudent about Chinese
sensitivities over Taiwan, we should still support our democratic island
ally and refused to be cowed by Beijing\'s threats.

the Chinese [P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy [would
have to ship troops]{.mark} and equipment [across the Taiwan

would Taiwan's own tanks even factor into the fighting]{.underline}. ¶
[**An [invasion]{.mark} of Taiwan [would be a daunting challenge]{.mark}
for China**. [Beijing would have to win quickly]{.mark} or risk
political and military retaliation by the United States that could doom
the attack.]{.underline} Taipei's tanks merely must slow the Chinese
assault rather than totally reverse it. ¶ "Yes, the Taiwanese army
projects that it can only hold off its enemy for two weeks after the
landing," Tanner Greer noted in Foreign Policy, "but the PLA also
believes that if it cannot defeat the Taiwanese forces in under two
weeks, it will lose the war!" ¶ "[The [disparity between the military
budgets]{.mark} on both sides of the strait [is large]{.mark}, and
growing---[but the Taiwanese do not need parity to deter Chinese
aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline} All they need is the freedom to
purchase the sort of arms that make invasion unthinkable. If that
political battle can be resolved in the halls of Washington, the party
will not have the power to threaten battle on the shores of Taiwan."

### China Cant Take Taiwan

#### PLA doesn't have the capability to invade Taiwan

joined CNN in 2016. He writes about China, Australia and Indonesia, June
24^th^, 2019, "A Chinese invasion of Taiwan would be a bloody,

Roaring out of the sky, an F-16V fighter jet lands smoothly to rearm and
refuel on an unremarkable freeway in rural Taiwan, surrounded by rice
paddies. ¶ In different circumstances, this could be alarming sight.
Taiwan\'s fighter pilots are trained to land on freeways between sorties
in case all of the island\'s airports have been occupied or destroyed by
an invasion. ¶ Luckily, this was a training exercise. ¶ [There\'s only
really one enemy that Taiwan\'s armed forces are preparing to resist \--
China\'s People\'s Liberation Army (PLA).]{.underline} And as China\'s
reputation as an economic and military superpower has grown in recent
years, so too has that threat of invasion, according to security
experts. ¶ Taiwan has been self-governed since separating from China at
the end of a brutal civil war in 1949, but Beijing has never given up
hope of reuniting with what it considers a renegade province. ¶ At a
regional security conference in June, Chinese Defense Minister Wei
Fenghe said: \"[If anyone dares to split Taiwan from China, the Chinese
military has no choice but to fight at all costs for national
unity.\"]{.underline} In some shops in mainland China, you can buy
postcards and T-shirts emblazoned with patriotic emblems promoting the
retaking of Taiwan. ¶ But for seven decades, **[[China]{.mark} has
[resisted attacking Taiwan]{.mark} partly [for political
reasons]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} the prospect of a US [intervention
and]{.mark} the potential heavy [human toll]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But
the [[practical realities]{.mark} of a full-blown invasion [are also
daunting]{.mark} for the PLA, according to experts]{.underline}. ¶
Ferrying hundreds of thousands of troops across the narrow Taiwan Strait
to a handful of reliable landing beaches, in the face of fierce
resistance, is a harrowing prospect. [[Troops would]{.mark} then [have a
long slog over Taiwan\'s]{.mark} western [mudflats and mountains]{.mark}
to reach the capital, Taipei.]{.underline} ¶ Not only that, but [China
would face an opponent who has been preparing for war for almost 70
years]{.underline}. ¶ At mass anti-invasion drills in May, Taiwan
military spokesman Maj. Gen. Chen Chung-Chi said the island knew it had
to always be \"combat-ready.\" ¶ \"Of course, we don\'t want war, but
only by gaining our own strength can we defend ourselves,\" he said.
\"If China wants to take any action against us, it has to consider
paying a painful price.\" ¶ Difficult and bloody ¶ [[It could be easy to
assume]{.mark} that any [invasion]{.mark} of Taiwan by Beijing [would be
brief]{.mark} and devastating for Taipei]{.underline}: a David and
Goliath fight between a tiny island and the mainland\'s military might,
population and wealth. ¶ With nearly 1.4 billion people, the People\'s
Republic of China has the largest population in the world. Taiwan has
fewer than 24 million people \-- a similar number to Australia. China
has the fifth largest territory in the world, while Taiwan is the size
of Denmark or the US state of Maryland. And Beijing runs an economy that
is second only to the United States, while Taiwan\'s doesn\'t rank in
the world\'s top 20. ¶ But perhaps most pertinently, China has been
building and modernizing its military at an unprecedented rate, while
Taiwan relies on moderate US arms sales. ¶ In sheer size, the PLA simply
dwarfs Taiwan\'s military. ¶ China has an estimated 1 million troops,
almost 6,000 tanks, 1,500 fighter jets and 33 navy destroyers, according
to the latest US Defense Department report. Taiwan\'s ground force
troops barely number 150,000 and are backed by 800 tanks and about 350
fighter aircraft, the report found, while its navy fields only four
destroyer-class ships. ¶ Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the PLA has
rapidly modernized, buoyed by rises in military spending and crackdowns
on corruption in the army\'s leadership. ¶ \"China\'s leaders hope that
possessing these military capabilities will deter pro-independence moves
by Taiwan or, should deterrence fail, will permit a range of tailored
military options against Taiwan and potential third-party military
intervention,\" according to a 2019 US Defense Intelligence Agency
report on China\'s military. ¶ [[Yet]{.mark} while China hawks in the
media might beat the drum of invasion, [an internal China military
study]{.mark}, seen by CNN, [revealed that the **PLA considers an
invasion of Taiwan to be extremely difficult**]{.mark}]{.underline}. ¶
\"[Taiwan has a professional military, with a strong core of
American-trained experts,\"]{.underline} said Ian Easton, author of
\"The Chinese Invasion Threat\" and research fellow at the Project 2049
Institute, as well as \"highly defensible\" terrain. ¶ In his book he
described an invasion by China as \"the most difficult and bloody
mission facing the Chinese military.\" ¶ The plan to take Taiwan ¶
China\'s Taiwan invasion plan, known internally as the \"Joint Island
Attack Campaign,\" would begin with a mass, coordinated bombing of
Taiwan\'s vital infrastructure \-- ports and airfields \-- to cripple
the island\'s military ahead of an amphibious invasion, according to
both Easton and Sidharth Kaushal, a research fellow at the Royal United
Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies. ¶ At the same time,
the Chinese air force would fly over the Taiwan Strait and try to
dominate the island\'s air space. Once the PLA was satisfied it had
suitably disabled Taiwan\'s air and naval forces, Kaushal said soldiers
would begin to invade on the west coast of the island. ¶ The island\'s
rocky, mountainous east coast is considered too inhospitable and far
from mainland China. ¶ The amphibious invasion needed to put troops on
Taiwan, however, could be the biggest hurdle facing the PLA. ¶ In its
2019 report to Congress, the US Department of Defense said China \--
which has one of the largest navies in Asia \-- had at its command 37
amphibious transport docks and 22 smaller landing ships, as well as any
civilian vessels Beijing could enlist. ¶ That might be enough to occupy
smaller islands, such as those in the South China Sea, but [an
[amphibious assault]{.mark} on Taiwan [would]{.mark} likely [require a
bigger arsena]{.mark}]{.underline}[l]{.mark} \-- and there is \"no
indication China is significantly expanding its landing ship force,\"
the report said. ¶ That makes it vital for Beijing to neutralize
Taiwan\'s navy and air force in the early stages of an attack, Kaushal
said. ¶ \"The Taiwanese air force would have to sink around 40% of the
amphibious landing forces of the PLA in order to render this sort of
mission infeasible,\" he said. ¶ Essentially, that\'s only about 10 to
15 ships, he added. ¶ If they did make it across the strait, [the PLA
would still need to find a decent landing spot for its
ships]{.underline}. ¶ China\'s military would be looking for a landing
site both close to the mainland, and a strategic city, such as Taipei,
with nearby port and airport facilities. ¶ That leaves just 14 potential
beaches, Easton said \-- and it\'s not only the PLA that knows it.
Taiwanese engineers have spent decades digging tunnels and bunkers in
potential landing zones along the coast. ¶ Furthermore, [the [backbone
of Taiwan\'s defense is a fleet of vessels capable of launching]{.mark}
[anti-ship cruise]{.mark} [missiles]{.mark}, on top of an array of
ground-based missiles, and substantial mines and artillery on the
coastline.]{.underline} ¶ \"Taiwan\'s entire national defense strategy,
including its war plans, are specifically targeted at defeating a PLA
invasion,\" Easton said. ¶ Chinese troops could be dropped in from the
air, but a lack of paratroopers in the PLA makes it unlikely. ¶ [If the
[PLA]{.mark} held a position on Taiwan, and [could reinforce]{.mark}
with troops from the mainland [to face off]{.mark} about [150,000 Taiwan
troops]{.mark}, as]{.underline} well as more than 2.5 million
reservists, it would have to push through the island\'s western mud
flats and mountains, with only narrow roads to assist them, towards
Taipei. ¶ Finally, the mobilization of amphibious landing vessels,
ballistic missile launchers, fighters and bombers, as well as hundreds
of thousands of troops, would give Taiwan plenty of advance warning of
any attack, Kaushal said. ¶ \"It\'s extremely unlikely that the invasion
could come as a bolt from the blue,\" Kaushal added. ¶ There is, of
course, [one final deterrent to any PLA invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}.
¶ It isn\'t clear whether or not such an attack by China would spark an
intervention by the United States on Taipei\'s behalf. ¶ Washington has
been a longtime ally of the island, selling weapons to the Taiwan
government and providing implicit military protection from Beijing. ¶
Easton said that, at present, the US would likely intervene in Taiwan\'s
favor, both to protect investment by US companies on the island and
reassure American allies in the region, who are also facing down a
resurgent PLA in the East and South China seas. ¶ Collin Koh Swee Lean,
research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies\'
Maritime Security Program in Singapore, said there would also be
\"immense political consequences\" from taking over Taiwan, in the event
of a successful China invasion. ¶ \"It will likely mean that China will
be seen as the bad guy in the neighborhood, who uses force,\" he said.
\"It will alienate some regional partners and the good will which China
has been trying to build over the years will evaporate. And it will set
China on a collision course with the US.\" ¶ But Taipei isn\'t taking
anything for granted. ¶ On the sidelines of the massive Han Guang
drills, Taiwan\'s Maj. Gen. Chen pointed out the hundreds of spectators
who had come out to watch and support the island\'s military. ¶ \"These
exercises let people know the national army of the Republic of China is
ready,\" he said. ¶ Taiwan is taking no chances.

### No War: No Backlash

#### current arms sales to Taiwan don't anger China enough for them to attack

Jesse **Johnson 7/9** is a News Desk Manager and Staff Writer at the
Japan Times, July 9^th^, 2019, ["\$2.2 billion Taiwan-U.S. arms deal
angers China, but sale more symbolic than signal of
strengt]{.underline}h" from

The U.S. State Department's approval of a possible sale to Taiwan of
"big ticket" weapons at an estimated value of [\$2.2 billion is likely
to be seen as a symbolic move]{.underline} that makes sense for both
Taipei and Washington as they grapple with an increasingly assertive
China. ¶ The sale of the weapons requested by Taiwan, including 108
General Dynamics Corp. M1A2T Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles,
"will not alter the basic military balance in the region," the
Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement
released Monday. ¶ The DSCA notified U.S. Congress the same day of the
impending arms sale, which it said could also include mounted machine
guns, ammunition, Hercules armored vehicles for recovering inoperative
tanks, heavy equipment transporters, as well as related support. ¶ The
proposed tank sale "will contribute to the modernization of the
recipient's main battle tank fleet, enhancing its ability to meet
current and future regional threats and to strengthen its homeland
defense," the DSCA said. ¶ And the missiles would "support the foreign
policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve
the security and defensive capability of the recipient, an important
force for political stability, military balance, and economic progress
in the region," it added. ¶ In terms of troop numbers and firepower,
Taiwan would be a massive underdog in any war with China, with much of
its equipment in dire need of upgrades. In May, the Pentagon's Defense
Intelligence Agency warned in a report that Taiwan's traditional
military advantages over Beijing in the event of a cross-strait conflict
were eroding in the face of China's military modernization efforts. ¶
Its current tank force consists of around 1,000 CM 11 Brave Tiger and
M60A3 tanks, technology that is increasingly obsolete. [The Abrams tanks
and anti-aircraft missiles can be quickly moved by soldiers in the
field, significantly boosting Taiwan's ability to destroy Chinese armor
and warplanes in the event of an invasion]{.underline}. ¶ U.S. lawmakers
have 30 days to object to the sale, but are unlikely to do so. ¶ The
U.S. has no formal ties with self-governed and democratic Taiwan, which
Beijing views as a renegade province that must be brought back into the
fold --- by force if necessary --- but is bound by its Taiwan Relations
Act to help it defend itself and is the island's main source of arms.
The Pentagon says Washington has sold Taipei more than \$15 billion in
weaponry since 2010. ¶ The deal was going ahead despite Chinese
criticism, but also comes amid the protracted trade war and between the
U.S. and China and what Washington says is Beijing's militarization of
the disputed South China Sea. ¶ China's Foreign Ministry protested the
move Tuesday, expressing "strong dissatisfaction and steadfast
opposition" to the possible arms sale. ¶ Additionally, Taiwan in late
February also requested 66 F-16V fighter jets from the United States,
and in April, Washington approved a \$500 million package that included
F-16 parts and training. It was not clear if the fighter sale would be
approved, but experts said such a move would deal a political shock to
China. ¶ After the approval, Taiwan's Presidential Office expressed its
"heartfelt thanks" to the U.S. government for the arms sale, while
President Tsai Ing-wen said on Twitter that Taipei would continue to
"defend democracy." ¶ "Pleased that the #US government has approved
another arms sale package, boosting #Taiwan's self-defense
capabilities," she wrote. "We'll continue to speed up investment in
national defense, & partner with like-minded countries to defend
democracy while promoting regional peace and stability." ¶ The approval
came as Tsai prepares for a visit later this month to Taiwan's Caribbean
diplomatic allies, and will be bookended by a total of four nights in
the United States. Taiwanese media reported that the trip could include
a rare visit to New York. ¶ Derek Grossman, a senior defense analyst at
California-based Rand Corp. think tank, said that the sale could prove a
boon for both Taipei and Washington. ¶ "I think the sale should be
viewed [mostly through a symbolic lens for Taiwan]{.underline},"
Grossman said. "Basically, any big ticket item --- even in this case one
that is unnecessary, in my view --- will highlight Taipei's ability to
leverage its unique bilateral relationship with Washington to bolster
defense." ¶ As for Washington, [Grossman said the **deal "is a low-risk
way of keeping arms sales momentum going without** unnecessarily
**angering Beijing**]{.underline}." ¶ He said Beijing would likely
reason that tanks won't appreciably change the balance of power across
the Taiwan Strait, and were instead a demonstration of Washington
"treading lightly" as the White House seeks a trade deal with China and
continues to need Chinese aid on the North Korean nuclear issue. ¶ The
weapons sale will also console Tokyo as it grows increasingly wary of
China's growing military assertiveness, especially near the contested
Senkaku Islands, which are controlled by Tokyo but also claimed by
Beijing, where they are known as the Diaoyus. ¶ "Japan should take
solace in the fact that U.S.-Taiwan defense ties remain active ... and
strong --- actually the strongest since 1979," he said. "That is a good
sign for countering Chinese aggression against" Taipei and Tokyo.

[Taiwan will inaugurate a new president]{.underline} this week who China
hates but America should love. On May 20 Taiwan's newly elected
president, [Tsai Ing-wen, will come into office amidst a storm of
controversy]{.underline} and scandal. She will then begin a long hard
slog through a cross-Strait political minefield, alienated from the
world and increasingly unpopular at home. That is, if China's communist
government has its way. In recent weeks the People's Republic of China
([PRC) has raised tensions across the Taiwan Strait ahead of Taipei's
change of government, using a vast array of messaging channels to blame
the incoming Tsai for the troubles]{.underline}. **[Nothing could be
farther from the truth―Tsai has a moderate and low-key approach to
politics]{.underline}**. But that's beside the point. In the foreign
policy world perceptions matter far more than reality. [China's playbook
will be to brand Tsai as a problem]{.underline} and drive a wedge
between her and the international community. [The actual problem is that
the PRC wants to subvert Taiwan's government and annex the
island]{.underline}. China euphemistically calls this "reunification,"
and has not given up the use of force to achieve it. [The Communist
Party is deeply insecure and views Taiwan as a threat to its
legitimacy.]{.underline} Taiwan is a prosperous, vibrant democracy whose
continued success undermines Beijing's revanchist desire to secure
absolute control over its maritime periphery. The outgoing president, Ma
Ying-jeou, embraced the "One China" principle and paved the way for a
flood of cross-Strait exchanges in his eight years in office. He is an
expert on maritime and legal issues, but nonetheless sometimes acted in
ways that complimented the PRC narrative in the East China Sea and South
China Sea. Ma's policies were not intended to serve Beijing's interests.
He is an anti-communist and a strong advocate for the Republic of China
(ROC), the official title of Taiwan's government. Ma even went so far as
to suggest Taiwan has the right to claim all of mainland China's
territory because the PRC is an illegitimate government. [Ma's
well-intentioned "One China" ideology enabled cross-Strait dialogues
which produced over 20 trade agreements]{.underline}. These deals
enjoyed the support of the majority of Taiwanese people, especially
early on. [Yet his approach eventually fell out of step with the surging
tide of Taiwanese identity in his country]{.underline}. Approximately 84
percent of people in Taiwan now self-identify at Taiwanese (instead of
Chinese) and view cross-Strait ties as relations between two separate
countries. Increased Taiwanese familiarity with China since 2008 has
only bred contempt. Nor did China return Ma's gestures of goodwill. The
buildup of ballistic missiles and other offensive weapons aimed at
Taiwan continued apace throughout his administration. Taiwan's ability
to participate in the international community has been further
restricted. And unfettered trade with China, instead of strengthening
Taiwan's economy, only made it more vulnerable. [The newly-minted
President Tsai will take a different tack. She has no interest in
putting her political capital into an account that yields no interest
and allows for no withdrawals]{.underline}. Recent history demonstrates
that investing in China instead of other more profitable relationships
would be a costly mistake. [While cross-Strait relations will continue
to be important, Tsai is likely to focus her foremost energies on
economic and military reforms at home]{.underline}, while strengthening
partnerships with the United States, Japan, Australia, India, and other
democracies abroad. From the U.S. perspective, her presidency could not
have come at a better time. The United States and China are now firmly
entrenched in a competition for dominance over the Pacific Rim, and
Taiwan is a center of gravity. The island is located in the world's
busiest maritime and air routes, and it serves as a defensive barrier
for keeping Chinese naval power in check. The United States does not
covet Taiwan as a base for its military, but it does require that the
island remain in the hands of a friendly government. If Taiwan were
lost, other Asian allies could be held at risk by the threat of Chinese
blockades. As such, any PRC attempt to gain control of Taiwan would most
likely be regarded as an attack on the vital interests of the United
States, and repelled by any means necessary, including military force.
Taiwan is critical to the United States not only for its location, but
also for its shared values and its position as a key trading partner.
Taiwan is currently the United States' ninth largest trading partner,
ahead of Saudi Arabia, India, and Brazil. Experience has shown senior
U.S. policymakers that nations that share democratic values are the best
partners and worth defending. Common values generate common interests,
which are the basis for making a common cause in addressing global
challenges. Unfortunately some American 'China Hands' have been
advocating peace in the Taiwan Strait at any price and seeing crisis
where they should be seeing opportunity. They have been urging Tsai to
come up with a new "One China" formula to appease China. That would be a
mistake. Better to have the old flashpoint return than to see Taiwan
fall into China's orbit. Going forward, Taiwan deserves the
full-throated support of the U.S. government and all the material help
the United States can give a fellow democracy in peril. If Washington
stays complacent in the weeks and months ahead it will telegraph
complicit agreement with China's false assertions that Tsai is a
troublemaker. Bowing to Chinese coercion would forsake the
democratically represented will of Taiwan's citizenry. **[Tsai is a cool
and calculating centrist.]{.underline}** **[The greatest risk she
presents is not that she will be a 'pro-independence' firebrand, but
rather that she will be too cautious and slow to embrace strategies and
initiatives needed for helping compete with China]{.underline}**. Now
more than ever, the United States needs strong friends in the Pacific
who know how to play hardball. If Washington can convince Tsai that
America has the backbone to stand up to China, Taiwan will be right at
our side with an immense ability to contribute more to the common good.
[The coming political transition in Taipei is a strategic opportunity,
not a crisis. It should be treated as such by all but
Beijing.]{.underline}

### No War: China Wont Invade 

#### China wouldn't invade Taiwan -- Taiwan has the capacity to defend themselves

Mark **Episkopos '19** is a frequent contributor to The National
Interest and serves as research assistant at the Center for the National
Interest. Mark is also a PhD student in History at American University,
June 1^st^, 2019, "Could Taiwan Halt an Invasion by China?" from
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/could-taiwan-halt-invasion-china-60617,
accessed 7/5/19 \|\| OES-AT

The Taiwan question has long been in a thorn in the Chinese Communist
Party's (CCP) side. In the decades following the Shanghai communiqué,
the CCP's core strategic approach to Taiwan was to bide their time while
building up national strength. As Deng Xiaoping famously proclaimed, the
People's Republic of China (PRC) can wait 100 years to reunify with
Taiwan (also known as Republic of China, or ROC) if necessary. ¶ Today's
CCP appears to be operating within a much shorter time frame, however.
With China's rise to great power status, Beijing wields unprecedented
economic leverage over Taiwan and is increasingly comfortable with
flexing its military muscle overseas. XI Jingping is "losing patience"
with the defiant island off his southeastern coast, which continues to
rebuff Chinese reunification schemes premised on what Xi calls a "one
country, two systems" approach. ¶ [It is **unlikely that the CCP** would
**seek an outright invasion and occupation of Taiwan**, given the
drastic geopolitical risks that would entail.]{.underline} But as East
Asia scholars have frequently cautioned, the [China-Taiwan relationship
is fraught with potential escalatory spirals that can easily set the two
sides on a path to unavoidable military conflict]{.underline}. ¶ What
are Taiwan's military capabilities, and how would it defend itself
against a Chinese offensive? Here is what we found. ¶ [Taiwan's capacity
to defend its airspace against the might of the Chinese People's
Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is one of the foremost deciding
factors in a prospective military conflict.]{.underline} For most of the
20th century, Taiwan's security establishment was confident that the
superior training and equipment of the ROC air force was enough to
offset the PLAAF's vast numerical advantage. In 2019, those calculations
no longer apply. The PLAAF has emerged from its 1980's modernization
program with one of the most technically advanced air force rosters in
the world, supplementing a growing domestic jet fighter industry with a
total sum of just under one hundred modernized Russian Su-30MKK and
Su-35 fighters. ¶ [Meanwhile, the core of Taiwan's fleet is still
composed of US-made F-16A/B fighters that were procured in the
1990's.]{.underline} Since then, Taipei attempted several times to
purchase upgraded F-16 C/D Block fighters. The Pentagon demurred until
2011, when it instead offered a minor retrofit package for Taiwan's
fleet of aging F-16A/B jets. Even this watered-down contract sputtered
and eventually ground to a halt amid cost concerns. Taipei then briefly
turned its sights on procuring the F-35B, before concluding that the US
fighter was cost-inefficient and ill-suited for Taiwan's defense needs.
¶ [It is only in the past year that **Taipei found a glimmer of hope**
on their decades-long quest to modernize the Taiwanese air force. As per
a 330 million dollar contract signed in late 2018 and reconfirmed last
month, the preponderance of Taiwan's F-16A/B fleet will be retrofitted
to become generation 4.5 F-16 Vipers]{.underline}. As opposed to the
ill-fated F-16 C/D deal, the F-16V upgrade promises to be a serious
technical leap forward for Taiwan's air force. [The Viper boasts the
best avionics package ever seen on an F-16, while incorporating the
expanded armament suites of more recent F-16 Block
revisions]{.underline}. ¶ For the first time in well over a decade,
[Taiwan's air force would be in a military position to at least contest
Taiwanese airspace against the PLAAF's J-10 and Su-30
fighters.]{.underline} There is, however, a large caveat: the F-16V deal
is not set in stone. Just as rapidly as Taiwan's military fortunes are
rising on the heels of a deteriorating US-China relationship, so too can
they suddenly collapse with a change in Washington's geopolitical
priorities.

### Independence Turn

#### And, removing arms sales wont cause re-unification -- will make conflict MORE likely -- nationalism drives Taiwanese desire for independence 

**Roy '12**

**(Denny, "Why the U.S. shouldn\'t abandon Taiwan," pg online @
http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/06/why-the-u-s-shouldnt-abandon-taiwan/
//um-ef)**

Advocates of abandoning Taiwan may erroneously believe that halting U.S.
military and diplomatic support for Taipei would reduce tensions in East
Asia. This is certainly what Beijing would have us believe. According to
Chinese officials and commentators, U.S. assistance to Taipei is all
that stands in the way of peaceful unification, and without it the
people of Taiwan would stop resisting and accept Beijing's terms for
unification. This premise, however, ignores an important reality: the
main obstacle to unification is not U.S. arms sales, but rather
Taiwanese nationalism and the wish of nearly all Taiwan's people not to
be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. Thus, withdrawal of U.S.
support would not necessarily lead to a peaceful resolution of the
cross-Strait imbroglio. The opposite outcome is at least as likely.
Deterrence against an attack by the People's Liberation Army would be
weakened, while Taiwan's people may well choose to fight rather than
capitulate.

## Relations Advantage

#### The aff fails -- laundry list of reasons.

[Proposals to scale back US security ties to Taiwan are
controversial]{.underline}, however, and several scholars have written
thoughtful critiques of the idea. These critiques have generally made a
few key points. First, [it is not self-evident that ending security ties
with Taiwan would]{.underline} in fact [transform the US-China
relationship]{.underline}: [the interests of the two countries arguably
clash on many **other issues**]{.underline} (**[North
Korea]{.underline}**, **[maritime disputes]{.underline}** in East Asia,
**[economic issues]{.underline}**), [and it is unclear why Beijing would
yield on these]{.underline} other [issues]{.underline} [if]{.underline}
only [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [were to adopt a
policy on arms sales that]{.underline}---from Beijing's vantage---[the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [had already committed to
follow in the 1982 joint communiqué]{.underline}. Second, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' **[reputation]{.underline}**
[in the region could be at stake]{.underline}. Some worry that [walking
away from a commitment to Taiwan would send a **troubling signal** to
other US allies in East Asia]{.underline}. [Beijing might]{.underline}
likewise [view US concessions on Taiwan as a sign of
**weakness**]{.underline} [and conclude that Washington was
**unlikely**]{.underline} [to challenge the PRC]{.underline} [on **other
issues**]{.underline} in the region. Third, [ending arms
sales]{.underline}---[because it]{.underline} [would add to Taiwan's
**sense of insecurity**]{.underline}---[could]{.underline} actually
[make Taipei **more hesitant** about entering into sensitive political
talks with the PRC]{.underline}; [thus it isn't clear that a reduced US
commitment]{.underline} to Taiwan [would facilitate a peaceful
resolution]{.underline} to the dispute. Finally, and relatedly, [ending
arms sales would likely undercut Taiwan's **deterrent
capabilities**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} in turn [could
encourage a more coercive PRC approach]{.underline} to the island.

#### Cooperation doesn't spill-over and concessions don't work -- don't assume U.S. allies and Chinese strategic interests

**Jackson '15** Van Jackson, 8/6/2015. Visiting Fellow at the Center for
a New American Security and a Council on Foreign Relations International
Affairs Fellow. "The Myth of a US-China Grand Bargain," The Diplomat,
http://thediplomat.com/2015/08/the-myth-of-a-us-china-grand-bargain/.

[A number of scholars have tried to advance the well-intentioned
proposal that U.S. concessions to China's many concerns will somehow
facilitate a **peaceful order in Asia**]{.underline}. While I agree with
the sentiment and recognize that there are areas of international life
where Sino-U.S. cooperation is essential, [the idea that U.S.
accommodation of China **will produce a peaceful and stable order in
Asia isn't just unrealistic; it's irresponsible.**]{.underline} Though
it wasn't the first, Hugh White's China Choice was an early and pointed
call for the United States to form a "G-2" with China in which the two
countries would work together to set the terms of the regional order,
requiring that the United States accommodate the demands of a rising
China. Jim Steinberg's and Michael O'Hanlon's Strategic Reassurance and
Resolve reiterates many of White's points, but with better theoretical
grounding. Lyle Goldstein's Meeting China Halfway argues far more
persuasively than many in this lineage, and some of his specific
recommendations merit serious consideration---not least because they
would incur no great cost to try. But there are equally serious reasons
to doubt the transformative ambitions attached to U.S. concessions. The
latest salvo in this "America must accommodate China" literature hails
from an accomplished political scientist at George Washington
University, Charles [Glaser]{.underline}, writing in the most recent
issue of International Security. Glaser [makes the sweeping and somewhat
unhelpful claim that military competition is risky and therefore
undesirable]{.underline}. [As an alternative he suggests that if only
the **U**nited **S**tates would abandon commitments to **Taiwan**, China
would be willing to resolve its territorial disputes in the East and
South China Sea]{.underline}, thereby sidestepping military competition.
[Prior to around 2008, proposals for U.S. accommodation of a rising
China made **much more sense**, or at least could be taken more
seriously]{.underline}. [But **times have changed**. **China's ambitions
have changed**]{.underline}. And so has its foreign policy behavior.
These contextual changes matter for whether and when accommodation can
have the desired effect. More to the point though, [there are a number
of problems with the grand bargain line of argumentation]{.underline}.
First, [any proposal for a Sino-U.S. solution to regional problems is by
definition taking a great power view of Asia that marginalizes **the
agency and strategic relevance of U.S. allies** and the region's middle
powers]{.underline}. In the brief period (five to ten years ago) when a
G-2 concept was taken semi-seriously in Washington, allies---especially
South Korea and Japan---chafed. [The region's middle powers would be
**unlikely to simply follow the joint dictates of China** and the
**U**nited **S**tates **without being part of it,**]{.underline} and
attempting a G-2 could ironically create a more fragmented order as a
result. Including others, at any rate, is antithetical to the concept of
a Sino-U.S. G-2 arrangement. As early as the 1960s U.S. officials tried
to rely on China to deal with regional issues spanning from North Korea
to Vietnam. It was almost always to no avail. [Second]{.underline}, and
as I've written about extensively elsewhere, [**Asia is rife with
security concerns that have nothing to do with China** directly, so any
understanding reached with China would leave unresolved many of the
region's latent sources of potential conflict]{.underline}. [Sino-U.S.
grand bargain proponents forget that China and the United States only
have real conflicts of interest by proxy]{.underline}. Every conceivable
conflict scenario involves China and some other Asian state---Taiwan,
Japan, the Philippines, Korea. The United States only becomes part of
the picture because of a commitment to regional order, including its
alliance network. [Third, as its **recent stock market crash makes all
too obvious**, China remains a "fragile superpower]{.underline}," to
quote Susan Shirk. [Many factors in its domestic political
situation---corruption, growing wealth disparities, and many forms of
civil challenges to government legitimacy---make it an unpredictable
player]{.underline}. [Nor is China showing meaningful signs of political
liberalization]{.underline}. There's so much brewing underneath the
surface in China that dealing with China today as if it were a hegemon
tomorrow assumes too much, and grants China too much credit too soon.
[Fourth, **there's a defunct theory** that's been smuggled into
arguments about changing Chinese behavior through U.S.
accommodation]{.underline}. Political scientists call it
"neofunctionalism," a term rarely used these days, even though its
spirit is pervasive in grand bargain arguments. Neofunctionalism came
about in the 1950s as a failed way to account for and push for European
integration. [The basic idea involved an assumption that low level and
innocuous types of **cooperation would "spillover"** into still more and
better quality cooperation]{.underline}. Comity among nations, it was
thought, would be the eventual outcome of mundane socioeconomic
interactions. But by the 1970s, the theory had become largely
discredited. Nevertheless, echoes of neofunctionalism remain in
contemporary claims that properly calibrated restraint, accommodation,
or appeasement can have a transformative effect on a relationship.
Ironically, these arguments tend to come from scholars, not
policymakers. [The idea that the United States can induce China into
resolving its East and South China Sea disputes by "giving" it Taiwan
**reflects precisely this type of expectation**, as do calls for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to make small concessions to
China in hopes that it will enable a more stable situation]{.underline}.
None of this means that accommodative gestures or strategies should be
outright dismissed. There were numerous periods of detente with the
Soviet Union during the Cold War, and that rivalry was much more
confrontational. China and the United States, moreover, have a number of
overlapping---not just conflicting---interests. I might even go as far
as saying that neofunctionalism has a bit of a bad rap; there are times
when trivial or non-costly forms of cooperation can lead to greater and
deeper cooperation, but political scientists haven't convincingly
figured out what those conditions are. But [**grand bargains rarely
work**. There's a dangerous naivete in abandoning U.S. commitments on
the hope that China will then be more willing to resolve its other
disputes]{.underline}. And [policies of accommodation **will not suspend
military competition** because that involves more than present day
concerns with surveillance overflight missions, territorial disputes,
and current political commitments]{.underline}. [**Regardless of the
policy and crisis management decisions we make today, military
competition plays out over years and decades**; it relates to force
structure investment and doctrinal decisions that can't be sacrificed
for political promises]{.underline}.

Donald [Trump's shocking victory in the US presidential election has
upended all of the certainties]{.underline} that have shaped not only
American politics, but also how the world thinks about the United
States. [Trump must now confront the nitty-gritty of managing America's
international relationships]{.underline}, and arguably none is more
important for the world than that between [the US and
China]{.underline}. But it [is also the relationship that was put in the
most doubt by the tenor of Trump's campaign]{.underline}. **[The
president-elect could complicate bilateral relations]{.underline}**,
[particularly given that his first year in office will coincide with the
Chinese Communist Party's 19th National Congress next fall]{.underline}.
[In an ideal world, both Trump and]{.underline} Chinese President
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping [should want to keep US-China relations stable.
But this will prove difficult, given not only Trump's Sinophobic
rhetoric, but also ongoing disagreements about Chinese territorial
claims in the South China Sea and North Korea's nuclear
ambitions]{.underline}. **[Moreover, US-China relations could fall
victim to US domestic disputes about global trade, the value of the
dollar, and protectionism.]{.underline}** Many Chinese observers accept
that [Trump will have to grapple with unprecedented divisions at
home]{.underline}. He will be challenged not only by the now
shell-shocked Democrats, but also by Republicans who opposed his
candidacy, whether openly or covertly. Under these circumstances, [he
will have to emphasize putting America's own house in order. If,
however, he confuses such an effort with his campaign's "America first"
thrust, even more tension is likely]{.underline}.

#### Coop is inevitable REGARDLESS of whether or not relations are bad

(Wang, "New normal of China-US relations will not lead to
confrontation," pg online @ http://www.sino-us.com/419/20250393689.html

In terms of the current [China-US relations,]{.underline} many
[people]{.underline} are [focus]{.underline}ing [on competition between
the two nations. But]{.underline} what [we should rather pay attention
to]{.underline} is [coop]{.underline}eration [between the
two]{.underline} sides. The China-US **[relations will remain in a state

competition and even strategic confrontation between China and the US
over issues concerning South China Sea, Korean Peninsula, US sale of
weapons to Taiwan and so on]{.underline}, **[but
coop]{.underline}**eration [between the two sides **is also
increasing**]{.underline}. Local governments in the US and many
enterprises have shown growing interest in Chinese investment in the US.
Increase of investment may be affected by some political factors which,
however, are just partial from a long-term perspective. [China-US
coop]{.underline}eration [is still increasing on issues like climate
change and global governance,]{.underline} [as well as issues concerning
global security such as anti-terrorism in the Middle East and

[US-PRC Relations]{.underline}. The 16 December 2015 [[notification
**does not appear to have harmed US-PRC
relations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Following the announcement, PRC Taiwan
Affairs Office spokesman Ma Xiao-Guang stated, "we resolutely oppose
sales of weaponry or military technology to Taiwan by any country in any
form or using any excuse." The PRC also threatened to sanction the
American companies involved (Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and BAE);
however, [due to the standing prohibition on US weapons sales to the
PRC, none of these companies have large interests on the
Mainland]{.underline}. The [**[PRC did not sever]{.mark}**
[military]{.mark}-to-military [**relations** with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, as in 2008 and 2010, **[[and did not
cancel]{.mark} any high-level [meetings]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In fact,
President [[Obama and]{.mark}]{.underline} CCP General Secretary [[Xi
met]{.mark} just [three months after]{.mark} the notification to
Congress]{.underline} on 31 March 2016 [on the sidelines of the Nuclear
Security Summit in Washington, D.C.]{.underline} Additionally, **[[the
arms sale notification did not appear to hamper other areas of recent
US-PRC cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** including the 2014 US-PRC
agreement on climate change. On 31 March 2016, [both sides announced
that they would sign the Paris Climate Conference agreement in New York
on 22 April 2016]{.underline}. Conclusion. The 2015 notification of arms
sales to Taiwan did not substantially improve Taiwan's defensive
capabilities. The sale will not introduce any new systems to Taiwan. If
purchased, the items will increase Taiwan's war reserve stockpile, but
would not markedly improve Taiwan's defensive capability. Additionally,
[the announcement did not impact US-PRC relations. [PRC reactions were
subdued]{.mark}, [including standard statements of protest and
demarches]{.mark}, [but **no severance of**]{.mark}
**military-to-military [relations and no postponement of high-level
meetings]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Western media coverage of the sale
focused on the lack of "big ticket items," labeling the notification
"uncommonly modest" and offering "little offensive power." The
[four-year break in notifications from 21 September 2011 to 16 December
2015 was the longest period without a congressionally notified arms sale
to Taiwan since the severance of relations in 1979]{.underline}.
Additionally, despite the extended period between notifications, the
announced \$1.8 billion value was low compared to previous sales
notified in 2011 (\$5.3 billion), 2010 (\$6.4 billion), 2008 (\$6.4
billion), and 2007 (\$3.7 billion).

#### New bill [solves]{.underline} the Taiwan advantage and status quo relation are [too]{.underline} bad to improve relations.

**[Numerous former US officials have warned of a tense year ahead in
relations across the Taiwan Strait under an increasingly anti-China US
Congress and a whole-of-government approach advocating for closer US
ties with the self-ruled island.]{.underline}** They include [Susan
Thornton, a former top US diplomat for East Asian affairs, who is also
concerned that President Donald Trump may lack sufficient understanding
of the sensitivity of cross-strait relations, which could quickly become
a flashpoint in US-China relations if not handled properly. Their
alarming assessment follows the Trump administration's tacit approval of
Taipei's request to buy more than 60 F-16V fighter jets **-- a move
Beijing has described as "extremely dangerous"**]{.underline} -- and a
flurry of legislative and other support from the US for the island in
the past week. The activity in Washington comes hard on the heels of the
first participation by a US coastguard vessel in a 'freedom of
navigation' exercise conducted by the US in the Taiwan Strait. Last
Tuesday a bill was introduced in the US Senate requesting a government
review of its policy on Taiwan and an elevation of military ties with
Taipei. "Hardliners in the US are taking their political grandstanding
on Taiwan to new heights," said Thornton, who is now a senior fellow at
Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Centre, after retiring from her
diplomatic posting last July. ["I expect there will be continuing
defence sales but the legislation is dangerous and Trump has no
understanding of this issue,"]{.underline} she said. [If passed, the
Taiwan Assurance Act would mandate a review by the US president of the
State Department's guidelines on US-Taiwan relations and direct the
Defence Department to **include Taiwan in military training exercises,
as well as support arm sales to Taipei. US lawmakers introduce bill to
boost ties with Taiwan**]{.underline} The legislation echoes an appeal
for the US to revisit its one-China policy which was made by Trump's
national security adviser, John Bolton, in an opinion article published
by The ﻿Wall Street Journal in early 2017 before he joined the White
House. "**[The bill confirms that the Congress strongly supports Taiwan
politically, in part because the sentiment in Congress is fairly
anti-China]{.underline}**," said Richard Bush, a senior fellow at the
Washington-based Brookings Institution. He is a former chairman of the
American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto US embassy on the island.
However, Bush said that the bill's requirement of a Taiwan policy review
was "not unprecedented" and predicted the US government would regard the
other two items, aimed at furthering military ties, as "a clear
intrusion on the president's commander-in-chief powers and in effect
refuse to carry them out". Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen addressed a

Photo: Reuters Share: In a US House of Representatives hearing last
week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also vowed to take more action on
the Taiwan Travel Act, which was passed unanimously by Congress early
last year and permits high-level visits between Washington and Taipei.
Beijing has repeatedly warned Washington to stop any official contacts
and cut off all military ties with Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a
breakaway province to be taken back by force if necessary. Washington
has no formal ties with Taipei, but remains its major arms supplier and
is bound by law to help defend the island. Last week, Taiwan President
Tsai Ing-wen addressed a Heritage Foundation event in Washington, via a
live video link, on US-Taiwan and cross-strait relations. She is
scheduled to deliver a second, similar speech to the US Centre for
Strategic and International Studies on April 9, a day ahead of the 40th
anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act, the US law which has defined
its relations with the island since it switched sovereign recognition
from Taipei to Beijing in 1979. The message from Washington has been
alarming enough to prompt a former top White House official on Asian
affairs to heap scorn on the current Taiwan policymakers in the Trump
administration. "[In every corner of the \[current Trump\]
administration, the wrong people are calling the shots]{.underline},"
the former official said, on condition of anonymity due to the
sensitivity of the issue. "These guys think Beijing will just surrender
on trade, Taiwan and technology, whatever," the former official added.
Edwin Feulner, founder and former president of the Heritage Foundation,
an influential conservative Washington think tank, said that the US and
Taiwan should further their "special relationship with increased
practical cooperation", such as a bilateral US-Taiwan free-trade
agreement. "**[The Trump administration is more open to ways to
demonstrate American support than any other administration in recent
memory]{.underline}**," Feulner said. "**[Support in Congress for Taiwan
from both political parties is higher than it has been for more than 20
years]{.underline}**." Derek Grossman, a senior defence analyst at the
Rand Corporation, said that "clearly the Trump administration -- and,
quite significantly, the US Congress -- are fully on board with
bolstering US-Taiwan relations, to include in the defence domain".
Grossman said that Washington had been proceeding with a
"whole-of-government" approach to countering China in nearly every
dimension. "**[This is likely to include more frequent and
higher-calibre arms sales to Taiwan and further integration of the
island into Trump's Indo-Pacific strategy]{.underline}**," he said.

### Retal/Rels Drop

#### China will complain, but not act aggressively\-\--concerns will be shrugged off.

https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/07/10/china-demands-us-cancel-arms-sale-taiwan.html)//GA

[China demanded]{.underline} Tuesday [that the United States
\"immediately cancel\" a potential sale of \$2.2 billion in arms to
self-ruled Taiwan]{.underline}, including battle tanks and anti-aircraft
missiles, adding fuel to tensions between the two powers. **[The U.S.
later shrugged off China\'s complaints, responding that the equipment
would contribute to \"peace and stability\" in Asia]{.underline}**. [The
sale would be the first transfer of big-ticket U.S. military gear to the
democratically-governed island in decades]{.underline}, and comes as
ties between Washington and Beijing are already strained by their trade
war. China has lodged formal complaints through diplomatic channels
expressing \"[strong dissatisfaction and resolute
opposition]{.underline}\" [to the move]{.underline}, foreign ministry
spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing. The deal
includes 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks, 250 Stinger portable anti-aircraft
missiles, related equipment and support at an estimated cost of just
over \$2.2 billion, according to the U.S .Defense Security Cooperation
Agency (DSCA). The [proposed sale]{.underline} \"[will contribute to the
modernization of the recipient\'s main battle tank fleet]{.underline}\",
[improve its air defense system and]{.underline} \"[support the foreign
policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve
the security and defensive capability]{.underline} ([of
Taiwan]{.underline}),\" DSCA said. [It would not alter the \"basic
military balance in the region,\"]{.underline} the agency added, and
Congress has been notified. U.S. lawmakers have 30 days to object to the
sale but are unlikely to do so. Geng said the proposed deal \"seriously
violates the one-China principle\" and \"grossly interferes\" in the
country\'s internal affairs. \"China urges the U.S. to\... immediately
cancel the planned arms sale and stop military relations with Taipei to
avoid damaging Sino-US relations and harming peace and stability in the
Taiwan Strait,\" he said. [The State Department responded by saying the
transaction doesn\'t change US recognition of Beijing as China\'s sole
government]{.underline}. \"Our interest in Taiwan, especially as it
relates to these military sales, is to promote peace and stability
across the strait, across the region,\" spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus told
reporters. \"So **[there is no change of course in our longstanding
one-China policy]{.underline}**,\" she said.

violates international law and basic norms in international relations,
seriously breaches the one-China principle and the three China-U.S.

and harms China\'s sovereignty and security interests]{.underline}.\"
\"China deplores and resolutely opposes it. **[We have lodged stern

across the strait.

### Taiwan Not Key

#### Taiwan isn't key to overall relations

**Lingwall 14** (Noah Lingwall is a student at the Schreyer Honors
College of the Pennsylvania State University and an intern at the
Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College, The Diplomat,

Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2015/08/the-taiwan-problem-if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it/)SEM

[The recent debate surrounding Taiwan's role in a possible U.S.-China
"grand bargain" reveals that the controversy surrounding Taiwan's status
as a nation is alive and well]{.underline} in 2015. Led by George
Washington University professor Charles L. Glaser and his recent article
in International Security, a cadre of political scientists, policy
analysts, and pundits have amplified their calls for a groundbreaking
deal in which the United States would abandon Taiwan to China in
exchange for weighty Chinese concessions. Specifically, [Glaser
envisions a deal]{.underline} in which China vows greater docility in
dealing with territorial disputes and accepts U.S. regional hegemony [in
exchange for the United States' release of Taiwan]{.underline}.
[Glaser's argument rests upon three key assumptions: First, he assumes
that Taiwan acts as an impediment to U.S.-China relations. Second, he
assumes that Taiwan can serve as a "bargaining chip" in a high-stakes
U.S. gamble. Lastly, Glaser makes the assumption that the successful
negotiation of a grand bargain would induce steadfast Chinese
cooperation on key regional security issues.]{.underline} Unfortunately,
**[these assumptions are patently false]{.underline}**. By debunking the
myth of the "grand bargain," it becomes clear that [Washington's
abandonment of Taiwan would]{.underline} not only spell the end of a
delicate China-Taiwan equilibrium, it would also **[threaten the
stability of the entire East Asian security environment.]{.underline}**
Myth #1: Taiwan Is an Obstacle to Better U.S.-China Relations
[Glaser]{.underline} and others who espouse the benefits of a U.S.-China
grand bargain [allege that the unresolved question of Taiwanese
independence has impeded healthy U.S.-China relations]{.underline}. To
test this assertion, it is important to consider the reality of recent
China-Taiwan interactions. The issues of Taiwan's disputed status and
[U.S. arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline} remain perhaps the most
outstanding problems between the United States and China. Still, even
these issues [no longer impede U.S.-China relations]{.underline}. The
question of Taiwanese independence emerged in the 1990s with the
nation's transition to democracy. As the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) gained control over Taiwan in subsequent
elections, then-President Chen Shui-bian amplified Taiwan's calls for
independence. The 2005 passage of the Anti-Secession Law\* in China
served as a sharp response to Taiwan's ambitions for independence.
Meanwhile, former President George W. Bush clarified the U.S. position
of "[strategic ambiguity]{.underline}" over the Taiwan issue with a
powerful proclamation: The United States would not want to see Taiwan
provoke China, but the United States would help defend Taiwan if China
were to lose its patience with Taiwan and use force to achieve
unification with the island. This statement made it clear that the
United States did not support either formal Taiwanese independence or
forceful unification. This policy position [effectively stabilized the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Since then, no further attempts have
been made to upend the balance between China and Taiwan. Nor should U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan be regarded as a serious barrier]{.underline} to
U.S.-China relations. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 stipulates that
the United States will provide Taiwan with arms of a defense nature.
Although China often uses the United States' periodic decision to sell
arms to Taiwan as a political ploy to suspend the Chinese military's
contact with the United States and stir up nationalistic sentiments,
[the issue needs to be put into perspective]{.underline}. While all arms
are technically offensive in nature, [the quantity and quality of the
weapons Taiwan receives from the United States **do little Taiwan's
offensive capabilities**. For example, Taiwan purchases short-range
fighter jets, air defense systems, and older-generation
weapons.]{.underline} In addition, [U.S. authorization to sell arms to
Taiwan differs from the actual delivery of weapon systems]{.underline}.
The United States has declined to provide the quality of weapons that
Taiwan has requested from time to time. Moreover, Taiwan's legislature
has often failed to appropriate the funds necessary to purchase the
quantity of weapons requested. Finally, [China's periodic suspensions of
its military contacts with the United States have failed to inflict
significant damage on U.S.-China relations and **relations are regularly
quietly restored** once the political storm subsides. Beijing
understands that Taiwan's weaponry does not pose a serious threat to
mainland China's military.]{.underline} Bearing this in mind, it seems
evident that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan act as mere political pretense
for China's antagonistic behavior and are not serious obstacles. In
fact, [the past several decades have produced a **relatively stable
economic and political equilibrium** between China and
Taiwan]{.underline}. Most recently, the 2008 election of President Ma
Ying-jeou has ushered in an era of unprecedented China-Taiwan
cooperation. [Economic integration, highlighted by a 2010 bilateral
trade agreement, has inextricably linked Beijing and
Taipei]{.underline}. In fact, the health of [Taiwan's economy relies on
revenue from Chinese trade]{.underline}. According to 2014 Chinese
statistics, trade volume between the two nations totaled more than 200
billion dollars. Taiwan also exports most of its goods to China and
enjoys a huge trade surplus. Yearly trends indicate that the economic
bonds between the two nations are getting even stronger: From 2014 to
2015, trade between the two nations increased 16.7 per cent.

## Arms Control Advantage

### 1NC Frontline

#### Trump and Republicans hate arms control -- nothing about the aff would cause a flurry of new agreements to pass Congress

Bell and other proponents of arms control fear that [the [Trump]{.mark}
administration [will feel emboldened to scrap]{.mark}]{.underline} other
[[treaties]{.underline}, [particularly]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[New
START]{.underline}]{.mark}** agreement. Signed in 2011, the strategic
arms treaty limits the number of U.S. and Russian nuclear warheads and
delivery systems, and it is due to expire in early 2021 unless
Washington and Moscow agree to extend it. Most analysts are in agreement
that Russia is adhering to the New START treaty. Some **[[prominent
Republican]{.mark} [fo]{.mark}reign-[po]{.mark}licy
[experts]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [including top Trump
aides]{.underline}, [[have criticized that agreement as
one-sided]{.underline}]{.mark}. National Security Advisor John Bolton in
a 2010 Wall Street Journal op-ed described the treaty as "profoundly
misguided," while Trump in February 2017 called it a "bad deal." During
his press briefing on Friday, Pompeo dodged a question on the fate of
the New START deal but said "we're endeavoring to do everything we can
to ensure that the risks of proliferation that increase in these
massively destructive weapons systems is diminished." (Bell, the arms
control expert, noted that Pompeo mixed up the terms arms control and
nonproliferation. The former means reducing the number of weapons that
currently exist, while the latter refers to preventing future weapons
from being created.) Thomas [Countryman]{.underline}, a former career
diplomat who served as acting undersecretary of state for arms control
and international security until January 2017, [cited Bolton's
[opposition to other]{.mark} international [agreements such as]{.mark}
the [Iran]{.mark} nuclear deal and [the A]{.mark}nti-[B]{.mark}allistic
[M]{.mark}issile Treaty]{.underline}, another pact with Russia, which
the United States withdrew from in 2002. "[[Bolton has]{.mark} the same
[hostility toward New START]{.mark} historically [as he had
to]{.mark}ward all the [other]{.mark} international [agreements where he
has been the **primary assassin**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Countryman
said. "[You have to be concerned he will welcome any excuse not to

On the one hand, the US refusal to press for further nuclear arms
reductions and persist with general talk on the need for moving towards
a "nuclear-free world," which was most characteristic of the Obama
administration, consolidates strategic stability and removes one of the
main irritants in relations with [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
latter [[has declared time and again]{.mark} since 2010 that [it will
not accept new reductions in nuclear arms,]{.mark} including
non-strategic types, [in a changing strategic environment]{.mark} and
that [the New START Treaty is more likely to be the last
bilateral]{.mark} Russia-US "[grand treaty]{.mark}" on the limitation
and reduction of the nuclear arsenals]{.underline}. In fact,
[[given]{.mark} nuclear [prolife]{.mark}ration [and]{.mark} actual
nuclear multipolarity]{.underline}, improvements in antimissile defense
systems, new strategic functions of conventional weapons (the ability to
deliver a disarming strike at Russia or the US), [[the dynamic upgrading
of nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the conversion of cyber
technologies to weapons of mass destruction, [[any further cuts in
Russian and US nuclear arsenals]{.mark} alone [would have a highly
destabilizing effect]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Besides, [the comeback of a
global great-power]{.mark} [rivalry]{.mark} and the revival of the
US-Russia and US-China confrontation, which [has been correctly
reflected in]{.mark} the National Security Strategy, the National
Defense Strategy and the new US [nuclear doctrine, call for an
invigoration of containment]{.mark} in relations [between]{.mark} the
great powers, particularly the [nuclear powers]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
it is nuclear weapons that will remain the main means of containment.
Thus, this only increases the importance of nuclear weapons as a means
whereby to maintain containment and strengthen strategic stability
(which today is multilateral rather than bilateral as was the case
during the Cold War). The United States' recognition of this fact at the
doctrinaire level can only be welcomed.

### No Internal Link: China modernization inev

#### China inevitably modernizes nuclear technology

**Torode 5/2** -- (Greg, "Special Report: China\'s furtive underwater

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Recent visitors to the bay surrounding a submarine
base on the southern coast of China's Hainan Island describe a curious
nocturnal phenomenon. Powerful spotlights are sometimes trained directly
on the ocean frontages of neighboring hotels at night, making visibility
out to sea virtually impossible. Some of the lights are mounted on land
and others on passing naval patrol boats. "The effect is incredible,"
said one recent visitor. "The glare is so great you can hardly stand it
on the balcony. You go inside and draw the curtains tight." **[The
blinding lights cannot obscure something of intense interest to the
world's military intelligence agencies: evidence that [China has made a
breakthrough]{.mark} in its drive [to rival America]{.mark} and Russia
as a nuclear arms power.]{.underline}** Satellite imagery reveals the
regular presence of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines at the
strategic base near the resort city of Sanya. Specialized surface
warships and aircraft designed to protect the subs are prowling key
waterways off the coast. Facilities at the base appear to have been
built to store and load ballistic missiles. Antenna arrays that support
the hunt for foreign submarines have appeared on Chinese-held islands in
the hotly contested South China Sea. And a veteran submariner has been
appointed to command Chinese forces in the south of the country. Taken
together, this means **[[China]{.mark} has a force of missile submarines
that [can launch nuclear attacks from beneath the waves]{.mark} and now
appear to be heading out on patrols, according to serving and retired
naval officers, diplomats and security analysts. [That gives
Beijing]{.mark} something it has until recently lacked: [a]{.mark} more
[reliable]{.mark} "[second strike]{.mark}" [capability]{.mark} if its
land-based nuclear arsenal comes under attack. After six decades of
battling to master complex and challenging subsea military technologies,
China]{.underline}** has joined the United States, Russia, the United
Kingdom and **[France in the nuclear ballistic missile submarine
club]{.underline}**. In its most explicit assessment so far of this
Chinese capability, the Pentagon in its latest annual report on China's
military, published in August, said that Beijing now has a "credible"
and "viable" sea-based nuclear deterrent. **[An [effective fleet
of]{.mark} nuclear ballistic missile submarines, known as
[SSBNs]{.mark}, [marks a dramatic boost to China's]{.mark} nuclear
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Each of China's four Jin-class
submarines is armed with up to 12 ballistic missiles that can carry a
nuclear warhead with an estimated range of 7,200 kilometers (about 4,500
miles), according to the Pentagon. That would put the United States
within striking distance from the Western Pacific. Analysts at the
Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies estimate
these missiles could fly at least 8,000 kilometers. The U.S. believes
China has up to 100 nuclear missiles based on land. **[Beijing's
enhanced nuclear capability is one of the hallmarks of Chinese leader Xi
Jinping's ambitious revamping of the]{.underline}** People's Liberation
Army (**[PLA), the world's largest fighting force. [China's]{.mark}
nuclear submarine [fleet]{.mark}, Western strategists say, [has added to
the challenge that the]{.mark} increasingly powerful [Chinese military
poses]{.mark} to U.S. dominance in Asia.]{.underline}** "The opposing
side can never be exactly sure that it knows where all of the submarines
are," said Peter Horobin, a retired Australian submarine commander and
veteran of the Cold War battles to detect and monitor Soviet subs.
China's Ministry of National Defense, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and
the Pentagon did not respond to questions from Reuters. **[It is still
unclear if the Chinese are deploying fully armed submarines to maintain
a round-the-clock deterrent, as the other ballistic missile submarine
powers do.]{.underline}** Some analysts doubt China has advanced that
far. But the United States and its allies are behaving as if China has.
**[Western military [officials say]{.mark} privately [that]{.mark} in
operational terms, [America and its allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** -
including Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom - **[[are]{.mark}
already [attempting to track]{.mark} the [movements of China's
missile]{.mark} [sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark} as if they are fully armed
and on deterrence patrols.]{.underline}** Asked about their role in
tracking Chinese subs, Japan and the United Kingdom said they don't
comment on operational details.

#### China nuclearization is inevitable 

**Schneider 5/6** -- (Mark, "Why You Should Fear China\'s Nuclear
Weapons" National Interest, May 6, 2019,
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-you-should-fear-chinas-nuclear-weapons-56212>)//RP

In 2006, China said that it was "progressively improving its force
structure" of both nuclear and conventional missiles. This is exactly
what has happened. **[This expansion of Chinese nuclear capability has
occurred despite the fact that the U.S. drastically reduced its nuclear
capabilities]{.underline}** after 2001. China's nuclear buildup must be
viewed in the context of the largest and longest sustained military
buildup in the post-Cold War world. What is very significant is that
China began its military buildup after threats to China largely
evaporated at the end of the Cold War. China is extremely secretive
about its nuclear forces. In 1982, Mao's successor, Deng Xiaoping, said
that China should "...hide our capabilities and bide our time." This may
be a good description of Chinese policy when it comes to revealing its
nuclear capability. Its objective would appear to be to hide its
capabilities to achieve strategic surprise and minimize the risk of a
U.S. response to its nuclear buildup. However, it is noteworthy that the
Chinese state media and, to some extent, the Chinese government have
been more open in revealing China's nuclear capability for its
non-strategic systems. Despite Chinese secrecy, what is known is
troubling. **[Chinese nuclear expansion must be viewed against the
backdrop of Chinese territorial expansion in the South and East China
Seas and the overall growth of Chinese military
capability]{.underline}**. The Chinese government promotes strong
nationalism and communist ideology is still prevalent in the People's
Liberation Army (PLA). **[The Expansion of Chinese Strategic Nuclear
Forces]{.underline}** According to the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review,
**["China, too, is modernizing and expanding its already considerable
nuclear forces]{.underline}**. Like Russia, China is pursuing entirely
new nuclear capabilities tailored to achieve particular national
security objectives while also modernizing its conventional military,
challenging traditional U.S. military superiority in the Western
Pacific." Furthermore, the report says **[China]{.underline}**, like
Russia**[, has added: "...new types of nuclear capabilities to their
arsenals, increased the salience of nuclear forces in their strategies
and plans, and engaged in increasingly aggressive behavior, including in
outer space and cyberspace."]{.underline}** A 2017 National Institute
for Public Policy (NIPP) report points out, "The Obama Administration
estimated that **[China has several hundred nuclear weapons, but other
estimates place the number much higher]{.underline}**."\[6\] The high
estimates go up to several thousand. Irrespective of what the current
number is, there are indications of a major force expansion. The NIPP
report further noted, "**[The extensive length of China's 'Underground
Great Wall']{.underline}** (which the Chinese say is 5,000 km of deep
tunnels**[), suggests that a larger force of nuclear-armed ICBMs may be
planned."]{.underline}** In addition to protecting mobile ICBMs, these
tunnels provide a place to hide them. The implication of this extensive
network of deep tunnels for U.S. nuclear weapons requirements has been
largely ignored. While the Obama Administration stated we needed
"significant" counterforce capability, its subsequent programmatic
decisions went in the opposite direction. Some of this has been changed
by the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, but some of it has not. Thus, the
U.S.' ability to target these tunnels is limited because we have
inadequate capability to destroy hard and deeply buried targets and it
is actually declining. According to the 2019 Defense Intelligence Agency
report on "China Military Power", **["China is developing a new
generation of mobile missiles, with warheads consisting of multi­ple
independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs) and penetration
aids..."]{.underline}** Over the last decade, China has developed and
deployed new nuclear DF-31 and the DF-31A mobile ICBMs, a MIRVed version
of their DF-5 silo-based ICBM, the type 094 ballistic missile submarines
carrying JL-2 SLBMs and H-6J cruise missile-carrying bombers. The
reported range of the H-6J, 8,000-km, would make it a heavy bomber under
the New START Treaty range definition. Additionally, **[the Chinese J-20
air-launched cruise missile is nuclear capable]{.underline}**. Indeed,
in December 2013, a story in the Chinese state media talked about
China's H-6K bombers launching nuclear-armed cruise missiles against
U.S. bases in South Korea and Japan. China has displayed its new
reportedly MIRVed, DF-31AC a road-mobile solid-fuel ICBM at a military
parade. Chinese state media also recently indicated that the large
mobile heavily MIRVed DF-41 mobile ICBM is operational. The state-run
Global Times wrote that it would give China "respect." The DF-41 is
generally reported to carry 10 nuclear warheads. Moreover, China has
said it is developing a new nuclear-capable bomber, reportedly a stealth
design. **[The 2017 Pentagon report on Chinese military power says that
in the early 2020s China will likely begin the construction of new type
096 submarines which reportedly will carry the new JL-3
SLBM.]{.underline}** There are reports that the JL-3 will be MIRVed. A
2017 unclassified DIA report indicates China is now deploying "two, new
air-launched ballistic missiles, one of which may include a nuclear
payload." **[China's Theater Nuclear Capability]{.underline}** A 2017
unclassified National Air and Space Intelligence Center (NASIC) report
indicated there were 33 types of Chinese battlefield rockets,
theater-range ballistic and cruise missiles. Various unclassified U.S.
government reports have said the DF-26 IRBM, the DF-21 medium-range
missile, including the carrier killer DF-21D, the new cruise missiles,
China's hypersonic glide vehicles, and an air-launched ballistic missile
are nuclear capable. According to the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review
report, China's new DF-26 is "a nuclear-capable precision guided...
intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of attacking land and naval
targets." The U.S. does not have this capability. The Taiwanese Defense
Ministry has said that the DF-11 short-range ballistic missile is
nuclear capable. The new short-range Chinese DF-15 ballistic missile is
also reported to be nuclear capable. Russian experts credit much of
China's conventional missile force with dual capability (nuclear and
conventional). China has been testing hypersonic missiles for years. In
2018, Chinese state media claimed its hypersonic DF-17 boost-glide
vehicle, with a range of 1,000-1,500 miles, can sink carriers. Initial
operating capability for the DF-17 is reportedly expected in 2020. In
December 2018, China reportedly tested the Starry Sky 2 Mach 6 powered
hypersonic missile (it is also characterized as an aircraft, probably,
inaccurately) which is reported to be nuclear capable. Chinese Nuclear
Testing and the Development of New Types of Nuclear Weapons To modernize
its nuclear forces**[, China continued high-yield nuclear
testing]{.underline}** through 1996. The purpose of Chinese nuclear
tests in the 1990s was to "develop small, light warheads for the PRC's
new nuclear forces." According to declassified intelligence reports,
China's nuclear tests in the 1990s were mainly involved with the
development of new strategic and tactical nuclear weapons of advanced
design. Significantly, Chinese officials have said China has developed
new types of nuclear weapons after the end of the Cold War. Xue
Bencheng, reportedly one of the most important scientists involved in
the development of China's neutron bomb, stated that the July 1996
Chinese nuclear test was "a great spanning leap" because it solved the
problem of nuclear weapons miniaturization. The House of
Representatives' Cox Committee, which extensively investigated Chinese
theft of U.S. technology, concluded that, "If the PRC violates the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by testing surreptitiously, it could
further accelerate its nuclear development." It also concluded that
China "...may be testing low yield nuclear explosive devices underground
at its Lop Nur test site." In May 2006, Chinese Defense Today also
reported possible "low yield nuclear tests" after the declared end of
nuclear testing. Covert Chinese nuclear testing could enhance Chinese
capabilities to field advanced nuclear weapons. Writing in 2002, Russian
military journalists Vyacheslav Baskakov and Aleksandr Gorshkov
maintained that China "...will succeed in making the shift from its
current megaton-class nuclear ordinance to a level of hundreds and tens
of kilotons, thereby increasing the effectiveness of available forces
and weapons, flexibility of use in various circumstances and combat
situations on both a strategic and tactical level." Moreover, the Cox
Committee report stated: The People's Republic of China (PRC) has stolen
classified information on all of the United States' most advanced
thermonuclear warheads, and several of the associated reentry
vehicles.....The stolen U.S. secrets have helped the PRC fabricate and
successfully test modern strategic thermonuclear weapons. The stolen
information includes classified information on seven U.S. thermonuclear
warheads, including every currently deployed thermonuclear warhead in
the U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile arsenal. Together, these
include the W-88 Trident D-5 thermonuclear warhead, and the W-56
Minuteman II, the W-62 Minuteman III, the W-70 Lance, the W-76 Trident
C-4, the W-78 Minuteman III Mark 12A, and the W-87 Peacekeeper
thermonuclear warheads. The stolen information also includes classified
design information for an enhanced radiation weapon (commonly known as
the 'neutron bomb').... What this means, as the Cox Committee pointed
out, is that the stolen U.S. information and computer codes make it much
easier for China to replicate the most advanced U.S. Cold War designs,
including types that we unwisely eliminated at the end of the Cold War.
This enhances the threat potential of reported covert Chinese nuclear
testing.

As the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) shapes itself into a
"world-class force," it is also modernizing its nuclear weapons
stockpile. Keeping one's nuclear deterrent in good repair, maintaining
strict control, and clearly communicating its purpose is the mark of a
responsible actor. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however,
**[[is]{.mark} doing much, much more while [keeping the rest of the
world]{.mark} in the [dark]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Now, some observers
even suggest China may abandon its longstanding "No First Use" (NFU)
nuclear policy, which would signal China's intent to stand alongside the
United States and Russia as a nuclear power capable of inflicting
destruction beyond ordinary catastrophe. **[During the September 2015

its DF-41 ICBM, which Western analysts suspect may carry multiple
independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs). Furthermore,
**[[China is developing a sea-based]{.mark} nuclear [deterrent with its

next-generation submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). **[China's

China's first successful tests of missile defense technology under what

currently lag those at sea, one wonders whether an air-based nuclear
deterrent can be far behind.

### No Impact: China Arsenal Small/Weak

#### Chinese nuke mod isn't a threat

from Behind,\" Union of Concerned Scientists,

Summary [[China's]{.mark} nuclear [force is]{.mark} much [smaller
and]{.mark} far [less capable than the]{.mark} nuclear force of the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. [China's current]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**nuclear weapons [modernization program will not change that]{.mark}
situation**, even if the United States does nothing]{.underline}. China
has been improving the quality and increasing the quantity of its
nuclear forces since its first test of a nuclear-armed missile in 1966.
The [pace of these improvements has been]{.underline} steady but
[slow]{.underline}, especially when compared with the growth of China's
economy. [After a half-century of effort, China's nuclear arsenal
remains smaller than the US nuclear arsenal was in 1950]{.underline}
(Kristensen and Norris 2013). [[Creating]{.mark} a nuclear [force
requires]{.mark}]{.underline} three essential capabilities: [1. The
[capability to produce]{.mark} the [fissile materials]{.mark} highly
enriched uranium and plutonium. 2. The capability [to use those]{.mark}
materials [to make warheads]{.mark} that are tested for reliable use as
a weapon. 3. The capability [to deliver these warheads]{.mark} to
targets using missiles, airplanes or other vehicles. Chinese
[capabilities in all three]{.mark} essential [areas]{.mark} of nuclear
weapons production [lag]{.mark} well behind]{.underline} the
capabilities of the United States: 1. [China produced far less highly
enriched uranium and plutonium]{.underline} than the United States. 2.
[China conducted far fewer nuclear weapons tests]{.underline} than the
United States [and]{.underline} consequently [produced fewer nuclear
warhead designs]{.underline}. 3. [[China has]{.mark} far [few]{.mark}er
[vehicles]{.mark} to deliver its nuclear warheads]{.underline}. China's
ongoing [[modernization]{.mark} program currently **[does not include
efforts to produce]{.mark} more [fissile materials]{.mark} or test new
nuclear warhead designs**]{.underline}. The only nuclear weapons-related
capability China continues to improve is its delivery vehicles. [China
does not currently deploy nuclear weapons on submarines or on
aircraft]{.underline}. China's nuclear capability is concentrated in
[[ground-based]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear-capable
[[missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[are]{.mark} far [fewer in
number,]{.mark} and demonstrably less capable, than their US
counterparts.]{.underline} China's nuclear [modernization
program]{.underline} may eventually include plans to deploy a small
number of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) and air-launched
cruise missiles, but its primary [focus appears to be making incremental
improvements to the quality and quantity of China's ground-based
ballistic missiles]{.underline}. Unless the United States dramatically
reduced the size of its nuclear arsenal, the limitations of China's
current nuclear weapons modernization program guarantee an overwhelming
US superiority in number and capability of nuclear forces. The most
effective means to allay US and allied concerns about the future size
and capability of China's nuclear force are to: • Prevent China from
producing more of the fissile materials needed to make nuclear warheads.
• Prevent China from testing new nuclear warhead designs. Both can be
done using arms control agreements.

More recently, the commander of an artillery brigade observed (in
Chinese at about five minutes into the video), "We
**[[commanders]{.mark} still [work with traditional]{.mark}
[methods]{.mark} and we have not changed training methods and concepts
for informatized and digitized equipment]{.underline}**." Similarly, [a
battalion commander]{.underline}, whose unit is equipped with the newest
Type 99A tanks, but [was defeated in a 2018 training
exercise]{.underline}, explained "[We only studied the capabilities of
older tanks, but have not completely understood new ones]{.underline}."
The latter two examples are just a small sample of innumerable
criticisms operational unit leaders frequently make about their unit's
and the PLA's overall capabilities. Conclusions [[Despite]{.mark} the
[new]{.mark} weapons, [equipment]{.mark}, and technologies entering the
PLA, and the most massive structural reforms since the 1950s, the
[PLA's]{.mark} general [assessments of its]{.mark} own [capabilities
have become]{.mark}]{.underline}, if anything, [more [acute]{.mark}
during Xi's tenure as Central Military Commission chairman]{.underline},
especially concerning the state of leadership at the operational unit
level. **[The [totality of these]{.mark} [criticisms implies]{.mark} a
[lack of confidence in]{.mark} PLA [capabilities and a failure
of]{.mark} the PLA's educational and [training]{.mark} [systems]{.mark}
to prepare commanders and staff officers for future war]{.underline}**.
[Therefore]{.underline}, [the senior Chinese [military]{.mark}
leadership [demonstrates]{.mark} little or [no enthusiasm to commit the
PLA]{.mark} to actual [combat]{.mark} against [a modern
foe]{.mark}]{.underline}, preferring to achieve China's national
objectives through deterrence and actions short of war conducted by a
combination of civilian, government, paramilitary, and military forces.
Based on its own timeline, [the PLA leadership would prefer to continue
doctrinal and training experimentation and structural adjustments until
2035 when Xi has ordered military modernization to be
completed]{.underline}. However, in the coming decade, should deterrence
fail and the PLA is compelled to fight, its leadership will respond with
the capabilities at hand, combining old weapons with new ones,
high-technology systems with low-technology ones, and integrating
military and civilian assets to defend China's sovereignty, territorial
claims, and national interests. [Whether the PLA is successful in future
combat]{.underline}, however, [depends on several factors that may be
beyond its control, such as when and where the fight takes place, who
the enemy is, and the circumstances that caused the
conflict]{.underline}. Though the PLA's self-assessments of its own
shortcomings are subjective in nature, they should be incorporated into
foreign analyses of China's military capabilities and intentions. For
example, both Roger Cliff's China's Military Power: Assessing Current
and Future Capabilities and RAND's China's Incomplete Military
Transformation from 2015 include considerations of the subjective
elements of doctrine, organization, personnel, and training in their
analysis. The 2018 U.S. Department of Defense report to Congress on the
Chinese military and [[the]{.mark} U.S.-China [Economic and Security
Review Commission]{.mark} report on Chinese military reorganization and
modernization both [mention]{.mark} briefly [the]{.mark} "[Five]{.mark}
[Incapables]{.mark}"]{.underline} (the Defense Department calls it the
"so-called the 'five unable' problem") [[and other challenges]{.mark}
the PLA faces]{.underline}. More in-depth analysis regarding weaknesses
in individual services or specific combat functions could be
illuminating for a number of reasons. If the entire range of
shortcomings in existing PLA capabilities identified by the Chinese
media is incorporated into analysis of Chinese intentions, [[**it is
extremely difficult** to support]{.mark} the U.S. National Defense
Strategy's assertion that China is conducting [a]{.mark} "a
[mil]{.mark}itary [mod]{.mark}ernization [program]{.mark} that seeks
Indo-Pacific regional hegemony in the near-term"]{.underline} \[emphasis
added\]. [The scope and timeframe of that purported objective suggest a
level of confidence not revealed by the Chinese leadership's own public
assessments of PLA capabilities]{.underline}.

#### Modernization efforts are [way too far behind]{.underline}\-\--prevents any gains in strategic parity now.

**Stratfor**, American geopolitical intelligence platform and publisher
founded in 1996 in Austin, Texas, 4/11/**19**

(Stratfor, "China\'s Military Modernization Push Remains a Work in
Progress",
https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/chinas-military-modernization-push-remains-work-progress)//GA

There\'s no question that [China has rushed forth at breakneck speed to
modernize its military]{.underline} over the past few decades. With the
second most powerful navy in the world, China has restructured its
military, overhauled its command and control, introduced new
capabilities and expanded its logistics. The country has advanced so far
that U.S. officials warned in the 2019 Defense Intelligence Agency\'s
\"China Military Power\" report that China has grown more confident in
its new capabilities and could start actively using them. Despite its
impressive rollout of new weapons and the development of new
capabilities, however, **[[China isn\'t ready to close the gap]{.mark}
on the United States]{.underline}** [just yet]{.underline}. [Whether on
nuclear-powered submarines, aerial refueling capabilities or the
logistical ability to land a sufficient number of forces in Taiwan,
**[Beijing]{.mark} still [has plenty of work to do]{.mark} before it can
finally attain some of its most cherished goals**]{.underline}. Plumbing
the Depths for Parity [One prime area where [China lags]{.mark} behind
the United States is [in
**sub**]{.mark}marine**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly nuclear
attack submarines. The Chinese navy has added a sizable number of
diesel-electric submarines to its fleet --- including some of relatively
advanced design --- but [the number of available nuclear-powered attack
submarines remains inadequate to China\'s needs]{.underline}. In
contrast to its approximately 50 diesel attack submarines, [[China only
operates]{.mark} an estimated [six nuclear]{.mark} attack
[submarines]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, China\'s existing
nuclear-powered submarines, including its latest Type 093 boats, still
trail far behind both U.S. and Russian designs in terms of quality, as
they are noisier, possess less advanced sensors and deploy propulsion
technology that is not as capable. [Nuclear attack [submarines]{.mark}
are vital for China for two reasons. First, they [offer China]{.mark}
the most [realistic and effective way to project military power]{.mark}
far from its shores]{.underline}. While Beijing is in the process of
building up a very capable surface fleet, it is not yet powerful enough
to reliably break through the first island chain --- the first stretch
of islands that rings China\'s eastern shore from Japan down through
Okinawa to the Philippines --- let alone dominate distant waters against
U.S. naval opposition. But due to their stealth factor, [submarines
offer China the hope of countering U.S. maritime operations far beyond
the first island chain, even if Beijing cannot yet dream of exerting
control over distant waters]{.underline}. While diesel-electric
submarines are well-suited for warfare within the first island chain,
only nuclear submarines combine the stealth and the range necessary to
engage in modern, long-distance operations. Indeed, Germany (in both
world wars) and the Soviet Union built up powerful submarine fleets
precisely because their surface navies could not contend with the
respective fleets of the Allies or NATO. [Advanced nuclear attack
submarines are also critical for China\'s navy because they provide
another powerful means to counter its main adversary\'s own
submarines]{.underline}. In fact, submarines remain one of the most
effective ways of hunting down other such vessels, particularly in deep
waters. While [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has developed a host of
capabilities to counter an encroaching enemy surface fleet, it [[is
still developing its]{.mark} own [anti]{.mark}-[sub]{.mark}marine
warfare [capabilities]{.mark} and]{.underline}, once again, [only in a
fashion that will be effective in the first island chain]{.underline}.
Various anti-submarine warfare assets, such as the Type 927 catamaran,
the KQ-200 maritime patrol aircraft and the Type 056A corvette, are
unlikely to operate effectively beyond the first island chain because of
their limited range and relatively low ability to defend themselves
against an attack. Nuclear attack submarines would not only assist the
Chinese in pursuing enemy submarines within the first island chain but
also provide the country with the only effective means of hunting down
enemy submarines elsewhere. In terms of the great power competition,
**[[China is]{.mark} well-[aware of its comparative weakness]{.mark} on
nuclear submarines]{.underline}**. Beyond building an improved version
of the Type 093 submarine, [China is also expected to concentrate its
efforts on developing a much-improved Type 095 vessel that will likely
incorporate advanced silencing technology and carry a significant
arsenal of varied torpedoes and missiles]{.underline}. But even if China
manages to construct a Type 095, [it is unlikely to be as
technologically sophisticated as the]{.underline} state-of-the-art U.S.
[Seawolf and Virginia-class submarines]{.underline}, as well as the
Russian Yasen-class submarines. In terms of quantity, too, [[China
cannot hope to roll out]{.mark} as many [nuclear attack
submarines]{.mark} as the United States [for the foreseeable
future]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Trailing at Sea and in the
Air]{.underline}** Another Chinese shortcoming, especially relative to
the United States, centers on its aerial refueling capacity. China
maintains a partial fleet of around a dozen H-6U and IL-78 tankers, but
that is not nearly enough to service an air force the size of China\'s.
Aerial refueling, however, is an important method by which China could
increase the range and loiter time of its combat aircraft. [If Beijing
could accomplish this, its bombers could reach even more distant
targets, while its fighter aircraft could remain in the air longer to
guard key targets]{.underline}. As China develops new combat aircraft
like the H-20 stealth bomber, for instance, aerial refueling capacity
will become all the more important to maximize the capabilities of such
aircraft. And just as it seeks to overcome its deficiencies in terms of
nuclear attack submarines, China is already moving forward with attempts
to improve its aerial refueling capacity. It has developed buddy
refueling (in which one fighter acts as a mini-tanker to refuel a fellow
aircraft) for its J-15 carrier-borne fighters, while it is also
developing a tanker version of its new Y-20 strategic transport
aircraft. These developments, especially once large numbers of the Y-20
tankers come off the assembly line, will do much to bolster China\'s
aerial refueling capacity, but **[[it will be a long time before China
develops enough]{.mark} of these aircraft [to make a strategic
impact]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But [there is another Chinese
shortcoming]{.underline} --- [this one related to Taiwan]{.underline},
whose reunification is a critical Chinese objective and a scenario for
which the Chinese armed forces plan and train extensively. At this
stage, [[China]{.mark} simply [lacks sufficient sealift capacity]{.mark}
to transport enough forces to conduct a credible mass amphibious
invasion of the island]{.underline}. Even with the most optimistic
estimates --- which includes the increased number of Type 071 amphibious
transport docks (six) and landing ships (60) --- [the Chinese could land
no more than four divisions]{.underline} (about 40,000 troops) [in a
mass invasion scenario]{.underline}. Although China could bolster these
numbers by sending subsequent landing waves, [conducting airborne drops
or mobilizing commercial shipping]{.underline}, it [is unlikely to
overcome Taiwanese defenses]{.underline}. Ultimately, even as China
builds up its amphibious capacity by constructing more Type 071 vessels
and new Type 075 amphibious assault ships, **[[it is unlikely to have
the wherewithal to present a credible invasion threat]{.mark} to Taiwan
[for]{.mark} at least [another decade]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
That is not to say that China does not possess other means by which to
coerce or even defeat Taiwan, but the chances of a sudden and immediate
victory through a massive landing operation appear remote. **[Together,
these [gaps]{.mark} in capability]{.underline}** --- [whether they
restrict China\'s ability to compete with the United States, pursue its
primary goal of reunifying with Taiwan or engage in expeditionary
operations]{.underline} --- **[[will]{.mark} continue to [weigh
down]{.mark} Beijing\'s [geopolitical]{.mark}
[ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China has certainly made tremendous
progress over the last two decades, but **[its modernization program
remains a work in progress]{.underline}**.

Affairs, https://chargedaffairs.org/china-doesnt-want-arms-control/)SEM

[Nuclear [arms control has suffered]{.mark} several stinging
defeats]{.underline} over the last two years. President Donald Trump has
withdrawn from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran
and the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia (INF). New
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), the last surviving nuclear arms
control treaty between the US and Russia, is up for renewal, but its
prospects are grim. Additionally, the [Trump]{.underline} administration
recently announced a [push to include China in the New START
treaty]{.underline}. While accomplishing this would be a monumental
achievement, **[[China has little incentive to join and]{.mark} has
openly [refused to take part]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A primary goal of
nuclear arms control is reducing tension by clarifying a state's intent
to use its weapons. Transparency is paramount in allowing signatories to
observe weapon movements, inspect missile bases and silos, and perform
flyovers of the other party's territory. This principle has been at the
core of agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union and
Russia, and as a result greatly reduced the risk of miscalculations that
could lead to nuclear war. [[China]{.mark}'s arms buildup [isn't
competing]{.mark} with U.S. and Russian arsenals]{.underline}. As China
came late to the arms game and have lacked the means to compete, [they
haven't pursued traditional power projecting weapons of mass
destruction. [Their]{.mark} nuclear [stockpile is estimated at around
250]{.mark}-260 [warheads]{.mark}]{.underline}, compared to the U.S.
stockpile of 4,018 and the Russian stockpile of 7,850. [The primary
reason China won't join negotiations for New START is simple --- it
doesn't need to. [New]{.mark} START [limits deployed nuclear
warheads]{.mark}]{.underline} (1,550), nuclear capable launchers (800),
and deployed missiles and bombers (700), [[at levels well above what
China has or could field in the near future.]{.mark} **[Joining the
treaty would be moot]{.mark}** as China does not have enough nuclear
delivery vehicles or warheads to reciprocally pare down.]{.underline}
The United States and Russia have two primary reasons to get China into
arms control negotiations: transparency and intermediate range missiles
(550km to 5000km). While the United States and Russia have traded
superiority in numbers and secrecy for openness and cooperation, [[China
has been able to obscure]{.mark} accurate [counting of its]{.mark}
[nuclear]{.mark} and non-nuclear missile [inventory]{.mark}, what's
deployed, and where it's deployed. Roping China into any agreement would
necessitate **significant transparency measures** from participating
parties]{.underline}. However, given today's geopolitics [any
transparency measures would disproportionately benefit the United
States' and its allies' forces surrounding China]{.underline}. The
United States is situated [in China's backyard]{.underline} with bases
and the U.S. 7th fleet spread throughout the Pacific. Thus, [advanced
[knowledge of]{.mark} Chinese [missile stocks]{.mark} and deployments
[would be key to]{.mark} the [US' defense of the region]{.mark} or
planning an offense]{.underline}. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, on
the other hand, [**[would gain]{.mark} next to [nothing]{.mark}**---it
has few ICBM's capable of hitting the United States and has no assets
within striking distance of the U.S. mainland. China's massive inventory
of intermediate range [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} (US Department of
Defense estimates between 2000 and 2600) counters regional threats, not
global. China's stockpile isn't meant to deter against large swaths of
nukes. It doesn't assure mutual destruction. Instead the missiles [[are
meant to]{.mark} overwhelm adversaries within range of China itself,
[be]{.mark} it [in course of]{.mark} an eventual invasion of Taiwan, the
[intervention]{.mark} of the **United States Navy, Vietnamese or
Filipino assets in the South China Sea**, **Russian land forces**, or
even **the Japanese Navy**.]{.underline} For Russia and the United
States, [[China's]{.mark} intermediate range missile [stockpile
represents]{.mark} a [regional imbalance]{.mark} as neither country has
built or deployed any INF missiles]{.underline} for almost 30 years [per
the INF Treaty]{.underline}. Russia could station these faster, shorter
range missiles along its long border with China, while the United States
could potentially deploy missiles in Guam or Korea. Now that the INF
Treaty is on life support, both nations will rush to close that missile
gap. Yet they would much prefer working to reduce China's stockpile
instead, clipping China's advantage instead of risking a different kind
of arms race. [Yet [INF missiles are China's largest strategic
asset]{.mark}]{.underline}, balancing out the United States' naval,
operational, and nuclear superiority. [[Minimizing]{.mark} that
[advantage]{.mark} in any way, **while Russia and the United States
retain the two largest and most dangerous nuclear stockpiles in the
world**, [is a non-starter]{.mark}. China has already stated that it has
no need for arms agreements and that it believes Russia and the United
States are the only parties responsible for reducing their inventories.
It's hard to envision what could bring China to the table, and the
recent spate of U.S. treaty abrogations doesn't make it an enticing
negotiation partner.]{.underline} If Russia and the United States want
to limit China's asymmetric weapons capabilities, they'll have to get
creative and consider China's greater regional security concerns instead
of just weapons systems.

notwithstanding, the odds are that **it [will remain on the
outside]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To entice Beijing to sign, th[e
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would]{.underline}, for one,
[need to avoid limiting China\'s short and intermediate land-based
missiles and agree to parity for all signatories, but **[Washington
is]{.mark} [unlikely to make]{.mark} such [technical and strategic
concessions]{.mark}.** [China]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[has little
confidence]{.mark} that any such [agreement would last]{.mark},
especially because the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
uncompromising in its efforts to develop ballistic missile defense,
while Russia is unwilling to curb its investment in nuclear delivery
weapons]{.underline} that fall outside the purview of New START unless
the United States offers heavy concessions. [[**Beijing has no wish to
limit itself** through a]{.mark} new [treaty]{.mark}]{.underline} or a
New START extension, only for that agreement to prove temporary amid
wider disagreements over ballistic missile defense and other issues
(after all, even core legacy arms control treaties like the INF Treaty
are proving to be short-lived). In the end, [[China would]{.mark} face a
cost in joining a treaty even in the best of cases, as it would [have to
submit to]{.mark} a certain degree of **[inspections and
monitoring]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This, in turn, would shine a light
into the nooks and crannies of China\'s arsenal --- one of the key
reasons the United States has been pushing to include China in an arms
control pact. [All these [issues are likely to **hinder**]{.mark}
**[progress]{.mark}** toward a trilateral strategic arms control
treaty]{.underline} among the great powers. Simply put, [any [successful
treaty would require painful concessions]{.mark} from all three
countries, but such [concessions]{.mark}]{.underline}, and indeed leaps
of faith, **[[are]{.mark} rather [implausible]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
the short term [[given]{.mark} the considerable **[mistrust]{.mark} and
competition**]{.underline} [that pervades their relations]{.underline}.
So while [China]{.underline} will politely entertain the idea of joining
a New START extension or a successor treaty, it [is ultimately likely to
remain on the sidelines.]{.underline}

**[China's nuclear forces and policies are constrained, first and
foremost, by the country's distinctive approach to nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. As Jeffrey Lewis has written, **[Chinese
leadership has historically believed that nuclear deterrence is largely
unaffected by the size and configuration of the adversary's nuclear
arsenal, so long as the country can threaten a counterstrike of a few
--- or even one --- nuclear warheads.]{.underline}** Marshall Nie
Rongzhen, a leading figure in **[China's early nuclear weapons program,
called this "the minimum means of reprisal.]{.underline}"** Recent
research by Fiona Cunningham and M. Taylor Fravel, based on reviews of
Chinese doctrinal and academic writings and interviews with Chinese
military and civilian experts, indicates that **[these fundamental views
have not changed and that China is likely to continue adhering to its
relatively restrained strategy of "assured retaliation."]{.underline}**
In recent Track-1.5 and Track-2 dialogues between the United States and
China, Chinese participants have said that China could credibly threaten
the United States with only "a few," a "handful of," or even "one"
nuclear warhead. Designed to support more limited goals**[, China's
nuclear forces are generally believed to be smaller and less alerted
than those of other states. The country has yet to develop an early
warning system and some experts believe China would wait several days
after suffering a nuclear strike before launching its own nuclear
counterattack]{.underline}**. Observers believe Beijing does not mate
its nuclear warheads to missiles in peacetime, instead storing them
separately. According to the counting rules of the New START treaty,
China has nearly zero deployed nuclear weapons.

[Stability across the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}, however, [would not
remove]{.underline} all [concerns that a rising China might de-
stabilize the region. Analysts have not fully considered the new
challenges that deep rapprochement would produce in China's relations
with Asia and the United States]{.underline}. Asian countries would be
relieved, but many would worry that [a rising China **no longer
constrained by a focus on Taiwan** would use its increased power to
**challenge** their **interests elsewhere in Asia**]{.underline}. The
United States would have similar concerns about an uncon- strained China
challenging its interests and would face demands for enhanced, credible
defense commitments from regional countries. [Former U.S. Ambassador to
China]{.underline} James [Lilley referred to Taiwan as "the cork in
China's bottle]{.underline}."3 [Deeper rapprochement will remove the
cork, **freeing resources** devoted to military preparations for Taiwan
contingencies and giving the PLA new options. Chi- na's potential
choices for its military modernization include:]{.underline} relaxed
modernization, domestic and conti- nental concerns, [antiaccess focus,
**assertive pursuit of regional maritime claims**, and extra-regional
activities]{.underline}. China's integration into the world economy and
ex- panding interests are already leading to new pressures to take on
some additional missions, but deeper rap- prochement will likely lead to
a more thorough evalu- ation of the proper mix of roles and missions for
the PLA. The direction of PLA modernization and how China uses its
military can help alleviate or further exacerbate international concerns
about a rising Chi- na that will become more powerful, but also less
con- strained by Taiwan.

### CCP Collapse Inev

#### Religion is growing in China---that triggers CCP collapse

**Keck 14**

Zachary Keck is Managing Editor of The Diplomat, The Diplomat, August
12, 2014, "Why Is China Nationalizing Christianity?",
http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/why-is-china-nationalizing-christianity/

**[The growth of religion in China]{.underline}** is to be expected
given the government's relaxation of restrictions on it (compared to the
Mao era) and the profound socio-economic changes China has undergone
since the reform and opening up period began. However, its growth also
**[gives it the potential to act as a unifying force for political
opposition to the CCP's authority]{.underline}**. Crucially,
**[Christianity could]{.underline}** potentially **[cut across regional
divides]{.underline}** in China. The **[rapid growth in religion
is]{.underline}** particularly **[troubling for the CCP]{.underline}**
given that **[its own abandonment of Marxism has created an ideological
vacuum]{.underline}**. In its place, the CCP has increasingly turned to
Chinese nationalism as the ideational complement to economic growth and
prosperity. The "Sinicization of Christianity" would be consistent with
its drive to push Chinese nationalism. On the other hand, the campaign
could be merely an attempt to crack down on the large network of
underground churches in China. As noted above, **[roughly one half of
China's Protestants]{.underline}** are believed to
**[attend]{.underline}** these **[churches]{.underline}**. **[These
operate outside CCP control and are]{.underline}** therefore **[of
particular concern for the Party]{.underline}**. Sinicization could
simply mean trying to force underground Christians into the
state-sanctioned organizations that already put a Chinese bent on
Christianity. In a related campaign, much attention in China has
recently been given to "evil cults," which are essentially fringe
religious groups. The impetus for this was a video that went viral in
May in which a woman was beaten to death outside a McDonald's by a group
of individuals who belonged to "Almighty God," one of the "evil cults."
According to China's state media, members of the Almighty God cult have
been rounded up by the thousands all across China. The Chinese
government also published a list of 14 "evil cults" and pledged a
crackdown on fringe religious groups in the country. The Chinese
government's concern about the cults is not entirely unwarranted.
Besides their potential for low-level terrorist attacks, **[fringe
religious cults have]{.underline}** at times **[mounted serious
challenges to Chinese authorities]{.underline}**. **[The]{.underline}**
the **[initial leader of the Taiping Rebellion]{.underline}**, for
example, **[was a cult leader claiming to be Jesus Christ's
brother]{.underline}**. It's worth noting, though, that in discussing
the evil cults, China's state media has at times conflated them with the
country's broader network of underground churches. For instance, the
Global Times has warned that "**[underground churches]{.underline}** and
evil cults **[are spreading like mushrooms]{.underline}**... **[the
problem is]{.underline}** very **[urgent]{.underline}**."

### No CCP Collapse

#### No CCP collapse---the government represses instability

It might seem reasonable to expect that challenges from the disaffected
urban middle class, frustrated college graduates, and unemployed
migrants will constitute the principal threat to the party\'s rule. If
those groups were in fact to band together in a powerful coalition, then
the world\'s longest-ruling party would indeed be in deep trouble. But
that is not going to happen. Such **[a revolutionary scenario overlooks
two critical forces blocking political change in China]{.underline}**
and similar authoritarian political systems: **[the regime\'s capacity
for repression and the unity among the elite]{.underline}**. **[Economic
crisis and social unrest may make it tougher for the CCP to govern, but
they will not loosen the party\'s hold on power. A glance at countries
such as Zimbabwe, North Korea, Cuba, and Burma shows that]{.underline}**
a relatively **[unified elite in control of the military and police can
cling to power through brutal force, even in the face of abysmal
economic failure]{.underline}**. Disunity within the ruling elite, on
the other hand, weakens the regime\'s repressive capacity and usually
spells the rulers\' doom. **[The CCP has already demonstrated its
remarkable ability to contain and suppress chronic social protest and
small-scale dissident movements. The regime maintains the People\'s
Armed Police]{.underline}**, a well-trained and well-equipped anti-riot
force of 250,000. In addition, **[China\'s secret police are among the
most capable in the world]{.underline}** and are augmented by a vast
network of informers. And although the Internet may have made control of
information more difficult, **[Chinese censors]{.underline}** can still
**[react quickly and thoroughly to end the dissemination of dangerous
news]{.underline}**. Since the Tiananmen crackdown, the Chinese
government has greatly refined its repressive capabilities.
**[Responding to tens of thousands of riots each year has made Chinese
law enforcement the most experienced in the world at crowd control and
dispersion]{.underline}**. Chinese state security services have applied
the tactic of \"political decapitation\" to great effect, quickly
arresting protest leaders and leaving their followers disorganized,
demoralized, and impotent. If worsening economic conditions lead to a
potentially explosive political situation, the party will stick to these
tried-and-true practices to ward off any organized movement against the
regime.

#### CCP is resilient and instability impacts are empirically denied. 

**Li '13**

(Eric X. is a board of directors -- China Europe International Business
School, fellow -- Aspen Institute, "The Life of the Party," Foreign
Affairs, Vol. 92, Issue 1, Jan/Feb)

Even if [critics]{.underline} accept that the Chinese government is
adaptable and meritocratic, they [still question its
legitimacy.]{.underline} Westerners assume that multiparty elections are
the only source of political legitimacy. Because China does not hold
such elections, they argue, the CCP\'S rule rests on inherently shaky
ground. Following this logic, [critics have predicted the party\'s
collapse for decades, but no collapse has come.]{.underline} [The most
recent version of the argument is that the CCP has maintained
its]{.underline} hold on [power only because it has
delivered]{.underline} economic [growth]{.underline} \-- so-called
performance legitimacy. No doubt, performance is a major source of the
party\'s popularity. [In a poll of Chinese attitudes]{.underline}
published by the Pew Research Center in 2011, **[87
percent]{.underline}** of respondents **[noted satisfaction with the
general direction of the country]{.underline}**, 66 percent reported
significant progress in their lives in the past five years, and a
whopping 74 percent said they expected the future to be even better.
[Performance legitimacy, however, is only one source of the party\'s
popular support. Much more significant is the role of Chinese
nationalism and moral legitimacy.]{.underline} When the CCP built the
Monument to the People\'s Heroes at the center of Tiananmen Square in
1949, it included a frieze depicting the struggles of the Chinese to
establish the People\'s Republic. One would expect the CCP, a
Marxist-Leninist party, to have its most symbolic political narrative
begin with communism \-- the writing of The Communist Manifesto, for
example, or perhaps the birth of the CCP in 1921. Instead, the first
carving of the frieze depicts an event from 1839: the public burning of
imported opium by the Qing dynasty\'s imperial minister, Lin Zexu, which
triggered the first Opium War. China\'s subsequent loss to the British
inaugurated the so-called century of humiliation. In the following
hundred years, China suffered countless invasions, wars, and famines \--
all, in the popular telling, to reach 1949. And today, the Monument to
the People\'s Heroes remains a sacred public site and the most
significant symbol of the CCP\'S national moral authority. [The CCP\'S
role in saving and modernizing China is a far more durable source of its
legitimacy than the country\'s economic performance.]{.underline} It
explains why, [even at the worst times of the party\'s rule]{.underline}
in the past 63 years, including the disastrous Great Leap Forward and
Cultural Revolution, [the CCP was able to keep the support of mainstream
Chinese long enough for it to correct its mistakes.]{.underline}
China\'s [recent achievements]{.underline}, from economic growth to
space exploration, [are only strengthening nationalist
sentiments]{.underline} in the country, [especially among the
youth.]{.underline} [The party can count on their support for
decades]{.underline} to come. A final type of **[staying power comes
from repression]{.underline}**, which China watchers in the West claim
is the real force behind the CCP. They point to censorship and the
regime\'s harsh treatment of dissidents, which undoubtedly exist. Still,
[the party knows very well that general repression is not sustainable.
Instead, it seeks]{.underline} to employ [smart
containment.]{.underline} The strategy is to give the vast majority of
people the widest range possible of personal liberties. And [today,
Chinese people are freer than at any other period in recent
memory]{.underline}; most of them can live where they want and work as
they choose, go into business without hindrance, travel within and out
of the country, and openly criticize the government online without
retaliation. Meanwhile, [state power focuses on containing a small
number of individuals who have political agendas and want to topple the
one-party system.]{.underline} As any casual observer would know, over
the last ten years, [the quantity of criticism]{.underline} against the
government online and in print [has increased exponentially \-- without
any reprisals.]{.underline} Every year, there are tens of thousands of
local protests against specific policies. Most of the disputes are
resolved peacefully. But [the government deals forcefully
with]{.underline} the [very few]{.underline} who aim to subvert China\'s
political system, such as Liu Xiaobo, an activist who calls for the end
of single-party rule and who is currently in jail. [That is not to say
that there aren\'t problems.]{.underline} [Corruption]{.underline}, for
one, [could]{.underline} seriously [harm the CCP\'S
reputation.]{.underline} **[But it will not derail party
rule]{.underline}** anytime soon. Far from being a problem inherent to
the Chinese political system, corruption is largely a byproduct of the
country\'s rapid transformation. When the United States was going
through its industrialization 150 years ago, violence, the wealth gap,
and corruption in the country were just as bad as, if not worse than, in
China today. According to Transparency International, China ranks 75th
in global corruption and is gradually getting better. It is less corrupt
than Greece (80th), India (95th), Indonesia and Argentina (tied at
100th), and the Philippines (129th) \-- all of which are electoral
democracies. Understood in such a context, the Chinese government\'s
corruption is by no means insurmountable. And [the party\'s deeply
rooted popular support will allow it the breathing room to grapple with
even the toughest problems.]{.underline}

U.S. corporations saw the potential for growth in China as a huge
opportunity. They charged headlong into the Chinese market, and they
made a lot of money doing it. As a result, the U.S. and Chinese
economies are more tightly linked today than at any point in history --
and China is hoping to use that fact to its advantage. Now that it's
clear China can't help on North Korea, this is China's Plan B: to show
the U.S. that it has just as much to lose from taking a harsh stance on
trade relations as China does. In recent weeks, **[China]{.underline}**
has done this by **[suggesting it could slow]{.underline}** or halt

## Grand Bargain Solvency Answers

### Solvency: China Says No

#### China rejects any bargain -- leaders see Taiwan as too important to negotiate over

In "A U.S.-China Grand Bargain?" Charles [Glaser suggests that the
United States should strike a grand bargain]{.underline} with China by
ending its commitment to Taiwan in exchange for Beijing's promise to
peacefully resolve its maritime disputes and to accept the U.S. security
presence in East Asia.1 Although Glaser's desire to mitigate the chances
for future conflict with an increasingly powerful and ambitious China is
laudable, **[his proposed grand bargain is a nonstarter.]{.underline}**
Glaser acknowledges that [territorial accommodation could come at the
cost of **downgrading China's assessment of U.S. resolve** to protect
its interests and allies in Asia, compromising American values, and
damaging U.S. credibility in the eyes of its allies]{.underline}. He
insists, however, that by demanding China keeps its side of the bargain
and by enhancing U.S. military capabilities in the region, the United
States would signal its determination to stand by American interests.
Glaser's proposal is unsound for several reasons. First, [if the United
States did not damage its image by attempting such a bargain in the
first place, it would not need to redemonstrate resolve]{.underline}.
Second, [such a bargain would undercut one of the fundamental reasons
why the United States stands with its friends and allies in East
Asia---a shared appreciation of democracy and liberty]{.underline}.
Third, [Glaser emphasizes that regardless of whether the United States
and China were able to strike a grand bargain, the very attempt would
provide useful information about China's foreign policy decisionmaking
and long-term aims]{.underline} (pp. 79--82). [Engaging in such a costly
and risky exercise to gauge Chinese motives is imprudent]{.underline} to
say the least, especially because motives evolve and are contingent on
the behavior of other actors. Fourth, [giving any state a concession for
doing something it ought to do sets a **dangerous
precedent**]{.underline}. China and other claimant states should solve
their maritime disputes peacefully and refrain from unilateral moves.
Even if one were to set aside all of the above concerns, [history shows
that Glaser's proposal is infeasible, because **Chinese leaders do not
see the abrogation of the U.S. commitment to Taiwan as an issue over
which they must bargain and offer concessions**]{.underline}. For
example, President Richard [**Nixon** attempted a similar grand
bargain]{.underline} while negotiating the opening of Sino-U.S.
relations from 1971 to 1972. At the time, one of the Nixon
administration's greatest concerns was ending the Vietnam War. Beijing's
greatest priority was obtaining U.S. recognition of Taiwan as a part of
the People's Republic of China (PRC) and securing the withdrawal of U.S.
troops from the island.2 [Understanding]{.underline} \[End Page 185\]
[Beijing's desires]{.underline}, President [Nixon]{.underline} and
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger [strategized that they would offer to
remove U.S. troops in exchange for China's help in achieving peace with
honor in Vietnam]{.underline}. Nixon's handwritten notes for his
historic trip to China demonstrate the bargain he wanted to strike:
Taiwan = Vietnam = trade off 1. Your people expect action on Taiwan 2.
Our people expect action on VN Neither can act immediately---But both
are inevitable---let us not embarrass each other.3 In preparation for
Nixon's official visit, Kissinger made a secret trip to Beijing in July
1971 and proposed the bargain to the Chinese leadership. In a meeting
with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, Kissinger stated that because
two-thirds of the U.S. forces in Taiwan were related to American efforts
in the Indochina theater, the withdrawal of those troops would depend on
the resolution of the Vietnam War.4 He reasoned that although the United
States was sincere in wanting to end the war, several issues--- ranging
from war reparations to the North Vietnamese government's refusal to
talk with the South Vietnamese government---stood in the way of an
"honorable" exit.5 Kissinger implied that China's help in pressuring its
North Vietnamese ally to accept the administration's peace terms would
speed the exit of U.S. troops from Taiwan. [Chinese
leaders]{.underline}, however, [refused to strike such a
bargain]{.underline}. [**In their eyes, Taiwan was a rightful part of
the PRC and they did not owe the United States anything in exchange for
a withdrawal of U.S. forces from territory they considered theirs**.
Zhou]{.underline}, for example, [told Kissinger during
their]{.underline} July 1971 [meeting that attempting to attach
conditions]{.underline} to the recognition of China's sovereignty over
Taiwan [was as absurd as China questioning U.S. sovereignty over Hawaii
or Long Island. He emphasized that the United States should
"unreservedly" recognize the PRC's sovereignty]{.underline} and withdraw
all U.S. troops, as this was "the natural logic of the matter."6 Again
when Nixon suggested during his trip to Beijing in February 1972 that
ending the war in Vietnam would "help the direction on Taiwan,"7 Zhou
replied subtly that China was willing to "wait a little while," and that
because Taiwan was China's "internal affair," Beijing could not "place
too much hope on the U.S. and Mr. President to achieve this."8 Moreover,
China continued to fund North Vietnam's war efforts in the name of
aiding nationalist revolutions \[End Page 186\] abroad. Instead of
pressuring its ally, Beijing sent unprecedented amounts of military
assistance to North Vietnam between 1971 and 1973.9 [China today is
**much more confidant and ambitious** than the China Nixon visited in
1972. **There is little reason to believe that Beijing would entertain a
bargain similar to the one it rejected decades ago.**]{.underline}

APPEASEMENT NOT PREFERRED IN THEORY OR PRACTICE [Glaser]{.underline}
contrasts his defensive realist approach with structural realism and
offensive realism, which he says predict that U.S.-China relations will
resemble those between the United States and the Soviet Union during the
Cold War, with nuclear weapons keeping the peace but with insecurity
increasing as China attempts to claim regional hegemony. He [does not
assess competing structural and offensive realist
explanations]{.underline}, however.2 And [**without convincing
evidence** that Chinese aims are limited and nationalism]{.underline}
\[End Page 178\] [is under control, it is **unclear** why a defensive
realist approach should be assumed rather than tested.
Glaser]{.underline} argues that an established power can enhance its
security by pursuing territorial accommodation toward a rising power. He
[cites international relations theorists]{.underline} who lament that
concessions-granting strategies suffer a stigma in foreign policy
circles.3 [**The literature suggests, however, that appeasement usually
fails**, and even in the handful of historical circumstances in which it
may have succeeded, its **benefits tended not to last**]{.underline}.4
Efforts to model strategies of accommodation suggest that [a declining
power may instead have incentives to hold the line early]{.underline}
against a rising challenger to preempt its use of salami tactics and
avoid engaging in a future conflict under less favorable conditions.5
[Glaser offers **almost no coverage** of the most studied case of failed
territorial accommodation vis-à-vis Germany, nor does he provide
historical examples where accommodation succeeded.]{.underline}
Applications of bargaining theory are generally unsupportive of
appeasement, stressing incentives that governments have to misrepresent
their intentions.6 [An accommodation strategy might make sense for a
weak power]{.underline} with reliable intelligence that its adversary
has limited aims [or for a relatively matched power]{.underline} that
seeks to buy time for rearmament.7 [These conditions do not apply to the
U.S.-China case, however. The United States lacks reliable intelligence
on China's limited aims, but it is not a weak power and it has no need
to abandon Taiwan]{.underline} for the sake of improving its military
capabilities. Glaser suggests that the United States seek accommodation
before Beijing amasses greater power, but [**China's economic growth is
slowing**; corruption and skills gaps plague its military; and the
Communist Party faces crises of social stability, governance and
legitimacy over economic inequality, land use, public safety, and
environmental pollution. The theoretical need to accommodate China is
thus not established.]{.underline} MIS-ASSESSMENT OF COSTS AND BENEFITS
Glaser nonetheless sees benefits in accommodating China on Taiwan. He
opines that current Taiwan policy could precipitate a U.S.-China cold
war, even though [the United States has **much greater economic
interdependence** with China than it did with the Soviet Union and even
though China is more globalized today than the Soviet Union ever
was]{.underline}. He worries that the U.S. commitment to Taiwan will
fuel an arms race, even \[End Page 179\] though China is currently the
only one racing.8 Glaser identifies [U.S. arms sales]{.underline} to
Taiwan as a major stumbling block for improving U.S.-China relations and
winning the "hearts and minds of 1.3 billion people" (p. 71). But the
sales [have been defensive in nature and limited in scale]{.underline}.9
Although the United States' "six assurances" to Taiwan specify that arms
sales not be suspended as a result of negotiations with Beijing, such
sales have been slowed by U.S. bureaucratic considerations and budgetary
debates in Taipei. Glaser does not mention how Barack Obama's
administration came to office focused on strategic reassurance with
China, including delaying arms sales to Taiwan and, controversially,
issuing a joint statement respecting Chinese "core interests."10
[Despite]{.underline} these [efforts at accommodation, Chinese foreign
policy became more assertive rather than more cooperative. **Points of
friction in U.S.-China relations abound**---from cyber espionage and
human rights to trade disputes and financial governance. Abandoning
Taiwan **will not stop** Chinese **military modernization**,
**antiaccess/area denial** development, or the **targeting of U.S.
bases** in Japan and South Korea with Chinese missiles]{.underline}.11
The United States has numerous reasons for conducting [**surveillance
and freedom of navigation** operations]{.underline}, so those activities
Glaser identifies [as irritants to China would not end, even if Taiwan
were no longer a subject of disagreement. Foreign policy ambition in
Beijing has outgrown]{.underline} the 1950s and 1990s [cross-strait
crises; Chinese internal debates tend to paint the United States as a
**global competitor**,]{.underline} benchmark U.S. global capabilities,
[and derive legitimacy from contrasting Chinese political values with
"Western"]{.underline} or "universal" [values]{.underline}.12 [Glaser
does not mention Chinese efforts at building up **alternative
institutions** such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Conference
on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia, Boao Forum for
Asia, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, or China using issues of
historical animosity to drive a wedge between Japan and South Korea. He
thus **underestimates** the apparent Chinese strategy of not directly
confronting the United States globally, while attempting to dilute U.S.
alliances in Asia, pursuing a Chinese-centered regional architecture,
and changing the status quo in maritime areas without going so far as to
trigger conflict or a coherent balancing coalition]{.underline}.13
Rather than alleviate frictions, [a grand bargain would likely motivate
beliefs that China could **eventually dismantle the U.S. security
architecture** in Asia, **emboldening actors on the Chinese side to
pursue their interests more assertively**]{.underline}. U.S. abandonment
of Taiwan would entail repealing the Taiwan Relations Act, ending the
legal basis for defense cooperation and arms sales, immediately
undermining deterrence, and steadily \[End Page 180\] degrading Taiwan's
defense capabilities in ways difficult to reverse.14 Meanwhile, [China's
salami tactics, in combination with its ability to quickly redeploy
military assets]{.underline} it might agree to pull back and its
demonstrated long-term approach to the East China and South China Seas,
[make any such deal as Glaser suggests not credible. **Chinese official
documents give no reason to believe that Beijing would be conciliatory**
on other claims if the United States accommodated China on
Taiwan]{.underline}.15 [Taipei also claims sovereignty over
the]{.underline} Japanese-controlled [Senkaku]{.underline} Islands in
the East China Sea. Beijing's legal claim to these islands, which it
calls the Diaoyu Islands, heavily relies on the history of the Republic
of China and the status of "Taiwan Province."16 Meanwhile, Taiwan
maintains troops and recently upgraded its facilities on Taiping/Itu
Aba, the largest naturally occurring feature of the disputed Spratly
Islands, where China has been engaged in land reclamation and
construction on features it controls. [U.S. abandonment of Taiwan would
likely make Chinese decisionmakers believe they could **strengthen their
claims in the East China and South China** **Seas** by coercing Taipei
to consolidate its positions with those of Beijing.]{.underline}
Beijing's assertive policies contrast to the responsible, measured, and
cooperative approach Taipei has taken to managing disputed claims in the
East China and South China Seas.17 Far from being the dangerous source
of entrapment Glaser describes, **[Taiwan is a valuable strategic and
economic partner]{.underline}**.18 In June 2015, [the United States and
Taiwan signed the Global Cooperation and Training Framework
agreement]{.underline} to jointly offer capacity building in areas such
as public health, women's empowerment, environmental protection, and
maritime safety. Leaders across Taiwan's political spectrum have
internalized lessons from the provocative Chen Shui-bian years and are
not about to risk the lives and treasure of their people for the sake of
forcing Washington's hand vis-à-vis Beijing. Moreover, [the United
States has historically managed to **deter challengers and restrain
partners**, preventing both sides from initiating or escalating
conflicts]{.underline}.19 \[End Page 181\] [The U.S. defense commitment
to Taiwan is]{.underline} not preventing something good from happening,
but rather [preventing some seriously bad things from
happening]{.underline}.20 U.S. [defense exchanges and intelligence
sharing with Taipei]{.underline} may annoy nationalists in Beijing, but
they [**help avoid miscalculation, support escalation control, and
discourage provocation and aggression**. Glaser discounts the negative
effects of abandoning Taiwan on U.S. military capabilities and
intelligence gathering in Asia, freedom of navigation, and maritime and
energy security]{.underline}. Under his proposed bargain, the United
States would be avoiding hypothetical costs and pursuing uncertain
benefits while giving up known military benefits and incurring
unnecessary strategic costs.

### Solvency: No grand bargain

#### stopping defense commitments to Taiwan is insufficient to solve for China

Strategic bargains in the status quo ante Strategic bargains form the
sinews of international order, and while they are most likely to be
struck at critical junctures such as following crises or wars, once
struck they do not simply disappear but continue to evolve and might be
renegotiated. As such, anything we may propose in the contemporary
setting would in fact be a new grand bargain between the United States
and China. It would not be created from scratch, because the [status quo
ante is already marked by a series of 'grand', regional, trilateral and
bilateral bargains.]{.underline} This is a fundamentally important
point---it shows that [Washington and Beijing]{.underline} (and other
East Asian states, for that matter) [have been and are capable of
striking bargains.]{.underline} But this understanding also presents
constraints for any new proposed bargain because it will involve
revising or renegotiating previous, disintegrating or continuing
bargains between the United States and China, and between them and
Taiwan as well as Japan. The most important systemic context for a new
bargain is the post--Cold War economic security grand bargain between
China and the United States. The economic side of this bargain is
crucial but undergoing a difficult transformation. In simple terms, the
bargain is based on intensified interdependence underpinned by the US
dollar as the world's reserve currency. Like other supporter states,
China has gained access to the US market in exchange for its undervalued
currency, which in turn supports massive US state spending. Essentially,
this is a bargain that China and other key lenders and exporters keep
accumulating US dollars while the United States keeps consuming foreign
goods and services.7 As Michael Mastanduno argues, this grand systemic
bargain has been fatally undermined by the global financial crisis,
which will force the United States to eventually draw down domestic
consumption and borrowing, and consequently also reduce its tolerance
for China's exportled growth strategy. In parallel, since the crisis,
China has redoubled its focus on developing its domestic consumer
market, and tried to diversify its foreign reserves holdings away from
overdependence on US dollars. Both these trends are reducing their
mutual interdependence, and, as their 'special economic relationship'
becomes less special, so too will their mutual strategic restraint be
dampened and their security relationship further strained.8 Given this
trend, [**China's incentives** **to strike a new asymmetrical bargain**
with the United States, like the one Glaser suggests, **are
unclear**]{.underline}. On the security side, [any new US--China grand
bargain would have to grapple with another central but disintegrating
previous bargain]{.underline}. During the Cold War, the East Asian order
was underpinned by the alliance between the United States and Japan in
which Washington extended its security umbrella over Tokyo in exchange
for Japan's disarmament, pacification and guaranteed alignment with the
'free world'. In effect, this bargain saw the United States stepping
into the breach between Japan and China as an 'outside arbiter
play\[ing\] a policing role'. By making Japanese defence dependent on
itself, the United States extended a 'dual reassurance', simultaneously
guaranteeing China and Japan their security against each other,
obviating the need for them to engage in direct security competition.9
After 1995, the revitalisation of the US--Japan alliance based on Japan
playing a more active regional and global military role seemed to
undermine Washington's ring-holding ability between Japan and China.
Beijing began to regard the US--Japan alliance less as a means to
constrain than to facilitate Japan's remilitarisation, a view reinforced
by the central role of the alliance in the more recent US 'rebalance' to
Asia.10 There is also a growing view within China that the United States
used the cover of the alliance to 'illicitly transfer' sovereignty over
the Senkaku/ Diaoyu Islands to Japan during the 1970s.11 Using the lens
of these disintegrating existing strategic bargains highlights the major
unresolved sticking point of Japan's increasingly contested role in the
regional order. While Glaser does take Japan into account, [his main
concern is whether ending the US defence commitment to Taiwan will
negatively affect the credibility of the US alliance with
Japan.1]{.underline}2 But [the US--Japan alliance has already changed in
character]{.underline}---and from China's point of view to the detriment
of a previous bargain. Thus, [**any proposed new Sino-American bargain
that takes the US--Japan alliance as a constant** while asking both
China and Japan to make concessions in their territorial disputes is
**unlikely to be acceptable**]{.underline}. Many Chinese no doubt would
prefer to continue to characterise Japan as a second-rate 'American
lackey', but increasingly under President Xi Jinping's 'striving for
achievement' strategy, these two allies are being differentiated, with
the United States viewed as China's only strategic competitor and Japan
as one of its key 'hostile countries'.13 Against this background, the
assumption that Japan's 'normalisation' is an inevitable prerequisite
for regional power-sharing is too casual. Arguably, there is now more
than an unintentional security dilemma between China and Japan,14 and
their growing conflicts of interest and nationalism are likely to create
an insecurity spiral that will undermine the prospects for a US--China
grand bargain that involves any compromise between China and Japan.
[Pre-existing and evolving bargains also surround the issue of Taiwan
that is central to Glaser's proposed strategy of territorial
accommodation.]{.underline} On Taiwan, China and the United States
achieved a limited bargain during the 1979 normalisation based on the
principle of 'one China'. Beijing was accorded diplomatic recognition
and authority over all China, and Washington recognised that Taiwan is
part of China and relinquished the right to encourage Taiwanese
independence (although not its right to sell arms to Taiwan). While they
agreed on the peaceful means of resolving the problem, they disagreed on
the necessity of reunification as the eventual outcome.[15 Since then,
China and the United States have each tried to negotiate alternative
bargains with Taiwan, partly to stabilize the remaining ambiguities of
the status quo ante]{.underline}. The rival models come across clearly
in an illuminating exchange between a Chinese and an American scholar,
Jia Qingguo and Alan Romberg.16 Beijing's offer is in the form of the
'one country, two systems' track of reunification, whereby Taiwan would
trade independence for the preservation of its separate political system
(exactly how is unspecified) and even control of its own armed forces.17
The current US bargain with Taiwan aims at preserving the status quo,
exchanging the US defence commitment and arms sales for Taiwan's 'three
nos' to war, unification or independence. [**Ceasing US defence for
Taiwan** as Glaser suggests will mean not only **withdrawing the US
bargain but also making the Chinese one unnecessary,** thus changing the
potential terms of reunification]{.underline}. Understanding this
context is important because it suggests that [while Taiwan is central
to China's security and national identity, Beijing might not place as
high a value on potential US accommodation on this issue as Glaser
suggests.]{.underline} Within the Chinese discourse, there is grave
doubt anyway about whether the 'Taiwan card' is really that powerful any
more in the relationship with the United States, given that China thinks
that time is on its side.18 Thus, [while accommodation on Taiwan is
essential, it is **unlikely to be sufficient to make Glaser's grand
bargain acceptable** to the Chinese.19]{.underline}

[The probability that China would accept the grand bargain might be
**low**, but neither the history that Kim reviews nor current Chinese
thinking make this a certainty]{.underline}. As I \[End Page 188\] note
in my article, [there are reasons for doubting that China would make the

The Risks of Accommodation ¶ Although the Trump administration has
pushed the relationship toward greater competition, [some experts
believe that the United States and China should manage their differences
by striking a "**grand bargain**]{.underline}." Charles **[Glaser
suggests]{.underline}** that the United States should **[end its
commitment to Taiwan in exchange for China peacefully resolving its
maritime disputes and accepting a long-term U.S. military presence in
the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**.8 Lyle **[Goldstein]{.underline}**
argues that the two countries should work together to encourage the
development of "**[cooperation spirals."]{.underline}** Chinese leaders,
for their part, have touted "win-win" solutions and a new model of
great-power relations.9 ¶ [The attraction of accommodation is
obvious.]{.underline} If successful, it would avoid the costs associated
with prolonged political, economic, military, technological, and
ideological competition, and it would facilitate compromise on issues
such as climate change, where joint U.S.-Chinese action is sorely
needed. The logic of this approach is equally straightforward: If the
United States has failed to shape Chinese behavior through a combination
of engagement and hedging, then it should seek to defuse the emerging
confrontation before the balance of power becomes even less favorable.
[Unfortunately, accommodation is a bad bet for several
reasons]{.underline}. ¶ [First, **the United States cannot simply "make
a deal"** on many core issues since those issues have to do with the
territory and interests of U.S. allies and partners. Washington does not
itself claim the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, Scarborough Shoal, or Taiwan,
so it cannot relinquish those claims]{.underline}. Entering negotiations
with Beijing over the heads of leaders in Tokyo, Manila, and Taipei
would undermine the U.S. network of alliances and partnerships. [U.S.
leaders would thus find it difficult to strike a grand bargain unless
they are also willing to entertain withdrawing from the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} ¶ Second, neither U.S. nor Chinese leaders
can have much confidence that a bargain struck now would hold in the
future. At times of flux in the international hierarchy, established
powers often hesitate to conclude grand bargains because they fear that
the rising power might simply seek to renegotiate the deal later, when
the balance has shifted further in its favor[. So even if the United
States cut a deal that satisfied China in the short term, there is
little guarantee that Beijing would remain satisfied if its influence
continued to grow. I]{.underline}n fact, accommodation could incentivize
greater Chinese revisionism by signaling declining U.S. willingness to
defend its interests or by giving Beijing control of valuable territory
--- such as [Taiwan --- that could serve as a springboard to future
aggression.]{.underline}10 Chinese leaders are also likely to be
skeptical of a grand bargain given that the United States has walked
away from major agreements signed in recent years --- most notably the
Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord. ¶ Finally, perhaps
because of the reasons listed previously, [leaders in Washington and
Beijing appear averse to a grand bargain.]{.underline} Although Trump
vaguely floated the idea in the months after his election, and there
remains the possibility of a broad economic deal to deescalate the
bilateral trade war, his administration recently and publicly dismissed
a broader strategy of accommodation aimed at a comprehensive settling of
differences.11 [Future U.S. administrations are likely to do the same,
given that both Republicans and Democrats have strongly criticized
China's security activities, economic practices, and human rights
violations.]{.underline} Meanwhile, Xi Jinping has provided few
indications that he is willing to make serious compromises in pursuit of
a deal. Quite the opposite: His recent speeches on both foreign and
domestic policy have been strident and confident.12 [Even if a grand
bargain is theoretically possible, it is probably not in the
cards.]{.underline}

#### Text: The United States Federal Government should stress that a unilateral declaration of independence by the Republic of China would not be backed by the U.S. and would not be defended by U.S. forces. The United States Federal Government should publicly state that it is not opposed to peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan, if that results from negotiations between the two and is supported by the Republic of China. The United States Federal Government should encourage the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China to engage in Confidence Building Measures including, but not limited to, track-two discussions on matters involving the Taiwan Strait. The United States Federal Government should establish a forum for track-two discussions to take place. The United States Federal Government should encourage Singapore's Senior Ministers to mediate all discussions. 

#### And, The Counterplan Solves the Case, And Avoids All of the Disads to arms sales reductions -- The U.S. Cannot Be Involved More Than Peripherally If It Wants a Solution Over the Strait -- CP Is the Best Hope of Fostering Dialogue to resolve Taiwan conflict

<http://www.csis.org/images/stories/taiwan/cbm_glosserman.pdf>)

[The menu of possible CBMs is long]{.underline}. It ranges from
unilateral steps, both declarations and actions, to cooperative efforts
that involve two or more parties. One list of possibilities includes: •
Greater Personal Interaction. There should be much greater cross-Strait
personal interaction. These efforts should exist at virtually every
level of society, and should include public and private citizens. Every
effort should be made to develop a greater sense of understanding and of
common community. • Protecting Lives and Interests. The October 1998
Koo-Wang Talks agreement to "strengthen cooperation in protecting the
lives and interests of countrymen from both sides of the Strait"
provides another specific area for progress in cross-Strait relations.
Taiwan has long called for an agreement on protecting the rights and
interests of Taiwan investors on the mainland. Such an agreement would
not only encourage increased investment on the mainland as desired by
the PRC, but would improve prospects for implementing the "three links."
• Sino-U.S. Strategic Dialogue. [Strategic dialogue is also necessary
between the U.S. and China over Taiwan. **These talks are not intended
to develop solutions** -- that is up to Taipei and Beijing -- but to
ensure that both understand the other's security concerns]{.underline}.
Simply stating that Taiwan is an internal Chinese matter does not make
it so. [Even if solving the problem is an internal matter, failure to
solve it is an international concern]{.underline}. Like it or not, U.S.
credibility in Asia is tied to its de facto defense commitment to
Taiwan. A U.S. failure to respond to an unprovoked Chinese attack on
Taiwan could unravel U.S. security alliances in Asia and its regional,
if not international, credibility. • Taiwan-U.S. Strategic Dialogue.
[The history of the last four years shows that there is an equally
important need for ongoing dialogue between Taipei and Washington. Both
sides need a better understanding of the other's thinking, interests,
and objectives]{.underline}. A failure to create and sustain high-level
substantive communications between Washington and Taipei with ensure
that trilateral relations -- between Taiwan, the U.S., and China --
remain confused and unstable. • Track-Two Dialogue. [**The PRC's refusal
to discuss cross-Strait issues in official forums makes nongovernmental,
track-two discussions even more important.** China and Taiwan need a
track-two security mechanism that gives them an opportunity to discuss
security and political issues and explore creative
solutions.]{.underline} A willingness by Beijing to permit cross-Strait
discussions within CSCAP would also help to bring considerable expertise
to bear on the development of innovative cross-Strait CBMs. • Unilateral
Declarations. Unilateral steps could also be taken independently by both
sides to enhance trust and confidence. Many have already been discussed
throughout this analysis. For example, President Chen's unilateral list
of "no's" in his first inauguration should be commended as CBMs in its
own right, as was his willingness to revalidate them in 2004. They are
only effective, however, if they are steadfastly followed. Failing to
honor unilateral pledges, once made, is a confidence destroying
mechanism. A declaration by the PRC to forswear the use of force against
Taiwan would be another example of a unilateral declaration, albeit one
we are not likely to hear. However, Beijing could frequently and
convincingly stress its determination to pursue a peaceful solution and
avoid use of force. [The U.S. can do its part by stressing that a
unilateral declaration of independence by Taiwan would not be backed by
the U.S. and would not likely be defended by U.S. forces. Washington
could also publicly state that it is not opposed to peaceful
reunification of China and Taiwan, if that results from negotiations
between the two and is supported by the people on Taiwan]{.underline}.
**[However, the U.S. should not act as a mediator or take
sides]{.underline}**. [U.S. policy should seek to create an environment
in which China and Taiwan can constructively interact, increase mutual
trust, and begin to resolve their differences]{.underline}. • Outside
Mediation. While U.S. mediation is not advised, the concept of outside
mediation should not be rejected. China has long objected to this form
of preventive diplomacy, arguing that it has no place in "internal
affairs" such as cross-Strait developments. Precedent argues otherwise.
Indonesia provided its good offices to help mediate an internal dispute
between the Philippine central government and Muslim rebels in Mindinao
Province and the U.S. helped mediate between Northern Ireland's warring
Catholic and Protestant factions. [The key to successful preventive
diplomacy is the voluntary participation of all concerned parties.
While, as a general rule, preventive diplomacy is normally practiced
between states, it can apply to intra-state problems, if all parties
involved in the disagreement agree to outside mediation. **Voluntary
participation obviates concerns about interference in one's internal
affairs**; it isn't interference if you are invited to help mediate a
problem.]{.underline} [Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew played
such a role in helping to bring about the first round of formal
cross-Strait discussions in 1993. He remains a logical choice as a
future mediator]{.underline}.

In November 1997, the China Rescue Association (Taipei) and the China
Marine Rescue Center (Beijing) agreed to set up a hotline to facilitate
maritime rescue work in the Taiwan Strait.26 For years Taipei had
indicated its willingness to conduct negotiations through SEF and ARATS
regarding establishing air and sea links between Taiwan and Hong Kong
after July 1, 1997. Beijing rejected Taipei's proposal but backed Hong
Kong's Cathay Pacific Airlines and Shipowners' Association in reaching
agreements respectively with the Taipei Aviation Association and SEF in
July 1995 and May 1997.27 Coming [during the period when Cross-Strait
dialogue was suspended, all those breakthroughs indicate that
nonmilitary CBMs across the Taiwan Strait can be reached, but
not]{.underline} necessarily [through official or semiofficial channels.
Taipei raised these unilateral measures first and often invited Beijing
to adopt reciprocal measures. The agreements thus constituted a process
of unofficial bargaining with official blessings. This graduated
reciprocal approach toward reducing tensions may set a good example for
building CBMs between Taipei and Beijing]{.underline}.28

**[Delicate diplomacy]{.underline}** In the abstract, [a transition of
the W-B-T relationship from an exclusive security triangle to an
inclusive opportunity triangle may seem eminently reasonable, but the
actual **diplomacy of transition is more difficult**]{.underline}. [All
sides are habituated to caution and to suspicion of bilateral collusion

additional problem that **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[is viewed by Beijing as an interfering
outsider and by Taipei as its sole security support.]{.underline}**
Since 2008 the United States has supported Ma Ying-jeou in two
apparently contradictory respects. First, it has demonstrated its
approval of improving cross-Strait relations. Positive steps such as the
inclusion of Taiwan in the Visa Waiver Program were linked to the sense
of relief that the crises of the Chen Shui-bian days were over. Second,
the United States continued arms sales, and at a higher dollar level
than earlier. If the arms sales ceased, then Ma\'s opposition could
claim that Ma had traded friendship with the United States for
friendship with China. Beijing\'s objections to the continuing arms
sales have been rather muted because Beijing also prefers Ma and the KMT
to the alternatives. [American formal diplomacy is]{.underline} thus
**[hamstrung by the embedded security expectations of the
triangle.]{.underline}** **[Track two]{.underline}** and responsiveness
[Given the difficulties of formal diplomacy]{.underline} [and the
sensitivities that all sides have concerning **bilateral
collusion,**]{.underline} [building an inclusive triangle requires more
**subtle and informal confidence-building**]{.underline}.
Non-governmental and [track two efforts should be encouraged, especially
those that involve participation from all three sides]{.underline}.
Government research on relations with China and with Taiwan should
refocus on the dynamic of inclusive opportunities (and their attendant
problems) rather than simply on bilateral relations or on assumptions of
the security triangle. Perhaps a trilateral Eminent Persons Group could
be formed and asked to make recommendations, though not as a first step.
Just as importantly[, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should be actively responsive to improvements and pending improvements
in the cross-Strait relationship. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should be careful to respond in a way and to a
degree that both sides find helpful.]{.underline} **[Neither side wants
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[to act as mediator]{.underline}**. **[Mediation would be unacceptable
to China]{.underline}** [because the cross-Strait relationship is
domestic, and Taiwan would worry that, as a result of asymmetry, the
outcome would be that the United States would side with
China]{.underline}. [But given the present and future importance of the
United States to each side there should be a mutual and continuing
interest in the American attitude and an appreciation of useful
support]{.underline}. [Areas of responsiveness obviously should include
cross-Strait peace accords and the question of continuing American arms
sales]{.underline}, [but efforts should be made to emphasize
responsiveness in economic and societal areas as well.]{.underline}
Ultimately it is up to the United States whether or not it is sidelined
by cross-Strait rapprochement.

#### Track Two Dialogue solves and avoids 'say no'

**Swaine 11**

(Michael, expert in China and East Asian security studies and a Senior
Associate in the Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, "America\'s Challenge: Engaging a Rising China in
the Twenty-First Century," Washington: Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace pg 360-62)

**[The feasibility and parameters of such an agreement could be
initially explored via an authorized Track II dialogue, given its many
obvious sensitivities]{.underline}**. Indeed, any [such approach would
confront]{.underline} three major [problems for the United States.
First]{.underline} and foremost, [some politicians and pundits in both
the United States and Taiwan]{.underline} (**[and]{.underline}** perhaps
also in **[Japan]{.underline}**) [would attempt to label any effort by
Washington to negotiate with Beijing, even in consultation with Taipei,
as a \"sell-out\" of Taiwan\'s interests that could result in China
eventually coercing or seizing the island and]{.underline}. more
broadly, [in irreparable damage to America\'s credibility and strategic
position in Asia and perhaps beyond. Second, both the United States and
China might face considerable difficulties in defining what constitutes
a reasonable exchange of forces, deployments, and arms sales to Taiwan.
A third consideration]{.underline}, often voiced by some observers of
the Taiwan situation, [is that any such U.S. attempt to intervene in the
cross-Strait imbroglio could easily expose Washington to manipulation by
both Taipei and Beijing while possibly increasing the chances of a
miscalculation]{.underline} by all three parties. [The first objection
is the most serious]{.underline} because it is directly related to the
domestic political environments in the United States and
Taiwan---arguably the most serious obstacles to a resolution of the
Taiwan problem. **[There is no doubt that those in both places who want
Washington to treat Beijing as a mortal enemy and Taiwan as an
independent, sovereign nation entirely separate from China would
highlight (and in some instances distort or exaggerate) the dangers
confronting such an approach]{.underline}**. In fact, while pursuing
such an option. Washington would obviously also need to enhance its
larger security posture in Asia, partly in support of its basic
commitment to an uncoerced and peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue.
Also, in this regard, one should not assume that Taipei would inevitably
regard Washington\'s efforts to negotiate with Beijing as a form of
coercion toward the island. [Taiwan\'s objections to opening a
cross-Strait dialogue could be reduced considerably if this dialogue
were presented as seeking with a more active U.S. role, higher levels of
cross-Strait economic interdependence: negotiated Chinese commitments to
more political, economic, and personal freedoms than those currently
contained within the \"one country, two systems\" formula: and
significant, tangible reductions in Beijing\'s capacity to launch a
rapid attack on the island.]{.underline} Also, it is by no means clear
that other Asian nations would regard Washington\'s efforts to negotiate
with Beijing about the Taiwan problem as an unambiguous indication of
America\'s weakness or as a loss of its credibility, as some would
argue. Most Asian nations would doubtless prefer for the issue to be
addressed through some form of direct talks designed to place it on a
more stable long-term footing It is also possible that many Americans
would support US efforts to negotiate with China to stabilize, if not
resolve, the Taiwan issue. This is suggested by the fact that most US
citizens view Taiwan as the least critical threat to U.S. vital
interests out of a litany of threats. Moreover, a vast majority of
Americans are opposed to using U.S. troops to prevent China from
invading Taiwan.\"

### Solvency: SCS

#### And, CMBs establish trust necessary to solve border disagreements

Cooperation and confidence **[The importance of cooperation to manage
the maritime domain and its resources can't be
overstated]{.underline}**. T[his is particularly the case where the EEZ
or territorial sea of one country abuts onto those of
another]{.underline}. **[If boundaries can't be agreed, then
arrangements for the joint management of common interests are
required]{.underline}**. Those arrangements would be in accordance with
UNCLOS Article 74(3), which provides that, pending agreement on
boundaries between adjacent EEZs: the States concerned, in a spirit of
understanding and cooperation, shall make every effort to enter into
provisional arrangements of a practical nature and, during this
transitional period, not to jeopardize or hamper the reaching of the
final agreement. Unfortunately, however**[, a lack of trust may exist
between neighbouring countries with unresolved sovereignty
disputes]{.underline}**. This will prevent cooperation if it's argued
that cooperation isn't possible without confidence and trust between the
parties to the dispute. **[It's the contention of this paper that the
opposite relationship applies---maritime cooperation is an MCBM that
helps build the necessary trust and confidence]{.underline}**.
Cooperation should proceed even as the disagreements are negotiated at
the political level and the sovereignty disputes remain unresolved.
[It's easy to identify and talk about MCBMs; it's much harder to
translate them into a plan for action]{.underline}. The objective with
MCBMs is a security environment in which countries don't feel the need
to build up their maritime forces, thereby creating a security dilemma
for their neighbours or potential adversaries. Thus, when the navies
become involved in the confidence building process, they're effectively
'working themselves out of a job'!

[As with the Taiwan situation, any dependable balance of power must
stabilize, to the greatest extent possible, these maritime territorial
disputes by removing or reducing them as a source of Sino-U.S.
contention]{.underline}. **[Ideally, this should take the form of a
peaceful, permanent resolution of the disputes, through negotiation and
compromise on all sides]{.underline}**. However, [the complexity of the
disputes]{.underline}, involving economic resources; difering
interpretations of applicable international law and historical rights;
overlapping jurisdictional claims based on continental shelves,
exclusive economic zones, and other relevant legal zones; and domestic
political factors rooted in strong nationalist sentiments, together
[suggest that any resolution, if at all possible, will take many years,
and perhaps decades, to achieve. In the meantime, a stable, enduring
modus vivendi among all relevant parties is needed, centered on mutual
restraint in asserting local sovereign or special rights as well as an
efective, peaceful process for handling incidents]{.underline}. **[Such
an understanding ideally should consist of several
elements]{.underline}**. Te frst is [an initial shift away from military
and paramilitary competition and maneuvering toward an emphasis on
diplomacy, primarily via a set of interim]{.underline} (short- to
medium-term) [understandings among the claimants and between Beijing and
Washington regarding levels and types of militarization and the nonuse
of force.]{.underline} Tis must be based on clear, agreed-upon
defnitions of acceptable and unacceptable military behavior and clear,
specifc proscriptions on the display and use of force. Without such an
understanding, any transition toward diplomatic eforts on claims,
jurisdiction, resource development, and an eventual long-term code of
conduct for both the East China and South China Seas will remain
virtually impossible, as all sides continue to maneuver militarily to
deter one another. Moreover, as a part of this negotiation process, some
level of mutually acceptable longterm equilibrium in the military
capabilities of the claimants within the Spratly archipelago must be
achieved, as a stable ceiling against future militarization. Tis might
involve permission for claimants other than China (such as Vietnam) to
upgrade or expand their facilities on land features in the Spratly
Islands to bring them up to a par with those that Beijing has
constructed. As noted above, China's recent construction of artifcial
islands and facilities has at least potentially shifted the military
balance in the archipelago, incrementally increasing China's ability to
threaten the local use of force during negotiations for a future
settlement of the dispute. Te restoration of a stable military
equilibrium among all local parties is therefore a key prerequisite to
the creation of a stable long-term balance in the South China Sea and is
therefore part of a minimalist version of such a balance.19 While all
claimants must eventually ascribe to such dual interim agreements, [the
United States and China will need to take the lead in this efort, based
on a common recognition of the need to remove these issues as a driver
of their deepening strategic contention.]{.underline} Tat said, a
Chinese acceptance of such limits will doubtless prove conditional,
based on the eventual acceptance by the other claimants. Such agreements
will require overcoming domestic military and paramilitary resistance to
any restraints on military activities in disputed areas, including
limits on the frequency of FON operations by the U.S. Navy. They will
also require overcoming the argument that any agreement to eschew an
unprovoked use of force would undermine the sovereignty claims of China
and the other claimants. In truth, [an agreement on limiting
militarization and the use of force can and should be treated as a CBM
and a pathway to a more durable stabilization of these disputes and in
no way as a constraint on sovereignty, especially if all parties
agree]{.underline}.

Obviously, as with the Korea and Taiwan issues, [many obstacles would
confront any eforts to greatly reduce disputes over maritime territorial
claims as a source of Sino-U.S. tension or confict]{.underline}. In
fact, some of these obstacles are very similar to those mentioned in
those two cases, **[including distrust among virtually all the parties
concerned]{.underline}**, nationalist domestic pressures, and deeply
entrenched bureaucratic interests. Others are more specifc, deriving
from the complexity of the issue and the large number of parties
involved. These obstacles will most likely make it particularly
difficult to successfully implement the kind of multiparty,
comprehensive code of conduct outlined above. **[As with the mutual
denial force posture and the Korea and Taiwan issues, more extensive
CBMs and CMMs are likely to be necessary preconditions, to reduce
distrust and strengthen confidence in the enforceability of a legally

[There is no clear and precise formula or set of policies for achieving
a sufciently stable balance of power. In general, a high level of
transparency and predictability and a clear and reliable set of both
deterrence and reassurance capabilities and policies are required to
reduce the need or desire to resort to force or dangerous gambits in
defending interests]{.underline}. [In the Western Pacifc, achieving such
goals would, at a minimum, almost certainly necessitate, on one hand, a
more predictable, less escalatory, and more symmetrical set of defensive
or denial-oriented regional-force postures and related military
doctrines in Beijing, Washington, and among other major Asian
powers]{.underline}, and, on the other hand, **[a more extensive and
intensive array of confdence-building measures (CBMs) and crisis
management mechanisms (CMMs)]{.underline}** **[designed to increase
trust and predictability and reduce the likelihood of security-related
miscalculations in the region]{.underline}**. Te latter should
**[especially address]{.underline}**, directly or indirectly, those
**[regional hotspots that could generate severe confrontations or
military confict between Washington and Beijing,]{.underline}**
**[including the]{.underline}** turbulent Korean Peninsula and
**[China-Taiwan relationship]{.underline}**, maritime sovereignty
disputes between China and several important Asian powers (including
U.S. allies), **[and a range of sensitive U.S. and Chinese regional
military operations and exercises]{.underline}**. Tis set of features
comprises the minimalist version of a stable balance. A maximalist
version of a stable balance would include a set of more ambitious and
farreaching policy changes on both sides designed to greatly reduce (to
a larger degree than just CBMs and CMMs), if not eliminate, the
volatility of these hotspots. Specifcally, this would involve far more
signifcant alterations in the future military and political status of
important territories such as Taiwan and Korea as well as various types
of military deployments and activities in potentially volatile areas
such as the East China and South China Seas. Tese changes would require
revisions in long-standing policies among all parties concerned as well
as reductions in the level of policy infuence resulting from both
domestic ultranationalist viewpoints in China and ideologically based
anticommunism in the United States. It would also likely involve a much
greater level of economic integration of the region, on the basis of a
common, inclusive structure of open and free trade and investment, in
the form of an Asia-Pacifc free trade area.

### Possible Arms Control Mech 

#### CP solves -- it leverages bilateral interests and ensures arms control is effective

**Sagolj 18** (Damir Sagolj, 6-21-2018, \"Chinese Perceptions on Nuclear
Weapons, Arms Control, and Nonproliferation,\" Council on Foreign
Relations,
https://www.cfr.org/report/chinese-perceptions-nuclear-weapons-arms-control-and-nonproliferation)SEM

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS Based on these observations of China's nuclear
doctrine and arsenal, and its views on arms control and
nonproliferation, [I would like to suggest the following policy
recommendations]{.underline}: E**[ngage in bilateral confidence building
and avoid spurring an action-reaction dynamic]{.underline}**. As
discussed above, [China's nuclear force modernization will largely be
influenced by the United States' own efforts to modernize its nuclear
forces. As such, the United States should seek to engage in highlevel
dialogues with China to clarify respective nuclear policies, doctrine
and capabilities, and to engage in confidence building measures to
reduce the prospects of an action-reaction arms race]{.underline} that
will not only be destabilizing for the world, but also prove highly
costly for U.S. taxpayers. On a related note, the [United States should
think holistically about developing ballistic missile defense and
pursuing new nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities]{.underline} that can
increase the strategic vulnerability of other states. **[Strengthen
alliances and the credibility of the United States' security
commitments]{.underline}**. China will continue to modernize its nuclear
forces into the foreseeable future in order to maintain its minimum
deterrent capabilities in the nuclear realm, and as part of its larger
campaign to strengthen its military capabilities. In the midst of
China's military expansion, [it is vital the United States reassures its
allies, especially in East Asia, of the credibility of its security
commitments by clarifying and reinforcing its security assurances,
conducting joint exercises to strengthen alliance capabilities and
interoperability, and resolving disputes with allies in a discreet and
cooperative manner. Neglecting our allies could drive these states to
develop their own nuclear weapons]{.underline} on the one hand,
[triggering a dangerous arms race in the East Asian region]{.underline},
or force them to accommodate China's demands on the other hand, at the
expense of alliance solidarity. The United States' alliances are an
invaluable asset that enable Washington to lead collective challenges
against Chinese aggression and to generally shape outcomes in the global
arena, and their maintenance must be prioritized. **[Leverage China's
desire for stability and its growing international profile and interests
to encourage its active participation in nonproliferation
efforts]{.underline}**. Chinese President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [has
set out ambitious goals]{.underline} to develop China into a world class
power by 2049. [None of these goals can be achieved if China is beset
with chaos and instability due to a war, for instance, stemming from a
nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}. Furthermore, as
more and more [Chinese]{.underline} assets and [citizens]{.underline}
move abroad, they [will also become increasingly vulnerable to nuclear
terrorism]{.underline} and other proliferation-related instability.
[U.S. leaders should leverage China's desire for stability and its need
to protect its growing interests to encourage Beijing to do more to curb
nuclear proliferation]{.underline}. [**Set a leading tone on arms
control**. The United States' most recent Nuclear Posture Review
announced that it would introduce two new types of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in light of the growing threat from China and
Russia, among other actors. As a responsible great power, [the United
States should instead lead the charge against introducing new nuclear
weapons, work to raise the threshold for nuclear conflict, and continue
to rally its counterparts to work toward reducing and ultimately ridding
the world of nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

### Alternate CBMS option

[The attainment of the sort of common understanding on military issues
outlined above would obviously face many obstacles]{.underline}. Te most
signifcant among them would almost certainly be political, largely in
the form of resistance by both U.S. and Taiwanese politicians to any
American efort to limit defense assistance to Taiwan as part of a larger
understanding with Beijing and criticism among Chinese nationalists that
any agreement to limit China's military options in pressuring Taiwan to
enter into political talks with Beijing or in deterring moves toward
independence would undermine China's sovereignty claim over the island.
In addition, some Taiwanese politicians would undoubtedly argue that any
U.S. discussion with Beijing involving the island's security situation
would constitute a betrayal of Taiwan and Taiwanese democracy. And
military professionals on all sides would probably argue that any
signifcant limitation on the ability to employ force in an unexpected
future crisis afecting the island would increase, rather than reduce,
instability by weakening deterrence. Tese and other objections are
discussed in detail in chapter 4. Taken together, they clearly suggest
that **[achieving a reliable understanding between Beijing and
Washington over this long-standing issue of contention in the
relationship will not be easy. But it is also by no means
impossible]{.underline}**, **[given strong and committed leadership in
both capitals]{.underline}** and reliance on an extensive process of
consultations with Taipei, Tokyo, and other relevant parties. Most
important, however, the success of such eforts will depend crucially on
the larger process and objectives involved in the creation of a stable
overall balance in the Western Pacifc. Without this larger context and
the prior enactment of signifcant confdence- and trust-building
measures, any efort to allay the objections to the sort of
security-related understandings presented above would almost certainly
fail. **[A minimalist version of a stable balance of power arrangement
regarding Taiwan would thus involve CBMs centered on a tacit exchange of
a no-independence pledge by Washington for a pledge by Beijing not to
use force]{.underline}**, [in the context of a larger movement toward a
mutual denial force posture and the enactment of more extensive CBMs and
CMMs]{.underline}. Indeed, **[such pledges regarding Taiwan would
probably constitute a necessary precondition for movement toward such a
force posture]{.underline}**.

intensified following Chinese construction and land reclamation projects
over the past year]{.underline}. Voices of moderation are now rare on
both sides of the Pacific. Goldstein reminds readers, however, that
[Beijing made many compromises in the past to settle its land border
disputes]{.underline}. The present situation is undoubtedly dangerous
because of misperceptions and disturbing action/reaction patterns, but
it need not inevitably become "the 'Fulda Gap' of a new Cold War" (p.
291). Creating the conditions for a cooperation spiral will be
difficult, and Goldstein proposes modest initial steps. [To begin, the

antipiracy patrol in the Malacca Strait area in cooperation with the US
Navy. As the two countries build up greater trust, [China must clarify
the precise nature of its claims in the South China Sea and make those
claims consistent with the Law of the Sea.]{.underline} From there, the
United States can begin supporting bilateral negotiations between China

accessed 7/2/19 \|\| OES-AT

Rollback [The most ambitious strategy would aim to roll back China's
gains---essentially, to force Beijing to withdraw from key features in
the South China Sea]{.underline} (certainly the artificial features in
the Spratly Islands, and perhaps its holdings in the Paracel Islands as
well), or at the very least to demilitarize those features by removing
the military facilities and capabilities. As noted, Rex Tillerson
initially appeared to support such a policy when he called not simply
for halting Chinese island building but also for denying Beijing access
to artificial islands constructed to date. 23 [In addition to barring
access to the islands, a rollback strategy might seek to **force Beijing
to walk back its maritime claims in the South China
Sea**]{.underline}---in particular, to abandon the nine-dash line and
accept the 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling, which held that China must
derive its maritime entitlements from legitimate claims to land
features. [The core premise of a rollback strategy is that China's
increasing dominance in the South China Sea poses an unacceptable risk
to U.S. interests, and that the South China Sea will become a "Chinese
lake"]{.underline} unless Beijing's advance is not simply halted but
reversed. By this logic, permitting China to consolidate even its
existing gains will allow it to threaten or disrupt trade flows, rob
other Southeast Asian countries of badly needed economic resources, and
strengthen its regional military position in ways that threaten U.S.
freedom of action. Most importantly, regional states---always sensitive
to who is winning the Sino-American competition for influence---will
bandwagon with Beijing if they conclude that Washington lacks the
capability or will to restore the status quo ante. [The United States
therefore should confront China in the South China Sea today, when it
still enjoys a preponderance of military and geopolitical power in the
region, rather than tomorrow, when the balance may have shifted
decisively in China's favor, owing to Beijing's rapid economic growth
and corresponding military buildup.]{.underline} Rollback is thus an
extremely forward-leaning strategy, one that would rely heavily on the
threat or use of force, as well as other coercive measures, to compel
Beijing to pull back. At the most extreme, the United States might
attack physically features in the Spratlys or Paracels, or threaten to
do so, to eliminate their military facilities and force a Chinese
withdrawal. [A less aggressive alternative would be to blockade or
quarantine the islands (on the legal theory that China enjoys no rights
of access to islands it has created illegally), but U.S. forces still
would have to be willing to risk war by intercepting Chinese ships or
aircraft seeking to break the blockade]{.underline}. 24 As either a
substitute for or complement to these approaches, the United States
might use economic or diplomatic measures--- broadly applied trade
sanctions, threats to recognize Taiwan's independence and conclude a
formal mutual-defense treaty with Taipei, or other relatively dramatic
nonkinetic moves---[to generate the coercive pain necessary to persuade
China to relinquish its South China Sea claims. 25]{.underline}

support would be a clear break from dual deterrence]{.underline}.
Instead of directing warnings and reassurances toward both Taiwan and
China, [the United States would only warn China and only reassure
Taiwan]{.underline}.28 The **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[would welcome a stronger
Taiwan]{.underline}**, but U.S. support would not be preconditioned on
Taiwan's willingness to develop its defenses. The [ultimate goal of this
policy option would be the **establishment of a decisive and durable
U.S. military advantage over the PLA**]{.underline}. The [clearest
indicator of the U.S. commitment is military resources]{.underline}.
Increasing the survivability of American air power in the area around
Taiwan would send a clear signal of support. The American forces
currently deployed in Japan would be the first to respond in a Taiwan
conflict. Increasing the number of hardened aircraft shelters at U.S.
bases in Japan, especially at Kadena Air Base on Okinawa, would protect
aircraft from ballistic missile attacks.29 Additionally, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would revive the annual
arms-sale talks with Taiwan that occurred from 1983 until
2001]{.underline}. Advocates for returning to annual talks argue that
moving away from scheduled talks resulted in arms sales becoming less
frequent.30 [Future arms sales would **include more advanced equipment**
that Washington is currently unwilling to sell to Taiwan, such as the
F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft and]{.underline} diesel attack
[submarines]{.underline}.31 Politically, [American policymakers would
clarify that U.S. military intervention in a Taiwan conflict is
guaranteed]{.underline}. They would interpret the TRA as a serious
commitment to Taiwan's security, and, according to Walter Lohman of the
Heritage Foundation, "\[[make]{.underline}\] [abundantly clear to
Beijing the consequences that will ensue from the use of
force]{.underline}."32 The TRA would not be modified in any way that
reduces the scope of America's commitment. **[Supporters in Congress
would regularly issue resolutions that reaffirm support for the
TRA]{.underline}**, especially the parts related to the defense of
Taiwan.33 Strict interpretation of the TRA would be a clear
demonstration of American willpower to take a hard line against China.
Public statements by American officials about U.S. intervention would
not carry any preconditions or caveats. [Such statements would be
similar to the one made by President George W. Bush in April 2001 that
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would do]{.underline}
"[whatever it takes]{.underline}" [to defend Taiwan]{.underline}.34 Bush
eventually walked back this statement, but [successful implementation of
the restore-superiority option would require similarly categorical shows
of support]{.underline}. [Removing preconditions from the commitment
would **bolster credibility**]{.underline} by removing an off ramp the
United States could take to avoid intervention. Additionally, [Taiwan
would not be expected to spend a certain percentage of its GDP on
defense to secure U.S. arms sales or intervention]{.underline}.

### F-35 Key

#### F-35 is key\-\--offsets Chinese Su-35s and ensures cross-Strait stability.

**Wang**, advisory commissioner for the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Council, and publishes frequently on the Taiwan issue in Sino-American
relations, as well as other topics on East Asian international politics
and regional security, 1/10/**14**

(Kent, "Why The US Should Sell Advanced Fighters to Taiwan",
https://thediplomat.com/2014/01/why-the-us-should-sell-advanced-fighters-to-taiwan/)//GA

According to recent reports, [Moscow and Beijing expect to seal a deal
on the sale of the]{.underline} 4++ generation fighter [Su-35S to China
in 2014. This gives China the **ability to project military power over a
larger portion of Southeast Asia** and indeed, most of
ASEAN]{.underline}. If successful, the acquisition could have an
immediate impact on territorial disputes in the East China Sea and the
South China Sea. The [Su-35]{.underline}, combined with China's already
significant ballistic missile forces and other anti-access weapons,
[could provide strength-in-depth, multi-layered capabilities to protect
China's claims and make others less eager to intervene if China chose to
pursue conflict with its neighbors]{.underline}. So where does Taiwan
fit into this? [China plans to procure the]{.underline} Sukhoi **[Su-35
would place all of Taiwan within the scope of China's air defense
network]{.underline}**. The tactical situation is unfavorable for
Taiwan, as the [Su-35S will be able to spot Taiwan's 126 outdated
indigenous defense fighters and 145 aging F-16A/B fighter at 400
kilometers with its new radar]{.underline}. The deal prompted a new
round of commentary in Washington on the intent behind China's robust
military modernization and Beijing's ultimate ambitions. [Taiwan
currently flies the F-16A/B and is facing a significant decline in its
air defense capabilities]{.underline}. A [Pentagon study]{.underline} on
Taiwan's air power [recommends selling Taiwan the more advanced U.S.
F-35 joint strike fighter]{.underline}. It signals that the U.S.
administration knows full well **[the F-35 is what Taiwan
needs]{.underline}**, but the sale would require a comprehensive rethink
on Taiwan at the Pentagon. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. is
obligated to supply Taiwan with all necessary weapons to organize a
sufficient defense. [There is no question that a request for F-35 is
within the letter of this law, making any sale consistent with the
precepts of U.S. policy]{.underline}. Although U.S. relations with
Taiwan are stronger than ever, [Taiwan still faces a precarious
situation, following Beijing's announcement of the creation of an
extended A]{.underline}ir [D]{.underline}efense
[I]{.underline}dentification [Z]{.underline}one [in the
E]{.underline}ast [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, coupled with
rising tensions over maritime and territorial disputes in the South
China Sea. Why should the U.S. care? Because of the relationship between
the U.S. and Taiwan is a cornerstone of foreign policy in the region.
**[Taiwan has a role to play in maintaining regional
peace]{.underline}**, [and the U.S. should continue to help Taiwan
maintain an effective deterrent]{.underline}. Indeed, there is
voluminous evidence that **[U.S. arms sales improve cross-Strait
stability]{.underline}** [by deterring the mainland from using military
force while also giving Taipei the much-needed security it requires to
engage the mainland]{.underline} with a diminished fear of attack or
coercion. Moreover, Taiwan has the ability to play an important role in
Washington's rebalancing strategy. The Obama administration's pivot to
Asia aims to improve security and prosperity in the region. It is clear
that Washington and Beijing must find ways to cooperate on issues of
mutual interest, and avoid competitive or confrontational issues
wherever possible. Because of its proximity to and knowledge of China,
[Taiwan is uniquely equipped to assist U.S. efforts in this
regard]{.underline}. Rather than fearing possible damage to bilateral
ties with China, the U.S. should take advantage of the benefits this
important partnership can offer. The rise of China is disrupting the
balance of power in the Pacific. **[Making the F-35 available to Taiwan
would allow its air force to execute missions effectively]{.underline}**
not only **[today]{.underline}**, but well into the future. [A strong
Taiwan confident in its relationship with the U.S. is key to peace and
security in East Asia]{.underline}, and is thus of profound importance
to the U.S. Sources in both Taiwan and the U.S. indicate that [Taiwan is
in urgent need of advanced jet fighters for its
self-defense]{.underline}. [If the U.S. is seeking to maintain the
status quo with Taiwan]{.underline}, **[it should approve the sale of
the F-35 at the earliest opportunity]{.underline}**.

### TMC Key

#### Specifically, boosting the TMC is key to deter China from attacking.

(Grant and Kerry, "Saving Taiwan\'s Marine Corps",
https://thediplomat.com/2015/11/saving-the-taiwan-marine-corps/)//GA

Taiwan Marine Corps' Amphibious Role -- Keep It Keep the TMC's
amphibious capability and mission. For Taiwan, **[amphibious assault is
still feasible in most scenarios]{.underline}**, [except for an assault
against a well-defended coastline or in an extremely high-threat
environment far from Taiwan]{.underline}. There are a number of ways to
employ a properly sized and equipped amphibious force in a
counter-attack role in the context of a strategic defense of Taiwan. An
amphibious capability is also indispensable in Humanitarian
Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) operations. Although [war in East
Asia is not unthinkable, particularly in light of the PRC's increasing
bellicosity and acquisitive actions in the region]{.underline}, Taiwan
has not had to fight pitched battles for decades. However, natural
disasters frequently occur in Taiwan and the region, and HA/DR alone
warrants an amphibious capability. The TMC, operating with Taiwan Navy
(TN) amphibious ships, is the ideal force to spearhead HA/DR efforts as
it combines sea/ground/air capabilities and is able to move rapidly with
substantial supplies, equipment, and personnel to affected locations --
both domestically and regionally. The TMC has already proved its
usefulness in domestic HA/DR on a number of occasions, to include the
2009 flooding when TMC amphibious assault vehicles (AAVs) were the only
vehicles capable of accessing certain afflicted areas. The TMC's AAVs
are old, but they still have life in them. When newer versions of
amphibious vehicles are developed overseas, the Taiwan Marines should
acquire them. Engage in Regional HA/DR Support Looking beyond Taiwan,
one notes that the majority of regional natural disasters require an
amphibious response. Following the TMC's transformation into MAGTFs, [it
must learn to work with the Taiwan Navy to build a truly amphibious
force along the lines of the U.S. "Marine Expeditionary
Unit"]{.underline} (MEU). A MEU is a combination of amphibious ships
with Marines and their logistics and organic aviation assets aboard,
trained, equipped, and ready to join fully in regional HA/DR missions
and training exercises. Taiwan's involvement in regional disaster
response operations to date has been limited. Generally speaking, the
Taiwan Air Force flies in relief supplies and goes home -- leaving a
handful of Taiwanese civilians behind to handle relief operations. This
concept is outdated, and serves only to keep Taiwan isolated and
marginalized in the international arena. When physically and politically
possible, Taiwan Armed Forces (Marines and Navy taking the lead) should
get directly involved on the ground. Beyond obvious foreign policy
benefits, this approach has practical operational benefits. For example,
[the Taiwan military]{.underline} (with its organization, manpower, and
equipment) [gets practical experience assisting the overall relief
effort and ensures that supplies and aid are used properly]{.underline}.
As importantly, Taiwan gets greater visibility (and, hence credit) for
humanitarian activities with the attendant political benefits. This
political angle to HA/DR also applies domestically as well, since
failure to effectively respond to local disasters discredits both the
Ministry of National Defense and whatever administration is in power.
One anticipates criticism from certain quarters of Taiwan Armed Forces'
more active role in regional humanitarian activities. However, those
who've been involved in disaster relief understand that the victims
don't care where help comes from. Strengthen Specialized Roles for TMC
Besides reorganizing and improving mobility and maintaining an
amphibious capability, **[the Taiwan Marine Corps can also strengthen
Taiwan's overall defense by improving or taking on]{.underline}** the
following **[specialized roles]{.underline}**. These roles will directly
support Taiwan Ministry of National Defense plans for an "asymmetric"
defense of Taiwan. Become the MOUT (Military Operations in Urban
Terrain) specialists. Taiwan's terrain is either vertical or it is
urbanized, particularly in central and northern parts of the island. A
[MOUT capability is essential to defending Taiwan, and is a specialized
skill that requires focused, complex training]{.underline}. The [Taiwan
Marines have already developed considerable expertise in MOUT and should
enhance and expand these capabilities]{.underline}. Transition to light
artillery and ASCM (anti-ship cruise missiles) missions. Replace the
TMC's heavy, self-propelled artillery with light, mobile artillery, and
take advantage of advances in precision-guided munitions. Taiwan Marines
might also adopt the ASCM and establish anti-ship cruise missile units.
Land based, mobile, and easily concealed, ASCMs are almost impossible to
destroy from the air while giving an attacking naval force migraines.
[ASCMs are a perfect weapon for the TMC, with its littoral warfare
expertise]{.underline}. Sea-going by nature, Taiwan Marines might
potentially operate ASCMs aboard Taiwan Navy ships. Expand ANGLICO
(Air-Naval Gunfire Liaison Company) capabilities. **[Taiwan Marines are
already proficient in coordinating combined arms]{.underline}** -- air,
artillery, naval surface, and ground fires. The TMC can expand this
capability -- and improve overall lethality -- by deploying ANGLICO
teams throughout the entire Taiwan Armed Forces Develop an armored
capability based on the USMC's Light Armored Vehicle (LAV). The wheeled
LAV-25 (and its variants) would give the Taiwan Marines an added
dimension of agility, high maneuverability and firepower -- all of which
are necessary attributes for a newly designed TMC. The [LAV's core
mission sets are Security Missions, which provide the commander with
early warning, allowing him to concentrate combat power at the right
place and time]{.underline}. Such economy of force missions are, again,
perfectly suited for the TMC and defense of Taiwan. Improve TMC's Air
Defense role. TMC has played a role in air defense for years, but in a
static way. Instead, the Taiwan Marines deploying shoulder-fired
surface-to-air missiles and other mobile SAM systems can provide a
highly mobile air defense capability, thereby complicating PRC targeting
of Taiwan's AAA capabilities by PLA missiles, aircraft, and Special
Operations teams and sleeper agent cells. Take on Mine Warfare
specialty. Sea mine technology has improved markedly in recent times, to
include "smart" mines. Properly employed, these cheap, highly effective
weapons are particularly valuable in defending Taiwan, and are a role
TMC might take on given their expertise in littoral operations and boat
operations. Maintain and upgrade TMC Amphibious Reconnaissance Group
(ARG). The Amphibious Reconnaissance Group (ARG) Marines are tough
customers able to do the "sexy stuff" -- parachuting, ocean swimming,
SCUBA, etc. -- along with their main mission of serving as "eyes and
ears" in the ocean, on the beach, and on land and direct action
missions. [Special Forces such as the ARG are potentially an asymmetric
force multiplier, but they need appropriate doctrine and to be properly
trained and employed]{.underline}. Like much of the Taiwan Armed Forces,
the ARG suffer from professional isolation -- lack of exposure to other
militaries. In addition to developing opportunities to interact with
other foreign special operations units, the Amphibious Reconnaissance
Group could use a thorough outside review of its doctrine, missions, and
employment concepts. The Taiwan Marines' Road Ahead: The Path to
Asymmetric Warfare Success First, end the Taiwan Marine Corps'
isolation. Decades of near-isolation and **[lack of interaction with
other militaries have resulted in a less-capable Taiwan Marines
Corps]{.underline}** -- and the Taiwan Military writ large. [The United
States can]{.underline}, and should, [take the lead in this regard --
and has at least nominally stated its intention to do so]{.underline}.
The U.S. National Defense Authorization Act 2016 (NDAA 2016) states that
"[military forces of Taiwan should be permitted to participate in
bilateral training activities hosted by the United States that increase
credible deterrent capabilities of Taiwan]{.underline}." Moreover, NDAA
2016 also notes that "**[the United States should continue to support
the efforts of Taiwan to integrate innovative and asymmetric measures to
balance the growing military capabilities of the People's Republic of
China]{.underline}**...." A re-shaped and re-purposed Taiwan Marine
Corps certainly qualifies as an asymmetric and innovative measure. The
U.S. Marines and U.S. Navy in particular should be allowed to bring the
TMC (and Taiwan Navy) back into the fold -- particularly for HA/DR
operations. As a first step, the [U.S. Marine Corps should send one or
two Mandarin-speaking officers as Liaison Officers to the Taiwan Marine
Corps, as it has done in sending LNOs to the Japan Ground Self Defense
Force and other regional militaries]{.underline}.

### 2NC Solvency 

#### The CP is the best way to deter China but also ensure survival of Taiwan.

**Chase**, senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation,
2/26/**19**

(Michael, "Averting a Cross-Strait Crisis",
https://www.cfr.org/report/averting-cross-strait-crisis)//GA

[Recommendations]{.underline} The situation across the Taiwan Strait is
changing for several reasons, and [the danger of a crisis appears to be
growing as Taiwan's 2020 elections approach]{.underline}. **[Washington
should aim to strengthen deterrence]{.underline}** [while working within
the context of a long-standing policy that helps maintain stability and
affords considerable flexibility]{.underline}. Within this context,
**[the United States is unlikely to facilitate a major breakthrough in
cross-strait relations]{.underline}**, [though it should do what it can
to prevent them from worsening]{.underline}. Because this is a sensitive
time in cross-strait relations, careful diplomacy and stewardship are
required to reduce the risk of crisis. In particular, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should encourage China and
Taiwan to maintain a stable and constructive cross-strait relationship
on terms consistent with the interests and aspirations of the people of
Taiwan]{.underline}, primarily by reiterating clearly and publicly its
opposition to unilateral actions altering the status quo. Unlike a
decade ago, however, **[the U.S. response will need to take into account
that unilateral action by the mainland appears to be a much greater
threat than Taiwan's crossing a line]{.underline}** [that triggers a
Chinese response]{.underline}. The [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should also develop a multidimensional approach to
enhancing its relationship with Taiwan]{.underline} and strengthening
Taiwan's resilience and ability to deter Chinese coercion, as detailed
below. Because escalating Chinese pressure presents a multifaceted
threat to Taiwan, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should
think more broadly about how to help Taiwan **strengthen deterrence and
increase its resilience**]{.underline}. Since [Beijing would likely rely
on a strategy that incorporates a variety of diplomatic, economic,
military, and informational instruments of power]{.underline},
Washington should develop an approach that accounts for the challenges
presented by all of the different elements of a Chinese coercion
campaign against Taiwan. The overall goals should be to help Taiwan
mitigate its vulnerabilities and to convince China that it would be
unable to use its leverage against Taiwan in any of these areas without
taking large risks. To counter Chinese diplomatic isolation, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should continue to support
Taiwan's participation in international organizations such as the
International Civil Aviation Organization, Interpol, and the
W]{.underline}orld [H]{.underline}ealth [O]{.underline}rganization, and
expand successful initiatives such as the Global Cooperation and
Training Framework. The United States should also do more to facilitate
Taiwan's efforts to deepen strategic dialogues and exchanges with other
democracies, including Australia and Japan. To bolster Taiwan's
deterrence posture, **[the United States should continue arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}** and assist Taiwan in its attempts to strengthen
its domestic defense industry. The **[United States should also enhance
support for Taiwan's efforts to develop and implement a new defense
strategy, strengthen its reserve forces, and reform its military service
system]{.underline}**. In return, the [United States should expect
Taiwan to increase its defense spending and focus on implementation of
its new Overall Defense Concept]{.underline}, which emphasizes
asymmetric responses to China's growing military power, including more
mobile and survivable systems. The [United States should also aid
Taiwan's efforts to diversify its economic relationships and reduce its
economic dependence on China]{.underline}. This assistance could include
supporting President Tsai's New Southbound Policy, which is intended to
enhance Taiwan's economic ties with the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), Australia, New Zealand, and South Asian states. In
addition, it could include pursuing a U.S.-Taiwan trade agreement or
supporting Taiwan's desire to participate in CPTPP. The United States
should explore additional ways to help Taiwan. [The United States should
explore additional ways to help Taiwan increase its ability to uncover
and counter Chinese information warfare and political influence
operations]{.underline}. Some of this help might need to be provided
behind the scenes for it to be effective, but when possible the United
States should consider publicizing what it knows about Chinese
operations and publicly highlighting its willingness and ability to work
with Taiwan to diminish their damage. The [United States should also
encourage other countries that have experience in countering Chinese or
Russian influence operations, such as Australia and France, to
coordinate and work with Taiwan to help build its capacity to respond to
such activities]{.underline}. The **[United States should further
strengthen its own deterrence and defense capabilities and emphasize a
deterrence-by-denial approach against China]{.underline}**. This
[approach would likely be more credible than a deterrence approach that
is premised on the threat of punishment and would also ensure that the
United States is prepared to defend Taiwan if deterrence
fails]{.underline}. Moreover, Washington should clearly communicate to
Beijing that it is updating its own operational concepts and military
capabilities in response to improvements in Chinese military power.
Specifically, th[e United States should display new capabilities and
conduct exercises in ways that are designed to show China that **the
United States will be able to counter Chinese use of force against
Taiwan**]{.underline}, if necessary. In addition, **[Washington should
try to induce caution on Beijing's part by signaling that China would be
unable to ensure a fast and decisive resolution on its
terms]{.underline}**, or to control escalation with the level of
confidence some Chinese strategists have suggested would be the case in
the event of a regional conflict.

**[Taiwan's military must feel pressured on two fronts these
days]{.underline}**. Chinese [P]{.underline}eople's
[L]{.underline}iberation [A]{.underline}rmy [jets and ships routinely
menace]{.underline}, [while the Americans routinely
nag]{.underline}---with the best of intentions of course. Beyond the
advice always gushing forth from Washington-based think tanks and
pundits, [Americans are shuttling through Taipei offering
guidance]{.underline}: Spend more on defense . . . become a "porcupine"
. . . buy this . . . don't buy that . . . do this . . . don't do that .
. . Taiwan might feel like saying: "We get it . . . now how about
letting us train and exercise with you?" **[U.S. policy
has]{.underline}**---even if not always intentionally---**[isolated
Taiwan's military]{.underline}** [over the forty years since Washington
shifted diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing]{.underline}. Arms
are grudgingly doled out---as typified by the Obama administration's
single arms sale to Taiwan in eight years. And [there are strict
American-imposed limits on military to military interaction---to the
point Taiwan and U.S. service members wear civilian clothes when
visiting each other's countries]{.underline}. Taiwan [military personnel
do attend U.S. service schools]{.underline} and there are frequent
consultations and discussions between the militaries, along with
observation teams sent to watch each other's exercises. And American
trainers conduct skills training in Taiwan, while Taiwan Air Force F-16
pilots receive training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona. But [the
Americans won't actually do joint exercises or
operations]{.underline}---[and that's a necessity for Taiwan's
military]{.underline}---[as it is for any military seeking to maintain
or improve capabilities]{.underline}. This is particularly so for a
small force that depends on outside support. As a result, **[Taiwan's
armed forces are something of a "Galapagos military."]{.underline}**
Against the odds, [they are still highly professional, but not as
capable as they should be]{.underline}. And [one wonders how well Taiwan
and U.S. forces can defend Taiwan if they never practice outside
tabletop exercise---and sometimes seem afraid to be seen
together]{.underline}. This brings to mind a baseball team that never
plays other teams. Instead, it's "chalk talks" and intra-squad games
using equipment that it scrounged up. This [decades-long isolation also
demoralizes the Taiwan military]{.underline}---[while reducing public
confidence in the military]{.underline}. And both the Taiwan government
and the public wonder if the Americans can really be counted on. Even
worse, **[Beijing reckons that if it keeps tightening the screws on
Taiwan and creates an overwhelming military imbalance the Americans will
back off]{.underline}** when the time comes---[figuring the price is too
high]{.underline}. And by now, Taiwanese might even feel numb to these
American professions of support---without more tangible evidence of
commitment---particularly joint exercises. And they may even think, "why
bother defending ourselves?" Washington took a step in the right
direction in 2017 when a platoon of Taiwan Marines trained with U.S.
Marines in Hawaii. But then the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[squandered an opportunity to invite Taiwan to the RIMPAC 2018 exercise
after withdrawing the PRC's invitation]{.underline}. Indeed, local
representatives from the Taiwan Economic and Culture Office in Honolulu
were not even allowed the watch the exercise. U.S. government officials
might usefully remember that they represent the United States of
America---still the world's most powerful nation---and can decide who
they associate with. [The PRC will complain. It always
does]{.underline}. But **[Washington's fear of joint training is
evidence Beijing still has a veto on U.S. behavior towards
Taiwan]{.underline}**---and has for decades---aided and abetted by the
U.S. State Department and U.S. administrations (of both parties) and the
"business lobby." The [Pentagon hasn't exactly fought hard to change
things either]{.underline}. Paradoxically, [support for Taiwan is
practically the only subject for which there is overwhelming and
bipartisan congressional support]{.underline}. The Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) was in fact enacted in 1979 out of fear a President might sell out
Taiwan. And National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA's) since at least
2017 specifically call for joint exercises with Taiwan. [Yet almost
nothing has happened]{.underline}. Meanwhile, U[.S. forces conduct
military exercises in the Baltic States that Russia appears to
covet.]{.underline} And Vladimir [Putin is no less scary than
Xi]{.underline} Jinping. But Russia doesn't make what Wal-Mart
sells---nor is it viewed as a magical place where foreign businessmen
believe they will get rich selling one of something to every Chinese
person. **[The United States must take the first step]{.underline}**.
It's the big guy backing up a smaller friend facing a powerful bully.
Indeed, [treat Taiwan like a real ally and the Taiwanese public just
might start thinking the Americans are serious]{.underline}. Sending
generals and admirals to visit Taiwan and holding more consultations and
gift exchanges isn't what's needed. That's a bigger deal to the
Americans than to Taiwan or China. [What's needed is something
substantial that demonstrates commitment and draws Taiwan's military out
of isolation]{.underline}. Here is a suggestion: [Create a Central
Pacific]{.underline} Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief
([HA/DR]{.underline}) [Force]{.underline}---[using U.S. and Taiwan
amphibious forces to plan, train, and exercise for HA/DR
operations]{.underline}---and respond when disasters occur---as they
always do in the region. [Locate the outfit in Taiwan and attach U.S.
officers]{.underline}---perhaps from the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet and
31st Marine Expeditionary Unit [that are well-versed and prepared for
disaster response]{.underline}. Taiwan already has excellent HA/DR
capabilities---combining both civilian and military resources. While
making use of civilian resources, this should be a military to military
based effort. For one thing, militaries have the necessary personnel,
hardware, equipment, and organization. And if it's exclusively a
"civilian" effort---in hopes Beijing won't object---that suggests
ongoing fear of Beijing and that Chinese deterrence is working nicely.
An advantage of using amphibious forces is that it's the equivalent of
CrossFit training---exercising air, sea, and ground capabilities at the
same time. And **[it exercises skills that are the same as for "regular"
military operations]{.underline}**---except for the shooting. Do some of
this joint training and [Taiwan military skills will **improve in short
order**---while also improving the ability to operate with American
forces---and vice versa]{.underline}. The U.S. territory of Guam is a
perfect training location, and there are other locales elsewhere in the
South Pacific where Taiwan still has diplomatic allies. To bring this to
fruition will require Taiwan liaison officers at American headquarters
in Hawaii. And the Americans can assign Chinese-speaking Marines and
Navy officers as liaison officers to Taiwan forces. And [each nation's
amphibious ships making port calls in each other's ports will be a
natural outcome as well]{.underline}. Expect political and psychological
knock-on effects in Taiwan, Washington, Beijing, and regionally.
**[People will see Americans are serious. Adversaries might reckon
they've underestimated U.S. resolve]{.underline}**. And friends like
[Australia, Japan, or the French and British might get
involved]{.underline}. And maybe a few "undecided" nations will come
down off the fence. There is precedent for all this. [Taiwan Navy ships
and Air Force C-130s delivered emergency supplies to the Philippines in
2013 after Typhoon Haiyan]{.underline}. And more recently, Taiwan
military medical staff joined in U.S.-led HA/DR exercises in Kiribati in
2017 and the Solomon Islands in 2018---both nations that recognize
Taiwan. In 2009, the USS Denver amphibious ship with heavy-lift
helicopters provided assistance to Taiwan following Typhoon Morakot. A
Central Pacific HA/DR Force also addresses an oft-heard complaint in
Washington that "Taiwan won't fight." But [how does anyone
know]{.underline}---[until Taiwan's military is treated like an ally and
gets a fair chance to show what it can do?]{.underline} [Taipei's
government does need clearer thinking on defense strategy]{.underline}
and to spend more money on defense---and to spend it properly. Making
military service an attractive and respected profession ought to be as
much a priority as new hardware. But **[the United States can encourage
and bolster Taiwan's effort by inviting the military to "come out and
play."]{.underline}** Even before an HA/DR force comes to pass, with
some effort and imagination [it's possible to arrange joint training

[Impatient]{.underline} --- [and determined to exert control over the
island]{.underline} --- [Beijing has employed political and military
means to isolate and intimidate Taiwan]{.underline}. First, [Beijing has
pressed countries to cut ties with Taiwan]{.underline}. In 2018 alone,
China successfully pressured three more countries to sever Taiwanese
relations, leaving only 17 that recognize the island's government.
Taiwan's diplomatic isolation makes American support all the more
important. More dangerously, [due primarily to its extraordinary
military buildup, **Beijing is moving ever closer** to an ability to
successfully invade the island]{.underline}. The U.S. Defense
Department's Indo-Pacific Strategy Report released this month notes that
"[China has never renounced the use of military force against Taiwan,
and continues to develop and deploy advanced military capabilities
needed for a potential military campaign]{.underline}." Indeed, as
demonstrated by an increased number of military exercises near Taiwan,
the report warns that **[the P]{.underline}**eople's
**[L]{.underline}**iberation **[A]{.underline}**rmy **[is]{.underline}**
"**[preparing for a contingency to unify Taiwan with the mainland by
force]{.underline}**." In the past, Taiwan's superior technology and
geography gave Taiwan a military edge when it came to a potential
conflict in the strait. However, as the Pentagon noted, [due to China's
military buildup, those advantages are now largely gone]{.underline}. In
fact, as the Defense Intelligence Agency's 2019 report on Chinese
military power assessed, "Beijing's longstanding interest to eventually
compel Taiwan's reunification with the mainland and deter any attempt by
Taiwan to declare independence has served as the primary driver for
China's military modernization." Simultaneously, based on an overzealous
and counterproductive desire in previous administrations to avoid
offending Beijing, [Washington has often been reluctant to provide
Taiwan the arms it needed]{.underline}. Fearful to not provoke the
Chinese, the [Obama]{.underline} administration [rejected Taiwanese
requests for 66 new F-16 fighter jets]{.underline} --- [instead only
offering modifications for its aging aircraft]{.underline}. Admittedly,
America's arms sales to Taiwan are relatively modest compared to China's
military buildup. However, **[the failure to provide Taiwan the required
weapons exacerbated the shift toward Beijing in the military
balance]{.underline}**. As a result, across most combat domains,
[Beijing has established both a quantitative and qualitative advantage
over Taiwan]{.underline}. **[Consequently, there is a risk that Beijing
planners and decision-makers might determine they could launch a
successful offensive against Taiwan]{.underline}**. That **[perception
in Beijing makes aggression in the strait and a war with the United
States more likely]{.underline}**. The bipartisan National Defense
Strategy Commission listed aggression against Taiwan as a top concern,
arguing that [allowing China to absorb Taiwan by military force would
constitute a]{.underline} "[crushing blow to America's credibility and
regional position]{.underline}." In addition to genuine hard-power
concerns, there is also a matter of principle. When an authoritarian
power threatens and bullies a democratic people, America is not neutral.
Furthermore, [providing Taiwan the means to defend itself is not just
consistent with sound policy and good principle]{.underline} --- [it is
the law]{.underline}. The Taiwan Relations Act made clear that the
establishment of diplomatic relations with Beijing rested on the
expectation that the future of Taiwan would be "determined by peaceful
means." [To make this a reality, the law says the U.S. will provide the
weapons "necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability."]{.underline} Admittedly, successive U.S.
administrations have interpreted and implemented this rather vague
statute differently. However, [what seems clear is that Taiwan's ability
to defend itself against an increasingly belligerent and capable
military threat from the mainland is in doubt]{.underline}. That would
suggest that the current arms package under consideration is not only
permissible and advisable under the law, but essential. The
administration deserves credit for expanding freedom of navigation
operations in the Taiwan Strait and, at least initially, asking Congress
to support new arms sales to Taiwan. Those are **[good first
steps]{.underline}**, but they **[are not enough]{.underline}**. In
addition to providing these arms without delay and stopping the erosion
of U.S. military superiority vis-a-vis China, **[Washington should also
provide Taiwan the fighter aircraft and other weapons it needs to make
Beijing think twice before undertaking aggression in the
strait]{.underline}**.

Notwithstanding Washington drama and parlor games, the [biggest story of
the decade is that America's response to China's economic and military
aggression has changed dramatically]{.underline}. With bipartisan
support in Congress, President Donald [Trump has moved forcefully to
toughen allied solidarity in the Pacific and to resist Chinese economic
warfare]{.underline}. But **[Washington has overlooked one key asset in
this fight---Taiwan]{.underline}**---and often instead mistook it for a
liability. This distinction is fundamentally important as we ponder the
durability of the Chinese Communist Party amid an economic slowdown and
as the world marks the thirtieth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square
Massacre this week. [The island nation of twenty-four million free
people is frequently threatened by China with reunification---a
euphemism for military invasion and conquest]{.underline}, and an end to
the de facto political independence that Taiwan has enjoyed since 1949.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates doesn't have a mutual
defense treaty with Taiwan, but it [is bound by a 1979 law to sell it
the arms it needs for its defense]{.underline}---a standard previous
U.S. administrations have usually failed to meet. Previous U.S.
messaging has also been dubious. For example, in 2004, Secretary of
State Colin Powell went to Beijing and asserted that Taiwan wasn't a
sovereign nation. Additionally, Powell said the United States sought the
"peaceful reunification" of Taiwan and China. In other words, leave your
freedom at the door. [Armchair experts who have skimmed the Wikipedia
entry on Chinese culture observe that Beijing's rulers cannot afford to
"lose face," which would occur if Taiwan were to declare independence
formally]{.underline}. Fair enough, but [this sentiment is frequently
extended radically to areas where Taiwan is left unable to secure its
national interests]{.underline}. **[Every year, China enhances its
offensive military posture against Taiwan]{.underline}**. Beijing also
picks off more of the handful of remaining minor nations that have
formal relations with Taiwan instead of China. [This is important to
note because official foreign relations are necessary for Taiwanese
leaders to visit America (seldom Washington, DC) under the artifice of a
"transit stop" on their way to state visits elsewhere]{.underline}.
Moreover, China prevents Taiwan from entering multilateral forums like
the World Health Organization, and Taiwan's status as something other
than a real country often prevents it from securing trade deals with
other nations or economic blocs like the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations. On top of that, experts dismiss Taiwan's protestations and
efforts to rectify these problems as dangerously provocative toward
China. [Past U.S. presidents of both parties have effectively adopted
what Bill Clinton's top Asia policy official called]{.underline}
"[strategic ambiguity]{.underline}." When Chinese officials asked Joseph
Nye what the United States would do if they attacked Taiwan, he said,
"[We don't know and you don't know. It would depend on the
circumstances]{.underline}." An endless academic debate over whether to
make formal our implicit likelihood to come to Taiwan's defense---and
whether this would increase or decrease the chances of peace or create a
moral hazard---has led nowhere. **[It's time to change the premise of
the debate]{.underline}**. Even without formally dispensing with the
fiction of our forty-year-old "One-China Policy," which supposes there
is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of it, [American
policymakers can take a very different view of Taiwan that serves U.S.
interests]{.underline}. Most fundamentally, [Washington should see
Taiwan as a free society that puts the lie to the C]{.underline}hinese
[C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty['s]{.underline} [ultimate
claim of legitimacy]{.underline}. Throughout its seventy years of rule,
the Party has justified its totalitarianism on the basis that any other
form of government would lead to chaos and corruption---features that
marked much of China's history and which some historians blame for why
greatness and global power have eluded the world's most populous nation.
Taiwan is a living rebuke of this fiction. It shows that an ethnically
Chinese-majority country can achieve stability and prosperity through
democracy and the rule of law. Since Taiwan evolved into a full
democracy in 1996, [it has had three peaceful changes of power between
political parties and its per capita income has grown to more than
\$50,000---now ranked twenty-eighth in the world]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [Taipei has achieved this despite persistent threats and
intimidation from Beijing]{.underline}. Also, Taiwan elected the first
woman head of state in Asia who was not the relative or spouse of a
previous president. It has grown from an impoverished low-tech
manufacturing center to a diversified economy and creative society. Last
month it became the first Asian country to legalize gay marriage, and
unlike the United States, did so through a vote of its national
legislature. [Taiwan also protects the rights of ethnic and religious
minorities, whereas China may have as many as three million Muslims in
political reeducation camps at the present time]{.underline}.
Democratization has allowed Taiwanese to develop a pro-Taiwan identity
that no longer rests on a thin, race-based notion of ethnicity. In
addition, like most democracies, **[Taiwan seeks peace with its
neighbors]{.underline}**. Every time that Chinese officials rationalize
or justify the subservience of law to the whims of the Party, every time
they lock someone up for having the wrong views or worshipping the wrong
God, every time they run over protesters with tanks in the name of
social harmony, every time they threaten their neighbors with military
force, [Taiwan stands as an example of a different and better way for
ethnically Chinese citizens to govern themselves]{.underline}. In the
free world's long competition with China's government, [America should
put Taiwan in the spotlight, not treat it like a liability]{.underline}.
It represents the future everyone should want for China---a future that
would be marked by collaboration rather than confrontation with America
and the rest of the free world. For starters, [**Washington should put
an end to infantile diplomatic insults to Taiwan**, like prohibiting
Taiwanese exchange cadets at U.S. service academies from wearing their
uniforms, and not allowing Taiwanese diplomats to come to important
meetings at the White House, State Department, and
Pentagon]{.underline}. America should call its respective embassies and
ambassadors what they are instead of the stepchild legation known as the
"American Institute in Taiwan," and get rid of its useless domestic
outpost in Arlington, Virginia. [Consider the advanced talks Washington
has held with Iran and North Korea---countries with which America does
not have formal diplomatic relations. Surely the United States can
afford the same courtesy to a democratic friend]{.underline}.
**[Policymakers should also implement congressional legislation that
calls for exchanges of senior members of each country's government,
including military flag officers]{.underline}**. The forced estrangement
of the U.S. and Taiwanese militaries is dangerous and leaves an obvious
force-multiplier against Beijing gathering dust on a shelf---what is
needed is a joint command like the ones America has with Japan and South
Korea. Finally, Washington should negotiate a formal trade agreement
with Taiwan. This too can be a model for China, considering it could
include all of the intellectual property protections and other
provisions to which Beijing has balked at agreeing. None of this amounts
to a "regime change" policy toward China per se. But it would reprise
the nonviolent cultural warfare America waged against the Soviet Union
even as Washington negotiated at times with Moscow during the Cold War.
Spotlighting the benefits of an alternative to your opponent's political
system can be smart statecraft. In America's long contest with China's
government, Washington should do so whenever practicable.

https://www.americanactionforum.org/insight/five-things-that-should-be-in-the-us-arms-sale-to-taiwan/)//GA

When [the United States]{.underline} established diplomatic relations
with the People's Republic of China, it [severed official diplomatic
ties with Taiwan]{.underline}, which it had previously recognized as the
government of China. [Congress passed the TRA to facilitate continued
non-diplomatic relations between America and Taiwan and help maintain
peace and security in the region]{.underline}. One important aspect of
the TRA is that it requires the United States to "make available to
Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as
may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability." Since 1979, [every president has announced multiple arms
sales to Taiwan]{.underline}. The Obama Administration has sold \$12
billion worth of military equipment to Taiwan, but the four-year break
led to bipartisan pressure from Congress to announce another round of
sales. The reported \$1 billion in new arms sales to Taiwan would
relieve congressional pressure but would also be likely to increase
tension in the U.S.-China relationship. The [Chinese
government]{.underline}, which opposes the sale of military equipment to
Taiwan, [usually responds negatively to arms deal
announcements]{.underline}. China often cancels upcoming military
exchanges with the United States but is unlikely to respond by
fundamentally challenging American interests because of arms sales to
Taiwan. The **[purpose of U.S. arms sales is to enable Taiwan to ensure
its own self-defense]{.underline}**. Fundamentally, **[Taiwan's defense
strategy should focus on making a potential attack cost-prohibitive for
China. Therefore, Taiwanese arms purchases should raise the costs of
Chinese offensive action]{.underline}**. [Since China's recent military
buildup poses a multi-faceted threat, Taiwan should make military
investments with regard to land, sea, and air capabilities---with a
particular focus on asymmetric systems]{.underline}, which are
inexpensive weapons capable of taking on much more expensive systems.
With that in mind, here are five things that should be in the new
package of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan: [1. Anti-Ship & Anti-Submarine
Capabilities]{.underline} [Much of the Chinese military buildup has been
focused on naval capabilities]{.underline}. Therefore, [small missile
frigates are indispensable, and selling Taiwan more of these ships would
strengthen its defense]{.underline}. Undersea [mines would also be an
inexpensive but highly effective system for Taiwanese
investment]{.underline}. [Mines would be useful in anti-submarine
warfare]{.underline} as well, especially as China increases in its sub
fleet. [2. Anti-Air Capabilities]{.underline} Another major aspect of
China's military buildup has been modernizing its air forces.
Additionally, [China has an estimated 1,500 short-range ballistic
missiles pointed at Taiwan]{.underline}. In response, [Taiwan should
invest even more heavily in missile defense and anti-aircraft
systems]{.underline}. After purchasing the Patriot Advanced Capability
(PAC) interceptors from the United States, [Taiwan has shown a
commitment to continually upgrading its missile defense, which is among
the most modern systems in the world]{.underline}. **[Selling Taiwan
additional PAC-3 units or]{.underline}** even the Terminal High Altitude
Area Defense (**[THAAD]{.underline}**) **[system would strengthen the
island's anti-air capabilities]{.underline}**. [Surface-to-air
capabilities]{.underline}, such as Stinger missile systems, [could help
support anti-air missions as well]{.underline}. **[3. Anti-Armor
Capabilities]{.underline}** In the event of a worst-case-scenario
Chinese invasion, [Taiwan must continue to invest in land warfare
capabilities]{.underline}. [Anti-tank missiles such as the Javelin and
TOW]{.underline} (tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided) [are an
integral part of Taiwan's ability to deter land forces]{.underline}.
**[4. Soft Capabilities]{.underline}** Harder capabilities are enabled
by intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) assets.
[Improving Taiwan's ISR with long-range early warning radar systems
would help detect potential threats and benefit any future military
operations]{.underline}. 5. Aircraft [For almost 10 years, both the Bush
and Obama Administrations have refused requests from Taiwan to purchase
new aircraft]{.underline}---often despite pressure from Congress.
Taiwan's fleet of F-16s dates back to 1992, but the United States has
only agreed to sell retrofit upgrades to the old planes. **[F-16s are a
relatively low-cost aircraft for the capabilities they provide, and
selling Taiwan new planes would significantly bolster its defense
arsenal]{.underline}**.

**[China is building up its capabilities to invade
Taiwan]{.underline}**, [according to US intelligence]{.underline}, but
[America hasn't sold advanced fighter jets to Taiwan since
1992]{.underline}. As a democratic ally of the United States under
pressure from increasing Chinese aggression, [Taiwan deserves support in
its national defense]{.underline}. Providing it is done in a way that
prioritizes US security interests, President Donald **[Trump should
greenlight the sale of advanced fighters to Taiwan]{.underline}**. Since
2018, [Chinese bombers and warships have continually conducted exercises
near Taiwan and the number of Chinese air patrols off Taiwan's east
coast has quadrupled since last year, a show of force that officials in
Beijing called a warning not to pursue formal independence]{.underline}.
On March 31, [two Chinese J-11 fighter jets crossed the Taiwan Strait's
"median line," sparking a 10-minute standoff with Taiwanese jets in the
island's airspace]{.underline}. The encounter marks one of the most
serious incursions by People's Liberation Army (PLA) fighter jets on the
Taiwanese side of the maritime border this century. Why should the
United States care? [Cross-strait relations have deteriorated since
President Tsai]{.underline} Ing-wen [took office in 2016, with Beijing
using pressure tactics, including threats of military action, to try to
assert its claims over Taiwan]{.underline}. As a global power, [the
United States has an enduring interest in keeping the Indo-Pacific
region stable, free and prosperous]{.underline}. To advance these
objectives, **[the Trump administration will need a coherent strategy to
reassure Indo-Pacific allies]{.underline}** that they can still rely on
an increasingly inward-focused US. [China has purchased 34 powerful
Russian-made Sukhoi Su-35 fighters in recent years]{.underline}. It is
the most potent fighter currently in operation in the Russian air force.
[The Su-35s are key PLA assets, providing China with strong,
multi-layered capabilities for defending its South China Sea claims and
successfully deterring international intervention **if Beijing** chooses
to start a conflict with neighboring countries, or **launches an aerial
offensive against Taiwan**]{.underline}. With Beijing having developed
the Chengdu J-20 aircraft and continuously acquiring Su-35 jets, [the US
must acknowledge the growing gap in air power between Taiwan and
China]{.underline}. China has 2,300 operational combat aircraft while
Taiwan has only 490, so Washington needs to address this great
imbalance. In the past, the US has been committed to assisting Taiwan in
addressing its relative weakness in terms of aircraft numbers through
arms sales and cooperation with Taipei on the development of a
comprehensive defense strategy vis-à-vis China. **[Taiwan's inability to
adequately defend itself poses a threat not just to their own security,
but also to the United States]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} 34

brewing conflicts with other nations over territorial disputes in the
South China Sea]{.underline} The 34 Su-35 fighter jets ensure Chinese
air superiority in the region amid brewing conflicts with other nations
over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. The [Chinese air force
is more structurally advanced, so the tactical situation is unfavorable
for Taiwan, as it is facing a fighter shortage]{.underline}. [Older
aircraft such as the]{.underline} roughly 50 [F-5s and]{.underline} 55
[Mirage 2000s will be phased out within the next five
years]{.underline}. What will remain will be 126 upgraded IDFs and 145
F-16A/B fighters. [Taiwan has initiated an upgrade program for its F-16s
but still wants the US to send 60 F-16V fighters to Taiwan, a transfer
that has been on hold since 2006]{.underline}. Taiwan, which still uses
the F-16A/B, is facing a significant decline in its air-defense
capabilities. A **[Pentagon study on Taiwan's air power recommends
selling it the more advanced fighter]{.underline}**. It signals that the
US administration knows full well that powerful advanced fighters are
what Taiwan needs. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, the US is obligated
to supply Taiwan with all necessary weapons to mount a sufficient
defense. There is no question that a request for advanced fighters is
within the letter of this law, making any sale consistent with the
precepts of US policy. Initially, [Taiwan was seeking to acquire a
high-end, heavy American combat jet, either an advanced derivative of
the F-15EX Eagle heavy air superiority fighter or the stealthy F-35
fifth-generation light multirole fighter]{.underline}. Taipei has
reportedly settled on the F-16V as a less capable alternative. This
notably came as a result of the United States' reluctance to sell its
longstanding ally other higher-end combat jets, which was due to defense
technology security factors. [In contrast to the F-35]{.underline} and
the high-end F-15EX, [the F-16's airframe does not represent a highly
sensitive technology -- even when upgraded to the F-16V
standard]{.underline}. While the F-16V's electronic warfare and radar
systems are high end, [they are arguably no more capable, and in many
ways are inferior, to the jets the PLA already operates -- particularly
new aircraft such as the J-10C and J-20]{.underline}. A recent Pentagon
report further indicates that **[the primary driver of Chinese military
modernization is ensuring force superiority]{.underline}** in the event
of a conflict over Taiwan. [In order to maintain the current Taiwan-US
relationship, the Trump's administration should approve the sale of the
next-generation advanced jet fighters to Taiwan]{.underline}. The
**[United States must stand with Taiwan to ensure that it can defend
itself and that its self-defense capabilities never lag
behind]{.underline}**. The [advanced fighters will ensure the country's
security and secure its democracy. It has become a matter of great
strategic importance to the United States as the Trump administration
reasserts US leadership in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. Taiwan has
made a request to purchase the advanced fighters to replace its aging
planes. [The United States should seriously consider selling advanced
fighters to Taiwan at the earliest opportunity]{.underline}. I honestly
believe that the United States has a significant interest in helping
Taiwan because of its strategic position in the island chain bracketing
China's east coast. **[Selling the advanced fighters to Taiwan to avert
a crisis is clearly in the US interest]{.underline}**. [Trump should
bolster Taiwan's defenses with the sale of advanced fighters, especially
given Chinese efforts to change the cross-Strait status
quo]{.underline}. Given significant developments across the Taiwan
Strait over the past two years, [it is time to sell advanced fighters to
Taiwan]{.underline}.

A **[dozen subs connected with advanced sensors and weapons could
contest the PLAN's control of the waters surrounding
Taiwan]{.underline}**. [No other Taiwanese naval platform could oppose a
maritime blockade as effectively]{.underline}. The [ability of
submarines to act autonomously and stealthily would give Taiwan an
**effective defense against a foreseeable threat**]{.underline}. The
[inability of hostile forces to detect submarines helps assure the
uninterrupted flow of sea-borne commerce]{.underline}. [A modern,
deployable fleet of submarines is critical to the sustained defensive
strategy of Taiwan]{.underline}. Forty-six years ago the Chiang
Ching-kuo administration and the Ministry of Defense presented plans for
a dozen submarines. That request reflected the desire for an improved
defensive capability as the U.S. was withdrawing forces from the region.
[Taiwan saw the sea control ability of submarines as a
necessity]{.underline}. For 40 years, Taiwan has faced constant
obstacles and interference in acquiring this capability. [Last year
Taiwan stood at a crossroads. One path was to continue the pursuit of
foreign-constructed submarines]{.underline}. This had so far yielded
nothing. [The other was indigenous development. The Ministry of Defense
announced that Taiwan would build its own submarines]{.underline}. **[A
developed submarine capability would greatly enhance Taiwan's existing
maritime abilities]{.underline}**. [Taiwan's navy has an extensive
network of land, air, and sea-based radars, sonar arrays, imagery
intelligence assets, and signal intelligence platforms that can track
PRC maritime moment]{.underline}. A Project 2049 report shows that
[Taiwanese signals intelligence capabilities allow an unrivaled
collection of information on PRC maritime activity by collecting an
immense amount of information emitted by PRC satellites, military
radios, air defense radars, and electric systems aboard aircraft, ships,
and submarines]{.underline}. Taiwan's anti-submarine aircraft fleets
provide the ROCN with an extensive maritime awareness. The large amount
of collected data allows Taiwan to produce a detailed picture of the
seas around Taiwan and provide the air force, army, and coast guard with
useful tactical intelligence. A **[fleet of submarines would multiply
this intelligence capability and help deter a potential
enemy]{.underline}**. Taiwan's attempt to purchase submarines has become
a lengthy saga. After receiving four decommissioned submarines from the
United States and Holland, [Taiwan's vision of a 12 boat fleet has
remained largely unrealized]{.underline}. Despite PRC protests, Taiwan
searched the world to accomplish the mission. Most submarine-producing
countries have continued to operate within the constraints of the
Shanghai Communique of 1972 in which the U.S. acknowledged the
"One-China" policy. Talks between Holland and Taiwan date back to 1981
when the Dutch company Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappji B.V.
Submarines (RDM) signed a contract that delivered Taiwan its two Hai
Lung-class vessels. The PRC feared submarines more than any other
defensive ability of the RoCN and sought to prevent possible deals. When
Holland agreed to sell the submarines in the early 80's it faced
immediate pressure from China, which threatened Holland with economic
and diplomatic sanctions. The pressure concluded with the so-called
"Gentleman's Agreement" of 1994 in which the Dutch promised not to sell
any "strategic" items to Taiwan. The remaining submarine-producing
nations have largely continued to operate within the constraints of the
"One China" policy. Notwithstanding the officially supported one-China
policy, the U.S. has practiced its own version. The Taiwan Relations Act
of 1979 considered any non-peaceful means to influence Taiwan a threat
to the security of the Western Pacific and a U.S. concern. Section 3(a)
of the Act states that the U.S. will make available to Taiwan such
defense articles and services necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a
sufficient self-defense capability. Accordingly, [the protection of
Taiwan would remain at the discretion of the president and
Congress]{.underline}. This [de facto policy has remained in practice
with significant U.S. arms deals to Taiwan despite a lack of official
diplomatic relations]{.underline}. The sale of U.S. defense equipment to
Taiwan totaled \$4.3 billion from 2004-2007 and \$2.9 billion from
2008-2011. However the U.S. has hedged on the sale of submarines as an
arguably offensive weapon, barred within the restrictions of the Taiwan
Relations Act. The U.S. Navy has also remained largely opposed to the
trade of diesel submarines for reasons, both bureaucratic and
operational. In 2001 during the presidency of George W. Bush provided a
moment of hope for a change in policy. The [Bush]{.underline}
administration [initially agreed to]{.underline} a major arms sale to
Taiwan, [approving the sale of eight diesel submarines in a deal that
included a variety of anti-submarine and anti-ship defense
articles]{.underline}. The Pentagon called the deal a robust package,
warning of China's superiority in submarines and the difficulty Taiwan
would face in opposing a naval blockade with existing resources.
Obstacles materialized at once. Bush never resolved them. Caught between
the U.S. nuclear submarine industry's staunch opposition and the PRC's
bullying of prospective trading nations, Taiwan's defense needs went
unmet. Over a decade has passed and the Taiwanese navy's submersible
capabilities remain severely limited. Still in commission are the two
decommissioned Zwaardvis-class vessels built by the Dutch Navy in the
1980's. Taiwan's navy practices in two ex-U.S Guppy-class boats built at
the end of World War II. I've seen and been in these boats. They are
relics that need to be replaced. [Submarines have become the weak spot
of the robust and very capable Taiwan navy]{.underline}. The
**[Asia-Pacific theatre necessitates maritime strength]{.underline}**.
More to the point, Taiwan is an island. [Without modern vessels, Taiwan
is short of the means to defend itself]{.underline}. Taiwan has
accordingly increased its efforts to use its own resources to build
submarines. ROCN chief Admiral Chen Yeong-kang released the indigenous
plan Forces Structure and Planning Concepts for the Future ROCN in
January of 2014. This plan called for refurbishing the obsolete
Guppy-class submarine with new steel plates and pressure hulls and
extending their life as training vessels. This would help develop
domestic experience in submarine construction. It's a good idea. The
ROCN would invest 450 million dollars in China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC)
and the Ship and Ocean Industry R&D Center (SOIC) in the next two years
to help accomplish this plan. On August 31, the Ministry submitted an
\$89 million budgetary proposal for an indigenous submarine design. The
indigenous program includes a separate plan to extend the life of the
two Zwaardvis-class submarines with estimated budget of \$90 million.
Again, this adds skill and experience to the industrial base needed to
build submarines from the keel up. In November 2014, a seminar on the
indigenous defense submarines (IDS) program brought experts and
officials from the U.S., Germany, France, Sweden, Netherlands, Italy,
and Australia to Taiwan. Following the seminar, the IDS program sought
to develop submarines between 1,500 to 2,000 tons with the first boat to
be completed in 2024. In December, the Ministry of National Defense,
(MND), the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Science and
Technology, the China Shipbuilding Corporation (CSBC), and Ship and
Ocean Industry R & D Center (SOIC) met with the Legislative Yuan's
Foreign and Defense Affair Committee. In the hearing, Vice Admiral Kao
Tein-Chung revealed that the after a comprehensive evaluation the best
approach for the IDS program is to build the submarines in Taiwan with
the technical support of the U.S. Submarine design and production are
formidable challenges. For example compare an Australian-produced
3,600-ton frigate to the Australian indigenously designed Collins-class
submarine. The [submarine required almost triple the number of
suppliers, called for almost triple the time of construction, and needed
more than double the hours of assembly]{.underline}. Over 33,000
drawings and 5,000 work orders were produced before the Collins-class
submarine build process could even began. During construction the
Collins-class submarines faced a multitude of problems, from welding of
the hull, to excessive engine noise, to a faulty combat system, and a
propulsion system that was prone to failure. Even after completion, the
Australian Collins-class faced serious operational issues. In 2009, only
one submarine (out of six), HMAS Farncomb, was capable of sea duty. Ten
to fifteen years is a reasonable length of time to develop a new type of
submarine, with two thirds of that time spent on design. Without many
experienced professionals, [the design stage will be
prolonged]{.underline}. In a RAND analysis, with sufficient software and
facilities, an estimated 600 to 900 professional designers are required
to complete the design stage. [While Taiwan's shipbuilding industry has
successively produced exceptional frigates and tankers, its submarine
program starts from the ground up]{.underline}. Success depends on
Taiwan's ability to train or recruit designers. Many Taiwanese officials
have spoken of securing international assistance for developing an IDS
submarine. The United Sates has not constructed a diesel submarine since
the Barbel-class diesel-electric boat of the late 1950s. But the **[U.S.
could assist by providing design engineers; by supplying the plans for
the Barbel-class boat; by working together with Japanese shipbuilders
who make excellent submarines; and by relaxing export controls on items
needed to build subs, and integrating combat systems]{.underline}**.
[There are multiple U.S. defense contractors that have good working
relations with Taiwan]{.underline}. In 2002, when [the U.S. Navy
discussed options with Taiwan's navy, General Dynamics, Northrop
Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon all expressed interest in
becoming the prime contractor]{.underline}. These companies have long
experience in Taiwanese defensive abilities. Taiwan held an Aerospace &
Defense Technology Exhibition in August. In attendance were **[Lockheed
Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, and Rockwell
Collins]{.underline}**. Working with U.S. companies to design a
Taiwanese submarine could materially assist the program while giving
Taiwan control over production and manufacturing.

A [Chinese invasion of Taiwan is not inevitable]{.underline}. Beijing
has shown little interest in territorial conquest: since the founding of
the People's Republic, PRC troops have conquered territory in three
nations (North Korea, India, and Vietnam) that they subsequently
relinquished voluntarily. But [Taiwan is different, given its
historical, linguistic, and ethnic ties to China, **and its strategic
value**]{.underline}. And so [the risk of a Chinese invasion remains the
organizing challenge for Taiwan's military]{.underline}. [U.S. efforts
to provide Taiwan with weaponry have long hinged on a faulty strategy:
that Taiwan only needs to be strong enough to hold out before the United
States intervenes on its behalf]{.underline}. [As China's capabilities
grow, a scenario in which America fights a great power war over Taiwan
looks like an increasingly poor tradeoff]{.underline}. Taiwan can draw
important lessons from its main adversary on how to deal with a superior
challenger. In seeking to limit American power in the Western Pacific,
[China has built up anti-access/area denial capabilities that can
cost-effectively counter U.S. carrier battle groups and land-based
aircraft]{.underline}. [Advances in radar, sensor, and missile
technology have increased the advantage that defenders typically enjoy
in war]{.underline}. China's A2/AD network of radar, sensors, and
weapons (surface-to-air missiles, anti-ship missiles, etc.) can impose
prohibitive costs on the expensive U.S. assets that would operate near
its shores in a conflict. **[Taiwan should capitalize on these
technological trends and focus its military spending on building out its
own A2/AD capabilities to defend against invasion]{.underline}**. The
ROC currently spends \$10.5 billion annually on its military, a tiny
fraction of the PRC's \$239 billion. [China also maintains
a]{.underline} (vastly) [numerically superior and in many aspects
qualitatively superior military than Taiwan]{.underline}. [Aircraft or
warships deployed by Taiwan in a conflict would also be in range of
China's A2/AD defenses, further compounding the
disadvantage]{.underline}. The scarcity of Taiwanese defense dollars and
Taiwan's inability to match China one-for-one in ships and aircraft
makes it especially important to invest in weapons that maximize the
cost to an invader. [Tanks and TOW missiles do not provide that, but **a
robust A2/AD network would**]{.underline}. Taiwan should reduce
investment in long-range strike platforms and fighter aircraft (it has
asked for an assortment of cutting-edge U.S. fighters), and [instead
**grow its stockpile of anti-air and anti-ship missiles**]{.underline}.
[The Taiwanese can improve their air defenses by buying more MIM-104
Patriot batteries and accompanying missiles]{.underline}. [They should
also shift investments away from large surface vessels that can easily
be spotted and sunk, and instead **build out a fleet of rapid attack
boats and fast corvettes**]{.underline} (like the Tuo Jiang class)
equipped with anti-ship missiles. [To defend its radar and sensors, the
most vulnerable and most important part of an A2/AD network, Taiwan
should add more of them and harden the defenses around
them]{.underline}. It should also, as a 2017 report from RAND advised,
develop survivable high-altitude airborne sensors and distributed
ground-based sensors that can be continually moved in the event of war.
In addition to making these weapons available for sale, [Washington
should push Taiwan to shift away from flashy but limited value weapons,
and instead develop a native defensive capability that is both practical
and robust]{.underline}. While it might seem strange for the United
States to dictate a foreign nation's military acquisitions, [our current
policy commits American lives and assets to Taiwan's
defense]{.underline}. As long as that persists, **[it is the
responsibility of U.S. policymakers to ensure Taiwan provides the most
favorable operational environment possible]{.underline}**. For every
big-ticket weapons sale to Taiwan, the United States bears a political
cost with China. The [weapons transferred must therefore contribute to a
sound defensive strategy and deter]{.underline} rather than invite
[armed conflict]{.underline}. **[By empowering Taiwan to properly defend
itself, the U.S. can dodge the politically treacherous question of just
how far it is willing to go in Taiwan's defense, and incentivize China
to seek a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan question]{.underline}**.

Implications [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must
consider its Taiwan policy within a holistic framework of the potential
outcomes]{.underline}, not just on Taiwan and the PRC, but [on global
American interests as well]{.underline}. As tempting as it may be to
believe that removing "the Taiwan question" would dramatically improve
US-PRC relations, the [PRC's position as a rising power challenging the
status quo and its recent assertiveness regarding its territorial
claims, suggest [the PRC would]{.mark} not [view American
compromise]{.mark} on Taiwan [as a move made]{.mark} out of strength,
but rather **one made [out of weakness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Should
the United States continue to defer selling Taiwan weapons that provide
new capabilities, as during the past six years, it will not have an
immediate impact on Taiwan's defense. Instead, [lacking new
capabilities, Taiwan's military will continue its slow but steady
decline, especially considering the rapid and continuing improvement
made by PRC forces]{.underline}. Given these increasing military and
economic pressures, **[it is likely that]{.underline}** either Taiwan's
leaders would feel pressured to acquiesce to PRC political pressure or
**[[cross-Strait stability would suffer]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A
[decrease]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the perceived [willingness of the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to support Taiwan would reverberate
across the region to US allies and partners]{.mark}, likely [leading
them to question the substance and durability of US
commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially [[leading]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} decreased balancing]{.underline} against [and]{.underline}
increased [[attempts to bandwagon with the PRC]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[It would also severely impact American soft
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [seemingly confirming the narrative that
the United States is a power in retreat and the PRC is ascendant,
lending greater credence to Chinese efforts to affect the current
international order]{.underline}. Decreased American support for Taiwan
would likely bring forward the day when the PRC is able to bring Taiwan
under its control politically, economically, or militarily. Counter to
the intent of the United States' rebalance to Asia and the Pacific, [[it
would risk]{.mark} "[legitimizing PRC use of military coercion]{.mark}
to resolve political differences with its neighbors and **[sends a
signal to others in the region of a diminished US commitment in
Asia]{.mark}."**]{.underline}33 Were the PRC to control Taiwan, [it
would be able to project greater military power and influence in the
East and South China Seas and gain unfettered access to the western
Pacific]{.underline}. [PRC control of Taiwan would extend its control of
key industries, such as semiconductor design and manufacturing,
threatening American security]{.underline}. Perhaps most consequential,
it would silence the world's only Chinese democracy, thereby
extinguishing the most effective beacon for liberalism and pluralism for
the Chinese mainland. Multiple options exist to attenuate or delay these
impacts. Most important, while still desiring to engage the PRC as a
competitor rather than as an adversary, [the United States should shift
its China policy from one of aspiration to one grounded in a more
transactional style]{.underline}. Instead of appealing to the PRC to
change its behavior, often against Beijing's own interests, the United
States should employ a quid-pro-quo-based approach to more effectively
influence China to become a responsible regional and global stakeholder.
[Another key step would be to develop a clear and coordinated US policy
on Taiwan that incorporates the views of both the executive and
legislative branches, as is mandated by the TRA]{.underline}. Such a
policy would better enable the United States to resist PRC pressure and
decrease fluctuations in policy between parties and with changes in
presidential administrations. A [reinvigorated US security assistance
policy for Taiwan must begin]{.underline} by making greater demands of
the Taiwanese themselves. In exchange for continuing security
assistance, American policy should require Taiwan's commitment to
increased defense spending as a percentage of GDP, currently 1.9
percent, placing it closer to levels budgeted by other nations facing
existential threats such as Israel, 5.7 percent, South Korea, 2.8
percent, and Singapore, 3.5 percent.34 Shortly after taking office on 4
August 2008, President Ma promised Taiwan would "demonstrate \[its\]
determination to defend \[itself\] by\...raising \[its\] defense budget
to three percent of GDP."35 Taiwan cannot expect even ambiguous American
security guarantees if it is not willing to more seriously provide for
its own defense. Next, [the United States should assist Taiwan in
diversifying its economy to lessen its current reliance on trade with
the PRC]{.underline}. A large step in this direction would be offering
Taiwan membership in the Trans-Pacific Partnership if it proves willing
to undertake the politically painful economic changes necessary for
admission. Finally, [the United States should continue to make clear
that any unilateral changes to the status quo by Taiwan would preclude
American military assistance]{.underline}. **[[If Taiwan's political
leaders remain sufficiently confident of ongoing US support, they will
be more likely to "forego any radical solutions for maintaining Taiwan's
sovereignty and national security
status."]{.underline}]{.mark}**36Several simple American administrative
changes would increase the effectiveness of the security assistance
provided to Taiwan and decrease adverse PRC reactions. The [United
States should reinstate the annual Taiwan Arms Talks cancelled by
President Bush in 2001]{.underline}. Taiwan is not a normal FMS
customer. An annual meeting would ensure that Taiwan's security
assistance requests receive due consideration and would provide an
additional forum for discussions between Taiwanese and American defense
leaders. Next, the United States should rescind its 2008 process change
of delaying and bundling arms sales notifications according to the
"China calendar." More frequent individual program notifications would
be less likely than the current process to arouse PRC ire and would
condition the PRC to expect routine and ongoing American assistance to
Taiwan. Additionally, [individual sales would provide a variable
response that the United States could ratchet up or down based upon PRC
actions in the South and East China Seas or increased threats to
Taiwan]{.underline}. Furthermore, this change would improve Taiwan's
ability to plan for itself, providing it a greater sense of control of
its own defense, decreasing Taiwan's dependence on American security
guarantees. **[[Another part of a renewed US strategy should be to
encourage greater Direct Commercial Sales to Taiwan and the
authorization of]{.mark} increased [technology transfers to allow Taiwan
to indigenously construct advanced weapon systems like
submarines]{.mark}]{.underline}**. After 1983, "US policymakers paid
close attention to FMS-case values, instead stressing direct commercial
sales (DCS) for arms to Taiwan. Examples of major DCS programs, or
hybrid FMS/DCS programs, during this period include the CM-11/M48H main
battle tank, the Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF), the PFG-2 frigate
program, and the Tien Kong air defense system, among others. [Because of
the smaller public footprint of direct commercial sales, negative PRC
responses to these types of US-Taiwan technical transfer]{.underline}
\[sic\], licensed production, or locally assembled within DCS channels
[appear both subdued and rare]{.underline}."37Furthermore, the United
States should reconsider the requirement to make congressional
notifications of security assistance public. Originally passed to ensure
arms sales to Taiwan received sufficient congressional debate, "these
[little-noticed provisions have dramatically altered the climate
affecting arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}. What was once an obscure
process is now increasingly open to congressional and public debate."38
[Removing this public reminder of Taiwan's self-governance and potential
irritant to the PRC from the arms transfer process might assist in
reducing the strength of PRC protests]{.underline}. The United States
should also work to redefine PRC views of American security assistance
to Taiwan. Recognizing PRC attempts to draw red lines around new
technologies and key systems, [the United States should work to recast
the bounds of the conversation]{.underline}. For missile defense, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [could]{.mark} begin [discuss]{.mark}ions
on selling [THAAD systems and]{.mark} settle for further [Patriot
deliveries]{.mark}]{.underline}, if Taiwan has a military requirement
for the system. **[[Air superiority discussions should shift to the sale
of F-35s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such that Beijing would no longer view
the sale of F-16C/Ds as the worst-case option. Following this pattern,
[[Taiwan could still receive critical]{.mark}, if not the most [modern,
systems for key defense missions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Next, [the United
States should publicly link weapon sales to Taiwan with PRC behavior in
the East and South China Seas and especially to threats to Taiwan's
security]{.underline}. The United States should tie a future South China
Sea ADIZ declaration, for example, to the release of an advanced
capability to Taiwan, such as F-16C/D aircraft. The United States should
meet PRC systems or actions that threaten Taiwan with the sale of a
system that helps to counter that threat. In this way, [the PRC would
understand that "continued reliance on military instruments of coercion
to resolve political differences]{.underline} \[[would]{.underline}\]
[come at a cost]{.underline}. Sound US-China relations rest upon the
assumption that Beijing will adopt peaceful means to resolve differences
with Taiwan."39

### Steady-Stream mechanism

#### The United States federal government should substantially increase its arms sales to Taiwan through privately negotiated multi-year deals to be conducted and announced in increments of less than \$1 billion per sale.

#### Solves -- a moderated increase is key to stability in the strait.

On the Kinmen Island only a few miles east of mainland China, Taiwan
deploys anti-ship missiles, surface-to-surface missiles, monitoring
radar and remote howitzers. Among these arms directly pointing at China,
the most advanced ones are from the United States. [Every round of
U.S.]{.underline} eye-catching and pricy [arms package sales to Taiwan
**irritates China**]{.underline}. These sales of advanced armaments lead
to intense condemnation of Washington and sanctions against U.S.
companies. However, [by **changing** current arms package sales to the
approach of a **steady stream** of **small deals**]{.underline}, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can **relieve tensions** with
China and **better fulfill** its security commitment to
Taiwan]{.underline}. The U.S. has sold arms to Taiwan since establishing
diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. These [arms
sales help the U.S. to fulfill the **security commitment**]{.underline}
[to the island based on the]{.underline} 1979 Taiwan Relations Act
(**[TRA]{.underline}**). However, [with the current
approach]{.underline}, [the U.S. is **failing** to help Taiwan to deter
China]{.underline}, [and also **risks** U.S.-Taiwan-China trilateral
relations]{.underline}. [Instead]{.underline}, [the U.S. can sell **more
arms**]{.underline}, especially those for defensive purposes, [to Taiwan
in a steady stream of small increments]{.underline}. [The U.S. should
**announce** and **deliver** arms packages **separately**]{.underline},
[bringing the price tag for each sale below **\$1
billion**]{.underline}. [The advantages of this approach are
significant]{.underline}: **[Bolster U.S. credibility]{.underline}**.
[China's]{.underline} severe [complaints]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} U.S. [arms sales raise insecurity and doubts not
only in Taiwan]{.underline}, [but also with other U.S. allies in the
region]{.underline}: **[South Korea]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Japan]{.underline}**. [With the suggested
approach]{.underline}---[selling **more arms**]{.underline}, but [below

[can uphold]{.underline} its security commitments as well as
[international obligations]{.underline}. [It will **significantly
enhance**]{.underline} U.S. [credibility in the region]{.underline},
especially among U.S. allies. **[Stabilize]{.underline}**
[U.S.-Taiwan-China trilateral relations]{.underline}. [Smaller arms
deals]{.underline} between the U.S. and Taiwan [are much less likely to
irritate China]{.underline}. [China will find it difficult to
impose]{.underline} severe [sanctions because of an arms deal only worth
millions of dollars]{.underline}. The U.S. has been balancing between
China and Taiwan since 1979, and has successfully avoided significant
conflict across the strait. Peace has provided the environment for the
growth of Taiwan's democracy, as well as the vast increase of trade
between the U.S. and China. [This policy will help the U.S. to maintain
the status quo]{.underline}. [Secure Taiwan and its
**democracy**]{.underline}. [The **increased** number of arms
sold]{.underline} [will equip Taiwan with better capability to **deter
China**]{.underline}. If China were to conduct an attack, [Taiwan would
be able to **resist longer** before the U.S. came to
rescue]{.underline}. [Facing]{.underline} the rapid rise of Chinese
military power and the prospect of [decreased]{.underline} U.S. [arms
sales]{.underline}, [Taiwan has become **more**]{.underline} and more
[vulnerable]{.underline} against China. [This policy will help to secure
Taiwan and its democracy]{.underline}. How can the U.S. implement this
policy effectively? [The U.S. can reach a **private agreement** on
larger multi-year deals with Taiwan]{.underline}, in order to keep arms
production lines open. [However]{.underline}, **[public
announcements]{.underline}** of arms agreements [should be small and
incremental]{.underline}. Like past arms deals, the arms sales under
this policy can be operated by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
in the Department of Defense. Even though there is a chance that China
may find out about the private agreement, [it will be hard for China to
create a pretext for war building on **rumors**]{.underline}. [The U.S.
has been keeping]{.underline} "[a]{.underline} robust unofficial
[relationship]{.underline}" [with Taiwan for decades]{.underline}. [This
relationship has]{.underline} assisted the "Taiwan Economic Miracle" in
the 1980s, [promoted Taiwan's democratization]{.underline} in the 1990s,
[and secured the well-being]{.underline} and confidence [of Taiwanese
people]{.underline} in the 21st century. U.S. support underpins Taiwan's
sovereignty and democracy, and [arms sales are the **central element**

this increased yet less risky arms sale approach to Taiwan, the U.S.

Barely a month before elections likely to bring the independence-minded
opposition to power, the [Obama]{.underline} administration has
[announced a nearly \$2 billion arms package for Taiwan]{.underline}.
The prospect of the first weapons deal since 2011 elicited the standard
protest from Beijing about interfering in its "internal affairs" and
impairing its "sovereignty and security." China threatened to retaliate
with sanctions against U.S. firms. Nevertheless, [the sale should help
preserve peace in the region]{.underline}. [The weapons are of only
modest value, but affirm America's commitment]{.underline} through the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 to help Taipei defend itself. Desire for a
better relationship with the People's Republic of China has led some
analysts to advocate ending the controversial sales, but [the PRC's
recent aggressiveness in the East and South China Seas reinforces the
case for continuing arms transfers]{.underline}. The announcement also
suggests Washington's acceptance, if not endorsement, of the Democratic
Progressive Party's Tsai Ing-wen, who is almost certain to win the
presidency. The DPP also may win the legislative Yuan for the first
time. In the past the United States not so subtly favored the
Kuomintang, going back to Chiang Kai-shek. The tempestuous presidency of
Chen Sui-bian during the 2000s cemented that preference. Now Washington
has indicated its willingness to arm a Tsai government. Although she has
adopted a moderate tone toward the PRC, that likely reflects realpolitik
rather than conviction. She almost certainly would prefer to lead Taiwan
to independence. This appears to be the PRC's interpretation of the
deal. Xinhua News Agency declared that the sale "will set back the
positive momentum as it serves the interests of those seeking Taiwan's
independence." However, this "positive momentum" exists only to the
extent that last month's meeting between Xi Jinping and Ma Ying-jeou,
presidents of the PRC and the Republic of China respectively, represents
continuing Chinese forbearance. Their session failed to bridge the
widening gulf between the authoritarian mainland colossus and democratic
island republic, which have been separated for decades. The Taiwanese
have created an independent nation, though it is officially recognized
by just a score or so countries. The island was forfeited by China after
the latter's defeat by Japan in 1895. China's KMT government gained
control after Tokyo's defeat in 1945. With the Communist Party victory
in 1949 the KMT retreated to the island. The outbreak of the Korean War
led the United States to shield Taiwan from Beijing's forces, allowing
development of two Chinas, both claiming sovereignty over the other.
Washington's eventual opening to Mao's PRC reshuffled the geopolitical
deck, leading to U.S. acceptance of one China, namely Beijing, with an
ambiguous commitment to Taiwan's (not the ROC's) separate existence.
Washington wouldn't say that it would defend Taipei should the PRC act
on its many threats. However, the United States committed to sell
defensive weapons to Taiwan. Of which the new package is the latest
iteration. By any standard of justice, the Taiwanese are entitled to
independence. China's long-ago sovereignty does not trump the desire of
the twenty-three million people who have dramatically transformed their
society. An increasing percentage identify as Taiwanese, with little
interest in the PRC. Why, indeed, would any Taiwanese want to be ruled
by Beijing? However, China is committed to resisting any attempt at
separation/secession. Formal independence likely would come only in
battle, and require outside assistance, as did America's struggle
against Great Britain. [While the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [was willing to tip the cross-strait balance during
the Cold War, that world disappeared long ago]{.underline}. Taiwan
simply doesn't matter much for U.S. security. The island could act as an
offensive asset for use against the PRC, serving as a military base in
what otherwise would be Chinese waters. However, [Washington should
avoid such a conflict, and that prospect only increases Beijing's
opposition to Taiwanese independence.]{.underline} The cultural and
economic ties between the United States and Taiwan are important, but
limited. The bilateral diplomatic-political connection was effectively
severed with Washington's recognition of the PRC. **[America is ever
less likely to intervene on Taiwan's behalf.]{.underline}** [Indeed, the
U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity has become more dangerous as China's
power has increased]{.underline}. Taiwan matters much more to the PRC
than America. Thus, as a Chinese general not so subtly argued, [the
United States won't risk Los Angeles for Taipei.]{.underline} Indeed, it
would be madness for America to do so. It might seem equally foolish for
China to risk, say, Shanghai to regain Taiwan. But it is far more
plausible that the PRC might do so. **[Enabling Taiwan to defend itself
is the best way out of this conundrum]{.underline}**. So long as [the
residents of Zhongnanhai value prosperity and stability, they have
reason to avoid costly conflict.]{.underline} [No arms sales would
enable Taipei to defeat a determined PRC in war]{.underline}. **[The
former's objective, however, should be deterrence, not
victory]{.underline}**. "[The idea is to complicate China's
scenarios]{.underline}, to make them pause, to get them to think twice
before they attack," explained Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the
U.S.-Taiwan Business Council. **[The higher the price any PRC government
would pay for attempting to coerce Taipei, the less likely it would try
to do so]{.underline}**. Continued patience would remain good sense.
**[That doesn't mean there won't be costs to the U.S.-China relationship
as a result, but they are worth bearing]{.underline}**. [There's likely
diplomatic turbulence]{.underline}. In [the past military meetings have
been suspended, though only temporarily. There could be economic
retaliation, though the threat seems overblown: defense companies are
barred from supplying the PRC and sanctions against civilian sales would
hurt the PRC as well]{.underline}. Taipei will face a continuing
difficult challenge in maintaining its independent international
existence. **[Washington should establish a more routine weapons
transfer process]{.underline}**. [Doing so would offer a form of
strategic certainty short of war which would better protect Taiwanese
security and advance American interests]{.underline}.

//ghs-ef)**

The [Obama]{.underline} administration on Wednesday [announced a sale of
arms to Taiwan,]{.underline} the first since 2010. While it will once
again anger the People\'s Republic of China, [it\'s an important step in
giving the island democracy the tools it needs to preserve
independence]{.underline}, at least until a political solution
acceptable to both sides is realized. In the wake of the Chinese Civil
War, two countries competed for the right to call themselves China: the
victorious communist People\'s Republic of China on the mainland and the
losing Republic of China, which retreated to the island of Taiwan. The
United States formally recognized the People\'s Republic in 1979, but at
the same time acknowledged a responsibility to help democratic Taiwan
defend itself. Only a strait of 110 miles separates Taiwan from the
mainland, less than the distance from Washington D.C. to Philadelphia.
Known to mariners as "The Black Ditch," for decades the strait has kept
Taiwan safe. [In the past Taiwan might as well have been on the far side
of the moon, as China did not have the air and naval forces necessary to
invade the island. That is changing, and lately the island nation\'s
ability to defend itself is increasingly in doubt]{.underline}. Double
digit increases in the mainland\'s defense budget have funded a broad
[modernization of China\'s]{.underline} air, land, and sea
[forces]{.underline}. This h[as eroded Taiwan\'s military edge ---
particularly around the island itself]{.underline}. Beijing\'s recent
purchase of S-400 long-range air defense missiles from Russia means even
aircraft flying over Taiwan could be shot down from the mainland. The
military analysis of the Taiwan standoff is roughly this: [While China
could not conduct a successful invasion now, in 10 years, an air and sea
blockade would be successful. In 20 years, invasion will be
possible]{.underline}. [The arms sale to Taiwan is modest]{.underline},
worth about \$1.83 billion compared to a \$5.8 billion sale in 2010. It
will include two anti-submarine frigates, Stinger surface to air
missiles, and Javelin and TOW anti-tank missiles. These are completely
defensive weapons that could not threaten China and Chinese military
forces --- unless those forces crossed the strait and landed on the
island. While those weapons will no doubt be useful**[, the actual need
is considerably greater]{.underline}**. **[Taiwan needs submarines
capable of threatening an invasion fleet and fighters to stand up to
Beijing\'s newest fifth generation designs]{.underline}**. **[Taiwan
doesn\'t need to match China\'s military ship for ship and plane for
plane, it just needs something large enough to install sufficient doubt
in the mind of Chinese policymakers]{.underline}**. [The stronger
Beijing has grown politically and economically, the more reluctant the
United States has been in selling arms to Taiwan]{.underline}. Beijing
regards Washington\'s support for Taiwan as meddling in an internal
matter, as though China sold arms to a Hawaii that had broken away from
the rest of the United States. To an extent, China is right. From a
broad perspective, it is a Chinese matter. But it\'s also a matter where
freedom, democracy, and human rights are at stake, all of which are
enjoyed in Taiwan, but not the People\'s Republic. The United States has
a moral obligation to assist any nation guaranteeing those principles to
its people. [Each time we sell arms to Taiwan, Beijing
retaliates]{.underline} --- in 2010, it cut off military-to-military
exchanges between China and the U.S. for months. It\'s a Catch-22 --- on
one hand, the United States can\'t abandon Taiwan, but on the other
hand, our relationship with China has to be carefully maintained.
[Still, if Washington has to err on one particular side, better to err
on the side consistent with our principles]{.underline}. [China and
Taiwan may very well some day peacefully work out their differences and
merge into a single state. But until then, the United States needs to
resist political pressure from China and give the island country the
means to negotiate not from a position of insecurity, but from a
position of strength]{.underline}.

#### Subs solve 

**Cheng 15**

**(Dean, Senior Research Fellow in the Asian Studies Center, of the
Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and
Foreign Policy, "Why Taiwan Needs Submarines," pg online @**

In 2001, President George W. [Bush's]{.underline} Administration [agreed
to a major arms sale to Taiwan]{.underline}. [Approved for sale to
Taipei were anti-submarine warfare aircraft, anti-ship missiles,
self-propelled howitzers, minesweepers, and destroyers]{.underline}.
[The United States also agreed to help Taiwan obtain new diesel-electric
submarines, to modernize the island's underwater forces]{.underline}. At
the time, the Republic of China Navy (ROCN) had two ex-Dutch
Zwaardvis-class boats, built in the 1980s, and two ex-U.S. Navy
Guppy-class boats built at the end of World War II. [Thirteen years
later, Taiwan's submarine arm still consists of two ex-Dutch submarines
and two boats most of whose peers are now museum exhibits.]{.underline}
[Years of on-again, off-again discussions have not resulted in an actual
sale from the United States]{.underline} or any other nation. More
seriously, there has also been no movement in facilitating American
shipwrights' and experts' engagement with their Taiwanese counterparts
to allow Taiwan to build its own boats. Taiwan's Maritime Security
Situation An island nation, Taiwan is one of the most densely populated
territories on earth, with over 630 persons per square kilometer. The 23
million people on the island are almost wholly dependent on imports for
both food and energy. Equally important, [Taiwan's security depends on
the ability to challenge the ability of the Chinese]{.underline}
People's Liberation Army ([PLA) to cross the islands and mount an
invasion, or impose a blockade that would leave the residents starving
and in the dark]{.underline}. The PLA's main planning guidelines appear
to focus, still, on taking Taiwan. The PLA's best forces, and much of
its strategic and operational thinking, appear to be oriented toward
either taking Taiwan or countering any American attempt to prevent such
Chinese actions. [Because of the disparity in physical size, economy,
and geography, Taiwan's maritime security in the face of the Chinese
threat is a challenging problem]{.underline}. China has the wherewithal
to simultaneously bombard Taiwan (especially with its large arsenal of
short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles), while also being able
to deploy forces farther afield of Taiwan's immediate environment. For
Taipei, the key to a successful defense of the island is to hold out
long enough for the United States to intervene decisively. Taiwan's
military must therefore be able to simultaneously defend the island,
while also nonetheless being able to deny the Chinese regime the ability
to easily or rapidly isolate the island. **[Submarines have long played
a role in Taiwan's defense calculations]{.underline}**. [Given the
relative weakness of China's anti-submarine warfare capabilities,
submarines would pose a significant threat to any amphibious
force]{.underline}. Indeed, the record of the British Royal Navy during
the Falklands would suggest a disproportionate effect from even a
handful of modern submarines. On the one hand, the sinking of the
Argentine cruiser General Belgrano led the Argentines to withdraw all
naval forces from the British-declared exclusion zone. At the same time,
however, even though the Royal Navy was considered the premier
anti-submarine force in NATO, it failed to find the Argentine sub ARA
San Luis.\[1\] That boat managed to remain at sea for over a month, and
despite the best efforts of NATO's premier anti-submarine force, was
apparently able to operate relatively unhindered. The Royal Navy
expended substantial amounts of ordnance against a variety of false
contacts, depleting its stocks for no real effect.\[2\] Indeed, but for
problems with its fire control system, that Argentine sub might well
have changed the course of the battle, as it repeatedly achieved firing
solutions on elements of the British task force.\[3\] In light of the
importance of submarines, and given Taiwan's aging fleet, the U.S. in
April 2001 committed to helping Taiwan acquire up to eight
diesel-electric submarines. This commitment was complicated by the
reality that the United States has not built diesel-electric submarines
since the 1950s, as the U.S. Navy transitioned to an all-nuclear power
submarine force. As the U.S. has no intention of transferring
nuclear-powered subs to Taiwan, the United States was, in effect,
promising to help Taiwan acquire such systems from third parties. But
the European shipbuilders who were expected to provide the designs and
the hulls were subjected to intense pressure from Beijing not to supply
Taiwan with such systems. At the same time, major political clashes
between the Democratic Progress Party's President Chen Shui-bian and the
Kuomintang-controlled legislature raised issues about funding and
Taiwan's commitment to acquiring the submarines. Consequently, the
United States has had to rethink its approach. In 2006, Richard Lawless,
then the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Asian & Pacific Security
Affairs, indicated that the United States was open to a two-phase
approach to explore the possibility of indigenous production of
diesel-electric submarines by Taiwan. The first phase would involve
determining a design for these boats, while the second would involve
actual construction and subsequent operations and maintenance. A formal
congressional notification for the first phase was prepared in early
2008, but it has remained in the State Department with no movement in
the subsequent six years. Increasingly frustrated by the lack of
American action, and with no prospect of sales by any European
manufacturers, Taiwan began its own two-pronged approach: In 2011,
Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou formally requested that the Obama
Administration approve the first phase for submarine production, which
would allow American corporations to enter into discussions with their
Taiwanese counterparts over design and source selection. When the
submarine program was nonetheless not included in the September 2011
arms sales notification to Congress, Taiwan began to explore the
possibility of completely indigenous design and manufacturing. Bringing
together elements from Taiwan's military, major shipbuilders, and key
design centers, a Taiwanese task force produced a submarine program
feasibility study.\[4\] This led to a plan, forwarded to the Taiwan
legislature in October 2014, whereby Taiwan's own Ship and Ocean
Industries Research and Development Center would design the vessels,
China Shipbuilding Corporation would manufacture the boats, and the
Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology would provide the key
weapons and sensors. Unfortunately, such a program would cost some \$4.9
billion for the first four vessels. This would consume a significant
portion of Taiwan's overall defense budget.\[5\] Nor would this address
the reality that Taiwan's shipbuilders have no experience building a
submarine, which entails working with specialized steel and integrating
a variety of sensors and weapons in ways very different from surface
combatants. Yet, given the lack of progress on the American side in
fulfilling its prior commitment, and the unwillingness of European
nations to risk antagonizing Beijing, it is understandable why Taiwan
would choose this option since it has no other real choices. U.S. Policy
[It is in U.S. security interests to ensure that Taiwan maintains a
sufficiently robust defense that it can deter Chinese aggression,
especially as China has become increasingly assertive throughout the
East Asian littoral in recent years]{.underline}. [The relatively quiet
state of the Taiwan Straits may well change after the 2016]{.underline}
Taiwan [presidential elections]{.underline}, particularly given likely
Chinese reaction to a Democratic Progressive Party victory. Recent
Chinese actions toward Hong Kong have probably torpedoed any prospect of
the "one country, two systems" approach that Beijing has long proffered
to Taiwan. The United States should: Allow the "Conception Definition
and Design Source Selection" phase to proceed promptly. Congress should
direct the Department of State to either allow this to move forward, or
provide a formal explanation on why it is failing to do so. Allow
American shipbuilders and weapons manufacturers to cooperate with
Taiwanese corporations in assessing Taiwan's capabilities and forward
bids on relevant sensors and weapons systems. At the same time, the U.S.
should also allow the sale of additional submarine weapons (e.g.,
submarine-launched Harpoon missiles) that are already in the Taiwanese
inventory. Continue to encourage other manufacturers of conventional
(diesel-electric) submarines to cooperate with Taiwan. The prospect of
Japan engaging in arms sales, and specifically the export of submarines
to Australia, raises the possibility of additional, non-traditional
suppliers who might be additional sources of either submarine
technology, or even completed boats. [Taiwan's defense would be
strengthened with more modern submarines. The U.S., as Taiwan's best,
and often only, friend, should help Taipei acquire an underwater force,
which would benefit not only Taiwan, but America's defense posture in
the western Pacific]{.underline}. To this end, the United States should
provide options that enable Taiwan to meet its requirements in the most
cost-effective way possible[. Because leaving Taiwan with a
single---extremely costly---option for fulfilling its defense needs puts
Taiwan's democracy and defense in a very precarious
position]{.underline}.

Plan Taiwan Needs to Defend against China, National Interest,

msm)

After eight years of relative calm in the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan turned a
page in its history on May 20, when Tsai Ing-wen of the Taiwan-centric
Democratic Progressive Party was sworn in as president. While it may be
premature to argue that the cross-Strait relationship has now entered a
new, and possibly more conflict-prone, era under Tsai, we must
nevertheless keep in mind that the military option to impose unification
was never obviated by Beijing, and that as its power grows that option
may look increasingly inevitable. Therefore, as the [Tsai
administration]{.underline} performs the onerous act of balancing
between stability in the Taiwan Strait and meeting the expectations of
its China-wary citizens, it [must]{.underline} [continue to prepare
against]{.underline} the [eventuality]{.underline} that **[China could
resort to force]{.underline}** of arms to break the status quo. Although
not exhaustive, the following discussion looks at a number of areas that
will be key to Taiwan's ability to defend itself against external
aggression in the coming years. This article, moreover, takes it for
granted that **[Taiwan has experienced and internalized a doctrinal
transformation]{.underline}** [whereby victory]{.underline} in the
military sense [no longer implies]{.underline} the defeat, if not
[annihilation, of its opponent]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} rather
[focuses]{.underline} primarily [on]{.underline} countering limiting
scenarios while **[strengthening its deterrent capability]{.underline}**
against more escalatory measures by its opponent. In other words,
[Taiwan]{.underline} realizes it could not possibly challenge the
People's Liberation Army symmetrically and expect to emerge victorious;
instead, the main aim of it[s]{.underline} national [defense
strategy]{.underline} is---or [should be]{.underline}---**[to ensure
that Beijing does not resort to force in the first place]{.underline}**.
[To do so]{.underline}, **[it will have to bolster its capabilities and
preparedness]{.underline}** in the following areas. **[Air
Defense]{.underline}** A [layered air-defense architecture acts
as]{.underline} the [first line against kinetic action by the
PLA]{.underline}. [At present]{.underline}, the [Taiwanese
military]{.underline} arguably [has]{.underline} the [necessary means to
protect key civilian and military infrastructure against]{.underline} a
[limited missile strike by]{.underline} the Second Artillery Corps, the
branch of the military that controls [China]{.underline}'s ballistic
missile force, both conventional and nuclear. While Taiwan does not
have---and likely never will acquire---the wherewithal to defend itself
against a major, multi-vectorial and sustained missile strike against a
vast array of facilities, the purpose of its air defense system is in
reality far more realistic: it is primarily aimed at taking the option
of coercive military strikes or leadership decapitation off the table.
Its current fixed SAM arsenal of ten U.S.-made Patriot batteries (forty
launchers) and ten domestically produced Tien Kung "Sky Bow" III
batteries (sixty launchers) are at the forefront of such efforts, with
deployments near major urban centers and other key facilities in the
north and south of Taiwan. According to analysts, one Patriot unit is
capable of intercepting twenty-four targets at a time with a success
rate of 90 percent. Those capabilities are augmented by fixed SAM PAC-2
and TK-I/IIs, as well as sea-based Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) air defense
systems, with short-range systems deployed at various military bases as
a final layer of defense. There is no doubt that [China could
attempt]{.underline} a "[knockout punch" against Taiwan's SAMs by
overwhelming its air defense sites and using longer-range ballistic
missiles]{.underline} than the SRBMs that the Patriot was designed to
counter (e.g., DF-15, 16 and 21). However, [such saturation
attacks]{.underline}---between five and fifteen missiles per Patriot
radar, for example---[would constitute a major escalation on China's
part]{.underline}, as would a simultaneous or sequential air attack by
the PLA Air Force (PLAAF), which would likely result in large amounts of
collateral and international opprobrium. It should also be noted that
the number of SRBMs needed to successfully overwhelm Taiwan's air
defense is contingent on the circular error probable (CEP) of the
missiles involved. According to a recent report by the RAND Corporation,
a total of forty-one ballistic missiles with a CEP of five meters would
be needed to disable Taiwan's air bases; that number would rise to 105
at a CEP of twenty-five meters and 155 at a CEP of forty meters. Besides
the escalatory nature of such a massive missile strike, [China has yet
to demonstrate is ability to conduct simultaneous launches on such a
scale]{.underline}. [For]{.underline} the [incoming
administration]{.underline}, the [best strategy will be to]{.underline}
**[improve upon the redundancy and survivability of SAM radar and
launcher sites on Taiwan proper and offshore]{.underline}** (outlying
islands), **[hardening targets]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[building up non-ground-fixed SAM capability]{.underline}** (e.g.,
sea-based SM-3), so as to force even greater escalation should China
attempt to knock out Taiwan's air defenses, C4ISR sites, government
buildings and key infrastructure, as well as naval and air bases. The
[key is]{.underline}n't to successfully defend against the entirety of
the Second Artillery Corps' 1,000--1,200 SRBMs, hundreds of MRBMs and
PLA cruise missiles and PLAAF capabilities, but rather [to]{.underline}
**[close the door on the option of limited strikes]{.underline}** with
the assumption that the need for escalation creates its own deterrent.
**[Closer]{.underline}** intelligence **[cooperation with
U.S]{.underline}**. and Japanese **[assets]{.underline}** in the region
**[will]{.underline}** also **[be crucial to increase situational
awareness and preparedness]{.underline}**. The **[United States
could]{.underline}** also **[contribute to Taiwan's air defenses by
agreeing to sell it]{.underline}** Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense
(**[THAAD]{.underline}**) **[systems]{.underline}**, which were recently
deployed in South Korea. **[Sea Denial]{.underline}** Should relations
between Taiwan and China deteriorate such that Beijing feels compelled
to invade Taiwan (for example, Taiwan declares de jure independence,
which President Tsai has vowed she will not entertain), an [amphibious
assault would be]{.underline} the [most feasible option for
China]{.underline}, as this alone would provide the "lift" necessary to
transport personnel and equipment across the Taiwan Strait. Although an
airlift following the PLAAF's securing control of the air corridor in
the Taiwan Strait is possible on paper, the amount of cargo aircraft
that would be needed to accomplish such a mission will remain beyond
China's capability for the foreseeable future. Thus, given the lack of
land access to Taiwan, the PLA's only option would be amphibious.
[Consequently]{.underline}, [Taiwan should continue to invest in land-,
sea- and air-based antiship/area denial and counter-landing
capabilities, with greater emphasis on dispersibility]{.underline}. This
can be accomplished by outfitting small attack, low-radar-signature
vessels with antiship missiles (e.g., Hsiung Feng-2/3) as well as
increasing the number of road-mobile HF-3 launchers across Taiwan proper
as well as on outlying islands. Coupled with the deployment of
ground-based one-to-two-hundred-kilometer ASM capability in Japan
(Okinawa and Ryukyu islands) and/or in the Philippines, land-based
antiship missiles in Taiwan and on its outlying islands would, as the
RAND Corporation stipulates in a recent report, "effectively deny all
naval traffic south of Okinawa" and "significantly limit" all naval
traffic in the Luzon Strait. The **[Tsai administration should explore
such options with the United States]{.underline}**, Japan and the
Philippines, while making sure that such an architecture would only be
activated in case of major escalation or outright aggression by the PLA.
[The area-denial strategy should also be accompanied by efforts to
augment observation, surveillance and tracking capability via radar,
unmanned aerial and sea-based vehicles as well as low-orbit sensors and
intelligence sharing. **Submarine Program**]{.underline} A [key
component of Taiwan's ability to deter]{.underline} an amphibious
assault or [naval blockade by China will be]{.underline} its [submarine
capability]{.underline}. [After years of]{.underline} stasis and the
**[refusal of the United States to sell it advanced diesel-electric
submarines]{.underline}**, which the United States no longer produces,
[Taiwan has finally decided to embark on an Indigenous Defense
Submarine]{.underline} (IDS) [program]{.underline}. Since Taiwan has no
experience designing or building submarines, it will perforce need
assistance from abroad. Progress has been made in this respect since
2013, and sometime last year the United States is believed to have given
the "green light" for efforts to proceed, with U.S. defense firms given
permission to play a role---especially for fire control and onboard
weapon systems. With an estimated cost of US\$3 billion per boat, the
IDS program will be the most ambitious defense endeavor in Taiwan's
recent history. Consequently, [it will be essential that every phase of
the project is handled properly and that the tasks are assigned to the
most suitable contractors]{.underline}. Industry sources indicate that
success for the program would in part be contingent on leadership at the
Ministry of National Defense, preferably by appointing someone from the
navy to head the MND. The Tsai administration instead appointed the
seventy-one-year-old Feng Shih-kuan, a former Air Force officer and
chairman of Aerospace Industrial Development Corp (AIDC) from 2006--08.

#### Selling Taiwan critical defense articles makes a potential Chinese attack cost-prohibitive -- solves the Aff and avoids the net benefit

Be In The U.S. Arms Sale To Taiwan", 12/9/15,

A recent article in Bloomberg indicates that the Obama Administration
will soon announce the first U.S. arms sale to Taiwan since 2011. The
four-year gap since the last round of sales is the longest period of
time without an arms deal since the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA)
defined the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. When the United States established
diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, it severed
official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which it had previously recognized
as the government of China. [Congress passed the TRA to]{.underline}
facilitate continued non-diplomatic relations between America and Taiwan
[and help maintain peace and security in the region]{.underline}. [One
important aspect of the TRA is that it requires the United States to
"make available to Taiwan such defense articles and]{.underline} defense
[services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to
maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.]{.underline}" Since 1979,
every president has announced multiple arms sales to Taiwan. The Obama
Administration has sold \$12 billion worth of military equipment to
Taiwan, but the four-year break led to bipartisan pressure from Congress
to announce another round of sales. The reported \$1 billion in new arms
sales to Taiwan would relieve congressional pressure but would also be
likely to increase tension in the U.S.-China relationship. The Chinese
government, which opposes the sale of military equipment to Taiwan,
usually responds negatively to arms deal announcements[.
China]{.underline} often cancels upcoming military exchanges with the
United States but [is unlikely to respond by fundamentally challenging
American interests because of arms sales to Taiwan. The purpose
of]{.underline} U.S. [arms sales is to enable Taiwan to ensure its own
self-defense]{.underline}. Fundamentally[, Taiwan's defense strategy
should focus on making a potential attack cost-prohibitive for
China]{.underline}. Therefore, [Taiwanese arms purchases should raise
the costs of Chinese offensive action]{.underline}. Since China's recent
military buildup poses a multi-faceted threat[, Taiwan should make
military investments with regard to land, sea, and air
capabilities---with a particular focus on asymmetric
systems,]{.underline} which are inexpensive weapons capable of taking on
much more expensive systems. With that in mind, [here are five things
that should be in the new package of U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}: [1. Anti-Ship & Anti-Submarine Capabilities
Much]{.underline} of the Chinese military buildup has been focused on
naval capabilities. Therefore, [small missile frigates are
indispensable, and selling Taiwan more of these ships would strengthen
its defense]{.underline}. [Undersea mines would also be an inexpensive
but highly effective system for]{.underline} Taiwanese
[investment]{.underline}. Mines would be useful in anti-submarine
warfare as well, especially as China increases in its sub fleet. [2.
Anti-Air Capabilities]{.underline} Another major aspect of China's
military buildup has been modernizing its air forces. Additionally,
China has an estimated 1,500 short-range ballistic missiles pointed at
Taiwan. In response, [Taiwan should invest even more heavily in missile
defense and anti-aircraft systems]{.underline}. After purchasing the
Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC) interceptors from the United States,
Taiwan has shown a commitment to continually upgrading its missile
defense, which is among the most modern systems in the world. Selling
Taiwan additional PAC-3 units or even the Terminal High Altitude Area
Defense (THAAD) system [would strengthen the island's anti-air
capabilities. Surface-to-air capabilities, such as Stinger missile
systems, could help support anti-air missions as well.]{.underline} [3.
Anti-Armor Capabilities In the event of a worst-case-scenario Chinese
invasion]{.underline}, Taiwan must continue to invest in land warfare
capabilities. [Anti-tank missiles such as the Javelin and
TOW]{.underline} (tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided) [are an
integral part of Taiwan's ability to deter land forces]{.underline}. [4.
Soft Capabilities Harder capabilities are enabled by intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance]{.underline} (ISR) [assets. Improving
Taiwan's ISR with long-range early warning radar systems would help
detect potential threats and benefit any future military operations. 5.
Aircraft]{.underline} For almost 10 years, both the Bush and Obama
Administrations have refused requests from Taiwan to purchase new
aircraft---often despite pressure from Congress. Taiwan's fleet of F-16s
dates back to 1992, but the United States has only agreed to sell
retrofit upgrades to the old planes. [F-16s are a relatively low-cost
aircraft for the capabilities they provide, and selling Taiwan new
planes would significantly bolster its defense arsenal]{.underline}. The
utility of any particular weapons system in Taiwan's specific strategic
environment is up for debate, but [the importance of these systems goes
beyond their military significance]{.underline}. Often, arms sales are
useful in signaling political support in addition to enabling defense
capabilities. With the upcoming Taiwanese presidential election in
January 2016, selling Taiwan the best defense technologies demonstrates
support for the island democracy regardless of which party wins.

#### Arms sales ensure the cost of conflict is too high for the PRC -- prevents conflict

While the United States was willing to tip the cross-strait balance
during the Cold War, that world disappeared long ago. [Taiwan simply
doesn't matter much for U.S. security]{.underline}. The island could act
as an offensive asset for use against the PRC, serving as a military
base in what otherwise would be Chinese waters. However, Washington
should avoid such a conflict, and that prospect only increases Beijing's
opposition to Taiwanese independence. The cultural and economic ties
between the United States and Taiwan are important, but limited[. The
bilateral diplomatic-political connection was effectively severed with
Washington's recognition of the PRC]{.underline}. [America is ever less
likely to intervene on Taiwan's behalf.]{.underline} Indeed[, the U.S.
policy of strategic ambiguity has become more dangerous as China's power
has increased]{.underline}. Taiwan matters much more to the PRC than
America. Thus, as a Chinese general not so subtly argued, the United
States won't risk Los Angeles for Taipei. Indeed, it would be madness
for America to do so. It might seem equally foolish for China to risk,
say, Shanghai to regain Taiwan. But it is far more plausible that the
PRC might do so. [Enabling Taiwan to defend itself is the best way out
of this]{.underline} conundrum. [So long as]{.underline} the
[residents]{.underline} of Zhongnanhai [value prosperity and stability,
they have reason to avoid costly conflict.]{.underline} [No arms sales
would enable Taipei to defeat a determined PRC]{.underline} in war.
[The]{.underline} former's [objective, however, should be deterrence,
not victory]{.underline}. "[The idea is to complicate China's
scenarios,]{.underline} [to make them pause,]{.underline} to get [them
to think twice before they attack]{.underline}," explained Rupert
Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council. [The
higher the price any PRC government would pay for attempting to coerce

patience would remain good sense. That doesn't mean there won't be

temporarily. There could be economic retaliation, though the threat
seems overblown: defense companies are barred from supplying the PRC and
[sanctions against civilian sales would hurt the PRC as
well]{.underline}. Taipei will face a continuing difficult challenge in
maintaining its independent international existence. [Washington should
establish a more routine weapons transfer process. Doing so would offer

#### China can't do anything about it -- pushbacks would hurt themselves more than Taiwan

BEIJING---Even as [China]{.underline} lashes out at Washington over a
\$1.83 billion arms package for Taiwan, [its options for punishing U.S.
companies involved in]{.underline} the [sales are limited]{.underline}.
This week's deal, the first arms sales to Taiwan authorized by the Obama
administration in four years, quickly drew anger from Beijing, which
sees such sales as interference in its sovereignty claims over the
self-ruled island. The deal "seriously impairs China's sovereignty and
security," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Thursday.
"China's government and enterprises won't cooperate with or do business
with companies" involved in arms sales to Taiwan. [Beijing has often
used its economic clout to help defend what it sees as key national
interests,]{.underline} whether by imposing punitive measures or
offering incentives. It first threatened sanctions against U.S.
companies selling arms to Taiwan nearly six years ago. [But Beijing has
limited means for swaying U.S. defense suppliers, which are barred from
military sales to China.]{.underline} "Such threats may work when
companies like Boeing are involved," said J. Michael Cole, a
Taipei-based senior fellow with the University of Nottingham's China
Policy Institute. ["But Raytheon and other purely defense firms that
under U.S. law cannot operate in, or sell to, China]{.underline}? [Much
less so, evidently." China could try to apply pressure on U.S. suppliers
by attacking their civilian commercial interests,]{.underline} some
analysts say, [though this may trigger retaliation from the U.S. against
Chinese firms---something Beijing can ill afford amid a deepening
economic slowdown]{.underline}. [Raytheon]{.underline} Co. [and Lockheed
Martin]{.underline} Corp., the main contractors involved in the latest
arms deal[, have commercial interests in China]{.underline}. [Lockheed
Martin's]{.underline} newly acquired unit Sikorsky Aircraft Corp. [sells
civilian helicopters in China, while Raytheon has sold civilian
air-traffic control systems and provided consultancy services in the
mainland]{.underline}. Neither firm immediately responded to requests to
comment. China has considered Taiwan a renegade province since 1949,
when the Nationalists retreated there after their defeat in a civil war.
The U.S. established diplomatic relations with Beijing in 1979, but also
passed a law that year obliging Washington to help Taiwan defend itself.
U.S. defense companies have sold more than \$500 million in weapons to
Taiwan since the last big government-brokered deal in 2011, which was
valued at \$5.9 billion. The latest sale comes just a month ahead of
Taiwan elections, in which the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party---which attracts supporters of Taiwanese independence---is tipped
to regain the presidency, buoyed by public resentment over the ruling
Nationalist Party's push to forge closer economic ties with the
mainland. Chinese state media acknowledged the significance of the
deal's timing, alleging that the U.S. was seeking to undermine
cross-Strait efforts to ease tensions---including last month's historic
dialogue between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Taiwan President Ma
Ying-jeou, the first such meeting since the Chinese civil war. "The
latest U.S. arms sale will set back the positive momentum as it serves
the interests of those seeking Taiwan's independence," the official
Xinhua News Agency said in a Thursday commentary. It also accused
Washington of breaking promises made in a 1982 joint communiqué in which
the U.S. pledged to gradually reduce and eventually halt arms sales to
Taiwan. [Beijing's latest warnings mirrored those it issued in 2010
after the U.S. approved \$6.4 billion in arms sales to
Taiwan.]{.underline} At the time, China also issued diplomatic protests
and suspended some military exchanges with the U.S., [though its threats
didn't]{.underline} appear to [yield any significant
impact.]{.underline} Boeing Co. and United Technologies Corp. were major
suppliers on that deal, but neither firm had direct military sales in
China---such sales have been banned by the U.S. since the 1989 crackdown
on Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. [Both firms continued to
export civilian goods to China,]{.underline} a major market for Boeing's
commercial-airplane arm and United Technologies' elevator division. It
isn't clear what steps China may take this time. Under the World Trade
Organization's rules, members can cite "essential security interests" to
justify trade restrictions. This could let Beijing quickly halt imports
from U.S. corporations without going through the WTO dispute-settlement
process, according to a 2010 paper written by a U.S. Navy official on
China's sanction threats. China could also apply nontrade measures to
punish U.S. companies, such as curbing their ability to participate in
bilateral investment, denying their executives entry into the mainland
or discouraging Chinese firms from doing business with them, said Cui
Fan, an international trade expert at the University of International
Business and Economics in Beijing. Chinese authorities can also block
U.S. contractors from government tenders, given that Beijing isn't a
signatory to the WTO side agreement on government procurement, Mr. Cui
said. [Another option is to halt purchases of civilian aircraft from
U.S. firms, a move that would hurt the likes of Boeing]{.underline}. In
2010, Chinese state media said Beijing could do so because it wasn't a
signatory to an international trade pact that curbs import duties on
planes and aircraft components, except for those bought for military
use. But [such a move would]{.underline} also [hurt China's aviation
sector, which remains highly reliant on imported
technology.]{.underline} [U.S. manufacturers provide key components for
Chinese-made commercial aircraft]{.underline}---including electronic
systems and engines---[and Beijing isn't likely to punish these
suppliers]{.underline}, said Zhou Jisheng, a retired aerospace engineer
who helped design China's first passenger jet, the ARJ21 regional
aircraft.

//ghs-ef)**

More fundamentally, [the accident was yet another step in the
deterioration of relations between Beijing and Taipei since the
election]{.underline} of Democratic Progressive Party president and
legislature. [Chinese leaders were unhappy about the victory
of]{.underline} the DPP's **[Tsai]{.underline}** Ing-wen as Taiwan's new
president, [even though she was not as strident in her advocacy of
formal independence for the island as the last DPP
president]{.underline}, Chen Shui-bian, had been. Even before she took
office in May, [Beijing warned Tsai and her supporters that they must
accept the so-called 1992 consensus that there was one
China]{.underline}, however much the two sides might disagree about the
specific definition of that concept. And that attitude has not softened
in the slightest. Zhang Zhijun, the head of the Taiwan Affairs Office,
put it bluntly to a visiting Taiwanese business delegation in late May.
"There is no future in Taiwan independence, and this cannot become an
option for Taiwan's future. This is the conclusion of history." He added
that "some people say you must pay attention to broad public opinion in
Taiwan," but he would have none of that reasoning. "Taiwan society ought
to understand and attach great importance to the feelings of the 1.37
billion residents of the mainland." At first Tsai waffled, and then
openly balked at accepting the 1992 consensus. Beijing's irritation
mounted quickly in response. In late June, barely a month after Tsai
took office, China severed all liaison contacts between the Taiwan
Affairs Office and its Taiwanese counterpart. [Rejecting the 1992
consensus was hardly Tsai's only offense from Beijing's standpoint.
Allies of her administration have pushed Taiwan's independent
territorial claims in the South China Sea]{.underline}. [She had
embarked on an extremely conciliatory policy toward China's
archstrategic adversary, Japan]{.underline}. And in early June, Taiwan
for the first time held a commemorative ceremony for the victims of the
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. That was an especially bold thumb in the
eye of Beijing's authorities. And to top matters off, Taiwan will be
testing its new antimissile systems in the United States later this
month. As the last item indicates, [the United States is far more than a
mere spectator to these developments]{.underline}. America has a
loosely-defined but nonetheless real obligation to defend Taiwan under
the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. Washington also continues to sell weapons
systems to Taipei. Beijing has complained about both aspects of this
relationship, but that seemed little more than an exercise in pro forma
diplomatic protests during the eight years that the conciliatory Ma
Ying-jeou and the Kuomintang party governed Taiwan. T[hat period of
stability has clearly come to an end, and the United States needs to
reconsider the wisdom of its security commitment to Taiwan]{.underline}.
Impatience on the part of Beijing, rash action on the part of
pro-independence Taiwanese, or just a bad accident could trigger a
crisis with devastating consequences for the United States. The latest
incident highlights the danger. Imagine if the fishing trawler the
Taiwanese missile struck had been from the mainland rather than Taiwan.
Imagine if it had been a Chinese naval vessel that was struck. One
suspects that Beijing's response would have been a lot less restrained.
The Taiwan Strait is a ticking time bomb. The Taiwanese people seem ever
more determined to chart their own destiny distinct from the mainland.
The mainland authorities are determined that reunification will take
place at some point, and their patience is not inexhaustible. It's hard
to see how this turns out well, and unless the United States extricates
itself from this increasingly dangerous commitment, it will be one of
the casualties when the time bomb explodes.

//ghs-ef)**

U.S.-China relations, never simple, are likely to be further complicated
by the expected landslide election tomorrow of Tsai Ing-wen as the new
president of the Republic of China on Taiwan. Tsai is the chair of the
traditionally pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party and many --
though not all -- of her supporters want Taiwan to declare formal
independence from China. [Tsai has been careful not to over-commit
herself on independence]{.underline} so as not to overly antagonize
China or the U.S. -- which is, in turn, worried about antagonizing
China. But given her party's pedigree[, China is likely to be less
friendly]{.underline}, if not overtly hostile, towards the new Tsai DPP
government. Note, China has never ruled out the use of military force to
ensure Taiwan's unification with the country. With that in mind, [it is
worth considering whether and to what extent the U.S. has an
obligation]{.underline} -- legal or otherwise -- [to defend Taiwan
against military action by China]{.underline}. Commentators, such as
Richard Bernstein writing in Foreign Policy, sometimes refer to a U.S.
obligation "to intervene if China launched an armed strike on Taiwan."
[As a legal matter, this is]{.underline} both not quite right and not
exactly [wrong]{.underline}. While **[the U.S. does not have a strict
legal obligation to defend Taiwan against an attack by
China]{.underline}**, in my view, the U.S. does not have a strict legal
obligation to defend its other allies either. Here, the relevant legal
document is the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). The legislation was enacted
by Congress in 1979 following the U.S. decision to cut ties with Taiwan,
abrogate the U.S.-Republic of China (Taiwan) Mutual Defense Treaty, and
establish relations with China. The TRA is frequently cited by U.S.
policymakers as the legal framework governing Taiwan policy actions. In
reality, although [the TRA]{.underline} has practical importance for
civil and commercial relations with Taiwan[, it does not strictly bind
U.S. policymakers with respect to US-China-Taiwan
relations.]{.underline}

//ghs-ef)**

A recent article in Bloomberg indicates that the [Obama]{.underline}
Administration will soon announce the first U.S. arms sale to Taiwan
since 2011. The four-year gap since the last round of sales is the
longest period of time without an arms deal since the 1979 Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA) defined the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. [When the
United States established diplomatic relations with the People's
Republic of China, it severed official diplomatic ties with
Taiwan]{.underline}, which it had previously recognized as the
government of China. [Congress passed the TRA to facilitate continued
non-diplomatic relations between America and Taiwan and help maintain
peace and security in the region. One important aspect of the TRA is
that it requires the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to "make
available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such
quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability]{.underline}." Since 1979, every president has
announced multiple arms sales to Taiwan. The [Obama]{.underline}
Administration [has sold \$12 billion worth of military equipment to
Taiwan, but the four-year break led to bipartisan pressure from Congress
to announce another round of sales]{.underline}. The reported \$1
billion in new arms sales to Taiwan would relieve congressional pressure
but would also be likely to increase tension in the U.S.-China
relationship. The Chinese government, which opposes the sale of military
equipment to Taiwan, usually responds negatively to arms deal
announcements. China often cancels upcoming military exchanges with the
United States but is unlikely to respond by fundamentally challenging
American interests because of arms sales to Taiwan. [The purpose of U.S.
arms sales is to enable Taiwan to ensure its own self-defense.
Fundamentally, Taiwan's defense strategy should focus on making a
potential attack cost-prohibitive for China. **Therefore, Taiwanese arms
purchases should raise the costs of Chinese offensive
action**]{.underline}. **[Since China's recent military buildup poses a
multi-faceted threat, Taiwan should make military investments with
regard to land, sea, and air capabilities---with a particular focus on
asymmetric systems]{.underline}**, [which are inexpensive weapons
capable of taking on much more expensive systems]{.underline}. With that
in mind, [here are five things that should be in]{.underline} the new
package of [U.S. arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}: 1. [Anti-Ship &
Anti-Submarine Capabilities]{.underline} [Much of the Chinese military
buildup has been focused on naval capabilities. Therefore, small missile
frigates are indispensable, and selling Taiwan more of these ships would
strengthen its defense]{.underline}. Undersea mines would also be an
inexpensive but highly effective system for Taiwanese investment. Mines
would be useful in anti-submarine warfare as well, especially as China
increases in its sub fleet. 2. [Anti-Air Capabilities]{.underline}
[Another major aspect of China's military buildup has been modernizing
its air forces]{.underline}. Additionally, China has an estimated 1,500
short-range ballistic missiles pointed at Taiwan. In response, **[Taiwan
should invest even more heavily in missile defense and anti-aircraft
systems]{.underline}**. After purchasing the Patriot Advanced Capability
(PAC) interceptors from the United States, Taiwan has shown a commitment
to continually upgrading its missile defense, which is among the most
modern systems in the world. [Selling Taiwan additional PAC-3 units
or]{.underline} even the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
(**[THAAD]{.underline}**) system **[would strengthen the island's
anti-air capabilities]{.underline}**. [Surface-to-air capabilities, such
as Stinger missile systems, could help support anti-air missions as
well]{.underline}. 3. Anti-Armor Capabilities In the event of a
worst-case-scenario Chinese invasion, [Taiwan must continue to invest in
land warfare capabilities]{.underline}. Anti-tank missiles such as the
Javelin and TOW (tube-launched, optically tracked, wire-guided) are an
integral part of Taiwan's ability to deter land forces. 4. Soft
Capabilities [Harder capabilities are enabled by]{.underline}
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance ([ISR)
assets]{.underline}. [Improving Taiwan's ISR with long-range early
warning radar systems would help detect potential threats]{.underline}
and benefit any future military operations. 5. Aircraft [For almost 10
years]{.underline}, both the Bush and Obama [Administrations have
refused requests from Taiwan to purchase new
aircraft]{.underline}---often despite pressure from Congress. [Taiwan's
fleet of F-16s dates back to 1992]{.underline}, but the United States
has only agreed to sell retrofit upgrades to the old planes. F-16s are a
relatively low-cost aircraft for the capabilities they provide, and
[selling Taiwan new planes would significantly bolster its defense
arsenal.]{.underline} The utility of any particular weapons system in
Taiwan's specific strategic environment is up for debate, but **[the
importance of these systems goes beyond their military significance.
Often, arms sales are useful in signaling political support in addition
to enabling defense capabilities]{.underline}**. With the upcoming
Taiwanese presidential election in January 2016, selling Taiwan the best
defense technologies demonstrates support for the island democracy
regardless of which party wins.

[Taiwan is the **fulcrum** of the rivalry between China and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Yes, issues like trade and
technology are crucial. But [when it comes to **security**]{.underline},
**[geopolitics]{.underline}**, [and **global leadership**]{.underline}
(both moral and political), [Taiwan\'s]{.underline} future---its
**[strength]{.underline}**, its sovereignty, its form of
government---[is **paramount**]{.underline}. [And tensions over the
island are only **rising**]{.underline}. On Sunday, two Chinese J-11
fighter jets crossed the Taiwan Strait\'s median line, the de facto
maritime border between China and Taiwan. In response, the Taiwanese
military scrambled fighter planes to intercept the Chinese jets, which
continued their incursion for about 10 minutes. \"It was an intentional,
reckless, and provocative action,\" Taiwan\'s Ministry of Foreign
Affairs said of the incident. \"We\'ve informed regional partners and
condemn China for such behavior.\" Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen
called for the \"forceful expulsion\" of Chinese warplanes next time
they cross the median line. The standoff marks one of the most serious
Chinese incursions across the maritime border in 20 years. Chinese jets
flew across the line frequently until 1999, when China and Taiwan
reached a tacit agreement to stop the practice. Since then, there have
been rare Chinese incursions, which have largely been considered
accidents, including the last such incident in 2011. Sunday\'s
provocation, which appears to be intentional, is the latest sign of
increased Chinese pressure on Taiwan. In recent years, China has tried
to squeeze Taipei economically and diplomatically through various
means---inducing countries to sever relations with the island, forcing
Taiwan out of international organizations like the World Health
Organization, and more. China is also prepared to use its military to
pressure the island. In a report released in January, the Defense
Intelligence Agency identifies Beijing\'s desire to \"compel Taiwan\'s
reunification with the mainland and deter any attempt by Taiwan to
declare independence\" as the \"primary driver for China\'s military
modernization.\" Recently, Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed a
willingness to use his country\'s military might against Taiwan. \"China
must be, and will be reunified,\" he said in a speech in January. \"We
do not forsake the use of force.\" With its incursion on Sunday, perhaps
China wants to test Taiwan\'s response and see how far it can go with
such provocations. [The situation in the Taiwan Strait is also a
**test** for President **Trump**]{.underline}. [For
decades]{.underline}, [the U.S. has pursued a delicate
policy]{.underline}: **[deter]{.underline}** [China from attacking
Taiwan]{.underline}, [while reassuring Beijing that Washington will not
accept Taiwanese independence]{.underline}---in other words, maintain
the status quo. [But China\'s military posture toward Taiwan has only
grown **more aggressive**]{.underline}, [and Chinese leaders are not
giving up on reunification]{.underline}, not for one second. Indeed,
China seems to believe that the U.S. will sit by as Beijing has its way
with Taipei. So how will the U.S. respond? Last week, the U.S. Navy
sailed a missile-guided destroyer and a Coast Guard cutter through the
Taiwan Strait for the third month in a row, to ensure that vessels can
navigate freely through the waterway. The [operations are]{.underline}
clearly [**messages** to China]{.underline}, which claims the strait as
its own and has adamantly opposed the moves with strong condemnations.
Such [operations are **necessary** and **important**]{.underline}, but
far from sufficient. [Trump can take **additional steps** to assure
Taiwan of America\'s commitment to the island\'s
**democracy**]{.underline}, [free of Chinese rule]{.underline}, [and to
**deter China** from using force to compel reunification]{.underline}.
[The most obvious step is to **expedite** Taiwan\'s request to buy
**F-16V fighter jets** from the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Tsai confirmed Taiwan\'s request during a speech
in Hawaii last week. [The looming sale]{.underline} of course
[**angers** Beijing]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [must **approve** the
sale]{.underline}, [to **bolster** Taiwan\'s military
capabilities]{.underline}, [which are far less formidable than
China\'s]{.underline}, especially in the air. [Trump should also order
his State Department to launch a **concerted effort** with]{.underline}
America\'s [allies in Asia to present a more **united
front**]{.underline} [against China\'s bullying against
Taiwan]{.underline}. [Washington will]{.underline} have some
**[receptive]{.underline}**
[audiences]{.underline}---[Japan]{.underline}, for example,
**[shares]{.underline}** Taiwan\'s **[concerns]{.underline}** about
Chinese aggression in the western Pacific. Of course the U.S. does not
want to be too aggressive and provoke a war with China over Taiwan, but
[Washington must **push back** and establish a **more robust** posture
of deterrence]{.underline}. [America\'s interest in Taiwan goes
**beyond**]{.underline} [a]{.underline} moral [belief in]{.underline}
freedom and [democracy]{.underline} overcoming ruthless oppression. [If
the U.S. were to **abandon** Taiwan]{.underline} in the event of a
Chinese attack, [it would signal to the rest of Washington\'s **allies**
in Asia]{.underline}---and even in Europe and the Middle East---[that
they could not count on American guarantees]{.underline}. Indeed, [they
would look **elsewhere** for security]{.underline}, [and the American
**network** of allies]{.underline}, [which gives the U.S. **unparalleled
global power**]{.underline}, [could]{.underline} very well
[collapse]{.underline}. But even beyond morality and allies, [Taiwan is
the critical point of the so-called]{.underline} \"**[first island
chain]{.underline}**,\" the first line of archipelagos off the east
Asian continental coastline. [In order for China to challenge American
dominance in the Pacific]{.underline}, [it would need to break through
that chain]{.underline}, [which is composed of American
allies]{.underline}. For China, [**Taiwan** is the spot where it can
break through]{.underline}. So [if the U.S. is concerned about **Chinese
ambitions**]{.underline}, [or about the **world order**]{.underline}
[that has brought]{.underline} so much **[global
prosperity]{.underline}**, [it must be willing to **defend
Taiwan**]{.underline}, hoping that day never comes. [China is banking on
an **asymmetry** of stakes]{.underline}, [meaning that]{.underline}, in
a conflict over Taiwan, [while the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates may have [important interests at
stake]{.underline}, [they are not as important as the interests that
China has at stake]{.underline}. For Chinese leaders, beyond projecting
its power into the Pacific, reunifying Taiwan is about their regime
surviving. How can the Communist Party rule with any legitimacy and
promote its model of governance when a tiny island can prosper just a
few miles away as an independent democracy? The U.S. may be fighting for
important interests, but not for the survival and legitimacy of the
American government. [Trump can take actions **now** to alter China\'s
thinking]{.underline}, [to **deter Xi** and **assure** the
Taiwanese]{.underline}. There is no time to waste.

Beijing that its policies toward Taiwan are unchanged. Mattis delivered
that message to China's Defense Minister Wei Fenghe personally on
Thursday, on the sidelines of an Asian security forum. "Minister [Wei

Washington has sold Taiwan more than \$15 billion in weaponry since

flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, which also include a bitter
trade war, U.S. sanctions and China's increasingly muscular military
posture in the South China Sea. Mattis told Wei on Thursday that the

At their meeting at Mar-a-Lago, U.S. President Donald [Trump
and]{.underline} Chinese leader [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [supposedly
became new best friends]{.underline}. As a result, Trump said he would
not, for now, declare China a currency manipulator and impose new trade
sanctions, as he had promised to do during the campaign. In exchange for
this forbearance, Beijing would presumably use its unique leverage to
pressure North Korea to end the nuclear and ballistic missile programs
China has supported and enabled for over two decades. Shortly after
their meeting, [Trump seemed to throw in a further concession, **this
one on Taiwan**]{.underline}. [He said he would]{.underline} have to
[check with Xi before having another phone conversation
with]{.underline} Taiwan's president, [Tsai]{.underline} Ing-wen ---
[after his unprecedented first one had angered Beijing]{.underline} and
confounded China experts. Trump thus linked North Korea and Taiwan, two
East Asian flashpoints that threaten to ignite U.S.-China conflict.
Regarding the third potential crisis-generator --- China's aggressive
actions in the South China Sea --- nothing was said publicly by either
capital during or after the Florida meeting. China's militarization of
its artificial islands continued apace. Trump was uncharacteristically
silent on the subject, but his actions spoke louder than words. He
unleashed the U.S. Navy to conduct full-fledged freedom of navigation
operations to challenge China's illegal territorial claims, a contrast
to the Obama administration's watered-down innocent passages. **[Now it
is time for the president also to address two other matters
long-neglected by his predecessors, both affecting the security of
Taiwan]{.underline}**. [The first is the question of arms sales to
Taiwan]{.underline}, administration action mandated by the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA) of 1979. Passage of the TRA by veto-proof margins
reflected congressional anger at the Carter administration's severing
diplomatic relations with Taipei in favor of Beijing and termination of
the U.S.-Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty. Ever since, [Congress has pushed
successive administrations to fulfill U.S. legal obligations to sell
Taiwan the weapons it needs to defend itself against Chinese
aggression.]{.underline} The [executive]{.underline} branch [has often
demurred, delayed, and denied Taiwan's requests]{.underline}, sometimes
for good reason, such as inadequate strategic planning, technical
proficiency, or committed funding. But every sale, no matter how large
or how advanced the weaponry involved, inevitably meets with fierce
opposition from the People's Republic, threatening to jeopardize the
entire U.S.-China relationship. And [Washington, ever-sensitive to
Beijing's moods, has been on the defensive about Taiwan's defensive
arms]{.underline}. That was particularly true of the [Obama]{.underline}
administration, which [shelved a package of essential arms that had long
been pending]{.underline}. Now the Trump team is reported to be putting
together an even more robust arms deal but is delaying its announcement
for fear of interrupting China's promised help with North Korea. The
problem is that despite its rhetoric, [Beijing]{.underline}, again, [is
not delivering, and Pyongyang knows it still has China's indulgence to
move ahead with its weapons programs]{.underline}. **[Trump
should]{.underline}** show China that he cannot be strung along and
**[approve the Taiwan arms sale expeditiously]{.underline}**. While he
is at it, [the president should correct a decades-long mistake in U.S.
policy: the **unwillingness to state forthrightly that America will
defend its**]{.underline} democratic **[ally against]{.underline}** any
aggressive moves by **[China]{.underline}**. [That means
abandoning]{.underline} the outdated doctrine of [strategic ambiguity,
which states that we might or might not defend Taiwan "depending on the
circumstances."]{.underline} Since 1995, when the official equivocation
was explicitly declared by the State Department as a cautionary amber
light, China has read it instead as an inviting green light to build up
its surface and underwater fleets and ballistic missile arsenal to
create "the circumstances" that would keep the United States away from a
cross-strait conflict. The Chinese deterrent strategy, known as
anti-access and area denial, shows signs of working: [if Washington is
reluctant to do all it can to help Taiwan defend itself, why should
Beijing expect that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will
itself step directly into the fray?]{.underline} **[Only a
straightforward declaration by the U.S. president will convince China of
that commitment]{.underline}**. Donald [Trump is the one best positioned
to provide China, Taiwan, the region, and the world with the strategic
clarity that this Asian flashpoint requires]{.underline}.

[China and Taiwan marked the Lunar New Year holiday]{.underline} this
week [with]{.underline} dueling [propaganda videos showcasing their
respective military might]{.underline}, released on social media. It was
the latest sign that North Korea may no longer be the world's most
volatile hotspot, the nation most likely to unleash a major crisis that
could spiral out of control. Now **[that dubious distinction may be
shifting to Taiwan]{.underline}**. The [root of the problem
is]{.underline}, of course, [that China considers Taiwan an inextricable
part of its territory ripped away in 1949]{.underline} when the
government of the Republic of China, facing military defeat against
communist forces on the mainland, moved to the island. Beijing always
saw this as temporary---something to be rectified when it had the power
to do so. Now that time is at hand. Massive [economic growth has given
China a degree of influence and resilience that it never had
before]{.underline}. Its [military capabilities have grown
extensively]{.underline}. And while America has long been committed to
Taiwan's separation from China, the [**willingness and ability** of the
United States to back Taipei with force **seems shakier than
ever**]{.underline}. [For strategists in Beijing]{.underline},
[**imposing reunification on Taiwan probably appears more feasible**
than at any time since 1949]{.underline}. What is making the situation
particularly dangerous now is China's mounting internal problems,
especially a slowing economy. Its short-term economic prospects, at
least, are troubling. This matters because the Chinese Communist Party
sustains its rule in part by buying off internal dissatisfaction. The
[Chinese people tolerate authoritarianism in exchange for stability and
prosperity. But if economic imbalances and problems mount, the Communist
Party may have a harder time fending off political
opposition]{.underline}. As often happens in authoritarian political
systems, economic frustration could turn into dissent. Undoubtedly, this
would lead the regime in Beijing to ramp up its system of internal
security, which is already the most effective on earth. Authoritarian
regimes facing internal opposition have always tried to ease political
pressure through distraction, specifically by becoming more externally
aggressive or exaggerating security threats, whether foreign or
internal. [If China experiences a deep and long-term economic slowdown,
it is not hard to imagine the government taking a more bellicose
approach to Taiwan]{.underline}. There are already ominous signs of
that. Last month, an editorial in **[China's official military newspaper
stated that "war preparations" should be a top priority for the
year]{.underline}**. The next day, President Xi Jinping reiterated
China's longstanding position that it reserves the right to use force
against Taiwan if it considers it necessary. This may foreshadow a
coming crisis. [What is not clear at this point is how the United States
would]{.underline}, or should, [respond if China attempts to compel
reunification with Taiwan]{.underline}. President Donald [Trump seems
more committed to the defense of Taiwan than his predecessors, having
approved arms sales to Taipei at a much faster rate]{.underline}. And in
December he signed the pro-Taiwan Asia Reassurance Initiative Act into
law, which aims to counter China's military influence in the region and
boost U.S. support for allies like Taiwan, including arms sales. The
**[key for the United States is lowering the chances of China believing
it can impose reunification by force]{.underline}**. But would Trump use
military force to defend Taiwan? Even without large-scale U.S.
involvement, [China might not be able to conquer Taiwan
outright]{.underline}. Conventional military invasions across bodies of
water are extremely difficult. And time would not be on Beijing's side
since any invasion would be disruptive, even catastrophic, for both the
global economy and China, which depends on exports of manufactured goods
and imports of energy and raw materials to sustain its economy. The
[United States might respond to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan with
long-range military strikes plus standoff air defense, anti-ship, space
and cyber operations]{.underline}. But **["might" is the operative
word]{.underline}**. U.S. involvement would entail massive risk. There
is the potential that Americans might simply accept the conquest of
Taiwan. Things would be even more difficult for Washington if China
opted for the sort of "gray zone" aggression that Russia has used to
weaken Ukraine---avoiding an outright military invasion and relying on
other destabilizing methods that combine political, economic, military
and technological interference to avoid provoking a devastating response
from the United States. This would be particularly tricky for Washington
if China were able to replicate what Russia did in Ukraine and find
local allies or proxies. The key for the United States, then, is
lowering the chances of China believing it can impose reunification by
force. Since the 1970s, [U.S. policy toward Taiwan has been based on a
deliberate strategic ambiguity as part of the so-called One China
policy]{.underline}. Washington opposed reunification by force but did
not treat Taiwan as a sovereign, independent nation. It indicated that
it would oppose a Chinese invasion of Taiwan but never made clear
precisely what it would do in response to one. The idea was to
complicate Beijing's strategic calculation by making it guess what the
United States would do. [Ambiguity made sense when China was
economically and militarily weak, but **now that is increasingly
dangerous**]{.underline}. **[To minimize the chances of miscalculation,
Beijing must understand the military, economic and political costs of
aggression against Taiwan]{.underline}**, [including the possibility
that the United States might strike China indirectly or
asymmetrically]{.underline}. To make that happen, the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [should work closely with Congress to
reinforce America's support for Taiwan's continued
autonomy]{.underline}. [Trump should specify what Chinese actions
against Taiwan the United States considers unacceptable, and what it
would do in response to them]{.underline}. There is no guarantee this
will work. There may be a crisis or conflict over Taiwan no matter what
the United States does. But [it is incumbent on American leaders to
diminish the chances of miscalculation]{.underline}. [This requires
firming up the U.S. commitment to Taiwan, in order to **transform
strategic ambiguity into clarity**]{.underline}.

The [question]{.underline}, therefore, [is what Beijing will do when it
realizes that growing economic interaction will not translate into
support for unification]{.underline}. Coercion, or **[use of
force]{.underline}**, **[could then become more appealing to the
C]{.underline}**hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[P]{.underline}**arty, [especially if it believes it can do so at a
relatively low cost]{.underline} --- in other words, if it is convinced
that the U.S. will not intervene. A lot of publicity has surrounded the
ongoing U.S. strategic "pivot" to Asia, which for the most part many
would argue was prompted by developments in the South China Sea and
calls by some of the claimants, principally the Philippines and Vietnam,
for U.S. assistance in countering a resurgent China. Publicly, [while
Washington has re-emphasized its engagement with allies in the
region]{.underline}, from Japan to Australia, [in most instances
Washington has omitted mentioning Taiwan as a regional
partner]{.underline}. This was ostensibly to avoid undermining warming
ties between Taipei and Beijing. A [number of factors]{.underline},
however, [cast serious doubts on the wisdom of excluding Taiwan from the
"pivot."]{.underline} Among them is the fact that [Beijing may be using
the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea
[disputes]{.underline}, which it can wage at relatively low cost by
relying mostly on maritime surveillance ships and fishing vessels, [as a
distraction or a sideshow]{.underline}, [while continuing to build up
its military forces facing Taiwan]{.underline}. Were **[the
U.S.]{.underline}** to reorient its military predominantly for the
purposes of addressing a South China Sea contingency (e.g. by favoring
deployments in Southeast Asia or as far south as Australia), it **[could
find itself unprepared, if not unable, to deal with an attack on
Taiwan]{.underline}**. Through its belligerence in the South China Sea
--- an area whose importance is only secondary to its goal of
unification with Taiwan --- China has also repeatedly and
unapologetically displayed its fixation on "history," often at the
expense of international law or multilateral approaches to conflict
resolution. While this intransigence bodes ill for the possibility of
resolving sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea, [it portends even
more ominously for China's approach to political negotiations with
Taiwan, which in turn could make the military option more likely at some
point in the future]{.underline}. The **[best way to avoid war over
Taiwan]{.underline}** and to ensure that U.S. forces are not
wrong-footed should such a scenario unfold, therefore, **[is for
Washington to put an end to its strategic ambiguity and to clearly state
that it will defend Taiwan should China threaten force against
it]{.underline}**. By doing so, [the U.S. would not only ensure that
Beijing does not miscalculate by believing it can use the military
option on the cheap]{.underline} --- thereby **[lowering the probability
of armed conflict]{.underline}** --- [it would also provide Taipei with
the backing it needs to negotiate with Beijing]{.underline} as an equal
rather than a weaker party coerced into making political concessions
against the wishes of its population. The responsibility does not lie
with the U.S. alone, however. [Taiwan must also demonstrate that it is
committed to defending itself and to assuming its role as an ally of the
U.S. in Asia]{.underline}. Among other things, this calls for meeting
the goal of allocating at least 3 percent of GDP for the national
defense budget and making sure that an ongoing program to create an
all-volunteer military by 2015 is handled properly and given sufficient
funding, which for the moment remains in doubt. U.S.-Taiwan military
cooperation, though generally kept away from public view, remains
healthy, but much more can be done at the political level to signal that
the relationship is durable and mutually beneficial. In other words,
[Taiwan may also have to abandon the ambiguous language the Ma
administration has used in recent years to facilitate rapprochement with
China]{.underline}. Simply stated: **[The usefulness of ambiguity has
passed.]{.underline}** While the Obama administration, breaking the
precedent set by previous administrations, took a conciliatory approach
to China when it entered office, it has since realized that [Beijing
does not intend to play by the rules and remains, despite wishes to the
contrary, an irresponsible stakeholder on several important
issues]{.underline}.

The fact of the matter is, [use of force in the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}, possibly drawing in the United States and costing
tens of thousands of lives, [would signify a failure by
all]{.underline}. **[The]{.underline}**y **[key is to never reach this
point]{.underline}**. And [the best way to reduce the risks of such a
scenario coming to pass is to bolster Taiwan's deterrence]{.underline}.
[**Reducing that deterrent**, by "abandoning" Taiwan or explicitly
stating that the United States would not come to its assistance should
it be attacked by the China, **is an invitation for the CCP to conclude
that it can quickly achieve its objectives**]{.underline}, at minimum
cost, **[through use of force]{.underline}**. Thus, I and others have
argued that **[Washington's "strategic ambiguity" in the Taiwan Strait
has outlived its utility, and that a clearer stance on what kind of
action would trigger a U.S. military response is now necessary to avoid
Chinese miscalculation and military adventurism]{.underline}**.
[Goldstein and I agree that some "red line" needs to be drawn
somewhere]{.underline}. We part when he posits that this line ought not
to be drawn in the Taiwan Strait. I would argue that this is the best
place to draw it. [Yes, this would be "escalatory," and yes there would
be risks involved]{.underline}. But [the geopolitics of a rising
revisionist power with territorial ambitions will always give rise to
risk---avoidance cannot be the prescribed response]{.underline}
(Goldstein's reference to Chinese use of nuclear weapons oddly fails to
take into account the overwhelming, and utterly ruinous for the
instigator, nuclear retaliation by the United States should Beijing use
such weapons). Lastly, as he did in his book, [Goldstein maintains that
the best approach to resolving the Taiwan "issue" would be via
"de-escalation spirals."]{.underline} He rightly points out that a
"peace process is, almost by definition, imperfect, as it necessarily
involves compromises." What he does not seem to recognize is the fact
that most, if not all, of the necessary compromises would have to be
made by the Taiwanese side, chief among them the loss of the de
factoindependence they have enjoyed. He then proposes that the "one
country, two systems" formula, an "impressively pragmatic framework,"
would be the best mechanism by which to achieve some sort of balance.
[This is where Goldstein enters the realm of **fantasy or amnesia---I
don't know which**]{.underline}. The [Hong Kong experience has made it
very clear that the formula was a smokescreen, and that the political
system that has existed in the Special Administrative Region is rapidly
coming under the control of the central government in
Beijing]{.underline}. For a while the world believed that Beijing meant
it when it committed to respecting the way of life and system of Hong
Kong; in reality, [it never masked its real intentions to control it
fully, as residents of the SAR are now realizing, what with the
threatened ban on "separatist" political parties]{.underline}, the
jailing of young pro-democracy activists, loss of control of immigration
and a marked erosion of press freedoms, to name just a few of the more
salient recent developments. To argue that this formula is "impressively
pragmatic" or that it is suited for Taiwan is naive at best, and more
likely disingenuous. It rests on a fantasy, on the failed notion that an
increasingly paranoid CCP under Xi Jinping would willingly relinquish
power and countenance the existence, within the PRC, of a political
system at variance with the CCP worldview. That is why [the idea of a
negotiated settlement]{.underline}, as he proposes, [is such a remote
possibility: on Taiwan, Beijing will not genuinely negotiate---it would
conquer, vanquish, pacify, and then move on]{.underline}. If the Hong
Kong debacle isn't enough, developments across China, the manner in
which dissidents, activists, lawyers, Christians, Buddhists,
homosexuals, journalists, academics, Muslims and others have been
treated, should be enough to disabuse any Taiwanese of the notion that
their way of life under "one country, two systems" would be vouchsafed.
Goldstein's papering over this litany of ills and neglect of the CCP's
terrible track record on human rights is simply astonishing. [No party
in his right mind would dream of negotiating with a regime that has now
proven itself capable of turning an entire region into a
virtual]{.underline} (and quite Orwellian) [concentration camp, which is
what Xinjiang is rapidly turning into, according to several reputable
accounts]{.underline}. I have no doubt that Goldstein is making his case
with the United States' best interests at heart and that he means well.
I also have great respect for his accomplishments as an analyst of the
Chinese military and have turned to him in the past for insights.
Unfortunately, **[I do not think that the U.S. interest is best served
by ignoring]{.underline}**, as he does, **[the true nature of the CCP,
or by downplaying the importance of defending allied
democracies]{.underline}**. Whether he likes it or not, [Taiwan is in
the frontline of an ongoing battle]{.underline}---and it is heating
up---[to determine the kind of world we and our children will live in
for years to come.]{.underline}

Since [there is no reason to believe that]{.underline} either [President
Trump]{.underline} nor President Clinton [intends]{.underline} (or would
have the ability) [to undermine that delicate balance, whatever change
occurs in Washington's relationship with the two Asian neighbors will by
necessity have to be qualitative rather than fundamental]{.underline}. A
fundamental shift---e.g., the abandonment of Taiwan or full containment
of China---would undo that stability by either allowing the unification
of Taiwan against the will of its people or sparking major hostilities
in the Taiwan Strait. Those are two scenarios that very few people in
Washington want to see become a reality, if only because of the wider
repercussions that either of those two contingencies would have on the
region and the world. Assumption One is therefore that [the future U.S.
president and]{.underline} his/her [advisers will want the continuation
of stability in the Taiwan Strait, as it is in the United States'
national interest]{.underline}---any U.S. president's first and foremost
consideration---that such a state of affairs be maintained. The second
assumption is that [China's recent behavior]{.underline}, both
domestically and within its immediate region, [has attuned both the
Republican and the Democratic parties to the destabilizing potential of
Chinese assertiveness]{.underline}. Thus, given the ramifications for
Washington's allies, [it is highly unlikely]{.underline} (regardless of
what they may say now) [that either candidate would adopt policies that
include the abandonment of U.S. allies to their fate]{.underline}.
Whether they want to or not, **[the United States is back in Asia and
here to stay]{.underline}**, for the same reasons that aliment the first
assumption: the desire for stability. On Taiwan specifically, Assumption
Two implies that [Washington will be prepared to provide to Taiwan
assistance such as is necessary to ensure continued stability in the
Taiwan Strait]{.underline}. And that will only occur if Taiwan has the
wherewithal to respond to and counter Beijing's continued---and
ostensibly intensifying---efforts to isolate it internationally while
undermining its democratic institutions. [Such assistance will come in
various forms. Although there is a military component to the U.S. policy
on Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act and Six Assurances, it is
highly unlikely any future U.S. president would choose to rock the boat
by markedly increasing American military assistance for
Taiwan]{.underline}, either through the deployment of active military
personnel on Taiwanese soil or the sale of U.S. defense articles that
would suddenly alter the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait (e.g.,
F-35s or THAAD anti--ballistic missile systems). Instead, a President
Clinton or Trump will likely continue to release arms packages that,
while disappointing to some, have more political than defensive value.
The [future U.S. president should also green-light further U.S.
technical assistance for indigenous defense programs initiated by
Taiwan]{.underline} (e.g., submarines) and would also be advised to
refrain from punishing Taiwan for deploying, within reason,
"counterforce" or "offensive" weapons systems that have a deterrent
value against the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Reluctance to cross
Beijing's "red lines" on arms sales should not prevent a deepening of
U.S. assistance in other areas. The future U.S. president should
therefore increase joint training opportunities for Taiwanese military
and law enforcement personnel (e.g., Urban Shield), as well as civilian
search-and-rescue teams. Existing military training programs for
Taiwanese personnel in the United States should continue and while other
areas of cooperation (e.g., inviting Taiwan to participate in/observe
RIMPAC) should be explored. More American cadets should be involved in
exchange and language programs with Taiwan through the Fulbright program
or others, and those should be appropriately funded via the Department
of Defense. Intelligence sharing---human and electronic---should
continue and be increased as appropriate, including the bolstering of
information that contributes to Taiwan's situational awareness. **[To
reduce the risks of miscalculation and adventurism, the future U.S.
president would also be advised to move away from strategic ambiguity on
Taiwan and reinforce the notion that any unwarranted move by the PLA
against Taiwan would not be countenanced and would immediately prompt a
response from the international community. Rather than provoke China,
drawing lines in the sea would help reduce the risks of war by
increasing the costs of any move in that direction]{.underline}**.
**[Nothing would be more dangerous at this point than for Beijing to
convince]{.underline}** itself, out of hubris or frustration, **[that it
can quickly resolve the Taiwan "question" by resorting to
force]{.underline}**.

(Donald, *The China Fallacy*, p.161-162)

[If China were to permanently eliminate the missiles facing
Taiwan]{.underline}, [while significantly and verifiably reducing and
redeploying the air and naval forces currently threatening the
island]{.underline}, [Taiwan\'s security would be markedly
improved]{.underline}. [This outcome can be achieved through **mutual
threat reduction measures** that **reduce**]{.underline}, eliminate and
redeploy [advanced weapons and military equipment that]{.underline}
either [Taiwan or China could employ in the event of
conflict]{.underline}. [Such measures would make it far more difficult
for either side to threaten or intimidate the other for political
purposes]{.underline}, [in addition to significantly lowering their
capacity to wreak destruction during an actual war]{.underline}.
[Because Taiwan is]{.underline} now [militarily inferior to China with
regard to missiles]{.underline}, [naval vessels and air force
assets]{.underline}, [it **lacks the diplomatic leverage** to eliminate
the security threat that China poses]{.underline}. Short of agreeing to
reunification---which is currently opposed by a majority of Taiwan\'s
citizens---[there are no measures Taiwan can offer as **a sufficient
quid pro quo to secure significant Chinese arms
reductions**]{.underline}. And, [without reciprocal security
measures]{.underline}, [China **refuses to engage in**]{.underline} what
it considers **["unilateral disarmament."]{.underline}** By contrast,
[the U.S. is **capable of securing a drastic reduction in China\'s
military threat to Taiwan** by offering **reciprocal military measures**
that would lead to **far greater stability in the region**]{.underline},
[creating a transformed regional security environment]{.underline}.
[China is highly likely to reduce]{.underline}, redeploy and eliminate
[its missile]{.underline}, [naval and air forces now threatening the
island]{.underline}, **[in exchange for the U.S. pulling back
forces]{.underline}** now engaged in surveillance and patrolling of
Chinese territory, **[significantly reducing U.S. military deployments
in the Asia Pacific]{.underline}**, and scaling down major arms sales to
Taiwan. It is also important to recall that Taiwan\'s prior negotiations
with China on long-term political issues reflect the profound difficulty
the two sides face in reaching an agreement that could truly stabilize
their relations for the foreseeable future. Taiwan understandably fears
being absorbed by China, knowing full well that Beijing\'s foremost
objective is national reunification at the earliest possible time. A
large majority of Taiwan\'s people reject Beijing\'s promise to
guarantee the island\'s autonomy and democratic political system through
a so-called "one country, two systems" formula. For its part, China
worries that Taiwan\'s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), though
currently out of power, could strongly re-emerge in the future, and once
again lead a drive for political independence which effectively thwarts
national reunification. [A Framework Agreement would strengthen the
security of Taiwan]{.underline} and the preservation of its democratic
political system [without requiring it to agree to eventual
reunification with China]{.underline}. [It would be entirely up to the
Taiwanese government and people whether to conduct bilateral
negotiations on political reunification at some future
time]{.underline}. [The two sides would be able to carry out their
negotiations in a largely **non-threatening and stable security
environment**]{.underline}, [which would help support]{.underline}, [in

political issues]{.underline}**. [Eliminating the Risk of a U.S.-China
military conflict The proposed]{.underline} security measures in a
[Framework Agreement would end the current military standoff over Taiwan

relations become acrimonious]{.underline}---as they typically do when
the Taiwanese political party favoring independence is in power or when
Chinese leaders play to nationalist public opinion and threaten a future
attack on the island---[it greatly heightens the security risks that the
U.S. faces in Asia]{.underline}. [In the event of an imminent or actual
attack on Taiwan]{.underline}, [the U.S. would almost certainly send
military forces to the island\'s aid]{.underline}, with proponents of
intervention [citing U.S. obligations under the Taiwan Relations
Act]{.underline}. National security strategists would argue that a
military response is essential to ensure the credibility of the overall
U.S. security posture in Asia, particularly the defense commitments to
Japan and South Korea. [The current standoff over Taiwan effectively
puts the U.S. at the mercy of political elements in China and Taiwan
that seek to achieve their goals without regard for U.S.
interests]{.underline}. [Those interests include both protecting Taiwan
and avoiding a war with China that could conceivably **escalate to a
nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. [By realizing a Framework Agreement
with China that protects Taiwan\'s democracy]{.underline}, [stabilizes
the region and **eliminates the risk of a U.S.-China conflict over

#### CP solves the case, Taiwan, and our disads -- BUT the plan and perm link

**Glaser**, professor of political science at George Washington
University and international affairs and director of the Elliott
School\'s Institute for Security and Conflict Studies, Spring **2015**

(Charles L., \"A U.S.-China Grand Bargain?\" *International Security*
Volume 39, Number 4, Project Muse)

U.S. accommodation of China deserves serious analysis for two reasons.
First, both intuition and international relations theory suggest that a
rising power, especially one that has experienced tremendous growth, can
reasonably expect to increase its geopolitical influence and more fully
achieve its goals, especially when these goals involve its national
security. [Bargaining theories maintain that the probability of war is
greater when there is a larger disparity between the distribution of
benefits in the existing territorial status quo and the balance of
power]{.underline}.3 Accommodation that reduces this disparity can,
under some conditions, reduce the probability of war and increase the
declining state's security. Second, the pressures created by the
international structure---the combination of material and information
conditions that constrain states' international options---should allow
China to rise peacefully, which, somewhat counterintuitively, increases
the potential importance of accommodation. If the international
structure were driving the United States and China toward a major
conflict, the concessions required of the United States would be
extremely large and costly. Even then, they might do little to moderate
the intense competition. But, because the international structure is not
creating such intense pressures, [concessions that do not compromise
vital U.S. interests may have the potential to greatly diminish growing
strains in U.S.-China relations]{.underline}, thereby [moderating future
military and foreign policy competition between the two
powers]{.underline}. More concretely, regional dangers dwarf
international structural dangers. [Northeast Asia is plagued by
territorial and maritime disputes that are straining political relations
both within the region and across the Pacific]{.underline}. **[Only one
of these disputes]{.underline}**---[China's opposition to U.S.
involvement in protecting Taiwan]{.underline}---[seems important enough
to]{.underline} possibly [bring the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and China into conflict]{.underline}. Even
Taiwan, however, is a secondary, albeit not insignificant, U.S.
interest. Other lesser disputes are currently roiling China's
relationships with many of its neighbors, but none appear sufficiently
significant \[End Page 50\] that they should derail China's peaceful
rise. Nevertheless, recent events demonstrate that even these seemingly
minor disputes---for example, over the status of the Senkaku/Diaoyu
Islands---can have an outsized negative impact on U.S.-China relations.
Thus, [the question arises whether accommodation on Taiwan]{.underline}
and possibly these still less important issues [would help keep China's
rise peaceful]{.underline}, [while the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [continued to effectively protect its vital
interests in the region]{.underline}. [Accommodation could bring risks
of its own]{.underline}. For example, [it would jeopardize U.S. security
if it were to convince China that the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**lacked the resolve** to protect its vital
national interests]{.underline}, **[leading China to adopt a more
assertive foreign policy]{.underline}**. This danger would be especially
large if, instead of limited aims, China desired regional hegemony and
was determined to force the United States out of East Asia.
[Accommodation might also raise **serious concerns among U.S.
allies**]{.underline}---[most importantly]{.underline},
[Japan]{.underline}---[about the reliability of U.S. security
guarantees]{.underline}, thereby **[undermining alliances]{.underline}**
that are widely judged to be essential to the security of the United
States. Finally, [ending the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[commitment to Taiwan could sacrifice important U.S. nonsecurity
interests]{.underline}, including support for democracy and individual
liberties, [with **no guarantee of benefits in return**]{.underline}.
[The grand bargain]{.underline} I propose [is designed to **capture the
benefits of U.S. accommodation with China**]{.underline}, **[while
reducing its risks]{.underline}**. [China's concessions]{.underline} on
its territorial and maritime disputes [would communicate information to
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [about the limited
extent of its aims]{.underline}, thereby [reducing Washington's concern
that its own concessions would encourage China to **push the
U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[out of East
Asia]{.underline}**. In addition, [resolution of these disputes would
**eliminate flash points** that fuel regional military competition and
crises that could **draw the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[into a war.]{.underline}**

[**China's willingness to reach an agreement**]{.underline} on the
offshore islands and related maritime disputes [would provide the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [with valuable
information]{.underline}. Most obviously, [it would demonstrate that
China's aims are limited]{.underline} (at least for now). Closely
related, [it would demonstrate]{.underline} a degree of [reasonableness
in Chinese foreign policy]{.underline} priorities and decisionmaking:
given that the value of Taiwan dwarfs the value of these maritime
disputes, [**Chinese unwillingness to reach this type of bargain** would
**indicate deep inflexibility** in its emerging foreign policy
and]{.underline} possibly **[overconfidence in its ability to
use]{.underline}** its growing **[power]{.underline}** [to
achieve]{.underline} all of [its aims]{.underline}. China's claims in
these disputes are also weaker than its claims to Taiwan: for example,
China did not claim the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands until 1970, which
suggests that it should be able to moderate this claim if the benefits
were sufficiently large. In addition, an agreement would provide the
United States with insights into the balance of power within China's
foreign policy decisionmaking. [If China's more assertive policies have
reflected the growing influence of]{.underline} the People's Liberation
Army, [narrow nationalist pressures]{.underline}, or both, then
[**Chinese concessions would demonstrate** that the country's leaders
could control these forces **when the stakes are sufficiently
large**.]{.underline} Taken as a whole, this information about China's
goals would make U.S. accommodation over Taiwan less risky.

In general, **[true balance-of-power environments can at least
potentially increase both risk taking and miscalculation]{.underline}**,
[especially if one or both sides conclude that they must confirm or
consolidate a perceived increase---or compensate for a perceived
decline---in leverage by acting more aggressively to test the resolve of
the other side,]{.underline} advance specific interests, or manage a
serious political-military crisis. [Avoiding or effectively controlling
such situations will require not only a variety of crisis management
mechanisms and]{.underline} confidence-building mechanisms ([CBMs)
beyond what have been developed thus far in Asia, but also high levels
of mutual strategic reassurance and restraint]{.underline}, involving
substantive and verifiable limits on each side's freedom of action or
ability to prevail militarily along China's sensitive maritime
periphery, as well as the maintenance of deterrent and shaping
capabilities in those areas that count most. [Many knowledgeable
observers have offered a variety of recommendations designed to reduce
mistrust and enhance cooperation between Washington and
Beijing,]{.underline} involving everything from caps on U.S. and Chinese
defense spending to mutual, limited concessions or understandings
regarding Taiwan and maritime disputes, and clearer, more calibrated
bottom-line statements on alliance commitments and core interests.3
While [many of these initiatives]{.underline} make eminent sense, they
[generally fail to address both the underlying problem of clashing
assumptions and beliefs about the requirements for continued order and
prosperity in Asia]{.underline} [and the basic threat perceptions
generated by inaccurate historical analogies about China's past and
domestic nationalist views and pressures.]{.underline} Moreover, [almost
no observers offer recommendations designed to significantly alter the
power structure in volatile areas along China's maritime
periphery]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} on the Korean Peninsula
and **[in and around Taiwan]{.underline}**, [in ways that could
significantly defuse those areas as sources of conflict over the long
term]{.underline}. In order to minimize the potential instabilities
inherent in a roughly equal balance-of-power environment, **[specific
actions must be taken to reduce the volatility of the most likely
sources of future U.S.-China crises and the propensity to test each
side's resolve, and to enhance the opportunities for meaningful
cooperation over the long term]{.underline}**. In particular,
[Washington and Beijing will need to reach reliable understandings
regarding the future long-term status of]{.underline} the Korean
Peninsula, [Taiwan,]{.underline} the management of maritime territorial
disputes, and the scope and function of U.S. (and other foreign)
military activities within the first island chain---or at the very least
within both China's and Japan's exclusive economic zones (EEZs). Such
understandings should almost certainly involve some credible form of
neutralization of these areas as locations from which to project U.S. or
Chinese power, or the creation of a stable U.S.-China balance of power
within them, thereby creating a de facto buffer zone along China's
maritime periphery. In the case of Korea, this implies the emergence of
a unified, nonaligned (or loosely aligned) peninsula free from foreign
military forces. This would require prior credible security assurances
by both the United States and China that a unified Korea would remain
free from coercion and always open to close economic and political
relations with both countries. Such assurances might involve a
continuation in some form of a greatly reduced security relationship
with Washington, at least in the short to medium term. This process
might also require Japan to provide security assurances to a unified
Korea, at least to the extent of agreeing to not acquire nuclear weapons
or some types of conventional weapons that Korea might find threatening,
such as precision ballistic and cruise missile strike capabilities. Of
course, none of this could happen as long as the Korean Peninsula
remains divided, with South Korea under threat of attack from North
Korea. Thus, ideally, the development of a stable balance of power in
the Western Pacific will require Korean unification sooner rather than
later. Failing that, a clear, credible understanding must be reached as
soon as possible among the powers concerned regarding the eventual
disposition of the Korea problem. [In the case of Taiwan, any credible
neutralization of the cross-strait issue as a threat to either side's
interests would require, as a first step, a U.S.-China understanding
regarding]{.underline} **[restrictions on U.S. arms sales in return for
certain types of verifiable limits on Chinese military production and
deployments relevant to the island, such as ballistic missiles and
strike aircraft]{.underline}**. **[Beijing would also likely need to
provide credible assurances that it would not use force against Taiwan
in any conceivable contingency short of an outright Taiwanese
declaration of de jure independence or the U.S. placement of forces on
the island]{.underline}**. [In the past, Beijing has resisted providing
assurances regarding any non-use of force toward the island, viewing
such an assurance as a limit on Chinese sovereignty over
Taiwan]{.underline}. [However, as in the case of Korea, Beijing would
likely view such a conditional limitation on its right to employ force
as acceptable if viewed as a requirement for the creation of an overall
stable balance of power in the Western Pacific]{.underline}; [Chinese
leaders might also regard it as a step toward the eventual unification
of the island with the mainland]{.underline}. [In addition, Beijing
would also likely need to accept: a) explicitly that such unification
could only occur on the basis of a peaceful process involving the
willing consent of the people of Taiwan, and b) tacitly that eventual
unification would likely not occur, if at all, for many
decades]{.underline}. For its part, **[the United States would likely
need to provide assurances to China that it would neither place forces
on the island nor provide any new level of defense assistance to Taipei,
as long as Beijing abides by its own assurances]{.underline}**. And both
countries would need to consult closely with Taiwan and Japan at each
step of this process and provide clear and credible assurances regarding
the understanding reached between them. Regarding territorial disputes
in the East China Sea and South China Sea, the United States needs to
make clear that it has little if any direct interest in the interactions
occurring between the disputants, beyond clear security threats leveled
against the two U.S. allies involved: Japan and the Philippines. While
supporting, in an even-handed manner, a binding code of conduct and
established legal procedures for resolving clashes and arbitrating
claims, Washington should avoid staking its credibility on ensuring that
a noncoercive process is followed in every instance. That said, it
should also make clear that it will oppose, forcefully if necessary, any
attempt to establish an exclusion zone or de facto territorial waters
beyond accepted 12-nautical-mile limits. For its part, Beijing must
clearly affirm, through its words and actions, that there is no military
solution to these disputes and that it will never seek to dislodge
rivals forcefully from occupied areas. It must also credibly and
convincingly state, privately if not publicly, that those waters in the
South China Sea located within its so-called nine-dashed line and
outside the territorial waters and EEZs of specified land features
constitute open ocean. Although doubtless difficult to achieve, such
understandings will likely become more possible in the larger context of
a neutralized first island chain as U.S.-China suspicions abate. In the
larger conventional military realm, U.S. military primacy within at
least the first island chain will need to be replaced by a genuinely
balanced force posture and accompanying military doctrine. This should
likely be centered on what is termed a "mutual denial" operational
concept in which both China and the United States along with its allies
possess sufficient levels of anti-access and area denial (A2/AD)--type
air, naval, missile, and space capabilities to make the risks and
dangers of attempting to achieve a sustained advantage through military
means over potentially volatile areas or zones clearly prohibitive. In
such an environment, neither side would have the clear capacity to
prevail in a conflict, but both sides would possess adequate defensive
capacities to deter or severely complicate an attack, for example, on
Taiwan, on the Chinese mainland, and against U.S./allied territory, or
any effort to close or control key strategic lines of communication
(SLOCs) in the Asia-Pacific. This will likely require agreed-upon
restraints on the production and/or deployment of certain types of
weapon systems operating in the Western Pacific, such as deep-strike
stealth aircraft, ballistic and cruise missiles, and deployed surface
and subsurface warships. On the nuclear level, a stable balance-of-power
environment in the Western Pacific requires a clear set of mutual
assurances designed to strengthen the deterrence capacity of each side's
nuclear arsenal and thereby reduce significantly the dangers of
escalation from a conventional crisis or conflict into a nuclear
confrontation. To attain this goal, American and allied defense analysts
need to discard the dangerous notion that U.S. primacy must extend to
the nuclear realm, via the establishment of a clear ability to
neutralize China's nuclear arsenal. Instead, Washington should
authoritatively indicate that it accepts and will not threaten China's
retaliatory nuclear strike capability. In other words, it must
unambiguously affirm the validity of a U.S.-China nuclear balance based
on a concept of mutual deterrence, something it has never done.
Moreover, to make this credible, Washington must abandon consideration
of a long-range, precision global strike system, or any other new type
of system capable of destroying China's nuclear arsenal through both
nuclear and conventional means, and provide greater assurances that its
ballistic missile defense capabilities cannot eliminate a Chinese second
strike. For its part, Beijing must be willing to accept such U.S.
assurances and eschew any attempt to transition beyond its existing
modest minimal deterrent, second-strike nuclear capability to a much
larger force. Obviously, [these sorts of changes will present major
implications for U.S. allies and friends in the region. Japan in
particular would play a major role]{.underline} in any effort to create
a stable U.S.-China balance of power in the Western Pacific. In order
for Tokyo to provide Seoul with the kind of assurances identified above,
and [to accept the above adjustments in the U.S.]{.underline} force
posture and [stance toward Taiwan, certain clear understandings with
Washington and Beijing would be necessary]{.underline}. In general, the
creation of a de facto buffer zone or a neutral/balanced area within the
first island chain would almost certainly require that Japan
significantly strengthen its defense capabilities, either autonomously
or, more preferably from the U.S. perspective, within the context of a
more robust yet still limited U.S.-Japan security alliance. In the
latter case, Tokyo would become a critical partner in the creation of
the sort of defensive, mutual denial operational concept. This would
entail the creation of a more fully integrated U.S.-Japan C4ISR
(command, control, communications, computers, intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance) infrastructure, stronger passive
defenses against possible Chinese ballistic and cruise missile threats
to U.S. and Japanese military assets, and enhanced Japanese logistics
and support facilities, alongside improvements in specific
defensive-oriented Japanese military capabilities, such as ASW
(antisubmarine warfare) and interceptor aircraft. However, this would
not require Japan to become a fully normalized security partner
alongside the United States, undertaking alliance-based security
activities across the Western Pacific and beyond. For China, acceptance
of a strengthened but still limited U.S.-Japan alliance, a unified,
largely nonaligned Korean Peninsula, verifiable limits on Chinese
capabilities vis-à-vis Taiwan, and the other elements of the stable
balance-of-power structure mentioned above would require a clear
willingness to forgo those more ambitious security objectives toward
which some Chinese might aspire, either now or in the future. These
include, most notably, the clear ability to establish control over the
waters and airspace along China's maritime periphery and a Sino-centric
Asian economic and political order that largely excludes the United
States. This will likely require, in turn, that Beijing make concerted,
public efforts to reject and invalidate among the Chinese citizenry
those more extreme interpretations of Chinese nationalism that call for
China to dominate Asia and to employ aggressive or violent means to
resolve various sovereignty and other disputes with its neighbors.
Although not mainstream at present, such notions nonetheless could
become more popular and influential as China's power grows (and if
Washington responds to such growth by seeking to sustain its past
predominance), and would in turn represent a clear threat to regional
stability. [The benefits for China of these accommodations would be an
enhanced level of security via a reduced U.S. threat to vital Chinese
interests and the avoidance of a costly and likely increasingly
dangerous security competition]{.underline}. These new circumstances
would also allow China to concentrate even more than at present on
establishing a stable and prosperous domestic environment. OBSTACLES TO
ESTABLISHING A STABLE BALANCE IN ASIA [Several obstacles stand in the
way of Washington and Beijing undertaking such a substantial
change]{.underline} in perceptions and practices, force deployments, and
power relations in the Western Pacific. On the U.S. side, first and
foremost is the general refusal of most if not all U.S. decisionmakers
and officials to contemplate an alternative to U.S. military
predominance in this vital region. Such maritime predominance has
arguably served Washington and most of the region well for many decades,
and it accords with the deep-seated notion of American exceptionalism,
which prescribes a dominant U.S. leadership role throughout the world.
In addition, the short-term perspective, natural inertia, and risk
avoidance of bureaucrats and policy communities in Washington (and
elsewhere) militate against major shifts in policy and approach,
especially in the absence of an urgent and palpable need for change.
Indeed, it is extremely difficult for any major power, much less a
superpower, to begin a fundamental strategic shift in anticipation of
diminished relative capabilities before that diminishment fully reveals
itself. In the Western Pacific in particular, with regard to both U.S.
ISR activities along the Chinese coast and the larger U.S. military
presence within the first island chain, the United States Navy and many
U.S. decisionmakers are wedded to the notion that American power (and in
particular naval power) must brook no limitation in areas beyond a
nation's 12-nautical-mile territorial waters and airspace. This derives
in part from the belief that any constraints on U.S. naval operations
will lead to a cascade of coastal states challenging the principle of
U.S. maritime freedom of action and to possible reductions in the level
of resources and the scope of operations available to support U.S. naval
power. Moreover, the specific U.S. desire to maintain a strong naval
presence along China's maritime periphery reflects a perceived need to
acquire more accurate intelligence regarding Beijing's growing offshore
air and naval capabilities. Such a presence is also viewed as essential
to sustaining U.S. credibility with Asian allies such as Japan and the
Philippines, and to the maintenance of deterrent capabilities against a
possible Chinese attack on Taiwan. This combination of service
interests, intelligence needs, and perceived security requirements
reinforces the general U.S. bias in favor of continued maritime
predominance. However, an inevitable Chinese refusal to accept that
predominance over the long term will be expressed first and foremost in
opposition to the past level of U.S. naval activities along the Chinese
coastline, that is, within China's EEZ at the very least, and possibly
within the entire first island chain. Second, and closely related to the
prior point, [U.S. decisionmakers are extremely loath to contemplate
significant adjustments in the current status of]{.underline} the Korean
Peninsula and [Taiwan.]{.underline} From the U.S. perspective, any
movement toward a reduction in or even a significant modification of the
U.S. security commitment to these two actors (a U.S military ally and a
de facto U.S. protectorate, respectively) could result in either moving
to acquire nuclear arms, and/or threats or attacks from North Korea or
China. In addition[, Japan might react to such movement by questioning
Washington's basic security commitment to Tokyo, which could result in a
break in the U.S.-Japan alliance and/or Japanese acquisition of nuclear
arms]{.underline}. [These concerns are]{.underline} real, if **[no doubt
exaggerated by some in Tokyo or Taipei in order to justify maintenance
of the existing U.S. relationship]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} in
some cases [to avoid undertaking costly defense improvements of their
own]{.underline}. On the Chinese side, perhaps the most significant
obstacle to undertaking a transition toward a stable balance of power in
Asia derives from the insecurities and weaknesses of the Chinese
government, both domestically and abroad. China's leaders rely, for
their legitimacy and support, not only on continued economic success and
rising living standards, but also on a form of nationalism that prizes
the ability of the regime to correct past injustices meted out by
"imperialist" powers during China's so-called "century of humiliation"
and to stand up to current slights, both real and imagined. Thus, their
policies often capitalize on the resentments felt by many Chinese
citizens toward the supposedly arrogant West and Japan. This viewpoint
makes the Chinese leadership hesitant to quell the more extreme forms of
nationalism described above and deeply suspicious of the United States
and its allies. It also makes it more receptive to the notion that a
rising yet still underdeveloped and relatively weak China must continue
to conceal its military capabilities while developing its overall
capacities to the maximum extent possible. In other words, the Chinese
regime is both excessively vulnerable to ultranationalist pressures and
disinclined to contemplate self-imposed limitations on its sovereign
rights (for example, with regard to Taiwan) and its political, economic,
and military abilities, especially in Asia. While this does not
translate into a drive for predominance, it does make Beijing less
willing to accept the kind of mutual restraints necessary to achieve a
stable balance of power in the Western Pacific. [NO GRAND BARGAIN, BUT A
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING AND **A STAGED PROCESS ARE REQUIRED**]{.underline}
These obstacles clearly indicate that **[Washington and Beijing are not
about to undertake, much less reach, a formal grand-bargain-type of
agreement to establish a new regional security environment anytime
soon]{.underline}**.4 S[uch a fundamental shift in policies and
approaches can only occur **gradually, in stages**, and over an extended
period of time]{.underline}. But it can only begin if elites in
Washington, Beijing, and other Asian capitals seriously examine the
enduring trends under way in Asia and accept the reality of the changing
power distribution and the need for more than just marginal adjustments
and assurances. Only then will they undertake a systematic examination
of the requirements of a stable balance of power over the long term,
involving a serious consideration of the more fundamental actions. [Such
an examination and acceptance must initially occur domestically, then
among allies and protectorates, and finally via a bilateral U.S.-China
strategic dialogue]{.underline} aimed at developing understandings about
the process and actions required. Such understandings must provide for
ample opportunities and means for both sides to assess and evaluate the
credibility and veracity of the actions of the other side. [If such
understandings can be reached]{.underline} regarding the overall need
for strategic adjustment, [then the specific concessions to minimize
potential instabilities and arrangements for meaningful cooperation,
involving]{.underline} Korea, [Taiwan]{.underline}, and maritime issues
within the first island chain, [will become much more
possible]{.underline}. In particular, a strategic understanding designed
to achieve a peaceful and stable transition to a genuine balance of
power in the Western Pacific could make Beijing more likely to pressure
or entice North Korea to abandon or place strong limits on its nuclear
weapons program and undertake the kind of opening up and reforms that
would almost certainly result eventually in a unified peninsula. While
difficult to envision at present, such a shift in Chinese policy is
certainly possible, given the obvious incentives to do so. While South
Korea might also resist movement toward a nonaligned status in a
post-unification environment, the obvious benefits that would result
from a stable balance of power, if presented properly, could very likely
overcome such resistance. [Regarding Taiwan, if both U.S. and Chinese
leaders can convince Taipei of the benefits of the kind of mutual
assurances and restraints necessary to neutralize the cross-strait
issue, **none of which require the U.S. abandonment of the
island**,]{.underline} **[these possible adverse outcomes of the
proposed or ongoing shift, including any resort to nuclear weapons,
would almost certainly be avoided]{.underline}**.

Third is **[the possibility of a cross-Strait peace
accord]{.underline}**. [Washington and Taipei should understand that
even if an accord would be difficult to negotiate]{.underline} and seems
unlikely now, **[it is not out of the question]{.underline}**. **[Taiwan
may decide that an accord is in its interest]{.underline}**. [If that is
the case, the two capitals should assume that at some point Beijing
would raise the issue of U.S. arms sales to and security cooperation
with Taipe]{.underline}i. That PRC scholar Sun Zhe suggested that [even
the discussion of]{.underline} [confidence-building measures would
require a credible declaration from Taiwan concerning this issue
indicates that it would certainly be on the agenda for a peace
accord]{.underline}. 63 To be sure, **[a PRC effort to limit Taiwan's
acquisition of capabilities without restraining its own would likely
make a draft agreement politically unacceptable on the
island]{.underline}**.Yet, given the possibility of cross-Strait
security negotiations, Taipei and Washington should be prepared to
discuss privately the many implications for their defense relationship.
Finally, [there have been some proposals that the United States should
rethink its arms sales policy altogether, either to promote positive
relations with China or to demilitarize what is deemed to be a political
dispute]{.underline}. [The most extensive recommendation comes from
Michael Swaine]{.underline} of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace. Essentially, [he believes that the United States is losing a race
over China concerning Taiwan's security]{.underline}.[As the PLA has
built capabilities relevant to a Taiwan conflict,Washington has
responded so far by providing Taipei with some advanced systems, urged
restraint on the PRC, and intensified surveillance activities and naval
and air deployments against China]{.underline}. The race could be
suspended if there were sufficient domestic consensus in Taiwan to reach
a political understanding with Beijing, but Swaine believes that is
unlikely. Rather, **[he argues, the relative shift in the balance of
resources and power between the United States and the PRC will place
Washington at a growing disadvantage]{.underline}**, **[and it will be
less able to resist opposition to future arms sales]{.underline}**.
**[Deterrence as it has existed will weaken, and Taiwan will become an
even more toxic issue in U.S.- China relations]{.underline}**. 64 In
order to stabilize cross-Strait security relations, Swaine proposes a
U.S.-China understanding: [Washington policymakers should consider
negotiating directly with Beijing,]{.underline} in consultation with
Taipei, **[a set of mutual assurances regarding PLA force levels and
deployments on the one hand, and major U.S. arms sales and defense
assistance to Taiwan on the other hand, that are linked to the opening
of a cross-Strait political dialogue]{.underline}**. 65

Collectively, these positions suggest [that China and Taiwan may be
prepared to defer the issue of Taiwan's status for resolution at some
point in the future. Both sides have expressed the desire to improve
relations, expand cross-strait contacts, and negotiate a peace agreement
between Taipei and Beijing]{.underline}. These goals were articulated in
the joint press communiqué issued following KMT Chairman Lien Chan's
April 2005 meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao.7 Hu Jintao
reiterated China's willingness to negotiate a peace agreement with
Taiwan in his statements at the October 2007 17th Party Congress: "On
the basis of the one-China principle, let us discuss a formal end to the
state of hostility between the two sides, reach a peace agreement,
construct a framework for peaceful development of cross-straits
relations, and thus usher in a new phase of peaceful development."8 Both
candidates in Taiwan's 2008 presidential election called for negotiation
of a peace agreement with Beijing, and President Ma repeated the call in
his inaugural address.9 Upon assuming ofªce, Ma moved quickly to restart
dialogue between [Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the
PRC's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the
semiofªcial bodies that previously served as vehicles for cross-strait
dialogue]{.underline}.10 **[Expressions of interest in negotiating a
peace agreement highlight the opportunity for signiªcant improvement in
cross-strait relations]{.underline}**, **[which would greatly reduce
tensions and decrease the likelihood of war.]{.underline}** Signiªcant
obstacles to a peace agreement remain, of course. [Recent discussions in
the PRC and Taiwan revealed considerable skepticism among ofªcials and
analysts about the likelihood of an agreement]{.underline} in the
immediate term.11 Leaders have expressed similar sentiments in the past,
with little results. Yet the policies articulated by President Ma
suggest that a signiªcant relaxation in cross-strait tensions is
possible, which could make progress on a peace agreement more feasible.
[The resumed SEF-ARATS negotiations have already yielded significant
agreements on direct transportation and cargo links, tourism, and food
safety. Understanding what a cross-strait peace agreement might look
like is helpful in envisioning future possibilities and in analyzing the
obstacles to an agreement and the political calculations and actions of
both sides]{.underline}. This article represents an initial step to lay
out potential parameters of a cross-strait agreement, and to consider
whether and how an agreement could be effective in reducing the
potential for armed conºict in the Taiwan Strait.12 [The primary
rationale for pursuing a peace agreement is to help stabilize the
situation across the Taiwan Strait---to reduce the likelihood of a
cross-strait military confrontation]{.underline}. Such a conºict would
impose heavy costs on both sides. For China, these costs include the
potential for a military conºict with the United States. The use of
force against Taiwan would also undo more than a decade of PRC efforts
to reassure neighbors that a stronger China does not threaten their
security.28 For Taiwan, a military conºict would likely leave the island
devastated and would potentially cut off economic relations with its
most important trading partner. Whether a peace agreement can be
effective in reducing the likelihood of such a confrontation is not
obvious. Leaders on one or both sides might view the costs of violating
the terms of an agreement as minimal, limiting its impact.
Alternatively, future trends in the PRC and Taiwan could undercut an
agreement's effectiveness over the long term, even if leaders originally
viewed defection as costly.29 If the PRC's economic and military
capabilities continue to grow rapidly, the use of military force to
"resolve" Taiwan's status might look more appealing to Beijing. Even if
both sides do abide by the terms of an agreement, assessing the extent
to which the agreement itself acted as a causal force driving such
behavior would prove difªcult. [PRC officials might sign a peace
agreement with Taiwan precisely because they have no intention of
attacking Taiwan absent a declaration of independence]{.underline}. [In
such a scenario, the peace agreement would reflect peaceful PRC
intentions and have little or no independent effect]{.underline}.30
Another consideration is that **[significant relaxation in cross-strait
tensions may be possible without an explicit peace
agreement]{.underline}**. [Some forms of increased cooperation and
cross-strait contacts can take place even without an
agreement]{.underline}. Although a peace agreement would not end the
risk of war across the Taiwan Strait, such [an agreement would likely be
more effective than mutual restraint]{.underline}. **[An explicit peace
agreement could produce additional beneªts that help to sustain
cooperation, include mechanisms that make it harder for either side to
walk away, and be more durable over time and across changes in political
leadership]{.underline}**. [A peace agreement could reduce the
likelihood of a cross-strait military con- ºict via several concrete
mechanisms]{.underline}. First, [formalizing an agreement could generate
audience costs that increase the penalty associated with belligerent
behavior by China or revisionist behavior on sovereignty issues by
Taiwan]{.underline}. Second**[, a highly formalized agreement could
create domestic institutional constraints on leaders seeking to violate
its terms]{.underline}**. Third, [an agreement could reduce uncertainty
by creating benchmarks for acceptable behavior and by facilitating the
credible signaling of intentions and resolve. Finally, an agreement
might produce or facilitate cross-strait cooperation that provides
valuable beneªts to actors on both sides and reduces the likelihood of
war]{.underline}. This last effect might foster a new dynamic in
relations, where small initial reductions in the probability of war give
rise to processes that have

Year after year, **[Taiwan is a top-14 trading partner for the United
States]{.underline}**. [Taiwan was America's seventh largest agriculture
export market]{.underline} in 2016 (\$3.2 billion) [and is also an
important market for U.S. machinery]{.underline} (\$5.4 billion),
[electrical machinery]{.underline} (\$5.2 billion),
[aircraft]{.underline} (\$3.2 billion), [and optical and medical
instruments]{.underline} (\$1.8 billion).3It occupies a key node in the
global supply chain, including for important American tech companies
like Apple and Micron. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company,
LTD ([TSMC]{.underline}) [supplies chips to companies such as Qualcomm,
Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices]{.underline}. Without Taiwan's
semiconductor and information and communication technology (ICT)
industries, [many of the world's most ubiquitous consumer electronics
would not exist or]{.underline}, perhaps, [would rely on
China's]{.underline} (People's Republic of China, PRC) [industry to the
detriment of the United States]{.underline}. Even so, when it comes to
Pompeo's second definition of "open"---particularly his emphasis on
"fair and reciprocal trade" and "open investment
environments"---**[Taiwan is not the regional leader it could
be]{.underline}**. To be sure, [Taiwan is more open than other large,
important Asian economies like China, Vietnam, Indonesia, India, and the
Philippines]{.underline}. In some ways, it is arguably more open than
Japan and South Korea. But [given its precarious position vis-à-vis
China and its relative diplomatic isolation, it behooves Taiwan to
outpace the rest of the pack, due both to the economic benefits that
would accrue to the island and to the **positive diplomatic and security
implications that would accompany Taiwan's embrace of regional
leadership on economic issues**]{.underline}. Taiwan should seek to set
the gold standard in economic openness, as well as in the legal,
regulatory, and standards frameworks that will govern emerging
technologies and industries such as 5G, the internet of things (IOT),
artificial intelligence (AI), and the future industries to be built upon
them. [A high-standards FTA with Taiwan]{.underline}, moreover, [would
provide a model for Southeast Asian countries that want to develop their
own high-tech economies]{.underline}. The [United States should make
clear that it sees a U.S.- Taiwan FTA as a roadmap for deepening
economic ties with Southeast Asian states and providing them a path
towards greater prosperity]{.underline}. The United States, meanwhile,
should seek to abet Taiwan in such an effort. [Deteriorating stability
in the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}, due largely to a dangerous
combination of hostility and inflexibility from Beijing, [threatens to
upend regional peace if balance is not restored]{.underline}. **[Closer
U.S.-Taiwan ties across the board, including in the economic
relationship, would contribute to righting that imbalance, dissuading
Beijing from further unsettling actions, and ensuring that this crucial
neck of the Indo-Pacific woods remains free]{.underline}**. The [U.S.
has a vital interest in cross-strait stability, and that can **only be
assured if the people of Taiwan believe they will not be overwhelmed
economically by Beijing**]{.underline}. An [FTA with the United States
would signal that Taiwan has many economic options, and open the door
for other countries to follow suit]{.underline}. Taiwan's current and
future political leaders would find that an FTA allowed them to engage
with Beijing, and with the broader international community, from a
position of greater strength. Moreover, closer bilateral coordination on
issues at the nexus of economics and national security could counter
specific threats to both countries and to regional order. [Bloomberg's
recent exposé on the Chinese government's successful tampering with
hardware to enable cyber espionage against end-users, including the U.S.
military, highlighted the dangers posed by China's prominent position in
global technology supply chains]{.underline}.4 Chinese attempts to set
industrial standards for 5G and otherwise monopolize the next generation
of mobile technology likewise pose a challenge to the United States, and
its allies and partners, on both economic and national security grounds.
[Taiwan may understand these issues better than any other U.S. partner,
and thus tackling them together is in the interests of
both]{.underline}.

Third, [it would be a mistake to conclude at this point that China is
actually critically weak at home]{.underline}, [hiding its fundamental
fragility behind a façade of authoritarianism and military
modernization, as some in the Trump administration reportedly
argue]{.underline}.97 The **[Chinese threat should be taken
seriously]{.underline}** and not provoked cavalierly. [China has
weaknesses, but over the past forty years Beijing has displayed
surprising resilience]{.underline}. No Chinese leader would survive
politically by failing to respond forcefully to perceived humiliation
over issues regarding Taiwan's ultimate sovereignty. [The stakes on this
issue are very high]{.underline}. An earlier tendency by the U.S.
government to underestimate opponents in North Korea and Vietnam, when
the United States was much stronger in relative terms, should give
Washington pause today. Fourth, [there may be **no better option** for
the United States with respect to Taiwan **than buying time to forestall
a conflict**]{.underline}. [This will seem a deeply unsatisfactory
prospect to Americans who like neatly delivered solutions]{.underline}.
Still, [this insight encourages Washington to counsel China and Taiwan
to exhibit restraint, avoid zero-sum options that force unnecessary
choices, and preferably work to establish a climate of reduced
tensions]{.underline} by encouraging the two sides to meet each other's
concerns. That is what neighbors with different interests but unchanging
geographic constraints need to do. The direction in which China is
headed offers no political appeal to the people of Taiwan, who enjoy
civil rights, political freedoms, and effective national autonomy. The
[erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy in recent years, after reunification
with the mainland, underscores these concerns]{.underline}. Moreover,
China's current combination of authoritarianism, economic modernization,
and globalization is deeply contradictory. [Something has to give as
China tries to be open and closed simultaneously]{.underline}. That is
preferably a matter for the people of China to decide for themselves
over time, not under the counterproductive pressure of outside parties.
**[The United States should maneuver for time by helping strengthen
Taiwan's economi]{.underline}**c and military **[fundamentals while
promoting the constructive values and norms]{.underline}** [that the
island illustrates and sidestepping unnecessary conflict]{.underline}.
This **[strategy offers at least a hope that Taiwan and mainland China
can work out their differences]{.underline}** if and when the gap
between their political systems narrows. In the meantime, [a free trade
agreement between Taiwan and the United States would be a good starting
point to boost Taiwan's economy and provide some international space
that China would deny it]{.underline}. If Washington were to retreat
from previous understandings with Beijing (the Three Joint Communiqués)
on how to manage Taiwan-related issues, [that would not help and would
very likely directly damage Taiwan's interests]{.underline}. When
U.S.-China tensions rise, Taiwan usually feels pressure from the
mainland, and Taipei, therefore, [should not want to inject itself into
the larger powers' bilateral disputes and draw greater attention from
Beijing]{.underline}.

[There are plenty of things the United States could do]{.underline}, and
ought to do, [to prevent further isolation of Taiwan]{.underline}.
Although [Washington]{.underline} has no right to tell other sovereign
states how to act on what they believe to be in their national (often
economic) interest---such as, in Panama's case, establishing diplomatic
relations with China---it [could certainly do more to counterbalance
Beijing's efforts to narrow democratic Taiwan's international
space]{.underline}. [Renewed leadership as part of a coalition of
likeminded democracies to ensure **Taiwan secures participation at
multilateral forums**]{.underline} (a battleground where Beijing has
scored several successes in the past year) [would not only be principled
but is also **essential to global security** and therefore very much in
everyone's interest]{.underline}. As China continues to whittle away at
Taiwan's visibility, [the United States]{.underline} and its democratic
allies [should increase the frequency and level of exchanges with
Taiwan]{.underline} (at the official and unofficial level) [to
demonstrate their commitment to the democratic nation]{.underline},
whose continued existence as a sovereign entity serves both as a source
of emulation for other states and a stabilizing force in the region: the
[abandonment of Taiwan]{.underline}, and subsequent annexation by China,
[would embolden revisionist forces in Beijing and likely prompt
rearmament from Taiwan's neighbor Japan]{.underline}. Serious
[**negotiations on a U.S.-Taiwan free-trade agreement** would mitigate
Taiwan's economic jitters, benefit various American businesses,
and]{.underline} conceivably [prompt other major economies to consider
similar agreements]{.underline}. Renewed commitment to the Taiwan
Relations Act and the Six Assurances, as well as stronger, bipartisan
signaling from Congress of American support for Taiwan, would also go a
long way in assuaging fears of abandonment in Taipei and limit the
psychological damage accruing from the loss of international space.
Regarding Taiwan's relationship with China, the loss of Panama, and
possibly that of a handful more in the lead-up to the Chinese Communist
Party's 19th Party Congress later this year, exemplifies Beijing's
determination to punish Taiwan for the choices it has arrived at
democratically. The [rigidity that undergirds such decisions highlights
both a policy failure on Beijing's part]{.underline}, which is at a loss
as to how to handle a consolidating Taiwanese nationalism, and suggests
a future of greater instability resulting from that inability to adapt
to and accept reality. Although Beijing blames the current impasse on
the Tsai Ing-wen administration and will do everything in its power to
undermine it, [subsequent administrations in Taiwan will now also be
propelled and constrained by the liberal-democratic forces that are now
fully entrenched in Taiwanese society]{.underline}. At some point,
[Beijing]{.underline} and the international community [will need to
acknowledge that a stubborn effort to turn Taiwan into something that
goes against its nature will only contribute to **greater instability
within the region**]{.underline}. [A final role for the United
States]{.underline}, therefore, [will be to make it clear that
intransigence---a **fixation on annexing Taiwan against its
will**]{.underline}---is the main source of instability, [not a people's
right to self-determination or elected leaders who make policy decisions
based on those imperatives]{.underline}.

UNION CITY, Calif.---[Taiwanese trade official **Chuang** Suo-Hang
**called for a new trade agreement between the United States and
Taiwan**]{.underline} in a speech at a banquet on March 30. The banquet
took place while James Francis Moriarty, chairman of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT), was visiting California. The AIT is the de
facto embassy of the United States in Taiwan. [Moriarty's visit to
California was an important part of a series of events celebrating the
40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act, which was signed into law
in April 1979]{.underline}. "**[Economic stability is national security;
economic stability is regional security]{.underline}**," said Chuang,
who is vice chairman of the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA), in his March 30 speech at the annual banquet held by the San
Francisco Bay Area Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce (SFBATCC). [Chuang said
that the Taiwanese government encourages Taiwanese businesses to invest
and to create jobs in the United States, and an agreement to secure
closer bilateral trading relations will serve the best interests of both
countries]{.underline}. "**[Stability in the Taiwan Strait is essential
to the goal of peace in the Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}**,"
Moriarty said at the banquet. He said that [a trade agreement could be
accomplished through Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement]{.underline} (TIFA) [negotiations by both sides]{.underline}.
TIFA is a program managed by the Office of the United States Trade
Representative. "[There is no better time to celebrate the U.S. and
Taiwan relationship than now, because this year marks the 40th
anniversary of passage of]{.underline} \[[the]{.underline}\] [Taiwan
Relations Act]{.underline}," said Joseph Ma, director-general of the San
Francisco Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, at the banquet. Ma said
[the Taiwan Relations Act has not only secured the relations between the
United States and Taiwan, but also "**functioned as a cornerstone in
maintaining peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific
region**."]{.underline} More than 400 Taiwanese business and community
leaders from California attended the SFBATCC's annual event. Defending
Democracy Moriarty's visit to California took place about two weeks
after the United States and Taiwan launched a joint platform called the
Indo-Pacific Democratic Governance Consultation. The [new platform aims
to defend the common values of freedom, democracy, and human rights
shared by the democratic countries in the region]{.underline}. The
Indo-Pacific region generally covers India, the United States, and major
Asian democracies in the region, especially Japan and Australia. Since
China became the world's second largest economy by GDP in 2010, [Asian
countries surrounding China have increasingly expressed concerns about
China's economic growth without a political system of checks and
balances]{.underline}. China started opening its doors to the world in
1979. Beijing's regime invited investments from the Western world to go
to China, mostly because China's 30-year practice of a centrally planned
socialist economy had come to the edge of collapse. In the 40 years
since China opened up to the West, [the world's democratic nations have
granted China many advantages when it came to trade and investment,
hoping China would eventually change for the better]{.underline}.
Widespread wishful thinking about changing China with investment from
the West included the hope that making China a WTO member would change
the regime. "We'll be able to export products \[to China\] without
exporting jobs," said President Bill Clinton on March 9, 2000, in a
speech on the China \[WTO\] Trade Bill at the Johns Hopkins University.
In the same speech, [Clinton]{.underline} also [predicted that letting
China join the WTO would bring peace and security to Asia and greater
prosperity to the United States]{.underline}. Clinton's predictions were
not unusual, but represented the optimistic views of many think tanks at
that time in the West. In 2015, China superseded Canada and became the
largest trading partner of the United States. The U.S. trade deficit to
China exceeded \$400 billion in 2018, based on statistics from the U.S.
Census Bureau. Marketwatch published a report in May 2018 titled "China
really is to blame for millions of lost U.S. manufacturing jobs, new
study finds." The report stated that there were "some 6 million lost
jobs from 1999 to 2010---one-third of all U.S. manufacturing
employment." **[China is Taiwan's largest trading
partner]{.underline}**. [Many people in Taiwanese society have felt a
clear and present economic and security threat from the Chinese
regime]{.underline}. In June 2013, [Taiwan's government signed the
Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement]{.underline} (CSSTA) [with
China]{.underline}. The agreement was criticized by some of Taiwan's
society leaders, who said it was "the last guinea pig" on trading with
China. The agreement provoked the Sunflower Movement, in which students
protested against the CSSTA by occupying Taiwan's congress for 24 days
from March 18 to April 10, 2014. As a result, the agreement has been
shelved ever since. [As China's economic power rose from being the tenth
largest in the world]{.underline} by GDP in 1979 [to being the second
largest]{.underline} in 2010, [the kinds of changes expected by the West
and Taiwan have seemed to be out of reach]{.underline}. Taiwan's cyber
security department revealed that some **[20 to 40 million cyberattacks
came from China in 2017]{.underline}**, and 360 of these attacks
succeeded. China's saber-rattling antics against its democratic neighbor
Taiwan reached an unprecedented level on March 31, when two Chinese
fighter jets intentionally crossed a maritime border separating China
and Taiwan. [China's economic growth has enabled the communist regime's
power to reach far beyond Taiwan and countries directly bordering
China]{.underline}. Stanford University recently published a report
summarizing China's penetration into American media, universities, think
tanks, politics, and other parts of American civil society. The 200-page
report, titled "Chinese Influence and American Interests," states in its
afterword: "[Once largely a form of economic competition, China's recent
turn to military and political rivalry with the United States has
changed the whole equation of the bilateral relationship]{.underline}."
While a democratic China is currently beyond reach, Taiwan and the
Western world have common interests in building stability and defending
their shared values in the Pacific region. "We have shown the world that
[democracy is a better path for any country]{.underline}," Chuang said
at the annual SFBATCC event. "**[We have never given up our
pursuit]{.underline}** \[**[of]{.underline}**\] **[freedom and
democracy, and we never will]{.underline}**." Chuang Encourages
Agreement Chuang also said in his speech that Taiwanese businesses
support 322,000 jobs in the United States, and that the [Trump
administration's corporate tax cut]{.underline} from 35 percent to 21
percent "[has made the U.S. an irresistible investment destination for
Taiwanese business]{.underline}." Chuang said that **[Taiwan wants to be
a responsible trading partner, following fair, free, and reciprocal
trade principles]{.underline}**. "**[Let's go forward with our united
strength. Let's sign a BTA]{.underline}** \[bilateral trade agreement\].
**[Let's connect]{.underline}** \[**[the]{.underline}**\] **[U.S.A. and
upgrade Taiwan]{.underline}**," he said.

#### Committing to Taiwan alleviates fears about decreasing arms sales and stops risky behavior

5\. [The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should signal
its continued unwavering commitment to preserving and promoting
extensive, close and friendly commercial, cultural and other relations
with Taiwan, including by enhancing senior-level exchanges with
Taiwan]{.underline} within the constraints of the United States'
one-China policy. [These actions would reassure Taiwan that any
incremental modifications of U.S. policy]{.underline} on arms sales,
such as that proposed in Rec - ommendation 4, [do not constitute a
weakening of U.S. commitment to its relationship with Taiwan. Such
reassurances would also have a stabilizing factor, as they would
dissuade Taiwan's leaders from undertaking potentially drastic measures
to ensure Taiwan's own security, which may then be
construed]{.underline}, right or wrongly, [by the mainland as attempts
to contravene the one-China policy]{.underline}.

#### FTA helps Taiwan decrease economic reliance on China\-\--AND, allows ASEAN nations to conclude trade deals, further helping Taiwan.

Likewise, [the United States has been careful to keep the focus of the
discussion about]{.underline} ECFA's [benefits to the direct bilateral
pay-off for Taiwan and China and not to countenance wishful thinking in
Taiwan that an ECFA with China would open a 'backdoor' to concluding a
FTA with the United States]{.underline}. In the waning years of the Bush
Administration, **[Taiwan pushed actively for entry into FTA
negotiations with the United States]{.underline}**. **[Taiwan's
strategic focus on a FTA with the United States was designed to offset
the marginalization continually forced upon it by Beijing]{.underline}**
[as China completed a flurry of trade deals with ASEAN and other trade
partners excluding Taiwan]{.underline}. [In Taipei's thinking, a trade
deal with the United States would not only bring some direct benefits to
its robust trading relationship with the United States, it would more
importantly provide cover for ASEAN and other potential trade agreements
to strike their own deals openly with Taiwan]{.underline}. From the U.S.
standpoint, however, existing obstacles must first be removed for there
to be any possibility of entering into negotiations for a U.S.-Taiwan
FTA. First, the United States has long required thresholds of progress
by Taiwan in the existing U.S.-Taiwan Trade and Investment Framework
(TIFA) talks as a precondition to considering a possible U.S.-Taiwan
FTA. Those thresholds have not yet been met with respect to certain
intellectual property right protections and various sector-specific
issues. More fundamentally, [the global economic crisis]{.underline} and
the transition in the United States to a new Democratic administration
in the executive branch [have added new uncertainties to the FTA roadmap
for Taiwan]{.underline}. Politically, President Barack Obama does not
yet have fast-track trade negotiating authority from Congress.
Economically, the global downturn has prompted closer scrutiny by the
U.S. government of all such trade deals.
