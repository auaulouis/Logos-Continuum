If dropping bombs won\'t work, what should the United States do to
obtain a peaceful relationship with the numerous hostile regimes,
including Iraq, that seek to harm us with terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction? The \"peace advocates\" offer no answer. The most one can
coax out of them are vague platitudes (we should \"make common cause
with the people of the world,\" says the prominent \"anti-war\" group
Not in Our Name) and agonized soul-searching (\"Why do they hate us?\").
The absence of a peacenik peace plan is no accident. [Pacifism
is]{.underline} **[inherently a negative doctrine\--it merely says that
military action is always bad.]{.underline}** As one San Francisco
protestor put the point: \"I don\'t think it\'s right for our government
to kill people.\" In practice, [this leaves the government only two
means of dealing with our enemies: **to ignore their acts of aggression,
or to appease them by capitulating to the aggressor\'s demands. We do
not need to predict or deduce the consequences of pacifism with regard
to terrorism and the nations that sponsor it, because we experienced
those consequences on September 11**]{.underline}. Pacifism practically
dictated the American response to terrorism for more than 23 years,
beginning with our government\'s response to the first major act of
Islamic terrorism against this country: when Iranian mobs held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days at the American embassy in Tehran. **[In
response to that and later terrorist atrocities, American Presidents
sought to avoid military action at all costs\--]{.underline}**by
treating terrorists as isolated criminals and thereby ignoring the role
of the governments that support them, or by offering diplomatic handouts
to terrorist states in hopes that they would want to be our friends.
[**With each pacifist response it became clearer that the most powerful
nation on Earth was a paper tiger**\--**and our enemies made the most
of** it. After years of American politicians acting like peaceniks,
Islamic terrorism had proliferated from a few gangs of thugs to a
worldwide scourge\--making possible the attacks of September
11]{.underline}. It is an obvious evasion of history and logic for the
advocates of pacifism to label themselves \"anti-war,\" since the
policies they advocate necessarily invite escalating acts of war against
anyone who practices them. [Military inaction sends the message to an
aggressor]{.underline}\--and to other, potential aggressors\--[that it
will benefit by attacking the United States. To whatever extent
\"anti-war\" protesters influence policy, they are not helping to
prevent war; **they are acting to make war more frequent and deadly**,
**by making our enemies more aggressive, more plentiful, and more
powerful**. The only way to deal with militant enemies is to show them
unequivocally that aggression against the United States will lead to
their destruction]{.underline}. The only means of imparting this lesson
is overwhelming military force\--enough to defeat and incapacitate the
enemy. Had we annihilated the Iranian regime 23 years ago, we could have
thwarted Islamic terrorism at the beginning, with far less cost than
will be required to defeat terrorism today. **[And if we fail to use our
military against state sponsors of terrorism today, imagine the
challenge we will face five years from now when Iraq and Iran possess
nuclear weapons and are ready to disseminate them to their terrorist
minions.]{.underline}** Yet such a world is the goal of the \"anti-war\"
movement. The suicidal stance of peaceniks is no innocent error or mere
overflow of youthful idealism. It is the product of a fundamentally
immoral commitment: [the commitment to ignore reality\--from the
historical evidence of the consequences of pacifism **to the very
existence of the violent threats that confront us today\--in favor of
the wish that laying down our arms will achieve peace
somehow.**]{.underline}

#### Strong military is key to defeat ISIS -- retreat or over-aggression makes all impacts inevitable

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will soon reach a
crossroads in its struggle against terrorism]{.underline}. The
international coalition fighting the Islamic State (also known as ISIS)
has driven the group out of much of the territory it once held and,
sooner or later, will militarily defeat it by destroying its core in
Iraq and Syria. But [military victory over ISIS will not end the global
war on terrorism that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
waged]{.underline} since 9/11. Some of ISIS\' provinces may outlive its
core. [Remnants of the caliphate may morph into an
insurgency]{.underline}. [Al Qaeda and its affiliates will still pose a
threat]{.underline}. Moreover, [the conditions that breed jihadist
organizations will likely persist across the greater Middle
East]{.underline}. So [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[must decide what strategy to pursue]{.underline} in the next stage of
the war on terrorism. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump called for
sweeping changes in U.S. counterterrorism strategy, promising to
\"defeat the ideology of radical Islamic terrorism.\" As president, he
faces a broad range of choices. At one extreme, [Washington could
abandon its military commitments]{.underline} in the greater Middle East
[on the assumption that it is U.S. interference]{.underline} that
[provokes terrorism]{.underline} in the first place. At the other, [it
could adopt a heavy-footprint surge strategy that would involve using
overwhelming military force to destroy globally capable terrorist
organizations]{.underline} and attempt to politically transform the
societies that produce them. [In between lie two options]{.underline}:
one, [a light-footprint approach]{.underline} akin to that taken by the
Obama administration before ISIS\' rise; [the other]{.underline}, [a
more robust approach closer to Washington\'s response to ISIS
since]{.underline} late [2014]{.underline}. None of these four
strategies is ideal. [The extreme options---disengagement and
surge---promise to dramatically reduce the threat. But both would likely
fail in costly ways, and both are politically untenable]{.underline}
today. [The middle choices pose less risk and are more politically
palatable. But]{.underline} they [also promise far less]{.underline} and
would likely leave the United States stuck in a protracted conflict.
[Trump must]{.underline} therefore [pick the best of a bad
lot]{.underline}. Despite his campaign rhetoric, [the]{.underline}
**[least worst choice]{.underline}** [would be a]{.underline}n approach
close to the **[medium-footprint strategy]{.underline}** being used [to
defeat ISIS]{.underline} today: [an aggressive campaign]{.underline}
encompassing air strikes, drone attacks, special operations raids,
[and]{.underline} [small]{.underline} **[deployments of regular ground
troops]{.underline}** in response to specific threats, all in support of
efforts by regional U.S. partners. [This approach]{.underline} is
imperfect, and it will not achieve decisive victory in a conflict that
shows few signs of ending soon. But it **[is the most likely
way]{.underline}** [of delivering]{.underline} an acceptable degree of
[security at an acceptable price]{.underline}. HOW TO FIGHT A HYDRA
Since 9/11, the U.S. government has proved remarkably proficient at
killing terrorists, frustrating their plans, and degrading their
organizations. Yet no sooner has Washington finished off one group than
a more dangerous one emerges. The United States gravely wounded al Qaeda
in Afghanistan in 2001--2 and the decade thereafter, only to be
confronted by the rise of al Qaeda in Iraq, al Qaeda in the Arabian
Peninsula (AQAP), and other potent affiliates of the group. The struggle
against those organizations was superseded in turn when ISIS---the most
virulent jihadist group yet---emerged on the scene. Even as the United
States has repeatedly achieved operational successes, enduring victory
in the war on terrorism has remained elusive. This problem again looms
large. [As of late 2016, ISIS had lost control of key
strongholds]{.underline}, such as Fallujah and Ramadi in Iraq and Manbij
and Jarabulus in Syria. Iraqi forces, supported by an international
coalition, were fighting to retake Mosul, and U.S.-backed militia groups
in Syria had begun operations to capture ISIS\' capital, Raqqa. The U.S.
Department of Defense has estimated that [since]{.underline} August
[2014]{.underline}, [the coalition has killed over]{.underline}
**[45,000 ISIS fighters]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} that [ISIS\'
combat proficiency, organizational cohesion, and morale have fallen
sharply]{.underline}. ISIS\' defeat is now only a matter of time. [But
the group\'s defeat will not end the war]{.underline} on terrorism.
[ISIS\' provinces]{.underline} in countries such as Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, Egypt, and Libya [may survive]{.underline}. [ISIS
fighters]{.underline} in Iraq and Syria [may return to their insurgent
roots]{.underline}. **[Al Shabab]{.underline}** in Somalia,
**[AQAP]{.underline}** in Yemen, and Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria [are not
going away either]{.underline}. Moreover, because [much of the Middle
East remains a fount of extremism, a successor to ISIS may
arise]{.underline} in Iraq, Syria, or somewhere else. The United States
will need a strategy for the next stage of its war on terrorism. JUST DO
NOTHING At one extreme, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[could]{.underline} exploit the opportunity provided by ISIS\' defeat to
[adopt a strategy]{.underline} favored by dovish critics: **[military
disengagement]{.underline}** from the greater Middle East. [This option
would represent a]{.underline} **[radical break]{.underline}** from
recent practice and a return to U.S. counterterrorism strategy of the
1990s and even before. That would mean [dramatically reducing U.S.
military presence]{.underline} in the greater Middle East, **[with no
combat troops]{.underline}** remaining beyond those needed to secure
U.S. embassies. Washington might still conduct a small number of
counterterrorism strikes, but these would be mostly retaliatory in
nature, such as the strikes on al Qaeda bases ordered by U.S. President
Bill Clinton in 1998 after the group bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania. Any preemptive attacks would be against only imminent
threats, and only with drones or other long-distance, limited-liability
methods of attack. Additionally, the United States would make no attempt
to create counterterrorism partners from scratch, as it did in
Afghanistan and Iraq, and would significantly reduce its existing
military cooperation on counterterrorism with countries such as Egypt
and Saudi Arabia. Disengagement would thus mean confronting terrorism
primarily through nonmilitary means. At home, the United States would
focus on intelligence and law enforcement. Abroad, it would focus on
sharing intelligence with other countries and securing diplomatic
cooperation on counterterrorism. Disengagement might involve some
limited development assistance to Middle Eastern countries, but U.S.
policy would not aim to fundamentally remake them. Put simply,
disengagement would take the United States off the war footing of the
past 15 years. The logic of disengagement is simple: U.S. military
involvement in the Muslim world cannot fix the problem of terrorism; in
fact, it exacerbates it by sowing anger at U.S. meddling. Pulling back
could therefore minimize the terrorist threat. At the least,
disengagement would remove a tempting target---the U.S. military---from
the terrorists\' backyard and reduce the blowback that occurs when U.S.
forces accidentally kill innocent people or act in other heavy-handed
ways. It would also deprive extremists of crucial propaganda material:
U.S. \"occupation\" of the Holy Land. More optimistically, it might
redirect the anger of militant Islamists away from the United States and
toward their own repressive governments and prevent more moderates from
radicalizing. Whatever terrorist threat remained, the argument runs,
could best be handled by learning to live with occasional small attacks
rather than by overreacting to them. Disengagement would mean, its
proponents claim, that the United States would save billions of dollars
annually by conducting fewer operations and marginally reducing the size
of its military. Yet [disengagement would]{.underline} also **[carry
severe liabilities]{.underline}**. [It would grant extremists
a]{.underline} **[powerful propaganda point]{.underline}**: [that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[will flee, not
fight]{.underline}**, when bloodied. Given Washington\'s traditional
role as the regional stabilizer, [disengagement could]{.underline} also
**[create a power vacuum]{.underline}** [in the Middle
East]{.underline}, perhaps [threatening states crucial to U.S.
interests]{.underline}, such as Saudi Arabia. Worst of all,
[disengagement would]{.underline} probably not actually [reduce the
terrorist threat]{.underline}. Although U.S. interventionism is one
source of jihadist fury, there are others, including the United States\'
liberal values and its nonmilitary support for repressive regimes, such
as those in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. And although inaction might mitigate
anti-U.S. blowback, [it]{.underline} [would]{.underline} also
**[prevent]{.underline}** [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[from disrupting incipient dangers]{.underline}---as happened before
9/11, when U.S. officials failed to deal with the growing threat posed
by al Qaeda. Disengagement, then, might not take the United States out
of the terrorists\' bull\'s-eye, but [it would deprive it of the tools
needed to keep the threat at bay]{.underline}. And if a less aggressive
posture contributed to a mass-casualty attack, leaders who had gambled
on disengagement would likely face political ruin. Given these
downsides, no U.S. president is likely to embrace disengagement. It is
telling that the Obama administration, despite showing some sympathy for
the logic of disengagement following Osama bin Laden\'s death in 2011,
ultimately concluded that the strategy was neither practical nor
politically viable. SOFTLY SOFTLY A post-ISIS strategy need not take
U.S. counterterrorism all the way back to the 1990s. [A]{.underline}
second, [light-footprint option]{.underline} would wind the clock back
only to the period from 2011 to 2014, after bin Laden\'s death but
before ISIS emerged as a major force. The logic behind this strategy
holds that the United States [can reduce terrorism to a tolerable level
by using limited military force]{.underline} to fight terrorist groups
capable of major attacks. [But it must not go too far, because outsiders
cannot fix the deep-seated political problems]{.underline} within the
Muslim world [that cause terrorism]{.underline}. So the United States
must avoid committing too many troops or resources; the risk of getting
stuck in a quagmire is as great as the risk of terrorism itself. In
practice, this strategy would entail sustained, preemptive military
efforts to weaken the most dangerous terrorist organizations, wherever
they may be. [Yet the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[would]{.underline} **[avoid even modest deployments of U.S. ground
forces]{.underline}** by [limiting itself to drone strikes]{.underline},
aerial attacks, and occasional raids by special operations forces.
[Where ground troops were]{.underline} n**[e]{.underline}**eded [to
contain the **most lethal terrorist organizations**]{.underline}---AQAP,
for instance, or al Shabab---Washington would rely on regional
governments to provide them, assisting with long-distance strikes and
logistical support. In all cases, regional partners would do the lion\'s
share of the work. The light-footprint strategy would thus aim to
manage, rather than defeat, what is considered a real but limited
threat, and do so as cheaply as possible. This approach would have its
virtues. It would use the United States\' unique military capabilities,
such as the ability to conduct long-range strikes, to keep pressure on
terrorist organizations without creating the blowback caused by larger
military interventions. It would also avoid stoking alarm at home,
keeping a threat that kills far fewer Americans than gun violence or
heart disease in perspective. Not least, although a light-footprint
strategy would cost more than disengagement, it would be cheaper than
the more aggressive options. It could therefore free up resources to
deal with other pressing problems, from climate change to resurgent
great-power rivalry. Given these advantages, it is unsurprising that
this approach appealed to the Obama administration after the end of the
Iraq war and bin Laden\'s death. As the Obama administration discovered,
however, a light footprint is no panacea. For one thing, [the strategy
means relying on unsavory local actors who are wont to do morally
appalling things. Nor does it even guarantee success]{.underline}. **[At
best]{.underline}**, [it would involve]{.underline} **[enormous
persistence]{.underline}** [merely to contain terrorist
organizations]{.underline} and avert disaster; the Israeli government
calls its version of the strategy \"mowing the grass,\" evoking a
Sisyphean task[. At worst, local partners, without more U.S.
support]{.underline} than this option entails, [might fail to contain
terrorist groups---something that has doomed the strategy in the
past]{.underline}. Between 2003 and 2011, for instance, Washington spent
considerable time and money building up the Iraqi security forces as a
counterterrorism partner---only to see them collapse after 2011, when
the United States withdrew its troops from Iraq. This allowed ISIS to
establish its quasi state, recruit foreign fighters, and direct and
inspire attacks. Something similar happened in Yemen. The
light-footprint approach worked well for a time against AQAP---so well
that in 2013 and 2014, the Obama administration touted it as a model for
counterterrorism. Yet by early 2015, the Yemeni state and armed forces
were crumbling before an externally supported Houthi rebellion, taking
down the U.S. counterterrorism mission in the process and allowing AQAP
to expand its hold in the country. The danger of a light-footprint
approach, then, is that it may incur some of the costs of action but not
do enough to keep the threat under control---and that when it fails, it
will require the United States to intervene under less favorable
circumstances than before, while also bringing down heavy criticism on
the leaders responsible. This is exactly what happened to the Obama
administration by 2014--15, causing it to shift to a more aggressive
strategy. THE GOLDILOCKS STRATEGY [The]{.underline} third---and probably
**[best]{.underline}**---[option is a]{.underline} **[beefed-up
version]{.underline}** [of the current strategy]{.underline}: call it
\"counter-ISIS plus.\" [It would involve a]{.underline} **[larger U.S.
military commitment]{.underline}** than the first two but substantially
less than a surge approach. At a minimum, the commitment would
approximate that of the Obama administration\'s 2016 counter-ISIS
campaign, which deployed roughly 5,000 U.S. troops to Iraq and Syria and
included thousands more conducting air strikes or other supporting
operations in the region. At a maximum, it would approach 20,000
military personnel, deployed to address specific threats from the
strongest terrorist organizations and to train and assist regional
forces. And crucially, **[this strategy would go beyond just deploying
more troops than a light-footprint approach: it would also allow them to
operate more assertively]{.underline}**. U.S. forces would still conduct
drone strikes and other long-distance, limited-liability attacks, but
these would form part of larger, more intensive air campaigns involving
manned aircraft, forward air controllers, and a broader range of
targets. Meanwhile, special operations forces would conduct a steady
rhythm of raids to gather intelligence, kill or capture terrorist
leaders, and disrupt terrorist organizations. And [battalion-size U.S.
forces would carry out combat operations on the ground, either
independently or in support of regional partners]{.underline}. These
might be similar to Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan in 2002, in which
over 1,000 U.S. troops and 1,000 Afghan militia forces, supported by
other coalition forces, engaged in a fierce battle against al Qaeda and
Taliban fighters. Finally, [U.S. troops would work with partner forces
not just by training and equipping them but also by advising them and
accompanying them into battle]{.underline}. These security force
assistance missions would continue even after the main campaigns had
ended to make sure partner forces remained effective. Under this
approach, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would still not
attempt to transform Middle Eastern societies]{.underline}, although it
would encourage local partners to make political and economic reforms to
defang jihadist ideology, and [it would use diplomacy]{.underline} and
modest economic investments to incentivize those reforms. In the
meantime, [Washington would seek to militarily defeat, rather than
merely contain, extremist organizations]{.underline}. And to do so, it
would accept the risk of more American casualties. This strategy rests
on a diagnosis similar to that underlying the light-footprint approach:
that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [cannot cure the
pathologies that cause terrorism]{.underline} and so will never
eliminate the threat. Yet this approach is more pessimistic about the
dangers of allowing extremist organizations to survive and more
optimistic about the chances of militarily defeating them. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can achieve
significant]{.underline}, if not **[permanent]{.underline}**, [military
success against terrorists]{.underline}, the thinking goes, [by
destroying their organizations, killing their leaders and foot soldiers,
and leaving them with no safe havens]{.underline}. Knock an opponent
down hard enough, in other words, and it will take him a while to get
back up. Indeed, the main advantage of [this strategy]{.underline} over
less aggressive options is that it [would pack a greater punch against
terrorist networks while still avoiding large, costly, and politically
toxic deployments]{.underline}. By combining a range of
tools---airpower, advisers, special operations forces, intelligence, and
diplomacy---[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could destroy
the most dangerous terrorist networks and prevent threats that are
manageable today from turning into something far deadlier
tomorrow]{.underline}. What\'s more, [providing more robust support to
partner forces would help maintain their effectiveness and give the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[greater
leverage]{.underline}** to moderate counterproductive behaviors such as
human rights violations and sectarian abuse, [which could help prevent
blowback]{.underline}. For example, the local forces with which the
United States has partnered to fight ISIS---the Iraqi security forces
and the Kurdish peshmerga in Iraq and Arab and Kurdish groups in
Syria---have performed better since the United States shifted to its
current strategy in late 2014. The experience of the past 15 years
suggests that this strategy can work against even fearsome opponents,
whether al Qaeda in Afghanistan in 2001--2 or ISIS today. Finally, by
striking a balance between doing too much and doing too little, this
option would mitigate the political risks of both more passive and more
aggressive strategies. Yet this strategy would also have downsides. It
would involve deploying between 5,000 and 20,000 troops at any one time.
Even limited deployments inevitably raise the chances of more American
deaths than planners expect. It would also mean spending \$5--\$20
billion per year---not a prohibitive sum, but far more than more passive
options would cost. The greatest danger of such a campaign is that it
might last indefinitely. Even in the best case, it would require a great
deal of time to succeed---witness the glacial pace of the counter-ISIS
campaign today. At worst, if terrorism is indeed rooted in the political
pathologies of many Muslim societies, then military victories may not
stay won unless those pathologies are cured---something that might take
more energy and resources than this strategy would provide. SWING A BIG
STICK This point leads to [the final option, a surge strategy. This
would entail a large, medium- to long-term military
deployment]{.underline} similar in size to the surge of 150,000--200,000
troops that the George W. Bush administration committed to the Iraq war
in 2007--8, along with proportional economic, diplomatic, and
intelligence resources. The United States would aim not only to destroy
the most dangerous terrorist organizations wherever they emerged but
also to remake the political complexion of the greater Middle East. Like
the second and third options, this strategy rests on the theory that
Middle Eastern terrorism flows from political illiberalism in the Muslim
world. But it assumes that the United States must cure the disease, not
merely treat its symptoms. Failing to do so, the argument goes, would
ensure that new terrorist groups would arise as old ones were defeated.
In a world of imperfect intelligence, allowing new threats to survive
risks exposing Americans to a catastrophic attack. This diagnosis
suggests a two-step response. First, destroy any terrorist organization
capable of global reach, using whatever means necessary, including major
military operations featuring tens of thousands of troops. Second,
transform the underlying sociopolitical dynamics that drive jihadist
ideology. Doing so would require catalyzing political liberalization in
the Islamic world, so the United States would have to engage in nation
building and democracy promotion in all countries where it had
intervened to root out terrorism. The allure of this option is that it
offers, in theory at least, the chance to win the war on terrorism once
and for all. This reflects a crucial insight from the Iraq war. Even if
U.S. officials blundered when they chose to invade Iraq, they made just
as grave a mistake in committing insufficient troops and resources to
Iraqi reconstruction and in pulling U.S. troops out so precipitously in
2011, which jeopardized U.S. soldiers\' hard-won gains. Since half
measures and premature withdrawal end only in long-term failure, the
logic goes, better to take a shot at winning decisively, despite the
extremely high cost. [Yet that cost]{.underline}---which must be borne
for many years---[is precisely the problem with this
strategy]{.underline}. Transforming the politics of the greater Middle
East in the ways the United States would want would be a huge challenge
under any circumstances. And without a shock the size of 9/11, even a
determined U.S. administration would probably lack the political will to
sustain the necessary level of spending and deployments---and suffer the
resulting casualties---over the long term. [The result might be the
worst of all worlds: the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would
invest vast resources up-front without the commitment necessary to see
the project through]{.underline}. This is not the only liability. **[A
surge risks distorting U.S. grand strategy by pouring resources into
counterterrorism at the expense of other vital issues, such as climate
change, the rise of China, and a revanchist Russia]{.underline}**.
What\'s more, putting more skin in the game might just encourage other
countries to free-ride on U.S. efforts. Finally, a strategy that relies
on large military interventions in the greater Middle East risks
provoking all the blowback that a lighter footprint would avoid.
Terrorists would attack U.S. forces, whose presence in the Middle East
would validate the jihadist narrative of a U.S. crusade against Muslims.
Whatever its attractions, then, a surge strategy would face daunting,
probably insurmountable obstacles. No wonder, then, that no major
candidate in the 2016 presidential race advocated anything close to this
option---and that Trump has explicitly taken this sort of nation
building off the table. STEADY AS SHE GOES The tragedy of the United
States\' war on terrorism is that it has no clean solution. Each of the
four main options for fighting terrorism has flaws, in some cases
crippling ones. But the United States must have a strategy. So which one
should it pick? U.S. officials should discard the two extremes,
disengagement and surge, on pragmatic grounds. Disengaging would bet the
house on an untested hypothesis---that pulling back would significantly
reduce the terrorist threat---which would leave the United States
terribly vulnerable if it proved false. Few prudent politicians would
hazard their careers on such a wager. The surge approach, for its part,
would be enormously difficult to execute, and because of its extremely
high cost, politicians would likely lack the stamina to stay the course.
That leaves the two middle-ground options: a light footprint and
counter-ISIS plus. Of these, the former has a lousy recent track record,
as ISIS emerged and the United States\' position deteriorated
dramatically the last time this strategy dominated U.S. policy.
Employing it would risk starting a cycle in which a U.S. pullback causes
the threat to increase, compelling the United States to intervene again
under worse circumstances than before. The strategy thus also occupies a
precarious political footing: it would probably not survive a repetition
of the type of attacks that occurred in late 2015 and 2016, when
ISIS-inspired shooters killed 63 people in San Bernardino and Orlando.
So the last strategy standing is [counter-ISIS plus]{.underline}. True,
it [has real problems and risks]{.underline} doing no more than failing
at greater expense than the light-footprint approach. [But it succeeded
both when]{.underline} the [Bush]{.underline} administration
[and]{.underline} when the [Obama]{.underline} administration [employed
it aggressively]{.underline}, [and it]{.underline} [could]{.underline}
well **[eliminate the worst aspect of the terrorist
threat]{.underline}**---the existence of breeding grounds for
mass-casualty attacks---[if pursued]{.underline} consistently. [The cost
of doing so would hardly be trivial, but a wealthy superpower could
manage it]{.underline}. Additionally, although this approach would
probably not produce exceptional performance from U.S. partners, it
might help them do well enough to limit U.S. costs over the long run.
Finally, despite Trump\'s harsh critiques of the Obama administration\'s
campaign against ISIS, this approach is probably the most politically
salable. The Trump administration should thus take this variant of the
strategy that the Obama administration had built up to by 2016 as its
guide. It is not perfect and will not end the war on terrorism anytime
soon. But it may give the United States a minimally acceptable level of
security in a dangerous struggle.

[If those powers cannot contain a potential hegemon on their own,
however, **the United States must help get the job done, deploying
enough firepower to the region to shift the balance in its
favor**]{.underline}. Sometimes, that may mean sending in forces before
war breaks out. During the Cold War, for example, the United States kept
large numbers of ground and air forces in Europe out of the belief that
Western European countries could not contain the Soviet Union on their
own. [At other times, the United States might wait to intervene after a
war starts, if one side seems likely to emerge as a regional
hegemon.]{.underline} Such was the case during both world wars: [the
United States came in only after Germany seemed likely to dominate
Europe. In essence, the aim is to remain offshore as long as possible,
while recognizing that it is sometimes necessary to come onshore. If
that happens, however, the United States should make its allies do as
much of the heavy lifting as possible and remove its own forces as soon
as it can.]{.underline} Offshore balancing has many virtues. [By
limiting the areas the U.S. military was committed to defending and
forcing other states to pull their own weight, it would reduce the
resources Washington]{.underline} must devote to defense, allow for
greater investment and consumption at home, and put fewer American lives
in harm's way. [**Today, allies routinely free-ride on American
protection**, a problem that has only grown since the Cold War
ended]{.underline}. Within nato, for example, the United States accounts

worth remembering that Osama bin Laden was motivated in good part by the
presence of U.S. troops in his homeland of Saudi Arabia.) [In addition
to inspiring terrorists, liberal hegemony facilitates their operations:
using regime change to spread American values undermines local
institutions and creates ungoverned spaces where violent extremists can
flourish. **Offshore balancing would alleviate this problem by eschewing
social engineering and minimizing the United States' military
footprint.**]{.underline} U.[S. troops would be stationed on foreign
soil only when a country was in a vital region and threatened by a
would-be hegemon.]{.underline} In that case, the potential victim would
view the United States as a savior rather than an occupier. And once the
threat had been dealt with, U.S. military forces could go back over the
horizon and not stay behind to meddle in local politics. By respecting
the sovereignty of other states, offshore balancing would be less likely
to foster antiAmerican terrorism.

### Heg Stops Conflict

#### US militarism solves great power war through deterrence

(Robert, \"The twilight of the liberal world order,\" *Brookings*,

https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-twilight-of-the-liberal-world-order/)

However, it is the two great powers, [China and Russia]{.underline},
that [pose the **greatest challenge**]{.underline} [to the relatively
peaceful and prosperous international order created and sustained by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [If they]{.underline} were to
[accomplish]{.underline} their aims of establishing hegemony in their
desired [spheres of influence, the world would return to]{.underline}
the condition it was in at the end of the 19th century, with
[**competing great powers** clashing over inevitably intersecting and
overlapping spheres of interest]{.underline}. These were the unsettled,
disordered conditions that produced the fertile ground for the two
destructive world wars of the first half of the 20th century. The
collapse of the British-dominated world order on the oceans, the
disruption of the uneasy balance of power on the European continent due
to the rise of a powerful unified Germany, combined with the rise of
Japanese power in East Asia all contributed to a highly competitive
international environment in which dissatisfied great powers took the
opportunity to pursue their ambitions in the absence of any power or
group of powers to unite in checking them. [The result was an
**unprecedented global calamity**]{.underline}. It has been the great
accomplishment of the U.S.-led world order in the 70 years since the end
of the Second World War that [this kind of competition has been held in
check and great power conflicts have been avoided]{.underline}.

[The role of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, however, [has
been **critical**]{.underline}. Until recently, the dissatisfied
[great]{.underline} and medium-size [powers]{.underline} have [faced
considerable and]{.underline} indeed almost [insuperable obstacles to
achieving their objectives]{.underline}. The chief obstacle has been the
power and coherence of the order itself and of its principal promoter
and defender. [The American-led system]{.underline} of political and
military alliances, especially [in]{.underline} the two critical regions
of [Europe and East Asia]{.underline}, has [presented China and Russia
with]{.underline} what Dean Acheson once referred to as "[situations of
strength]{.underline}" in their regions that have required them to
pursue their ambitions cautiously and in most respects to defer serious
efforts to disrupt the international system. [The system has served as a
**check on their ambitions**]{.underline} [in both positive and negative
ways]{.underline}. [They have been participants in]{.underline} and for
the most part beneficiaries of [the open international economic
system]{.underline} the United States created and helped sustain and, so
long as that system was functioning, have had more to gain by playing in
it than by challenging and overturning it. The same cannot be said of
the political and strategic aspects of the order, both of which have
worked to their detriment. The growth and vibrancy of democratic
government in the two decades following the collapse of Soviet communism
have posed a continual threat to the ability of rulers in Beijing and
Moscow to maintain control, and since the end of the Cold War they have
regarded every advance of democratic institutions, including especially
the geographical advance close to their borders, as an existential
threat---and with reason. [The continual threat to the basis of their
rule posed by the U.S.-supported order has made them hostile both to the
order and to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
[However]{.underline}, [it has also been a source of **weakness** and
**vulnerability**]{.underline}. [Chinese rulers]{.underline} in
particular [have]{.underline} had [to worry about]{.underline} what an
[unsuccessful confrontation with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates might do to their sources of legitimacy at home.
And although Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} has to some extent used a
calculated foreign adventurism to maintain his hold on domestic power,
he [has taken a **more cautious approach**]{.underline} when met with
determined U.S. and European opposition, as in the case of Ukraine, and
pushed forward, as in Syria, only when invited to do so by U.S. and
Western passivity. [Autocratic rulers in a liberal democratic world have
had to be careful.]{.underline}

[The greatest check on Chinese and Russian ambitions]{.underline},
however, [has come from]{.underline} the combined [military power of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies in Europe and
Asia]{.underline}. [China]{.underline}, although increasingly powerful
itself, has had to [contemplate]{.underline} [facing]{.underline} the
[combined military strength of]{.underline} the world's superpower and
some very formidable regional powers linked by alliance or common
strategic interest, including [Japan]{.underline}, [India]{.underline},
[and South Korea]{.underline}, as well as smaller but still potent
nations like [Vietnam]{.underline} [and Australia]{.underline}. [Russia
has had to face the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and]{.underline} its [NATO allies]{.underline}. When united, [these
military powers present a **daunting challenge**]{.underline} [to a
revisionist power that can call on no allies of its own for
assistance]{.underline}. Even were the Chinese to score an early victory
in a conflict, they would have to contend over time with the combined
industrial productive capacities of some of the world's richest and most
technologically advanced nations. [A weaker Russia would face an even
greater challenge]{.underline}.

Faced with these obstacles, the two great powers, as well as the lesser
dissatisfied powers, have had to hope for or if possible engineer a
weakening of the U.S.-supported world order from within. This could come
about either by separating the United States from its allies, raising
doubts about the U.S. commitment to defend its allies militarily in the
event of a conflict, or by various means wooing American allies out from
within the liberal world order's strategic structure. For most of the
past decade, [the reaction of American allies to **greater
aggressiveness** on the part of China and Russia in their respective
regions, and to Iran in the Middle East, has been to seek **more
reassurance** from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
[Russian actions in Georgia]{.underline}, [Ukraine]{.underline}, and
[Syria]{.underline}; [Chinese actions in the East and South China
seas]{.underline}; [Iranian actions in Syria, Iraq, and]{.underline}
along the littoral of the [Persian Gulf]{.underline}---all have [led to
calls by American allies and partners for a greater
commitment]{.underline}. In this respect, the system has worked as it
was supposed to. What the political scientist William Wohlforth once
described as the inherent stability of the unipolar order reflected this
dynamic---as dissatisfied regional powers sought to challenge the status
quo, their [alarmed neighbors turned to the distant American superpower
to contain their ambitions]{.underline}.

[The next U.S. president will inherit a security environment in which
the United States con­fronts]{.underline} [mounting threats]{.underline}
[with increasingly constrained resources]{.underline}, [diminished
stature, and **growing uncertainty**]{.underline} both at home and
abroad over its willingness to protect its friends and its interests.
Revisionist powers in Europe, the western Pacific, and the Persian
Gulf---[three regions]{.underline} long considered by both Democratic
and Republican administrations to be vital to U.S. national
security---[are seeking to overturn the rules-based international
order]{.underline}. In Europe, Russian President Vladimir [Putin has
seized Crimea]{.underline}, [waged **proxy warfare**]{.underline} [in
eastern]{.underline} [Ukraine]{.underline}, an[d threatened NATO allies
on Russia's periphery]{.underline}. Further [demonstrating]{.underline}
its **[newfound assertiveness]{.underline}**, [Russia has dispatched
forces to Syria and strength­ened its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. After
a failed attempt to "reset" relations with Moscow, U.S. President Barack
[Obama]{.underline} has [issued stern warnings and imposed economic
sanctions, but these have **done little to deter Putin**]{.underline}.

Nor has the administration's "pivot" to Asia, now five years on, been
matched by effective action. China continues to ramp up its military
spending, investing heavily in weapons systems designed to threaten U.S.
forces in the western Pacific. As a result, [it is proving increas­ingly
willing and able to advance its **expansive territorial
claims**]{.underline} [in the East China and South China
Seas]{.underline}. Not content to resolve its disputes through
diplomacy, [Beijing has militarized them]{.underline}, [building bases
on natural and artificially created islands]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has [failed to respond
vigorously to these provocations]{.underline}, [causing allies to
**question** its willingness to meet its long-standing security
commitments]{.underline}.

The [lack of U.S. leadership is]{.underline} also **[fueling
instability]{.underline}** [in the Middle East]{.underline}. In Iraq,
the Obama administration forfeited hard-won gains by withdrawing all
U.S. forces, creating a security vacuum that enabled the rise of both
Iranian influence and the Islamic State, or ISIS. Adding to its
strategic missteps, [the administration]{.underline} fundamentally
**[misread]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} character of the [Arab
Spring]{.underline}, [failing to appreciate that]{.underline} the
[uprisings would provide opportunities for radical Islamist elements
rather than lead to a new democratic order]{.underline}. The
administration also failed to learn from the previous administration's
experience in Iraq when it chose to "lead from behind" in Libya,
intervening to over­throw Muammar al-Qaddafi, only to declare victory and
abandon the country to internal disorder. [It]{.underline} then [drew
a]{.underline} "[redline]{.underline}" [over]{.underline} President
Bashar al-[Assad's]{.underline} [use of chemical weapons]{.underline} in
Syria [but]{.underline} **[failed to act to enforce it]{.underline}**.
[The result is **growing instability**]{.underline} i[n the Middle East
and a decline in U.S. influence]{.underline}.

The [threat of Islamist terrorism has grown]{.underline} on the Obama
administration's watch. A[l Qaeda and ISIS]{.underline}, both Sunni
groups, have [gained new footholds in Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen, and
even West Africa]{.underline}. [Obama's negotiations with
Iran]{.underline}, the home of radical Shiite Islamism, [have not
curbed]{.underline} the country's involvement in [proxy wars in Iraq,
Syria, and Yemen or its support for Hezbollah]{.underline} in Lebanon
and Hamas in the Palestinian territories. What the talks did
produce---[the nuclear deal]{.underline}---[may slow Tehran's march to
ob­taining a nuclear weapon]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} it also
[gives the regime access to tens of billions of dollars]{.underline} in
formerly frozen assets. The ink on the agreement was barely dry when, in
March, Tehran tested ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear
warhead, in blatant defiance of a UN Security Council resolution.
[Adding to all this instability]{.underline}, **[military
competition]{.underline}** has [expanded]{.underline} [into]{.underline}
the relatively [new domains of **outer space** and
**cyberspace**]{.underline}---[and will eventually]{.underline} [extend
to undersea economic infrastructure]{.underline}, as well.

[With the current approach failing]{.underline}, [the next president
will need to formulate a new defense strategy]{.underline}. It should
include three basic elements: a clear statement of what the United
States seeks to achieve, an understanding of the resources available for
those goals, and guidance as to how those resources will be used. [The
strategy]{.underline} laid out here, if properly implemented, [will
allow the United States to preclude the rise of a hegemonic power along
the Eurasian periphery and **preserve access to the global
commons**]{.underline}---[without bankrupting the country in the
process]{.underline}.

[American retrenchment could have devastating consequences. Without an
American security blanket, regional powers could rearm in an attempt to
balance against emerging threats. **Under this scenario, there would be
a heightened possibility of arms races, miscalculation, or other crises
spiraling into all-out conflict**. Alternatively, in seeking to
accommodate the stronger powers, **weaker powers may shift their
geopolitical posture away from the United States**. Either way,
**hostile states would be emboldened to make aggressive moves** in their
regions. As rival powers rise, Asia in particular is likely to emerge as
a zone of great-power competition. Beijing's economic rise has enabled a
dramatic military buildup focused on acquisitions of naval, cruise, and
ballistic missiles, long-range stealth aircraft, and anti-satellite
capabilities. China's strategic modernization is aimed, ultimately, at
denying the United States access to the seas around China. Even as
cooperative economic ties in the region have grown, China's expansive
territorial claims --- and provocative statements and actions following
crises in Korea and incidents at sea --- have roiled its relations with
South Korea, Japan, India, and Southeast Asian states. Still, the United
States is the most significant barrier facing Chinese hegemony and
aggression.]{.underline}

Appearance of Reduced Ability to Deter Aggression

As noted, U.S. involvement in the Middle East has often come in response
to threats to global peace and security from aggressive actors, such as
Saddam Hussein and the Islamic Republic of Iran. [Sensing reduced U.S.
involvement]{.underline}, [those seeking to increase their power in the
region may decide they can **intensify destabilizing
activities**]{.underline}. In particular, [hardliners in Iran may
successfully push for the Islamic Republic to be **more
aggressive**]{.underline}---[to more actively fund militias and
terrorists]{.underline} or to more openly threaten naked force (e.g., in
Gulf waters). The challenge for U.S. policy will be to find ways to
effectively deter such steps. Although the threat posed by states
willing to destabilize the region has been magnified by their oil
income, [carrying out their troubling plans is not necessarily very
expensive compared to the amounts they earn]{.underline}. Therefore, a
**[reduction in oil earnings]{.underline}**---as implied by some
possible scenarios in which U.S. oil production rises sharply---**[will
do little to reduce the risk of aggression in the Middle
East]{.underline}**. In fact, [the threat of external aggression has
been]{.underline} as high or [higher during periods of low oil
prices]{.underline} as during periods of high oil prices. While low oil
prices may crimp such states' resources, those [prices]{.underline} may
[redouble]{.underline} their [determination to assert themselves
aggressively]{.underline}. Certainly, Saddam Hussein explained his
invasion of Kuwait as a response to what he saw as unacceptably low
Iraqi oil income. He complained that the Gulf states were not being
forthcoming: Kuwait was stealing oil from fields on the border with
Iraq, the Gulf states overall were not reducing their output in a way
that prompted higher prices and accommodated greater Iraqi production,
and these states were not helping Iraq recover from the Iran-Iraq War,
which Saddam felt served to defend them as well as Iraq. While the
prospect now seems distant, U.S. policymakers should make clear that any
aggression in pursuit of larger oil income would be met with the same
vigorous, determined U.S. response that countered Saddam's invasion of
Kuwait. In addition, Washington should assess how key players may seek
to limit damage to their interests, given a changed world energy
situation. For example, if a glut of global oil production leads to a
sharp drop in prices, in what way might Russia, Iran, or Saudi Arabia
"export instability" as a way to prop up prices artificially? Such a
scenario seems more likely than open aggression. To the extent that the
U.S. worry is about instability, such a concern may well not diminish if
the world moves toward less reliance on Middle East oil, and it may
grow. Much the same is true regarding WMD proliferation. [While WMD
programs are expensive, the sums required are well within reach for
determined proliferators]{.underline}. [No conceivable reduction in oil
income will change that calculus]{.underline} for any of the region's
many potential proliferators. **[Decisions about proliferation will be
based on strategic calculations]{.underline}**. The risk is that [if the
United States]{.underline}---and arguably Europe, traditionally its
principal partner in pressing for nonproliferation---[is seen as less
involved in the Middle East, a potential proliferator may conclude that
the Great Powers will care less]{.underline}, at least about borderline
activities that do not cross the proliferation threshold. [If the United
States is seen as a less reliable guarantor of security]{.underline},
some [countries in Iran's neighborhood may **feel they need to match the
extensive Iranian nuclear capabilities**]{.underline} the 2015 agreement
authorizes after about a decade's delay. [The United States draws great
advantage from its role as global guarantor of freedom of
navigation]{.underline}, [including in the Middle East]{.underline}, but
this role effectively provides a security guarantee that benefits others
as well as the United States. As the U.S.-guaranteed free flow of oil
from the Middle East becomes of less direct benefit to the U.S. economy
and of increasing importance to Asia, Americans will ask tough questions
about sharing the defense burden. Among the chief beneficiaries of that
free flow of Gulf oil is China, which creates a quandary for the United
States because China may become even more of a strategic competitor with
the United States than it is at present. The obvious temptation is to
ask why China cannot bear more of the Middle East defense burden. And
the corresponding challenge for U.S. policymakers will be to make the
case that [the United States would be ill-advised to encourage China to
develop a **global power-projection capability**]{.underline}, which
China might well use for narrow self-interest rather than to protect the
global commons and global stability. [It is not in the U.S. interest for
China to become a global competitor militarily as well as
economically]{.underline}, [with a military able to contest U.S. power
and influence far from home]{.underline}, in part [because China may not
be a responsible defender]{.underline} of access to the sea-lanes of
communication for all rather than just for itself. Similarly, [it is not
in the U.S. interest for Russia to project its military power across the
Middle East]{.underline}, [because]{.underline} [that would
encourage]{.underline} those in Russia who dream of returning to the
days of U.S.-Soviet rivalry, with all the attendant risks of **[global
thermonuclear war]{.underline}**. On protecting the free flow of oil,
the quick summary case for the United States to continue bearing this
burden is "If we don't do it, someone else will develop the capabilities
to do so---and we may regret what they do with that power." Need to
Reassure Friends Those concluding, based on reduced U.S. reliance on
Middle East oil, that the United States is retreating from an active
regional stance may include not only those actors contemplating
aggressive moves but also U.S. friends. [Such a development could
**undermine U.S. influence** in the Middle East]{.underline}, making it
harder for Washington to accomplish any objectives at all. Strong
U.S.-Saudi ties are based in part on America's status as the world's
largest oil consumer and Saudi Arabia's as one of the top three global
producers. If that strategic rationale fades, ties may wither between
two very different countries with very different values, possibly
endangering their cooperation on important strategic issues such as
opposition to radicalism and Iranian aggression. If they perceive the
United States as less of a player, the Saudis and other regional states
may act in ways to which Washington objects. [The greatest]{.underline}
and most obvious [challenge posed by]{.underline} a [U.S.
retreat]{.underline}, as discussed, [is how to deter hostile powers from
increasing their destabilizing activities]{.underline}. Yet the image of
a withdrawing United States may also cause friends to pay less attention
to U.S. concerns. Washington has had only indifferent success at urging
Middle East states to act in their own long-term interest, be it to
reform their economies, open up their societies and politics, or settle
the ArabIsraeli conflict. [U.S. leverage to promote]{.underline} such
[causes]{.underline} [will]{.underline} **[diminish
further]{.underline}**, however, [if these countries think the United
States is **less committed** to protecting their security]{.underline}.
[If regional states feel the United States does not have their back,
they may decide to act on their own to address security
concerns]{.underline}, possibly in ways Washington finds dubious or even
counterpro ductive. The current Yemen war may presage what is to come:
Gulf states deciding on their own that they must assemble a coalition to
act vigorously and then exploring what the United States may or may not
be prepared to do to help them---with the subtext that if U.S. support
is not forthcoming, the Gulf states will proceed on their own.
Washington has made clear its lack of enthusiasm for the Yemen
war---indeed, its unhappiness with some of the ways the war has been
fought---but such objections have barely, if at all, affected the Gulf
states' actions. The result is that the United States has been relegated
to the sidelines of the war. Much as an increasingly aloof U.S. attitude
may lead the Gulf states to act more independently, the impact of the
new oil realities on the U.S.-Israel relationship could be profound. If,
in the popular imagination, energy is removed from the rationales for
U.S. engagement in the Middle East, some Americans may regard U.S.
support for Israel as the main reason the United States is stuck in the
muck of Middle East war and conflict. Furthermore, [Israelis could worry
that the United States is less committed to Israel as well as to the
region as a whole]{.underline}, [which might]{.underline}
**[reinforce]{.underline}** [a stiff Israeli ethos of self-reliance in
matters of defense]{.underline}. Recall that the very concept of a
Zionist state is rooted in the idea that Jews must defend themselves.
Both the U.S. and Israeli sides could wonder if the special relationship
of the last forty-five years is fading. This does not imply that the
United States would abandon Israel but that the two sides could be less
close than they have been. [Israel and the United States have always had
differences]{.underline}---not infrequently leading to crises--- [but
these could become **more enduring**]{.underline} [if not reinforced by
the same **glue** provided by **active U.S. leadership in the broader
region**]{.underline}.

[U.S. defense strategy and forces today could be at something of an
inflection point.]{.underline} The National Defense Strategy promulgated
by the Trump administration in early 2018, and the largely positive
reception that it has enjoyed, signals the emergence of a recognition
that the capabilities of U.S. military forces have been eroding
vis-à-vis those of key adversaries, especially China and Russia.[1 As a
consequence, the United States' ability to deter aggression and
intimidation, to assure allies, and to influence events in East Asia and
Europe is being undermined]{.underline}. **[Unless steps are taken to
reverse these trends, the United States could find itself playing a
greatly diminished role internationally, irrespective of the strategies
and intentions of this administration or its successors]{.underline}**.
The passage by Congress of a two-year budget agreement for fiscal years
(FYs) 2019 and 2020 that substantially increases funding for the U.S.
Department of Defense (DoD) opens up the possibility of making
investments in new capabilities and regional postures that can improve
the ability of the United States to deter and defeat large-scale
aggression by the most-threatening adversary states. But even the \$165
billion in additional money that would be added to DoD's topline in the
coming two years will not be sufficient to fund every worthy claimant on
DoD's resources.2 [Choices will have to be made if future U.S. forces
are to meet the operational challenges confronting them.]{.underline}
This Perspective is intended to help inform those choices. It addresses
four aspects of the problem: • What are the most important military
challenges facing U.S. forces today and in the future? • [What sort of
armed force is appropriate for the United States, and why?]{.underline}
• [How and in what ways do U.S. forces today fall short of that
standard? • What sorts of measures are called for to fix the problem,
and how feasible is it to implement these?]{.underline} [In the
aftermath of World War II, a broad consensus emerged among Americans
that the nation could no longer accept the risks of a strategy that
eschewed engagement in the security affairs of key parts of
Eurasia]{.underline}. **[History's most destructive conflict showed that
the security and well-being of Americans could only be assured through
active engagement abroad and that a priority goal of that engagement had
to be to ensure that no powerful hegemon gained dominance over the
Eurasian landmass.]{.underline}**3 With the adoption by the Soviet Union
of a hostile, militarized, and expansionist approach to international
relations, implementing this strategy led to the adoption by Washington
of a strategy of containment by means of a U.S.-led Western alliance.
That strategy featured the forward stationing of upward of 500,000 U.S.
military personnel abroad. Over time, the U.S. military alliances with
the industrialized democracies evolved into a dense web of relationships
that encompassed political, economic, technological, and cultural
dimensions. That strategy of engagement and leadership survived the
collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. [By the early
1990s, it was widely recognized that, in an increasingly interdependent
world, Americans could not hope to achieve security and prosperity at
home without the ability to influence actors and shape events
abroad.]{.underline} **[Whether the goal is to protect Americans from
terrorist threats, to limit the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, to ensure adherence to fair trade practices, or to protect
the environment, real progress will require the participation and
support of a broad range of international actors. No state, no matter
how powerful, can achieve these objectives unilaterally.]{.underline}**
[Given the continued global diffusion of knowledge, technology, wealth,
and other instruments of agency, and the increasing connectedness of the
global economy, this reality is not going to change.]{.underline} **[It
is not unreasonable, then, to expect that U.S. national security
strategy will continue to be animated by the realization that no
realistic alternative to international engagement and leadership exists,
rhetoric touting an "America first" approach
notwithstanding]{.underline}**.4 Under these [circumstances, what sort
of armed forces should the United States have?]{.underline} **[The first
strategic priority should be to maintain peace and stability in regions
where the nation has important interests and alliance commitments that
are under stress: East Asia and Europe.]{.underline}** **[This means
that the first military priority is to ensure the viability of key
alliances and to prevent any state with interests hostile to those of
the United States and its allies from gaining a position of overwhelming
dominance in those regions.]{.underline}**5 In practical terms, this
means today that **[U.S. forces must be postured to deter aggression by
China, Russia, and North Korea and, Whether the goal is to protect
Americans from terrorist threats, to limit the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction, to ensure adherence to fair trade practices, or to
protect the environment, real progress will require the participation
and support of a broad range of international actors.]{.underline}** in
conjunction with allies and partners, to defeat such aggression should
deterrence fail.6 In addition to deterring and defeating large-scale
aggression by state adversaries, U.S. forces must also continue, for the
indefinite future, their campaign against violent extremist
organizations, such as ISIS and al Qaeda, that have the potential to
attack U.S. citizens or to destabilize countries or regions of
importance to U.S. interests. [As the fight to date against terrorist
groups shows, long-term success depends on keeping the group's leaders
and networks under unrelenting pressure and building the capabilities of
local forces and government]{.underline}s. Much of the campaign against
such groups will involve financial, intelligence, diplomatic, and
informational instruments. But the U.S. armed forces play crucial roles
in training, advising, and assisting partner governments in countering
terrorists and in conducting direct attacks, when appropriate. U.S.
special operations forces play a leading role here, but they often
require transportation, logistics, and other types of support from the
general-purpose forces. Finally**[, U.S. forces are called upon to
protect the United States itself from attack]{.underline}**. Under
normal circumstances, this means keeping the national missile defense
system and elements of the strategic nuclear forces on alert, being
prepared to intercept airborne threats from hostile powers or
terrorists, and assisting the Department of Homeland Security in
monitoring the nation's borders[. This is a very demanding set of
missions]{.underline}. [Fighting and winning major wars on the territory
of distant countries or in their "backyards" is particularly daunting,
but this is what the bulk of America's armed forces have been trained
and equipped to do since World War II.]{.underline} At present and for
the foreseeable future, the United States alone has the military
wherewithal to project large-scale military forces over intercontinental
distances and conduct sustained military operations across a broad range
of mission sets. This capability is essential in order to offset major
imbalances in military power and to sustain the United States' role as
the security partner of choice for like-minded states. Without it, the
credibility of the U.S. deterrent and of U.S. alliance commitments would
erode, as would U.S. power and influence.

[Most major elements of U.S. defense policy are on reasonably solid
ground, despite innumerable squabbles among experts over many of the
details.]{.underline} Through­out the post--Cold War era, some variant of
a two-war planning framework (with caveats) has enjoyed bipartisan
support and should continue to do so for many years to come. Forward
presence and engagement in East Asia, Europe, and the Middle East remain
compelling pillars of U.S. national security strategy. Robust
research-and-development programs continue to be supported, as does an
unparalleled intelligence com­munity. [The Defense Department's
procurement budget---the first victim of budgetary austerity in the
1990s and in the early years of this century---is once again relatively
healthy. Pentagon leaders are spurring innovation, and the men and women
of today's armed forces display high standards of professionalism,
expertise, and experience.]{.underline} Yet there are also areas of
concern. Excess base capacity remains a problem. [The navy's fleet and
the army are too small, and current budget trajectories imply further
cuts rather than increases. And the scale of some hugely expensive
weapons programs in the pipeline or on the drawing boards, such as the
F-35 fighter jet and some new nuclear weapons, needs to be
reassessed]{.underline}. [The challenge for the next president will thus
be how to build on the strengths, address the problems, and chart a
course for contin­uing to maintain U.S. military dominance in a strategic
environment]{.underline} that never stops evolving. CHANGE VS. MORE OF
THE SAME **[The national interests that the U.S. military needs to
advance remain constant: protecting the homeland; safeguarding U.S.
citizens at home and abroad; and ensuring the security of U.S. allies,
the global economy, and international order more
generally.]{.underline}** These days, threats to those interests come
from five sources: great powers (such as China and Russia), extremist
nonstate actors (such as al Qaeda; the Islamic State, or ISIS; and the
Taliban), rogue states (such as Iran and North Korea), pandemics and
environmental turbulence, and developments in advanced technology that
could increase U.S. vulner­abilities (especially those related to
cyberspace, space, and weapons of mass destruction). Fortunately, the
[United States has many resources to draw on as it prepares for these
threats]{.underline}, even beyond its military forces. The country's
high-tech and innovative sectors are the best in the world. It has solid
economic fundamentals, including a gradually growing population base,
the world's best univer­sities, and a large market at the center of
global finance and commerce. And most important of all, the United
States leads a globe-spanning system of alliances and partnerships that
includes some 60 countries, collectively accounting for two-thirds of
global economic output and military capacity. A [serious defense policy,
however, needs to take into account the way war itself is
changing.]{.underline} [True military revolu­tions are relatively rare,
as even major changes usually occur gradually, over decades. But there
is clearly one such revolution now in process, perhaps halfway along: in
airpower, particularly in the effects of precision ordnance combined
with the vast increase of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnais­sance
(ISR) systems on the contemporary battlefield.]{.underline}

Obviously nobody knows what the future years will feel like, but we do
know that the next decade will have a central feature that was lacking
in the last one: The next few years will be defined by conflict. And
it\'s possible to speculate about what that means. The institutions that
fight for us and defend us against disorder \-- the military, the FBI,
the CIA \-- will seem more important and more admirable. [**The
fundamental arguments won\'t be over economic or social issues, they
will be over how to wield power \-- whether to use American power
aggressively or circumspectly. We will c**are **a lot more** about ends
\-- winning the war \-- than we will about means.]{.underline} We will
debate whether it is necessary to torture prisoners who have information
about future biological attacks. We will destroy innocent villages by
accident, shrug our shoulders, and continue fighting. In an age of
conflict, bourgeois virtues like compassion, tolerance, and
industriousness are valued less than the classical virtues of courage,
steadfastness, and a ruthless desire for victory. \[...continues...\]
But now violence has come calling. Now it is no longer possible to live
so comfortably in one\'s own private paradise. [Shocked out of the
illusion of self-reliance, most of us realize that we, as individuals,
simply cannot protect ourselves. **Private life requires public
protection.**]{.underline} Now it is not possible to ignore foreign
affairs, because foreign affairs have not ignored us. [It has become
clear that **we are living in a world in which hundreds of millions of
people hate us**, and **some** small percentage of them **want to
destroy us**]{.underline}. That realization is bound to have cultural
effects. In the first place, we will probably become more conscious of
our American-ness. During the blitz in 1940, George Orwell sat in his
bomb shelter and wrote an essay called \"England Your England.\" It
opened with this sentence: \"As I write, highly civilised human beings
are flying overhead, trying to kill me.\" What struck him at that moment
of danger was that it really does matter whether you are English or
German. The nation is a nursemaid that breeds certain values and a
certain ethos. Orwell went on to describe what it meant to be English.
Now Americans are being killed simply because they are Americans. Like
Orwell, Americans are once again becoming aware of themselves as a
nationality, not just as members of some ethnic community or globalized
Internet chat group. [Americans have been reminded that, despite what
the multiculturalists have been preaching]{.underline}, [not all
cultures are wonderfully equal hues in the great rainbow of humanity.
**Some national cultures**, the ones that have inherited certain ideas
\-- about freedom and democracy, the limits of the political claims of
religion, the importance of tolerance and dissent \-- **are more humane
than other civilizations, which reject those ideas**]{.underline}. As
criticism of our war effort grows in Europe, in hostile Arab countries,
and in two-faced countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which dislike
our principles but love our dollars, Americans will have to articulate a
defense of our national principles and practices. That debate in itself
will shape American culture. We will begin to see ourselves against the
backdrop of the Taliban. During the Cold War, we saw ourselves in
contrast to the Soviet Union. Back then, we faced a godless foe; now we
are facing a god-crazed foe. As we recoil from the Islamic extremists,
we may be less willing to integrate religion into political life. That
would mean trouble for faith-based initiatives and religion in the
public square. On the other hand, democracies tend to become patriotic
during wartime, if history is any guide, and this will drive an even
deeper wedge between regular Americans and the intellectual class.
Literary critic Paul Fussell, a great student of American culture in
times of war, wrote a book, Wartime, on the cultural effects of World
War II. Surveying the culture of that period, he endorsed the view of
historian Eileen Sullivan, who wrote, \"[**There was no room in this war
culture for individual opinions or personalities, no freedom of dissent
or approval; the culture was homogeneous, shallow and
boring**.\"]{.underline} \[...continues...\] Don\'t make the mistake of
interpreting the events of Sept. 11 purely in terms of terrorism and
murder. . . . The terrorists are a virulent subset of a much larger
group of anticapitalists, one that includes many politicians,
bureaucrats, writers, media types, academics, entertainers, trade
unionists and, at times, church leaders. The barbarians at the gates are
more numerous than you thought. But the most important cultural effect
of conflict is that it breeds a certain bloody-mindedness or, to put it
more grandly, a tragic view of life. Life in times of war and recession
reminds us of certain hard truths that were easy to ignore during the
decade of peace and prosperity. [**Evil exists**. Difficulties, even
**tragedies, are inevitable**. Human beings are flawed creatures capable
of monstrosity. Not all cultures are compatible**. To preserve order,
good people must exercise power over destructive people.**]{.underline}
That means that [it\'s no longer sufficient to deconstruct ideas and
texts and signifiers**. You have to be able to construct hard principles
so you can move from one idea to the next**, because when you are faced
with the problem of repelling evil, you absolutely must be able to reach
a conclusion on serious moral issues.]{.underline} This means you need
to think in moral terms about force \-- and to be tough-minded. During
the Cold War, Reinhold Niebuhr was a major intellectual figure. In 1952,
he wrote The Irony of American History. The tragedy of the conflict with
communism, he argued, was that, \"though confident of its virtue,
**[\[America\] must yet hold atomic bombs ready for use so as to prevent
a possible world conflagration]{.underline}**.\" The irony of our
history, he continued, is that we are an idealistic nation that dreams
of creating a world of pure virtue, yet in defeating our enemies we
sometimes have to act in ways that are not pure. \"We take, and must
continue to take, morally hazardous action to preserve our
civilization,\" Niebuhr wrote. \"**[We must exercise our
power]{.underline}**.\" We have to do so while realizing that we will
not be capable of perfect disinterestedness when deciding which actions
are just. We will be influenced by dark passions. **[But we still have
to act forcefully because our enemies are trying to destroy the basis of
civilization: \"We are drawn into an historic situation in which the
paradise of our domestic security is suspended in a hell of global
insecurity]{.underline}**.\" Niebuhr\'s prescription was humble
hawkishness. He believed the United States should forcefully defend
freedom and destroy its enemies. But while doing so, it should seek
forgiveness for the horrible things it might have to do in a worthy
cause. To reach this graduate-school level of sophistication, you have
to have passed through elementary courses in moral reasoning. It will be
interesting to see whether we Americans, who sometimes seem unsure of
even the fundamental moral categories, can educate ourselves
sufficiently to engage in the kind of moral reasoning that Niebuhr did.
The greatest political effect of this period of conflict will probably
be to relegitimize central institutions. Since we can\'t defend
ourselves as individuals against terrorism, we have to rely on the
institutions of government: the armed forces, the FBI, the CIA, the CDC,
and so on. We are now only beginning to surrender some freedoms, but we
will trade in more, and willingly. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in the
Federalist Papers, \"Safety from external danger is the most powerful
director of national conduct. Even the ardent love of liberty will,
after a time, give way to its dictates. . . . To be more safe,
\[people\] at length become willing to run the risk of being less
free.\" Moreover, we will see power migrate from the states and Capitol
Hill to the White House. \"It is of the nature of war to increase the
executive at the expense of the legislative authority,\" Hamilton
continued. This creates rifts on both left and right, because both
movements contain anti-establishment elements hostile to any effort to
relegitimize central authorities. The splits have been most spectacular
on the left. Liberals who work in politics \-- Democrats on Capitol
Hill, liberal activists, academics who are interested in day-to-day
politics \-- almost all support President Bush and the war effort. But
many academic and literary leftists, ranging from Eric Foner to Susan
Sontag to Noam Chomsky, have been sour, critical, and contemptuous of
America\'s response to September 11. The central difference is that the
political liberals are comfortable with power. [**They want power
themselves and do not object to the central institutions of government,
even the military, exercising power on our behalf**. Many]{.underline}
[literary and academic liberals, on the other hand, have built a whole
moral system around powerlessness.]{.underline} They champion the
outgroups. **[They stand with the victims of hegemony, patriarchy,
colonialism, and all the other manifestations of central authority.
Sitting on their campuses, they are powerless themselves]{.underline}**,
and have embraced a delicious, self-glorifying identity as the
out-manned sages who alone can see through the veils of propaganda in
which the powerful hide their oppressive schemes. For these thinkers,
virtue inheres in the powerless. The weak are sanctified, not least
because they are voiceless and allegedly need academics to give them
voices. These outgroup leftists dislike the Taliban, but to ally
themselves with American power would be to annihilate everything they
have stood for and the role they have assigned themselves in society.
\[...continues...\] For Bush, the leader of the free world, the issue is
terrorism, not street crime. But now he too is engaged in the effort to
restore order so that people can go about their lives. He is the one
rounding up the posse, forsaking social issues and other moral debates
for a straightforward act of international prosecution. He is
reasserting authority to show that under Pax Americana, the world is
governable. \[...continues...\] But history never repeats itself neatly.
No one can predict the political and cultural consequences of a war, any
more than the course of the war itself. But it does seem clear that we
have moved out of one political and cultural moment and into another. We
have traded the anxieties of affluence for the real fears of war. We
have moved from an age of peace to an age of conflict, and in times of
conflict people are different. They go to extremes. Some people, and
some nations, turn cowardly or barbaric. Other people, and other
nations, become heroic, brave, and steadfast. It all depends on what
they have in them. War isn\'t only, as Bourne said, the health of the
state. It\'s the gut-check of the nation.

#### Military projection solves great power wars\-\--no alternatives\-\--transition goes nuclear

**Twining, 17** - director of the Asia Program at The German Marshall
Fund of the United States, based in Washington, DC, MPhil & DPhil
degrees from Oxford University (Daniel, \"The Liberal International
Order Cannot Survive the Absence of American Power,\" *Medium*,
5-24-2017,
https://medium.com/out-of-order/the-liberal-international-order-cannot-survive-the-absence-of-american-power-835855336480)

One challenge in navigating the debate over the future of the liberal
world order is that [American power has been the **primary source** of
that order, but the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is an
imperfect practitioner of its own grand strategy of promoting a
rules-based global system]{.underline}. Criticism of the liberal
international order often defaults into criticism of American foreign
policy, or of American political leadership past and present. Or it
turns into an Alice-in-Wonderland fantasy of what the world could be
like if only power was shared democratically, if only multilateral
institutions were not governed by great powers, or if only countries did
not pursue narrow self-interests.

American leadership of the international system since the early 1940s
has certainly been preferable to the alternatives.

No nation governed by human beings will ever be perfect, just as no
country's statecraft will ever be truly enlightened. But [American
leadership of the international system since the early 1940s has
certainly been **preferable to the alternatives **]{.underline}--- the
[victory of Nazi Germany]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Imperial Japan
in World War II]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} the [extension of Soviet
power after 1945 to encompass]{.underline} not just eastern Europe but
[all of it]{.underline}.

As part of its leadership, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[constructed an **institutional
architecture**]{.underline} --- including [military alliances like NATO
and multilateral organizations like the U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations --- [that gave lesser powers not only **security
guarantees**]{.underline} [but defined a **set of rules** governing the
global commons]{.underline}, the [extent and limits of state
sovereignty]{.underline}, an [open international economy]{.underline}
governed by markets, [and norms of global good citizenship]{.underline}.

These were shared endeavors in which the United States worked with
allies in Europe and Japan as well as with other nations including the
Soviet Union and China. But make no mistake: the United States in 1945
and again in 1991 dominated over the other great powers as a result of
first a hot war and then a cold one. Leaders in Washington could have
pursued raw forms of hegemony that did not constrain American power
through multilateral institutions or reciprocal alliance commitments and
which did not open the American market to former competitors. That the
United States did so was the result of a bet that America could not be
secure or prosperous in a world that wasn't.

The problem today is that [the liberal international order worked
perhaps **too well** to uplift Western competitors like
China]{.underline} --- [whose access to the American market in no way
reciprocates American access to the Chinese market]{.underline}, [and
whose military ambitions are **incapable of being balanced** by any
nation other than the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. The
[European solidarity]{.underline} that arose under the American defense
umbrella and grew out of the Marshall Plan has [led
advocates]{.underline} of the European Union [to believe]{.underline}
that [they can handle their own security ]{.underline}--- or at least it
did **[until Russia invaded Ukraine]{.underline}**.

Countries like today's [Russia]{.underline}, whose imperial predecessor
was defeated not only by the power of the NATO alliance but by the
values of the democratic West, [want to erode the liberal order so they
can return to a **spheres-of-influence**]{.underline} [world in which
democratic values have little standing]{.underline}. Countries like
[China have similar]{.underline} though perhaps [**more ambitious**
goals]{.underline}, [including replacing the consensual hub-and-spokes
U.S. alliance system with one centered on Beijing]{.underline} and
organized coercively in hierarchical fashion, as befits the traditional
Middle Kingdom.

Countries like [India]{.underline} are rising as world powers, but [have
**yet to embrace the responsibilities**]{.underline} that come with
sitting at the apex of the international system. Much easier, especially
for those Indians still in hoc to Third Worldism and deference to a
defunct Non-Aligned Movement, to critique America for having sponsored
international institutions that privileged the rich West, even though
the form of [open globalization]{.underline} these institutions produced
[have been the **greatest sources of prosperity** for rising powers in
Asia]{.underline}.

[It]{.underline} [is an **error** to conflate the liberal world order
with the daily twists and turns of American foreign policy]{.underline}.
Doing so produces muddled thinking, like simultaneously criticizing the
United States for political outcomes in Iraq (where America intervened)
and Syria (where it did not), as if Washington were a puppeteer and no
other country had it within its power to shape developments in these
places far removed from American shores.

[Even as the liberal international order is not simply a proxy for
American foreign policy]{.underline}, at the same time [a global
rules-based system is **unlikely to survive the absence of American
power**]{.underline}. If not reversed, [the **most likely** outcome of
the retrenchment]{.underline} launched by President Obama,
**[compounded]{.underline}** [by the confusion produced by America's
current political constellation]{.underline}, [is a world riven by **raw
balance-of-power dynamics**]{.underline}, [producing spheres of
influence and potentially **great-power war** while eroding the open
international economic]{.underline} [order that has lifted billions
across the developing world out of poverty]{.underline}. [A world
governed by **protectionism**]{.underline},
**[nationalism]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[armed territorial
contestation]{.underline}** [would not in any way be
liberal]{.underline}.

In this predicament, international institutions would not work better,
global governance would not be more democratic, rising powers whose
economies and energy supply are dependent on secure global commons might
stop rising, supranational institutions like the EU would lose their
soft-power advantage in a hard-power environment, and democrats
everywhere would be on the retreat as strongmen grew ascendant. [Those
who have grown tired of America's imperfect leadership of the world it
created]{.underline} --- including voters in the United States who tell
pollsters their country should mind its own business --- [should be
careful what they wish for]{.underline}.

**US pulling out will fail and result in war**

**Zhang and Shi 11** Yuhan, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace
and Lin Shi, Columbia University, "**America's decline: A harbinger of
conflict and rivalry,"** January 22nd, 2011
http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/01/22/americas-decline-a-harbinger-of-conflict-and-rivalry/

[Over the past two decades, no other state has had the ability to
seriously challenge the US military. Under these circumstances,
motivated by both opportunity and fear, many actors have bandwagoned
with US hegemony and accepted a subordinate role. Canada, most of
Western Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Singapore and the
Philippines have all joined the US, **creating a status quo that has
tended to mute great power conflicts**]{.underline}. However, [[as the
hegemony that drew these powers together
withers](http://www.cfr.org/publication/23537/belttightening_for_us_foreign_policy.html),
so will the pulling power behind the US alliance. The result will be an
international order where power is more diffuse, American interests and
influence can be more readily challenged, and conflicts or wars may be
harder to avoid.]{.underline} As history attests, [power decline and
redistribution result in military confrontation]{.underline}. [For
example, in the late 19th century America's emergence as a regional
power saw it launch its first overseas war of conquest towards
Spain]{.underline}. By the turn of the 20th century, accompanying the
[increase in US power and waning of British power, the American Navy had
begun to challenge the notion that Britain 'rules the waves.' Such a
notion would eventually see the US attain the status of sole guardians
of the Western Hemisphere's security to become the order-creating
Leviathan shaping the international system with democracy and rule of
law.]{.underline} Defining this [US-centred system are three key
characteristics: enforcement of property rights, constraints on the
actions of powerful individuals and groups and some degree of equal
opportunities for broad segments of society]{.underline}. [As a result
of such political stability, free markets, liberal trade and flexible
financial mechanisms have appeared]{.underline}. And, with this, many
countries have sought opportunities to enter this system, proliferating
stable and cooperative relations. However, what will happen to these
advances [as America's influence declines? Given that America's
authority, although sullied at times, has benefited people across much
of Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans, as well as
parts of Africa and, quite extensively, Asia, the answer to this
question could affect global society in a profoundly detrimental
way.]{.underline} Public imagination and academia have anticipated that
a [**post-hegemonic world would return to the problems of the 1930s:
regional blocs, trade conflicts and strategic rivalry**. Furthermore,
multilateral institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank or the WTO
might give way to regional organisations.]{.underline} For example,
[Europe and East Asia would each step forward to fill the vacuum left by
Washington's withering leadership to pursue their own visions of
regional political and economic orders. Free markets would become more
politicised --- and, well, less free --- and major powers would compete
for supremacy.]{.underline} Additionally, such power plays have
historically possessed a zero-sum element. In the late 1960s and 1970s,
[US economic power declined relative to the rise of the Japanese and
Western European economies, with the US dollar also becoming less
attractive. And, as American power eroded, so did international
regimes]{.underline} (such as the Bretton Woods System in 1973). [**A
world without American hegemony is one where great power wars re-emerge,
the liberal international system is supplanted by an authoritarian one,
and trade protectionism devolves into restrictive, anti-globalisation
barriers.** This, at least, is one possibility we can forecast in a
future that will inevitably be devoid of unrivalled US
primacy.]{.underline}

Affairs at [Princeton

[Power transitions are a recurring problem in international relations.
As scholars such as Paul Kennedy and Robert Gilpin have described it,
world politics has been marked by a succession of powerful states rising
up to organize the international system. A powerful state can create and
enforce the rules and institutions of a stable global order in which to
pursue its interests and security. But nothing lasts forever: long-term
changes in the distribution of power give rise to new challenger states,
who set off a struggle over the terms of that international order.
**Rising states want to translate their newly acquired power into
greater authority in the global system \-- to reshape the rules and
institutions in accordance with their own interests. Declining states,
in turn, fear their loss of control and worry about the security
implications of their weakened position.** These moments are fraught
with danger. When a state occupies a commanding position in the
international system, neither it nor weaker states have an incentive to
change the existing order. **But when the power of a challenger state
grows and the power of the leading state weakens, a strategic rivalry
ensues, and conflict** \-- perhaps **leading to war** \-- **becomes
likely**. The danger of power transitions is captured most dramatically
in the case of late-nineteenth-century Germany. In 1870, the United
Kingdom had a three-to-one advantage in economic power over Germany and
a significant military advantage as well; by 1903, Germany had pulled
ahead in terms of both economic and military power. As Germany unified
and grew, so, too, did its dissatisfactions and demands, and as it grew
more powerful, it increasingly appeared as a threat to other great
powers in Europe, and security competition began. In the strategic
realignments that followed, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom,
formerly enemies, banded together to confront an emerging Germany. The
result was a European war. Many observers see this dynamic emerging in
U.S.-Chinese relations. **\"If China continues its impressive economic
growth over the next few decades,\"** the realist scholar John
Mearsheimer has written, **\"the United States and China are likely to
engage in an intense security competition with considerable potential
for war.\"**]{.underline}

T.L.")

"It has been China's dream for a century to become the world's leading
nation," wrote Liu Mingfu, then a colonel in the People's Liberation
Army, in his 2010 bookThe China Dream. [After taking over as general
secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012, Xi Jinping

a defense-policy white paper laying out an expanded role for the navy in
the context of U.S.-China tensions over China's construction of islands
in disputed waters in the South China Sea.]{.underline} [The U.S.

construction was "legal, reasonable ... and neither impacts nor targets
any country." [The United States has

[hawks](http://us.macmillan.com/thehundredyearmarathon/michaelpillsbury),
and Liu is essentially an America hawk within China]{.underline}. After
the initial publication of Liu's book, Phillip C. Saunders of the U.S.
National Defense University
[called](http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=36217#.VW4W-GRVikq)
it a "sensationalist" tract "aimed at tapping into a profitable mass
market \... rather than \[promoting\] political orthodoxy," and the book
appears to have put its publisher briefly at odds with the government.
The Wall Street Journal
[reported](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324128504578348774040546346)
that The China Dream "flew off the shelves but was pulled over concerns
it could damage relations with the U.S." In the Xi era, however, the
Journal's Jeremy Page spotted it in the "recommended books" section of a
state-run bookstore. (Liu
[told](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324128504578348774040546346)
Page he didn't know whether Xi himself had read it, but said Xi's "China
Dream" speeches had sent "a strong message.") Liu is representative of a
new class of pundits in China that former Financial TimesBeijing bureau
chief Geoff Dyer has compared to America's "[TV
generals](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2003/03/the_tv_generals.html),"
retired officers who opine on military matters in the media. "In the
last few years," Dyer wrote in his book The Contest of the Century,
"something similar has happened in China. [A small number of
media-friendly members of the armed forces have begun to talk openly
about military matters, including their mistrust of and distaste for the
U.S. military and its policies in Asia]{.underline}. \... In some ways,
Senior Colonel Liu Mingfu is the latest addition to their numbers."
[**The colonel has now retired from the military, and the path to global
dominance he laid out five years ago was a bit more flexible than
Xi**']{.underline}s[; Liu reckoned it might take China another five
decades to replace the United States as world leade]{.underline}r.
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has called the book an example
of a "triumphalist" strain in Chinese thinking, which
[argues](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703864204576315223305697158)
that "no matter how much China commits itself to a 'peaceful rise,'
conflict is inherent in U.S.-China relations." Kissinger noted that the
hawks' vision of inevitable U.S.-China conflict hasn't been endorsed by
either the Chinese or the American governments, but that "if the
assumptions of these views were applied by either side---and it would
only take one side to make it unavoidable---China and the U.S. could
easily fall into an escalating tension." What follows is a condensed
excerpt of one Chinese hawk's view of what the "China Age" will look
like, and his roadmap for how China will get there. [It outlines a
vision of Chinese superiority informed by the experience of America's
own rise to superpower status and conduct as the world's preeminent
power.]{.underline} His descriptions are general, and his prescriptions
vague, [but he asserts that the Chinese century will be a democratic
one. If this strikes Americans as incongruous given China's [domestic
system](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/05/chinese-democracy-isnt-inevitable/394325/),
Liu's contention is that America itself is only "half
democratic"---electing its leaders at home but "autocratic in the
world.]{.underline}" He continues: "Americans overrate themselves and
evaluate themselves untruthfully by saying that they are a democratic
country." And it is China that in Liu's view can provide the "checks and
balances" against America necessary to "form a democratic world." The
appearance of every champion nation begins a new era. [The China Age, at
its most basic, will be an age of prosperity. In \[early Chinese
revolutionary\] Sun Yat-sen's evaluation of the West's conception of
Yellow Peril, he said that in the future, China's era would not be one
of Yellow Peril, but of Yellow Favor. The China Age will not be one in
which China threatens the world, it will be one in which China enriches
the world.]{.underline} America's GDP surpassed Great Britain's in 1895
to become the world's largest. \[Editor's note: OECD estimates show U.S.
per-capita GDP
[overtaking](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7174996.stm) that of the
United Kingdom sometime in the 1890s.\] But it was only after 1945, half
a century after America's GDP outpaced Great Britain's, [that the United
States replaced Great Britain as world leader. China's GDP is still
smaller than America's; it may take China 50 years to overtake America's
GDP and replace it as world leader. **There is still no need for America
to be nervous. China should not be in a rush to be a leader; it should
allow America to keep the position until a time that is best for all
sides. Before**]{.underline} China can take over as world leader in the
21st century, it will need half a century to work through three stages.
[**The first will be catching up to America and actively taking a
leading role where it can in the world**; the second will be racing
neck-and-neck with America, and leading the world as an equal partner
with America; and the third stage will be guiding the world through
exercising leadership and management in the world, and thereby becoming
the world's leading nation. China is already actively participating in
leadership where it can, and moving toward becoming America's equal.
This stage will last for another 20 to 30 years.]{.underline} In 1987,
American history professor Paul Kennedy of Yale University researched
the favorable and adverse conditions surrounding China's rise. [He
pointed out that China was the poorest of the countries wishing to be a
great power and occupied the worst strategic position.]{.underline}
These, he said, were two adverse conditions that would limit China's
rise, but he also pointed out two favorable conditions: one was that
[China's leaders had "an ambitious, coherent, and visionary strategy,
one that could beat Moscow, Washington, and Tokyo, not to mention
Western Europe"; the other was that "China would continue to develop
economically, and could be a vastly different country within several
decades." His analysis of China's strategy was very accurate. China's
rise was, before all else, the rise of its strategy.]{.underline}
China's rise and revival cannot be limited to a strictly economic rise,
and China's role as a great power cannot be limited to a major economic
role. [Those who think China's rise is not an ideological and military
rise, or who think China's rise is just an economic rise, and that China
is only rising to become an economic power or a GDP power, are making a
strategic mistake. A rich nation without a strong military is an
insecure power]{.underline}. A nation without technological innovation
is a country that can't produce a scientific rise, and in an era where
the knowledge economy is the most productive force, it is a country that
can't be strong economically. **[If China limits its rise to purely
economic goals, it will produce a hobbled global power, a kind of global
power that doesn't last.]{.underline}** To create a nation like that
would be equivalent to cutting short China's rise and the revival of the
Chinese people.

#### US hegemony prevents war

AA)

[**American military hegemony in Europe, Asia and the Middle East
depends on the ability of the U.S. military to threaten**
and]{.underline}, if necessary, to [**use military force to defeat any
regional challenge-but at a relatively low cost**.]{.underline} This is
because the American public is not prepared to pay the costs necessary
if the United States is to be a \"hyperpower.\" Given this premise, the
obsession with the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other
Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) makes perfect sense. **[WMD are
defensive weapons that offer poor states a possible defensive shield
against the sword of unexcelled U.S. conventional military
superiority.]{.underline}** The success of the United States in using
superior conventional force to defeat Serbia and Iraq (twice) may have
accelerated the efforts of India, Pakistan, North Korea and Iran to
obtain nuclear deterrents. As an Indian admiral observed after the Gulf
War, \"The lesson is that [you should not go to war with the United
States unless you have nuclear weapons.\"]{.underline} Moreover, it is
clear that the United States treats countries that possess WMD quite
differently from those that do not. So proliferation undermines American
regional hegemony in two ways. First, [it forces the U.S. military to
adopt costly and awkward strategies in wartime. Second, **it discourages
intimidated neighbors of the nuclear state from allowing American bases
and military build-ups on its soil.**]{.underline}

[The Taiwan case offers the strongest evidence confirming the
pessimistic predictions of power-transition theory]{.underline}. Yet,
the other cases described above suggest that power-transition theory may
also have relevance beyond the Taiwan Strait. Despite China's currently
cooperative behavior in Southeast Asia and Korea, [power-transition
theory predicts trouble ahead once a rising state gains the ability to
press its demands against regional rivals and the currently dominant US
power behind them that it must now accommodate]{.underline}. The absence
of a challenge while it is easily rebuffed is interpreted as simply the
rational choice of a cost-sensitive actor, biding its time until it can
act on its preferences with the expectation that it can prevail at an
acceptable price. In considering the longer-term prospect of a rising
China, power-transition theory directs attention to the vision that
outgoing leader Jiang Zemin articulated in 2002 -- that at least the
first two decades of the twenty-first century will be a 'period of
strategic opportunity' during which a less dangerous international
environment provides China with a chance to emphasize the modernization
program that will enable the country to achieve the status of a true
great power. **[Power-transition theory]{.underline}**, then,
**[suggests that China's present policies in the South China Sea and
towards tension on the Korean peninsula mean only that Beijing is stuck
making the best of its disadvantageous position during the early stages
of its ascent.]{.underline}** The theory's expectation is that the
current approach embracing multilateral institutions to manage sometimes
conflicting interests in these two cases will not last. When China
eventually has the power to shape outcomes in ways that serve its
national interests, either the existing institutions will become
vehicles for Beijing to exercise greater influence, or China will cease
to rely on them. This perspective, in other words, envisions a Chinese
great power treating international institutions in the American fashion
-- working through them when they can facilitate the exercise of
Washington's power, but resorting to unilateral or US-led ad hoc
coalitions when it concludes that this approach better serves American
interests. Institutionalist [theory and its expectations about the role
an increasingly powerful, but also increasingly wealthy and economically
integrated, China will play in coming decades is not, however,
decisively discredited by the situation in the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline} and until there is a noticeable change in the
currently cooperative, multilateral approach to managing relations in
the South China Sea and on the Korean peninsula[, it is plausible to
view the Taiwan case as an important exception to the broader usefulness
of institutionalist theory]{.underline}, not a preview of what China
will do elsewhere when its growing power make this feasible, as
power-transition theory suggests. [The assertion that Taiwan is an
exception can be defended by arguing that few international issues rise
to the level of existential zero-sumness that characterizes this
dispute, certainly not any of the foreseeable disagreements in Asia that
China may have with its neighbors or the US in a world where the
Manichaean struggle between rival ideological systems has
disappeared]{.underline}. [Unlike typical territorial, boundary, or
economic disputes, the Taiwan question is about the survival of the
polity that has been created on the island since 1949, and to a lesser
extent about the ability of the CCP regime on the mainland to ensure its
leadership over the farflung and ethnically diverse territories it
inherited from its predecessors.]{.underline} For many on the island of
Taiwan, however great the benefits of institutionalizing ties with the
mainland, these [material gains cannot offset the loss of political
identity entailed in finally accepting that they are to be part of the
larger Chinese nation-state.]{.underline} For many on the mainland,
however small the cost that would follow from writing off political
control of Taiwan (especially since the island's relative economic and
military significance diminishes as China's capabilities grow, and since
economic relations can continue without political integration), this
material loss pales in comparison to the domestic and international
implications for the regime's reputation. **[History]{.underline}**
(and, as importantly, the interpretation of history fostered by the CCP
over the past 58 years) **[make it difficult for Beijing's leaders to
accept 'losing Taiwan' without a struggle.]{.underline}** [Doing so
would almost certainly be read as a betrayal of what has routinely been
presented as their obligation to finally fulfill the modern nationalist
movement's central task of unifying a China whose territories were split
apart]{.underline} during the era when Beijing had been unable to stand
up to foreign meddling. [Unlike the other flashpoints examined here, the
**Taiwan dispute is one in which a rising China will almost certainly
insist on satisfying demands long frustrated by American
preponderance.**]{.underline}

#### US disarmament creates an unstable world

**Tooley, 15** -- \[Mark Tooley, Graduate from Georgetown University,
Work at the CIA, 3-19-2015, Christianity and Nukes American nuclear
disarmament will not leave the world safer or holier, The American
Spectator,
<http://spectator.org/articles/62090/christianity-and-nukes>\]

**[Much of the security of the world relies on the U.S. nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}**, which continues to deter, protect, and
intimidate. Doubtless China would vastly expand its own relatively
minimal nuclear arsenal and seek parity at least with Russia absent
overwhelming U.S. power. Russia's nuclear arsenal is engorged far beyond
its strategic needs, and that arsenal has in fact been blessed by the
Russian Orthodox Church, which evidently also falls outside the
"ecumenical consensus." Some religious idealists imagine that disarming
the West, mainly [the U.S., will inspire and motivate the world to
follow suit]{.underline}. [Such expectation is based on a fundamentally
and dangerously false view of global statecraft and human
nature]{.underline}. **[The power vacuum that American disarmament would
create would inexorably lead to a far more dangerous and unstable world
where nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction would
exponentially proliferate]{.underline}**. [American military and nuclear
hegemony for the last 70 years has sustained an historically
unprecedented approximate global peace and facilitated an even more
unprecedented global prosperity.]{.underline} **[There is indeed a moral
and strategic imperative for America today, which is to deploy its power
against further nuclear proliferation and to deter aggression by current
nuclear actors]{.underline}**, while also developing technologies and
defensive weapons that neutralize nuclear armaments. If Iran's
genocidally ambitious regime is in the end prevented from nuclearizing,
it will only be thanks to American power. And if it does nuclearize,
[only American and Israeli nukes, perhaps joined by Saudi nukes, will
deter its murderous designs]{.underline}. Christian teaching and
humanity should demand no less.

War has changed since 9/11. [The]{.underline} United States
([US]{.underline}) [military now concerns itself with
cyberspace]{.underline}, [natural disasters]{.underline},
[disease]{.underline} epidemics, state-building, [and much
more;]{.underline} while still maintaining what Huntington considers to
be its traditional role, "to kill people in the most efficient way
possible." As the Department of State (DoD) struggles to adapt to a
world in which security threats are ever-changing and coming from
increasingly different sources, the role of the military therefore
becomes less clear. Following the declaration of the 'War on Terror',
the Defense Department marked a significant shift in how the military
was to conceive of its own role in a "war against a nameless, stateless,
formless enemy -- an enemy with goals as uncertain as its methods...."
Accordingly, [US military doctrine began to evolve.]{.underline} The
Bush administration found itself presiding over large-scale military
state-building initiatives in both Iraq and Afghanistan, recognizing
that promoting stability was essential in preventing new conflicts and
resolving old ones. [As the military's role becomes more blurred, it
becomes increasingly separated from the broader society and civilian
institutions of foreign policy.]{.underline} [One thing remains
constant, however, and that is: the need to protect the interests and
the security of the US, by any means necessary.]{.underline} [Shifting
global powers]{.underline}, and the enduring Global War on Terrorism
[has created a]{.underline} rather unique [foreign policy challenge for
many Western states]{.underline} -- [particularly the US]{.underline} --
[which has created unforeseen pressure]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
their [diplomatic, economic, military, and social influence around the
world.]{.underline} US military forces have been deployed globally at an
increasing rate with the objective to influence political goals, wage
war, and provide humanitarian relief. Since the Second World War (WWII),
the securitization, and in turn, the militarization of American
diplomacy has rapidly evolved. From the implementation of the global
interventionist foreign policy adopted after WWII, and surely since the
events of 9/11, the military has gradually taken on a role independent
of its original mandate, which was once in the jurisdiction of civilian
agencies. Americans have come to accept this in the name of national
security. This notion of 'security' is used deliberately to characterize
the existing or perceived threats that challenge a state's well-being.
As one scholar argues, this "seeming imperative to protect that
'security' instinctively points us toward coercive force as the answer."
Thus, [the notion of securitization]{.underline} -- as advanced by the
copenhagen school of security studies -- [is important "for
understanding how foreign policy is developed because framing issues as
ones of security]{.underline}, and engaging in whatever actions are
required to solve the issue[, have proved time and time again to be a
fundamental tool]{.underline} in the arsenal of states." Following the
attacks of 9/11, it has become apparent that military prevention is just
as important as a military cure to perceived threats that challenge the
interests of the US. In that case, it can be argued, then, that
post-9/11 changes in military doctrine and activities to address these
increasing security threats have led to civil-military tensions. This is
in part due to resources and authorities flowing to the Pentagon, "while
budgets for civilian foreign policy agencies and programs remained
largely stagnant." The severity of this reallocation of resources and
capabilities away from civilian foreign policy institutions to military
agencies is evident in former defence secretary Robert Gates' seminal
speech on defence expenditure given in 2007: "Consider this year's
budget for the Department of Defense -- not counting operations in Iraq
and Afghanistan -- is nearly half a trillion dollars \[while\] the total
foreign affairs budget request for the State Department is \$36
billion.... There are only about 6,600 professional Foreign Service
officers -- less than the manning for one aircraft carrier strike
group." In comparison, by mid-2008, "there were 1.6 million active-duty
military personnel, nearly 1.6 million members of the Reserves and the
National Guard, and 673,000 civilian employees in the Defense
Department." Yet, a decade later, US civil-military relations continue
to remain contentious as the DoD expands military operations into areas
once held under the purview of civilian foreign affairs agencies, and
accordingly, expands its budget to meet these new challenges. To
enumerate, President Trump stunned US diplomats and security experts in
his pledge of a 'historic increase' of \$54 billion in military
spending, bringing the 2017 Pentagon budget to \$603 billion. He has
stated that his proposal was a "landmark event and would send a message
of American strength, security, and resolve to other countries."
However, this increase in the defence budget -- which is one-sixth of
the federal budget and already greater than any country in the world,
comes as the US slowly winds down major wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,
and remains the world's strongest military power. Moreover, the Trump
administration has indicated that it would "expand the Army to 540,000
active-duty troops from its current 480,000, increase the Marine Corps
to 36 battalions from 23 -- or as many as 10,000 more Marines -- boost
the Navy to 350 ships and submarines from 276, and raise the number of
Air Force tactical aircraft to 1,200 from 1,100." President Trump notes
that this increase in spending and expanding of military strength would
force the elimination of foreign assistance programs and be offset by
cuts to the State Department, all of which receives only \$50 billion
annually. However, President Trump does not have the final say on
federal spending, as Congress has the 'power of purse'. As such, any
increase in defence spending will be met by negotiations with lawmakers.
Already, much of Congress -- both Democrats and Republicans -- have
questioned the need for an increase in military spending, with more than
120 retired US generals and admirals urging Congress to fully fund US
diplomacy and foreign aid, stating that "elevating and strengthening
diplomacy and development alongside defense are critical to keeping
America safe." This "gutting of America's 'soft power' institutions has
led the DoD to take on 'many of \[the\] burdens that might have been
assumed by civilian agencies in the past." Are we then, as Brooks
suggests, witnessing the securitization and "militarization of US
foreign policy," and if so, what does this mean for US civil-military
relations? "A failure to address the increasing securitization of US
foreign policy... will only continue to challenge the current
civil-military divide and threaten the stability of the state." Although
Congress indeed securitizes issues pertaining to foreign affairs, [the
military apparatus and DoD]{.underline} nonetheless [implement the
foreign policy]{.underline}. This imbalance between DoD and civilian
foreign policy institutions clearly has an impact on how the two sets of
institutions are dealt with by the White House and in the formulation
and implementation of foreign policy. Foreign policy is achieved in the
aforementioned manner because "DoD and the military bring to the table
significant assets: an institutional capacity to act quickly, a
constituency of public support... long-term strategic and planning
capabilities, and the capacity to measure and demonstrate results."
Whereas, on the other hand, [the "civilian foreign policy institutions
are hampered by fewer resources]{.underline}, internal and interagency
coordination challenges... [a much smaller operational capability,
\[and\] an absence of strategic planning]{.underline}, and difficulty in
demonstrating results." As a result of this divergence between civilian
institutions and DoD's capabilities for implementing foreign policy
initiatives, over time, the Defense Department and the corresponding
military services have been tasked with developing the capability to
increase its scope of missions and functions that are not core to
military combat or deterrence. [This has resulted in a "growing
imbalance in the resources and capabilities of the major institutions of
American statecraft]{.underline}.... [This]{.underline}, in turn,
[reinforces the policymakers' tendency to call upon DoD for rapid
response and planning]{.underline}, \[thus\] exacerbating the disparity
in resources and capabilities." Such quests for endless, unbounded
warfare has us "trapped in a vicious circle: asking the military to take
on more and more nontraditional tasks, \[which\] requires exhausting our
all-volunteer military force and necessitates higher military budgets.
Higher military budgets force us to look for savings elsewhere so we...
cut spending on civilian diplomacy and development...." Undoubtedly,
such budget cuts will render civilian institutions traditionally
responsible for regulating foreign affairs through diplomacy meaningless
and ineffective. [In order to counteract the failure of civilian
institutions, we then turn to the military to fill the gap in
capabilities and resources]{.underline}, further expanding its role in
foreign activities and further straining the military apparatus in
ensuring the security and stability of the state. Certainly, [the
securitization of actor(s) and foreign policy objectives has become
increasingly prevalent within the institutional framework of the US,
particularly within Congress]{.underline}. This has resulted in a "gap
in civil-military relations, \[which\] has reached a critical divide.
With civilian leaders relying on the armed forces to perform an
increasing number of duties, the military must reconnect with the
public." A failure to address the increasing securitization of US
foreign policy -- notably, in the areas of humanitarian interventions,
stability operations, and diplomacy -- will only continue to challenge
the current civil-military divide and threaten the stability of the
state. It therefore becomes important to understand how states can
reconcile a military that is strong enough to do anything that the
civilians ask of it, while at the same time ensures that a military
remains subordinate enough to do only what the civilians and the state
authorizes it to do.

### Realism Inevitable

#### Realism Inev

**Mearsheimer 14** \-- Professor of political science at the University
of Chicago, PhD in international relations (John J., "Realism Reader,"
edited by Colin Elman and Michael A. Jensen, London ; New York :
Routledge, Taylor & Francis Group, p. 179-188, JB)

[Great powers]{.underline}, I argue, [are always searching for
opportunities to gain power over their rivals, with hegemony as their
final goal]{.underline}. This perspective does not allow for status quo
powers, except for the unusual state that achieves preponderance.
Instead, [the system is populated with great powers that have
revisionist intentions at their core]{.underline}. This chapter presents
a theory that explains this competition for power. Specifically, I
attempt to show that there is a compelling logic behind my claim that
[great powers seek to maximize their share of world power.]{.underline}
. .Why states pursue power My explanation for why g[reat powers vie with
each other for power and strive for hegemony]{.underline} is derived
from five assumptions about the international system. None of these
assumptions alone mandates that states behave competitively. Taken
together, however, they depict a world in which states have considerable
reason to think and sometimes behave aggressively. In particular, [the
system encourages states to look for opportunities to maximize their
power vis-à-vis other states]{.underline}. . . Bedrock assumptions [The
first assumption is that the international system is
anarchic]{.underline}, [which does not mean that it is chaotic or riven
by disorder.]{.underline} It is easy to draw that conclusion, since
[realism depicts a world characterized by security competition and
war.]{.underline} By itself, however, t[he realist notion of anarchy has
nothing to do with conflict; it is an ordering principle, which says
that the system comprises independent states that have no central
authority above them]{.underline}.2 [Sovereignty]{.underline}, in other
words, [inheres in states because there is no higher ruling body in the
international system]{.underline}. 3 [There is no \"government over
governments]{.underline}.\"4 [The second assumption is that great powers
inherently possess some offensive military capability, which gives them
the wherewithal to hurt and possibly destroy each other.]{.underline}
**[States are potentially dangerous to each other]{.underline}**,
[although some states have more military might than others and are
therefore more dangerous]{.underline}. A state\'s military power is
usually identified with the particular weaponry at its disposal,
although even if there were no weapons, the individuals in those states
could still use their feet and hands to attack the population of another
state. After all, **[for every neck, there are two hands to choke
it]{.underline}**. The third assumption is that [states can never be
certain about other states\' intentions]{.underline}. Specifically, [no
state can be sure that another state will not use its offensive military
capability to attack the first state]{.underline}. [This is not to say
that states necessarily have hostile intentions]{.underline}. Indeed,
[all of the states in the system may be reliably benign, but it is
impossible to be sure of that judgment because intentions are impossible
to divine with 100 percent certainty]{.underline}. 5 [There are many
possible causes of aggression, and no state can be sure that another
state is not motivated by one of them.]{.underline} 6 Furthermore,
[intentions can change quickly, so a state \'s intentions can be benign
one day and hostile the next]{.underline}. Uncertainty about intentions
is unavoidable, which means that states can never be sure that other
states do not have offensive intentions to go along with their offensive
capabilities. The fourth assumption is **[that survival is the primary
goal of great powers.]{.underline}** Specifically **[states seek to
maintain their territorial integrity and the autonomy of their domestic
political \... order.]{.underline}** [Survival dominates other motives
because, once a state is conquered, it is unlikely t be in a position to
pursue other aims]{.underline}. Soviet leader Josef Stalin put the point
well during a war scare in 1927: \"We [can and must build socialism in
the \[Soviet Union\]. But in order lv do so we first of all have to
exist]{.underline}.\"7 [States can and do pursue other goals, of course,
but security is their most important objective.]{.underline} The fifth
assumption is that [great powers are rational actors]{.underline}. [They
are aware of their external environment and they think strategically
about how to survive in it.]{.underline} In particular. [they consider
the preferences of other states and how their own behavior is likely to
affect the behavior of those other states]{.underline}, [and how the
behavior of those other states is likely to affect their own strategy
for survival.]{.underline} Moreover, [states pay attention to the long
term as well as the immediate consequences of their
actions.]{.underline} As emphasized, none of these assumptions alone
dictates that great powers as a general rule should behave aggressively
toward each other. [There is surely the possibility that some state
might have hostile intentions]{.underline}, but [the only assumption
dealing with a specific motive that is common to all states says that
their principal objective is to survive]{.underline}, which by itself is
a rather harmless goal. Nevertheless, [when the five assumptions are
married together. They create powerful incentives for great powers to
think and act offensively with regard t each other. In particular,
**three general patterns of behavior result: fear, self-help, and power
maximization.**]{.underline}

[The concept of hegemony is a crucial factor in world affairs and has
been discussed ever since ancient times.]{.underline} However, it became
popular when Italian political theorist Antonio Gramsci used the term in
explaining Italy‟s political impasse following fascism penetrating the
governance. While Gramsci defined hegemony at the state level, Robert W.
Cox adapted it to global politics, by explaining the nature and
implementations of hegemonic order. Conceptualizing hegemony from a
neo-Gramscian perspective, [Cox defines hegemony in a wider context by
emphasizing the ties among society, economy, culture, gender and
ideology that determine the future of political rule.]{.underline} 1
According to him, [hegemony arises on the basis of consent, which means
the adoption of thoughts and their support through material resources
and institutions]{.underline}. In [this perspective, the two pillars of
hegemony **are material capabilities** and a set of institutions that
act in harmony with each other]{.underline}. 2 Although various
International Relations theories consider hegemony from different point
of views, most of them agree that if the hegemon does not act in
accordance with the hegemonic order, its power maybe challenged, making
its decline or collapse possible. [In general, the rise of the United
States (the US) as a hegemon since WWI, but especially after WWII, using
both consent and coercion hegemonic elements helps us to make sense of
world politics.]{.underline} However, since the coercive side of US
hegemony seems to have been more dominant in determining its
international relations, it raises questions about the future of such
hegemony. [It is assumed that the hegemon cannot survive only by relying
on pure military power]{.underline}.3 Rather, a stable hegemonic order
requires the consent of other states in the system. [Comparison of the
consent and coercion elements of hegemony in the world order gives hints
regarding the stability or instability of the system. Üstüntağ ve
Atmaca - **The US Bases and Their Contributions to US Hegemony Since the
system is determined by the hegemon‟s moves and attitudes**, any changes
in the consent-coercion balance is deeply felt by other
states.]{.underline} The main aim of the study is to understand the
mechanism of hegemonic order and the US‟ implementation of it as a way
to control world affairs through overseas bases, besides the changing
position of US hegemony. [There is a particular focus on the hegemon‟s
coercive power to discuss its reasons and results. A cause and effect
relationship in the hegemon‟s behaviors emerges as the defining factor
in the hegemonic orde]{.underline}r. [Regarding the scopes and limits of
the study; political, economic and humanitarian dimensions of these
military bases are not closely examined since the main discussion is
about the military dimension of the US bases and their contributions to

[The twentieth century should have taught the citizens of liberal
democracies the catastrophic consequences of placating
tyrants.]{.underline} British and French restraint over the occupation
of the Rhineland, the Anschluss, the absorption of the Czech
Sudetenland, and the incorporation of Bohemia and Moravia did not win
gratitude but rather Hitler's contempt for their weakness. Fifty million
dead, the Holocaust, and the near destruction of European civilization
were the wages of "appeasement"---a term that early-1930s liberals
proudly embraced as far more enlightened than the old idea of
"deterrence" and "military readiness." [So too did Western excuses for
the Russians' violation of guarantees of free elections in postwar
Eastern Europe, China, and Southeast Asia only embolden the Soviet
Union. What eventually contained Stalinism was the Truman Doctrine,
NATO, and nuclear deterrence---not the United Nations---and what
destroyed its legacy **was Ronald Reagan's assertiveness**, not Jimmy
Carter's accommodation or Richard Nixon's détente.]{.underline} As long
ago as the fourth century b.c., Demosthenes warned how complacency and
self-delusion among an affluent and free Athenian people allowed a
Macedonian thug like Philip II to end some four centuries of Greek
liberty---and in a mere 20 years of creeping aggrandizement down the
Greek peninsula. Thereafter, these historical lessons should have been
clear to citizens of any liberal society: we must neither presume that
comfort and security are our birthrights and are guaranteed without
constant sacrifice and vigilance, nor expect that peoples outside the
purview of bourgeois liberalism share our commitment to reason,
tolerance, and enlightened self-interest. [Most important, military
deterrence and the willingness to use force against evil in its infancy
usually end up, in the terrible arithmetic of war, **saving more lives
than they cost**]{.underline}. [All this can be a hard lesson to relearn
each generation, especially now that we contend with the sirens of the
mall, Oprah, and latte. Our affluence and leisure are as antithetical to
the use of force as rural life and relative poverty once were catalysts
for muscular action]{.underline}. The [age-old lure of
appeasement---perhaps they will cease with this latest concession,
perhaps we provoked our enemies, perhaps demonstrations of our future
good intentions will win their approval---was never more evident than in
the recent Spanish elections, when an affluent European electorate,
reeling from the horrific terrorist attack of 3/11, swept from power the
pro-U.S. center-right government on the grounds that the mass murders
were more the fault of the United States for dragging Spain into the
effort to remove fascists and implant democracy in Iraq than of the
primordial al-Qaidist culprits, who long ago promised the Western and
Christian Iberians ruin for the Crusades and the
Reconquista.]{.underline}

The eight years of the Obama presidency have offered us a natural
experiment of sorts. Not all U.S. presidents are similar on foreign
policy, and not all (or any) U.S. presidents are quite like Barack
Obama. After two terms of George W. Bush's aggressive militarism, we
have had the opportunity to watch whether attitudes toward the
U.S.---and U.S. military force---would change, if circumstances changed.
President Obama shared at least some of the assumptions of both the hard
Left and foreign-policy realists, that the use of direct U.S. military
force abroad, even with the best of intentions, often does more harm
then good. Better, then, to "do no harm." This has been Barack
[Obama's]{.underline} position on the Syrian Civil War, the key
foreign-policy debate of our time. The president's [discomfort with
military action against the Syrian regime seems]{.underline} deep and
instinctual and [oblivious to changing facts on the ground.]{.underline}
[When the debate over intervention began, around 5,000 Syrians had been
killed. Now it's close to 500,000]{.underline}. [Yet, Obama's basic
orientation toward the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has remained
unchanged. This suggests that]{.underline} Obama, like
[many]{.underline} others [who oppose U.S. intervention against
Assad]{.underline}, is [do]{.underline}ing [so on]{.underline}
"principled" or, to put it differently, [ideological
grounds]{.underline}. Despite President Obama's very conscious desire to
limit America's role in the Middle East and to minimize the extent to
which U.S. military assets are deployed in the region, there is little
evidence that the views of the hard Left and other critics of American
power have changed as a result. (Yes, the U.S. military is arguably
involved in more countries now than when the Obama administration took
office, but---compared to Iraq and Afghanistan before him---Obama's
footprint has been decidedly limited, with a reliance on drone strikes
and special-operations forces.) [As for those who actually live in the
Middle East, a less militaristic America has done little to temper
anti-Americanism.]{.underline} In the three countries---Egypt, Jordan,
and Lebanon---for which Pew has survey data for both Bush's last year
and either 2014 or 2015, favorability toward the U.S. is significantly
worse under Obama today than it was in 2008. Why exactly is up for
debate, but we can at the very least say that a drastic drawdown of U.S.
military personnel---precisely the policy pushed for by Democrats in the
wake of Iraq's failure---does not seem to have bought America much
goodwill. [Despite the fact that Assad and Russia are responsible for
indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian
infrastructure]{.underline}, including hospitals, many [leftists have
viewed even the mere mention of the U.S. doing anything in response as
"warmongering."]{.underline} We have had the unfortunate situation of
someone as (formerly) well-respected as Jeffrey Sachs arguing that the
U.S. should provide "air cover and logistical support" to Bashar
al-Assad. We have had Wikileaks' attacks on the White Helmets, who have
risked---and, for at least 140, lost---their lives in the worst
conditions to save Syrian lives from the rubble of Syrian and Russian
bombardment. Of course, it is not an absurd position to be skeptical of
any proposed American escalation against Assad, and many reasonable
people across the political spectrum have made that case. But it is
something else entirely to apply such skepticism selectively to the U.S.
and not to others, especially when the others in question deliberately
target civilians as a matter of policy. It can be a slippery slope.
While no one would accuse Obama of liking Putin, coordinating with and
enabling Russia in Syria is effectively U.S. policy. As the New York
Times columnist Roger Cohen noted in February, well before the current
disaster in Aleppo: "The troubling thing is that the Putin policy on
Syria has become hard to distinguish from the Obama policy." The Left
has always had a utopian bent, believing that life, not just for
Americans, but for millions abroad, can be made better through human
agency (rather than, say, simply hoping that the market will
self-correct). The problem, though, is that the better, more just world
that so many hope for is simply impossible without the use of American
military force. At first blush, such a claim might seem self-evidently
absurd. Haven't we all seen what happened in Iraq? The 2003 Iraq
invasion was one of the worst strategic blunders in the history of U.S.
foreign policy. Yet, it's not clear what exactly this has to do with the
Syrian conflict, which is almost the inverse of the Iraq war. In Iraq,
civil war happened after the U.S. invasion. In Syria, civil war broke
out in the absence of U.S. intervention. What all of this suggests is
that [attitudes toward the U.S. military, and by extension the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[, are often "inelastic,"
meaning that what the U.S. actually does or doesn't do abroad has
limited bearing on perceptions of American power.]{.underline} As a
general proposition, many leftists, for example, seem to believe that
there is something intrinsically wrong with the use of military force by
the United States. In other words, when America does it, it is a bad
thing, irrespective of the outcomes it produces, and therefore should be
opposed outright. There is rarely any real effort to explain why it's
bad---after all, if it were purely a moral stand against the killing of
innocents, the use of Russian or Syrian military force would have to be
considered much worse. But, **[for the use of American power abroad to
be intrinsically wrong or immoral, all uses of military force would have
to be either immoral or ineffective, or both.]{.underline}** However, as
a factual matter, [this is simply not the case]{.underline}. [There was
no way to stop mass slaughter and genocide in Bosnia or Kosovo without
U.S. military force]{.underline}, buttressed, as it should be, by broad
regional or international consensus. In those two cases, a U.S.-led
coalition acted. [In those cases where the international community did
not act, genocide did, in fact, occur, as we witnessed in
Rwanda]{.underline}. What became clear then---and what has become clear
once again in Syria---is that a world where others than the U.S. take
the initiative to stop such slaughter does not exist, and is unlikely to
exist at any point in the foreseeable future. While they may be less
common, there are also cases where dictators will not only kill their
own people but try to forcefully invade and conquer their neighbors. [As
in the first Gulf War]{.underline}, the gobbling up of [Kuwait could not
have been prevented without a U.S.-led coalition]{.underline}, again
with broad international support. The list goes on. From a moral
standpoint, no one should have to suffer under the indignities of ISIS
rule. From a strategic standpoint, having an extremist state the size of
Indiana in the middle of the Middle East, needless to say, does not
suggest the coming of a better, more secure world. While Obama was late
to act against the organization and while the anti-ISIS campaign has
been deeply flawed, the amount of territory that ISIS controls has been
reduced significantly, due in large part to U.S. airstrikes,
intelligence, and special-operations forces. [No one, not Turkey, Saudi
Arabia, or anyone else, was going to seriously confront ISIS without
U.S. coordination and leadership]{.underline}, and it's U.S.
coordination and leadership that is facilitating the current battle for
the Islamic State's Iraqi stronghold in Mosul. This is the faulty---and
ultimately quite dangerous---premise behind one of the founding
assumptions of Obama's foreign policy: that if the U.S. steps back,
others will step in. Even when "others" do step in, the results are
often destructive, since America's allies and adversaries alike do not
generally share its values, interests, or objectives. Of course, U.S.
military force may be necessary, but it can never be sufficient on its
own. This is where the judgment, morality, and strategic vision of
politicians and policymakers can make the crucial difference. The United
States has not been the "force for good" that many Americans would like
to think it's been. There is a tragic history of intervention abroad
that more Americans should be aware of, whether it's overthrowing
democratically elected leaders in Latin America or backing brutal
dictators in the Middle East. There is no reason to think the U.S. is
necessarily doomed to repeat those mistakes indefinitely. But even if it
was, **[there would still be instances where only U.S. military force
could be counted on to stop genocide.]{.underline}** The alternative to
a proactive and internationalist U.S. policy is to "do no harm," and
this might seem a safe fallback position: Foreign countries and cultures
are too complicated to understand, so instead of trying to understand
them, let's at least not make the situation worse. The idea that the
U.S. can "do no harm," however, depends on the fiction that the most
powerful nation in the world can ever be truly "neutral" in foreign
conflicts, not just when it acts, but also when it doesn't. Neutrality,
or silence, is often complicity, something that was once the moral,
urgent claim of the Left. The fiction of neutrality is growing more
dangerous, as we enter a period of resurgent authoritarianism,
anti-refugee incitement, and routine mass killing. This is the built-in
contradiction of what might be called the "anti-imperialist Left." They
are against empire, and there is only one country powerful enough to
reasonably be considered "imperial." (Russia, of course, engages in
bloody imperial ventures, but it gets a pass since it is acting against
the United States.) But to insist that the fundamental problem in
today's world is American imperialism is to have only the most outdated
"principles"---principles that, in the case of Syria, Rwanda, Bosnia,
Kosovo, and even Libya, have left, or would have left, the most
vulnerable and suffering without any recourse to safety and protection.
If the United States announced tomorrow morning that it would no longer
use its military for anything but to defend the borders of the homeland,
many would instinctively cheer, perhaps not quite realizing what this
would mean in practice. But that is the conundrum the Left is now
facing. [A world without mass slaughter]{.underline}, of the sort of we
are seeing every day in Syria, [cannot ever come to be without American
power.]{.underline} But perhaps this will prove one of the positive
legacies of the Obama era: showing that the alternative of American
disinterest and disengagement is not necessarily better. For those,
though, that care about ideology---holding on to the idea that U.S.
military force is somehow inherently bad---more than they care about
actual human outcomes, the untenability of their position will persist.
That, too, will be a tragedy, since at a time when many on the Right are
turning jingoistic or isolationist, there is a need for voices that not
just believe in U.S. power, but believe that that power---still, for
now, preeminent---can be used for better, more moral ends.

#### Military intervention solves venezuelan abuse

[Venezuela faces an economic crisis, high crime rates and ongoing
protests against President Nicolás Maduro. And now Republican Senator
Marco Rubio of Florida has suggested a U.S. military
intervention]{.underline}. In an interview with Univision 23 in Miami
earlier this week translated from Spanish to English, Rubio, a vocal
opponent of Maduro\'s regime, said he would not rule the military option
out. [\"For months and years, I wanted the solution in Venezuela to be a
non-military and peaceful solution, simply to restore
democracy,\"]{.underline} Rubio said. [\"I believe that the Armed Forces
of the United States are only used in the event of a threat to national
security**. I believe that there is a very strong argument that can be
made at this time that Venezuela and the Maduro regime has become a
threat to the region and even to the United States**.\" But critics of
U.S. military action say it\'s a bad idea]{.underline}. A better
solution would be a \"multilateral solution that involves some kind of
negotiations,\" said Juan Cruz, a CIA veteran and director for Western
Hemisphere Affairs at the National Security Council. Geoff Ramsey, the
assistant director for Advocacy for Human Rights in the Americas\'
Venezuela program, otherwise known as WOLA, told Newsweek that even
threatening military action as a solution to a complex crisis is not the
answer. He believed Rubio is likely speaking to a select constituent
base in Miami and that U.S. aid to Venezuela needs to focus on
negotiated solutions. [\"Threatening military action risks derailing
diplomatic progress and spreads false hope among the extremist voices in
the Venezuelan opposition that they don\'t have to do the hard work of
building a coalition and leadership structure,\" Ramsey said. \"They
think the U.S. will invade and deliver the country on a silver platter.
It\'s a fantasy.\"]{.underline} Rubio\'s office did not immediately
respond on Saturday to a request for comment from Newsweek about the
ongoing Venezuelan crisis. Rubio has been a longtime critic of the
Venezuelan government. [\"Venezuela was a democracy with a constitution,
and a national assembly and a court,\"]{.underline} Rubio said in May.
\"[All of that\'s been wiped out by a dictator. Every day it gets worse
and worse, right here in our own hemisphere.\" They are sponsoring and
protecting narco traffickers. They are flooding their neighboring
countries, including Colombia, with refugees and people seeking refuge
from Venezuela.\"]{.underline} Maduro, an authoritarian leader who many
compare, in style at least, to Donald Trump, has presided over an
economic crisis. The International Monetary Fund projected in July that
inflation would hit one million percent this year. The economy crashed
in 2014 after the price of oil left the country struggling to subsidize
the price of bare necessities for its people. Items like toilet paper,
tomatoes and chicken were placed in front of bolivars, the currency used
in Venezuela, to represent the current inflation crisis. Just days after
the IMF\'s projection of record inflation rates, the government knocked
five zeros off the end of its currency. [\"The idea that the Venezuelan
crisis is a national security threat is not a position shared by the
majority of Venezuelans or even among leaders of the Venezuelan
opposition itself,\" Ramsey said. \"The solution needs to be some
combination of the current international strategy of pairing
multilateral pressure on the Venezuelan government through sanctions ...
**paired with engagement that leads to fair elections.\"**]{.underline}

### Heg Solves the Environment

#### Hegemony key to environmental protections. 

**Falkner 5** -- Dept. IR @ London School of Economics, Robert,
"American Hegemony and the Global Environment", International Studies
Review (2005) 7, 585--599

The ﬁrst use of hegemony in international environmental politics
revolves around the use of superior power in the interest of
international regime building. Young (1989:88) has argued in
International Cooperation: Building Regimes for Natural Re- sources and
the Environment that, even though **[hegemonic states]{.underline}**
rarely impose in- ternational regimes against the wishes of other
states, they **[play an important role in providing leadership in the
creation of mutually agreeable environmental regimes]{.underline}**.
Although environmental leadership does not necessarily result from
hegemonic power, it is closely linked to such power. [**Environmental
leadership can take many different forms**: policy entrepreneurship of
individual actors in international bar- gaining that facilitates
compromise and agreement in the interest of environmental
causes]{.underline} (entrepreneurial leadership); [**diffusion and role
model effects of national environmental policy**]{.underline}
(intellectual leadership); [and the more explicit use of eco- nomic
incentives and sanctions in pursuit of international environmental
objectives]{.underline} (structural leadership) (Young 1991; Lake 1993;
Vogel 1997; Tews 2004). Even though hegemony is neither a necessary nor
sufﬁcient condition for the existence of environmental leadership, [it
is usually only powerful states that have a lasting effect on
international negotiations and norm creation. Weaker states may assume a
leading position when it comes to developing progressive environmental
policies or demanding stringent international rules. But such
initiatives will remain ineffective if they are not backed up by
political and economic clout that can foster international agreement and
induce compliance.]{.underline} For example, smaller European states
such as Denmark and the Netherlands have often been in the vanguard of
environmental policy innovation, but Germany, Europe's largest economy,
is usu- ally credited with providing the essential leadership for
advancing environmental policies at the EU level. A similar picture
emerges in the international system. It is mainly states that have
dominant economic and political clout and whose position in the
international economy affords them the possibility of exerting indirect
or direct pressure on other states that can provide effective leadership
on environmental issues. The United States is a good example of this
conclusion. [**For much of the early phase of international
environmental politics, the United States provided inter- national
leadership in one form or the other**. It was one of the ﬁrst leading
in- dustrialized nations to develop comprehensive environmental
legislation and reg- ulatory institutions.]{.underline} The US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which was set up in 1970 to
integrate the widely scattered programs and institutions dealing with
environmental matters, instantly became a model for similar regulatory
agencies that were created in other industrialized countries during the
1970s. Much of this state activity was underpinned by the world's most
dynamic environmental move- ment, which came into existence in the
mid-1960s. US environmental groups ranging from the more traditional
bodies (Sierra Club, National Audubon Society) to modern environmental
nongovernmental organizations (Environmental Defense Fund, Natural
Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace) worked to create broadly based
domestic support for a more ambitious environmental policy at home and
abroad. US scientists and activists came to play a leading role in the
global envi- ronmental movement that began to emerge in the 1970s (Kraft
2004). [At the international level, the United States began to claim the
mantle of en- vironmental leader,]{.underline} ﬁrst at the UN Conference
on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972 (Hopgood 1998:96), and
later in the context of the multilateral efforts to agree on
environmental treaties. Having declared eight whale species endangered
based on the Endangered Species Act of 1969, [the United States took up
the issue of whale preservation internationally]{.underline} and
initiated a transformation of the international whaling regime to
emphasize species protection rather than nat- ural resource usage. [US
diplomatic pressure and threat of sanctions were instrumental in getting
the International Whaling Commission to place a ban on commercial
whaling in 1984]{.underline} (Porter and Brown 1996:77--81; Fletcher
2001). [Also in the 1970s, the United States began to support
international efforts to take action against ozone layer depletion and
in the 1980s became a key advocate of international restrictions on the
use of ozone-depleting chemicals.]{.underline} During the ne- gotiations
on the Montreal Protocol, the US government provided important lead-
ership and exerted pressure on skeptical states, especially the European
producers of ozone-depleting substances, that objected to strong
international measures (Benedick 1991). Whereas the ozone negotiations
provided the United States with an opportunity to display leadership in
a multilateral context, US policy on the conservation of species took on
a more unilateral character. **[More than any other country, the United
States has used the threat of sanctions to change other nations'
behavior in areas that endanger threatened species. Using import
restrictions on products made in an environmentally damaging way, the US
government forced foreign ﬁshing ﬂeets to comply with American standards
of protection of, for ex- ample, dolphins and sea turtles]{.underline}**
(DeSombre 2001).

### AT: Heg Decline Inevitable

#### Decline isn't inevitable\-\--hegemony is sustainable and solves great power war

**Petraeus, 17** - former director of the Central Intelligence Agency
and former head of CENTCOM (David, \"America Must Stand Tall,\"
*Politico Magazine*, 2-7-2017,
http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/02/america-stand-tall-214748)

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [came of age as a world
power amid]{.underline} the [rubble left by]{.underline} this
[succession of calamities]{.underline}---[and resolved]{.underline}, [in
the wake of the most devastating conflict the world has ever
known]{.underline}, to try [to prevent them from ever happening
again]{.underline}. [To keep the peace]{.underline}, [we led an effort
to establish a system of **global alliances**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[security commitments]{.underline}**, [underwritten
by **U.S. military power** and the deployment of our forces to bases in
Europe and Asia]{.underline}. [To create a foundation for
prosperity]{.underline}, [we put in place]{.underline} an
[open]{.underline}, [free]{.underline} [and rules-based international
economic order]{.underline} intended [to safeguard against]{.underline}
the spiral of **[protectionism]{.underline}** [that
produced]{.underline} the [impoverishment and
radicalization]{.underline} of the 1930s. And to protect freedom here at
home, [we]{.underline} adopted a foreign policy that [sought to protect
and]{.underline}, where possible, [promote freedom abroad]{.underline},
along with human rights and rule of law. These were the bipartisan
foundations for the international order that emerged after World War II.
They were the product of American leadership, American power and
American values. And while imperfect, [on balance they
**succeeded**]{.underline}. [The extent of that success can be
seen]{.underline} when we compare the first half of the 20th century
[with]{.underline} [the second half of that century]{.underline}---a
period that [witnessed the **longest stretch without a great-power war**
in centuries]{.underline}; [the most dramatic expansion of human
prosperity in history]{.underline}; [and the spread of democracy to
every inhabited continent on the planet]{.underline}. To borrow a phrase
[from]{.underline} the historian **[Robert Kagan]{.underline}**, [this
is the world that America made]{.underline}. [I]{.underline}t is also
the world that, I fear, is now in danger of being unmade. [The
international order]{.underline} that America created [is]{.underline}
now [under **unprecedented threat**]{.underline} [from multiple
directions]{.underline}, [including by increasingly capable
**revisionist powers**]{.underline}---that is, countries dissatisfied
with the status quo, by [**Islamic extremist**
organizations]{.underline} that want to destroy our way of life,
[and]{.underline} by [**technologies and tactics** that are reducing
America's capacity to defend ourselves and our interests]{.underline}.
As important as those various threats are, however, [the world order
has]{.underline} also [been undermined by]{.underline} something perhaps
even more pernicious---a [loss of self-confidence]{.underline},
**[resolve]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[strategic
clarity]{.underline}** [on America's part about our vital interest in
preserving and protecting the system]{.underline} we sacrificed so much
to bring into being and have sacrificed so much to preserve. [The major
challenge]{.underline} to the U.S.-led international order---[the rise
of a set of **revisionist powers**]{.underline}---is a development
Americans have recognized but been reluctant to confront. Since the end
of the Cold War, our hopeful assumption has been that mutual
self-interest could provide a pathway for deepening partnership among
the major powers, while globalization would gradually liberalize the
internal politics of all countries. What we have seen instead,
unfortunately, is that, [as certain countries have grown more
powerful]{.underline}, [so]{.underline} too [has their desire to
challenge]{.underline} at least some elements of [the status
quo]{.underline}, while domestically, their authoritarianism has grown
both more entrenched and yet also more insecure. In particular, we see
several countries---including **[China]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**---now
[working to establish a]{.underline} kind of [sphere of influence
over]{.underline} their respective [near-abroads]{.underline}, [which
include areas of vital **strategic importance**]{.underline} [to the
U.S]{.underline}., and where we have [allies]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [partners]{.underline} to whom we are bound by shared
interests and values. To be sure, [each of the revisionist powers
requires a very different approach on America's part]{.underline}.
[China]{.underline}, for example, [is not just a rising great power and
strategic competitor]{.underline}; [it is]{.underline} also [our No. 1
trading partner]{.underline}, and our relationship with it is the most
important relationship in the world. In fact, in each case our
relationship inevitably combines some aspects of intensifying rivalry
with other aspects of shared interest, including the need to develop
some concept of mutual restraint and respect. [The challenge for the
U.S. is to find the often elusive
**equilibrium**]{.underline}---[something]{.underline} that is [likely
to occur only if we combine **hard-headed diplomacy** with an equally
hard-headed reinvestment in shoring up]{.underline} what has been [a
**deteriorating balance of power**]{.underline}. A very different, far
more radical revisionist force threatening the international order is
Islamic extremism---the ideology that animates the Islamic State and Al
Qaeda. The greatest weakness of Islamic extremism is also its greatest
strength---which is its protean ability to exist and indeed thrive
without inhabiting a conventional nation-state. What it lacks in
traditional power terms, it compensates for in conviction, resilience,
resourcefulness and ferocity. And in its hydra-like qualities, it is
unlike any adversary we have faced before. What is still missing in many
cases is a truly comprehensive approach to combating these extremists,
though, to be fair, there has been progress in recent years developing
an approach that enables local partners and allows us to achieve a
sustainable strategy---with sustainability being measured in blood and
treasure, and being an essential quality given the likely duration of
the struggle in which we are engaged. The [defeat of Islamic
extremist]{.underline} [groups]{.underline} does, of course, [require a
**vital** military component]{.underline}. But [even if we succeed
militarily]{.underline}, as I believe we will, in metaphorically putting
a stake through the heart of ISIS and its allies in Iraq and Syria, that
[success will be fleeting unless the underlying conflicts in those
countries and the greater Middle East that enabled ISIS' rise are
addressed and resolved]{.underline}. We must also recognize that
long-term success in this conflict requires that the ideology of Islamic
extremism is itself discredited. And contending with the ideological
caliphate in cyberspace will undoubtedly prove more challenging than
taking away the rest of what is now a shrinking physical caliphate on
the ground in Iraq and Syria. Here I should note that [our most
important ally in this war is]{.underline} the overwhelming [majority of
Muslims who reject Al Qaeda]{.underline}, [ISIS]{.underline} [and their
fanatical]{.underline}, [barbaric worldview]{.underline}. Indeed, it is
millions of Muslims who are fighting and dying in the greatest numbers
on the front lines of this war---including Arab and Kurdish fighters
bravely battling ISIS in Mosul; Gulf Arab forces taking the fight to Al
Qaeda's franchise in Yemen; Afghans courageously struggling against a
resurgent Taliban and a nascent Islamic State affiliate; Somali forces
confronting Al Shabab; and the Libyan elements that recently drove
another Islamic State entity from the enclave it had seized on the North
African coast. We must also remember that Islamic extremists want to
portray this fight as a clash of civilizations, with America at war
against Islam. We must not let them do that; indeed, we must be very
sensitive to actions that might give them ammunition to use in such an
effort. [Compounding the danger posed by revisionist forces are
**technologies** that are **eroding America's conventional military
edge**]{.underline}. In this respect, the wars of the post-9/11 period
were, in some respects, a preview of the future. While the U.S. deployed
forces into Iraq and Afghanistan that were superbly constructed for
rapid decisive operations of the kind that we waged during the Gulf War
in 1991, our adversaries responded with strategies that, for a fraction
of the cost, nullified many of our advantages. What Islamic extremists
demonstrated through insurgency and terrorism, [revisionist powers like
China]{.underline}, [Iran]{.underline} [and Russia]{.underline} [promise
to take to a whole new level of sophistication]{.underline}.
[Among]{.underline} the [fast-developing tools]{.underline} in their
arsenals [are]{.underline} **[anti-access area denial]{.underline}**
[weapons]{.underline} [that]{.underline} will [complicate our ability to
project power into vital regions and uphold]{.underline} our [security
commitments]{.underline}; [increasingly complex]{.underline}
**[cyberweapons]{.underline}** for employment alone in attacks on
infrastructure or in influence campaigns, or in supporting conventional
and unconventional force operations, including so-called hybrid warfare;
a **[renewed emphasis on nuclear weapons]{.underline}**; [and **threats
to U.S. primacy in space**]{.underline}---[a vital sanctuary for U.S.
military power]{.underline} that is increasingly contested. [These are
all serious threats]{.underline}. **[Despite these
challenges]{.underline}**, I believe [America is in a **commanding
position**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[sustain]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} indeed [bolster the international order that has
served us]{.underline}---[and]{.underline}, paradoxically, some of
[those seeking to change it]{.underline}---so well. [We have an
extraordinary network of partners who are stakeholders in the current
order and can be mobilized far more effectively in its
defense]{.underline}. [Our economy remains the largest in the world and
an engine of unsurpassed innovation]{.underline}. And as a result of
America's values---political pluralism, rule of law, a free and open
society---[we can recruit the best and the brightest from every corner
of the planet]{.underline}, [a strategic advantage that none of our
competitors can match]{.underline}. The paradox of the moment is that,
just as the threats to the world order we created have grown ever more
apparent, [American resolve about its defense has become]{.underline}
somewhat **[ambivalent]{.underline}**.

It was nearly 52 years ago, [on March 8, 1965]{.underline}, that [the
first American combat battalions came ashore at]{.underline} Da Nang,
[South Vietnam.]{.underline} [In the subsequent six months, the US
government took the worst strategic decision of modern
times]{.underline}: [the decision to escalate]{.underline} that
[military commitment]{.underline} just [enough to entangle the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [in the war]{.underline}
between North and South Vietnam, [but]{.underline} [not enough to win
it]{.underline}. Half a century later, [American society still bears the
scars of Vietnam.]{.underline} Visit any major American campus and you
will encounter a new generation of student revolutionaries,
self-consciously imitating the mannerisms of the antiwar movement of the
late '60s: denouncing the president as a fascist and the police as pigs,
desperately hoping their next sit-in or riot will make the evening news.
[For]{.underline} both generations --- [the baby boomers]{.underline},
who long ago cut their hair and became management consultants, [and the
social justice warriors of today]{.underline} --- [there are few things
more petrifying than the spectacle of generals in the
government.]{.underline} They despise Donald J. Trump, who they insist
is "not our president." But [they fear the men in uniform.]{.underline}
Should the rest of us be worried that three key posts in the Trump
administration are now held by military men? General James Mattis is
secretary of defense, despite having retired only recently as the
general in charge of Central Command. General John F. Kelly is secretary
of Homeland Security, having previously run Southern Command. Lieutenant
General H.R. McMaster was, until his appointment as national security
adviser last Monday, number two at the Army Training and Doctrine
Command[. It has been a very long time indeed since career
soldiers]{.underline} (as opposed to civilians who had served their
country in time of war**)** [held this many top-level government
jobs.]{.underline} Certainly, my former colleagues at Harvard --- who
essentially believe that the executive branch should be staffed
exclusively by professors --- look askance at the Trump administration.
Some mutter the word "junta" under their breath. Others draw parallels
with the fall of the Roman republic. Almost exactly a year ago, when a
Trump presidency still seemed like a joke, this newspaper ran a spoof
front page --- dated April 17, 2017 --- with the lead "Deportations To
Begin." Now the deportations have begun, and President Trump seemed to
relish the thought, saying last week that they would be a "military"
operation. Harvard Yard echoes with the sound of heads exploding. Yet
the [civilians need to be reminded of what really happened back in
1965.]{.underline} For the disastrous decisions to escalate in Vietnam
were taken against the advice of the generals. [The biggest blunder in
modern American history was the work of Lyndon Johnson]{.underline},
arguably [the most politically experienced president of them
all]{.underline}; Robert McNamara, the "whiz kid" former president of
the Ford Motor Company; Dean Rusk, a career diplomat before he ran the
Rockefeller Foundation; and Walt Rostow, an economist from MIT. Indeed,
an outstanding book entitled "Dereliction of Duty'' condemns the joint
chiefs of staff for failing effectively to oppose the civilians'
strategy, which they knew to be fatally flawed. The author of that book?
Step forward, H.R. McMaster, the new national security adviser. The
biggest difference between American soldiers and American civilians is
that the former learned the right lessons from Vietnam. [Men like
Mattis, Kelly, and McMaster belong to the generation that rethought the
American way of war in the wake of that great debacle.]{.underline}
Mattis and Kelly enlisted in the Marines in, respectively, 1969 and
1970. In common with their younger Army comrade McMaster, they are
warrior-scholars, deeply committed to learning from history. I do not
say this lightly: [Never in the history of the English-speaking peoples
has there been an officer class this good.]{.underline} It is not just
that they are smart and knowledgeable. [Seared by the memory of Vietnam,
they have an ethos of selfless public service that is unlike
anything]{.underline} I have ever encountered. Whenever I am succumbing
to gloom about America's political future, I remind myself of the
unexpected legacy of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Though the Obama
administration frittered away the hard-won gains of the later Bush
years, the generation that fought those wars has come back home imbued
with a new spirit. Incorruptible, indefatigable servants of their
country, they have learned the hard way the weaknesses, as well as the
strengths, of a political system that subordinates the military to
civilian authority. [Those who fear rule by generals fail to grasp that
the US Constitution today has no more dependable defenders than these
men. Much else about the Trump administration makes me
worry.]{.underline} The former businessmen, including the president
himself, are struggling to find their feet. [There are conflicts of
interest]{.underline}, contradictory statements, cocked-up executive
orders[, and countless empty offices.]{.underline} [It is the soldiers
who exude competence]{.underline}, just as it is the veterans in
Congress who show backbone. So stand to attention, Harvard. Half a

#### Trump unpredictability creates effective deterrence\-\--forces conflict resolution via negotiations

**Jakobsen, 17** - Associate Professor at the Royal Danish Defence
College and a Professor (part-time) at the Center for War Studies at
University of Southern Denmark (Peter Viggo Jakobsen, \"Doomsday
Cancelled: Trump is Good News for Allies and World Peace,\" *War on the

**[Trump's Unpredictability Deters Rival Risk-Taking]{.underline}**

That Schelling's logic applies equally well to President Trump's
dealings with America's opponents has already been pointed out by other
commentators. They have referred to Nixon's madman theory of
negotiation, which holds that [America's opponents will tread **more
carefully** if they perceive the president to be
**unpredictable**]{.underline} or crazy. It has been debated at some
length whether Trump is using this theory in a rational manner to
extract concessions from U.S. adversaries, or if he is "a madman in
practice." Regardless, the point is that President [Trump's
unpredictability makes it next to **impossible** to calculate the risk
of escalation involved in challenging the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [militarily]{.underline}, a concept also
highlighted by Schelling. President [Obama's reluctance to threaten and
use force]{.underline} likely **[emboldened China]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}** [to take greater military
risks]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [Eastern Ukraine]{.underline},
[Syria]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in **[the East]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[South China Seas]{.underline}**. While [Beijing and
Moscow]{.underline} could be fairly confident that Obama would not take
military counter-measures, they [have no way of knowing
what]{.underline} President [Trump might do]{.underline}. It is very
easy to imagine him giving the order to down a Chinese or Russian plane
to demonstrate that "America is great again."

[In this way]{.underline}, [Trump]{.underline} (intentionally or not)
**[reduces the risk of military confrontations]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} [China and Russia]{.underline}. [This
gives]{.underline} both [states greater incentive to **prioritize
diplomacy**]{.underline} [over]{.underline} **[coercion]{.underline}**
[in their efforts to settle disputes with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its allies. Similarly, [Trump's
characterization of the nuclear agreement with Iran as]{.underline}
"[the worst deal ever negotiated]{.underline}" [gives Tehran strong
incentive to honor it]{.underline} in both letter and spirit [for fear
of a potentially much worse alternative if it collapses.]{.underline}
Some are deeply worried that Trump versus Kim Jong-un will prove a
highly explosive combination, which is understandable since North Korea
has employing the same negotiating tactics as Trump for decades with
considerable success. While the outcome of this confrontation is
difficult to call, the disastrous consequences of war are likely to lead
to mutual restraint. Moreover, concern about what Trump might do will
induce Beijing to redouble its efforts to persuade Pyongyang to be less
provocative.

Good News for World Peace

Paradoxically, [Trump's]{.underline} tweets and the
[theatrics]{.underline} are most likely to [enhance world
peace]{.underline}. [They create unpredictability and anxiety that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can use to obtain greater
concessions from friends and foes]{.underline}. It is admittedly still
early days, but all indications are that Trump will succeed in coercing
his allies in both Asia and Europe to increase their defense spending
significantly. Few of them will reach 2 percent of GDP in the next year
or two, but he has set in motion a process that will make most allies
spend far more much faster than they otherwise would have. His
[unpredictability is]{.underline} also [an asset in America's dealings
with its opponents]{.underline} such as **[China]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, **[North Korea]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}**. [They will all need to think twice about
**provoking**]{.underline} [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and its allies militarily]{.underline} [because]{.underline} [they have
no way of calculating how]{.underline} President [Trump will
react]{.underline}. Neither friends nor foes can be certain that Trump
will not do something that a rational cost-benefit calculating actor
would not. U.S. allies used to regard American threats to withdraw its
forces as bluff because the costs of doing so would be prohibitive, and
the same logic has induced American opponents to engage in military
risk-taking with little fear of U.S. military retaliation. With Trump in
the White House, this logic no longer applies. This is good news because
[the likely result is **strengthened U.S. alliances** and U.S. opponents
that are more likely to **favor negotiation over provocation** in their
efforts to settle differences with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies]{.underline}.

While of course there is poverty in the United States that we should all
work towards reducing, [over time, the overall quality of life of
Americans has drastically improved]{.underline}. This means Americans
need to spend less time doing tasks by hand that they can now afford to
hire a business to do, or can now use technology to accomplish. [Their
minds are less focused on daily survival, and more on broader issues.
This is a positive thing for protecting the environment.]{.underline}
When you aren't concerned about where or how to eat and get clean water
or shelter, [you care more about whether air is of good quality or if
the nearby lake is protected from pollution]{.underline}. But [the
evidence showing that capitalism helps improve environmental
quality]{.underline} is not just clear from history, it is [shines as
clear as day in statistical data as well. Yale University has a metric
called the Environmental Performance Index, which takes statistics on
environmental health and ecosystem vitality to rate a country's
environmental protectio]{.underline}n. James Roberts and Ryan Olson of
the Heritage Foundation took this number and compared it to the Index of
Economic Freedom, which measures how economically free through
capitalism a nation is. [They found a strong trend in the data that
"indicates that as countries move from economic repression to economic
freedom, their environments improve as well."]{.underline} Olson and
Roberts then looked at the state of private property rights in several
countries, and compared that to Yale's Environmental Performance Index.
[They found an incredibly strong correlation in this data, suggesting
that as private property rights increase, so does environmental
protection and quality.]{.underline} The two researchers explain:
"[Because land values usually increase over time, owners have an
incentive to maintain the quality of the land and its improvements in
order to preserve its value. Owners of private property have no interest
in destroying the value of the land or its environmental
qualities,]{.underline} because they would not profit from such
degradation." [In the 1990's, Iceland actually began to experiment with
property rights when it comes to fisheries]{.underline}. It was long
thought that using private property rights on fish or areas of the
ocean, since there is no way to stop fish from swimming to other parts,
was impossible. But [Iceland began using "Individual Transferable
Quotas" which allowed fishermen to "harvest specific portions of the
overall quota of marine fish]{.underline}." If a fisherman was having
less success meeting their part of the quota, they could sell their
rights to other more efficient fishermen, thus creating an incentive to
reward more efficient, successful fishermen. [This helped limit
over-fishing, and over time fish stocks improved, thus increasing
environmental quality.]{.underline} But what about the track record of
communist countries? How do they do at protecting the environment?
[Countries in the European Soviet bloc, as well as the USSR and
Venezuela, do not just fare worse than capitalist countries at
protecting the environment; they do such an awful job at protecting the
environment that it inevitably becomes a humanitarian
crisis.]{.underline}

#### Free markets are key to the economy

**Dorfman, 16** (Jeffrey Dorfman, professor of economics at The
University of Georgia, contributor to Forbes, "Ten Free Market Economic
Reasons To Be Thankful", Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2016/11/23/ten-free-market-economic-reasons-to-be-thankful)//tj
gb

For all the criticism that has been heaped upon free market economics
for the supposed harmful effects of economic inequality, for not
producing the socially desirable outcomes of some social justice
warriors, free market economics has been the most powerful, nonreligious
force for good in the history of the world. [Free market economics has
lifted billions of people worldwide out of poverty in the past two
generations alone. It has brought consumers an embarrassment of riches
worth of product variety. It rewards talented people for talents that
dictators or central planners would never have even thought to
exploit.]{.underline} This column reviews ten great reasons to be very
thankful for the wonders of free market economics. 1. [Median income is
really rising]{.underline} Claims of stagnant middle class wages
generally rely on either the use of very flawed data rather than
official government statistics, or misuse of government statistics. As
the Manhattan Institute's Scott Winship has repeatedly
[[shown]{.underline}](http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/344060/),
properly measured incomes have risen rather steadily with labor
productivity, as would be expected. Using data from the Current
Population Survey and the Congressional Budget Office, Winship shows
that from 1967 to 2009 median household income rose by more than
\$20,000. Given that median income growth was slowly positive since 2009
until growing rapidly in 2015, the \$20,000 gain has increased since
2009, so that when more updated data are released, [the cumulative gain
since 1967 will be more like \$22,000 for the median household. These
rising wages are thanks to a free labor market where employers have to
compete for workers by offering competitive wages. 2. Free trade saves
us trillions]{.underline} While free trade is currently a losing issue
politically, the economic reality is that allowing the free market to
extend past national boundaries allows people in both trading partners
to increase the benefits of free markets. By exploiting more differences
in comparative advantage and the differences in tastes, preferences,
resources, and talents worldwide, [American consumers save hundreds of
billions of dollars per year on the goods we purchase.]{.underline} In
addition, we gain variety in our purchases, such as the ability of buy
fresh fruit in the winter. Yes, some workers may temporarily lose jobs
and see wages rise more slowly thanks to the increased competition trade
brings, but [on average we save much more in lower prices than we lose
in lower wages. 3. Free markets know what we want]{.underline} Free
markets miraculously supply almost all our wants without an obvious
mechanism that lets them know what to make and where to deliver it.
Through the wonder of the infamous invisible hand, [we vote with our
dollars every day by how we spend our money and the market continually
adjusts to meet those needs as efficiently]{.underline} and
inexpensively as possible. The average supermarket, for example,
contains 50,000 different items for sale and has an inventory control
system and supply chain so responsive to consumer demand that on any
given day 99.8 percent or more of those items are there waiting for you
to buy them. [4. Innovators are rewarded, consumers benefit Economic
rewards to innovators encourage businesses to invent things consumers
don't even know we need.]{.underline} Nobody knew she needed an iPhone,
Velcro, Post-It notes, blind-spot warning systems, or fitness trackers
until somebody invented them. More innovations than we can recall proved
to be things that we didn't need and those innovators did not receive an
economic reward. However, the rewards to those who correctly guess the
mood of enough consumers are sufficient to make many of them rich. This
encourages innovation and enriches consumers by much more than any
financial rewards to the innovators themselves. **5**[. Failed
businesses are punished, economic growth accelerated]{.underline}
Economic judgments also put out of business those making things
consumers don't want. This is a benefit of free markets because when a
business disappears it frees up resources to be redeployed to the
production of things society values more highly. This is exactly what
the government frequently gets wrong when it bails out failing
businesses under the mistaken pretext of protecting jobs. Bailing out
failing companies traps resources and capital in a low growth sector
that could have been more profitably used in higher growth areas of the
economy. [In other words, stopping business failures slows down economic
growth; let them die and watch new businesses rise from the ashes. 6.
Free markets match buyers and sellers]{.underline} Free markets
automatically pair up sellers and buyers. In a free market system,
producers rarely have to know, find, or ever meet the sellers of their
products. Retailers stand between producers and consumers. Banks stand
between savers and borrowers. Stockbrokers and real estate agents serve
to match up those who want to sell and buy shares of stock or a piece of
property. [Because some money can be made through performing these
matchmaking services, a free market allows customers to find the
products they want without finding the people making those
products]{.underline}. This greatly lowers the transaction costs for
both buyers and sellers, making markets more efficient. The internet has
only accelerated the benefits gained in this regard, shrinking
transaction costs ever further. [7. Competition keeps prices low
Competition among competing businesses keeps prices low]{.underline}.
Inflation is mostly a problem in the industries with the most government
involvement (e.g., healthcare, education) while industries that have
more free market competition find businesses reluctant to raise prices
and always looking for cost efficiencies to gain an advantage over those
competitors. Just think about prices for computers, food, and clothes to
realize the gains consumers capture from robust competition in a free
market. [8. Price signals work Price signals tell people and businesses
where to allocate their skills and efforts]{.underline}. A nursing
shortage is signaled to the labor market through employers advertising
higher wages for nurses, hopefully leading more people to go into that
profession. [High demand for a popular product will lead businesses to
bid higher to get a share of the limited supply, encouraging producers
to make more.]{.underline} Similarly, falling prices and wages tell
producers and workers what products and fields some of them should
abandon. When you think about how rarely the store is out of the item
you want or has a huge overstock lingering on the shelves for months on
end, you realize how well price signals in a free market work. [9.
Freedom Free markets let you choose what work you want to do, who to
work for, where to shop, what to buy.]{.underline} Without free markets,
some government agency or benevolent dictator would have to match
workers with jobs, producers with retailers, and retailers with
customers. Without free markets, you have no free choice. Thus, when we
restrict free markets with government regulations, people lose freedom:
over what work to do, where and when to shop, what to buy. Free markets,
in contrast to government-controlled ones, let over one hundred million
workers choose from thousands of professions and three hundred million
consumers choose from millions of goods and services for sale every day.
[10. Free markets make things work]{.underline} Think about sectors of
our society where things are not working: many government agencies (like
the DMV), healthcare, transportation systems, and K-12 education, for
example. Those areas are where we have the fewest markets and the most
government intervention. [If you want low prices and high quality, keep
government out of the way and let free markets work.]{.underline}
America's K-12 public education system which has virtually no freedom of
choice consistently [[scores in the
middle-of-the-pack]{.underline}](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/07/us-falls-in-world-education-rankings_n_793185.html)
internationally. Yet, our higher education system, where consumers can
choose the college they want to attend, is universally rated as the
[[best in the
world]{.underline}](http://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings?int=a27a09).
So this year as we gather with family and friends to celebrate
Thanksgiving, give thanks for the food, for family and friends, for all
the things you are truly grateful for. Among those things should be free
economic markets. Because without free markets, much of the rest of what
we are thankful for would be missing.

[No system has been as effective as capitalism in turning scarcity into
abundance.]{.underline} Think of computers. Forty years ago, only
business and government could afford the old massive mainframes. A
single machine filled an entire room. Today the BlackBerry device in the
palm of your hand has even more computing power than those old machines.
[Thanks to capitalism, Americans as a nation are living dramatically
better and longer than they did at the beginning of the twentieth
century.]{.underline} In *The Greatest Century That Ever Was: 25
Miraculous Trends of the Past 100 Years,* noted economist Stephen Moore
and the late business professor Julian Simon make the powerful
observation that since the early twentieth century, [life expectancy has
increased; infant mortality rates have fallen tenfold. Major killer
diseases\--from tuberculosis to polio, typhoid, and pneumonia\--have in
most parts of the world been, if not eradicated, drastically reduced;
agricultural productivity has soared.]{.underline} The environment is
also cleaner in many parts of the world. Air quality has improved about
30 percent in American cities since 1977. Not only that, Moore and Simon
write, \"[the affordability and availability of consumer goods have
greatly increased]{.underline}. Even most poor Americans have a
cornucopia of choices that a century ago the Rockefellers and the
Vanderbilts could not have purchased.\" Until the credit crisis, tens of
millions of people a year worldwide were joining the middle class.
[Between 2003 and 2007, the growth of the American economy alone
*exceeded the size of the entire Chinese economy*]{.underline}*.* We
grew the equivalent of China in four and a half years. China\'s growth
rates are higher\--but they\'re coming from a much smaller base.
[Free-market economic reforms\--especially since the fall of the Berlin
wall\--have brought an unprecedented explosion of wealth to India,
China, Brazil, and nations in central and eastern Europe as well as in
Latin America and Africa. Capitalism has helped to usher in an era of
wealth and economic growth that failed foreign-aid programs since World
War II were never able to accomplish]{.underline}. In China, for
example, over two hundred million people now have discretionary income.
The country has a burgeoning middle class. The current recession should
be seen historically as an interruption, not an end, of this
extraordinary economic expansion. Along with bringing prosperity to
millions, [democratic capitalism has undermined political tyranny and
promoted democracy and peace between nations of the world.]{.underline}
It is, without doubt, the world\'s most moral system. This last
statement may raise eyebrows in an era that has seen scandals from the
collapse of Enron to the devastation of personal and charitable wealth
caused by Bernard Madoff. That is not to minimize the crimes of
individuals like Madoff and others or the damage they cause. As we
explain, the off-the-charts criminality of individuals like Madoff no
more reflects the immorality of free enterprise than the murderous
crimes of a Ted Bundy or a Jeffrey Dahmer reflect a fundamental
breakdown of democratic society. [Democratic capitalism, *as a system,*
is more humane than government-dominated economies, including those in
countries that are otherwise democracies.]{.underline} [Nations that
liberalize their economies, that allow people greater economic
self-determination, end up moving, sooner or later, toward
democracy]{.underline}. Since the nations of the world began to
liberalize their economies in the mid-1980s, the percentage of
democratically elected governments has surged from 40 percent to more
than 60 percent today. China, for example, is not yet a Western-style
democracy. But the nation is freer today than it was during the era of
Mao Tse Tung and the repressive Cultural Revolution.

#### Capitalism is inevitable

**Vakulabharanam, 12** (Vamsi Vakulabharanam, faculty member with the
School of Economics at the University of Hyderabad, India." Why Does
Neoliberalism Persist Even After the Global Crisis?", Naked Capitalism,
http://triplecrisis.com/why-does-neoliberalism-persist-even-after-the-global-crisis/)//tj
gb

The 2007-9 crisis in [global capitalism brought a new energy and focus
to the heterodox economists, and more broadly to the critics of
neoliberalism from different arenas of society. It seemed clear at that
time that neoliberalism had run its course when it met its structural
contradiction]{.underline} -- with the burst of the US housing bubble
and the concomitant financial crises across the world, it looked like
the avenues through which demand was being generated were closed and the
system was poised for structural change. Three years later, Southern
Europe is witnessing an intense so-called sovereign debt crisis with the
working people bearing the brunt of it, and real economies in the
developed world are continuing to witness slow growth. The US seems to
be under the threat of the so-called fiscal cliff (which seems more like
a political event rather than an economic one). [The economies that grew
quickly during the neo-liberal period, like China and India, have slowed
down considerably. Across the globe, we seem to be going through a
period of uncertainty without a clear path ahead. Yet, neoliberalism
persists]{.underline}. Why? There are multiple explanations for this.
[Bailout packages of various governments were directed at rescuing
financial capital, and this has pitted the interests of financial
capital against the interests of the majority. The global left has not
been strong enough to take advantage of the crisis to better represent
the interests of the majority. Governments across the world, after a
brief gap, have returned to their neoliberal posture of supporting
financial capital and so forth]{.underline}. There is truth in all these
explanations. However, we need to broaden the array of explanations both
to take into account the spatial diversity of neoliberalism, as well as
to deepen our analytical understanding of this persistence. I offer one
such explanation from field explorations in India to add to the existing
explanations. This addition is not simply academic, but it shows the
need for deeper political engagement to bring about systemic change,
given that our explanations of the structural contradictions of
neoliberalism are on the mark. In two recent field visits that we (a
group of local researchers) undertook to understand the persistence of
neoliberalism at the concrete level, we found some interesting
phenomena. Both these visits were in the state of Andhra Pradesh in
South India. The first visit was in the region of Telangana, which is
highly politicized right now, as the people of the region are fighting
for a separate state within the Indian nation-state. The second visit
was to a tribal habitat in the northeastern region of the same state,
where communist struggles have been active for a while. [In both these
areas, there are continued appropriations of common lands, common
resources and minerals, such as Granite and Bauxite by local and foreign
capitalist elites aided by the State. In the process, these elites are
destroying the local livelihoods without creating credible alternative.
Both these are classic cases of primitive accumulation or accumulation
by dispossession, a process that has centrally defined neoliberalism
over the last thirty-five years across the globe.]{.underline}
[Accumulation by dispossession operates in our times through the
following modes of appropriation. First, it operates through the
acquisition of lands from small producers such as peasants, tribal
people, artisans and the urban poor in the name of Special Economic
Zones and the like]{.underline}. Some of the lands acquired thus, have
became open to speculative enterprises of real estate dealers. [Second,
there has been a large-scale privatization drive in most countries that
has made public sector enterprises alienate their properties at
throwaway prices to private players. Third, and these are the cases that
we have focused on -- commons have been appropriated with ease either
because the laws governing them are weak or because common properties
are often meddled with by the State.]{.underline} What we found in these
two regions is that the particular modes of appropriation that have come
into being with great force during the neoliberal period have persisted
even after the crisis. Why is this the case? [One explanation that ties
in with the explanations above is that resistance has not been strong
enough or effective from the people and their social movements or from
the larger left movements. The other explanation that we offered is that
neoliberalism has been able to create structures of populism that are
deeply entrenched]{.underline}. The local elites have pursued a
three-fold strategy for the continued appropriation of the commons.
First, they (with the support of the State) have put in place various
populist policy imperatives that have temporarily addressed the
consumption needs of the majority without altering the deeper neoliberal
structural forces that have inhibited employment growth and wage growth
over the last thirty years.

#### Capitalism helps the poor

**Foundation for Economic Education, 16** (Foundation for Economic

systems. "Capitalism is good for the poor", Foundation for Economic
Education, https://fee.org/articles/capitalism-is-good-for-the-poor)//tj
gb

[Nothing has done more to lift humanity out of poverty than the market
economy.]{.underline} This claim is true whether we are looking at a
time span of decades or of centuries. The number of people worldwide
living on less than about two dollars per day today is less than half of
what it was in 1990. [The biggest gains in the fight against poverty
have occurred in countries that have opened up their markets, such as
China and India. If we look over the longer historical period, we can
see that the trends today are just the continuation of capitalism's
victories in beating back poverty. For most of human history, we lived
in a world of a few haves and lots of have-nots.]{.underline} That
slowly began to change with the advent of capitalism and the Industrial
Revolution. As economic growth took off and spread throughout the
population, it created our own world in the West in which there are a
whole bunch of haves and a few have-more-and-betters. For example, [the
percentage of American households below the poverty line who have basic
appliances has grown steadily over the last few decades]{.underline},
with poor families in 2005 being more likely to own things like a
clothes dryer, dishwasher, refrigerator, or air conditioner than the
average household was in 1971. [And consumer items that didn't even
exist back then, such as cell phones, were owned by half of poor
households in 2005 and are owned by a substantial majority of them
today. Capitalism has also made poor people's lives far better by
reducing infant and child mortality rates, not to mention maternal death
rates during childbirth, and by extending life expectancies by
decades]{.underline}. Consider, too, the way capitalism's engine of
growth has enabled the planet to sustain almost 7 billion people,
compared to 1 billion in 1800. As Deirdre McCloskey has noted, if you
multiply the gains in consumption to the average human by the gain in
life expectancy worldwide by 7 (for 7 billion as compared to 1 billion
people), humanity as a whole is better off by a factor of around 120.
That's not 120 *percent* better off, but 120 *times* better off since
1800. The competitive market process has also made education, art, and
culture available to more and more people. [Even the poorest of
Americans, not to mention many of the global poor, have access through
the Internet and TV to concerts, books, and works of art that were
exclusively the province of the wealthy for centuries. And in the
wealthiest countries, the dynamics of capitalism have begun to change
the very nature of work]{.underline}. Where once humans toiled for 14
hours per day at backbreaking outdoor labor, now an increasing number of
us work inside in climate-controlled comfort. Our workday and workweek
have shrunk thanks to the much higher value of labor that comes from
working with productive capital. We spend a much smaller percentage of
our lives working for pay, whether we're rich or poor. [And even with
economic change, the incomes of the poor are much less variable, as they
are not linked to the unpredictable changes in weather that are part and
parcel of a predominer5antly agricultural economy long since
disappeared.]{.underline}

[Multiple scholars have observed a secular decline in interstate
violence in recent decades.]{.underline}105 [The Kantian triad of more
democracies, stronger multilateral institutions, and greater levels of
cross-border trade is well known. In recent years, international
relations theorists have stressed that commercial interdependence is a
bigger driver of this phenomenon than previously
thought.]{.underline}106 The liberal logic is straightforward. [The
benefits of cross-border exchange and economic interdependence act as a
powerful brake on the utility of violence in international
politics]{.underline}. The global supply chain and "just in time"
delivery systems have further imbricated national economies into the
international system. [This creates incentives for governments to
preserve an open economy even during times of crisis. The more that a
country's economy was enmeshed in the global supply chain, for example,
the less likely it was to raise tariffs after the 2008 financial
crisis.]{.underline}107 Similarly, global financiers are strongly
interested in minimizing political risk; historically, [the financial
sector has staunchly opposed initiating the use of force in world
politics.]{.underline}108 [Even militarily powerful actors must be wary
of alienating global capital. Globalization therefore creates powerful
pressures on governments not to close off their economies through
protectionism or military aggression.]{.underline} [Interdependence can
also tamp down conflicts that would otherwise be likely to break out
during a great power transition.]{.underline} Of the 15 times a rising
power has emerged to challenge a ruling power between 1500 and 2000, war
broke out 11 times.109 [Despite these odds, China's recent rise to great
power status has elevated tensions without leading to anything
approaching war. It could be argued that the Sino-American economic
relationship is so deep that it has tamped down the great power conflict
that would otherwise have been in full bloom over the past two decades.
Instead, both China and the United States have taken pains to talk about
the need for a new kind of great power relationship. Interdependence can
help to reduce the likelihood of an extreme event---such as a great
power war---from taking place.]{.underline} Will this be true for the
next generation economy as well? The two other legs of the Kantian
triad---democratization and multilateralism---are facing their own
problems in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.110 Economic openness
survived the negative shock of the 2008 financial crisis, [which
suggests that the logic of commercial liberalism will continue to hold
with equal force going forward]{.underline}. But some international
relations scholars doubt the power of globalization's pacifying effects,
arguing that interdependence is not a powerful constraint.111 Other
analysts go further, arguing that globalization exacerbates financial
volatility---which in turn can lead to political instability and
violence.112 [A different counterargument is that the continued growth
of interdependence will stall out. Since 2008, for example, the growth
in global trade flows has been muted, and global capital flows are still
considerably smaller than they were in the pre-crisis era. In trade,
this reflects a pre-crisis trend.]{.underline} Between 1950 and 2000,
trade grew, on average, more than twice as fast as global economic
output. In the 2000s, however, trade only grew about 30 percent more
than output.113 In 2012 and 2013, trade grew less than economic output.
The [McKinsey Global Institute estimates that global flows as a
percentage of output have fallen from 53 percent in 2007 to 39 percent
in 2014.]{.underline}114 [While the stock of interdependence remains
high, the flow has slowed to a trickle. The Financial Times has
suggested that the global economy has hit "peak trade."]{.underline}115
[If economic growth continues to outstrip trade, then the level of
interdependence will slowly decline, thereby weakening the liberal
constraint on great power conflicts.]{.underline} And there are [several
reasons to posit why interdependence might stall out. One possibility is
due to innovations reducing the need for traded goods.]{.underline} For
example, in the last decade, higher energy prices in the United States
triggered investments into conservation, alternative forms of energy,
and unconventional sources of hydrocarbons. All of these steps reduced
the U.S. demand for imported energy. A future in which compact fusion
engines are developed would further reduce the need for imported energy
even more.116 [A more radical possibility is the development of
technologies that reduce the need for physical trade across borders.
Digital manufacturing will cause the relocation of production facilities
closer to end-user markets,]{.underline} shortening the global supply
chain.117 An even more radical discontinuity would come from the
wholesale diffusion of 3-D printing. The ability of a single printer to
produce multiple component parts of a larger manufactured good
eliminates the need for a global supply chain. As Richard Baldwin notes,
"Supply chain unbundling is driven by a fundamental trade-off between
the gains from specialization and the costs of dispersal. This would be
seriously undermined by radical advances in the direction of mass
customization and 3D printing by sophisticated machines...To put it
sharply, transmission of data would substitute for transportation of
goods."118 [As 3-D printing technology improves, the need for large
economies to import anything other than raw materials concomitantly
declines.]{.underline}119 [Geopolitical ambitions could reduce economic
interdependence even further.]{.underline}120 Russia and [China have
territorial and quasi-territorial ambitions beyond their recognized
borders, and the United States has attempted to counter what it sees as
revisionist behavior]{.underline} by both countries. [In a low-growth
world, it is possible that leaders of either country would choose to
prioritize their nationalist ambitions over economic growth. More
generally, it could be that]{.underline} the expectation of future gains
fromh interdependence---rather than existing levels of
interdependence---constrains great power bellicosity.121 [If great
powers expect that the future benefits of international trade and
investment will wane, then commercial constraints on revisionist
behavior will lessen. All else equal, this increases the likelihood of
great power conflict going forward.]{.underline} There have been other
drivers of the decades-long reduction in militarized interstate
disputes. Nuclear deterrence has helped curb violent conflict among the
great powers. Multilateral peacekeeping missions mitigate small country
conflicts. Even if there is a decline in interdependence, it is possible
that the "Long Peace" will endure. Furthermore, it is impossible to
predict the degree to which either innovations or geopolitics will
lessen the need for international trade. Even technological optimists
acknowledge that the future diffusion of 3D printing is unclear.
Advocates of networked manufacturing insist that economic openness is a
prerequisite for the process to continue.122 And the degree of
geopolitical revisionism among great powers might be endogenous---that
is to say, preexisting levels of globalization might constrain
revisionist impulses, rather than such impulses weakening the globalized
economy. [If great powers resort to revisionist foreign policies,
however, then the global economy will start to resemble the Cold War era
of economic blocs and strategic embargoes---one in which trade and
investment follow the flag rather than follow the rate of return. The
increased American use of targeted financial sanctions, for example, has
already generated grumblings from peer competitors about finding ways to
diversify away from reliance upon the dollar]{.underline}.123 In 2015,
China introduced its own international payment and settlements system,
in part, to diversify away from reliance upon the dollar.124

#### Capitalism will always have relations to the modern world- it is inevitable

This essay also is a first attempt at understanding the difficult
relationship between two fundamental elements of our recent history,
capitalism and the territorial nation-state[. Capitalism is a
fundamental source of dynamic historical processes and relations in the
modem world,]{.underline} productive of surplus without which no modern
state can operate. The state thus cannot escape capitalism, as seen in
the rapid and massive fiscal punishment of would-be deviant states.
However, why capitalism uses state governance is not so obvious. The
territorial nation-state form and capitalism grew up together.
[Capitalism may not be inherently linked to the territorial nation-state
by systems logic, but rather, they coexist as a result of historical
contingency. We may consider the territorial form as an imperfect,
inherited tool for power elites who are relatively sensitive to the
systems impulses of capitalism]{.underline} ([we can envision that other
such tools and spaces may emerge in the future). The nation-state
remains a powerful tool for collective decision-making, commitment of
redistributed surplus to various projects]{.underline}, and legal
regulation, and borders are a powerful \"sub-tool\" for these
activities. Capitalism faces a difficult dilemma of making coherent
policies out of private, diverse interests, and these qualities of
states---territorial or not---are useful tools in such collective
projects. Borders in particular are useful if clumsy tools (e.g.,
entailing crossing delays) for monitoring and regulating movement when
governing a complex world system (e.g., to enforce intellectual property
rights by interdicting smuggled pirated goods). Yet, to operate with the
inherited tool of the territorial nation-state means taking on the full
political-social and cultural processes of nation-states, with their
instabilities, contradictions, and costs, as discussed above. [The
current capitalist managerial utopia is that the desired, simultaneous
presence and absence of borders acting upon mobility can be finessed by
strategies of differentiated rights and speed in their
crossing]{.underline} (Heyman 2009b). A parallel utopia is finely
differentiating migration regimes including apartheid managed temporary
labor (Heyman 2008). It is not clear that this managerial utopia is
realistic. [It is the relative balance of these uses and costs to
capital that will determine the future of bordered states]{.underline},
not as a system output but through a series of projects using and
tearing down the territorial state.

#### Capitalism has given women the ability to be free and have more opportunities

And yet, Nixon wasn't entirely wrong. [Capitalism did make life easier
for women.]{.underline} It made life easier for men, too, but as
historian Stephen Davies has pointed out, "women have particular cause
to be thankful above and beyond the gains in material well-being that
they share with men." This was true even before the advent of the
consumer technology Nixon was showing off in Moscow. [After the
Industrial Revolution]{.underline}, Davies writes, for the first time,
[women could earn an independent income and support themselves,
something that was practically]{.underline} (as well as legally[)
difficult in traditional society]{.underline}. This meant that not being
married, but rather being independent, was no longer an utter disaster
nor tantamount to a death sentence. For those who did marry, he
continues, [modern capitalism produced a suite of devices and
innovations that physically freed women from the demands and limitations
of domestic labo]{.underline}r. To take one example, [the modern washing
machine freed women from the need to spend one or often two entire days
of each week doing laundry. Other domestic appliances had similar
effects.]{.underline} ("The Force That Liberated Women," FEE.org) From
our perspective in the 21st century, we can question the assumption that
laundry should be women's work, but [capitalism didn't create the sexual
division of labor; it began the process of eliminating it.]{.underline}
It did so first by making labor less onerous, then by making
independence a more realistic option, and finally by creating a world in
which individuals can afford to reject the burdens of tradition --- and
to attempt to persuade others to join them in that rejection[. If
feminism is about women's liberation from millennia of oppression, then
capitalism is the sponsor, not the enemy, of feminism]{.underline}. This
is why, Davies claims, almost all of the earliest feminists "were ardent
laissez-faire liberals and supporters of capitalist industry. They were
well aware of the connection between the autonomy and freedom of choice
that they advocated for women and the economic transformations that had
made freedom possible as a lived reality." Making Change We might argue
that a combination of laws and culture limited women's options in the
1950s, that the prevalence of housewives did represent an injustice
because it resulted from women's lack of true freedom. As we've already
noted in the case of Nixon, [the people in charge of American government
were not champions of individual liberty]{.underline}. They had a
particular vision of how things should work, and they used the coercive
authority of the state to try to make it so. [But it was capitalism that
undermined their vision.]{.underline} Nixon welcomed the latest
appliances' making life easier for American women, but those dishwashers
and fancy refrigerators were having a less obvious longer-term effect:
by reducing the burden of domestic labor, they opened a world of options
that the men in power may not have been as happy about. Leisure isn't
just the absence of labor; it is the freedom to seek more rewarding
work. "It is undeniably true," McElroy writes, "that *The Feminine
Mystique* spoke to many women whose lives were changed as a result of
reading the book. For them, being a housewife was a negation of their
potential as human beings, and they discovered the courage to reach out
to make a different choice." But whether those women understood it or
not, it was the wealth of the market economy that enabled them to resist
tradition and explore other careers --- even when the larger culture may
not yet have condoned their doing so. [Capitalism, in other words, is
not the same thing as Western culture. To equate them is to miss the
ongoing struggle between the two. The market undermines traditions by
testing their value against more fluid social arrangements. Those
customs that depend on a particular historical condition will lose out,
because, as the economy grows, the rules change. Capitalism is not the
resistance to such changes. It is their catalyst.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism creates economic freedom- solves for war

**Gartzke, 5** (Erik Gartzke, Graduate from Columbia university and
political science professor at University of California- San Diego.
"Future Depends on Capitalizing on Capitalist Peace", CATO Institute,

gb

The present peace is unusual. Historically, powerful nations are the
most war prone. The conventional wisdom is that democracy fosters peace
but this claim fails scrutiny. It is based on statistical studies that
show democracies typically don't fight other democracies. Yet, the same
[studies show that democratic nations go to war about as much as other
nations overall. And more recent research makes clear that only the
affluent democracies are less likely to fight each other]{.underline}.
Poor democracies behave much like non-democracies when it comes to war
and lesser forms of conflict. [A more powerful explanation is emerging
from newer, and older, empirical research - the "capitalist
peace."]{.underline} As predicted by Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Norman
Angell and others, [nations with high levels of economic freedom not
only fight each other less, they go to war less often, period. Economic
freedom is a measure of the depth of free market institutions or, put
another way, of capitalism.]{.underline} The "democratic peace" is a
mirage created by the overlap between economic and political freedom.
[Democracy and economic freedom typically co-exist. Thus, if economic
freedom causes peace, then statistically democracy will also appear to
cause peace.]{.underline} When democracy and economic freedom are both
included in a statistical model, the results reveal that economic
freedom is considerably more potent in encouraging peace than democracy,
50 times more potent, in fact, according to my own research. Economic
freedom is highly statistically significant (at the one-per-cent level).
Democracy does not have a measurable impact, while nations with very low
levels of economic freedom are 14 times more prone to conflict than
those with very high levels. But, why would free markets cause peace?
[Capitalism is not only an immense generator of prosperity; it is also a
revolutionary source of economic, social and political change. Wealth no
longer arises primarily through land or control of natural
resources]{.underline}. **New Kind of Wealth** Prosperity in modern
societies is created by market competition and the efficient production
that arises from it. This new kind of wealth is hard for nations to
"steal" through conquest. In days of old, when the English did
occasionally storm Calais, nobles dreamed of wealth and power in
conquered lands, while visions of booty danced in the heads of peasant
soldiers. Victory in war meant new property. In a free market economy,
war destroys immense wealth for victor and loser alike. Even if capital
stock is restored, efficient production requires property rights and
free decisions by market participants that are difficult or impossible
to co-ordinate to the victor's advantage. The Iraqi war, despite Iraq's
immense oil wealth, will not be a money-maker for the United States.
Economic freedom is not a guarantee of peace. Other factors, like
ideology or the perceived need for self-defence, can still result in
violence. But, [where economic freedom has taken hold, it has made war
less likely. Research on the capitalist peace has profound implications
in today's world. Emerging democracies, which have not stabilized the
institutions of economic freedom, appear to be at least as warlike -
perhaps more so - than emerging dictatorships.]{.underline} Yet, the
United States and other western nations are putting immense resources
into democratization even in nations that lack functioning free markets.
This is in part based on the faulty premise of a "democratic peace." It
may also in part be due to public perception. Everyone approves of
democracy, but "capitalism" is often a dirty word. However, in recent
decades, an increasing number of people have rediscovered the economic
virtues of the "invisible hand" of free markets. We now have an
additional benefit of economic freedom - international peace. The actual
presence of peace in much of the world sets this era apart from others.
The empirical basis for optimistic claims - about either democracy or
capitalism - can be tested and refined. [The way forward is to
capitalize on the capitalist peace, to deepen its roots and extend it to
more countries through expanding markets, development, and a common
sense of international purpose]{.underline}. The risk today is that
faulty analysis and anti-market activists may distract the developed
nations from this historic opportunity.

#### Capitalism is key to maintain individualism- fosters entrepreneurship

Special Economic Zone Authority in Aqaba, Jordan. "The Identity Of
Entrepreneurs As An Engine Of Growth", Entrepreneur,
https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/270868)//tj gb

When it comes [to studying the [identity of an
entrepreneur,](http://entm.ag/1IngIA3) the concept of individualism is
central]{.underline}. Many critics claim that entrepreneurs focus on
nothing but their self-interest (i.e. profit maximization). Essentially,
[the term "individualism" refers to the sphere of non-coerced actions as
opposed to the institutions of government, which ultimately rest on
force]{.underline}. Entrepreneurs do have an identity. Such a type of
identity is complex, which resembles "a great number of infinitely
intersecting circles, resting on the possibility of belonging with one
part, one aspect of one's individuality, perhaps with only one closely
defined part of one's range of ability, to one organization, and with
others to others," as Otto von Gierke (1841-1921) once wrote. It has
been produced by a process of development in which society became more
"polished." A development that was accompanied by greater complexity and
variation in the [connections and associations](http://entm.ag/1Thip7N)
entrepreneurs develop. The French political thinker, Alexis de
Tocqueville, looked at the growing sophistication of individualism as
"intermediate institutions," one of the essential features of civil
society and modernity. Thus, entrepreneurs -through their behavior of
maximizing utility- do not ultimately [live in
isolation.](http://entm.ag/1Bx4sv4) They have a history of increasing
density and a variety of voluntary connections. Other critics of
entrepreneurial individualism are the nationalists of any jurisdiction
who import the orthodox doctrine of "political sovereignty," arguing
that one of the distinctive [features of
entrepreneurs](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/245448) render
regimes dependent on foreign ambitions and local institutions fragile to
"corporate power." [However, autonomous individuals (entrepreneurs) who
pursue their own ends do so not as isolated atomistic individuals, but
as social beings that can flourish and realize their full potential only
through a net of [relations with other people.](http://entm.ag/1hOn7eq)
What is important, from a policy perspective, is that the mutually
beneficial relationships between entrepreneurs and their local
communities are voluntary and consensual, rather than coerced or a
product of power or status-based relations]{.underline}. To sum it up,
the [entrepreneurial identity is vital for [human
flourishing](http://entm.ag/1FbM2yJ) (which economists label as "social
capital") and a by-product of the free action of individuals pursuing
their goals]{.underline}, while living peacefully with everyone else. As
such, [entrepreneurs are a direct representation of the spontaneous
order of [social cooperation.](http://entm.ag/1Lv1CXK)]{.underline} Such
voluntary cooperation is also the means by which shared or collective
goals are realized without resorting to state compulsion or formal
coercion.

[Capitalism provides a spectrum of varying degrees of market
control,]{.underline} whereas communist nations must maintain all
commercial activities under control of the state --- and thus only the
state is to blame in case of failures. It is easy to tell when a
communist nation is no longer purely communist: it develops a
widely-accepted free market, such as "communism with Chinese
characteristics." On the other hand, must a capitalist nation completely
abolish its free market in order to become non-capitalist? Soviet Russia
had a thriving black market. Even the smallest, most highly-regulated
market could allow for aspects of capitalist society to develop --- [as
long as the market maintains some degree of autonomy. In the absence of
exogenous forces, the liberal believes that the resilience of capitalism
lies in its ability to perpetually maintain its equilibrium --- in any
time or place, regardless of social circumstances]{.underline}. Liberals
insist that free markets emerge from human society --- somewhat
analogous to the emergence of language --- with an ability to
automatically equilibrate through Adam Smith's conception of the
"invisible hand." [Since liberals believe all humans to be rational and
profit-seeking, the combination of many individuals in selfish pursuit
of their own desires --- combined with a state that can enforce property
rights --- will automatically create a free market that can peacefully
coordinate prices based upon supply and demand.]{.underline} Hayek
(1948) is so enamored with this emergent system that he claims that if
the price mechanism "were the result of deliberate human design...this
mechanism would have been acclaimed as one of the greatest triumphs of
the human mind." The liberal insists that capitalism self-regulates when
left to its own devices; Friedman spends many pages celebrating the free
market's efficacy in balancing itself, and the hazards (both societal
and economic) of government intervention. Mutability of Capitalist
Structures Against the advice of the liberal, most capitalist societies
have indulged in substantial interventionism. The liberal would claim
that this intervention only becomes necessary when societies are afraid
to allow their free markets the freedom they require to self-stabilize
--- yet Keynes, Marx, and the sociological paradigm provide compelling
counter-arguments. Keynes states that capitalism is inherently unstable
due to people's irrational "animal spirits," while the sociologists note
how shifts in how people create and define meaning may lead to a
breakdown of capitalist society. Even stalwart supporters of the free
market, such as Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, believe that the government
must sometimes intervene in the economy to prevent disaster. As shown by
the 2008 collapse, advanced capitalist societies are still prone to
irrational panics and resulting crises --- even though every individual
actor, as Bernanke claims, may have acted rationally. In such a case,
the only solution is for the government to inject money into the system
to stall collapse. A staunch liberal might argue that the 2008 collapse
only came about through government interference in the first place ---
but the combination of mismanagement and irresponsible sub-prime loans
leading up to the crash does not seem to support this argument.
[Following the wide range of socioeconomic models that can still be
defined as "capitalism," one of the reasons why capitalism has proved so
resilient is its ability to take different forms to adapt to different
contexts. Scandinavia, for example, has high public spending and many
socialized services, and yet maintains a free market economy across
other sectors. Although a staunch liberal such as Friedman would protest
that the Scandinavian system does not allow for enough market freedoms,
most economists would acknowledge that Scandinavia has remained
fundamentally capitalist in spite of expansive government
interference;]{.underline} Polanyi would even argue that Scandinavia's
relative stability and happiness is a direct result of government
restrictions on the free market. [The wide variety of potential
capitalist structures also allows governments considerable flexibility
in mitigating financial crises --- thus increasing both the resilience
and popularity of capitalism.]{.underline}

Beginning the historical investigation at the end of the 19th and early
20th centuries in the United States, [neoliberalism appears as the third
such »social order«. A first »financial hegemony« prevailed from the
beginning of the century,]{.underline} but it was destabilized during
the Great Depression and the New Deal, a period of intense class
struggle. The social order characteristic of the period that stretches
from the New Deal to the late 1980s can be denoted as »social
democratic« or »Keynesian«, with significant differences among
countries. Its main social feature was a »compromise« between managerial
and popular classes, paralleling the containment of capitalist
interests. How neoliberalism was established historically lies beyond
the limits of the present study. [Conversely, the description of the
methods used is rather straightforward. A new discipline was imposed on
workers, with the control of their purchasing power, new labor
conditions, and the decline of welfare. While, after World War II, a
large percentage of profits were conserved within nonfinancial
corporations to the end of investment, in neoliberalism, profits were
lavishly distributed as dividends and, up to 2000s, a large fraction was
paid out as interest.]{.underline} Policies aiming at price stability
were substituted for macro policies tending to growth and employment.
Financial regulations inherited from the Great Depression were gradually
lifted. Restrictions to international trade were eliminated to the
benefit of free trade, and the free international mobility of capital
was imposed to most countries. Neoliberal »globalization« allowed for
the deployment of transnational corporations worldwide. [The United
States emerged from the two world wars as the leading international
power. While other imperialist countries, as France or the United
Kingdom, were still involved in the defense of their traditional empire,
the United States abandoned the first attempts at the constitutions of
such an empire at the end of the 19th century, to the benefit of the
Wilsonian vision of the informal dominance of the most advanced among
capitalist countries, with the gradual imposition of the dollar as
international currency.]{.underline} The Great Depression did not
destabilize this hegemony, which was dramatically consolidated by the
victorious participation of the country in World War II. The United
States never accepted the new rules of the Bretton Woods agreements
limiting international trade and the international movements of capital,
and the dollar was confirmed as a substitute for a truly international
currency. After World War II, the United States fought for the defense,
in front of the Soviet Union, of the so-called »free world« and for
their own dominance worldwide. Everywhere, corruption, subversion, and
wars were used to these ends. [The U.S. economy came to dominate the
nonfinancial and financial world economy. The transnational corporations
of the country were the most powerful, in particular financial
institutions. In the 1970s, many analysts of global trends pointed,
however, to a decline of U.S. hegemony and the formation of a »triad«
(the United States, Europe, and Japan). Neoliberalism inverted these
trends and strengthened the preeminence of the U.S.
economy]{.underline}. As of the 2000s, the U.S. economy was presented to
other major capitalist countries as a model to be emulated, and the
United States as a leader to be followed.

[Capitalism Promotes Equality Income inequality is the cry of the
statist. Equality of opportunity is the anthem of
capitalism]{.underline}. People will never be wholly equal. Because of
my four inch vertical leap, I will never be able to dunk a basketball.
In a basketball game against Michael Jordan, I will lose ten times out
of ten. Even if I practice hard and improve my game significantly, I
will probably never be able to overcome Jordan's inherent athletic
gifts. [The capitalist would point out that my attempt to compete
resulted in improvements in my basketball skills and ability. Jordan may
still pound me into dust, but the overall game between us improved. I am
better off as a result of my effort. The statist takes a different
view.]{.underline} Jordan's basketball superiority is unfair. Therefore,
he must be handicapped in some way. He must be forced to give me credit
for some of the baskets he scores. This does nothing to improve the game
or improve my performance. In fact, I have less reason to improve my
game. I might have to work for my points instead of taking Jordan's. The
cry about income inequality is one of the biggest loads of crap being
foisted on the public today. [The statist sees a static world where a
low income earner today is a low income earner tomorrow, when the truth
is just the opposite. People can change their income through their own
efforts.]{.underline} I may never earn as much as Bill Gates, but I can
earn more than I do today. When I strive to earn more, I help expand the
economy. Taking money from Gates and giving it to me may benefit me
personally, but it will do nothing to help the economy. Winston
Churchill said, "[The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing
of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of
miseries." By focusing on opportunity and not outcome, capitalism is the
more moral economic system]{.underline}.

[decisions](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2012/10/13/the-new-model)
of socialist countries like Sweden to reduce taxes and welfare are
widely seen as acknowledgments of the failure of overly egalitarian
systems to produce adequate economic growth]{.underline}. But evidence
suggests that there is also a point at which high levels of inequality
begin to deliver less economic growth, not more --- and that [the United
States has passed that point, according to
[research](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1402.pdf) by
the International Monetary Fund. That's partly because more-unequal
economies tend to have oversize and overcompensated financial sectors
that are more prone to booms and busts. Other researchers have
[found](http://users.nber.org/~agelber/papers/prizestructure.pdf) that
worker productivity suffers when economic gains are not widely
shared]{.underline}. A further reason may be that rising income
inequality erodes the
[trust](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp16176.pdf) people
have in one another and their willingness to [cooperate. As the
political economist Francis Fukuyama has
[written](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/1999/reforms/fukuyama.htm),
this "social capital" lubricates the increasingly complex machinery of
market economies and the increasingly contentious machinery of
democracy. Countries with more social capital tend to be healthier,
happier and richer]{.underline}.

## Neolib is implemented in everything

#### The Plan does NOT cause Left- or Right-wing Populism and thus doesn't end neoliberalism

#### Everyone is a Neoliberalist. That's how pervasive it is. It can't be solved for.

**Monbiot 16'** (George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist and the author
of Feral, The Age of Consent and Out of the Wreckage: a New Politics for
an Age of Crisis <https://www.theguardian.com/bo>
oks/2016/apr/15/neoliberalism-ideology-problem-george-monbiot)

[So pervasive has neoliberalism become that we seldom even recognise it
as an ideology. We appear to accept the proposition that this utopian,
millenarian faith describes a neutral force; a kind of biological law,
like Darwin's theory of evolution]{.underline}. But the philosophy arose
as a conscious attempt to reshape human life and shift the locus of
power. [Neoliberalism sees competition as the defining characteristic of
human relations. It redefines citizens as consumers, whose democratic
choices are best exercised by buying and selling, a process that rewards
merit and punishes inefficiency. It maintains that "the market" delivers
benefits that could never be achieved by planning.]{.underline} Attempts
to limit competition are treated as inimical to liberty. Tax and
regulation should be minimised, public services should be privatised.
The organisation of labour and collective bargaining by trade unions are
portrayed as market distortions that impede the formation of a natural
hierarchy of winners and losers. Inequality is recast as virtuous: a
reward for utility and a generator of wealth, which trickles down to
enrich everyone. Efforts to create a more equal society are both
counterproductive and morally corrosive. The market ensures that
everyone gets what they deserve. [We internalise and reproduce its
creeds. The rich persuade themselves that they acquired their wealth
through merit, ignoring the advantages -- such as education, inheritance
and class -- that may have helped to secure it. The poor begin to blame
themselves for their failures, even when they can do little to change
their circumstances. Never mind structural unemployment: if you don't
have a job it's because you are unenterprising. Never mind the
impossible costs of housing: if your credit card is maxed out, you're
feckless and improvident. Never mind that your children no longer have a
school playing field: if they get fat, it's your fault. In a world
governed by competition, those who fall behind become defined and
self-defined as losers. Among the results, as Paul Verhaeghe documents
in his book What About Me? are epidemics of self-harm, eating disorders,
depression, loneliness, performance anxiety and social phobia. Perhaps
it's unsurprising that Britain, in which neoliberal ideology has been
most rigorously applied, is the loneliness capital of Europe. We are all
neoliberals now.]{.underline}

#### Alt cause to Neolib not just Arms Sales

**Kuttner 19'** (Robert Kuttner is co-founder and co-editor of The
American Prospect, and professor at Brandeis University\'s Heller
School. His latest book is Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism? In
addition to writing for the Prospect, he writes for HuffPost, The Boston
Globe, and The New York Review of
Books.https://prospect.org/article/neoliberalism-political-success-economic-failure)

Now, after nearly half a century, the verdict is in. Virtually every one
of these policies has failed, even on their own terms. Enterprise has
been richly rewarded, taxes have been cut, and regulation reduced or
privatized. The economy is vastly more unequal, yet economic growth is
slower and more chaotic than during the era of managed capitalism.
[Deregulation has produced not salutary competition, but market
concentration. Economic power has resulted in feedback loops of
political power, in which elites make rules that bolster further
concentration. The culprit isn't just "markets"---some impersonal force
that somehow got loose again. This is a story of power using theory. The
mixed economy was undone by economic elites, who revised rules for their
own benefit. They invested heavily in friendly theorists to bless this
shift as sound and necessary economics, and friendly politicians to put
those theories into practice.]{.underline} Recent years have seen two
spectacular cases of market mispricing with devastating consequences:
the near-depression of 2008 and irreversible climate change. The
economic collapse of 2008 was the result of the deregulation of finance.
It cost the real U.S. economy upwards of \$15 trillion (and vastly more
globally), depending on how you count, far more than any conceivable
efficiency gain that might be credited to financial innovation.
Free-market theory presumes that innovation is necessarily benign. But
much of the financial engineering of the deregulatory era was
self-serving, opaque, and corrupt---the opposite of an efficient and
transparent market. The existential threat of global climate change
reflects the incompetence of markets to accurately price carbon and the
escalating costs of pollution. The British economist Nicholas Stern has
aptly termed the worsening climate catastrophe history's greatest case
of market failure. Here again, this is not just the result of failed
theory. The entrenched political power of extractive industries and
their political allies influences the rules and the market price of
carbon. This is less an invisible hand than a thumb on the scale. The
premise of efficient markets provides useful cover. The grand neoliberal
experiment of the past 40 years has demonstrated that markets in fact do
not regulate themselves. Managed markets turn out to be more equitable
and more efficient. Yet the theory and practical influence of
neoliberalism marches splendidly on, because it is so useful to
society's most powerful people---as a scholarly veneer to what would
otherwise be a raw power grab. The British political economist Colin
Crouch captured this anomaly in a book nicely titled The Strange
Non-Death of Neoliberalism. Why did neoliberalism not die? As Crouch
observed, neoliberalism failed both as theory and as policy, but
succeeded superbly as power politics for economic elites. The neoliberal
ascendance has had another calamitous cost---to democratic legitimacy.
As government ceased to buffer market forces, daily life has become more
of a struggle for ordinary people. The elements of a decent middle-class
life are elusive---reliable jobs and careers, adequate pensions, secure
medical care, affordable housing, and college that doesn't require a
lifetime of debt. Meanwhile, life has become ever sweeter for economic
elites, whose income and wealth have pulled away and whose loyalty to
place, neighbor, and nation has become more contingent and less
reliable. [Large numbers of people, in turn, have given up on the
promise of affirmative government, and on democracy itself. After the
Berlin Wall came down in 1989, ours was widely billed as an era when
triumphant liberal capitalism would march hand in hand with liberal
democracy. But in a few brief decades, the ostensibly secure regime of
liberal democracy has collapsed in nation after nation, with echoes of
the 1930s.]{.underline} As the great political historian Karl Polanyi
warned, when markets overwhelm society, ordinary people often turn to
tyrants. In regimes that border on neofascist, klepto-capitalists get
along just fine with dictators, undermining the neoliberal premise of
capitalism and democracy as complements. Several authoritarian thugs,
playing on tribal nationalism as the antidote to capitalist
cosmopolitanism, are surprisingly popular. It's also important to
appreciate that neoliberalism is not laissez-faire. Classically, the
premise of a "free market" is that government simply gets out of the
way[. This is nonsensical, since all markets are creatures of rules,
most fundamentally rules defining property, but also rules defining
credit, debt, and bankruptcy; rules defining patents, trademarks, and
copyrights; rules defining terms of labor; and so on. Even deregulation
requires rules. In Polanyi's words, "laissez-faire was
planned]{.underline}.

accepted the attack on Iraq if it had not been for the mushroom cloud
rising behind Ms Condoleezza Rice on TV when she declared "I do not want

threatening posture -- because "our country is running out of enemies"
-- but the governments of South Korea and China would have blocked any
military attack by the US. The leaders in Pyongyang also need the US as
enemy in order to justify the heavy oppression of its citizens, and

[The United States is now closer than it has ever been to a nuclear war
with North Korea]{.underline}, a former top US military officer warned
Sunday, saying he saw little prospect of a diplomatic solution. Mullen,
a former chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, attributed the rising
danger to Donald Trump's "incredibly disruptive" presidency. "And in my
view, an incredibly dangerous climate exists out there in that
uncertainty with how this all ends up," he said on ABC's "This Week."
"One in particular that is top of the list is North Korea." "[We're
actually closer, in my view, to a nuclear war with North Korea and in
that region than we have ever been]{.underline}," he said, adding, "I
don't see the opportunities to solve this diplomatically at this
particular point."Mullen, who served as the top US military adviser to
both presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, questioned whether
Trump can be constrained by US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, National
Security Adviser H.R. McMaster or White House chief of staff John Kelly.
"Will he follow through on his rhetoric? Or will we actually be able to
get to a situation where it could be solved peacefully?" Mullen asked.
"I'm just more inclined to see over time that the rhetoric seems to be
where the president is, and that will limit the constraining ability
that both Jim Mattis and H.R. McMaster and John Kelly have," he said.
Trump warned in a speech to the UN General Assembly in September that
the United States "will have no choice but to totally destroy North
Korea" if forced to defend itself or its allies. In August, [he vowed to
unleash "fire and fury" on North Korea if it continued to threaten the
United States or its allies.]{.underline} [**Pyongyang conducted its
sixth nuclear test**]{.underline} September 3 and, **[despite escalating
sanctions]{.underline}**, on November 28 it test-launched an
intercontinental missile capable of striking the United States.
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who warned Sunday of a sharp increase
in the risk of pre-emptive attack if North Korea conducts any more
tests, said Trump had decided early on to deny North Korea the
capability to strike the United States with a nuclear-tipped
missile."2018 will be a year of opportunity and extreme danger," Graham
said on CBS's "Face the Nation."

The United States [for the first time in years is sending its diplomat
responsible for foreign military sales to the Singapore Airshow to
promote U.S.-made weapons]{.underline}, a U.S. official said on
Thursday, as the State Department prepares for an overseas arms sales
push. The [attendance of Ambassador Tina Kaidanow at]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} Feb. 6-10 air [show]{.underline}, the [most important
in the Asia Pacific region, is aimed at boosting sales for U.S. arms
manufacturers such as F-35 jets]{.underline} made by Lockheed Martin
Corp and missile manufactured by Raytheon Co. President Donald [Trump's
administration is nearing completion of a new "Buy American"
initiative]{.underline} that calls for U.S. military attaches and
diplomats to play a much bigger role in the sale of billions of dollars
more in business overseas. ["We will be working at strengthening our
advocacy at every level of the embassy, from your commercial officer, up
through your ambassador,"]{.underline} the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity told reporters on Thursday[. Singapore could be
seen as the test case for the Trump administration's new strategy of
having the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department take a more active
role in securing foreign arms deals]{.underline}, which require State
Department approval. For the first time since at least 2009, the U.S.
delegation at the air show will include the top State Department
official overseeing arms sales. Kaidanow holds that role with the title
principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs. [The U.S. exported \$49.5 billion of aerospace and defense
products to Asia-Pacific in 2016,]{.underline} compared to European
demand of \$49.8 billion, according to U.S. Department of Commerce data.
The [official said]{.underline} of [the "Buy America" initiative, "I
would expect with all of the energy the U.S. government is putting
behind this, as well as all of the energy the companies are putting
behind this, that I would hope to see very good numbers" for foreign
military sales.]{.underline} The State Department said in a statement
that Kaidanow "will hold consultations on defense trade issues and
promote more than 150 U.S. companies and trade organizations exhibiting
the latest aerospace technologies[." Demand for U.S.-made arms is high
and foreign military sales in fiscal 2017]{.underline}, comprising the
final months of Obama's term and much of Trump's first year in office,
climbed to \$42 billion, compared to \$31 billion in the prior year,
according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Remy Nathan,

Indicative of the cooling of Singapore-China relations over the past few
years has been the rising criticism of Singapore in China's
state-controlled press. An increasingly common refrain in Chinese media
outlets is the critique that [Singapore has been siding with the United
States against the People's Republic of China]{.underline} (PRC[) over
the South China Sea disputes]{.underline}. Topping this wave was a
debate between Singapore's ambassador to China, Stanley Loh, and the
editor-in-chief of China's Global Times, Hu Xijin, which played out over
several issues of that newspaper. The exchange [saw China's Ministry of
Foreign A!airs weigh in on the side of Hu. In contention was the
assertion by the Global Times that Singapore's mention of the rule of
law in the South China Sea during the 2016 Non-Aligned Movement summit
in Venezuela was intended to signal a siding with Washington against
Beijing.]{.underline} Singapore disputes this claim. Online chatter and,
occasionally, personal interactions in China have also been taking on a
more overtly critical tone toward Singapore[. Chinese
commentary]{.underline} on Internet forums and in op-eds periodically
accuses [Singapore of "forgetting its origins"]{.underline} (wangben)
[or]{.underline} of [being "a country of Han traitors"]{.underline}
(hanjianguo hanjianguo), presumably because Singapore's ethnic majority
is Han Chinese. The term hanjian is especially emotionally charged for
the PRC, having originated as an epithet for Chinese collaborators with
Japan during the "war of resistance" (1937--45). Commentary too depicts
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as useless and ine!ective---a view that
Singaporean business people also report hearing from Chinese associates.
So pervasive is online vitriol toward Singapore that several Chinese
Internet memes list "hating Singapore" as a daily task for a patriotic
PRC citizen. The current round of Singapore-China disagreements began in
2010, when [Singapore's then foreign minister George Yeo was
characterized by Beijing as leading criticism in ASEAN of China's
increasing willingness to assert its claims over disputed South China
Sea]{.underline} waters. [This earned Singapore the reminder from then
foreign minister Yang Jiechi that it is a "small country" that should
remember its place]{.underline}. Yang directed his remarks toward all
ASEAN members present, but was reportedly staring at Yeo while
delivering those statements. Periodic Chinese criticism of Singapore's
close relationship with the United States followed, with warnings that
small and medium-sized countries should not play major powers against
each other or allow U.S. manipulation. Singapore's insistence on the
rule of law in the South China Sea over PRC objections likewise upset
Beijing. Its military training in Taiwan also drew China's ire,
culminating in the seizure in Hong Kong of Singaporean armored vehicles
returning from exercises.

raising the possibility of a peace treaty replacing the armistice that

[The reciprocal commitments in the Singapore joint statement, the DPRK
commitment to "complete denuclearization of the Korean
peninsula"]{.underline} and the [US commitment to reconcile and "build a
lasting and stable peace regime" in Korea, could have potentially
profound implications for the balance of power in Northeast
Asia.]{.underline} Skeptics wonder if either side means what it says.
Nobody knows. The only way to find out is sustained negotiations,
keeping one's commitments, and testing whether the other side does.
Dismantling production facilities, disarming, and verifying it will take
several years. So will [convincing steps towards reconciliation. The
first order of business is to induce North Korea to suspend production
of fissile material and possibly suspend production and deployment of
intermediate- and intercontinental-range missiles. Remote monitoring may
prove of some use]{.underline} but delaying suspension to negotiate
detailed verification would allow time for more plutonium and highly
enriched uranium to be produced and more missiles to be fielded in the
interim. In return, [Washington could issue a declaration with Seoul and
Pyongyang committing to end the Korean War; sanctions under the Trading
with the Enemy Act]{.underline}, imposed before the nuclear issue arose,
could be relaxed for yet a third time; and energy assistance that was
unilaterally halted by South Korea in 2008 could also be resumed.
Verification would begin with declarations by Pyongyang of all its
fissile material, nuclear weapons and intermediate- and long-range
missiles, along with all its production sites. It could then be pursued
along the lines of a joint document from October 2008, in which [North
Korea agreed to allow "full access" to "experts of the six parties" with
the IAEA "to provide consultancy and assistance" for "safeguards
appropriate to non-nuclear-weapons states".]{.underline} It included
records, "personal notebooks" and "interviews with technical personnel",
"forensic measurements of nuclear materials and equipment" and
"environmental samples and samples of nuclear waste" at the three
declared sites at Yongbyon -- the reactor, the reprocessing plant and
the fuel fabrication plant. This might suffice to ascertain how much
plutonium North Korea had produced, and, if not, Pyongyang also agreed
to allow "access, based on mutual consent, to undeclared sites". 9 [This
will require further steps to end enmity, including the start of a peace
process in Korea, steps towards diplomatic recognition, energy aid and
reciprocal inspections in South Korea]{.underline}

[Singapore and the United States, though not formal
allies]{.underline},1 [have enjoyed a broad and deep partnership that
has spanned decades]{.underline}. [The relationship]{.underline}, based
on a shared belief that a strong U.S. presence in the region is vital
for peace, stability and prosperity[, extends across the security,
economic and people-to-people realms and has made important
contributions to regional stability]{.underline}. This has benefitted
the United States, Singapore and other countries in the region,
including China. President Barack Obama's decision to host a state
dinner for Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in August this year
to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two
countries highlights the administration's recognition of the importance
of this relationship. [Yet, precisely because Singapore is a good and
reliable partner, it is easy to take it for granted]{.underline}. The
next administration must understand and appreciate the
contributions---and constraints---of the partnership if it is to
flourish moving forwards. [Singapore is one of the United States' most
committed partners in the region. This commitment stems from a
deep-rooted sense of insecurity about its external environment and a
firm belief that the United States' presence helps to preserve
Singapore's autonomy and options, as well as maintain the peace and
stability that has undergirded the region's]{.underline} economic
growth. Singapore's sense of insecurity has, in a sense, been present
from its creation. It is a small, multi-ethnic city-state that would
disappear into many lakes in the United States.2 Singapore's history---a
sudden separation from Malaysia of which it was a part till 1965, and
race riots in the 1960s, as well as geography---it is positioned amidst
larger majority Muslim neighbors, have left it with an acute sense of
vulnerability. Two factors continue to feed that sense of vulnerability
today. [The first concerns developments within its Muslim-majority
neighbors, Malaysia and Indonesia, and is less publicly spoken about
given its sensitivity. The second factor relates to the larger regional
situation.]{.underline} Singapore is situated just south of [Malaysia
and a causeway measuring under a mile connects the two
countries.]{.underline} It takes less than an hour to drive from many
parts of Singapore to Malaysia and many Malaysians (and Singaporeans)
make that commute each day to go to school or work. While [Singapore's
relations with Malaysia are generally cordial, the ethnic and political
situation in the country is watched carefully]{.underline}. The
population mix in Singapore and Malaysia is similar, though ethnic
proportions are roughly the mirror image of each other.3 In 1969, ethnic
[violence in Malaysia spilled over into Singapore and the fear is that
this might happen]{.underline} again. Current assessments appear rather
grim: a senior Singapore official warns of the political and social
space for non-Muslims in Malaysia "narrowing significantly and
continuing to shrink", of race relations in Malaysia being "fraught",
and of [the "unpredictability" of an increasingly Islamic
government]{.underline}.4 [Singapore also keeps a close eye on
Indonesia]{.underline}, Southeast Asia's largest country and the world's
largest Muslim population. Between 1963 and 1966, [Indonesian
nationalism manifested itself in konfrontasi]{.underline}
(confrontation) to ganjang (crush) Malaysia (of which Singapore till
1965 was still a part). There were over 40 bomb attacks in about two
years in Singapore alone.5 Nationalism in Indonesia today takes less
violent forms, but Singapore remains concerned to preserve its autonomy

[The United States shares with Singapore its assessment that a weakened
U.S. presence would destabilize the region]{.underline}, and that
China's rise is both an opportunity as well as challenge. It is also
alert to the threat of terrorism in Southeast Asia. As [a resident
Pacific power and a trading nation, the United States depends on a
stable, prosperous Asia. East Asia alone accounts for about one-third of
the world's people and one-quarter of global economic
output]{.underline}. As Assistant Secretary of Bureau of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs Daniel Russel reminds us, "\[t\]he Asia-Pacific region
matters for U.S. jobs and U.S. security".20 [Singapore's founding father
Lee Kuan Yew put what is at stake in even starker terms: The 21st
century will be a contest for supremacy in the Pacific, because that is
where the growth will be.]{.underline} That is where the bulk of the
economic strength of the globe will come from. If the U.S. does not hold
its ground in the Pacific, it cannot be a world leader. America's core
interest requires that it remains the superior power on the Pacific. [To
give up this position would diminish America's role throughout the
world. The United States' alliances and partnerships play an
instrumental role in maintaining its influence in the
region]{.underline}. While alliances carry with them a risk of
entanglement, this burden is greatly lessened with partnerships[.
Singapore works quietly and effectively to facilitate U.S. presence
through access agreements as well as supporting U.S. embedment in the
region's economic and security architecture in formal and informal
ways.]{.underline} As a keen and balanced observer of regional
developments, Singapore also provides "advice and good counsel" to the

[Owing to their peripheral location and relative lack of strategic
importance]{.underline} to the United States[, most Southeast Asian
states were even more concerned about a potential American withdrawal
after the Cold War in the face of a rising China]{.underline}. Much has
been written about Southeast Asian policies of engagement with China to
mediate the China threat (Ba, 2003; Shambaugh, 2004/5; Goh, 2007). [At
the same time, however, they have tried selectively to harness the
superior US force in the region to deter the potential aggression from
China]{.underline}. Two Southeast Asian states -- the Philippines and
Thailand -- are formal allies of the United States, but neither plays
host to American bases. Instead, they and a number of non-allied
countries, [including Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia -- provide
military facilities and access to the US naval and air
forces]{.underline}. They also participate in bilateral and multilateral
joint exercises with the US forces, and some countries have preferential
military supply relations with the Americans (Goh, 2007/08, pp.
113--157). They further demonstrate hierarchical deference and support
by additionally tying themselves more closely [to the United States in
the short- to medium-term fight against terrorism, to help anchor the
United States in the region as a counterweight against
China]{.underline} (Goh, 2005b; Khong, 2004). Rather than encouraging
the United States to target its forces directly against China, though,
[the goal is to further buttress American military superiority in the
region, or to demonstrate the ability to harness it in ways required to
act as a general deterrence to Chinese]{.underline} (or other)
aggression.12 At the same time, they also seek to strengthen their
individual military capabilities [by attracting the US military aid and
training, trade, and economic assistance]{.underline}

Depending on one's perspective[, Southeast Asia in the early 21st
century is either a glass half full or a glass half empty. The glass is
half full in the sense that for the majority of countries in Southeast
Asia, these are relatively stable, peaceful, and prosperous
times.]{.underline} The economies of the region have either recovered
fully, or are well on their way to full recovery, from the disastrous
1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis. Singapore and Malaysia have registered
strong economic growth, while Vietnam has become the darling of foreign
investors, and in 2006 its gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate was
second only to the PRC in Asia. Indonesia and the Philippines are
experiencing good levels of growth (5-6 percent), while even Laos and
Cambodia are achieving respectable levels of GDP growth. [At the
political level, the region has witnessed smooth leadership transitions
in several countries (Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam) and,
most importantly, democracy is being consolidated in Indonesia,
Southeast Asia's largest, and arguably most important,
country.]{.underline} Indonesia is also witnessing perhaps the world's
most successful peace process in Aceh. At the security level, although
territorial disputes continue to simmer, there is no danger that any of
these will result in outright conflict. [Indeed the chance of interstate
conflict between the ASEAN states is almost (but not entirely)
unthinkable.]{.underline}

[Transnational terrorist networks such as Jemaah Islamiyah have been
disrupted (but not destroyed); piracy attacks are down thanks partly to
the cooperative efforts of Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia; and in
the Philippines]{.underline}, there are cautious grounds for optimism
that a peace deal for Mindanao can be concluded in 2007. At the
corporate level, ASEAN has embraced a vision for the future---the ASEAN
Community 2015---and efforts are underway to frame a charter for the
next ASEAN summit in November [2007 which will give the organization
legal underpinnings for the first time ever. However, these developments
do not mean that this observer has adopted a pollyannaish view of
Southeast Asia. The glass is half empty in the sense that the region
faces a host of serious security challenges, particularly transnational
threats such as terrorism; communal and sectarian violence; and illegal
trafficking in drugs, small arms, and people.]{.underline} Politically,
the September 19, 2006, coup in Thailand, and continued rumors of coups
in the Philippines, underscored the fragility of democratic institutions
in Southeast Asia. Except for one or two countries, poor
governance---corruption, lack of transparency and accountability,
political instability, absence of rule of law, and ineffective
government---remains widespread across the region. And while Aceh is a
success story, the level of violence in Southern Thailand is escalating
at an alarming rate.2 [Moreover, some countries in Southeast Asia show
characteristics of near-state failure, with Burma being the leading
example. And while ASEAN has adopted a clear blueprint for the future,
it remains to be seen whether the radical proposals suggested at the
ASEAN Summit in Cebu, the Philippines, in January 2007]{.underline},
will survive the negotiations and expected opposition from newer members
such as Burma.

Moreover[, while the United States has been hesitant about forging
lasting multilateral security partnerships in the East Asian region, it
has continued to seek greater economic integration. In recent years
Japan and South Korea have both demonstrated a growing enthusiasm for
free trade agreements]{.underline} (FTAs) to promote greater economic
integration with the United States and other regions of the globe. Japan
has already concluded FTA [agreements with Mexico, Singapore, and
Malaysia while South Korea has negotiated agreements with Chile and
Singapore]{.underline}. Support for free trade has been an important
component of American economic diplomacy in recent years, primarily
because it serves the interests of some important political
constituencies that are important to the Bush administration[. By
signing FTAs with Australia, Singapore, and South Korea, the United
States has in fact been able to increase its exports to Asia during the
last several years. Continued efforts to negotiate FTAs both between the
United States and different Asian countries and among the Asian
countries themselves can potentially create a region-wide free trade
zone]{.underline} and multilateral cooperation on economic issues if not
security issues.19
