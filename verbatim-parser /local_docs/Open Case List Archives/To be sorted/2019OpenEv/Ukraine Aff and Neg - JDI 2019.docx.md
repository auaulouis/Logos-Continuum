### Plan

The United States federal government should substantially reduce Direct
Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of lethal aid to Ukraine
from the United States

### Russia

#### squo US lethal aid to ukraine make conflict inevitable

**Shabbir, 6/6/**19 (Fahad, US must stop acting recklessly, engaging in
disputes on russian border - state senator., Sputnik, retrieved from
ProQuest)

WASHINGTON, June 6 (Sputnik) - [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has
become]{.mark} very [irresponsible]{.mark} as it engages in disputes [on
the Russian border and should stop]{.mark} such [provocative
actions]{.mark} given the chance [that]{.mark} something [can]{.mark} go
wrong and [trigger a thermonuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}, Virginia
State Senator Richard Black told Sputnik.

In May, the US Senate Armed Services Committee approved a draft 2020
defense budget that allocates \$300 million for security aid to Ukraine.
[[Russia]{.mark} has repeatedly [warned]{.mark} the United States that
[sending arms to Ukraine will only fuel the conflict]{.mark},
destabilize the country and lead to more bloodshed]{.underline}​​​.

[\"We really have become very reckless in getting involved in disputes
that are right on the Russian border,\" Black said]{.underline}. \"The
president and our government need to always be mindful that while we may
be overwhelmingly powerful in terms of our economy and controlling the
banking system and so forth that [[Russia has nearly the same number
of]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark} that we have. We should not be
reckless and should not be provocative on the Russian
border]{.underline}. Because there is always a chance that something
goes wrong.\"

Black said there is a chance, however small, that [a thermonuclear war
may be inadvertently triggered in which every major city in United
States and Russia would be destroyed]{.underline}.

\"Is that worth being reckless? I don't think so,\" Black said.

Black said [[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates always
[starts]{.mark} out [by saying it will provide non-lethal aid]{.mark} to
partner states, [but then]{.mark} almost immediately [begins to provide
weapons and]{.mark} in that way [creates a constituency for
war]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

\"That is just a way these things are done,\" Black said. \"The problem
is [[once you start providing Javelin anti-tank
missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is what we are talking about in
large measure, [you develop [a constituency]{.mark} that [lobbies for
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The more weapons you provide, the more
weapons manufacturers want war]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

Last week, US Special Representative for Ukraine Negotiations Kurt
Volker said that Washington is open to new military sales to Ukraine to
help maintain the country\'s defense capabilities and continues to
negotiate with Kiev on the provision of military supplies.

#### Deterrence fails -- United States assurances lack credibility because of higher Russian investment in the territory

Implications,\" Real Clear Defense, 9-5-2018,

dw

[America's]{.underline} recent [decision to authorize the sale and
delivery of Javelin anti-tank missile systems to Ukraine was
shortsighted and dangerous]{.underline} [to all]{.underline} parties
involved.\[1\] [The provision of the Javelin weapons
system]{.underline}, in particular, [serves as little more than a
symbolic gesture]{.underline}. In the end, the authorization will likely
prove a maneuver in optics, not strategy. Furthermore, recent
developments suggest the Ukrainian government, in an effort to secure
the deal, may have interfered with the ongoing special counsel
investigation in the United States.\[2\] The following delineates the
reasoning behind this conclusion, puts forward some of the stronger
arguments in favor of the authorization, and describes why they are
misguided. [Amid the fraught U.S.-Russia relations of late, it is vital
for American policymakers to consider each geopolitical decision with
the utmost care]{.underline}, ensuring the best interests of the United
States and \[its\] ~~her~~ allies are always kept in mind.\[3\] [An
appropriate policy would include forgoing any further sale of lethal
weaponry, replacing it instead with increased funds and non-lethal
materiel such as counter-electronic warfare]{.underline} (EW)
[technology and the deployment of additional troops on a strictly
train-and-advise basis. The conflict in]{.underline} Eastern [Ukraine
has claimed over 10,000 lives and forced over a million more to flee
their homes]{.underline}.\[4\] Taking these figures into consideration[,
it is evident that decisive action is necessary]{.underline}; thus far,
[however, the United States has taken the wrong approach]{.underline}.
[Arming]{.underline} Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank missiles [runs the
risk of reigniting what has become a relatively static engagement
between the Ukrainian Army and Russian-backed
separatists.\[]{.underline}5\] Skirmishes occur on a daily basis, and
casualties continue to accrue, but [a sudden injection of Western
munitions into the hands of the Ukrainian Army is likely to prompt a
disproportionate response from the side of the Russians]{.underline}, a
reaction [not without historical precedence]{.underline}.\[6\] [Assuming
the Russians respond]{.underline} not in kind, but [with asymmetric
force, where does that leave the United States?]{.underline} Is the
United States to perpetually provide bigger and better arms as the
process persists in some sort of vicious iteration of Robert Jervis's
spiral model?\[7\] For now, [Russia has far more at stake]{.underline}
in this conflict. With his population's support and at least six more
years at the helm, Vladimir Putin can and will broaden his country's
efforts in the region if need be.\[8\] Even if the United States were
committed to meet every response with more firepower, [the Russians have
the overwhelming advantage of geography. Russia's shared border with
Ukraine, one that is reportedly near-impossible to effectively monitor,
enables expedited resupplies]{.underline}.\[9\] [Putin's]{.underline}
relative [autonomy]{.underline} [in]{.underline} terms of foreign policy
[decisions also adds to the potential for a rapid response.]{.underline}
Furthermore, [it is prudent to consider how Ukrainians may interpret the
signaling of receiving lethal arms from America]{.underline}. Inspired
by the renewed and augmented support of the Americans,
[this]{.underline} move [could embolden Ukrainians to begin launching
assaults, thus producing an avoidable escalation scenario]{.underline}.
[Many like to frame the conversation as providing so-called **defensive
weapons rather than offensive, but in reality, there is no logical
distinction between the two**]{.underline}.\[10\] [The Ukrainians using
these weapons to go on an offensive]{.underline}, making the U.S. an
indirect accomplice in violating the Minsk Agreement, [remains a real
possibility and a real concern of those monitoring the situation
closely.\[]{.underline}11\] From a purely practical standpoint,
providing Ukraine with Javelins makes little sense. While [the provision
of such weapons would certainly generate substantial repercussions due
to the symbolism of the action, their usefulness on the battlefield
would be virtually imperceptible]{.underline}. In fact, former commander
of U.S. Army Europe remarked in 2015 that the Ukrainian Army having
Javelin missiles "would not change the situation strategically in a
positive way."\[12\] [Ukraine has no need for Javelin missiles, as it
already produces its own comparable varieties of anti-tank
weaponry.\[]{.underline}13\] The Ukrainian Army is well-equipped for
situations that require anti-tank capabilities, thus it is redundant to
provide them with more. Furthermore, [the conflict has largely steered
away from tank warfare, further highlighting the superfluity of Javelin
sales]{.underline}.\[14\] The provision of other lethal arms in general
is similarly excessive. Since the outbreak of the conflict, [the
Ukrainian Army has improved its capabilities in almost every aspect of
warfare by orders of magnitude.]{.underline} [Ukraine's current air,
land, and sea means are unrecognizable in comparison to]{.underline}
those of [2014]{.underline}.\[15\] If anything, the United States should
be increasing support to help Ukraine counter the innovative electronic
warfare the Russian-backed separatists are waging in the east.\[16\] An
electronic warfare package would be immensely more advantageous to the
effort in Ukraine. The package could include products such as the THOR
III, CREW jammer, or MODI II systems, as well as a contingent of U.S.
electronic warfare specialists to train Ukrainian soldiers using a
strategy akin to the one released by the Pentagon in 2017.\[17\] This
recent Department of Defense approach lays emphasis on the integration
of burgeoning electronic warfare capabilities throughout the gamut of
military operations, the use of cost-effective technology in lieu of
conventional arms, and the coordination of preparedness training for the
rigors of conflict in the electromagnetic spectrum.\[18\] These systems,
among others, could make a genuine difference in an electronic warfare
space currently dominated by the Russians.\[19\] As an added benefit,
Ukrainian troops could later be debriefed by their American counterparts
on how the technology fared in real-world application against the
current leader in electronic warfare tactics, providing valuable insight
to be used in future strategic planning. To further assist, the United
States could take the advice of a February 2018 Carnegie report, which
suggests the problem the Ukrainian Army faces now is not one of
hardware, but of structure, and a key component of successful reform is
the expansion of Western training efforts.\[20\] It is also imperative
to acknowledge the likelihood of American-made weapons systems winding
up in the hands other than those for whom they were intended. Time and
again, [U.S.-supplied weapons are either stolen from the anticipated
beneficiary or never make it there in the first place]{.underline}. In
just the last decade, this happened in Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan,
Somalia, Yemen, and Mexico.\[21\] In Ukraine, [the worry would be that
the Javelins provided by America could make their way into the arms of
either some sort of extremist Ukrainian militia]{.underline} such as the
Azov Battalion [or the very same Russian-backed separatists the weapons
were meant to combat]{.underline}.\[22\] [The Ukrainian Army has lost
control of countless weapons that have then found their way onto the
streets and online marketplaces.]{.underline}\[23\] In one instance,
Ukrainian Army vehicles were taken by separatists in broad daylight and
subsequently paraded about.\[24\] More importantly, non-lethal U.S.
military equipment, such as mortar-tracking radar technology given to
Ukraine in 2015, was stolen by the separatists not long after
delivery.\[25\] [Assuming such a risk with lethal weaponry is needless
and should, under present circumstances, be avoided.]{.underline} The
advocates of arming Ukraine cite a number of well-intentioned, yet
nebulous and, in some cases, erroneous motives for their position. The
primary argument is that the United States must support the independence
of a democratic, potential future NATO member.\[26\] The problem with
this particular belief is that the United States is and has been
supporting the independence of Ukraine for years.\[27\] Since the outset
of the conflict, [the United States has provided over \$1.3 billion in
monetary assistance, training, and non-lethal materiel such as radar,
surveillance, and vehicles]{.underline}.\[28\] As argued above, [there
is no practical need for the provision of lethal arms, so the support
for Ukrainian independence is,]{.underline} in effect, [being
realized]{.underline}. Another argument for arming Ukraine is that doing
so strengthens NATO; however, one can argue persuasively that Ukraine is
doing just fine without American anti-tank missiles.\[29\] In the same
vein as the strengthening NATO argument, champions for the arming of
Ukraine insist that lethal arms from America will enhance European
security. [European allies of the United States tend to have a different
opinion]{.underline}.\[30\] Representatives of countries located within
Europe, such as the former president of [France]{.underline}, Francois
Hollande; [German]{.underline} [Chancellor]{.underline}, Angela
[Merkel]{.underline}; and [U.K.]{.underline} national security
[official]{.underline}, Mark [Sedwell]{.underline}, [have publicly
stated their qualms with a U.S.-provided lethal arms
package]{.underline}, echoing the concerns outlined above.\[31\] Also
coming from within Europe, the European Council on Foreign Relations has
published objections to the idea.\[32\] In a broader sense, current
French president Emmanuel Macron has recently called for Europe to
achieve greater defense autonomy and rely less on the United States. In
his remarks, he suggested a move towards security cooperation with the
Russian Federation if the situation in Donbas deescalates.\[33\] ARMING
UKRAINE IS SYMBOLICALLY MORAL, BUT CHANCES AN INCREASE IN HOSTILITIES
THAT COULD DEVOLVE INTO A TIT-FOR-TAT PROXY WAR, OR WORSE. [There is no
rational basis for providing Ukraine with]{.underline} Javelin missile
systems, or [any]{.underline} other [lethalweaponry]{.underline}. Such a
move has no positive effect for the Ukrainians on the battlefield.
Instead, [the United States is undertaking several wholly preventable
risks with the prospect of realizing zero strategic ends]{.underline}.
The Ukrainian armed forces are capable of sustaining their mission
domestically. [Arming Ukraine is symbolically moral, but **chances an
increase in hostilities that could devolve into a tit-for-tat proxy war,
or worse.**]{.underline} [An entirely new U.S. policy towards Ukraine is
**unnecessary**.]{.underline} Rather, the existing policy of supporting
Ukraine is in need of amending, which can be achieved by a collaborative
approach on the part of Congress and the executive branch. A
three-pronged strategy is the best means of modifying the current U.S.
strategy. First and foremost, [the U.S. must transition from the
provision of lethal means]{.underline}, to non-lethal aid paired with an
advisory presence focused on countering Russian electronic warfare
capabilities. Next, in lieu of any further weapons deals, Congress
should author and pass a bill that allocates increased funds to be used
in providing Ukraine with non-lethal materiel, surveillance drones, and,
most importantly, counter-electronic warfare technology. Finally,
Congress should petition the president to authorize not only the
aforementioned equipment-provision bill, but also the deployment of
additional troops, with a non-combat mandate, to assist the Ukrainian
military with training and structural reforms.

#### Increased weapons sales embolden Ukrainian forces without improving military capabilities

**Milakovsky** **2017**

August 28, 2017 Brian Milakovsky works for humanitarian organizations in
eastern Ukraine "The Real Danger of Sending U.S. Arms to Ukraine"
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-real-danger-sending-us-arms-ukraine-22088?page=0%2C1
In 2015, after spending several months in the frontline zone I wrote
that [Ukraine desperately needs a "lousy peace" and **not an arms
race**]{.underline}. Two years and several thousand deaths later, the
idea of supplying Ukraine with U.S. arms has resurfaced. As a
humanitarian worker whose greatest desire is to see the intolerable
misery of Ukrainian civilians come to an end, I grapple with these
questions: Would American arms increase the price of Russian aggression,
causing Moscow to scale back its military project in the Donbass and
saving civilian lives? Or would they incite a new round of escalation
and a flood of new arms into the region? The stakes of this question are
incredibly high for Donbass civilians. With both sides placing their
heavy artillery adjacent to residential areas (according to the head of
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)
monitoring mission in the region), every escalation means more death and
destruction for a population already traumatized by three years of war
and civil strife. I get no pleasure from the idea of Ukrainian soldiers,
the men and women I see every day at checkpoints, being outgunned by
Russian-armed separatists and the barely concealed Russian army. But
while I hope that anti-tank Javelin rockets be used to hold Russian
aggression at bay and save civilian lives, I believe we must consider
other scenarios of how the addition of U.S. arms could affect this
conflict. Russian aggression is the fundamental cause, and every move
Ukraine makes (defensive or offensive) is inherently a reaction to it.
But this does not necessarily mean that Russia is the source of each new
spike of violence in the conflict zone. I travel to frontline towns
several times a week, and frequently ask residents which side starts the
exchanges of artillery that crisscross above their heads. The general
answer is "sometimes this side, sometimes that." You can get the same
conclusion from following the technically detailed but judgment-free
patrolling reports by the OSCE.

[There is reason to believe that the **two largest escalation**
events]{.underline} so far [in 2017 began with a "creeping
offensive]{.underline}" [**by Ukrainian forces** to improve their
positions along the frontlines]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} an
[understandable]{.underline} move for soldiers pinned under enemy fire
in vulnerable positions, [but it]{.underline} may have
**[triggered]{.underline}** the [**massive firefights**]{.underline}
near the Svitlodarsk Bulge and between the warring sides in Avdiivka and
Donetsk that took a dozen civilian lives and spread destruction on both
sides of the front. [Importantly, almost **none of the advances were
sustained**]{.underline}.

A Ukrainian battalion commander told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty how
his soldiers snuck into a no-man's-land village outside Svitlodarsk
called Novoluhanske and set up positions near the main employer, a pig
farm. That night the separatists understood what had happened and began
shelling the Ukrainian forces---and the farm, which was badly damaged as
shelling continued into May. Just a small stretch of gardens separates
the farm from the village, which itself has come under fire. I have
spent much time in that area. In the winter of 2014--15 residents lived
through the hellish "artillery duel" when the separatists and Ukrainian
army pounded each other's towns with shells and rockets. Later I helped
re-equip a bombed and looted kindergarten and replace the
shrapnel-scarred roof of the community center. The idea of death flying
into these towns again, after they have slowly pieced together a normal
life and gathered money from parents to hold the kindergarten pageant,
overwhelms me. I am not suggesting that the Ukrainian forces as the sole
guilty party in the continuing violence, especially considering Russia's
fundamental aggression. But whereas [the creeping offensive was **well
discussed**]{.underline} [in Ukrainian media and]{.underline} [**even
bragged about**, I worry whether advocates are considering it when they
calculate how U.S. arms will be used.]{.underline} And while we might
recognize the basic moral right of the Ukrainian army to reclaim
occupied land, our government has also repeatedly stated its commitment
to the Minsk accords, which commit Ukraine and the separatist forces to
(thus far unsuccessful) de-escalation.

[Many]{.underline} voices [in the government]{.underline} [and
press]{.underline} [have been telling the Ukrainian people]{.underline}
for three years that [U.S. arms will be a game changer]{.underline}. One
parliamentarian and military volunteer claimed that "with American
weapons, we'll push the Russians back to Siberia." Also, a military
commander recently told the Daily Signal, "If the U.S. sends weapons, it
would completely change the war the next day." [Given these claims,
Kyiv]{.underline} [might feel it must capitalize on the arms transfers
to shift the balance on the front]{.underline}. [The Pentagon is
considering providing Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank
rockets]{.underline}, which are considered defensive. But [such weapons
could be used to cover an advance into the separatist-held territories
defended by Russian tanks]{.underline}.

Some might hope that a Ukrainian advance would bring a [conclusion to
the war.]{.underline} But that **[is unlikely to be the result of
any]{.underline}** such **[offensive]{.underline}**, be it creeping or
galloping. [In August, 2014]{.underline} [the Ukrainian army drove deep
into the]{.underline} so-called "[People's Republics]{.underline},"
[cutting Donetsk off from Luhansk and beginning to encircle them along
the Russian border]{.underline}. The civilian casualties were awful as
both sides reduced villages and city districts to rubble. I thought to
myself, "This is horrific, but if it brings this war to an end, maybe
it's for the best."

It didn't. Most observers agree that [the tide was turned by
massive]{.underline}, **[direct Russian military
intervention]{.underline}**, [which threw back the Ukrainian forces and
culminated in the death of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers]{.underline}
at the Ilovaisk encirclement. [Five months later Russia's direct
involvement]{.underline} [again shifted the military
balance]{.underline}, [allowing the separatists to occupy the
strategic]{.underline} and nearly destroyed [cities]{.underline} [of
Debaltseve and Vuhlehirsk.]{.underline}

Would a Ukrainian advance produce a different outcome today? A year ago
[Elena Racheva from the independent Russian newspaper]{.underline}
Novaya Gazeta [interviewed]{.underline} [soldiers and
civilians]{.underline} on both sides of the frontlines. She reported on
the [mutual military buildup]{.underline} [and the]{.underline} **[itchy
desire of frontline troops]{.underline}** [on both sides to go on the
offensive]{.underline}. [This would set off a bloodbath]{.underline},
she wrote, "And if war returns, no one that I talked to will remain
alive." Evgeny Shibalov, an activist who provided emergency humanitarian
assistance to his neighbors in Donetsk before being deported by the
separatist authorities, related to me that in the first artillery
exchanges on the outskirts of Donetsk ambulance records showed one
military death to twenty-five civilians. As the sides have settled into
more defined positions that civilian casualty ratio has dropped
considerably. But Shibalov is deeply unnerved by frequent talk in Kyiv
and the Ukrainian media about emulating Operation Storm, a military
operation conducted by the NATO-backed Croatian and Bosnian forces that
drove Serbian separatists from the Krajina region. The modest arms
transfers proposed by the Pentagon are unlikely to inspire the Ukrainian
army to make such a bold assault, but any significant move to redraw the
frontline could incite the kind of massive civilian casualties not seen
since the terrible summer of 2014.

[We also must consider how Moscow will interpret the "language of
force."]{.underline} [Proponents]{.underline} of arming Ukraine [claim
it will send home more dead Russian soldiers]{.underline}, thus
[demonstrating]{.underline} [to Putin that he cannot prop up the
separatists with impunity]{.underline}. [Seeing this U.S. resolve, he
will reduce Russian provocations]{.underline} in Ukraine. But perhaps
[if we are underestimating the tolerance of Putin and his elite for the
death of their soldiers and the numerous Ukrainian and Russian
"volunteers" in the frontline trenches]{.underline}. I lived in Russia
for the first year and a half of the Ukraine crisis and experienced the
totality of Moscow's information campaign. I left believing
[Putin]{.underline} had [**staked his legitimacy** with the Russian
public on this confrontation with America]{.underline}. [Military defeat
or even significant military setback for the separatists would be defeat
for Moscow, only compounded onto a geopolitical scale.]{.underline}

I fear that [Putin's understanding of the language of force will be
entirely different]{.underline}. [**Regardless of the actual impact** of
Javelin rockets]{.underline}, [he could regard U.S. arms transfers as a
**symbolic test** of who dictates conditions in the Donbass
warzone]{.underline}. He could [counter with a new wave of military
hardware to demonstrate his resolve]{.underline}. [The result could be
a]{.underline} miniature [arms race]{.underline} with lots of artillery
being fired symbolically into the homes of living, breathing Donbass
civilians. And that means death and shattered lives, destroyed homes and
livelihoods, and descent into basement bomb shelters and root
cellars---where hope for a normal life rots in the dark. Two years of
working in frontline communities has shown me that while the current
status quo is awful, civilians have so much to lose. I visited the towns
near the Svitlodarsk bulge for the first time in March 2015. Gaping
windows, cratered walls and smashed storefronts greeted the eye
everywhere. Many whitewashed little houses were blasted into rubble.
Today, with the efforts of Ukrainian volunteers, international NGOs and
competent administrators the scars of war are barely visible. Small
factories and workshops are re-opening and looking for workers. In
Stanytsia Luhanska, the rural suburb of Luhansk that was ruthlessly
shelled by both sides, small farmers are returning from refuge elsewhere
in Ukraine or Russia, filling in bomb craters in their massive gardens
and repairing destroyed greenhouses. They sell their tomatoes and
cucumbers through the "border crossing" to Luhansk, using the proceeds
to fix their homes and repay debts accrued from two years without a
harvest. "Of course we want to live like we did before the war," I
constantly hear. "But the way it is now, we can survive. Just so that
the war doesn't come back." I know many proponents of sending arms to
Ukraine sincerely believe it will check Russian aggression and save
lives. If the sales go forward and it indeed helps reduce violence in
the frontline zone, I will be delighted to have been wrong. But if this
move instead triggers escalation and subjects Donbass civilians to a new
round of death and misery, will proponents still be paying attention?

#### Russia views arms sales as provocative -- deterrence strategies in Ukraine empirically fail

University's Saltzman Institute Of War And Peace Studies William Ruger
Vice President For Research And Policy At The Charles Koch Institute And
An Officer In The U.S. Navy Reserve October 11, 2017 "The Trouble With
Arming Ukraine"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2017-10-11/trouble-arming-ukraine

It's long past time for the United States to provide Ukraine the lethal
defensive assistance it needs to deter and defend against further
Russian aggression," said Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) in August---and
not for the first time. McCain is arguably the most influential person
in Congress on national security matters, so his words carry weight. But
his is hardly a lone voice. Others, including John Herbst, who was U.S.
ambassador to Ukraine from mid-2003 to mid-2006, and Alexander Vershbow,
an experienced American diplomat and deputy general secretary of NATO
from early 2012 until October 2016, agree with McCain. So do former
President Bill Clinton's deputy secretary of state, Strobe Talbott, and
a cluster of diplomatic and national security luminaries, who came out
of the gate early on this issue in a report released in 2015.

The efforts of these individuals haven't been in vain. U.S. President
Donald Trump will soon decide whether to implement their proposal, and
key members of his national security and military team favor doing so,
according to recent statements from General Joseph Dunford, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Kurt Volker, Trump's top negotiator on
the Ukraine crisis. Defense Secretary James Mattis has confirmed that
the option was being "actively reviewed."

[Those who call for sending lethal arms to Ukraine]{.underline} (the
United States and some of its NATO allies already train Ukrainian
troops, and the United States has been providing nonlethal arms to
Ukraine to the tune of \$300 million in 2016 alone) claim that American
weaponry will strengthen Kiev's hand and compel Russian President
Vladimir Putin to negotiate a just political settlement that ends the
war in Ukraine's Donbas region.

They'[re]{.underline} [misguided]{.underline}. Worse, [their proposal
could be dangerous, for Ukraine and the United States.]{.underline}

**[Arming Ukraine won't make Putin cry uncle.]{.underline}** [Past
experience]{.underline}---[notably Moscow's stepped-up
intervention]{.underline} to save its Donbas clients in the battles for
Ilovaisk and Novoazovsk in 2014 and 2015 and Debaltseve in
2015---[suggests that Putin will continue to reinforce Russia's
proxies]{.underline}, [especially if they suffer setbacks at the hands
of better-armed Ukrainian troops]{.underline}.

[Because Russia and Ukraine share a border]{.underline}, [Putin can send
forces and weapons to the battlefield]{.underline} **[far
faster]{.underline}** [than the United States can resupply]{.underline}
Ukraine. Most importantly, **[Ukraine matters far more to Russia than to
the United States]{.underline}**. Indeed, even the advocates for arming
Ukraine disavow any intention to send American troops to fight for the
Ukrainians, knowing full well that such a recommendation would doom
their efforts.

By contrast, [Putin hasn't hesitated to order Russian troops into battle
in the Donbas]{.underline}, [where many have been killed]{.underline}.
[His popularity]{.underline} ratings nevertheless [remain
sky-high]{.underline}. Eighty-seven percent of Russians support his
handling of foreign affairs---about the same as did in 2014. There is no
evidence that the war in Ukraine has dented Putin's popularity, let
alone enabled opposition leaders to mobilize support against his
government. Yet proponents of providing Ukraine lethal arms suggest that
because of the bite of Western sanctions and Russians' mounting
unhappiness with the war, Putin desperately wants to escape what they
portray as the Donbas quagmire.

In fact, [although Russia has now endured political
isolation]{.underline} [and Western economic penalties]{.underline} for
over three years [as a consequence of Putin's annexation of
Crimea]{.underline} and instigation of the war in eastern Ukraine, **[he
has not made a single significant concession]{.underline}** [or shown
any inclination to sacrifice the Donbas insurgents]{.underline}.
Instead, [he has stuck by them]{.underline} and, as his military
escalations in 2014 and 2015 show, bailed them out when necessary.

[The proposition]{.underline} that [Putin won't be provoked
by]{.underline} a U.S. decision to send [lethal arms]{.underline} to
Ukraine **[amounts to a hunch]{.underline}**. [It's not supported by
evidence]{.underline}, **[and Putin's past behavior contradicts
it]{.underline}**. This is not a minor point: [if he does ramp up the
war]{.underline} [and the Ukrainian army is forced into
retreat]{.underline}, [the United States will face three bad
choices]{.underline}.

First, Washington could [pour even more arms into Ukraine]{.underline}
in hopes of concentrating Putin's mind; [but he can easily provide
additional firepower]{.underline} to the Donbas insurgents. [Second, it
could deepen its military]{.underline} [involvement]{.underline} by
sending American military advisers, or even troops, to the frontline to
bolster the Ukrainian army; [but then Russia could call America's
bluff]{.underline}. [Third, the United States could decide not to
respond]{.underline} to Russia's escalation given the geographical
disadvantage and the limited strategic interests at stake. [That would
amount to backing down]{.underline}, [abandoning Ukraine]{.underline},
[and shredding the oft-repeated argument that American and European
security hinges on the outcome of the Donbas war]{.underline}.

Proponents of arming Ukraine say that things will never reach this point
because their goal is merely to force a political settlement that's
acceptable to Ukrainians and ends a war that has killed some 10,000
people. The point, they insist, isn't to empower Kiev to crush the
Donbas rebels, and they dismiss the possibility that an American-armed
Ukraine might be emboldened to attempt just that.

Yet in a speech at West Point in September, Ukrainian President Petro
Poroshenko declared that his intent was precisely to retake the Donbas
(a point that he also made earlier in July and again in October), and he
noted that American weapons would help him succeed. Surely, Poroshenko's
words matter more than breezy assurances from those pushing to arm
Ukraine.

The [supporters of arming Ukraine also shortchange that country\'s
military capabilities]{.underline}. [The Ukrainian army has nearly
doubled in size]{.underline}, from 130,000 in 2014 to 250,000 today,
[and is now one of Europe's largest]{.underline}. In 2018, Ukraine's
military spending will increase by a quarter to \$6.3 billion (or five
percent of GDP), more than double the 2014 figure.

In addition to the increases in defense spending and the size of its
army, [Kiev has taken other steps to beef up its security]{.underline}.
[The draft was reinstituted]{.underline} in 2014. [Ukraine has been
improving its command, control, surveillance, and intelligence
network]{.underline} [and acquiring more, and better trained, special
operations forces.]{.underline} With help from NATO's Comprehensive
Assistance Package, which was adopted in 2016, it is revamping the
administration of its armed forces.

True, there are many obstacles to transforming Ukraine's military,
corruption among them. The goal of bringing it up to NATO standards by
2020 may amount to wishful thinking. And progress will be slow under the
best of circumstances. Yet the Ukrainian army of today is certainly not
what it was in 2014---a shell.

What's more, [Ukraine is no slouch in building weapons]{.underline}.
Ukroboronprom, [the state weapons manufacturer]{.underline}, [employs
80,000 people and oversees 21 affiliates]{.underline}, and there are
some 36 private Ukrainian defense firms besides. [Ukraine makes advanced
tanks, armored amphibious vehicles]{.underline}, [aerial refueling
tankers, transport aircraft, laser-guided anti-tank
missiles]{.underline} (which get top billing in proposals to arm
Ukraine, never mind that Ukraine makes the Corsar and Stugna-P
laser-guided ATGMs), [and long-range early-warning radars]{.underline}.
Moreover, [Ukraine was the world's ninth-largest arms exporter from 2012
to 2016]{.underline}. It earned over \$500 million selling arms last
year and a total of \$11 billion since it became an independent country.
In short, [the clamor to arm Ukraine may have less to do with its dire
need for weapons than with **drawing the United States deeper into the
conflict**]{.underline}

[Supporters]{.underline} of arming Ukraine [insist]{.underline} that
[this move is also essential for reassuring NATO]{.underline} [and
preserving Europe's peace]{.underline}. Yet [the
proposition]{.underline} that [the United States]{.underline} [should
risk]{.underline} getting enmeshed in a [war]{.underline} on Russia's
doorstep [to soothe]{.underline} its [skittish NATO states **makes no
sense**]{.underline}. [Article V of]{.underline} the pact's treaty
**[already provides]{.underline}** that [a member]{.underline} [that
comes under attack will be defended]{.underline}, with military force if
needed. Moreover, although Trump declared NATO "obsolete," he later
reversed himself, and there is every reason to believe that his
administration remains committed to the transatlantic alliance.

If NATO truly seeks to become stronger and Europe is indeed so
vulnerable and edgy, the alliance's wealthy European members should take
some big steps at home, such as boosting defense spending. Although some
have, many have not. The alliance's figures show that only five of its
27 European states now spend two percent or more of their GDP on
defense, the target accepted in 2006. NATO's European members also have
much work to do on other fronts. These include reducing duplication in
the production of major armaments and increasing inter-operability and
the capabilities for the rapid deployment of forces to the battlefield.
Substantial progress in these areas, not reassurances about Washington's
dependability as demonstrated by the dispatch of American arms to
Ukraine, are what the alliance needs.

[The case for arming Ukraine]{.underline} also [tends to be made in a
vacuum]{.underline}, [never mind that what the United States does in
Ukraine]{.underline} [could determine what Russia does
elsewhere]{.underline}. [Moscow]{.underline} [could respond by putting
more pressure on the Baltics]{.underline}, [acting as a spoiler in
**North Korea** or **Iran**, or even **arming the Taliban**]{.underline}
(that would be an ironic turn: in the 1980s, the United States bled the
Soviets by arming the Afghan mujahideen). If these outcomes seem
impossible, [consider the United States' awful record in foreseeing the
effects of its military moves]{.underline}. In [Vietnam]{.underline},
[Kosovo]{.underline}, [Afghanistan]{.underline}, [Iraq]{.underline},
[and Libya]{.underline}, adversaries didn't respond the way Washington
anticipated, or there were dangerous unintended consequences. Russia,
for its part, surprised the United States by sending its troops into
Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and Syria in 2015.

All in all, the plan to pressure Putin by providing Ukraine lethal arms
is strategically flawed. Worse, it could prove reckless.

#### The conflict would escalate---Ukraine is the vital strategic interest 

**Mearsheimer**, a professor of political science at the University of
Chicago, **15** (John J., Don\'t Arm Ukraine, New York Times, February
8, <https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/09/opinion/dont-arm-ukraine.html>)

[The Ukraine crisis is almost a year old and Russia is
winning]{.underline}. The separatists in eastern Ukraine are gaining
ground and Russia's president, Vladimir V. [[Putin, shows no signs of
backing down]{.mark} in the face of Western economic
sanctions]{.underline}.

[Unsurprisingly, [a growing chorus of voices]{.mark} in the United
States [is calling for arming Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. A recent
report from three leading American think tanks endorses sending Kiev
advanced weaponry, and the White House's nominee for secretary of
defense, Ashton B. Carter, said last week to the Senate armed services
committee, "I very much incline in that direction."

[[They are wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Going down that road would be a
huge mistake for the United States, NATO and Ukraine itself. [Sending
weapons]{.mark} to Ukraine will not rescue its army and [will]{.mark}
instead lead to an [escalat]{.mark}ion in the
[fighting]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Such a step is especially dangerous
because [Russia has thousands of nuclear weapons]{.mark} and is seeking
[to defend a vital strategic interest]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There is no question that Ukraine's military is badly outgunned by the
[separatists]{.underline}, who [have Russian troops and weapons on their
side]{.underline}. [Because [the balance of power decisively favors
Moscow]{.mark}, Washington would have to send large amounts of equipment
for Ukraine's army to have a fighting chance]{.underline}.

[But [the conflict will not end there]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Russia
would counter-escalate, taking away any temporary
benefit]{.underline}]{.mark} [Kiev might get [from American
arms]{.mark}]{.underline}. The authors of the think tank study concede
this, noting that "even with enormous support from the West, the
Ukrainian Army will not be able to defeat a determined attack by the
Russian military." In short, [[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [cannot win an arms race with Russia]{.mark} over
Ukraine]{.underline} and thereby ensure Russia's defeat on the
battlefield.

[[Proponents]{.mark} of arming Ukraine have a second line of argument.
The key to success, they [maintain]{.mark}, is not to defeat Russia
militarily, but to raise the costs of fighting to the point
where]{.underline} Mr. [[Putin will cave]{.underline}]{.mark}. The pain
will supposedly compel Moscow to withdraw its troops from Ukraine and
allow it to join the European Union and NATO and become an ally of the
West.

[[This]{.mark} coercive [strategy is]{.mark} also [unlikely to
work]{.mark}, no matter how much punishment the West
inflicts]{.underline}. [What advocates of arming Ukraine fail to
understand is that [Russian leaders believe]{.mark} their country's
[core strategic interests are at stake in Ukraine; they are unlikely to
give ground, even if it means absorbing huge costs]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Great powers react harshly when]{.mark} distant [rivals project
military power into their neighborhood]{.mark}, much less attempt to
make a country on their border an ally]{.underline}. This is why the
United States has the Monroe Doctrine, and today no American leader
would ever tolerate Canada or Mexico joining a military alliance headed
by another great power.

[[Russia is no exception]{.underline}]{.mark} in this regard. Thus Mr.
[Putin has not budged in the face of sanctions and is unlikely to make
meaningful concessions if the costs of the fighting in Ukraine
increase]{.underline}.

[[Upping the ante in Ukraine]{.mark} also [risks]{.mark} unwanted
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Not only would the fighting in
eastern Ukraine be sure to intensify, but it could also spread to other
areas]{.underline}. The consequences for Ukraine, which already faces
profound economic and social problems, would be disastrous.

The possibility that Mr. [Putin might end up making nuclear
threats]{.underline} may seem remote, but if the goal of arming Ukraine
is to drive up the costs of Russian interference and eventually put
Moscow in an acute situation, it cannot be ruled out. [[If]{.mark}
Western pressure succeeded and]{.underline} Mr. [[Putin felt desperate,
he would have a powerful incentive to]{.mark} try to rescue the
situation by [rattl]{.mark}ing [the nuclear saber]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Our understanding of the mechanisms of escalation in crises and war is
limited at best, although we know the risks are considerable.
[Pushing]{.mark} a nuclear-armed [Russia into a corner would be playing
with fire]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Advocates]{.mark} of arming Ukraine recognize the escalation problem,
which is why they [stress]{.mark} giving Kiev ["defensive," not
"offensive," weapons]{.mark}. Unfortunately, [there is no useful
distinction]{.mark} between these categories: All weapons can be used
for attacking and defending]{.underline}. The West can be sure, though,
that [[Moscow will not see]{.mark} those [American weapons as
"defensive]{.mark}," given that Washington is determined to reverse the
status quo in eastern Ukraine]{.underline}.

The only way to solve the Ukraine crisis is diplomatically, not
militarily. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, seems to recognize that
fact, as she has said Germany will not ship arms to Kiev. Her problem,
however, is that she does not know how to bring the crisis to an end.

She and other European [leaders still labor under the delusion that
Ukraine can be pulled out of Russia's orbit and incorporated into the
West, and that Russian leaders must accept that outcome. They will
not]{.underline}.

To save Ukraine and eventually restore a working relationship with
Moscow, the West should seek to make Ukraine a neutral buffer state
between Russia and NATO. It should look like Austria during the Cold
War. Toward that end, the West should explicitly take European Union and
NATO expansion off the table, and emphasize that its goal is a
nonaligned Ukraine that does not threaten Russia. The United States and
its allies should also work with Mr. Putin to rescue Ukraine's economy,
a goal that is clearly in everyone's interest.

It is essential that Russia help end the fighting in eastern Ukraine and
that Kiev regain control over that region. Still, the provinces of
Donetsk and Luhansk should be given substantial autonomy, and protection
for Russian language rights should be a top priority.

Crimea, a casualty of the West's attempt to march NATO and the European
Union up to Russia's doorstep, is surely lost for good. It is time to
end that imprudent policy before more damage is done --- to Ukraine and
to relations between Russia and the West.

#### U.S.-Russian war causes extinction.

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [[even in an all-out
nuclear war between the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite
horrific casualties, [neither country's population is likely to be
completely destroyed **by the direct effects of the
blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The [aftermath could
be]{.mark} **much [worse]{.mark}**]{.underline}: the
[burning]{.underline} of [flammable materials [could send
massive]{.mark} amounts of [smoke into the
atmosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight and cause
sustained global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural disruption
-- **[[a nuclear winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

According to one model 9 , [an all-out exchange of 4,000
weapons]{.underline}10 [could lead to a drop in global temperatures of
around 8°C, making it **impossible to grow food for**]{.underline} 4 to
[**5 years**. This could leave some survivors]{.underline} in parts of
Australia and New Zealand, [but they would be in a very precarious
situation and the **threat of extinction from other sources would be
great**. An [exchange on this scale is]{.mark} **[only possible between
the US and Russia]{.mark}** who have more than 90% of the world's
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads
each, although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models
suggest that even [[a small regional nuclear war]{.mark} involving 100
nuclear weapons would]{.underline} produce a nuclear winter serious
enough to [put two billion]{.underline} people [at risk]{.underline} of
starvation,12 [though this]{.underline} estimate **[might be
pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale [are]{.mark}
**[unlikely to lead to]{.mark}**]{.underline} outright **[[human
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but this does suggest that conflicts
which are around an order of magnitude larger may be likely to threaten
civilisation. It should be emphasised that there is very large
uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global climate.
This remains an area where increased academic research work, including
more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of how
survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns.

[It is]{.underline} very [difficult to precisely estimate the
probability of **existential risk from nuclear war**]{.underline} over
the next century, and existing attempts leave very large confidence
intervals. According to many experts, [the most likely nuclear
war]{.underline} at present [is between India and
Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, [given the relatively modest size of
their arsenals]{.mark}, the [risk of human extinction is]{.mark}
**[plausibly greater]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} a [conflict between the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Tensions between these countries have
increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the
possibility of them rising further in the future.

#### **Russia won't expand beyond the Ukraine**

Russia's Vladimir [[Putin is ruthless when dealing with
adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} --- as when his navy shot up a
Ukrainian vessel seeking to enter the nearly enclosed Sea of Azov. The
facts appear to back Kiev, though no one should have any illusions about
Ukraine's governance. Moscow has become Washington's chief bête noire.
Yet [[America is]{.mark} vastly [more powerful]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, [the Russian Federation is]{.underline} not the Soviet Union
reborn. The former is [neither a global nor an ideological
competitor.]{.underline} Rather, much like a pre-1914 great power,
[[Moscow demands respect for its borders and interests]{.mark}.
[It]{.mark} certainly [**does not** want to wage a war with
America]{.mark}, which [it would lose]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Europe]{.mark} also is able to defend itself, possessing 10 times the
g]{.underline}ross [d]{.underline}omestic [p]{.underline}roduct [and
three times the population]{.underline}. The fact that Europeans do not
spend more --- Germany devotes a bit more than 1 percent of GDP to its
military --- demonstrates that [the continent really [doesn't fear
Moscow]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, stuck in a bad neighborhood,
[[Ukraine wants on to America's defense]{.underline}
[dole]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [[Washington]{.mark} already [is
**overburdened**, protecting]{.mark} prosperous and populous [Asian,
European and Middle Eastern allies]{.mark}. [Kiev isn't important for
U.S. security]{.mark}: Ukraine was part of both the Russian Empire and
the Soviet Union, without much effect]{.underline} on America. Ukraine
matters no more today. That sounds cold-hearted, but [alliances and wars
should be about security, not charity. Russia is determined to prevent
Ukraine from joining militarily with Moscow's adversaries.
[Nothing]{.mark}]{.underline} at stake in the Russia-Ukraine conflict
[[warrants the U.S. confronting a nuclear-armed
power]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### No broader Russian threat -- the Ukraine invasion is fundamentally defensive

**Lawrence 16**, Patrick Lawrence, Columnist, essayist, author and
lecturer, \"The Perils of Russophobia,\" The Nation, 12-29-2016,

park

**[[We are besieged]{.underline}]{.mark}**, readers. As the archives of
this magazine make perfectly plain, [[the spasm of Russophobia now
threatening]{.mark} to overcome us [is]{.mark}]{.underline} but [a
variant of the [anti-Soviet paranoia]{.mark}]{.underline} that defined
the 1950s and early 1960s. "[We're in the most dangerous confrontation
with Russia since the]{.underline} Cuban [missile crisis]{.underline},"
Stephen Cohen, the noted Russianist (and Nation contributor), said on
Amy Goodman's Democracy Now! earlier this month. T[his is just the
point---the reality we must now consider]{.underline} with utmost
seriousness. [[The ever-greater risk of open conflict between nuclear
powers]{.underline}]{.mark} that Cohen referred to [[is the most evident
danger confronting us]{.underline}]{.mark}, but there are others
requiring attention-paying people to bolt upright. Senator John McCain,
oozing that faux-gravitas he likes to affect, asserts that anyone
objecting to the anti-Russian orthodoxy is "lying," and he wants a
select committee to open hearings to investigate the CIA's recent
conclusion that Russia tampered with the US elections last month. The
corporate press, from the government-supervised New York Times on over,
now hastens to obscure the same shameful collaboration with power that
it displayed in the Cold War's depths. On a shocking website called
PropOrNot.com, Salem witch-hunters who refuse to identify themselves
list hundreds of media that they assert are manipulated by the Kremlin.
Read these, too, as danger signs. Anyone too young to remember the House
Un-American Activities Committee and Red Channels and all the
destruction they wrought ought to study up: We are a few short steps
away from both. [Russia is not destroying]{.underline} (what remains of)
[American democracy]{.underline}. "Patriotic Americans" are. It is
essential, as I suggest, to understand our moment in historical context.
Then each of us must decide, just as those called before the HUAC had
to: Do I acquiesce or participate in this freakish exercise in crowd
control and fear-mongering, or do I repudiate a propaganda campaign as
irrational and morally wrong as any concocted during the McCarthy years?
At last the question confronts us, and it is especially acute this time
for those self-described as progressives: Is one a descendant of that
muddled, gutless lot known as Cold War liberals, or does one insist on
clear sight and principle even in the face of the ideological blasts our
corporate media deliver daily? It is our minds that are the objects of
this onslaught: They are finally what is at issue. Think it through:
This is the imperative of our moment---a significant moment, because
[the [American propaganda]{.mark} machine [is now]{.mark} unusually
[challenged]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Its efficacy is no longer the
certainty]{.underline} it was during the Cold War decades. My own view,
to be clear straightaway, is without ambivalence. It is our minds that
are the objects of this onslaught: They are finally what is at issue.
Surrender yours to this most flagrant case of scapegoating---hatred and
anxiety conjured from thin air---and your place in the history books
will be with the ghosts of all the shrill Cold Warriors and cowering
chumps of decades past. \* \* \* "[[Russian aggression" has to go down
as one of the great, pernicious phrases of our
time]{.underline}---]{.mark}[requiring no further scrutiny whenever
deployed]{.underline}. The Russians invaded Ukraine and then stole
Crimea without prior provocation. Now they threaten to invade the Baltic
states. They cultivate extreme-right nationalists in Europe so as to
debilitate the European Union. The Russians are guilty of war crimes in
Syria. They have just invaded us, too, corrupting our democratic process
and throwing the 2016 election to Donald Trump and his houseful of
"Kremlin lackeys." [This is the stuff of our reigning
Russophobia]{.underline}. Let us try to identify what it is actually
made of. Every sentence in the above list has four attributes: (1) [[It
is]{.mark} broadly [accepted as fact]{.mark} just [as
written]{.mark};]{.underline} (2) [[there is little confirmed]{.mark},
published [evidence from impartial sources]{.mark}]{.underline}, if any,
[supporting it]{.underline}; (3) [it is either one or another form of
disinformation or misleads by way of omission]{.underline}---or both;
and (4) it is a source of delusion. And in the matter of the last it is
very weird. [Our policy cliques do well enough deluding Americans to the
effect that Russia now presents America with "an existential
threat"---]{.underline}a thought Pentagon and NATO brass are making
common currency, believe it or not---but they appear to think a nation
deluded by their incessant repetitions is somehow a fine and sturdy
thing. Deluded people do not generally do well, in my experience. Now,
one by one and briefly: [[Washington cultivated the]{.mark} February
2014 [coup in Ukraine, recklessly threatening Russia's only warm-water
port]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} on Crimea's Black Sea coast. [This
is airbrushed out of all US accounts]{.underline}, in the media and
elsewhere, but it is open-and-shut---a matter of record. So do we
cultivate our delusions. Parenthetically, [[have you heard any cries of
anguish]{.mark} and protest [from Crimeans since Russia annexed it? I
thought not]{.mark}]{.underline}. Half an hour with a good history text
will explain why. [[There is no evidence that Moscow intends to invade
any of the Baltic states]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Would Russia risk a war
with NATO? [The thought is **ridiculous**]{.mark}]{.underline}**.**
[[Its]{.mark} military [activities]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}
(all [within its borders]{.underline}) [[are
defensive]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[in response to NATO's
incessant]{.mark} manufacture of excuses to [advance
eastward]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a tiresome old Cold War trope:
[Aggress, and call it aggression when Russia responds
defensively]{.underline}, so creating space to continue aggressing.
Never forget the immortal pronouncement of John Kirby, the State
Department's current front man, in October 2014: Russia is on NATO's
doorstep, he sagely warned. Ask yourself: [[Why would Russia want to
weaken the E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion [when it benefits
from]{.mark} a dense economic [interdependence]{.mark}]{.underline} and
with [[which it wants to cooperate on]{.mark} a broad range of
questions---**including [Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}, I might add?
There have been Russian bank loans to Marine Le Pen's Front National; we
now have reports of some kind of agreement to do who knows what between
the governing United Russia party and Austria's extreme-right Freedom
Party. These are among a handful of contacts between nongovernmental
Russian political interests and rightist parties in Europe, but let us
take the Times's word for it this time: They are "murky," and they are
of little apparent consequence. (It is remarkable, I cannot resist
noting, how closely Moscow's alleged meddling in Europe resembles the
political meddling Washington has long allowed itself in Ukraine and
other such nations, as well as in Russia itself.) Assuming these
contacts have any significance at all, there is only one plausible
motive one can ascribe to Moscow: The European parties at issue oppose
the sanctions regime imposed after Russia's "out of the blue" annexation
of Crimea. The sanctions are damaging, and action begets reaction---a
truism Washington never seems to anticipate. There would be no surprise
here even if the allegations were to prove true as stated. We do not
have access to the truth of the Syrian war, other than its horror and
its very many casualties. We, too, are victims in this respect. I
therefore take the agnostic's stance, tilting neither one way nor
another. One pays attention, surmising what can be surmised, but knowing
one knows very little. I see no other defensible position. We are
constantly invited to believe, never to see or to think. It is important
to face this truth to avoid false conclusions and to refuse submission
to the propaganda machine. We have to wait for the truth, and it must
come from impartial sources. In this connection, Western NGOs such as
Médecins Sans Frontières do fine work, no doubt, but one must decline to
credit them as impartial; in some cases the Western tilt is perfectly
evident. Equally, "war crimes" is now far too thoroughly politicized as
a concept to accept without clean evidence, of which there is so far
none. Has Russia committed war crimes in Syria? One cannot answer either
way. Has the United States? It is the same. As this magazine demanded in
an editorial last week, let's see the evidence supporting all these
allegations of Russian interference in the American political process.
Robby Mook, who managed Hillary Clinton's campaign, asserted within a
couple of hours of the first e-mail leaks last summer that the Democrats
were certain it was the Russians---and certain, somehow, of their
motives. That bit of chicanery has ever since been my cue: I will
believe it when I see proof and emphatically not before. A few points
here: One, a number of highly qualified intelligence veterans, including
the estimable Ray McGovern, now say the e-mail caches at issue were
almost certainly leaked, not hacked---an inside job. This, too, deserves
more light, never mind you have read not one word of it in the corporate
media. Two, assume for a sec that Russia is indeed the responsible
party. Next to Washington's routinely vicious cyber-sabotage campaigns,
the exposed material stacks up as little more than a frivolous gossip
column. Three, there is the larger context---and the necessity here is
to bear it in mind. [Considering everything the United States has thrown
at Russia lately]{.underline}---a coup on its doorstep, a severe
sanctions regime, incessant saber-rattling in Washington, NATO's new
military presence within miles of Russia's borders---[one would have to
look upon an e-mail hack as a very restrained response]{.underline}.
Point 1 for all Russophobes, but especially the "progressive" variety:
There are costs attached to this swoon into perfect gullibility. It
leaves the door open to worsening what is already a dangerous level of
global tension, and chief among those served are the Pentagon, its NATO
subsidiary, military contractors, and Capitol Hill warmongers who act in
behalf of these three. Ask yourself, liberal: Is this where I line up?
[Suddenly you are willing to take the CIA's word for anything at
all?]{.underline} You accept what the Times publishes as true---and the
complete truth, nothing left out---because it is in the Times? Given the
historical record in both cases, this is very odd. So is the fact that
capital "D" Democrats are now leading the Russophobic charge. That used
to be the work of rightist reactionaries. One feels like Rip van Winkle,
awakening to find the world a different place. Most of all, the reigning
Russophobia worsens America's creeping isolation in world
affairs---evident for years but rarely mentioned among us, and so
another of our delusions. At bottom, [Washington still operates
according to Bush II's "with us or against us" construct, and the
world's vote starts to tilt toward the latter]{.underline}. In the end,
[the Russians will not be a lonelier people as a result of our efforts.
We will be.]{.underline} This swoon into gullibility leaves the door
open to worsening what is already a dangerous level of global tension.
There is no clearer case than Aleppo. In the Syria context, your mind is
the object of a propaganda campaign straight out of Edward Bernays, as
already suggested. Now our "moderates"---kindly democrats who shoot
fleeing civilians and bury them in mass graves, among much else---are
cleared from their east Aleppo stronghold, and what have we got? We have
Russia, Iran, and Turkey convening in Moscow, pointedly excluding the
United States while declaring themselves guarantors of a political
settlement in Syria. And we have the Obama administration's admirable
response: Nah, that'll never work. Now watch as we do our best to
obstruct it. We come to the consequential matter of lost opportunity.
[Russophobes can carry on about the evils of Russia and its leadership
all they like, but it comes, once again, at a cost]{.underline}. The
reality is that [[until Washington learns to cooperate with
Moscow]{.mark} on many, many issues of common interest, [solutions will
elude it; in]{.mark}]{.underline} notable
cases---[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, Syria---[[the cost is to be
measured in]{.mark} lost lives and [destroyed
societies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Obama administration has spent years
ever more pointedly diminishing Russia as no more than a regional power.
Let us at last mark this down as another delusion---this one among the
more destructive. Lesson No. 2 for Russophobes and all liberal
fellow-travelers: You assume certain responsibilities as you cast
Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} as Beelzebub. And as you do, you are the
fools of those addicted to great-power rivalry and the "indispensable
nation" narrative. For the record: Anyone capable of dispassionate
thinking---hello!? anybody home?---will recognize the Russian president
as a serious, effective statesman with an impressive grasp of history
and the forces shaping it. This does not require liking him, I should
add. He [has been proven right about a lot of things]{.underline}---one
reason, indeed, the policy cliques in Washington urge us all to detest
him. In my view, [Americans must consider the Russia question as one of
primary and secondary contradictions---greater and lesser
antagonisms]{.underline}. Russians, along with everyone else, have
numerous domestic problems, and for too many non-Russians these are
preoccupations. But [Russia's problems are for Russians to
resolve]{.underline}, as I have argued many times, and they are
secondary to that defining issue of our century, parity between West and
non-West. To understand Russia and its leadership in the above-sketched
frame is to come face to face with the odiousness of our Russophobic
majority and question why anyone going by the label "progressive" is
part of it. \* \* \* [Our current run of Russophobia is but the latest
chapter in a very old story]{.underline}. "There are now but two great
nations---the first is Russia, still barbarian but large, and worthy of
respect.... The other nation is America, an intoxicated, immature
democracy that knows no obstacles. The future of the world lies between
these two great nations. One day they will collide, and then we will see
struggles the like of which no one has dreamed of." Just my luck, I
think, whenever I reread that passage. It is Charles Augustin
Sainte-Beuve, the French historian and critic, writing, with exceptional
prescience, in 1847. It is among the earliest expressions of the
animosity now, just about 170 years later, playing out before us. Six
years after Sainte-Beuve wrote, a German thinker was the first to call
for a union of European nations against czarist Russia's rise. Then came
some heavyweights, among them Nietzsche and Jules Michelet, the
celebrated French historian (but who looked upon Russians as subhuman,
to his discredit). By the 1870s, the idea of "the West"---a
trans-Atlantic union now---was fully ascendant. It was, then, formed in
reaction---a defense from the first against "the Other" of the East.
This is the history we ought to know now. It is our history. During the
Cold War, [the long-brewing crisis between]{.underline} Sainte-Beuve's
["two great nations" reached the point when we were willing to
say]{.underline}, via our nuclear options, [that human life itself was
not as important as our triumph over the East as represented by the
Russians]{.underline}. Our current run of Russophobia is but the latest
chapter in the story. And now [our]{.underline} [obligations ought
to]{.underline} be plain. The first is to see clearly. It is to "go
beyond our past," as Nietzsche once put it. The second is to [[recognize
contention between West and non-West for what it is: A pointless
exercise rooted in]{.mark} the notion that [only one political and
social model will fulfill humanity's aspirations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The third is to refuse to take up and prolong this fruitless struggle.
It is to abandon it in the name of global diversity, a multiplicity of
preferences and forms. This is the 21st-century task, and the loud,
crude bout of Russophobia now threatening to envelop us is nothing but
resistance to it.

a new shipment of offensive weapons to the Ukrainian military, including

same as in Syria where extremist fighters got guns from U.S.-backed

fronts so they can circumvent the U.S. prohibitions]{.underline}**."

#### Recruitment, power & legitimacy allows Azov to export far right extremism globally

**Miller 18** ([Christopher
Miller](https://www.rferl.org/author/98603.html), correspondent based in
Kyiv who covers the former Soviet republics for Radio Free Europe,
NOVEMBER 14, 2018. Azov, Ukraine\'s Most Prominent Ultranationalist
Group, Sets Its Sights On U.S., Europe,
<https://www.rferl.org/a/azov-ukraine-s-most-prominent-ultranationalist-group-sets-its-sights-on-u-s-europe/29600564.html>

For the Ukrainians, too, the benefits extended outside the ring. **[It
marked a step toward legitimizing Azov among its counterparts in the
West and set in motion what appears to be its next project: the
expansion of its movement abroad. \"We think globally,\"]{.underline}**
Olena Semenyaka, the international secretary for Azov\'s political wing,
the National Corps, told RFE/RL in an interview at one of the group\'s
Kyiv offices last week. The Rundo fight has received fresh scrutiny
following an FBI criminal complaint against him unsealed last month that
preceded his arrest. In it, Special Agent Scott Bierwirth wrote that
Azov\'s military wing is \"believed to have participated in training and
radicalizing United States-based white supremacy organizations.\"
**[Washington has armed Ukraine with Javelin antitank missile systems
and trained its armed forces as they fight Russia-backed separatists in
the east.]{.underline}** But it has banned arms from going to Azov
members and forbidden them from participating in U.S.-led military
training because of their far-right ideology. It was Azov\'s Semenyaka
who hosted Rundo along with fellow Americans Michael Miselis and
Benjamin Daley, RAM members who participated in last year\'s \"Unite The
Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that was the backdrop for
the death of 32-year-old counterprotester Heather Heyer. This month, in
Kyiv, she hosted and translated for American Greg Johnson, a white
nationalist who edits the website Counter-Currents, which the Southern
Poverty Law Center describes as \"an epicenter of 'academic\' white
nationalism.\" Over the past year, she\'s made several outreach trips to
Western Europe to meet with far-right groups and spread Azov\'s
ultranationalist message. And when she\'s not doing it herself,
Semenyaka said, that task is sometimes given to Denis Nikitin, a
prominent Russian soccer hooligan and MMA fighter who founded the white
nationalist clothing label White Rex and has a garnered a large
following across Europe and the United States. In November 2017, the two
traveled together to Warsaw and participated in the Europe Of The Future
2 conference organized by Polish white supremacist group and \"ally\"
Szturmowcy (Stormtroopers), where they were meant to speak alongside
American Richard Spencer, Semenyaka said. But Polish authorities barred
Spencer from entering the country and he was unable to attend. Often in
Kyiv when he\'s not traveling through Europe or visiting family in
Germany, Nikitin operates as a sort of unofficial Azov
ambassador-at-large and organizes MMA bouts at the Reconquista Club, the
ultranationalist haunt where Rundo fought. A combination restaurant,
sports center, and fight club, Semenyaka said Rundo and Nikitin met
there and \"exchanged ideas.\" **[In the current climate, with an
apparent shift toward nationalism in parts of Europe, \"it\'s possible
for far-right leaders to come to power now and \-- we hope \-- form a
coalition]{.underline}**,\" Semenyaka told RFE/RL. And
**[Azov]{.underline}**, she added, \"**[wants a position at the front of
this movement]{.underline}**.\" From Battlefield To Political Arena The
Azov Battalion was formed in May 2014 in response to the Russia-backed
separatist advance sweeping across eastern Ukraine. Comprised of
volunteers, it has roots in a group of hard-core, far-right soccer fans,
including many violent hooligans, commonly known in Eastern Europe as
\"ultras.\" With Ukraine\'s weak military at the time caught
flat-footed, Azov and other such battalions did much of the heavy
fighting in the early days of the war, which has killed more than 10,300
people. But it was Azov that attracted those of far-right persuasion,
including at least three Americans and many others from Western nations.
One such fighter was Mikael Skillt, a Swede who trained as a sniper in
the Swedish Army and previously described himself as an \"ethnic
nationalist.\" The Azov Battalion flaunts a symbol similar to that of
the former Nazi Wolfsangel. (The group claims it is an amalgam of the
letters N and I for \"national idea.\") [It has been
accused](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/Ukraine_14th_HRMMU_Report.pdf)
by international human rights groups, such as the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), of committing and
allowing serious human rights abuses, including torture. Following a
2015 deal known as the Minsk Accords that was meant to be a road map to
end the fighting but did little more than turn down the intensity, the
Azov Battalion was officially incorporated into Ukraine\'s National
Guard and its leadership shifted focus from the battlefield to the
political arena. The Azov National Corps entered the political fray in
October 2016, appointing battalion commander Andriy Biletsky to lead it.
Biletsky was previously tied to other far-right groups and, in 2010,
[reportedly
said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/13/ukraine-far-right-national-militia-takes-law-into-own-hands-neo-nazi-links)
that the nation\'s mission was to \"lead the white races of the world in
a final crusade\...against Semite-led Untermenschen \[subhumans\].\" The
party incorporated two other far-right organizations, including Patriot
of Ukraine, which [according to the Kharkiv Human Rights
Group](http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1517275970) \"espoused xenophobic
and neo-Nazi ideas and was engaged in violent attacks against migrants,
foreign students in Kharkiv, and those opposing its views.\" [As RFE/RL
reported at the
time](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-nationalists-torchlight-march-azov-party/28053936.html),
the National Corps\' inaugural ceremony arguably had pomp more
reminiscent of 1930s Germany than of postwar democracy. It included
nationalist chants, raised fists, and a torchlit march through central
Kyiv. In January, in another flashy ceremony, Azov introduced a new
paramilitary force that it calls the National Militia. On a snowy
evening, some 600 of mostly young men in matching fatigues [marched from
Kyiv\'s central Independence
Square](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-azov-right-wing-militia-to-patrol-kyiv/29008036.html)
to a lighted fortress on a hillside in the Ukrainian capital, where they
swore an oath to clean the streets of illegal alcohol, drug traffickers,
and illegal gambling establishments. While not officially part of the
Ukrainian Interior Ministry or any other government body legally
authorized to enforce the law, the National Militia has more often than
not been allowed to establish what it considers \"Ukrainian order\" on
the streets of cities across the country. In many cases, that has meant
attacking LGBT events and Romany camps, actions for which members of the
group have not been prosecuted. Combined, these groups are known as the
\"Azov movement,\" which includes more than 10,000 active members,
according to Semenyaka. \'State Within The State\' But Azov\'s success
in growing the movement so far has not translated into much political
success at home. While the party has not yet been tested in
parliamentary elections, less than 1 percent of eligible voters said
they would vote for National Corps or its fellow far-right group Right
Sector, according to June polling by Kyiv-based Razumkov Center. Those
groups didn\'t fare much better in July, when GFK Ukraine asked whether
voters would support an alliance of National Corps, Right Sector, and a
third far-right party, Svoboda, and only 2 percent responded positively.
At the same time, however, **[Azov]{.underline}** believes its
**[influence has grown]{.underline}**. [In an October 29 post on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/olena.semenyaka/posts/2193069517369915?__tn__=H-R),
Semenyaka went so far as to say that \"just within 4 years, the Azov
Movement has become a small state in the state.\" **[Much of the success
has come from recruiting new]{.underline}**, mostly young, **[members,
who it hopes will come to the polls in next year\'s parliamentary
elections. [Azov has done so with youth
camps](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-azov-regiment-military/27355932.html)]{.underline}**,
including some that teach children as young as 9 years old military
tactics and far-right ideology, recreation centers, lecture halls, and
far-right education programs. It has also utilized the reach of social
media, particularly Facebook and Telegram, where the group recruits and
promotes patriotism, nationalism, and a sport-focused lifestyle. Much of
that effort caters to Ukrainians coming of age in a time of war and as
illiberal governments rise on the country\'s periphery, said Ukrainian
sociologist Anya Hrytsenko, who researches far-right groups. \"**[Azov
has made far-right nationalism fashionable]{.underline}**, and they have
been strategic in how they portray themselves, shedding the typical
neo-Nazi trappings,\" Hrytsenko told RFE/RL. \"**[This has helped them
to move from a subculture to the mainstream.\"]{.underline}** Explaining
that strategy, Semenyaka, who has been photographed holding a flag with
a swastika and making a Nazi salute, said that \"more radical\" language
was used previously, such as during the height of the war in 2014, when
the Azov Battalion needed fighters, \"because it was required by the
situation.\" Now, she said, **[the strategy is to \"moderate\" in order
to appeal to a broader base in Ukraine and abroad]{.underline}**. But
only to an extent. \"We are trying to become mainstream without
compromising some of our core ideas,\" she continued, adding that
\"radical statements\...scare away more of society.\" And in its
recalibration, **[Azov is not only thinking of Ukrainians but of
like-minded groups abroad]{.underline}**. Hence the addition of members
like Semenyaka and collaboration with Nikitin, who literally speak the
language of their counterparts abroad \"Their English has gotten
better,\" Hrytsenko said, referring to Azov members behind the group\'s
Western outreach. Nikitin, who could not be reached for an interview, is
a Russian and German speaker. Another thing that has helped, Hrytsenko
noted, is that Ukraine\'s break from Russia and move toward the European
Union has allowed Ukrainians visa-free travel, making Azov\'s outreach
easier logistically. Making Friends In The West In recent months,
Semenyaka and other Azov members have taken advantage of that, making
several visits to EU countries to meet numerous European counterparts,
according to investigations by RFE/RL and the open-source investigative
group Bellingcat. Semenyaka participated in and [blogged
about](http://intermariumnc.org/?p=425) the Young Europe Forum in
Dresden in August alongside far-right sympathizers from groups in
Germany, Italy, and Austria. Specifically, she said she has met with
those from groups that Azov considers close allies \-- for instance,
Greece\'s Golden Dawn, Italy\'s CasaPound, Poland's Szturmowcy, and
Germany\'s National Democratic Party and Alternative For Germany. Other
Azov members have traveled to meet counterparts in Baltic states and
Croatia, she added. Besides speaking about their shared ideologies,
Semenyaka said, **[Azov members in some cases have \"shared experiences
in creating territorial defense forces,\" a reference to the groups
battalion and vigilante street units.]{.underline}** Asked about the FBI
allegations in the [criminal
complaint](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/421-robert-rundo-complaint/0f1e76cdeef814133f24/optimized/full.pdf)
first reported by The New York Times \-- that **[Azov was \"training and
radicalizing\" American far-right groups]{.underline}** \-- she said it
was not and dared U.S. authorities to \"provide real evidence of this.\"
In the case of Rundo, Miselis, and Daley, Semenyaka said, \"they came to
learn our ways\" and \"showed interest in learning how to create youth
forces in the ways Azov has.\" On the visit, the three Americans also
attended a concert by the white-nationalist metal band Sokyra Peruna,
[where concertgoers made Nazi salutes and waved Nazi
flags](http://zaborona.com/interactive/sokyra-peruna-gig/). They also
posed for photographs to promote Rundo\'s The Right Brand clothing line
at Kyiv\'s Independence Square, [joined Azov members at Kyiv\'s famous
outdoor
gym](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8RiXlmzN6w&fbclid=IwAR1Q3SYdfgvuyjYjrJRu-ESLAvuxXWJDTrWRbvAepFYZf8STfAWah4u8c9w),
Kachalka, for a weight-training session, and fought at the Reconquista
Club. Rundo even got White Rex's Viking warrior logo tattooed on his
left calf. \"But there was no military training,\" Semenyaka insisted.
Counter-Currents\' Johnson was perhaps the most recent American to ask
for Azov\'s help. In a rare public appearance, the alt-right ideologue
visited Kyiv at the invitation of Semenyaka to lecture on October 16
about his Manifesto Of White Nationalism. Semenyaka translated for
Johnson, who spoke to a small but crowded room at Azov\'s Plomin (Flame)
cultural center. [In a video of the
event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRkbiezOOWs) published on Azov\'s
Plomin YouTube channel, Johnson, whom the Southern Poverty Law Center
(SPLC)
[describes](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/greg-johnson)
as \"one of the leading voices of the far-right\" and \"an international
figure for white nationalism,\" doesn\'t hide his motive for the trip:
to learn from Ukraine\'s ultranationalists and their successes. \"This
is not a speaking tour, it\'s a listening tour. I really want to learn
how maybe we can do things better in the United States and Western
Europe,\" Johnson said, lamenting the state of the alt-right in the
United States. \"**[It was a very, very influential and powerful
movement for a very short time]{.underline}**,\" he said of America\'s
alt-right movement, without providing a precise time frame. \"**[And at
the peak of it, we had a network that extended all the way to the office
of the president]{.underline}**,\" he continued, in what appeared to be
a reference to Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and
alt-right figure. \"There were very few degrees of separation between
people who were making ideas\...and people who were in a position to
make political policy, and that was totally destroyed,\" Johnson added.
He praised Ukraine\'s far-right groups, who he said were capable of
\"real street activism.\" Associations Too Much For Some In Azov While
Azov\'s cooperation with groups like RAM has been largely welcomed by
the group\'s members, some have found it uncomfortable. Skillt, the
Swedish national who fought as a sniper in the Azov Battalion, is one of
them. \"I don\'t mind \[Azov\] reaching out, but the ones they reach out
to\... Jesus,\" he told RFE/RL, in an allusion to RAM. He added that he
had recently distanced himself from Azov because of that association and
others with far-right groups in Europe. Skillt, who runs a private
intelligence agency in Kyiv and said his clients \"really don\'t enjoy
bad company,\" argued that the group has made a mistake by not reaching
out more to right-wing conservatives who could help with \"influential
contacts in Europe \[so\] you don\'t get branded a neo-Nazi.\" But
Semenyaka described praise of Azov from foreign ultranationalist groups
who are increasingly welcoming it as evidence that the organization is
taking the right path. And she said it isn\'t about to let up. Next, she
said, **[Azov hopes to win over larger, more mainstream far-right and
populist Western political forces who \"can be our potential
sympathizers.\"]{.underline}** \"If crises like Brexit and the refugee
problem continue, in this case, **[partnerships with nationalist groups
in Europe can be a kind of platform for our entry into the European
Union]{.underline}**.\"

#### Far right extremism causes a seismic shift toward European nationalism -- collapses the EU & NATO

<https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2019/04/15/an_assessment_of_the_threat_posed_by_increased_nationalist_movements_in_europe_114333.html>

**[In recent years there has been a groundswell of nationalism and
far-right extremism across Europe, allowing far-right political parties
to gain power]{.underline}** in several countries as well as
representation in the European Parliament. Today there are more than 59
nationalist parties, 15 regionalist parties, more than 60 active
nationalist-separatist movements, and a growing radical right-wing
extremist movements throughout the EU. Collectively, far-right
nationalist groups occupy 153 of 751 seats in the European Parliament
representing 21 of the 28 EU member states. This rise in nationalist
sentiment is the result of growing Euroscepticism that has been driven
in part by the Eurozone debt crisis, increased opposition to mass
immigration, fear of cultural liberalization, and the perceived
surrender of national sovereignty to external organizations. **[These
nationalist movements threaten the integrity of the EU, the future of
the NATO Alliance, and the overall security and stability of
Europe.]{.underline}** Leveraging nationalist sentiments, Russia is
waging a hybrid warfare campaign to achieve their own political
objectives by supporting nationalist opposition parties and far-right
extremist groups to increase Euroscepticism and ultimately create
disengagement among EU and NATO members. Today's **[nationalist
movements are gaining strength in part because they are creating large
networks of support across Europe. These movements have created
transnational alliances to support each other to oppose the
EU]{.underline}**. The Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), Europe of
Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD or EFD2), and the European
Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) are nationalist Eurosceptic groups
made up of members from several EU members states that collectively have
significant representation in the European parliament. These group's
stated purpose is to work for freedom and co-operation among peoples of
different States to return power back to the people of sovereign states,
to focus on respect for Europe's history, traditions and cultural values
with the belief that peoples and Nations of Europe have the right to
protect their borders and strengthen their own historical, traditional,
religious and cultural values\[1\]. These groups are also committed to
sovereignty, democracy, freedom and ending mass immigration so that
members may advance their own interests at the domestic level\[2\].
**[The collective strength of these groups empower local nationalist
movements, enabling them to gain influence and power that might not
otherwise be possible]{.underline}**. As each individual nationalist
movement gains power, the larger alliance gains power to support other
movements. The rise of nationalist sentiments is also emboldening
right-wing extremism groups. While not all nationalist parties are
affiliated with right-wing extremism, the similarity in ideologies
creates sympathetic leanings that are destructive for society. In recent
years**[, right-wing political movements have brought together
coalitions of Neo-Nazis with mainstream free-market conservatives,
normalizing political ideologies]{.underline}**\[3\]. **[These
relationships can be used to serve mutually supportive
positions]{.underline}** while leaving room for plausible deniability.
These violent **[far-right groups have not only embraced similar
populist language of the nationalist political movements, they also
espouse openly racist epithets and employ violence to pursue their goals
of reestablishing ethnically homogenous states]{.underline}**\[4\]. Not
unlike the Nazi party of the past and consistent with nationalist
rhetoric, these groups portray immigrants and ethnic minorities as the
cause for economic troubles and demonize as threats to the broader
national identity\[5\]. In essence, **[nationalist parties benefit from
national fervor generated by these right-wing extremist without having
to openly support their violent activities]{.underline}**.

#### EU collapse causes extinction

**Markley 16** (Stephen Markley, "Is France the Final Domino for the
European Union?," 12-15-16,
<https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/12/is-france-the-final-domino-for-the-european-union.html>)

If 2016 has taught us anything, it's to pay heed to previously
outlandish possibilities because those possibilities are itching to
stand and be counted. One such outcome, which now seems frighteningly
close to reality, is [**the sudden collapse of** the European
Union.]{.underline} Following the United Kingdom's exit from **[the
EU]{.underline}** and the election of Donald Trump in the United States,
it's clear the rising tide of nationalism, anti-globalism, and sheer
discontent is actually a rather monstrous wave which may yet prove to be
a tsunami. All eyes have landed **[on]{.underline}** [the French
presidential election]{.underline} where the hard-right Francois Fillon
clinched the Republican party nomination, while the perennial challenge
from the National Front's even-further-right-wing Marine [**Le Pen**
remains a]{.underline} Francophile [Black Swan]{.underline}. Le Pen and
the National Front have long dabbled on the borders of outright racism,
and let's just say her kindler, gentler platform includes immigration
controls, a fight against Islamism, a rebuff of "savage globalization,"
and a promise for a referendum on EU membership should she win. Sound
familiar? Forces of moderation have long kept Le Pen's father and
political predecessor Jean-Marie Le Pen and the National Front at bay.
Because France requires presidential candidates to win an outright
majority in a run-off and there's no version of the Electoral College to
throw the race to a candidate for whom the majority of people have not
voted, [Le Pen is still seen as a long shot by most conventional
analysts, but in the current climate all bets are off]{.underline}. Even
if Fillon wins, it's not unreasonable to think that he'll face pressure
from his right flank to hold an EU referendum, a la David Cameron. Even
prominent figures on the French left like former economy minister Arnaud
Montebourg and candidate of the left-wing Parti de Gauche have described
their displeasure with the EU's economic prescriptions. This ennui could
leach into non-National Front voters. A "**[Frexit]{.underline}**"
within the next two to three years **[is a very real
possibility]{.underline}**. [Without France, the Eurozone would be down
to Germany and a host of economically weaker satellite
countries]{.underline}. How long would German voters go on supporting
this crumbling edifice? The over-under begins on the date of the next
German election. Meanwhile in Italy, the defeat of a constitutional
referendum has thrown the government into a tailspin and marked the rise
of Beppo Grille and the Five Star Movement. Grille, an entertainer who
came to fame on Italian TV in the 1970s and 80s has "capitalized on his
showbiz bravado" to spearhead Italy's eurosceptic movement (again, see
anything recognizable?). His party and the far-right Northern League,
which still aligns itself with fascist leader Benito Mussolini, are seen
as likely to make gains when the next general election is held. In many
ways this crisis is one of the EU and member states' own making. It
pursued a continent-wide program of austerity following one of the
greatest financial crises since the Great Depression. While the United
States fought the 2008 downturn with a counter-cyclical Keynesian
package (and still ended up with a backlash and austerity), many
European governments (especially the UK) as well as the European
Commission and European Central Bank pursued deficit reduction, cutbacks
to social services, and tax increases, creating enmity towards Brussels
on both sides of the political spectrum. Austerity was a total disaster.
The migrant crisis and terrorist attacks in France have taken their
tolls as well. [This momentum has a danger in and of
itself.]{.underline} It would be one thing if the 28 EU member nations
spent five to ten years carefully negotiating a series of decisions that
would lead to the dissolution of the project of post-war European
integration, a dissolve in which everyone carefully considered the
outcomes this would have on trade, mutual defense, currency, migration,
travel, regulation, and every other sector of European society. However,
[what is becoming clear is that **if and when the crack-up occurs it
will be abrupt**, **startling**, **and no one will have
control**]{.underline} over the results, let alone any idea about the
unintended consequences that lie ahead. It's important to stress that
one not need be a defender of the EU's every practice or claim that its
foundation did not contain follies (for instance a single currency
without true political union and uniform monetary policies) to fear the
implications of its sudden collapse. There's a strain of thinking that
goes, "Well, the EU is run by unelected neoliberal elites jamming
economic liberalization down the throats of member nations. Let it
burn." But this attitude ignores a rather glaring problem: [no one knows
what the hell would happen in the event of an EU collapse]{.underline}.
When I say no one, I don't just mean the average British, French,
German, Italian, Irish, or Latvian voter. I mean no economist, no
politician, no banker, no one in Brussels, London, Paris, or Berlin has
any clue what **[the consequences of a "Eurexit]{.underline}**" might
be. Suffice it to say, a best-case scenario **[makes]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** uncertainty surrounding the
2007-20**[08]{.underline}** **[financial crisis look like a common
cold.]{.underline}** At least in that case, the ruling elite at least
understood what it could do to prevent a panic and **[subsequent global
depression]{.underline}**. Take the example of the French. If France
were to leave the safety of the German economy, it **[would
land]{.underline}** on its own with a highly devalued Franc and a
national debt that equals 96% of the country's GDP. Even France,
however, is in far better shape than the smaller economies of the
Eurozone. Former Prime Minister of Ireland, John Bruton, penned an op-ed
in 2015 during the height of the Greek mess and in anticipation of the
coming Brexit vote, which outlined some of [the more dangerous
possibilities of **a Eurozone collapse**]{.underline}. It's worth
quoting at length: New currencies would have to be established. The
relative value of these currencies would be unknown and unknowable. Some
would lose value very quickly and others would shoot up in value.
[Exports would become dramatically uncompetitive in some
cases]{.underline}, and in others they would become so cheap that there
would be accusations of dumping, currency manipulation, and calls for
immediate reintroduction of import duties to level the playing field...
In some countries **[the banking system would break down]{.underline}**,
and people would have no access to credit for even the most basic
transactions. In others, people would cease to trust the value of their
own money, and money, after all, is based on a promise and if people can
no longer trust the states standing behind the promise, the basis for
money is gone. As Bruton points out, this has happened before. Following
the break-up of the Soviet Union, the rouble zone collapsed in the
1990s, halving incomes in both exporter nations like Russia and importer
countries like Estonia. Everyone suffered, no one was spared. Yes,
smaller countries would find themselves suffering particularly hard, but
the **[economic chaos would spread]{.underline}** to the sturdier
economies and almost certainly leak **[outside of Europe's
borders]{.underline}**. Nationalists currently point to Brexit and say,
"See? The sky hasn't fallen! Stop the fear-mongering" even as Brexit
continues along as a slow-rolling disaster. Theresa May and the British
political class seem to have laughably little clue or control, as
complex issues gather like slag at their feet. Take the headache the
country will have over low-skilled workers. As an aging population
increasingly needs elderly care, the UK will have no choice but to allow
in the same low-skill, low-wage foreign workers that so enraged Brexit
voters in the first place. It can either allow this immigration or face
a crisis with its senior care. Or take the example of [major banks
already eyeing the door and the likely possibility that London will no
longer be Europe's main financial center]{.underline}. Or the fact that
Europe accounts for roughly half of the UK's exports, and in order to
maintain that lifeblood of trade, its leaders will almost certainly have
to join the European Economic Area (enjoyed by such countries as Iceland
and Norway). In other words, it will have to agree to all the laws
relevant to the European single market and contribute to the budget of
the European Union but without having any vote, voice, or say in EU
decisions. The UK's economy will continue to flounder, slip once again
into recession, and the forces of nationalism will likely gain from it
as they bludgeon citizens with the same insipid propaganda that led to
the Brexit vote. This is why during the past eight years of muddling
through the Greek crisis, some European leaders kept saying the only way
forward is through increased European integration and democratic
governance. Bruton suggests one key reform necessary to creating a sense
of European identity, which would be to hold European-wide elections for
its president. Rather than having 27 different elections in 27 discreet
countries, the institution should have EU-wide party lists and an
EU-wide vote for the presidents of the European Union Commission and
Council (currently, these are selected in closed-door meetings by the
heads of government). Such reforms are not complicated, especially given
the alternative of an EU break-up. For many Americans reading this,
there is no doubt a sense of remove from the relevance of the European
project. Think of it this way: [**for centuries Europe was the Middle
East of the world**. It was a **war-hungry**, dysfunctional,
**violent**, **chaotic piece of the globe** that could barely go a
decade without a barbaric,]{.underline} usually [pointless blood-letting
conflict]{.underline}. Since World War II and the economic and political
integration that brought former nation-state rivals into mutually
beneficial coexistence, the continent has been a region of remarkable
prosperity and stability. Keep in mind, this has never happened before
in human history: a set of political leaders and their constituents
voluntarily chose to cede elements of sovereignty in order to form a
better, stronger union. The United States and Great Britain, often
mentioned as democratic ideals, were two empires won by violent conquest
in which wealthy elites only begrudgingly allowed democracy to sift down
to the most impoverished and brutalized citizens. The parochial
movements of the last five to ten years---from the EU's troubles to the
Scottish independence vote to the surge of American nationalism that
brought us such phenomenon as the go-it-alone war in Iraq and now Donald
Trump---have different roots and causes but they do share a common
thread. We live in an increasingly complex and interdependent world
where **[the greatest threats to peace]{.underline}**, individual
well-being, and human flourishing **[are]{.underline}** largely
**[transnational]{.underline}**. **[Climate change]{.underline}**,
infectious **[disease]{.underline}**, nuclear
**[proliferation]{.underline}**, **[financial crisis]{.underline}**,
**[cyber]{.underline}** insecurity---these are all borderless phenomenon
that do not care if their victims are French, British, American, or
Syrian. Their worst consequences do not care about our flags, languages,
religions, or skin colors. And yet at a time when **[transnational
peril]{.underline}** **[necessitates a greater need for
cooperation]{.underline}**, tolerance, **[and unity]{.underline}**,
Western liberal democracies are taking **[a hard turn into
fragmentation]{.underline}**, arrogance, self-pity, and denial. **[The
break-up of the]{.underline}** **[E]{.underline}**uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion brought on by a wave of selfish,
quasi-authoritarian nationalism **[would be a staggering blow to the
economic and political security of]{.underline}** what remains of
**[the]{.underline}** increasingly precarious free
**[world]{.underline}**.

#### NATO is [key]{.underline}\-\--it's a [full-spectrum]{.underline} force multiplier and [guarantees]{.underline} multilateral logistics 

**Weinrod 16** - Former Secretary of Defense Representative Europe and
Defense Advisor to the U.S. Mission NATO (W Bruce, "We Still Need NATO,"
The American Interest,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/01/15/we-still-need-nato/)

[Not only does [NATO]{.mark} remain relevant, but more importantly it
[continues to support]{.mark} and advance [U.S. security]{.mark}
interests]{.underline}---though again, often in ways that do not make
headlines and that casual observers rarely appreciate in full. Most
fundamentally, [[NATO provides]{.mark} a standing [multilateral military
capability]{.mark} [that can]{.mark} **[deter or be deployed]{.mark}**
should a significant security threat arise]{.underline}. Because NATO
has a military capability in place, the core elements for mobilization,
deployment, and sustainment of substantial multilateral military forces
already exist. The [[ongoing training]{.mark}, exercises, [and]{.mark}
regular [communication]{.mark} among the national militaries of NATO
members [allows]{.mark} them to **[jump-start]{.mark}** preparations and
[actions]{.mark} when needed **[without]{.mark}** very [lengthy
prep]{.mark}aratory work]{.underline}. [[This can]{.mark} [allow the
U.S.]{.mark} government [to]{.mark} proceed in [shap]{.mark}ing [and
lead]{.mark}ing [military coalitions]{.mark} more [quickly, at less
cost]{.mark} and [with greater effectiveness]{.mark}, than if NATO did
not exist and its functional equivalent had to be invented from scratch
at a moment's not]{.underline}ice. While the U.S. government retains the
capacity and the right to act unilaterally if and when necessary, it
makes sense for it to act with others whenever possible, whether through
NATO or ad hoc coalitions of the willing. [A multilateral framework can
provide both political cover and military resources, and the United
States very much can benefit from both]{.underline}. [The United States
also benefits significantly from NATO's **logistics**
capabilities]{.underline}. Pontificating about grand strategies sounds
impressive, but for military effectiveness and success, [logistics
capabilities are what really count]{.underline}. [For example, while
NATO did not formally participate in the 1991 Gulf War, [NATO resources,
supplies, bases, and]{.mark} other [infrastructure]{.mark}
[provided]{.mark} crucial [support]{.mark} prior to and [during]{.mark}
the U.S.-led coalition military action to force Saddam Hussein out of
[Kuwait]{.mark}.]{.underline} The coalition in effect borrowed NATO
capacities already in existence, and benefitted greatly from equipment
compatibility and common training and resources. [[Other coalitions
of]{.mark} the willing assembled under U.S auspices and utilizing NATO
resources can follow the same approach]{.underline}. In addition, [[the
U.S.]{.mark} government [has access to]{.mark} the [numerous]{.mark}
military [facilities and resources that member nations make available to
NATO]{.mark}. A good example is Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, now being
used against ISIS in what is not a formal NATO operation]{.underline}.
As importantly, [[working through NATO]{.mark} usually [makes it]{.mark}
relatively [**routine** for host governments to **agree** to]{.mark}
[U.S. requests]{.mark} to use facilities within their territory for
military-related purposes]{.underline}. [Without NATO,]{.underline} in
order to fulfill its security responsibilities, the U.S. government
would need to develop and maintain a complex network of bilateral and
multilateral security agreements and arrangements that would seek to
maintain the kind of connectivity and flexibility that NATO already
provides. Further, [the U.S. government would need not only agreements
to access such military facilities but also would likely need to obtain
specific approval from the host nation for each use and perhaps even in
some cases legislative approval]{.underline}. In general, [[it
is]{.mark} much simpler, [faster]{.mark}, [and **easier
politically**]{.mark} and otherwise for nations [to grant the]{.mark}
United [States]{.mark} the use of their [facilities within]{.mark} a
[NATO]{.mark} framework than it would be to have to grant permission to
the United States on their own]{.underline}. Over recent decades
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} has, as noted above,
[[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[global
security]{.underline}]{.mark} network that reflects formalized
relationships with non-NATO nations. For the United States, this brings
the advantage that it can work through NATO to develop or enhance
security relationships with states that belong to the PFP, the MD, the
ICI, and NATO bilateral security relationships. [Working through NATO
provides an extra dimension to U.S. efforts to enhance the military
capacities of friends and allies in various regions who, with training
and assistance, can provide supplementary support to NATO or U.S.-led
operations. [NATO also supports]{.mark} U.S. interests by providing a
multilateral framework for a U.S. [presence]{.mark} in nations
[where]{.mark} [the U.S.]{.mark} government [wishes to]{.mark} help
[train]{.mark} and also enhance its military [contacts]{.mark}, but
where unilateral U.S. military involvement might be politically
contentious]{.underline}.

[The liberal world order is **under assault**]{.underline}. Polls
suggest an American ambivalence about upholding the rules-based global
system. Populists are besieging governing elites in the West while
Russia works strategically to destabilize European and American
governments through propaganda and proxies. [A rising China wants to
create a global system that is not U.S.-centric]{.underline}, one [in
which]{.underline} [smaller powers defer to bigger ones]{.underline} and
norms of democracy and rule of law do not prevail. Meanwhile, the U.S.
alliance system looks adrift while competitors in China and Russia
appear to be on the march. If it holds, [this trend could produce a
**[spheres-of-influence
world]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [which]{.underline} many, including the
current presidents of the United States, [China]{.underline}, [and
Russia]{.underline}, [find **intuitively attractive**]{.underline}. But
were such an order to replace one based on global integration and
American leadership in the geopolitical cockpits of Europe and Asia, [it
[would]{.mark} only [engender]{.mark} **[insecurity]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In a
spheres-of-influence world]{.underline}, [great powers order their
regions]{.underline}. The United States would go back to a "Monroe
Doctrine" version of grand strategy; [[Russia would
dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[former Soviet
space]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[China would govern East
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and India South Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The problem with this kind of order, however, is several-fold. Too many
[**[spheres overlap]{.underline}** [in ways that]{.underline}]{.mark}
[would **[generate conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [rather than clean
lines of responsibility]{.underline}. [[Japan would oppose Chinese
suzerainty in East Asia]{.mark}, including [by]{.mark} **[developing
nuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[India and China]{.mark} would
**[compete vigorously]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in Southeast
Asia]{.underline}; [[Russia and China]{.mark} would **[contest the
resources]{.mark}** and loyalties [of Central Asia]{.mark}]{.underline};
[[Europe and Russia]{.mark} would [clash]{.mark} over primacy of Central
and Eastern Europe]{.underline}. [[The Middle East would be]{.mark} an
even [more likely]{.mark} arena [for **hot war** between Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia [and Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and [Turkey would contest
regions]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[claimed by
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} possibly [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Russia]{.underline}, like the Soviet Empire before it, [would keep
pushing west until it met enough hard power to stop it]{.underline}. [A
[spheres of influence world]{.mark}]{.underline} would also **[[sharpen
great power competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** [outside of each
region]{.underline}. [[Regional hegemony is a **springboard** for global
contestation]{.underline}]{.mark}. [China would be more likely to
challenge the United States out-of-area if it had subdued **strategic
competition**]{.underline} in its own region. [Russia]{.underline}, like
the Soviet Empire before it, [would keep pushing west until it met
enough hard power to stop it]{.underline}. (The fact that Russian troops
marched through Paris during the Napoleonic Wars demonstrates that the
limits of Russian power need not be confined to the former Warsaw Pact).
American leaders have long understood that a "Fortress America" approach
is a source of national insecurity. Franklin Roosevelt made this case in
a series of "fireside chats" in the run-up to America's participation in
World War II --- even before the advent of the far more sophisticated
power-projection technologies that exist today. Roosevelt and his
generals well understood that the United States could not be safe if
hostile powers controlled Europe and Asia, despite the wide oceans
separating North America from both theaters. A [[spheres-of-influence
world would]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[crack
up]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[the integrated global
economy]{.underline}]{.mark} that underlies the miracle in human welfare
that has lifted billions out of poverty in past decades. [[It would
replicate]{.mark} the **[exclusive economic blocs]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of the 1930s]{.underline}, [including an East Asia]{.underline}
"co-prosperity sphere," [seeding conflict and undercutting
prosperity]{.underline}. A real-world and real-time example of what
happens when American power retreats in an effort to encourage regional
powers to solve their own problems is the mess in Syria. It has produced
the greatest refugee crisis since 1945 --- a stain on the consciousness
of human civilization --- and has led many to conclude that the Middle
Eastern order of states dating to the end of World War 1 is collapsing.
President Obama pursued an express policy of retracting American
military power from the Middle East, including withdrawing all troops
from Iraq and refusing to intervene militarily when President Assad used
chemical weapons against his own people, despite a red-line injunction
from the United States not to do so. Obama and his White House political
advisors believed that American withdrawal from the Arab Middle East (if
not from the ironclad U.S. commitment to Israel) would lead a new
balance of power to form, one policed by regional powers rather than by
America. [[This flawed]{.underline}]{.mark}, amoral, and [un-strategic
[approach]{.mark} has [led to a series of **hot
wars**]{.mark}** **]{.underline}--- in [[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline}
[[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the [[collapse of Arab allies'
confidence]{.mark} in the United States as an ally]{.underline}, [as
well as]{.underline} an [**intensified [cold war]{.mark}** [with
Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Despite the international
agreement]{.underline} freezing Iran's nuclear program, [Iran's support
for terrorism and hostile insurgencies targeting American allies across
its region actually **intensified** during this period]{.underline}. A
[[spheres-of-influence]{.underline}]{.mark} world [[leaves weaker states
to become]{.mark} the [victims of stronger]{.mark}]{.underline} or more
[[aggressive ones]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[it seeds]{.mark}
**[insecurity]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}]{.underline} [[removing]{.mark} the
reassuring variable of American [military guarantees]{.mark} and
presence]{.underline} This experience underlines a core problem with a
[[spheres-of-influence]{.underline}]{.mark} world. It leaves weaker
states to become the victims of stronger or more aggressive ones, and it
seeds insecurity by removing the reassuring variable of American
military guarantees and presence. [It **[emboldens]{.mark} American
[adversaries]{.mark}** [and leads]{.mark} American [allies to take
self-help measures]{.mark} that themselves may **undercut** American
security interests]{.underline}. A [spheres-of-influence
world]{.underline} would also [produce contestation of the open global
commons]{.underline} [that are the basis for the **unprecedented
prosperity**]{.underline} produced by the liberal international economic
order. [[Should the Indian and Pacific Oceans]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
the [[Arctic and Mediterranean Seas]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[become
arenas of great-power conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} (like the South
China Sea already has thanks to China's militarization and unilateral
assertion of sovereignty over it) [as leading states seek to incorporate
them into their privileged zones of control]{.underline}, [[economic
globalization would **collapse**]{.mark}, [harming]{.mark} the
[economies of every major power]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The United

\*CBRN = Chemical, biological, radiological & nuclear weapons

Even though only limited information was available on the ideological
motivation and background of individuals involved in far-right CBRN
terrorism, **[a strong indication emerged from the
dataset]{.underline}** that **[non-religious forms of far-right
ideology]{.underline}**, **[especially neoNazism and]{.underline}**
non-religious **[white supremacism, were the main driving forces behind
the incidents]{.underline}** (58 percent or 18 incidents of the
dataset). Hence, **[it was]{.underline}** not the notion of an
"apocalyptic racism" 59 that appears to have been an important goal of
far-right CBRN incidents, but rather **[the attempt to create chaos and
cause an uprising to topple the government; to force the authorities to
declare martial law causing public unrest and helping far-right groups
to take power]{.underline}**; to directly weaken law enforcement and the
government; or to destroy identified enemies. Widely held assumptions
that the risk of political blowback for non-religious terrorists when
associated with CBRN terrorism would act as a rational barrier against
these tactics have not been confirmed in the case of far-right CBRN
terrorism. This strongly supports studies arguing that **[the strategic
or pragmatic logic behind the choice of weapon outweighs potential
ideological repercussions]{.underline}**.60 This finding is furthermore
supported by the clear majority (also 61 percent or 19 cases) of
incidents which involve an attack or weapon design **[indiscriminately
attacking prospective victims]{.underline}**. This includes **[poisoning
the water supply]{.underline}** of large cities, **[detonating a "dirty
bomb]{.underline}**," **[or]{.underline}** pumping **[poisonous
gas]{.underline}** into ventilation systems of certain buildings. Even
though in some cases the target group was delineated (e.g., Jewish
community), the attack would not have made it possible to discriminate
between individuals or even small groups of people. Successful plans
would have resulted in indiscriminate casualties in the majority of
cases. It is unknown whether the perpetrators saw a risk of political
blowback, and a potential indication---the use of claiming and
communication after the successful attack---is not available for most of
the incidents, since they failed to come to fruition. It is known that
right-wing terrorists rarely claim their attacks,61 and **[a popular
strategy within the far-right calls for false flag
attacks]{.underline}** (the "strategy of tension") 62 **[to cause
populations to rally behind right-wing extremist parties and movements
for restoring law and order]{.underline}**. Without assessing the
communication behavior of perpetrators after an attack, we cannot be
sure what the communication strategy of far-right CBRN actors might have
been. Nevertheless, the fact that most attack plans were designed to
target indiscriminately indicates that the persons involved either saw
no ideological issue with that tactic or did not anticipate a
significant negative backlash on their own group or movement. On the
agents and complexity of plots Multiple different agents of chemical,
biological, or radiological origin were identified in the 31 incidents
of the dataset for this article. However, for some incidents conflicting
agents were listed in the analyzed sources, leaving only a vague idea of
the agents intended for use. Nevertheless, the majority of incidents (11
out of 31) involved ricin, followed by cyanide compounds (8 out of 31).
Both agents require only a low level of knowledge and equipment for
their acquisition and can thus be rated as agents of low complexity.
Cyanide compounds, such as sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide, are
required for a variety of chemical synthesis reactions and can therefore
be easily obtained.63 They are also ready for harmful application
"out-of-the-box." In contrast to these chemical compounds, ricin is a
toxic protein of biological origin. Ricin can be isolated from the beans
of the castor oil plant (Ricinus communis) using a small laboratory
setup in a plain household kitchen with makeshift extraction
equipment.64 The beans of the castor oil plant as well as the isolation
manuals can be acquired via the internet. However, due to the mixed
quality of source material and equipment used, the quality and purity of
ricin isolated within a makeshift laboratory setup might be
significantly low. Ricin must be taken up into the human body, e.g., by
injection, oral application, or inhalation, to exert high-level
toxicity.65 Since the production of ricin is laborious, it is unlikely
that sufficient quantities can be easily obtained to affect large
crowds, e.g., by aerosolization.66 Ricin is most likely to be used for
targeted assassinations, e.g., of governmental personnel, or an attack
on a confined space, such as a restaurant, e.g., by lacing bowls filled
with food or sauces with ricin. Ricin is also the most prominent agent
of biological origin identified in the incidents. Further toxins that
are generally considered as potential agents in bioterror attacks, such
as shigatoxin or staphylococcal enterotoxin,67were not identified in any
incident. However, these agents are also more difficult to acquire,
since they must be isolated and purified from bacterial cultures, while
ricin can be isolated in a simpler way from plain raw materials. Other
biological agents (such as botulinum toxin) were included in only a few
incidents. Additionally, bacterial strains were only considered as an
active agent in a handful of incidents (5 out of 31). Anthrax, which has
become synonymous with the spores of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis
and the toxin produced by the bacteria,68 was only identified in three
incidents. Anthrax is generally considered by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) to be the agent most likely to be used in a large-scale
terror attack on the United States.69 It is therefore surprising that
the incident numbers are low, since anthrax would be advantageous for
several reasons. B. anthracisis an omnipresent soil dweller and can thus
be obtained from environmental samples by microbiological isolation
procedures.70 Also, while growing B. anthracis in a makeshift laboratory
setup is a hurdle for the unskilled person, any individual with
microbiological training would potentially be able to set up an
improvised production line for the manufacturing of a low- to
medium-quality slurry of spores, infectious enough for application in a
terror plot. Bacteria in general are more suitable for targeting large
crowds, due to the spreading of spores and the contagious nature of most
microbes. Additionally, secondary infections spreading from the primary
victims would potentially broaden the impact of the attack, putting the
public in danger and constituting a challenge to containment policy.
However, this scenario is unlikely in the case of anthrax, since B.
anthracis is not spread by person-to-person transmission. Viruses were
not considered in any of the identified cases. While viral diseases,
such as Lassa or Ebola, often result in high mortality rates, their
confined appearance in countries of, e.g., West Africa, pose high
hurdles for their acquisition. Additionally, culturing and propagation
is dependent on eukaryotic host cells, which require sophisticated
bioreactors, unlikely to be found outside of the pharmaceutical or
biotechnological industry. High demands on sterile working and culturing
conditions, to avoid contamination of the culture broth or for
self-protection against the agent, further complicate the use of
viruses. Sophisticated agents of chemical warfare, such as mustard,
sarin, and VX, were only identified in one incident. These agents are
highly effective in targeting large groups of humans and have a long
history of application in warfare because of their high toxicity, the
ease of dispersal due to their volatile nature, and their frightening
characteristics.71 However, they are also difficult for individuals or
small groups to acquire or produce in a self-developed setup. This is
especially visible in the case of Demetrius Crocker, the only
far-right-aligned terrorist who tried to acquire a sophisticated agent
of chemical warfare, the organophosphorus compound "sarin." Crocker did
not intend to manufacture the nerve agent himself, but attempted to buy
it from a potential supplier who was in fact a federal undercover
agent.72 The synthesis of sophisticated agents of chemical warfare not
only requires chemical components of high purity and in-depth knowledge
of the synthesis process, but also places high demands on the safety and
sophistication of the manufacturing equipment, location, and storage.73
These requirements are unlikely to be met by individuals or small groups
with no access to industrial or academic laboratories. This complicated
procedure has so far only been accomplished by the highly organized Aum
Shinrikyo cult, resulting in the 1995 sarin attack on the Tokyo subway,
and the ISIL terrorist semi-state. More easily accessible are toxic
industrial materials of the chemical industry, such as sulfur dioxide,
hydrofluoric acid, or chlorine, which are transported in hazardous goods
transports on road and railways. Chlorine, which reacts strongly with
the water on the human mucosa and thus potentially results in airway
injury ("dry-land drowning"),74 might be the chemical agent which can be
acquired most easily by terrorists. Chlorine can be obtained from a
variety of shops or, in even larger scale, from a wide variety of
industrial applications.75 However, chlorine was identified in none of
the analyzed incidents. Similar to sophisticated weapons of chemical
warfare, obtaining radioactive material constitutes a large barrier for
its application in terrorist attacks. This is also visible in the low
number of incidents which involved radiological agents. Only four out of
the 31 analyzed incidents were found to include radioactive substances,
and reliable data was accessible for only three. Additionally, we find
no unifying characteristics in these incidents, with the incidents
ranging from the scifi-esque construction of a technically unfeasible
"death-ray," 76 to the harvesting of radioactive material from household
smoke detectors. Americium and thorium, which were acquired by Brandon
Russel, are alpha emitters, which possess only low penetration power,
making radiological toxification by external application to the human
skin unlikely. However, combining these elements with explosives, such
as the hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) found at the crime
scene, might lead to intake of radioactive splinters after penetration
of the skin, or inhalation of airborne particles into the human body
after detonating the dispersal device. Either way, detonating a "dirty
bomb" is a frightening thought to many. In conclusion, the most
frequently used agents in far-right-inspired CBRN terror incidents are
those which can be easily obtained and require low technical knowledge
for production, e.g., cyanide compounds or self-isolated ricin (21 out
of 31 incidents). Agents which are more complex to obtain, e.g.,
requiring a microbiological production 18 D. KOEHLER AND P. POPELLA
line, equipment for chemical synthesis, or the acquisition of
radiological material, constitute the minority of the incidents (10 out
of 31). Implications for law enforcement, counter-measures, and future
research The analysis of the dataset outlined in this article presents
potential challenges for law enforcement and preventative
counter-measures, if the number of actors seeking to weaponize CBRN
agents or their level of technical sophistication increase. Most of the
advanced plots in the dataset were uncovered by chance, not by
investigative work, or were never executed due to other circumstances
(e.g., the plotter being murdered or arrested for different crimes).
However, the clear majority of plots failed to materialize due to the
perpetrators' lack of capability in relation to the pursued agents'
complexity in manufacturing and weaponization. Furthermore, several
plots were detected by other unrelated criminal activities of the
perpetrators and what seems to be insufficient operational security.
Nevertheless, the growing availability of necessary chemical,
biological, and radiological components as well as technical equipment,
in combination with the willingness to plot indiscriminate attacks
within parts of the far-right environment, give reasons for concern. As
a consequence, law enforcement agencies such as the FBI rely on a
"culture of security awareness" and a "well-informed" "citizenry" 77
within the chemical and biological industries to identify potentially
dangerous individuals or groups plotting CBRN attacks as early as
possible. Building such a well-informed citizenry, however, would
require a widespread net of training programs and providers specialized
in various aspects of countering violent extremism (CVE), hand-tailored
for different target groups. Education packages such as the "State and
Local Anti-Terrorism Training Program (SLATT)" for police officers
should therefore be expanded and adapted for other target groups.
Furthermore, dedicated counselling programs helping with the initial
assessment of a potentially high-risk case have proven to be effective
in other contexts of right-wing terrorism as well, as shown by a 2017
case of a disrupted mass-shooting plot against Muslims in Florida
through concerned citizen reports.78 Future research should compare the
specific characteristics of ideologically based CBRN plots and
incidents. The data presented here poses challenges to some currently
held assumptions regarding the most likely actors behind CBRN attacks.
Far-right actors have been significantly under-researched in terrorism
studies, even though the number and successful acquisition of CBRN
agents in many of these plots over the last decades should have caused
more interest from researchers and policy makers to better understand
the risks and nature of the phenomenon in general. Finally, this article
is based on openaccess information (mostly derived from press reports
and government documents), which of course harbors a not insignificant
risk for bias and incomplete or false information. Much more verified
and independent data collection on far-right (CBRN) terrorism is
essential to increase knowledge and opportunities for comparative
research on this form of political violence. Most of the plots in the
dataset presented here have not been included in academic terrorism
databases or have not been the subject of academic research so far.
Compared with other forms, e.g., jihadist terrorism, the scrutiny and
available data for right-wing terrorism in general is still concerningly
weak. Technically, the majority of far-right CBRN plots displayed a low
complexity and sophistication and involved no likely mass casualty risk
if they had been carried out successfully. TERRORISM AND POLITICAL
VIOLENCE 19 Nevertheless, the potentially large psychological effects of
such attack scenarios in combination with an increased availability of
agents and technical knowledge, might make CBRN plots more attractive
for violent far-right (and other) extremist actors in the future.
Conclusion Far-right CBRN terrorism is rare and small in scale, but a
real threat to Western countries. For decades, a small number of
right-wing extremists have continuously attempted to and in many cases
succeeded in acquiring CBRN materials, weaponizing, and plotting to use
them in terror attacks. Even though the overall number of incidents
appears small when compared to other forms of political violence, and
the technical sophistication of the plots was very low, it must not be
overlooked that even one successful CBRN attack with an indiscriminate
target could have significant psychological or physical consequences.
This first-ever descriptive quantitative study of the characteristics of
far-right CBRN terrorism gives strong indications that this form of
right-wing terrorism has characteristics which contradict some current
widely held assumptions among academics and policy makers. Far-right
CBRN terrorism appears to be predominantly a lone-actor phenomenon,
oftentimes involving middle-aged and comparatively well-educated male
perpetrators, mostly motivated by non-religious forms of far-right
ideology and aiming for an indiscriminate targeting of victims. Based on
that assessment, law enforcement faces potentially significant
challenges in the case of a growing interest and sophistication of
domestic far-right terrorists in CBRN terror tactics, and should be
adequately trained and equipped to handle the potential threat.
Nevertheless, this analysis also points directly to the need for a whole
society approach to countering violent extremism and radicalization, as
this might be the key point of intervention. Far-right CBRN terrorism is
usually the result of long-term radicalization processes involving
elaborate careers of political violence and action, based on the age and
known biographies of the perpetrators in our sample. Finally, this
article found that right-wing CBRN terrorism has to date been rare and
mostly unsophisticated or entirely inept, which is an encouraging
outcome. However, **[it became clear that some right-wing terrorists
have been motivated to pursue CBRN materials in order to weaponize them.
Future terrorists might be more capable, and even failed or crude
attacks can have significant consequences.]{.underline}**

But [the consequences would go far beyond the effects in the target
country]{.underline}, however, [and]{.underline} promptly **[propagate
worldwide]{.underline}**. [Global and national security, economy and
finance, international governance and its framework, national political
systems, and the behavior of governments and individuals would all be
put under **severe trial**]{.underline}. The severity of the effects at
a national level, however, would depend on the countries' level of
development, geopolitical location, and resilience. [Global security and
regional/national defense schemes would be strongly
affected]{.underline}. [An **[increase in global distrust]{.mark}**
[would]{.mark} **[spark rising tensions]{.mark}** among countries
[and]{.mark} blocs]{.underline}, [that could even [lead to]{.mark} the
**brink of [nuclear weapons use]{.mark}** by states]{.underline} (if,
for instance, a sponsor country is identified). [The
[consequences]{.mark} of]{.underline} such [a shocking scenario
[would]{.mark} [include]{.mark} a **decrease in states'
self-control**]{.underline}, [an **[escalation of present
conflicts]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[emergence of new ones]{.mark}**,
[accompanied by]{.mark} an **increase in [military
unilateralism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} military expenditures]{.underline}.
Regarding the economic and financial impacts[, a **[severe global
economic depression]{.mark}** would rise from the attack]{.underline},
likely **[[lasting for years]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Its duration would
be strongly dependent on the course of the crisis. The main results of
such a crisis would include a 2 percent fall of growth in global Gross
Domestic Product, and a 4 percent decline of international trade in the
two years following the attack (cf. Figure 3). In the case of developing
and less-developed countries, the economic impacts would also include a
shortage of high-technology products such as medicines, as well as a
fall in foreign direct investment and a severe decline of international
humanitarian aid toward low-income countries. We expect an increase of
unemployment and poverty in all countries. Global poverty would raise
about 4 percent after the attack, which implies that at least 30 million
more people would be living in extreme poverty, in addition to the
current estimated 767 million. [In the area of international
relations]{.underline}, [we would expect a **breakdown of key
doctrines** involving politics]{.underline}, [security, and relations
among states]{.underline}. These [**[international tensions could lead
to a collapse of the nuclear order]{.mark}** as we know it
today]{.underline}, [with a consequent **[setback]{.mark} of nuclear
disarmament** and **[nonproliferation]{.mark}
commitments**]{.underline}. In other words, [[the whole]{.mark} system
based on the Nuclear **[N]{.mark}**on- **[P]{.mark}**roliferation
**[T]{.mark}**reaty [would be put under **severe
trial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [After the attack]{.underline}, [there
would be a reassessment of existing security doctrines]{.underline}, and
a deep review of concepts such as nuclear deterrence, no-firstuse,
proportionality, and negative security assurances. Finally, the behavior
of governments and individuals would also change radically. **[[Internal
chaos]{.underline}]{.mark}** [fueled by the media and social networks
would **[threaten governance at all levels]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [with
greater impact on those countries with weak institutional
frameworks]{.underline}. [**[Social turbulence]{.mark}** would
[emerge]{.mark} in most countries]{.underline}, [with consequent
**attempts by governments to impose restrictions on personal freedoms to
preserve order**]{.underline} -- possibly [by declaring a state of siege
or **state of emergency**]{.underline} -- and [legislation would surely
become tougher on human rights]{.underline}. [[There
would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[significant increase in social fragmentation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- with a [deepening of antagonistic views]{.underline},

dw

The Trump administration is in [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} midst of
making a [[decision]{.underline}]{.mark} on whether [[to transfer lethal
weaponry]{.underline}]{.mark} to Ukraine. This potential move
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} intended [[to give Ukraine]{.mark}'s military
[the ability to impose new costs on the Russians]{.mark}]{.underline}
and their proxies engaged in a separatist revolt in the country's
eastern region of Donbass, thereby [[persuading the Kremlin to give up
the fight]{.mark}.]{.underline} But [[the result
would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[be]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[opposite]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[an escalation]{.mark} in the
conflict that [would lead to further losses]{.mark} of Ukraine's
territory and compromise its political stability]{.underline}.
[[Russia]{.mark} [enjoys insurmountable military
superiority]{.mark}]{.underline} over Ukraine. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should not encourage Ukraine to engage in an
escalatory confrontation with Russia]{.underline}. Washington knows full
well that **[[Ukraine cannot prevail.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [The
urge]{.underline} to give Ukraine lethal arms --- most likely in the
form of anti-tank weapons --- [is understandable]{.underline}. Since
2014, the Russians have occupied and illegally annexed Crimea and
sustained a separatist rebellion in Donbass that has claimed more than
10,000 lives. Moreover, [Russia has engaged in]{.underline} these [acts
of aggression]{.underline} in order to block Ukraine's desire to leave
Moscow's sphere of influence and join the community of Western
democracies. Under these circumstances, the United States should
continue helping Ukrainians defend themselves by assisting with defense
reforms and training Ukrainian forces. So why not take the next step and
give Ukraine lethal weapons? For starters, [[the notion
that]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir [[Putin would give
up his hold on Donbass if a few more Russians come home in body bags is
to dramatically misread the Kremlin]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Putin is a
master at manipulating the]{.underline} Russian [public]{.underline},
[especially when it comes to]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline}
conflict [and would hardly fold]{.underline} his hand [if Russian
casualties were to increase.]{.underline} On the contrary, **[[he would
likely double down]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [blaming the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and Ukraine [for the
intensified fighting]{.underline} and taking steps to offset the
improvement in Ukraine's military capability. [[The Russians
have]{.mark} so far effectively [countered]{.mark} Ukrainian military
successes]{.underline} --- in some instances, [[retaliating with
devastating effect]{.underline}]{.mark}. When Ukrainian forces in the
summer of 2014 advanced into Donbass and took the strategically located
city of Ilovaisk, Putin promptly called in his own crack troops, which
quickly decimated the Ukrainian unit that had taken the town. [Should
Putin decide to escalate]{.underline} in response to a U.S. decision to
transfer lethal weapons to Ukraine, [Washington would have few arrows in
its quiver]{.underline}. Even if the Trump administration were to take
another step up the ladder of escalation, [Russia would go at least one
step further]{.underline}. [[Russia shares]{.underline}
[a]{.underline}]{.mark} 1500-mile land/sea [[border]{.mark} with
Ukraine, [making the Kremlin far more invested]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the fate of Ukraine than Washington. Russia has greater interest in
putting skin in the game. Rather than playing to Russia's principal
strength --- its military advantage over Ukraine -- [the United States
should continue to play to Russia's main vulnerability]{.underline} ---
[its economic weakness]{.underline}. [On this front, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its European allies, not
the Kremlin, [hold the cards]{.underline}. [The loss of income due to
the low price of fossil fuels and]{.underline} the international
[sanctions]{.underline} imposed [in response to]{.underline} its
[aggression in Ukraine have taken a serious toll]{.underline} on the
Russian economy. [[Keeping sanctions]{.mark} in place]{.underline} and,
if necessary, increasing them, [[is the West's best source of
leverage]{.mark} for pushing Russia to a diplomatic
solution]{.underline}. Congress seems to realize as much, having just
imposed on the White House legislation tightening U.S. sanctions against
Russia. [[Sending lethal weapons to Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} has one
further downside --- it [[would cause a rift between]{.mark} the United
States and its main [European allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Germany and
France have been leading]{.underline} diplomatic [efforts to find a
diplomatic solution]{.underline} for Donbass --- and [both have long
opposed sending lethal weapons to Ukraine]{.underline} because of its
potential to escalate the conflict. The United States and Europe have
moved in lock step since the beginning of the conflict, closely
coordinating non-lethal military assistance to Ukraine as well as
economic sanctions against Russia. Transatlantic solidarity has arguably
been the West's strongest suit, confronting Putin with a united front
and keeping Russia in the penalty box despite pressure from parties on
both sides of the Atlantic to drop sanctions and reap the accompanying
commercial benefits. Europeans are already on edge due to Congress's
recent sanctions legislation, which imposes measures not coordinated
with the European Union and that have the potential to cause undue harm
to European companies. If Washington decides to head off on its own and
send lethal weapons to Ukraine, solidarity on Ukraine may well come to
end. [[Putin has been working hard to achieve just this
end]{.underline}]{.mark}. Washington would be making a serious strategic
mistake if it hands to the Kremlin the transatlantic bust-up for which
Moscow has long been hoping. The conflict in Ukraine promises to poison
Russia's relations with the West until a diplomatic resolution is
reached. But [[sending lethal weapons to Ukraine is a recipe for
military escalation and transatlantic discord]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
best way to bring peace]{.underline} to Ukraine [is through
transatlantic unity aimed at maintaining Russia's political and economic
isolation]{.underline} until it makes a deal at the negotiating table.

<http://www.aspeninstitutece.org/en/article/1-2014-why-the-us-needs-europe/>)

This crisis notwithstanding, [[the U.S. needs]{.mark} closer engagement
with [Europe]{.mark} on crucial defense and foreign policy
matters]{.underline}. The U.S. under President Obama may be turning
inward; but the fact remains: [Europe is vital and
irreplaceable]{.underline} to us. History and culture bind the U.S. and
Europe together; Europe discovered us, shaped our thinking, and forms of
government. But there is more than just cultural affinity that unites
us. There is a deep moral scope to the alliance. It was, after all, in
the West that concepts such as limited government, individual rights,
freedom of worship, free markets, and equal rights for women arose. The
moral basis of our alliance embodied in these concepts was critical to
our heroic joint efforts leading the fierce external opposition to
totalitarianism that helped bring down the Iron Curtain. [The
[common]{.mark} defense [threats]{.mark} we face in the 21st
century---almost all on the periphery of the U.S. or the
EU---[are]{.mark} different in scope and kind: conventional challenges
such as **[Russia]{.mark} bent on dominating** its near abroad or
**[China]{.mark}'s increasing assertiveness** in territorial matters and
growing military prowess; others are unconventional, including the
**spread of radical Islam and [terrorism]{.mark} in the Middle East**
and beyond, and the **[prolif]{.mark}eration of weapons of mass
destruction to countries such as [Iran]{.mark} and [No]{.mark}rth
[Ko]{.mark}rea**. In an age of extremist ideologies, **[non-state actors
with]{.mark} increasingly widespread [tech]{.mark}nological capacities**
could pose the **greatest threats of all to international
order**]{.underline}. [Other [challenges]{.mark} that [arise from the
**"arc of instability"** to the south of
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}---including migration and unruly political
transitions in the Arab world---[require a mix of hard and soft power.
[The **diplomatic**]{.mark} **[flex]{.mark}ibility** [that approaches by
a **multiplicity of states** in Europe can
affor]{.mark}d]{.underline}--- combined with the potential threat of
hard power when necessary---[[offers the **most diverse set of
tools**]{.mark} to handle such crises]{.underline}. Our moral message
and policy prescriptions are much stronger when unified; we are able to
achieve far more together than alone. But to achieve unity, as the last
decade has shown, we really have to work at it. This means more than
occasional consultations, after the fact, as has often been the case
during the Obama administration. Strong U.S.-European relations require
regular consultations, give and take, even blunt conversations--- not
just lectures from Washington or from Brussels or European capitals---to
give Europeans a stake of ownership in policies. This ownership will
allow them and us to make the case for shared sacrifice to their and our
polities---a case that needs to be made in politics since the choices
officials face in security policy are often less than optimal. The
failure of American leadership since 2009 to make such arguments at home
has weakened our ability to expect our allies to make the same kinds of
cases to their publics, thereby harming the alliance. [**American cannot
"go it alone."** [Europe offers]{.mark} America an **invaluable tool**:
[a **key multilateral dimension**]{.mark} to policy. [With it, comes
**greater credibility**]{.mark} in the international arena [and]{.mark}
[a **greater capacity** to]{.mark} undertake complex
[missions]{.mark}]{.underline}. America has to lead, but Europe has to
be our partner, willing to be vocal when we are unwilling to meet out
responsibilities. Without it comes the excessive swings of American
foreign and defense policy that have led us, in recent years, to shirk
our global responsibilities. Europeans contributed in crucial ways to
the US-led interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan and were absolutely
central to the intervention in Libya. France's willingness to intervene
in Mali and the Central African Republic with assistance from the U.S.
and the E.U. at a time when the U.S. is less willing on new anti-terror
interventions is a very positive sign. But French interventionism, as
welcome as it is, cannot make up for shrinking defense budgets and
reluctant leadership from both Germany and the U.K. The U.S. needs to
encourage its allies to assume their responsibilities. Although Europe's
armed forces are less strong and less well equipped than desirable,
European armed forces are, in fact, well-trained, technologically
sophisticated and also geographically closer to the regions that are
likely to be critical in the 21st century---North Africa, the Middle
East, Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The manpower and cost
efficiencies from potential joint operations cannot be overstated.
Europeans can bring unmatched sensibilities in their own backyard, but
need to assume their responsibilities. Their knowledge of history and
culture is essential. This knowledge and willingness to use "soft power"
has to be joined to a sense of the importance of burden sharing,
especially as American forces are overstretched in a time of declining
American defense budgets. Increasing isolationism in both American
political parties should serve as a wakeup call to Europe that we might
not always be there to help police Europe's periphery as in Kosovo or
Libya. The greater distance we are assuming from Europe should make us
all the more sympathetic to European defense initiatives. Given the
deeper challenges we face, it is time to leave aside "theological"
debates over whether NATO or the EU should be the prime focus for the
future of European defense. Instead, we need to focus on how best to
meet common strategic challenges with the array of resources, diplomatic
and military, that we can muster. [When Europeans and Americans work
together]{.underline} for shared purpose, [the partnership]{.underline}
enhances us both and [makes]{.underline} our [complex]{.underline} and
simultaneous [missions much easier to accomplish]{.underline}.

### 2ac - AT -- "Defensive Weapons"

#### Defensive weapons don't deter Russia; Russian officials use them as an excuse to attack

[Russian officials have said the **US decision to supply weapons to
[Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine) will fuel
conflict** in the east of the country. The US state department said on
Friday that it would provide Ukraine with "enhanced defensive
capabilities" as it continued to fight Russia-backed separatists in a
low-intensity conflict.]{.underline} Until now, the US has only provided
Ukraine with support equipment and training. It has also allowed private
companies to sell small arms such as rifles to the country. But it is
understood that arms such as the US-made Javelin anti-tank missiles can
now be delivered to Ukraine. This was unconfirmed by the state
department, however. [Russia's deputy foreign minister, Grigory Karasin,
told Russian state media that the US decision "raises the danger of
derailing the process of peaceful settlement in Ukraine". The de facto
change in policy, signed off by the state department and the Pentagon
earlier this year, is **likely to escalate tensions** between the US and
[Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia).]{.underline} Barack
Obama had considered sending weapons to Ukraine when he was president of
the US, but stopped short of directly providing heavy armaments. Donald
Trump, Obama's successor, is contending with widespread criticism that
he has been soft on Russia, amid [allegations that Russian
interference](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/16/qa-russian-hackers-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-us-presidential-election)
in the 2016 US election contributed to his victory. "[US assistance is
entirely defensive in nature, and as we have always said, Ukraine is a
sovereign country and has a right to defend itself," said Heather
Nauert, spokeswoman for the state department. But European leaders urged
the parties involved in the negotiation of a ceasefire to face their
responsibilities and implement the agreed plan. The German chancellor,
Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in a
joint statement that "there is no alternative to an exclusively peaceful
settlement of the conflict".]{.underline} They also called for the
return of Russian officers to the Joint Centre for Control and
Coordination in Ukraine, which is helping to facilitate the ceasefire,
after their withdrawal on Wednesday[. A civil war has been waged between
pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian government forces since Russia
annexed [Crimea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/crimea) in 2014. More
than 10,000 people have died in the conflict so far. Kiev has accused
Moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which Russia
denies, while Washington says Moscow is arming, training and fighting
alongside the separatists. The Russian foreign ministry said the **US
decision undermined the [2015 Minsk
agreement](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/ukraine-crisis-minsk-ceasefire-agreement-detailshttps:/www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/ukraine-crisis-minsk-ceasefire-agreement-details),
which was intended to end the fighting in Ukraine**.]{.underline}

[The U.S. has announced it will sell Ukraine 210 Javelin anti-tank
missiles and 37 launchers,
[worth](https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-announces-sale-anti-tank-missiles-ukraine-russian/story?id=53450406)
\$47 million. The sale marks a significant increase in U.S. military
support for Ukraine]{.underline} --- the first lethal weapons sale of
its kind since Russian-backed separatists launched a war against the
central government in Ukraine\'s eastern provinces. [ABC News first
broke
news](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/sources-trump-expected-announce-approval-plan-sell-anti/story?id=51957745)
of the sale in December when [[President
Trump](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/donald-trump.htm) approved the
plan and began informal notifications with Congress about
it]{.underline}. With Thursday\'s formal notification, [Congress now has
30 days to sink the deal or it will go through]{.underline}, which is
expected. The Trump administration has touted the sale as evidence it is
\"tougher\" on Russia than President Barack Obama, although its Special
Representative for Ukraine Negotiations sought to downplay the
significance on Monday. \"[There is what I view as an artificial
distinction between lethal and non-lethal military
equipment]{.underline},\" Ambassador Kurt Volker said in Washington on
Monday, comparing anti-tank missiles to a counter-battery radar that
improves targeting to attack and kill an enemy firing mortars. \"That\'s
non-lethal and an anti-tank missile, which sits in a box and doesn't get
used unless you have a tank coming at you, is lethal. Both are clearly
defensive weapons.\" [The sale is intended to boost Ukrainian military
forces as they continue to fight Russian-backed separatists, according
to U.S. officials, who argue the U.S. is only supporting Ukraine\'s
right to self-defense.]{.underline} \"The Javelin system will help
Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity to defend its sovereignty
and territorial integrity in order to meet its national defense
requirements,\" [the

Defense [Security
Cooperation](https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-announces-sale-anti-tank-missiles-ukraine-russian/story?id=53450406)
Agency said in a statement Thursday. U.S. personnel will travel to
Ukraine to train their military on its use, the agency added. Russia has
not yet commented on the official notification, but Sergei Ryabkov,
[Russia\'s deputy foreign minister, responded harshly in December when
news of the sale first broke. \"The United States in a certain sense
crossed the line, announcing the intention to
[transfer](https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-announces-sale-anti-tank-missiles-ukraine-russian/story?id=53450406)
weapons of direct damaging action to Ukraine]{.underline},\" the
statement said, translated from Russian. \"American weapons can lead to
new victims in our neighboring country, to which we cannot remain
indifferent.\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry [Peskov said then that the
sale \"will once again motivate the hotheads\" in the Ukrainian
government and \"unleash bloodshed again.\" But since then, there has
not been a major escalation in the conflict, despite concerns about
Russian retaliation. That could be in part because, \"the prospect for
increasing the conflict is just too costly for Russia even if you are
talking about asymmetric warfare,\" according to Volker]{.underline}.
Fighting in Ukraine rages on with multiple ceasefire violations and some
fatalities each week, according to monitoring groups with the
Organization for
[Security](https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-announces-sale-anti-tank-missiles-ukraine-russian/story?id=53450406)
and Cooperation in Europe, or OECD. Ukraine loses a soldier every three
days, Volker said Monday. [More than 10,000 people have been killed
since the start of the conflict four years ago]{.underline}, but the
battlefield\'s lines have been frozen for years now, with a diplomatic
solution still out of reach. In July, the Trump administration appointed
Volker, who served in the George W. Bush administration, including as
U.S. ambassador to
[NATO](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/nato.htm), at the request
of Russia, Germany, and France, who wanted a direct American counterpart
with whom they could negotiate peace talks. Scott J.
Ferrell/Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images In recent months, he has
been advocating for [United
Nations](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/united-nations.htm)
peacekeepers to take over in the east and secure the areas for local
elections while the government in Kiev would take on reforms --- all of
which is spelled out in the Minsk agreements, peace deals that Russia
and Ukraine signed. \"We've been at this for about seven months, and I
have to say that I\'m very pleased with the positioning, but I am not
pleased with the results because there are no results,\" Volker said.
While [the incentive of lifting U.S. [sanctions on
Russia](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/issues/sanctions-on-russia.htm)
has not changed their calculus, Volker said the new weapons are a sign
to Russia that they will not change the battlefield through force. The
Obama administration and [European
Union](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/european-union.htm) worked
in tandem in 2014 to sanction top Russian officials for the country\'s
incursion into eastern Ukraine and seizure of
[Crimea](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/crimea.htm), and the Trump
administration has pledged repeatedly to keep those sanctions in place
until Russia meets its commitments under the Minsk agreements. Trump\'s
approval of the arms deal was a major shift from the [Republican
party](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/republican-party.htm)
platform, which was amended when Trump was the party\'s nominee for
president, from supporting \"lethal defensive arms\" to Ukraine to the
more vague \"appropriate assistance" --- language that ran counter to
traditional Republican foreign policy. Trump himself promised a reset
with Russia, but since taking office, relations with Moscow have not
improved.]{.underline}

### 2ac -- yes escalation

#### Arms sales with Ukraine will result in an escalating military conflict with Russia

[The Trump administration has approved the largest U.S. commercial sale
of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine since 2014. The move was heavily
supported by]{.underline} top [Trump]{.underline} national security
Cabinet officials and Congress [but may complicate]{.underline}
President [Trump's stated ambition to work with]{.underline} Russian
President Vladimir [Putin. Administration officials
confirmed]{.underline} that the State Department this month approved a
commercial license authorizing the export of Model M107A1 Sniper
Systems, ammunition, and associated parts and accessories to Ukraine, [a
sale valued at \$41.5 million. These weapons address a specific
vulnerability of Ukrainian forces fighting a Russian-backed separatist
movement in two eastern provinces. There has been no approval to export
the heavier weapons the Ukrainian government is asking for]{.underline},
such as Javelin antitank missiles. Congress authorized such sales in
2014 in the [Ukraine Freedom Support
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2828), but
the Obama administration never authorized large commercial or government
sales, a move widely seen as a de facto decision not to provide lethal
weapons to the Ukraine military. Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who co-sponsored the law, praised the
Trump administration's move. "I'm pleased the administration approved
the sale of defensive lethal arms to Ukraine," Corker told me. "[This
decision was supported by Congress in legislation that became law three
years ago and reflects our country's longstanding commitment to Ukraine
in the face of ongoing Russian aggression."]{.underline} A State
Department spokesperson, speaking on background, said that although [the
United States has now licensed the commercial export of lethal weapons
to Ukraine,]{.underline} the U.S. government has not sold or given
weapons directly to Ukraine. There's never been any official policy on
such sales one way or another, the spokesperson said, adding that this
license was granted on a case-by-case basis. There were licenses granted
for small commercial sales of small arms to Ukraine before this year
Another senior Trump administration official said that Trump personally
approved the decision to allow the issuing of the license after being
presented a decision memo by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson. While there was never a formal ban on such
weapons transfers, the decision was discussed internally as a lifting of
the de facto Obama administration restrictions, the official said. [As I
reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-administration-stalled-on-whether-to-arm-ukraine/2017/10/29/f83874da-bb53-11e7-a908-a3470754bbb9_story.html?utm_term=.2c92e362d3ca)
in October, the decision over whether to allow lethal arms sales to
Ukraine had been sitting on Trump's desk for months. The [National
Security](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/12/20/trump-administration-approves-lethal-arms-sales-to-ukraine/?utm_term=.6d8d8db29ac5)
Council's Principals Committee, which includes Cabinet members, met
months ago and provided several options to the president. Experts and
officials said Trump's chosen option was measured[; he didn't approve
everything the Ukrainians asked for but nonetheless crossed the line of
approving lethal sales, a significant shift in his administration's
approach and U.S. policy overall.]{.underline} "We have crossed the
Rubicon, this is lethal weapons and I predict more will be coming," said
one senior congressional official. It's likely no mere coincidence that
[Canada also
approved](https://www.globalresearch.ca/canada-becomes-party-to-ukraines-conflict-sells-lethal-weapons-to-kiev-regime/5623197)
lethal defense sales to Ukraine this week, which would happen only if
the Canadian government knew the United States was on board, the
official said. The Trump administration notified leading congressional
committees of the sale on Dec. 13 but didn't make any public
announcements, which some say reflects the sensitivity of the decision
and concern about how it will be received by Trump supporters who long
opposed the move, as well as by Putin. "The way it was *not* rolled out
tells you something, that they are concerned about the perception of
this. They are not trumpeting this as a major policy shift or signature
policy priority," said [Samuel
Charap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1138633089/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=washpost-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1138633089&linkId=b0bd768a75ff5aff8f77dae3c4b38633),

political scientist at the Rand Corporation. The administration's
strategy of approving very limited arms sales is akin to a "Goldilocks"
approach, he said, because it attempts to satisfy advocates while not
sparking negative reaction by those who fear such a move could risk
escalating the crisis. [One senior administration official who
previously warned]{.underline} of this very risk is Fiona Hill, now the
senior National

Council director for Russia. She argued in a [2015 Post
op-ed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/giving-weapons-to-ukraine-could-goad-putin-into-a-regional-war/2015/02/05/ec2e9680-abf5-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html?utm_term=.82907f22c1dc)that
if the United States arms Ukraine, ["the Ukrainians won't be the only
ones caught in an escalating military conflict with
Russia."]{.underline} It's unclear whether Hill still holds that view,
but other top Trump officials have been clear they support sending
lethal arms to Ukraine. [Mattis
[said](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/world/europe/mattis-ukraine-russia.html)
in Kiev in August that "defensive weapons are not provocative unless you
are an aggressor, and clearly Ukraine is not an aggressor]{.underline}."
Tillerson
[declared](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/aide-says-us-should-have-armed-ukraine-gw6bx68vs)
his support in his Senate confirmation hearing. Tillerson's part-time
special envoy on the Ukraine crisis, former U.S. ambassador to NATO Kurt
Volker, [told me last
month](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/putins-proposal-for-ukraine-is-another-trap-for-trump/2017/11/26/2b238622-cfc3-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html?utm_term=.e5544c044b2d)
he also supports providing lethal weapons to Ukraine. Volker is working
with Moscow to revive a peace plan known as Minsk2, but progress is
scarce. [According to Volker]{.underline}, Russia has not fulfilled any
of its obligations, which include removing its unacknowledged troops and
heavy weapons from Ukrainian territory. His argument is that [the costs
of Russia's intervention should increase, making Putin choose whether to
bear that burden or strike a deal.]{.underline} Others, including
Mattis, see the sales as a principled signal that the United States will
support its allies. They say Ukraine [is simply defending its own
territory](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/world/europe/mattis-ukraine-russia.html?_r=0)
and therefore lethal weapons shouldn't be seen as a provocation.
Meanwhile, [the fighting in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine is heating
up. According to a BBC report this week, Moscow is pulling all of its
[personnel](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2017/12/20/trump-administration-approves-lethal-arms-sales-to-ukraine/?utm_term=.6d8d8db29ac5)
from a Russian-Ukrainian [joint
center](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42402390) that is meant to
monitor a frequently violated truce. Trump himself has consistently
stated his desire to work with Putin to resolve the Ukraine crisis,
dating back to his presidential campaign.]{.underline} During [the 2016
GOP
convention](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html?utm_term=.ed83aef027ef),
the Trump campaign beat back efforts to have the Republican platform
endorse lethal assistance to Ukraine. Trump campaign officials pushed to
soften a proposed amendment to remove the language "lethal defensive
weapons" and replace it with "appropriate assistance." Trump has now
decided that lethal defensive weapons constitute "appropriate
assistance." His decision to approve small amounts of weapons sales
likely won't fundamentally change Putin's calculus or the trajectory of
the war in Ukraine. But it's one sure sign that Trump's foreign policy
views are evolving --- or at least being influenced --- as his
presidency progresses.

### 2ac - at - no russian military power

[[Russia today poses a greater foreign policy and security challenge to
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and its Western allies than at any
time since the height of the Cold War]{.mark}. Its]{.underline}
annexation of Crimea, war in Ukraine's Donbas region, and military
intervention in Syria have upended Western calculations from Eastern
Europe to the Middle East. Russia's intervention in Syria, in
particular, is a stark reminder that Russia is a multi-regional
power---as much by intent as by geography. [[Under- or overestimating
Russia's capabilities]{.mark}---and those of Russian President Vladimir
Putin---can [lead to dangerous policy miscalculations and strategic
surprises]{.mark}. If [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies
are not to be continually surprised, we [will have to put more resources
behind understanding what is happening inside Russia, as well as
analyzing the complex of Russia's interactions
internationally]{.mark}]{.underline}. We need a more holistic approach
if we are to succeed in identifying workable policy solutions. RUSSIA'S
MILITARY MOMENTUM [[Putin's current challenge is to]{.mark} maintain the
military momentum Russia first gained with its war against Georgia in
August 2008, and to [keep taking the West by surprise, as it has in both
Ukraine and Syria]{.mark}. Russia may, however, be coming to its limits
for conducting larger-scale military operations. In
Ukraine]{.underline}, part of the impetus for dampening down the
conflict over the last several weeks---along with securing sanctions
relief and pocketing gains on the ground---is that the war in the Donbas
region has been relatively costly in the context of Russia's
partially-implemented rearmament program, which did not really begin
until 2011. The current Russian economic downturn, created by a
confluence of plummeting energy prices and Western sanctions, has
squeezed Russia's defense budget. Indeed, Western sanctions (enhanced in
the wake of the 2014 shoot-down of the Malaysian airliner by Russian
rebels) hit Russia just as the efforts to reinvigorate Russia's defense
industry hit their stride, depriving Russia of access to critical
foreign technology and budget revenues. The intervention in Syria has
further compounded the military's replacement problem. The costs of the
Syrian campaign are difficult to calculate---they are not just the total
of [the Russian military's declared
costs](http://www.themoscowtimes.com/business/article/calculating-the-cost-of-russias-war-in-syria/540015.html),
which seem quite low. But, the Syrians are not paying for the armaments
and assistance they receive from Russia. [[Russia's dilemma is now one
of prioritization]{.underline}]{.mark}---[where to allocate its budget,
and where and how to deploy its (relatively limited) trained
manpower]{.underline}. Russian military planners are still absorbing the
impact of economic decline on their resources. Beyond the limits of men
and materiel, they are also (like Western military planners) uncertain
about what might come next in the international arena. For Russia and
the Putin team, being at war in the Middle East is unfamiliar territory.
This is a very different kind of intervention from Georgia and Ukraine,
and from Russia's own civil wars with Chechnya. Russia's goal in Syria
is to consolidate the Assad regime's position on the ground to ensure
Bashar Assad's hold on to power until a better arrangement is devised
through international negotiations---with Moscow in a lead position (as
Putin has insisted from the start of the war). Intervening in Syria to
achieve this goal was a high-stakes gambit. It requires many other
players---not just the United States---to play along with Moscow, on the
ground and at the negotiating table. In the case of Ukraine, [since
March 2014 Russia has vacillated between and among applications of
military force, economic pressure, and political negotiations---with the
Ukrainians, with Europeans, and with the United States]{.underline}
(over the heads of everyone else). Moscow is constantly testing to see
which avenue is most promising at a particular juncture to press
Russia's advantage, and to ensure it can always leave its
[options](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/03/03/russian-adventurism-and-the-u-s-long-game/)
open. To Putin's chagrin, there has been no replay of the bloodless
seizure of Crimea---he has not managed to secure a quick military
victory in the Donbas. There will similarly be no easy victory in Syria,
where the risks increase every day. [Turkey's shoot-down of a Russian

in November 2015 provoked a serious rift between Moscow and Ankara.
There are a lot more things that can go wrong in both Ukraine and Syria.
KEEPING UP APPEARANCES [At all turns, [Putin]{.mark} has shown he is
willing to take the risk that things will go wrong, and to pay a high
economic and diplomatic price as he [seeks to tip regional balances of
power in Europe and the Middle East in Moscow's favor]{.mark}. He has
upset the "reset" of relations with the United States, lost
"modernization partnerships" with Germany and the European Union, and
ruptured relations with NATO. [Many of Russia's]{.mark} other foreign
[relationships are]{.mark} also [strained]{.mark}***.***]{.underline}

How long can this continue? [Can Putin keep the population mobilized
behind his presidency if things start to go badly]{.underline} wrong for
the Russian military operation in Syria? You can be sure that Vladimir
Putin is also considering this question carefully.

[[The legitimacy of the current Russian]{.mark} political [system
depends]{.mark} almost entirely [on]{.mark} the maintenance of
[Putin's]{.mark} charismatic authority and his [record]{.mark} as a
leader]{.underline}. [If the Russian people lose their faith in Putin as
president, then the whole political system risks becoming
destabilized]{.underline}. 

With the economic downturn, [[Putin]{.mark} and hi[s]{.mark} inner
circle are [under pressure to keep delivering foreign policy victories,
which]{.mark} have [boost]{.mark}ed Putin's [popularity]{.mark} in
Russia]{.underline}. His approval rating has hovered around 90 percent,
in part because of the siege mentality that has progressively taken hold
in Russia, but also because the Russian public generally supports
Putin's display and use of force to assert Russia's foreign policy
interests. [Public opinion surveys show a broad-based conviction among
Russians that the United States and the West are "out to get them." [In
the context of]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} crisis and the
war in Syria, [[this has given Putin a clear---but
temporary---advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Although the Russian economy and the state budget have taken a beating
since 2013, [the [wars]{.mark} have helped to [deflect]{.mark} public
[attention]{.mark} away from economic and political
demands]{.underline}. **[Putin]{.mark}** [and hi[s]{.mark} team have
[been able to blame]{.mark} all of Russia's [woes on]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and on Western [actions]{.mark} and
sanctions]{.underline}.

PLAYING THE LONG GAME

Ultimately, in pursuing Russia's goals, [[Putin is a
pragmatist]{.underline}]{.mark}. He has to keep a watchful eye on the
home front, and Russia does not have the military or economic resources
for the mass-army, total mobilization approach that it adopted during
the Cold War to defend itself against the United States and NATO. [Putin
has]{.underline} to combine conventional, nuclear, and non-conventional,
non-military---so-called "[hybrid"---means of defense]{.underline}.
Russia's military modernization program has been geared toward this.

[Putin]{.underline} ha[s]{.underline} also applied his operative's
approach, as a former KGB agent, to [[thinking about how to deter the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies from considering taking
any military action]{.underline} against Russia---[[in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, Syria, or elsewhere. [[He]{.mark} has [put
everything on the table]{.mark}, showing that Russia has the capacity to
act and the will to escalate]{.underline}. [Nuclear weapons only have
real deterrent value if they can be instrumentalized like the rest of
the Russian military---so, Putin and his team are [drawing up a
contingency for deploying Russia's nuclear arsenal]{.mark} in some
way]{.underline}. The goal is to push the United States and NATO away
from Russia and out of its neighborhood, not actually to engage in a
nuclear exchange.

All [this makes it tricky for the United States to devise strategies and
policies for dealing with Russia]{.underline}. Given all the factors at
work in Russia and the international arena---including the informal
nature of power and the role of personalized politics in Moscow, as well
as Putin's operative thinking about the Russian military and nuclear
arsenal---[[the U.S. security response]{.mark} to the Russian challenge
[will have to encompass the arc of a long game]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Strategic patience must]{.mark} accompany the judicious
[balance]{.mark} of elements of [deterrence, defense, and
constraint]{.mark}, along with clear incentives [and direct
engagement]{.mark} with Putin]{.underline} and his inner circle.

[We need to understand the nature of Russian threat perceptions and
Russia's long-term perspectives]{.underline}. Managing the U.S.-Russia
relationship will require a considerable attention inside and outside
government, and close coordination with our allies on analysis and
policies.

### 2ac - Security Dilemma

#### United States arms sales perpetuate Ukrainian conflict and escalate tensions between the United States and Russia

**Semchuk 19**, By, Liana \"U.S. arms sales to Ukraine keeping the
conflict alive,\" UPI, 3-27-2019,

[Selling lethal weapons to Ukraine is the equivalent of pouring kerosene
onto a flame]{.underline}. But [ongoing hostilities between Ukraine and
Russia]{.underline} \-- including the Kerch strait crisis, which began
late last year when Russia intercepted three Ukrainian vessels and took
24 crew members captive \-- [are]{.underline} also [a major business
opportunity for the world\'s largest defense contractors.]{.underline}
Despite the risk of serious escalation, these companies continue to
provide Ukraine with lethal aid so it can defend itself against Russia
\-- for a price, of course. The [U.S. special representative for Ukraine
negotiations]{.underline}, Kurt Volker, stated recently that Washington
remains committed to providing support to Ukraine and its military,
including anti-tank systems. He even [hinted that the United States is
considering expanding the types of lethal aid that it could begin
selling to Ukraine]{.underline}, saying: \"We also need to be looking at
things [like **air defense and coastal defense**]{.underline}.\" **[This
is a troubling prospect]{.underline}**. In March, U.S. Army Gen. Curtis
Scaparrotti said that the United States could also bolster the Ukrainian
military\'s sniper capabilities. Speaking to the Senate Armed Services
Committee, he said: \"There are other systems, sniper systems,
ammunition and, perhaps looking at the Kerch Strait, perhaps
consideration for naval systems, as well, here in the future as we move
forward.\" This comment has been widely underreported and has not
received nearly as much attention as it deserves considering the
potential consequences. At worst, [more lethal aid could escalate the
conflict further]{.underline}. At best, [it will continue to keep alive
a conflict that has killed more than 10,000.]{.underline} Finding a
straightforward policy alternative is difficult, but [sending more
lethal aid to achieve the unattainable goal of Ukraine defeating Russia
is certainly no solution.]{.underline} Impact Despite attempts by Volker
and Scaparrotti to market the proposition as a way to help Ukraine
defend itself against Russia, the immediate benefits seem clearer to
America\'s weapons manufacturing sector than to Ukrainian civilians, who
will undoubtedly get caught in the cross-fire. The Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute reported that the United States
is home to five of the world\'s 10 largest defense contractors. Lockheed
Martin, by far the largest in the field, in 2017 had an estimated \$44.9
billion in arms contracts globally. The company was also contracted
(with Raytheon) in 2018 to provide Ukraine with Javelin anti-tank
missiles. The U.S. Pentagon said: \"The Javelin system will help Ukraine
build its long-term defense capacity to defend its sovereignty and
territorial integrity in order to meet its national defense
requirements.\" But Lockheed Martin likely profited handsomely from the
deal. Meanwhile, the company\'s financial reports showed fourth quarter
2018 net sales of \$14.4 billion, compared to \$13.8 billion in the
fourth quarter of 2017. This year, the company is expecting sales to
grow by as much as 6 percent. This is unlikely to be the case if the
number of conflicts around the world declines. It\'s clear why
Washington wants to sell more weapons to Ukraine. But whether Ukraine
remains receptive and willing to continue buying them may hinge on the
outcome of the upcoming presidential election, which is scheduled for
Sunday. Presidential candidate Volodymyr Zelensky, who is leading in the
polls, seems to offer hope that Ukraine may change its current strategy.
This is reflected in a statement Zelensky made in March in which he
emphasized the need to negotiate with Russia in order to \"save
people\'s lives.\" Is there a solution? As well as better diplomacy,
Zelensky also sees direct democracy as a way to resolve the crisis.
Rather than pursuing the same ineffective policy, which has achieved
absolutely nothing except for a greater death toll and growing human
misery, he proposed a referendum on the outcome of his negotiations with
Russia on the conflict in eastern Ukraine. This approach might not lead
to a quick fix or immediately restore peace in the region \-- but it is
more likely to succeed than simply supplying more weapons with which to
prolong the fighting. The West should not abandon its rhetoric of
support for Ukraine\'s territorial integrity. But
[policymakers]{.underline} and society more broadly [should be careful
not to assume that simply selling more weapons to Ukraine will yield a
definitive victory over Russia and its separatist allies.]{.underline}
While the ongoing war in the eastern Donbas region and the recent Kerch
incident offer an opportunity for big businesses to make a profit, it\'s
ordinary people who will pay the price. [The current approach to
de-escalating the conflict needs to be dramatically re-evaluated \-- and
lethal weapons must be taken off the negotiating table.]{.underline}

Lethal Weapons to Ukraine,\" Cato Institute, 9-10-2018,
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/washington-quietly-increases-lethal-weapons-ukraine
dw

For all of the loose (frequently hysterical) talk in Congress, the
foreign policy community, and the news media about President Donald
Trump's alleged eagerness to appease Vladimir Putin, **[U.S. policy
remains as confrontational as ever toward Russia.]{.underline}** Among
other actions, the [Trump]{.underline} administration has [involved U.S.
forces in NATO military exercises]{.underline} (war games) in Poland and
other East European countries [on Russia's border, as well as in naval
maneuvers]{.underline} in the Black Sea [near Russia's sensitive naval
base]{.underline} at Sevastopol. [Washington]{.underline} has [even sent
U.S. troops]{.underline} as participants [in joint military exercises
with Ukrainian forces]{.underline}---an act that [Moscow considers
especially provocative, given its tense relations with Kiev. **On no
issue is the administration's risky course more evident than its
military policy toward Ukraine**]{.underline}. [Recent measures are
certain to provoke Moscow further, and entangle the United States to an
unwise extent with an extremely murky, ideologically troubling Ukrainian
regime.]{.underline} Secretary of Defense James Mattis acknowledges that
[U.S. instructors are training Ukrainian military units at a base in
western Ukraine]{.underline}. [Washington]{.underline} also has
[approved two important arms sales to Kiev's ground forces in just the
past nine months.]{.underline} The first transaction in December 2017
was limited to small arms that at least could be portrayed as purely
defensive weapons. That agreement included the export of Model M107A1
Sniper Systems, ammunition, and associated parts and accessories, a sale
valued at \$41.5 million. A transaction in [April 2018 was more
serious.]{.underline} [Not only was it larger]{.underline} (\$47
million), [it included far more lethal weaponry, particularly 210
Javelin anti-tank missiles]{.underline}---the kind of weapons that
Barack Obama's administration had declined to give Kiev. Needless to
say, [the Kremlin was not pleased about either sale]{.underline}.
Moreover, [Congress soon passed legislation]{.underline} in May [that
authorized \$250 million in military assistance, including lethal
weaponry, to Ukraine in 2019]{.underline}. Congress had twice voted for
military support on a similar scale during the last years of Obama's
administration, but the White House blocked implementation. The Trump
administration cleared that obstacle out of the way in December 2017 at
the same time that it approved the initial small-weapons sale. The
passage of the May 2018 legislation means that the path is now open for
a dramatic escalation of U.S. military backing for Kiev. On September 1,
[former U.S. Ambassador to NATO]{.underline} Kurt [Volker]{.underline}
[disclosed]{.underline} during an interview with The Guardian that
Washington's future military aid to Kiev would likely involve weapons
sales to Ukraine's air force and navy as well as the army. "[The
Javelins are mainly symbolic]{.underline} and it's not clear if they
would ever be used," Aric Toler, a research scholar at the Atlantic
Council, asserted. One could well dispute his sanguine conclusion, but
even Toler conceded: "Support for the Ukrainian navy and air defence
would be a big deal. That would be far more significant." [Volker's
cavalier attitude about U.S. arms sales to a government locked in a
crisis with Russia epitomizes the arrogance and tone-deaf nature of the
views that too many U.S. foreign policy officials exhibit regarding the
sensitive Ukraine issue]{.underline}. "We can have a conversation with
Ukraine like we would with any other country about what do they need. I
think that there's going to be some discussion about naval capability
because as you know their navy was basically taken by Russia \[when the
Soviet Union dissolved\]. And so they need to rebuild a navy and they
have very limited air capability as well. I think we'll have to look at
air defence." One suspects that **[Americans would be incensed at
comparable actions by Moscow]{.underline}** if the geo-strategic
situations were reversed. Imagine if Russia (even a democratic Russia)
had emerged from the wreckage of the Cold War as the undisputed global
superpower, and a weakened United States had to watch as the Kremlin
expanded a powerful, Russian-led military alliance to America's borders,
conducted alliance war games within sight of U.S. territory, interfered
in Canada's internal political affairs to oust a democratically elected
pro-American government, and then pursued growing military ties with the
new, anti-U.S. government in Ottawa. Yet that would be disturbingly
similar to what Washington has done regarding NATO policy and U.S.
relations with Ukraine. Moreover, [although Kiev's cheerleaders in
the]{.underline} Western (especially [U.S.]{.underline}) [media like to
portray Ukraine as a beleaguered democracy that plays the role of David
to Russia's evil Goliath, the reality is far murkier.]{.underline}
Putin's government overstates matters when it alleges that Ukraine's
2014 Maidan revolution was a U.S.-orchestrated coup that brought
outright fascists to power in Kiev. Nevertheless, that version contains
more than a little truth. Prominent, powerful U.S. figures, most notably
the late Senator John McCain and Assistant Secretary of State for
European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, openly sided with
demonstrators seeking to unseat Ukraine's elected government. Indeed,
Nuland was caught on tape with U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt
scheming about the desired composition of a new government in Kiev. It
is unfair to portray Ukraine's current administration led by President
Petro Poroshenko as a neo-fascist regime. Post-revolution elections
appear to have been reasonably free and fair, and there are major
factions that are committed to genuine democratic values. But
[Ukraine]{.underline} also [is hardly a model of Western-style
democracy]{.underline}. [Not only]{.underline} [is it afflicted with
extensive graft and corruption]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} some
[extreme nationalist and even neo-Nazi groups play a significant role in
the "new" Ukraine.]{.underline} The notoriously fascist Azov Battalion,
for example, continues to occupy a prominent position in Kiev's efforts
to defeat separatists in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region. Alexander
Zakharchenko, prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's
Republic in the pro-Russia rebel-occupied city of Donetsk, was
assassinated on September 1 and officials there and in Russia are
blaming Kiev. The Ukrainian government has denied involvement. [Other
ultranationalist factions act as domestic militias that attempt to
intimidate more moderate Ukrainians]{.underline}. Even the Poroshenko
government itself has adopted troubling censorship measures and other
autocratic policies. [Officials in both the Obama and Trump
administration have taken a much too casual attitude toward U.S.
cooperation with extremist elements and a deeply flawed Ukrainian
government.]{.underline} B[oth the danger of stoking tensions with
Moscow and becoming too close to a regime in Kiev that exhibits
disturbing features should caution the Trump administration against
boosting military aid to Ukraine]{.underline}. It is an unwise policy on
strategic as well as moral grounds. [Trump administration officials
should refuse to be intimidated or stampeded into forging a risky and
unsavory alliance with Kiev out of fear of being portrayed as
excessively "soft]{.underline}" toward Russia. Instead, the president
and his advisers need to spurn efforts to increase U.S. support for
Ukraine. **[A good place to start would be to restore the Obama
administration's refusal to approve arms sales to Kiev]{.underline}**.
[Washington must not pour gasoline on a geo-strategic fire that could
lead to a full-blown crisis between the United States and
Russia.]{.underline}

### 2ac -- AT -- Missiles

#### Increased missile sales cause Russian and Ukrainian aggression

**Davis 2018**

March 14, 2018 Daniel L. Davis senior fellow for Defense Priorities and
a former lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army "What Does America Gain by
Arming Ukraine?"
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-skeptics/what-does-america-gain-by-arming-ukraine-24901>

On March 1, the State Department authorized the sale of 210 Javelin
anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, applauded the sale because she said it
shows the United States is "serious about protecting the interests of
our nation," and will help Kiev "push back against growing Russian
aggression." It is more likely, however, that this sale will accomplish
the opposite.

The official press release from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA) in regards to the sale claimed that the weapons "will contribute
to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by
improving the security of Ukraine." Yet it is no small distinction to
point out that [Ukraine is not an ally of the United
States]{.underline}, and [we must question why improving their security
is worth degrading our relations with a nuclear-armed
Russia.]{.underline}

A military alliance is a commitment to another party that we will
sacrifice American sons and daughters for their benefit. To make such a
significant sacrifice, there must be a vital national interest at stake
for America. As important, entering into an alliance requires that the
other side be willing to sacrifice for our security, and that the ties
result in a benefit to the United States. None of those factors exist in
this case. [The benefit is all to Kiev]{.underline}---[and America
absorbs risk without the potential for reward]{.underline}.

[Not only will the sale of lethal arms]{.underline} [**not materially
help Ukraine**, but also it will likely increase Russian and separatist
opposition, worsening the situation. A change in the methodology of how
the government engages internationally is needed.]{.underline}

Whether in Ukraine or another international engagement, if an honest
analysis reveals that the United States has merely a secondary or
tertiary interest---rather than a core national interest---yet commits
itself to expending valuable political or military capital, the chances
are high that such engagement would end up costing more than would be
gained. Why should Washington spend money and risk the lives of our
troops for a mission that would leave the country at a net loss?

[In the current standoff in]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline},
[Washington]{.underline} [would certainly prefer to see a peaceful
resolution to the violence]{.underline}. [For Moscow and Kiev,
however]{.underline}, **[the matter is existential]{.underline}**,
[meaning each is willing to expend considerable capital]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[take significant risks]{.underline}** [to resolve
the conflict in their favor]{.underline}.

The 210 [anti-tank missiles]{.underline} [the State Department
authorized]{.underline} is enough to equip four or five mechanized or
infantry battalions for a short period of time. These missiles could
[provide a momentary tactical advantage, but strategically, the quantity
is **insufficient to tilt the balance of power**]{.underline} with
Russia and its allied forces.

In the latter stages of the Cold War, I was an officer in the 2nd
Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (2-2 ACR), a heavily armored unit
composed of large numbers of tanks and armored infantry carriers. In
1991, 2-2 ACR was sent to Iraq to fight Saddam Hussein's armored
divisions, which had invaded Kuwait. At the Battle of 73 Easting, my
squadron (a battalion-sized armored unit), fought against a brigade of
an Iraqi armored division.

During that battle, three cavalry troops of 2nd ACR---approximately the
size of one mechanized battalion---fired 125 tank rounds and eighty
anti-tank missiles. In the span of less than six hours, one
battalion-sized unit fired the equivalent of 38 percent of the entire
missile sale to Ukraine.

Thus, [no matter how it is billed in Washington]{.underline}, [this sale
will not "push back" against Russian aggression]{.underline}, nor is it
in the "interests of our nation." But [while sending these missiles
isn't enough to tip the military balance in Ukraine, it is more than
enough to]{.underline} **[convince Russia to increase its
involvement.]{.underline}**

[Those missiles represent a clear increase in the risk to Russia and
their proxy forces within eastern Ukraine because it **signals that
Washington** may be willing to provide **even greater lethal
support**]{.underline} to their opponent. [It is therefore likely Moscow
will take stronger action to counter the threat to **discourage** even
**greater American engagement**]{.underline}.

This support could take the form of Putin sending more armor, anti-armor
missiles of his own, more unofficial Russian troops, greater
intelligence support for allied forces, or some other response that
brings more violence and destruction to the Donbas region---the people
we're ostensibly trying to help.

It is reasonable and appropriate for the United States to promote the
good of others abroad and to champion our values as an exemplar, a
shining city on a hill. But we should only use, or threaten to use,
military power when American security, economic prosperity, or our way
of life are directly threatened.

Washington's intention with the missile sale may be to increase the pain
felt by Putin to drive him to a negotiated settlement, but the actual
result will almost certainly be a further militarization of the
situation and an increase in the potential for an expansion of the
conflict. Far from improving American security, this sale will undermine
it. Far from protecting Ukrainians, sending these missiles will place
them at increasing risk.

### 2ac - AT -- Expansionism

#### No Narvan aggression -- Estonia is a distinct adversary

**Kasekam 2015**

Andres Kasekam director of the Estonian Foreign Policy Institute and
Professor of Baltic Politics at the University of Tartu, Estonia. Andres
Kasekamp served as Chairman of the Board of the Open Estonia Foundation
"Why Narva is not next" Estonian Foreign Policy Institute Paper Series
no. 21 May 2015 https://www.digar.ee/arhiiv/et/download/248844

[Since the annexation of Crimea]{.underline}, [the question of whether
\"Narva is next]{.underline}?\" [has been on analysts\'
lips]{.underline}. [The international media has descended on Narva to
ask whether \"little green men\" could suddenly appear
there]{.underline}.i A border town 150 km from St. Petersburg with an
overwhelmingly Russian-speaking population, Narva is a symbol for the
larger Baltic question and the future of NATO. A chorus of prominent
analysts and public figures, including the former NATO Secretary-General
Anders Fogh Rasmussen, have warned of the \"high probability\" of future
Russian action against the Baltic states.ii

Indeed, the evidence of increasing military activity in the Baltic Sea
region as a spillover from the Ukrainain crisis is abundant. Russian air
force planes have been flying dangerously with transponders switched
off, and Russian warships have made their presence felt. In response,
NATO has beefed-up its air policing mission and increased troop
deployment for exercises to reassure the Baltic states and deter
Russia.iii [Though at first glance there might be some superficial
similarities]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [the Ukrainian
case]{.underline}, **[the differences are clearly more
significant]{.underline}**. First of all, the [Baltic]{.underline}
[states]{.underline} [are members of NATO and the EU]{.underline}, [and
thus Russian action]{.underline} against them [would]{.underline}
[have]{.underline} **[immeasurably graver consequences]{.underline}**.

The [success]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [the Crimean]{.underline}
[operation]{.underline} [depended on surprise]{.underline}. Few expected
or planned for Ukraine being militarily attacked by Russia. Russian
preparations were not detected (or at least correctly understood).
Russia was able to use its military bases already existing on Ukrainian
territory. Top Ukrainian commanders defected to the Russian side.
Russian actions exploited a unique post-revolutionary situation with
confusion about the legitimacy of interim authorities in Kyiv. The
border with Russia in eastern Ukraine was lengthy, porous, and weakly
guarded.

[In contrast to Ukraine]{.underline}, **[Estonia has a state capacity to
respond immediately.]{.underline}** [Estonia]{.underline} [is a
well-governed state]{.underline} [and **one of the least corrupt** in
Europe]{.underline}. [The fact]{.underline} the [Ukrainian forces did
not open fire]{.underline} in Crimea [encouraged]{.underline}
[Putin]{.underline} [to believe]{.underline} that [the same could be
easily accomplished in eastern Ukraine]{.underline}. However, when
Ukrainan forces resisted they succeeded in winning back territory until
Russian forces intervened directly. [Estonia]{.underline}
[capitulated]{.underline} meekly to the USSR [in 1940]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} vain [hope of not provoking
Moscow]{.underline}. [The lesson]{.underline} drawn [for contemporary
Estonian defence]{.underline} doctrine **[is to always offer military
resistance]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} [Commander of the Estonian
Defence Forces]{.underline} has [stated]{.underline} that [the first
\'little green man\' to appear on Estonian soil]{.underline} **[will be
shot immediately]{.underline}**.iv

Hybrid war is not something new for the Baltic states. They have already
experienced elements of hybrid war - cyber attacks, economic pressure,
disinformation campaigns. Even the Soviet-sponsored failed Communist
insurrection of 1924 in Estonia had many common features with events in
2014, as did the Soviet annexation in 1940. A key to Russian operations
in Ukraine has been deniability of direct military involvement. Thus the
separatists claim to have obtained their Russian arms and equipment from
overrun Ukrainian bases -- an impossiblity in Estonia since Estonian
forces use only NATO standard equipment.

[Putin does not consider Ukraine to be a genuine nation]{.underline},
but part of the larger Russian nation (and many Russians agree with
him). However, **[even Putin understands that Estonia]{.underline}**,
though small, [is **completely distinct.**]{.underline} There is **[no
historical territorial]{.underline}** bone of
**[contention]{.underline}**; [Narva has always indisputably belonged to
Estonia]{.underline}.

Perhaps the greatest concern has not been the military, but ethnic
factor. Putin has justified aggression against Ukraine with the need to
\'protect\' Russian speakers. This is a dangerous fallback to the
pre-1945 world, where dictators claimed the right to change borders by
force to bring co-ethnics into their fold. Putin\'s reasoning is a
dramatic escalation from the spurious excuse, used six years earlier in
South Ossetia, of protecting Russian citizens.

[Russophones in Ukraine]{.underline} [were]{.underline}
[swayed]{.underline} [by]{.underline} the [demonstration of
might]{.underline} [and a rational calculation]{.underline} to side with
the victor. [Material considerations]{.underline} also [played a
role]{.underline}; [for instance]{.underline}, [pensions are higher in
Russia]{.underline} than in Ukraine. Such **[incentives do not apply in
the Baltic case]{.underline}** [since]{.underline} [the standard of
living]{.underline} [is higher]{.underline} than in Russia. [This
is]{.underline} especially [evident in]{.underline} the [border
areas]{.underline}. The Pskov oblast bordering Estonia and Latvia is one
of the poorest in the entire Russian Federation. [People in
Narva]{.underline} regularly cross the bridge to Ivangorod and
[know]{.underline} very well for themselves that [life is more miserable
on the Russian side]{.underline} of the border. Narva\'s supermarkets
became a popular destination for consumers from St. Petersburg after
Putin slapped countersanctions on EU agricultural produce. Wages are
lower and unemployment higher than in Tallinn, but Narva\'s economic
indicators are similar to those of other peripheral Estonian towns.

While most Estonian russophones support the annexation of Crimea, it
would be wrong to jump to the conclusion that they would desire similar
Russian intervention at home. Indeed, the images of [carnage
in]{.underline} [eastern Ukraine are a powerful argument in favor of
maintaining peace]{.underline}. Rather than asking residents their
opinion about Crimea or Putin, it would be more insightful to ask
whether they would prefer rubles to euros or the Russian healthcare
system to the Estonian one. Even those Estonian russophones who are
non-citizens enjoy the right to freely travel and work within the EU, a
privilege that would be sorely missed. [Although there is]{.underline} a
sharp [contrast]{.underline} [between Estonian and Russian-speakers on
support for NATO]{.underline} [and perception of a threat from
Moscow]{.underline}, more importantly, **[there is little difference
regarding the will to defend their country]{.underline}**.v

Previously, it was believed that the integration of the Russian minority
would be resolved by time - Soviet nostalgia would fade with the passing
of the older generation. The first warning that this assumption was
false came with the conflict over the relocation of the Tallinn Soviet
war monument (\"the Bronze soldier\") in 2007. Russia has
instrumentalized its "compatriots" in order to undermine societal
integration and to maintain a sense of greivence and marginalization.
The conflict in Ukraine has been accompanied by an unprecendented level
and sophistication of hostile information warfare. Most Estonians and
Russphones live in separate information spaces, with Russian TV being
the prime source for the latter. The Baltic states were among those who
proposed that the EU take countermeasures to combat Russian media
falsifictions. The Estonia government has decided to fund a new Russian
language TV channel -- not to provide counter-propaganda, but to
strengthen the identity of the local community.

[Some]{.underline} [analysts have argued]{.underline} that [it is not
important what people in Narva]{.underline} actually
[think]{.underline}, [because Russia could ignite trouble]{.underline}
simply [by inserting]{.underline} a few [outsiders]{.underline}. [A
related question is whether NATO allies would]{.underline} be willing to
"[die for Narva]{.underline}?"vi [The]{.underline} [logic]{.underline}
[of this]{.underline} hypothetical argument [is that
Putin\'s]{.underline} [ultimate aim is not territorial
expansion]{.underline}, [but dividing the]{.underline} [West by
undermining NATO and the EU.]{.underline} An operation limited to Narva
could leave NATO in a dilemma of how to respond, especially since the
new Russian military doctrine foresees the \'de-escalation\' of
conflicts by nuclear means, i.e. threatening to carry out a limited
tactical number strike in order to convince NATO to refrain from coming
to the assistance of an ally under attack. Andrei Piontkovsky has
[turn]{.underline}ed [the question around and ask]{.underline}ed
[whether]{.underline} [Putin is willing to die for
Narva]{.underline}.vii **[Such a gamble obviously wouldn\'t be
worth]{.underline}** it, but Putin has demonstrated that he is much less
risk-averse than Western leaders. Visiting Tallinn in September 2014, US
President [Obama]{.underline} [stated]{.underline} that the "the
[defense of Tallinn and Riga and Vilnius is just as important as the
defense of Berlin and Paris and London]{.underline}."viii In order for
the validity of this statement not to be tested, [deterrence must

report issued by three U.S.-based think tanks in support of the
provision of lethal arms to Ukraine, it recommends that U.S. weapons and
military equipment should go to the "Ukrainian Army only." One of the
reasons for the above-mentioned requirement is the fighting methods of
the **[Aydar and Azov]{.underline}** volunteer battalions, which have
been strongly criticized by [United

battalions, known among civilians as the ["punitive

[**are accused of various crimes including** "abductions, unlawful

[executions."]{.underline} In addition, the Azov battalion decorates
their uniform with [Nazi
insignia](http://www.haaretz.com/news/world/1.614913) as exposed by
Norwegian and German TV reporters. While **[the United States may
require that no U.S. weapons reach these battalions, this requirement
may prove difficult in practice]{.underline}**. According to [Ukrainian
law](http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/876-18), many of the volunteer
battalions are now an official part of the National Guard of Ukraine,
which is a part of the Ukrainian armed forces, even though some of the
battalions still often pursue their own agenda. [Ukrainian news
sources](http://www.kyivpost.com/media/images/2014/09/09/p191cv8n0e7mi76g18r81ijf1sfu4/original.png)
have indicated that the total number of volunteers is [approximately
7,000](http://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/why-sending-weapons-to-ukraine-would-be-terrible-idea-for-the-us),
subdivided into more than 40 different battalions. Compared to the
earlier stages of the current conflict in Ukraine, **[the cooperation
between the volunteers and the Ukrainian Army is now much stronger, and
they are often fighting side-by-side on the battlefield.]{.underline}**
There are numerous accounts of the battalions Aydar, Azov,
[Donbas](http://www.romea.cz/en/news/world/ukraine-neo-nazis-from-right-sector-form-donbas-battalion-to-handle-pro-russian-separatists)

Army](http://observers.france24.com/content/20140710-video-shows-ultra-nationalist-militants-fighting-alongside-ukraine%D5-army-restive-ea).

Furthermore, the **[Ukrainian government recently supplied the Azov
brigade with military equipment]{.underline}**, including [armored
vehicles with
weapons.](http://ukraine.setimes.com/en_GB/articles/uwi/features/2015/01/15/feature-01)
Although the Poroshenko administration is concerned about the abuses of
some of these volunteers and dozens of criminal cases were opened
against the Aydar battalion alone, the administration [has been
reluctant to address the
concern](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-rise-of-warlords-threatens-ukraines-recovery/2014/12/30/a23b2d36-8f7b-11e4-a412-4b735edc7175_story.html).
**[The administration's unwillingness to act may be in part because
these volunteers have strong support from certain senior government
officials]{.underline}** such as Arsen Avakov, the head of the Ministry
of Interior. Last September, for instance, Avakov named an Azov
volunteer as the head of the Kiev police. **[A Ukrainian governor in
eastern Ukraine]{.underline}**, Ihor Kolomoyskyy, **[is also financing
some of these brigades and [allowing them to flout Ukrainian

As the Obama Administration continues to determine whether it makes
sense to supply Ukraine with lethal aid]{.underline}**, it is important
to look beyond the potential Russian reaction alone in such a public
debate. **[Both the high level of corruption within the Ukrainian
military and the continued support of problematic volunteer brigades
poses clear risks to the loss, resale or misuse of U.S. weapons and
military equipment]{.underline}**, potentially harming innocent
civilians. It will be critical for the United States to fully understand
these risks to protect U.S. interests

is the direct result of U.S. government policy toward

Ukrainian nationalists linked to the country's Social-National Party,
Azov Battalion [has since become
incorporated](https://www.rt.com/news/439192-azov-battalion-memorial-lichtdom/)
into Ukraine's Interior Ministry as a component of the country's
National Guard. In addition, the group's founder Andrey Bilitsky, is
currently a member of Ukraine's parliament. Bilitsky [once
said](https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-america-training-neonazis-in-ukraine)that
"The historic mission of our nation in this critical moment is to lead
the White Races of the world in a final crusade for their survival."
Despite the merging of Azov Battalion with the Ukrainian government,
**[the U.S has long continued to support Ukraine's military
with]{.underline}** **[[hundreds of millions of
dollars](https://www.thenation.com/article/congress-has-removed-a-ban-on-funding-neo-nazis-from-its-year-end-spending-bill/)
in "security, programmatic, and technical assistance,]{.underline}**"
largely in the name of combatting "Russian aggression." **[This military
aid has repeatedly found its way to the Azov Battalion]{.underline}**.
Indeed, the cooperation between the U.S. military and Azov Battalion has
been reported on several occasions since 2015 such as when an Azov
Battalion member [told the Daily

earlier this year. However, Azov Battalion continues to receive arms
from U.S. allies such as Israel. As journalist Max Blumenthal [has
noted](https://therealnews.com/stories/israel-is-arming-ukraines-blatantly-neo-nazi-militia-the-azov-battalion)
in the past, Israel has a "history of working as a kind of proxy for the

fascistic."

Shameful as the civilian actions are, conduct on the battlefield is
truly of critical importance. The war is being fought in eastern
Ukraine, which is more rural and, where people are fewer and farther
between, atrocities can occur without as many witnesses: According to
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Special
Monitoring Mission, as of October, at least 212 civilians were injured
or killed in 2018, mostly from shelling and light weapons
[fire](https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2019/country-chapters/ukraine)."
Aside from deaths and injuries, people's homes and livelihoods are at
stake and victims are at risk for everything from PTSD to extreme
poverty. HRW cataloged the damage: Shelling across or near the contact
line separating the two sides continued to damage civilian homes and
infrastructure and to threaten civilian lives. Since 2014, 740 education
facilities were damaged during the conflict, 16 from January to October
2018. Both sides carried out indiscriminate or deliberate attacks on
schools and used them for military purposes." **[The sheer number of
schools that have fallen prey to this war is something on the order of
what is seen in some African countries]{.underline}**, certainly not in
Europe, **[and is indicative of a failed state]{.underline}**. **[It's
often fascists who rise to prominence in failed states. They are able to
capitalize on anarchy and promise to restore order. Ukraine is certainly

killed scores of protestors and policemen on Kiev's Maidan Square in
February 2014, thereby triggering a "democratic revolution" that
overthrew the elected president, Viktor Yanukovych, and brought to power

but instead almost certainly by the Neofascist organization Right Sector
and its co-conspirators." The United States government hasn't sent just
money and weapons to the Ukranian frontline. Washington has sent troops
to carry out war games very near the Russian border and Russia's Naval
Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. This was timed specifically before

Carpenter covers different arms deals with Ukraine, which is the situs
of a hot-proxy war with Russia and has nothing to do with democracy: The
first transaction in December 2017 was limited to small arms ...Model
M107A1 Sniper Systems, ammunition, and associated parts and accessories,
a sale valued at \$41.5 million. A transaction in April 2018 was more
serious. Not only was it larger (\$47 million), it included...210

uprising as a triumph of democracy, but

his neo-Nazi background is ignored or outright denied. Even more

not just the military and street gangs: Ukraine's far right has

to deny their heroism. The OUN had
[collaborated](https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2010/02/24/a-fascist-hero-in-democratic-kiev/)
with the Nazis and participated in the Holocaust, while the UPA
slaughtered thousands of Jews and 70,000-100,000 Poles on their own
volition. The government-funded [Ukrainian Institute of National
Memory](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-ukraines-new-memory-commissar-is-controlling-the-nations-past/)
is institutionalizing the
[whitewashing](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/02/the-historian-whitewashing-ukraines-past-volodymyr-viatrovych/)
of Nazi collaborators. Last summer, the Ukrainian parliament featured an

commemorating the OUN's 1941 proclamation of cooperation with the Third
Reich (imagine the French government installing an exhibit celebrating
the Vichy state!). Torchlight marches in honor of OUN/UPA leaders like
[Roman

in eastern Ukraine. Predictably, the celebration of Nazi collaborators
has accompanied a rise in outright anti-Semitism. "[Jews

organizations largely refrained from criticizing Ukraine, perhaps in the
hope Kiev would address the issue on its own. But by 2018, the
increasing frequency of anti-Semitic incidents led Jewish groups to
break their silence. Last year, the Israeli government's annual
[report](https://www.jta.org/2018/01/28/israel/report-ukraine-had-more-anti-semitic-incidents-than-all-former-soviet-countries-combined)

speaking out. In 2017, the director of one of Ukraine's largest Jewish

Ukrainian Jewish leaders supported the Maidan uprising. None of these
concerns have been addressed in any meaningful way. ROMA POGROMS "'They

Ukraine is extraordinarily multilingual: In addition to the millions of
Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainians, there are areas where Hungarian,
Romanian, and other tongues are prevalent. These languages were
protected by a 2012 regional-language law. The post-Maidan government

the 2012 regional language law---the one Kerry promised eastern
Ukrainians would stay in effect. Currently, Kiev is preparing to pass a
[draconian](https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/70098) law that
would mandate the use of Ukrainian in most aspects of public life. It's
another example of Kiev alienating millions of its own citizens, while
claiming to embrace Western values. These examples are only a tiny
fraction of Ukraine's slide toward intolerance, but they should be
enough to point out the obvious: **[Washington's decision to ignore the
proliferation of armed neo-Nazi groups in a highly unstable nation only
led to them gaining more power]{.underline}**. This easily predictable
outcome is in marked contrast to Washington's enthusiasm over the
"Revolution of Dignity." "[Nationalism is exactly what Ukraine
needs](https://www.anneapplebaum.com/2014/05/12/nationalism-is-exactly-what-ukraine-needs/),"
proclaimed a New Republic article by historian Anne Applebaum, whose
celebration of nationalism came out right around the time that Ukraine
green-lighted the formation of white-supremacist paramilitaries. A mere
four months after Applebaum's essay, Newsweek ran an article titled
"Ukrainian nationalist volunteers committing 'ISIS-style' war crimes."

the influence of Ukraine's far right. (Curiously, the same analysts

as highly dangerous.) Perhaps think-tankers deluded themselves into
thinking Kiev's far-right phase would tucker itself out. More likely,
they simply embraced DC's go-to strategy of "my enemy's enemy is my
friend." Either way, **[the ramifications stretch far beyond
Ukraine]{.underline}**. America's backing of the Maidan uprising, along
with the billions DC sinks into post-Maidan Kiev, make it clear:

### Internal -- Ukraine Exports Fascism Globally

#### Azov recruitment and weapons are key to exporting fascism globally

\*Recruitment internal

\*Legitimacy internal

\*Mentions arms

**Miller 18** ([Christopher
Miller](https://www.rferl.org/author/98603.html), correspondent based in
Kyiv who covers the former Soviet republics for Radio Free Europe,
NOVEMBER 14, 2018. Azov, Ukraine\'s Most Prominent Ultranationalist
Group, Sets Its Sights On U.S., Europe,
<https://www.rferl.org/a/azov-ukraine-s-most-prominent-ultranationalist-group-sets-its-sights-on-u-s-europe/29600564.html>

For the Ukrainians, too, the benefits extended outside the ring. **[It
marked a step toward legitimizing Azov among its counterparts in the
West and set in motion what appears to be its next project: the
expansion of its movement abroad. \"We think globally,\"]{.underline}**
Olena Semenyaka, the international secretary for Azov\'s political wing,
the National Corps, told RFE/RL in an interview at one of the group\'s
Kyiv offices last week. The Rundo fight has received fresh scrutiny
following an FBI criminal complaint against him unsealed last month that
preceded his arrest. In it, Special Agent Scott Bierwirth wrote that
Azov\'s military wing is \"believed to have participated in training and
radicalizing United States-based white supremacy organizations.\"
**[Washington has armed Ukraine with Javelin antitank missile systems
and trained its armed forces as they fight Russia-backed separatists in
the east.]{.underline}** But it has banned arms from going to Azov
members and forbidden them from participating in U.S.-led military
training because of their far-right ideology. It was Azov\'s Semenyaka
who hosted Rundo along with fellow Americans Michael Miselis and
Benjamin Daley, RAM members who participated in last year\'s \"Unite The
Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that was the backdrop for
the death of 32-year-old counterprotester Heather Heyer. This month, in
Kyiv, she hosted and translated for American Greg Johnson, a white
nationalist who edits the website Counter-Currents, which the Southern
Poverty Law Center describes as \"an epicenter of 'academic\' white
nationalism.\" Over the past year, she\'s made several outreach trips to
Western Europe to meet with far-right groups and spread Azov\'s
ultranationalist message. And when she\'s not doing it herself,
Semenyaka said, that task is sometimes given to Denis Nikitin, a
prominent Russian soccer hooligan and MMA fighter who founded the white
nationalist clothing label White Rex and has a garnered a large
following across Europe and the United States. In November 2017, the two
traveled together to Warsaw and participated in the Europe Of The Future
2 conference organized by Polish white supremacist group and \"ally\"
Szturmowcy (Stormtroopers), where they were meant to speak alongside
American Richard Spencer, Semenyaka said. But Polish authorities barred
Spencer from entering the country and he was unable to attend. Often in
Kyiv when he\'s not traveling through Europe or visiting family in
Germany, Nikitin operates as a sort of unofficial Azov
ambassador-at-large and organizes MMA bouts at the Reconquista Club, the
ultranationalist haunt where Rundo fought. A combination restaurant,
sports center, and fight club, Semenyaka said Rundo and Nikitin met
there and \"exchanged ideas.\" **[In the current climate, with an
apparent shift toward nationalism in parts of Europe, \"it\'s possible
for far-right leaders to come to power now and \-- we hope \-- form a
coalition]{.underline}**,\" Semenyaka told RFE/RL. And
**[Azov]{.underline}**, she added, \"**[wants a position at the front of
this movement]{.underline}**.\" From Battlefield To Political Arena The
Azov Battalion was formed in May 2014 in response to the Russia-backed
separatist advance sweeping across eastern Ukraine. Comprised of
volunteers, it has roots in a group of hard-core, far-right soccer fans,
including many violent hooligans, commonly known in Eastern Europe as
\"ultras.\" With Ukraine\'s weak military at the time caught
flat-footed, Azov and other such battalions did much of the heavy
fighting in the early days of the war, which has killed more than 10,300
people. But it was Azov that attracted those of far-right persuasion,
including at least three Americans and many others from Western nations.
One such fighter was Mikael Skillt, a Swede who trained as a sniper in
the Swedish Army and previously described himself as an \"ethnic
nationalist.\" The Azov Battalion flaunts a symbol similar to that of
the former Nazi Wolfsangel. (The group claims it is an amalgam of the
letters N and I for \"national idea.\") [It has been
accused](https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UA/Ukraine_14th_HRMMU_Report.pdf)
by international human rights groups, such as the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), of committing and
allowing serious human rights abuses, including torture. Following a
2015 deal known as the Minsk Accords that was meant to be a road map to
end the fighting but did little more than turn down the intensity, the
Azov Battalion was officially incorporated into Ukraine\'s National
Guard and its leadership shifted focus from the battlefield to the
political arena. The Azov National Corps entered the political fray in
October 2016, appointing battalion commander Andriy Biletsky to lead it.
Biletsky was previously tied to other far-right groups and, in 2010,
[reportedly
said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/13/ukraine-far-right-national-militia-takes-law-into-own-hands-neo-nazi-links)
that the nation\'s mission was to \"lead the white races of the world in
a final crusade\...against Semite-led Untermenschen \[subhumans\].\" The
party incorporated two other far-right organizations, including Patriot
of Ukraine, which [according to the Kharkiv Human Rights
Group](http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1517275970) \"espoused xenophobic
and neo-Nazi ideas and was engaged in violent attacks against migrants,
foreign students in Kharkiv, and those opposing its views.\" [As RFE/RL
reported at the
time](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-nationalists-torchlight-march-azov-party/28053936.html),
the National Corps\' inaugural ceremony arguably had pomp more
reminiscent of 1930s Germany than of postwar democracy. It included
nationalist chants, raised fists, and a torchlit march through central
Kyiv. In January, in another flashy ceremony, Azov introduced a new
paramilitary force that it calls the National Militia. On a snowy
evening, some 600 of mostly young men in matching fatigues [marched from
Kyiv\'s central Independence
Square](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-azov-right-wing-militia-to-patrol-kyiv/29008036.html)
to a lighted fortress on a hillside in the Ukrainian capital, where they
swore an oath to clean the streets of illegal alcohol, drug traffickers,
and illegal gambling establishments. While not officially part of the
Ukrainian Interior Ministry or any other government body legally
authorized to enforce the law, the National Militia has more often than
not been allowed to establish what it considers \"Ukrainian order\" on
the streets of cities across the country. In many cases, that has meant
attacking LGBT events and Romany camps, actions for which members of the
group have not been prosecuted. Combined, these groups are known as the
\"Azov movement,\" which includes more than 10,000 active members,
according to Semenyaka. \'State Within The State\' But Azov\'s success
in growing the movement so far has not translated into much political
success at home. While the party has not yet been tested in
parliamentary elections, less than 1 percent of eligible voters said
they would vote for National Corps or its fellow far-right group Right
Sector, according to June polling by Kyiv-based Razumkov Center. Those
groups didn\'t fare much better in July, when GFK Ukraine asked whether
voters would support an alliance of National Corps, Right Sector, and a
third far-right party, Svoboda, and only 2 percent responded positively.
At the same time, however, **[Azov]{.underline}** believes its
**[influence has grown]{.underline}**. [In an October 29 post on
Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/olena.semenyaka/posts/2193069517369915?__tn__=H-R),
Semenyaka went so far as to say that \"just within 4 years, the Azov
Movement has become a small state in the state.\" **[Much of the success
has come from recruiting new]{.underline}**, mostly young, **[members,
who it hopes will come to the polls in next year\'s parliamentary
elections. [Azov has done so with youth
camps](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-azov-regiment-military/27355932.html)]{.underline}**,
including some that teach children as young as 9 years old military
tactics and far-right ideology, recreation centers, lecture halls, and
far-right education programs. It has also utilized the reach of social
media, particularly Facebook and Telegram, where the group recruits and
promotes patriotism, nationalism, and a sport-focused lifestyle. Much of
that effort caters to Ukrainians coming of age in a time of war and as
illiberal governments rise on the country\'s periphery, said Ukrainian
sociologist Anya Hrytsenko, who researches far-right groups. \"**[Azov
has made far-right nationalism fashionable]{.underline}**, and they have
been strategic in how they portray themselves, shedding the typical
neo-Nazi trappings,\" Hrytsenko told RFE/RL. \"**[This has helped them
to move from a subculture to the mainstream.\"]{.underline}** Explaining
that strategy, Semenyaka, who has been photographed holding a flag with
a swastika and making a Nazi salute, said that \"more radical\" language
was used previously, such as during the height of the war in 2014, when
the Azov Battalion needed fighters, \"because it was required by the
situation.\" Now, she said, **[the strategy is to \"moderate\" in order
to appeal to a broader base in Ukraine and abroad]{.underline}**. But
only to an extent. \"We are trying to become mainstream without
compromising some of our core ideas,\" she continued, adding that
\"radical statements\...scare away more of society.\" And in its
recalibration, **[Azov is not only thinking of Ukrainians but of
like-minded groups abroad]{.underline}**. Hence the addition of members
like Semenyaka and collaboration with Nikitin, who literally speak the
language of their counterparts abroad \"Their English has gotten
better,\" Hrytsenko said, referring to Azov members behind the group\'s
Western outreach. Nikitin, who could not be reached for an interview, is
a Russian and German speaker. Another thing that has helped, Hrytsenko
noted, is that Ukraine\'s break from Russia and move toward the European
Union has allowed Ukrainians visa-free travel, making Azov\'s outreach
easier logistically. Making Friends In The West In recent months,
Semenyaka and other Azov members have taken advantage of that, making
several visits to EU countries to meet numerous European counterparts,
according to investigations by RFE/RL and the open-source investigative
group Bellingcat. Semenyaka participated in and [blogged
about](http://intermariumnc.org/?p=425) the Young Europe Forum in
Dresden in August alongside far-right sympathizers from groups in
Germany, Italy, and Austria. Specifically, she said she has met with
those from groups that Azov considers close allies \-- for instance,
Greece\'s Golden Dawn, Italy\'s CasaPound, Poland's Szturmowcy, and
Germany\'s National Democratic Party and Alternative For Germany. Other
Azov members have traveled to meet counterparts in Baltic states and
Croatia, she added. Besides speaking about their shared ideologies,
Semenyaka said, **[Azov members in some cases have \"shared experiences
in creating territorial defense forces,\" a reference to the groups
battalion and vigilante street units.]{.underline}** Asked about the FBI
allegations in the [criminal
complaint](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/421-robert-rundo-complaint/0f1e76cdeef814133f24/optimized/full.pdf)
first reported by The New York Times \-- that **[Azov was \"training and
radicalizing\" American far-right groups]{.underline}** \-- she said it
was not and dared U.S. authorities to \"provide real evidence of this.\"
In the case of Rundo, Miselis, and Daley, Semenyaka said, \"they came to
learn our ways\" and \"showed interest in learning how to create youth
forces in the ways Azov has.\" On the visit, the three Americans also
attended a concert by the white-nationalist metal band Sokyra Peruna,
[where concertgoers made Nazi salutes and waved Nazi
flags](http://zaborona.com/interactive/sokyra-peruna-gig/). They also
posed for photographs to promote Rundo\'s The Right Brand clothing line
at Kyiv\'s Independence Square, [joined Azov members at Kyiv\'s famous
outdoor
gym](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8RiXlmzN6w&fbclid=IwAR1Q3SYdfgvuyjYjrJRu-ESLAvuxXWJDTrWRbvAepFYZf8STfAWah4u8c9w),
Kachalka, for a weight-training session, and fought at the Reconquista
Club. Rundo even got White Rex's Viking warrior logo tattooed on his
left calf. \"But there was no military training,\" Semenyaka insisted.
Counter-Currents\' Johnson was perhaps the most recent American to ask
for Azov\'s help. In a rare public appearance, the alt-right ideologue
visited Kyiv at the invitation of Semenyaka to lecture on October 16
about his Manifesto Of White Nationalism. Semenyaka translated for
Johnson, who spoke to a small but crowded room at Azov\'s Plomin (Flame)
cultural center. [In a video of the
event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRkbiezOOWs) published on Azov\'s
Plomin YouTube channel, Johnson, whom the Southern Poverty Law Center
(SPLC)
[describes](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/greg-johnson)
as \"one of the leading voices of the far-right\" and \"an international
figure for white nationalism,\" doesn\'t hide his motive for the trip:
to learn from Ukraine\'s ultranationalists and their successes. \"This
is not a speaking tour, it\'s a listening tour. I really want to learn
how maybe we can do things better in the United States and Western
Europe,\" Johnson said, lamenting the state of the alt-right in the
United States. \"**[It was a very, very influential and powerful
movement for a very short time]{.underline}**,\" he said of America\'s
alt-right movement, without providing a precise time frame. \"**[And at
the peak of it, we had a network that extended all the way to the office
of the president]{.underline}**,\" he continued, in what appeared to be
a reference to Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and
alt-right figure. \"There were very few degrees of separation between
people who were making ideas\...and people who were in a position to
make political policy, and that was totally destroyed,\" Johnson added.
He praised Ukraine\'s far-right groups, who he said were capable of
\"real street activism.\" Associations Too Much For Some In Azov While
Azov\'s cooperation with groups like RAM has been largely welcomed by
the group\'s members, some have found it uncomfortable. Skillt, the
Swedish national who fought as a sniper in the Azov Battalion, is one of
them. \"I don\'t mind \[Azov\] reaching out, but the ones they reach out
to\... Jesus,\" he told RFE/RL, in an allusion to RAM. He added that he
had recently distanced himself from Azov because of that association and
others with far-right groups in Europe. Skillt, who runs a private
intelligence agency in Kyiv and said his clients \"really don\'t enjoy
bad company,\" argued that the group has made a mistake by not reaching
out more to right-wing conservatives who could help with \"influential
contacts in Europe \[so\] you don\'t get branded a neo-Nazi.\" But
Semenyaka described praise of Azov from foreign ultranationalist groups
who are increasingly welcoming it as evidence that the organization is
taking the right path. And she said it isn\'t about to let up. Next, she
said, **[Azov hopes to win over larger, more mainstream far-right and
populist Western political forces who \"can be our potential
sympathizers.\"]{.underline}** \"If crises like Brexit and the refugee
problem continue, in this case, **[partnerships with nationalist groups
in Europe can be a kind of platform for our entry into the European
Union]{.underline}**.\"

As the international secretary of Azov's National Corps, Olena
[Semanyaka has emerged as one of the most prolific publicists of Eastern
European fascism]{.underline}. With jet black hair and a faintly gothic
look, she brands herself as a "traditionalist," emulating her hero,
Julius Evola, the late Italian occultist philosopher who espoused a
"racism of the spirit." Though she has been photographed bearing a Nazi

[welcome guest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bcaJqH6XBg) on

Ukrainian nationalist activists held by Russia. In her role with Azov,
Semanyaka organizes conferences aimed at popularizing the concept of
"the great European Reconquista" --- a pan-European fascist-nationalist
takeover that begins in the former Soviet satellite states and
ultimately sweeps through Western Europe on the strength of
anti-foreigner resentment. Semanyaka [laid

**[In recent years there has been a groundswell of nationalism and
far-right extremism across Europe, allowing far-right political parties
to gain power]{.underline}** in several countries as well as
representation in the European Parliament. Today there are more than 59
nationalist parties, 15 regionalist parties, more than 60 active
nationalist-separatist movements, and a growing radical right-wing
extremist movements throughout the EU. Collectively, far-right
nationalist groups occupy 153 of 751 seats in the European Parliament
representing 21 of the 28 EU member states. This rise in nationalist
sentiment is the result of growing Euroscepticism that has been driven
in part by the Eurozone debt crisis, increased opposition to mass
immigration, fear of cultural liberalization, and the perceived
surrender of national sovereignty to external organizations. **[These
nationalist movements threaten the integrity of the EU, the future of
the NATO Alliance, and the overall security and stability of
Europe.]{.underline}** Leveraging nationalist sentiments, Russia is
waging a hybrid warfare campaign to achieve their own political
objectives by supporting nationalist opposition parties and far-right
extremist groups to increase Euroscepticism and ultimately create
disengagement among EU and NATO members. Today's **[nationalist
movements are gaining strength in part because they are creating large
networks of support across Europe. These movements have created
transnational alliances to support each other to oppose the
EU]{.underline}**. The Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF), Europe of
Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD or EFD2), and the European
Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) are nationalist Eurosceptic groups
made up of members from several EU members states that collectively have
significant representation in the European parliament. These group's
stated purpose is to work for freedom and co-operation among peoples of
different States to return power back to the people of sovereign states,
to focus on respect for Europe's history, traditions and cultural values
with the belief that peoples and Nations of Europe have the right to
protect their borders and strengthen their own historical, traditional,
religious and cultural values\[1\]. These groups are also committed to
sovereignty, democracy, freedom and ending mass immigration so that
members may advance their own interests at the domestic level\[2\].
**[The collective strength of these groups empower local nationalist
movements, enabling them to gain influence and power that might not
otherwise be possible]{.underline}**. As each individual nationalist
movement gains power, the larger alliance gains power to support other
movements. The rise of nationalist sentiments is also emboldening
right-wing extremism groups. While not all nationalist parties are
affiliated with right-wing extremism, the similarity in ideologies
creates sympathetic leanings that are destructive for society. In recent
years**[, right-wing political movements have brought together
coalitions of Neo-Nazis with mainstream free-market conservatives,
normalizing political ideologies]{.underline}**\[3\]. **[These
relationships can be used to serve mutually supportive
positions]{.underline}** while leaving room for plausible deniability.
These violent **[far-right groups have not only embraced similar
populist language of the nationalist political movements, they also
espouse openly racist epithets and employ violence to pursue their goals
of reestablishing ethnically homogenous states]{.underline}**\[4\]. Not
unlike the Nazi party of the past and consistent with nationalist
rhetoric, these groups portray immigrants and ethnic minorities as the
cause for economic troubles and demonize as threats to the broader
national identity\[5\]. In essence, **[nationalist parties benefit from
national fervor generated by these right-wing extremist without having
to openly support their violent activities]{.underline}**.

### Internal -- Far right terrorism escalates

#### Far-right extremism escalates -- goes biological & nuclear and causes government instability

\*CBRN = Chemical, biological, radiological & nuclear weapons

Even though only limited information was available on the ideological
motivation and background of individuals involved in far-right CBRN
terrorism, **[a strong indication emerged from the
dataset]{.underline}** that **[non-religious forms of far-right
ideology]{.underline}**, **[especially neoNazism and]{.underline}**
non-religious **[white supremacism, were the main driving forces behind
the incidents]{.underline}** (58 percent or 18 incidents of the
dataset). Hence, **[it was]{.underline}** not the notion of an
"apocalyptic racism" 59 that appears to have been an important goal of
far-right CBRN incidents, but rather **[the attempt to create chaos and
cause an uprising to topple the government; to force the authorities to
declare martial law causing public unrest and helping far-right groups
to take power]{.underline}**; to directly weaken law enforcement and the
government; or to destroy identified enemies. Widely held assumptions
that the risk of political blowback for non-religious terrorists when
associated with CBRN terrorism would act as a rational barrier against
these tactics have not been confirmed in the case of far-right CBRN
terrorism. This strongly supports studies arguing that **[the strategic
or pragmatic logic behind the choice of weapon outweighs potential
ideological repercussions]{.underline}**.60 This finding is furthermore
supported by the clear majority (also 61 percent or 19 cases) of
incidents which involve an attack or weapon design **[indiscriminately
attacking prospective victims]{.underline}**. This includes **[poisoning
the water supply]{.underline}** of large cities, **[detonating a "dirty
bomb]{.underline}**," **[or]{.underline}** pumping **[poisonous
gas]{.underline}** into ventilation systems of certain buildings. Even
though in some cases the target group was delineated (e.g., Jewish
community), the attack would not have made it possible to discriminate
between individuals or even small groups of people. Successful plans
would have resulted in indiscriminate casualties in the majority of
cases. It is unknown whether the perpetrators saw a risk of political
blowback, and a potential indication---the use of claiming and
communication after the successful attack---is not available for most of
the incidents, since they failed to come to fruition. It is known that
right-wing terrorists rarely claim their attacks,61 and **[a popular
strategy within the far-right calls for false flag
attacks]{.underline}** (the "strategy of tension") 62 **[to cause
populations to rally behind right-wing extremist parties and movements
for restoring law and order]{.underline}**. Without assessing the
communication behavior of perpetrators after an attack, we cannot be
sure what the communication strategy of far-right CBRN actors might have
been. Nevertheless, the fact that most attack plans were designed to
target indiscriminately indicates that the persons involved either saw
no ideological issue with that tactic or did not anticipate a
significant negative backlash on their own group or movement. On the
agents and complexity of plots Multiple different agents of chemical,
biological, or radiological origin were identified in the 31 incidents
of the dataset for this article. However, for some incidents conflicting
agents were listed in the analyzed sources, leaving only a vague idea of
the agents intended for use. Nevertheless, the majority of incidents (11
out of 31) involved ricin, followed by cyanide compounds (8 out of 31).
Both agents require only a low level of knowledge and equipment for
their acquisition and can thus be rated as agents of low complexity.
Cyanide compounds, such as sodium cyanide or potassium cyanide, are
required for a variety of chemical synthesis reactions and can therefore
be easily obtained.63 They are also ready for harmful application
"out-of-the-box." In contrast to these chemical compounds, ricin is a
toxic protein of biological origin. Ricin can be isolated from the beans
of the castor oil plant (Ricinus communis) using a small laboratory
setup in a plain household kitchen with makeshift extraction
equipment.64 The beans of the castor oil plant as well as the isolation
manuals can be acquired via the internet. However, due to the mixed
quality of source material and equipment used, the quality and purity of
ricin isolated within a makeshift laboratory setup might be
significantly low. Ricin must be taken up into the human body, e.g., by
injection, oral application, or inhalation, to exert high-level
toxicity.65 Since the production of ricin is laborious, it is unlikely
that sufficient quantities can be easily obtained to affect large
crowds, e.g., by aerosolization.66 Ricin is most likely to be used for
targeted assassinations, e.g., of governmental personnel, or an attack
on a confined space, such as a restaurant, e.g., by lacing bowls filled
with food or sauces with ricin. Ricin is also the most prominent agent
of biological origin identified in the incidents. Further toxins that
are generally considered as potential agents in bioterror attacks, such
as shigatoxin or staphylococcal enterotoxin,67were not identified in any
incident. However, these agents are also more difficult to acquire,
since they must be isolated and purified from bacterial cultures, while
ricin can be isolated in a simpler way from plain raw materials. Other
biological agents (such as botulinum toxin) were included in only a few
incidents. Additionally, bacterial strains were only considered as an
active agent in a handful of incidents (5 out of 31). Anthrax, which has
become synonymous with the spores of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis
and the toxin produced by the bacteria,68 was only identified in three
incidents. Anthrax is generally considered by the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) to be the agent most likely to be used in a large-scale
terror attack on the United States.69 It is therefore surprising that
the incident numbers are low, since anthrax would be advantageous for
several reasons. B. anthracisis an omnipresent soil dweller and can thus
be obtained from environmental samples by microbiological isolation
procedures.70 Also, while growing B. anthracis in a makeshift laboratory
setup is a hurdle for the unskilled person, any individual with
microbiological training would potentially be able to set up an
improvised production line for the manufacturing of a low- to
medium-quality slurry of spores, infectious enough for application in a
terror plot. Bacteria in general are more suitable for targeting large
crowds, due to the spreading of spores and the contagious nature of most
microbes. Additionally, secondary infections spreading from the primary
victims would potentially broaden the impact of the attack, putting the
public in danger and constituting a challenge to containment policy.
However, this scenario is unlikely in the case of anthrax, since B.
anthracis is not spread by person-to-person transmission. Viruses were
not considered in any of the identified cases. While viral diseases,
such as Lassa or Ebola, often result in high mortality rates, their
confined appearance in countries of, e.g., West Africa, pose high
hurdles for their acquisition. Additionally, culturing and propagation
is dependent on eukaryotic host cells, which require sophisticated
bioreactors, unlikely to be found outside of the pharmaceutical or
biotechnological industry. High demands on sterile working and culturing
conditions, to avoid contamination of the culture broth or for
self-protection against the agent, further complicate the use of
viruses. Sophisticated agents of chemical warfare, such as mustard,
sarin, and VX, were only identified in one incident. These agents are
highly effective in targeting large groups of humans and have a long
history of application in warfare because of their high toxicity, the
ease of dispersal due to their volatile nature, and their frightening
characteristics.71 However, they are also difficult for individuals or
small groups to acquire or produce in a self-developed setup. This is
especially visible in the case of Demetrius Crocker, the only
far-right-aligned terrorist who tried to acquire a sophisticated agent
of chemical warfare, the organophosphorus compound "sarin." Crocker did
not intend to manufacture the nerve agent himself, but attempted to buy
it from a potential supplier who was in fact a federal undercover
agent.72 The synthesis of sophisticated agents of chemical warfare not
only requires chemical components of high purity and in-depth knowledge
of the synthesis process, but also places high demands on the safety and
sophistication of the manufacturing equipment, location, and storage.73
These requirements are unlikely to be met by individuals or small groups
with no access to industrial or academic laboratories. This complicated
procedure has so far only been accomplished by the highly organized Aum
Shinrikyo cult, resulting in the 1995 sarin attack on the Tokyo subway,
and the ISIL terrorist semi-state. More easily accessible are toxic
industrial materials of the chemical industry, such as sulfur dioxide,
hydrofluoric acid, or chlorine, which are transported in hazardous goods
transports on road and railways. Chlorine, which reacts strongly with
the water on the human mucosa and thus potentially results in airway
injury ("dry-land drowning"),74 might be the chemical agent which can be
acquired most easily by terrorists. Chlorine can be obtained from a
variety of shops or, in even larger scale, from a wide variety of
industrial applications.75 However, chlorine was identified in none of
the analyzed incidents. Similar to sophisticated weapons of chemical
warfare, obtaining radioactive material constitutes a large barrier for
its application in terrorist attacks. This is also visible in the low
number of incidents which involved radiological agents. Only four out of
the 31 analyzed incidents were found to include radioactive substances,
and reliable data was accessible for only three. Additionally, we find
no unifying characteristics in these incidents, with the incidents
ranging from the scifi-esque construction of a technically unfeasible
"death-ray," 76 to the harvesting of radioactive material from household
smoke detectors. Americium and thorium, which were acquired by Brandon
Russel, are alpha emitters, which possess only low penetration power,
making radiological toxification by external application to the human
skin unlikely. However, combining these elements with explosives, such
as the hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) found at the crime
scene, might lead to intake of radioactive splinters after penetration
of the skin, or inhalation of airborne particles into the human body
after detonating the dispersal device. Either way, detonating a "dirty
bomb" is a frightening thought to many. In conclusion, the most
frequently used agents in far-right-inspired CBRN terror incidents are
those which can be easily obtained and require low technical knowledge
for production, e.g., cyanide compounds or self-isolated ricin (21 out
of 31 incidents). Agents which are more complex to obtain, e.g.,
requiring a microbiological production 18 D. KOEHLER AND P. POPELLA
line, equipment for chemical synthesis, or the acquisition of
radiological material, constitute the minority of the incidents (10 out
of 31). Implications for law enforcement, counter-measures, and future
research The analysis of the dataset outlined in this article presents
potential challenges for law enforcement and preventative
counter-measures, if the number of actors seeking to weaponize CBRN
agents or their level of technical sophistication increase. Most of the
advanced plots in the dataset were uncovered by chance, not by
investigative work, or were never executed due to other circumstances
(e.g., the plotter being murdered or arrested for different crimes).
However, the clear majority of plots failed to materialize due to the
perpetrators' lack of capability in relation to the pursued agents'
complexity in manufacturing and weaponization. Furthermore, several
plots were detected by other unrelated criminal activities of the
perpetrators and what seems to be insufficient operational security.
Nevertheless, the growing availability of necessary chemical,
biological, and radiological components as well as technical equipment,
in combination with the willingness to plot indiscriminate attacks
within parts of the far-right environment, give reasons for concern. As
a consequence, law enforcement agencies such as the FBI rely on a
"culture of security awareness" and a "well-informed" "citizenry" 77
within the chemical and biological industries to identify potentially
dangerous individuals or groups plotting CBRN attacks as early as
possible. Building such a well-informed citizenry, however, would
require a widespread net of training programs and providers specialized
in various aspects of countering violent extremism (CVE), hand-tailored
for different target groups. Education packages such as the "State and
Local Anti-Terrorism Training Program (SLATT)" for police officers
should therefore be expanded and adapted for other target groups.
Furthermore, dedicated counselling programs helping with the initial
assessment of a potentially high-risk case have proven to be effective
in other contexts of right-wing terrorism as well, as shown by a 2017
case of a disrupted mass-shooting plot against Muslims in Florida
through concerned citizen reports.78 Future research should compare the
specific characteristics of ideologically based CBRN plots and
incidents. The data presented here poses challenges to some currently
held assumptions regarding the most likely actors behind CBRN attacks.
Far-right actors have been significantly under-researched in terrorism
studies, even though the number and successful acquisition of CBRN
agents in many of these plots over the last decades should have caused
more interest from researchers and policy makers to better understand
the risks and nature of the phenomenon in general. Finally, this article
is based on openaccess information (mostly derived from press reports
and government documents), which of course harbors a not insignificant
risk for bias and incomplete or false information. Much more verified
and independent data collection on far-right (CBRN) terrorism is
essential to increase knowledge and opportunities for comparative
research on this form of political violence. Most of the plots in the
dataset presented here have not been included in academic terrorism
databases or have not been the subject of academic research so far.
Compared with other forms, e.g., jihadist terrorism, the scrutiny and
available data for right-wing terrorism in general is still concerningly
weak. Technically, the majority of far-right CBRN plots displayed a low
complexity and sophistication and involved no likely mass casualty risk
if they had been carried out successfully. TERRORISM AND POLITICAL
VIOLENCE 19 Nevertheless, the potentially large psychological effects of
such attack scenarios in combination with an increased availability of
agents and technical knowledge, might make CBRN plots more attractive
for violent far-right (and other) extremist actors in the future.
Conclusion Far-right CBRN terrorism is rare and small in scale, but a
real threat to Western countries. For decades, a small number of
right-wing extremists have continuously attempted to and in many cases
succeeded in acquiring CBRN materials, weaponizing, and plotting to use
them in terror attacks. Even though the overall number of incidents
appears small when compared to other forms of political violence, and
the technical sophistication of the plots was very low, it must not be
overlooked that even one successful CBRN attack with an indiscriminate
target could have significant psychological or physical consequences.
This first-ever descriptive quantitative study of the characteristics of
far-right CBRN terrorism gives strong indications that this form of
right-wing terrorism has characteristics which contradict some current
widely held assumptions among academics and policy makers. Far-right
CBRN terrorism appears to be predominantly a lone-actor phenomenon,
oftentimes involving middle-aged and comparatively well-educated male
perpetrators, mostly motivated by non-religious forms of far-right
ideology and aiming for an indiscriminate targeting of victims. Based on
that assessment, law enforcement faces potentially significant
challenges in the case of a growing interest and sophistication of
domestic far-right terrorists in CBRN terror tactics, and should be
adequately trained and equipped to handle the potential threat.
Nevertheless, this analysis also points directly to the need for a whole
society approach to countering violent extremism and radicalization, as
this might be the key point of intervention. Far-right CBRN terrorism is
usually the result of long-term radicalization processes involving
elaborate careers of political violence and action, based on the age and
known biographies of the perpetrators in our sample. Finally, this
article found that right-wing CBRN terrorism has to date been rare and
mostly unsophisticated or entirely inept, which is an encouraging
outcome. However, **[it became clear that some right-wing terrorists
have been motivated to pursue CBRN materials in order to weaponize them.
Future terrorists might be more capable, and even failed or crude
attacks can have significant consequences.]{.underline}**

**[Based on a new dataset of far-right CBRN incidents]{.underline}**
drawing on open-source material (press reports, governmental documents,
academic publications), we demonstrate that far-right CBRN terrorism is
a rare but existing form of far-right terrorism. With a total of 31
identified incidents, **[the]{.underline}** main **[findings of this
analysis challenge]{.underline}** some **[commonly held conceptions in
CBRN and WMD terrorism research]{.underline}** (e.g., that CBRN
terrorism is usually a tactic used by groups based on a religious
ideology). First, lone actors are predominant in attempted acquisition
and use of CBRN weapons in far-right CBRN incidents (67 percent or 14
incidents of 21, excluding hoaxes and protoplots) rather than groups
(including pairs of two). Second, **[non-religious forms of far-right
ideology]{.underline}** (i.e., **[neo-Nazism and]{.underline}**
non-religious **[white supremacism]{.underline}**) **[are the widest
held ideological beliefs of]{.underline}** far-right **[CBRN
plotters]{.underline}** (58 percent or 18 incidents from the overall
sample of 31). Furthermore, **[strategies of indiscriminate attack are
more common]{.underline}** (61 percent or 19 incidents from the overall
sample of 31) than either discriminate or unknown targeting. Lastly, it
is striking that **[more incidents with information about far-right CBRN
plotters' profession and education involved]{.underline}** more
**[plotters with upper and lower white-collar backgrounds]{.underline}**
(32 percent or 14 persons) than blue-collar backgrounds (16 percent or
six persons), when excluding hoaxes and protoplots from the sample
(leaving 38 identified persons involved in the incidents). The average
age of plotters is 47 years (excluding those with unknown age, hoaxes,
and protoplots), meaning that as a consequence far-right **[CBRN
terrorism tends to be a phenomenon of rather well-educated middle-aged
men]{.underline}** (only six female suspects out of the total sample of
66 persons were identified). Additional findings about agents, plot
dynamics, and complexity are presented below and the implications for
law enforcement and counter-measures are discussed.

Far-Right Extremism in the United States

Like the United States, **[Europe faces a growing threat from extreme
right-wing groups]{.underline}**. As Figure 3 highlights, extreme
right-wing attacks have significantly increased---from 0 in 2012 to 9 in
2013; 21 in 2016; and 30 in 2017. 32 European Union Security
Commissioner Sir Julian King has expressed serious concern about the
"growing menace" of right-wing extremism: "I'd just like to pause for
one moment on this. **[I'm not aware of a single EU member state that is
not affected]{.underline}** in some way **[by right-wing violent
extremism]{.underline}**." 33 In 2011, 77 died in a series of attacks by
a lone right-wing extremist in Oslo and the island of Utoya. Violent
groups include the Identitäre Bewegung Deutschland (IBD, Identitarian
Movement Germany) and supporters of the Reich Citizen ideology in
Germany; the Generace Identity (Generation of Identity) movement and the
Pro-Vlast movement in the Czech Republic; Soldiers of Odin in Belgium;
and the Blood & Honour organization in Portugal. In the UK, extreme
right-wing groups have not presented a significant terrorism threat
until recently, partly in response to rising domestic concerns about
refugees and asylum-seekers from countries like Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2016 and 2017, the UK banned the far-right groups National Action,
Scottish Dawn, and National Socialist Anti-Capitalist Action under the
Terrorism Act 2000. 36 There also have been several right-wing attacks
in the UK. Examples include the June 2017 killing of one individual by
Darren Osborne at the Finsbury Park Mosque, and the June 2016
assassination of UK Labour Member of Parliament Jo Cox by Thomas Mair.
**[Some extreme right-wing individuals and groups pose a particular
threat because they have stockpiled firearms and developed the
capability to build improvised explosive devices.]{.underline}** 37 As
**[the UK government concluded]{.underline}** in 2018, "**[We assess the
threat from extreme right-wing terrorism is growing]{.underline}**." 38
The threat from extreme right-wing groups and individuals is likely more
acute in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. As the European Union
Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation concluded, "Five foiled, failed
or completed terrorist attacks attributed to rightwing extremists (RWE)
were reported for 2017: all of them by the UK." 39 In 2017 and early
2018, the UK arrested 27 individuals on suspicion of being a member of
National Action, 15 of whom were charged with terrorism offenses. In
addition, the British domestic intelligence agency, MI5, and the police
disrupted nearly a half-dozen right-wing terrorist plots in the UK in
the first half of 2018. 40 France also has experienced isolated acts of
far-right extremism. In June 2018, for example, French authorities
arrested 10 suspected far-right extremists---including a retired police
officer and a retired soldier---from the group Action des Forces
Opérationnelles who allegedly were plotting to attack Muslims. They had
stockpiled rifles, handguns, homemade grenades, and ammunition around
Paris, the Mediterranean island of Corsica, and the western
Charentes-Maritimes region. 41 Unlike the Finsbury Park attack in the
UK, the Action des Forces Opérationnelles plotters claimed they were
"only" planning to attack jihadists, radical preachers, and "radicalized
individuals"---yet their definition of "radicalized" individuals
included women wearing veils. Much like in the United States,
**[right-wing networks and individuals have broadened their contacts in
other countries, especially in Europe and North America]{.underline}**.
In addition, right-wing extremists also have increasingly leveraged the
internet and social media. As the German Ministry of Interior concluded:

#### Right-wing terrorism will use nuclear & biological weapons -- they have the capacity & intent

the University of Hamburg top of his class, religion, economics &

<https://icct.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Koehler-Violence-and-Terrorism-from-the-Far-Right-February-2019.pdf>

These highlighted attacks, which received considerable public attention,
are infamous examples of a potential new wave of right-wing violence and
terrorism. The Center for International and Strategic Studies (CSIS)
found that **[the number of terrorist attacks by far-right perpetrators
doubled between 2016 and 2017 in the United States and jumped 43% in
Europe]{.underline}** in that same timeframe.8 Supporting this notion,
the Global Terrorism Index9 found that right-wing groups and individuals
killed 66 people between 2013 and 2017, with 17 deaths and 47 of those
attacks occurring in 2017.10 In the United States, **[this trend goes
back several years]{.underline}**, as data collected by the Washington
Post showed "a decades-long drop-off in violence by left-wing groups,
\[while\] **[violence by white supremacists and other far-right
attackers has been on the rise since Barack Obama's
presidency]{.underline}** --- and has surged since President Trump took
office".11 Broken down by perpetrators, the source of the main threat in
the U.S. appears clear: "**[Of 263 incidents of domestic
terrorism]{.underline}** between 2010 and the end of 2017, a third ---
**[92]{.underline}** --- **[were committed by right-wing
attackers]{.underline}** (...). Another third was committed by attackers
whose motives were either unknown or not clearly political. **[Islamist
terrorists committed 38 attacks.]{.underline}** And left-wing attackers
were responsible for 34 attacks --- about 13 percent."12 Furthermore,
**[right-wing extremists have also shown a long-term interest in
acquiring Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear]{.underline}**
(CBRN) **[weapons]{.underline}**, **[which resulted in a number of CBRN
far-right terrorist plots]{.underline}** in Western countries (mostly in
the U.S.), which luckily so far did not manage to come to fruition.13
Another development is the phenomenon of individuals participating in
extreme right-wing terrorist plots without previous contacts to the
extremist environment, something sometimes described as "Hive
Terrorism". 14 **[All of the above appears to indicate a significant
terrorist threat posed by extreme right-wing activists and
groups]{.underline}**.

### Internal -- Domestic Terrorism

#### Ukrainian fascist organizations fuel domestic US terrorism

According to a recent FBI indictment, **[several American white
supremacists were]{.underline}** allegedly **[radicalized
by]{.underline}** and received training from **[Ukraine's neo-Nazi Azov
Battalion]{.underline}**, which receives funding from the [current
government of

as well as [the

government. The group has also received weapons from the [Israeli
government](https://therealnews.com/stories/israel-is-arming-ukraines-blatantly-neo-nazi-militia-the-azov-battalion).
**[The]{.underline}**
[**[indictment]{.underline}**](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RAM-rioting-Rundo-et-al-COMPLAINT133873.pdf),
filed in Los Angeles, California last month, **[asserts that four
American members of the "Rise Above Movement"]{.underline}** (RAM) ---
[RAM co-founder Robert Rundo]{.underline} as well as Robert Boman, Tyler
Laube and Aaron Eason --- **[had "violently attacked and assaulted
counter-protestors" at several white nationalist and white supremacist
events]{.underline}** throughout the U.S., including the violent ["Unite
the
Right"](http://www.mintpressnews.com/right-wing-extremists-condemned-charlottesville-funded-armed-ukraine-syria/230897/)
rally in Charlottesville last year. The named individuals are alleged to
have "used the Internet to coordinate combat training in preparation for
the events" and to have celebrated "their acts of violence in order to
recruit members for future events." Court documents refer to RAM as a
"white supremacy extremist group" while the group self-represents as "a
combat-ready, militant group of a new nationalist white
supremacy/identity movement." The recent indictment gives special
attention to **[Rundo's]{.underline}** more recent activities,
particularly his trip to Europe earlier this year where he **[traveled
to]{.underline}** Germany, **[Ukraine]{.underline}**, and Italy "**[to
meet with members of European white supremacy extremist
groups."]{.underline}** The FBI became aware that one of the individuals
with whom Rundo had met during this trip was Olena Semenyaka, a leader
of the International Department for the National Corps, a Ukrainian
political party that was formed as an offshoot of the Azov Battalion in
2016. [The
affidavit](https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RAM-rioting-Rundo-et-al-COMPLAINT133873.pdf)
detailing Rundo's meeting with Semenyaka, signed by FBI agent Scott
Bierwirth, states that "the Azov Battalion is a paramilitary unit of the
Ukrainian National Guard which is known for its association with
neo-Nazi ideology and use of Nazi symbolism." It then adds that **[Azov
Battalion "is believed to have participated in training and radicalizing
United States-based white supremacy organizations]{.underline}**," such
as RAM. In other words, the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion is suspected by the
U.S. government of both training and radicalizing violent white
supremacist groups based in America. **[This is particularly troubling
when one considers the fact that the U.S. government directly enabled
the Azov Battalion's growth and prominence]{.underline}**. Now, it seems
that **[those actions have translated into troubling domestic
consequences for the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

### Impact -- bioterrorism

The risks from anthropogenic hazards appear at present larger than those
from natural ones. Although great progress has been made in reducing the
number of nuclear weapons in the world, [humanity
is]{.underline} still [threatened by ]{.underline}the possibility of
a [global thermonuclear war]{.underline} and a resulting nuclear
winter. **[[We may face]{.mark} even [greater risks from emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies. [Advances in synthetic biology]{.mark} might [make
it possible to engineer pathogens capable of extinction]{.mark}-level
pandemics]{.underline}**. The knowledge, equipment, and materials needed
to engineer pathogens are more accessible than those needed to build
nuclear weapons. And [unlike other weapons, [pathogens are
self-replicating]{.mark}, [allowing a small arsenal to become]{.mark}
exponentially [destructive]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pathogens have been
implicated in the extinctions of many wild species. [Although most
pandemics \"fade out]{.underline}\" by reducing the density of
susceptible populations, pathogens with wide host ranges in multiple
species can reach even isolated individuals. The intentional or
unintentional release of **[[engineered pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[with high transmissibility]{.underline}, [latency]{.underline}, [and
lethality **[might be capable of causing]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While such an event seems unlikely
today, the likelihood may increase as biotechnologies continue to
improve at a rate rivaling Moore\'s Law.

### Impact -- nuclear terrorism

#### Nuclear terrorism causes global nuclear war.

Atomic Scientists*, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2018.1436812)

But [the consequences would go far beyond the effects in the target
country]{.underline}, however, [and]{.underline} promptly **[propagate
worldwide]{.underline}**. [Global and national security, economy and
finance, international governance and its framework, national political
systems, and the behavior of governments and individuals would all be
put under **severe trial**]{.underline}. The severity of the effects at
a national level, however, would depend on the countries' level of
development, geopolitical location, and resilience. [Global security and
regional/national defense schemes would be strongly
affected]{.underline}. [An **[increase in global distrust]{.mark}**
[would]{.mark} **[spark rising tensions]{.mark}** among countries
[and]{.mark} blocs]{.underline}, [that could even [lead to]{.mark} the
**brink of [nuclear weapons use]{.mark}** by states]{.underline} (if,
for instance, a sponsor country is identified). [The
[consequences]{.mark} of]{.underline} such [a shocking scenario
[would]{.mark} [include]{.mark} a **decrease in states'
self-control**]{.underline}, [an **[escalation of present
conflicts]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[emergence of new ones]{.mark}**,
[accompanied by]{.mark} an **increase in [military
unilateralism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} military expenditures]{.underline}.
Regarding the economic and financial impacts[, a **[severe global
economic depression]{.mark}** would rise from the attack]{.underline},
likely **[[lasting for years]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Its duration would
be strongly dependent on the course of the crisis. The main results of
such a crisis would include a 2 percent fall of growth in global Gross
Domestic Product, and a 4 percent decline of international trade in the
two years following the attack (cf. Figure 3). In the case of developing
and less-developed countries, the economic impacts would also include a
shortage of high-technology products such as medicines, as well as a
fall in foreign direct investment and a severe decline of international
humanitarian aid toward low-income countries. We expect an increase of
unemployment and poverty in all countries. Global poverty would raise
about 4 percent after the attack, which implies that at least 30 million
more people would be living in extreme poverty, in addition to the
current estimated 767 million. [In the area of international
relations]{.underline}, [we would expect a **breakdown of key
doctrines** involving politics]{.underline}, [security, and relations
among states]{.underline}. These [**[international tensions could lead
to a collapse of the nuclear order]{.mark}** as we know it
today]{.underline}, [with a consequent **[setback]{.mark} of nuclear
disarmament** and **[nonproliferation]{.mark}
commitments**]{.underline}. In other words, [[the whole]{.mark} system
based on the Nuclear **[N]{.mark}**on- **[P]{.mark}**roliferation
**[T]{.mark}**reaty [would be put under **severe
trial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [After the attack]{.underline}, [there
would be a reassessment of existing security doctrines]{.underline}, and
a deep review of concepts such as nuclear deterrence, no-firstuse,
proportionality, and negative security assurances. Finally, the behavior
of governments and individuals would also change radically. **[[Internal
chaos]{.underline}]{.mark}** [fueled by the media and social networks
would **[threaten governance at all levels]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [with
greater impact on those countries with weak institutional
frameworks]{.underline}. [**[Social turbulence]{.mark}** would
[emerge]{.mark} in most countries]{.underline}, [with consequent
**attempts by governments to impose restrictions on personal freedoms to
preserve order**]{.underline} -- possibly [by declaring a state of siege
or **state of emergency**]{.underline} -- and [legislation would surely
become tougher on human rights]{.underline}. [[There
would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[significant increase in social fragmentation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- with a [deepening of antagonistic views]{.underline},
[mistrust]{.underline}, [and intolerance]{.underline}, both within
countries and towards others -- and a [resurgence of large-scale social
movements fostered by ideological interests and **easily mobilized**
through social media]{.underline}.

### Impact -- EU impact

#### Anti-immigrant populism spills over to trade protectionism which triggers European war

**Friedman 15** (1/27, George, PhD in Government, former Professor of
Political Science at Dickenson College, founder, CIO, and CEO of
STRATFOR, "The New Drivers of Europe\'s Geopolitics,"
https://www.stratfor.com/weekly/new-drivers-europes-geopolitics)

[Virtually every European country has developed growing movements that
oppose the European Union and its policies]{.underline}.
[Most]{.underline} of these are [on the right of the political
spectrum]{.underline}. This means that in addition to their economic
grievances, [they want to regain control of their borders]{.underline}
to limit immigration. Opposition movements have also emerged from the
left --- Podemos in Spain, for instance, and of course, Syriza in
Greece. The left has the same grievances as the right, save for the
racial overtones. But what is important is this: [Greece has been seen
as the outlier, but it is in fact **the leading edge of the European
crisis**]{.underline}. [It was the first to face default]{.underline},
the first [to impose austerity]{.underline}, the first [to experience
the brutal weight]{.underline} that resulted [and]{.underline} now it is
the first [to elect a government that pledges to end
austerity]{.underline}. **[Left or right, these parties are threatening
Europe\'s traditional parties]{.underline}**, which the middle and lower
class see as being complicit with Germany in creating the austerity
regime. Syriza has moderated its position on the European Union, as
parties are wont to moderate during an election. But its position is
that it will negotiate a new program of Greek debt repayments to its
European lenders, one that will relieve the burden on the Greeks. [There
is reason to believe that **it might succeed**]{.underline}. The Germans
don\'t care if Greece pulls out of the euro. Germany is, however,
terrified that the political movements that are afoot will end or
inhibit Europe\'s free-trade zone. Right-wing parties\' goal of limiting
the cross-border movement of workers already represents an open demand
for an end to the free-trade zone for labor. [But Germany, the export
addict, needs the free-trade zone badly]{.underline}. [This is one of
the points that people miss. They are concerned that countries will
withdraw from the euro]{.underline}. As Hungary showed when the
forint\'s decline put its citizens in danger of defaulting on mortgages,
a nation-state has the power to protect its citizens from debt if it
wishes to do so. The Greeks, inside or outside the eurozone, can also
exercise this power. In addition to being unable to repay their debt
structurally, they cannot afford to repay it politically. The parties
that supported austerity in Greece were crushed. The mainstream parties
in other European countries saw what happened in Greece and are aware of
the rising force of Euroskepticism in their own countries. The ability
of these parties to comply with these burdens is dependent on the
voters, and their political base is dissolving. Rational politicians are
not dismissing Syriza as an outrider. The issue then is not the euro.
Instead, the first real issue is the effect of structured or
unstructured defaults on the European banking system and how the
European Central Bank, committed to not making Germany liable for the
debts of other countries, will handle that. The second, and more
important, issue is now the future of the free-trade zone. [Having open
borders seemed like a good idea]{.underline} during prosperous times,
[but the fear of Islamist terrorism]{.underline} and the fear of
Italians competing with Bulgarians for scarce jobs **[make those open
borders less and less likely to endure]{.underline}**. And [if nations
can erect walls for people, then **why not erect walls for goods** to
protect their own industries and jobs?]{.underline} In the long run,
**[protectionism hurts the economy]{.underline}**, but Europe is dealing
with many people who don\'t have a long run, have fallen from the
professional classes and now worry about how they will feed their
families. [For Germany]{.underline}, which depends on free access to
Europe\'s markets to help prop up its export-dependent economy, [the
loss of the euro would be the loss of a tool for managing
trade]{.underline} within and outside the eurozone. But the rise of
protectionism in Europe would be a calamity. The [German economy would
stagger]{.underline} without those exports. From my point of view, [the
argument about austerity is over]{.underline}. The European Central Bank
ended the austerity regime half-heartedly last week, and the Syriza
victory sent an earthquake through Europe\'s political system, although
the Eurocratic elite will dismiss it as an outlier. [If Europe\'s
defaults]{.underline} --- structured or unstructured ---
[surge]{.underline} as a result, [the question of **the euro becomes**
an **interesting but non-critical** issue]{.underline}. [What will
become the issue, and what is already becoming the issue, is **free
trade.**]{.underline} **[That is the core of the European
concept]{.underline}**, [and that is the next issue on the agenda as the
German narrative loses credibility and the Greek narrative replaces
it]{.underline} as the conventional wisdom. [It is not hard to imagine
the disaster that would ensue if the United States were to export 50
percent of its GDP, and half of it went to Canada and
Mexico]{.underline}. A free-trade zone in which the giant pivot is not a
net importer can\'t work. And [that is exactly the situation in
Europe]{.underline}. Its pivot is Germany, but rather than serving as
the engine of growth by being an importer, it became the world\'s
fourth-largest national economy by exporting half its GDP. That can\'t
possibly be sustainable. Possible Seismic Changes Ahead There are then
three drivers in Europe now. One is the desire to control borders ---
nominally to control Islamist terrorists but truthfully to limit the
movement of all labor, Muslims included. Second, there is the
empowerment of the nation-states in Europe by the European Central Bank,
which is making its quantitative easing program run through national
banks, which may only buy their own nation\'s debt. Third, there is
**[the political base]{.underline}**, which [**is dissolving** under
Europe\'s feet]{.underline}. The question about Europe now is not
whether it can retain its current form, but how radically that form will
change. And [the most daunting question is whether Europe, unable to
maintain its union, will **see a return of nationalism and its possible
consequences**]{.underline}. As I put it in Flashpoints: [The most
important question in the world is whether conflict and war have
actually been banished or whether this is merely an interlude, **a
seductive illusion**]{.underline}. [Europe is the single most prosperous
region in the world.]{.underline} Its collective GDP is greater than
that of the United States. [It touches Asia, the Middle East and
Africa]{.underline}. **[Another series of wars would change not only
Europe, but the entire world]{.underline}**.

#### EU collapse crushes the global economy and makes it impossible to solve a litany of existential threats

**Markley 16** (Stephen Markley, "Is France the Final Domino for the
European Union?," 12-15-16,
<https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/12/is-france-the-final-domino-for-the-european-union.html>)

If 2016 has taught us anything, it's to pay heed to previously
outlandish possibilities because those possibilities are itching to
stand and be counted. One such outcome, which now seems frighteningly
close to reality, is [**the sudden collapse of** the European
Union.]{.underline} Following the United Kingdom's exit from **[the
EU]{.underline}** and the election of Donald Trump in the United States,
it's clear the rising tide of nationalism, anti-globalism, and sheer
discontent is actually a rather monstrous wave which may yet prove to be
a tsunami. All eyes have landed **[on]{.underline}** [the French
presidential election]{.underline} where the hard-right Francois Fillon
clinched the Republican party nomination, while the perennial challenge
from the National Front's even-further-right-wing Marine [**Le Pen**
remains a]{.underline} Francophile [Black Swan]{.underline}. Le Pen and
the National Front have long dabbled on the borders of outright racism,
and let's just say her kindler, gentler platform includes immigration
controls, a fight against Islamism, a rebuff of "savage globalization,"
and a promise for a referendum on EU membership should she win. Sound
familiar? Forces of moderation have long kept Le Pen's father and
political predecessor Jean-Marie Le Pen and the National Front at bay.
Because France requires presidential candidates to win an outright
majority in a run-off and there's no version of the Electoral College to
throw the race to a candidate for whom the majority of people have not
voted, [Le Pen is still seen as a long shot by most conventional
analysts, but in the current climate all bets are off]{.underline}. Even
if Fillon wins, it's not unreasonable to think that he'll face pressure
from his right flank to hold an EU referendum, a la David Cameron. Even
prominent figures on the French left like former economy minister Arnaud
Montebourg and candidate of the left-wing Parti de Gauche have described
their displeasure with the EU's economic prescriptions. This ennui could
leach into non-National Front voters. A "**[Frexit]{.underline}**"
within the next two to three years **[is a very real
possibility]{.underline}**. [Without France, the Eurozone would be down
to Germany and a host of economically weaker satellite
countries]{.underline}. How long would German voters go on supporting
this crumbling edifice? The over-under begins on the date of the next
German election. Meanwhile in Italy, the defeat of a constitutional
referendum has thrown the government into a tailspin and marked the rise
of Beppo Grille and the Five Star Movement. Grille, an entertainer who
came to fame on Italian TV in the 1970s and 80s has "capitalized on his
showbiz bravado" to spearhead Italy's eurosceptic movement (again, see
anything recognizable?). His party and the far-right Northern League,
which still aligns itself with fascist leader Benito Mussolini, are seen
as likely to make gains when the next general election is held. In many
ways this crisis is one of the EU and member states' own making. It
pursued a continent-wide program of austerity following one of the
greatest financial crises since the Great Depression. While the United
States fought the 2008 downturn with a counter-cyclical Keynesian
package (and still ended up with a backlash and austerity), many
European governments (especially the UK) as well as the European
Commission and European Central Bank pursued deficit reduction, cutbacks
to social services, and tax increases, creating enmity towards Brussels
on both sides of the political spectrum. Austerity was a total disaster.
The migrant crisis and terrorist attacks in France have taken their
tolls as well. [This momentum has a danger in and of
itself.]{.underline} It would be one thing if the 28 EU member nations
spent five to ten years carefully negotiating a series of decisions that
would lead to the dissolution of the project of post-war European
integration, a dissolve in which everyone carefully considered the
outcomes this would have on trade, mutual defense, currency, migration,
travel, regulation, and every other sector of European society. However,
[what is becoming clear is that **if and when the crack-up occurs it
will be abrupt**, **startling**, **and no one will have
control**]{.underline} over the results, let alone any idea about the
unintended consequences that lie ahead. It's important to stress that
one not need be a defender of the EU's every practice or claim that its
foundation did not contain follies (for instance a single currency
without true political union and uniform monetary policies) to fear the
implications of its sudden collapse. There's a strain of thinking that
goes, "Well, the EU is run by unelected neoliberal elites jamming
economic liberalization down the throats of member nations. Let it
burn." But this attitude ignores a rather glaring problem: [no one knows
what the hell would happen in the event of an EU collapse]{.underline}.
When I say no one, I don't just mean the average British, French,
German, Italian, Irish, or Latvian voter. I mean no economist, no
politician, no banker, no one in Brussels, London, Paris, or Berlin has
any clue what **[the consequences of a "Eurexit]{.underline}**" might
be. Suffice it to say, a best-case scenario **[makes]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** uncertainty surrounding the
2007-20**[08]{.underline}** **[financial crisis look like a common
cold.]{.underline}** At least in that case, the ruling elite at least
understood what it could do to prevent a panic and **[subsequent global
depression]{.underline}**. Take the example of the French. If France
were to leave the safety of the German economy, it **[would
land]{.underline}** on its own with a highly devalued Franc and a
national debt that equals 96% of the country's GDP. Even France,
however, is in far better shape than the smaller economies of the
Eurozone. Former Prime Minister of Ireland, John Bruton, penned an op-ed
in 2015 during the height of the Greek mess and in anticipation of the
coming Brexit vote, which outlined some of [the more dangerous
possibilities of **a Eurozone collapse**]{.underline}. It's worth
quoting at length: New currencies would have to be established. The
relative value of these currencies would be unknown and unknowable. Some
would lose value very quickly and others would shoot up in value.
[Exports would become dramatically uncompetitive in some
cases]{.underline}, and in others they would become so cheap that there
would be accusations of dumping, currency manipulation, and calls for
immediate reintroduction of import duties to level the playing field...
In some countries **[the banking system would break down]{.underline}**,
and people would have no access to credit for even the most basic
transactions. In others, people would cease to trust the value of their
own money, and money, after all, is based on a promise and if people can
no longer trust the states standing behind the promise, the basis for
money is gone. As Bruton points out, this has happened before. Following
the break-up of the Soviet Union, the rouble zone collapsed in the
1990s, halving incomes in both exporter nations like Russia and importer
countries like Estonia. Everyone suffered, no one was spared. Yes,
smaller countries would find themselves suffering particularly hard, but
the **[economic chaos would spread]{.underline}** to the sturdier
economies and almost certainly leak **[outside of Europe's
borders]{.underline}**. Nationalists currently point to Brexit and say,
"See? The sky hasn't fallen! Stop the fear-mongering" even as Brexit
continues along as a slow-rolling disaster. Theresa May and the British
political class seem to have laughably little clue or control, as
complex issues gather like slag at their feet. Take the headache the
country will have over low-skilled workers. As an aging population
increasingly needs elderly care, the UK will have no choice but to allow
in the same low-skill, low-wage foreign workers that so enraged Brexit
voters in the first place. It can either allow this immigration or face
a crisis with its senior care. Or take the example of [major banks
already eyeing the door and the likely possibility that London will no
longer be Europe's main financial center]{.underline}. Or the fact that
Europe accounts for roughly half of the UK's exports, and in order to
maintain that lifeblood of trade, its leaders will almost certainly have
to join the European Economic Area (enjoyed by such countries as Iceland
and Norway). In other words, it will have to agree to all the laws
relevant to the European single market and contribute to the budget of
the European Union but without having any vote, voice, or say in EU
decisions. The UK's economy will continue to flounder, slip once again
into recession, and the forces of nationalism will likely gain from it
as they bludgeon citizens with the same insipid propaganda that led to
the Brexit vote. This is why during the past eight years of muddling
through the Greek crisis, some European leaders kept saying the only way
forward is through increased European integration and democratic
governance. Bruton suggests one key reform necessary to creating a sense
of European identity, which would be to hold European-wide elections for
its president. Rather than having 27 different elections in 27 discreet
countries, the institution should have EU-wide party lists and an
EU-wide vote for the presidents of the European Union Commission and
Council (currently, these are selected in closed-door meetings by the
heads of government). Such reforms are not complicated, especially given
the alternative of an EU break-up. For many Americans reading this,
there is no doubt a sense of remove from the relevance of the European
project. Think of it this way: [**for centuries Europe was the Middle
East of the world**. It was a **war-hungry**, dysfunctional,
**violent**, **chaotic piece of the globe** that could barely go a
decade without a barbaric,]{.underline} usually [pointless blood-letting
conflict]{.underline}. Since World War II and the economic and political
integration that brought former nation-state rivals into mutually
beneficial coexistence, the continent has been a region of remarkable
prosperity and stability. Keep in mind, this has never happened before
in human history: a set of political leaders and their constituents
voluntarily chose to cede elements of sovereignty in order to form a
better, stronger union. The United States and Great Britain, often
mentioned as democratic ideals, were two empires won by violent conquest
in which wealthy elites only begrudgingly allowed democracy to sift down
to the most impoverished and brutalized citizens. The parochial
movements of the last five to ten years---from the EU's troubles to the
Scottish independence vote to the surge of American nationalism that
brought us such phenomenon as the go-it-alone war in Iraq and now Donald
Trump---have different roots and causes but they do share a common
thread. We live in an increasingly complex and interdependent world
where **[the greatest threats to peace]{.underline}**, individual
well-being, and human flourishing **[are]{.underline}** largely
**[transnational]{.underline}**. **[Climate change]{.underline}**,
infectious **[disease]{.underline}**, nuclear
**[proliferation]{.underline}**, **[financial crisis]{.underline}**,
**[cyber]{.underline}** insecurity---these are all borderless phenomenon
that do not care if their victims are French, British, American, or

### 2ac -- EU impact - Warming

#### Alliance collapse causes European defense spending and populism

**Fay 17** - Director of Defense and Foreign Policy Studies @ Niskan
(Matthew, "THE PROBLEM WITH EUROPE PAYING ITS DEFENSE BILLS," *Niskan
Center*,
<https://niskanencenter.org/blog/problem-europe-paying-defense-bills/>)

The two reasons Gilli notes for the inability of European states to
increase defense spending also raise another question: should the United
States want European states to do so? Writing at the end of the Cold
War, political scientist John Mearsheimer warned that a Europe free from
superpower domination would return to its recurrent patterns of
interstate warfare. [[Europe's major states would be **forced** to pay
for]{.mark} their own [defense absent]{.mark}
[American]{.mark}]{.underline} and Soviet [security [guarantees]{.mark}.
[To convince domestic populations to support]{.mark} investment in
[military]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}---likely [at the expense of
welfare spending]{.underline}---[[state leaders would likely lean on
**nationalist**]{.mark} **[rhetoric]{.mark}** and policies.]{.underline}
According to Mearsheimer, [the reason they have not had to do so was
because the American "pacifier" has remained in place even after the
superpower standoff in Europe ended]{.underline}. [An American
withdrawal as an effort to induce [greater defense spending]{.mark} in
Europe [might lead to the empowerment of]{.mark} the **very [nationalist
populist parties]{.mark}** [that would like to see the]{.mark} European
[Union **dismantled**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[**[disintegration]{.mark}** of Europe]{.underline}---[coupled with
increased spending on military capabilities by its largest
states]{.underline}---[could [lead to the return of security
competition]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the **[dilemmas]{.mark}** inherent in
it.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [smaller states]{.underline}---Estonia just
being one example---unable to invest sufficiently in their own defense
[will be subject to manipulation and domination by the continent's major
powers]{.underline}. So the question of whether the [Trump]{.underline}
administration should consider [withholding defense of America's
Europe]{.underline}an to encourage them to "pay their bills" hinges on
two things: whether they can, and if so, whether doing so
[is]{.underline} worth potentially **[undermining the peaceful
integration of Europe]{.underline}**.

#### European defense is [zero sum]{.underline} with US contractors 

**Clevenger 18** -- Roll Call \[Andrew, Jul 16, *Roll Call*, Higher NATO
Defense Spending May Not Help U.S. Contractors,
<https://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/higher-nato-defense-spending-may-not-help-u-s-contractors>\]

President Donald [Trump emerged from the NATO summit]{.underline} in
Brussels [touting]{.underline} a renewed [commitment from members to
increase]{.underline} their defense [spending]{.underline}, but [[U.S.
defense firms might want to **hold off on the
champagne**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- at least for now.

Trump claimed that European leaders had pledged to accelerate their
individual efforts to reach the goal of spending 2 percent of their
country's gross domestic product on defense, possibly hitting that
target sometime next year rather than by 2024 as originally planned.

But even if that happens --- NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg
signaled agreement with Trump in principle on higher defense spending
but did not commit to a specific time frame --- analysts said [[that
would not lead]{.mark} directly [to a windfall for]{.mark} [American
defense]{.mark} contractors.]{.underline}

"There's this double-edged sword to this U.S. desire that Europe" take
charge of its own defense, said Byron Callan, a defense analyst for
Capital Alpha Partners. [[The more Europe steps up]{.underline}
its]{.mark} [contributions]{.underline}, [[the more likely it]{.mark} is
that it [will seek to spend]{.mark} those [dollars **at
home**]{.mark}]{.underline} to benefit Europe's defense industrial base.

As Callan wrote in a note to investors, [[European defense stocks
outperformed U.S. defense stocks]{.underline}]{.mark} last week, [an
indication that]{.underline} [investors think it is European weapons
makers who will reap the benefit]{.underline} of any spending increases
that follow the summit.

"[[The market perceives this as the first **choices not being the
American primes**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Callan said, referring to the
biggest U.S. defense contractors. Defense dollars are seen as a source
of good jobs in Europe as they are in the United States, he said, so
[why would Europe choose to support jobs in America over jobs in
Germany, Italy or France]{.underline}?

"To me, [\[a boost in European spending\]]{.underline} logically [would
point to more support for European industry]{.underline} versus U.S.
industry," Callan said.

\[Trump Opens NATO Summit by Pitching a Fit\]

Decreases in NATO members' defense budgets in the years before Vladimir
Putin's takeover of Crimea in 2014 created readiness problems in Europe
just as they have in America, said Jorge Benitez, a senior fellow at the
Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security who
specializes in NATO and trans-Atlantic relations.

Speaking from Brussels, Benitez said [even if countries were able to
increase their defense budgets]{.underline} quickly, [not all would be
prepared to spend it in ways that would benefit the alliance
most]{.underline}. For example, England is accustomed to a more
prominent role in international security and has the needed acquisition
apparatus in place, while Germany does not.

[Germany has intentionally dragged its feet]{.underline} in this regard,
and [[the part of the German defense ministry]{.mark} that formulates
long-term plans]{.underline} has [[had a hiring freeze and is
**understaffed**]{.underline}]{.mark} by 1,000 people, he said.

"The alliance has more than doubled in size since the Cold War, so
[most]{.underline} of the [members are new to]{.underline} these
[collective defense missions]{.underline}," he said.

How to spend that money

Part of the challenge, said Rachel Rizzo, a fellow with the Center for a
New American Security's trans-Atlantic security program, is that
[individual members decide how to spend their own]{.underline} defense
[budgets]{.underline}. While the [[members from the Baltic
state]{.mark}s]{.underline} next door to Russia [[may view a **Russian
invasion** as the]{.mark} biggest [threat]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[members along the southern border may
b]{.underline}]{.mark}[e]{.underline} more **[[concerned with
refugees]{.underline}]{.mark}** fleeing unrest in Africa, she said.

"There isn't a shared threat perception among allies, which makes it
really difficult for the alliance as a whole to agree on where to focus
resources," she said from Brussels.

For Rizzo, the immediate threat is not so much that Russia will attack a
member state and trigger Article V of NATO's founding treaty, which
states that an attack against any member is viewed as an attack on all
members. More likely, she said, are Russian disinformation and
propaganda efforts to interfere in local politics, which are actions
more difficult to defeat and deter.

NATO's defense spending should focus more on the cyber realm and
emerging domains of warfare, like space, she said.

"We focus so much on this idea of 2 percent, and it really is an
arbitrary number," Rizzo said. "It's so much more important to focus on
where and how the money is spent."

Gordon Adams, a former international relations professor and author of
several books on national security and defense budgets, said the issue
with NATO is not that its members don't spend enough on defense, but
that there are too many redundancies in the capabilities different
governments buy.

Remove the overlap, and there's enough money to fund the needed
capabilities, he said, but that's very hard to accomplish politically.
"The last bastion of national sovereignty is your military capability,"
he said.

[The Europeans]{.underline} don't want to rely on American companies to
produce their military gear. "They [want to have a European
defense]{.underline} and technology [industrial base]{.underline}," he
said. "Why should they be any different than us? We want that."

[Trump makes it worse because]{.underline} instead of going over and
talking to the Europeans, [he]{.underline} goes over and **[bullies
them]{.underline}**, Adams said. The irony is that the predominant
reason for the Europeans' increasing their defense spending is that
they're beginning to worry about the reliability of the United States as
an ally, he said.

"**[[This is not a win for]{.mark} American [defense
contractors]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he said.

#### [Strong]{.underline} domestic defense is key to clean tech

**Gholz 14** - associate professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs
of The University of Texas at Austin \[Eugene, Fall 2014, *Issues in
Science and Technology, Volume XXXI, No. 1,* "Military Innovation and
the Prospects for Defense-Led Energy Innovation",
<https://issues.org/military-innovation-and-the-prospects-for-defense-led-energy-innovation/>\]

Almost all [[plans to address climate]{.mark} change **[depend on
innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, because the
[alternatives]{.underline} by themselves---[reducing greenhouse gas
emissions via the more efficient]{.underline} use of current
technologies [or]{.underline} by simply [consuming less]{.underline} of
everything---**[are either insufficient, intolerable, or
both.]{.underline}** [Americans are]{.underline} especially [proud of
their history of technology leadership]{.underline}, but in most sectors
of the economy, [they assume that private companies]{.underline}, often
led by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, [will furnish the new
products and processes]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [energy innovation
poses exceptionally severe collective action problems that limit the
private sector's]{.underline} promise. Everyone contributes emissions,
but no one contributes sufficient emissions that a conscious effort to
reduce them will make a material difference in climate change, so few
people try hard. [Without a carbon tax or emissions cap, most companies
have little or no economic incentive to reduce emissions]{.underline}
except as a fortuitous byproduct of other investments. And [the system
of production, distribution, and use of energy creates interdependencies
across companies and countries that limit the ability of any one actor
to unilaterally make substantial changes]{.underline}.

In principle, governments can overcome these problems through policies
to coordinate and coerce, but politicians are ever sensitive to imposing
costs on their constituents. They avoid imposing taxes and costly
regulations whenever possible. Innovation presents the great hope to
solve problems at reduced cost. In the case of climate change, because
of the collective action problems, government will have to lead the
innovative investment.

Fortunately, [the U.S. government has a track record of success with
developing technologies to address]{.underline} another [public
good]{.underline}. [[Innovation is a **hallmark of the**]{.mark} **U.S.
[military]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The technology that U.S. soldiers,
sailors, and airmen bring to war far outclasses adversaries'. Even as
[Americans]{.underline} complain about challenges of deploying new
military equipment, always wishing that technical solutions could do
more and would arrive faster to the field, they also [take]{.underline}
justifiable [pride in the U.S. defense industry's routine exploitation
of technological opportunities]{.underline}. Perhaps [that industry's
technology [savvy could be harnessed to develop **low-emissions
technologies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And perhaps [the Defense
Department's]{.underline} hefty [purse could purchase enough to
drive]{.underline} the [innovations down the learning
curve]{.underline}, so that they could then compete in commercial
markets as low-cost solutions, too.

[That potential has attracted considerable interest in **defense-led
energy innovation**]{.underline}. In fact, in 2008, one of the first
prominent proposals to use defense acquisition to reduce energy demand
came from the Defense Science Board, a group of expert advisors to the
Department of Defense (DOD) itself. The DSB reported, "[By addressing
its own fuel demand, DoD can serve as a stimulus for new energy
efficiency technologies]{.underline}.... If DoD were to invest in
technologies that improved efficiency at a level commensurate with the
value of those technologies to its forces and warfighting capability, it
would probably become a technology incubator and provide mature
technologies to the market place for industry to adopt for commercial
purposes." Various think tanks took up the call from there, ranging from
the CNA Corporation (which includes the Center for Naval Analyses) to
the Pew Charitable Trusts' Project on National Security, Energy and
Climate. Ultimately, the then--Deputy Assistant to the President for
Energy and Climate Change, Heather Zichal, proclaimed her hope for
defense-led energy innovation on the White House blog in 2013.

These [[advocates hope]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[to use]{.mark}
the model of successful [military innovation]{.mark} to stimulate
innovation for green technologies but to actually use the machinery of
defense acquisition [to **implement their
plan**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [They]{.underline} particularly [hope
that the DOD will use its substantial procurement budget to pull the
**development of new energy** technologies]{.underline}. Even when the
defense budget faces cuts as the government tries to address its debt
problem, other kinds of government discretionary investment are even
more threatened, making defense ever more attractive to people who hope
for new energy technologies.

The U.S. government has in part adopted this agenda. The DOD and
Congress have created a series of high-profile positions that include an
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs
within the Pentagon's acquisition component. No one in the DOD's
leadership wants to see DOD investment diverted from its primary purpose
of providing for American national security, but the opportunity to
address two important policy issues at the same time is very appealing.

[The appeal of successful military innovation is seductive]{.underline},
but the military's [mixed experience with high-tech investment should
restrain some of the exuberance about prospects for energy
innovation.]{.underline} We know enough about why some large-scale
military innovation has worked, while some has not, to predict which
parts of the effort to encourage defense-led energy innovation are
likely to be successful; enough to refine our expectations and target
our investment strategies. This article carefully reviews the defense
innovation process and its implications for major defense-led energy
innovation.

[Defense innovation works]{.underline} [because of a particular
relationship between the **DOD and the defense industry** that channels
investment toward **specific technology trajectories**]{.underline}.
[Successes]{.underline} [on "nice-to-have" trajectories]{.underline},
from DOD's perspective, [are rare, because the leadership's real
interest focuses on national security]{.underline}. Civilians are well
aware of the national security and domestic political risks of even the
appearance of distraction from core warfighting missions. [When it is
time to make **hard choices**, DOD leadership will emphasize performance
parameters directly related to the **military's critical
warfighting**]{.underline} tasks, as essentially everyone agrees it
should. [Even in the relatively few cases in which
investment]{.underline} to solve the challenges of the energy sector
[might directly contribute]{.underline} to the military component of the
U.S. national security strategy, [advocates will **struggle** to harness
the defense acquisition]{.underline} [apparatus]{.underline}. But a
focused understanding of how that apparatus works will make their
efforts more likely to succeed.

How weapons innovation has succeeded

Defense acquisition is organized by programs, the largest and most
important of which are almost always focused on developing a weapons
system, although sometimes the key innovations that lead to improved
weapons performance come in a particular component. For example, a new
aircraft may depend on a better jet engine or avionics suite, but the
investment is usually organized as a project to develop a fighter rather
than one or more key components. Sometimes the DOD buys major items of
infrastructure such as a constellation of navigation satellites, but
those systems' performance metrics are usually closely tied to weapons'
performance; for example, navigation improves missile accuracy,
essential for modern warfare's emphasis on precision strike. Similarly,
a major improvement in radar can come as part of a weapons system
program built around that new technology, as the Navy's Aegis battle
management system incorporated the SPY-1 phased array radar on a new
class of ships. [To incorporate energy innovation into defense
acquisition, the DOD and the military services would similarly **add
energy-related performance parameters** to their programs, most of which
are weapons system programs]{.underline}. The military's focus links
technology to missions. Each project relies on a system of complex
interactions of military judgment, congressional politics, and defense
industry technical skill.

Defense [[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[worked]{.mark} best
[when]{.mark} [customers]{.mark}]{.underline}---DOD and the military
services---**[understand the technology trajectory]{.underline}** that
they are hoping to pull and when progress along that technology
trajectory is important to the customer organization's core mission.
[Under those circumstances, the customer protects the research effort,
provides useful feedback during the process, adequately (or
**[generously) funds]{.mark}** the [development]{.mark}, and happily
buys the end product]{.underline}, often helping the developer appeal to
elected leaders for funding. [**The alliance** between the military
customer and private firms]{.underline} selling the innovation [can
overcome the **tendency to free ride** that plagues investment in public
goods]{.underline} such as defense and energy security.

Demand pull to develop major weapons systems is not the only way in
which the United States has innovated for defense, but it is the
principal route to substantial change. At best, other innovation
dynamics, especially technology-push efforts that range from measured
investments to support manufacturing scale-up to the Defense Advanced
Research Project Agency's drive for leap-ahead inventions, tend to yield
small improvements in the performance of deployed systems in the
military's inventory. More often, because technological improvement
itself is rarely sufficient to create demand, inventions derived from
technology-push R&D struggle to find a home on a weapons system:
[Program offices,]{.underline} which actually buy [products and thereby
**create the demand** that justifies building **production-scale
factories**,]{.underline} tend to feel that they would have funded the
R&D themselves, if the invention were really needed to meet their
performance requirements. Bolting on a new technology developed outside
the program also can add technological risk---what if the integration
does not work smoothly?---and program managers shun unnecessary risk.
The partial exceptions are inventions such as stealth, where the
military quickly connected the new technology to high-priority mission
performance.

But [most technology-push projects]{.underline} that succeed yield
small-scale innovations that can matter a great deal at the level of
local organizations but [do not attract **sufficient resources** and
political attention to change overall national
capabilities]{.underline}. In energy innovation, [an]{.underline}
equivalent [example would be a project to develop a **small solar
panel** to contribute to electricity generation at a remote forward
operating base]{.underline}, the sort of boon to warfighters that has
attracted some attention during the Afghanistan War but that contributes
to a relatively low-profile acquisition program (power generation as
opposed to, say, a new expeditionary fighting vehicle) and will not even
command the highest priority for that project's program manager (who
must remain focused on baseload power generation rather than solar
augmentation).

In the more important cases of customer-driven military innovations,
military customers are used to making investment decisions based on
interests other than the pure profit motive. Defense acquisition
requirements derive from leaders' military judgment about the strategic
situation, and [the military gets the funding]{.underline} for needed
research, development, and procurement [from political leaders **rather
than profit-hungry investors**]{.underline}. [This process, along with
the military's]{.underline} relatively [large purse]{.underline} as
compared to even the biggest commercial customers, is precisely what
[attracts]{.underline} the [interest of **advocates** of defense-led
energy innovation]{.underline}: Because of the familiar externalities
and collective action problems in the energy system, [potential energy
innovations often do not promise **a rate of return**]{.underline}
sufficient [to justify the **financial risk** of private R&D
spending]{.underline}, but the people who make defense investments do
not usually calculate financial rates of return anyway.

[A few examples demonstrate the importance of customer preferences in
military innovation]{.underline}. [[When the Navy first started]{.mark}
its]{.underline} Fleet [[B]{.mark}allistic [M]{.mark}issile
program]{.underline}, [its Special Projects Office had]{.underline}
[concepts]{.underline} to give the Navy a role in the nuclear deterrence
mission **[but not much money]{.underline}** initially to develop and
build the Polaris missiles. [[Lockheed]{.mark} understood that
responsiveness was]{.underline} **[a key trait]{.underline}** in the
defense industry[, so the company [**used its own funds**]{.mark}
initially [to support development]{.mark} to the customer's
specifications]{.underline}. As a result, Lockheed won a franchise for
the Navy's strategic systems that continues today in Sunnyvale,
California, more than 50 years later.

In contrast, at roughly the same time as Lockheed's decision to
emphasize responsiveness, [the Curtiss-Wright Corporation]{.underline},
then a huge military aircraft company, [attempted to use]{.underline}
[political channels and promises of great performance to sell
its]{.underline} preferred [jet engine]{.underline} design. However,
[Air Force buyers preferred]{.underline} the products of [companies that
followed the customer's lead]{.underline}, and **[Curtiss-Wright fell
from the ranks]{.underline}** of leading contractors even in a time of
robust defense spending. Today, after great effort and years in the
wilderness, the company has rebuilt to the stature of a mid-tier defense
supplier with a name recognized by most (but not all) defense industry
insiders.

The contrasting experiences of [Lockheed and Curtiss-Wright show
the]{.underline} crucial [importance of **following the customer's
lead**]{.underline} in the U.S. defense market.
[[Entrepreneurs]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[bring]{.mark} what they think
are great [ideas]{.mark} to the DOD]{.underline}, **[[including]{.mark}
ideas for great new [energy technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but
[the department tends to put its money where it wants to]{.underline},
based on its own military judgment.

Although [the U.S. military can be a difficult customer if the
[acquisition executives lose faith]{.mark} [in]{.mark} a **supplier's
[responsiveness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the military can also be a
forgiving customer]{.underline} if firms' good-faith efforts do not
yield products that live up to all of the initial hype, at least for
programs that are important to the Services' core missions. A technology
occasionally underperforms to such an extent that a program is cancelled
(for example, the ill-fated Sergeant York self-propelled antiaircraft
gun of the 1980s) but in many cases, [the military accepts equipment
that does not meet its contractual performance
specifications.]{.underline} [The Services then either nurture the
technology]{.underline} through years of improvements and upgrades or
discover that the system is actually terrific despite failing to meet
the "required" specs. The B-52 bomber is perhaps the paradigm case: It
did not meet its key performance specifications for range, speed, or
payload, but it turned out to be such a successful aircraft that it is
still in use 50 years after its introduction and is expected to stay in
the force for decades to come. The Army similarly stuck with the Bradley
Infantry Fighting Vehicle through a difficult development history.
Trying hard and staying friendly with the customer is the way to succeed
as a defense supplier, and [because the military is committed to seeking
technological solutions]{.underline} to strategic problems, major
**[defense contractors have many opportunities to
innovate]{.underline}**.

This pattern stands in marked contrast to private and municipal
government investment in energy infrastructure, where underperformance
in the short term can sour investors on an idea for decades. The
investors may complete the pilot project, because municipal governments
are not good at cutting their losses after the first phase of costs are
sunk (though corporations may be more ruthless, for example in GM's
telling of the story of the EV-1 electric car). But almost no one else
wants to risk repeating the experience, even if project managers can
make a reasonable case that the follow-on project would perform better
as a result of learning from the first effort.

And it's the government---so politicians play a role

Of course, military desire for a new technology is not sufficient by
itself to get a program funded in the United States. [Strong political
support from key legislators has]{.underline} also [been a prerequisite
for technological innovation]{.underline}. Over the years, the military
and the [defense contractors have learned to combine performance
specifications with political logic]{.underline}. [The best way to
attract political support is to promise **heroic feats of technological
progress**]{.underline}, because the new system should substantially
outperform the equipment in the current American arsenal, even if that
previous generation of equipment was only recently purchased at great
expense. [The political logic simply]{.underline} [compounds the
military's tendency for technological optimism]{.underline}, [creating
**tremendous technology pull**]{.underline}.

In fact, Congress would not spend our tax dollars on the military
without some political payoff, because national security poses a classic
collective action problem. All citizens benefit from spending on
national defense whether they help pay the cost or not, so the
government spends tax dollars rather than inviting people to voluntarily
contribute. But taxes are not popular, and raising money to provide
public goods is a poor choice for a politician unless he can find a
specific political benefit from the spending in addition to furthering
the diffuse general interest.

Military innovations' political appeal prevents the United States from
underinvesting in technological opportunities. Sometimes that appeal
comes from ideology, such as the "religion" that supports missile
defense. Sometimes the appeal comes from an idiosyncratic vision: for
example, a few politicians like Sen. John Warner contributed to keeping
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs alive before 9/11, before the War
on Terror made drone strikes popular. And sometimes the appeal comes
from the ability to feed defense dollars to companies in a legislator's
district. In the UAV case, Rep. Norm Dicks, who had many Boeing
employees in his Washington State district, led political efforts to
continue funding UAV programs after the end of the Cold War.

This need for political appeal presents a major challenge to advocates
of defense-led energy innovation, because the political consensus for
energy innovation is much weaker than the one for military innovation.
Some prominent political leaders, notably Sen. John McCain, have very
publicly questioned whether it is appropriate for the DOD to pay
attention to energy innovation, which they view as a distraction from
the DOD's primary interest in improved warfighting performance. McCain
wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, in July 2012,
criticizing the Navy's biofuels initiative by pointedly reminding
Secretary Mabus, "You are the Secretary of the Navy, not the Secretary
of Energy." Moreover, although almost all Americans agree that the
extreme performance of innovative weapons systems is a good thing
(Americans expect to fight with the very best equipment), government
support for energy innovation, especially energy innovation intended to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, faces strong political headwinds. In
some quarters, ideological opposition to policies intended to reduce
climate change is as strong as the historically important ideological
support for military investment in areas like missile defense.

[The defense industry also provides a key link in assembling the
political support for military innovation]{.underline} that may be hard
to replicate for defense-led energy innovation. The [prime contractors
take charge of **directly organizing district-level political support**
for the defense acquisition budget]{.underline}. [**To be funded**, a
major defense acquisition project needs to fit into a **contractor-led
political strategy**]{.underline}. The prime [contractors]{.underline},
as part of their standard responsiveness to their military customers,
almost instantly [develop a new set of briefing slides to tout how their
products will play an essential role in executing whatever new strategic
concept or buzzword comes from the Pentagon]{.underline}. And their
[lobbyists will make sure that all of the right congressional members
and staffers see those slides]{.underline}. But those trusted
relationships are built on understanding defense technology and on
connections to politicians interested in defense rather than in energy.
There may be limits to the defense lobbyists' ability to redeploy as
supporters of energy innovation.

Other unusual features of the defense market reinforce the especially
strong and insular relationship between military customers and
established suppliers. Their relationship is freighted with strategic
jargon and security classification. Military suppliers are able to
translate the language in which the military describes its vision of
future combat into technical requirements for systems engineering, and
the military trusts them to temper optimistic hopes with technological
realism without undercutting the military's key objectives. Military
leaders feel relatively comfortable informally discussing their
half-baked ideas about the future of warfare with established firms,
ideas that can flower into viable innovations as the military officers
go back and forth with company technologists and financial officers.
That iterative process has given the U.S. military the best equipment in
the world in the past, but it tends to limit the pool of companies to
the usual prime contractors: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman,
Raytheon, General Dynamics, and BAe Systems. Those companies' core
competency is in dealing with the unique features of the military
customer.

Jargon and trust are not the only important features of that
customer-supplier relationship. [Acquisition regulations also specify
high levels of domestic content]{.underline} in defense products,
regardless of the cost; that [a certain fraction of each product will be
built by small businesses and minority- and women-owned
companies]{.underline}, regardless of their ability to win subcontracts
in fair and open competition; and that [defense contractors will comply
with an **extremely intrusive** and **costly set of audit procedures**
to address the threat of perceived or very occasionally real
malfeasanc]{.underline}e. These features of the defense market cannot be
wished away by reformers intent on reducing costs: Each part of the
acquisition system has its defenders, who think that the social goal or
protection from scandal is worth the cost. The defense market differs
from the broader commercial market in the United States on purpose, not
by chance. Majorities think that the differences are driven by good
reasons.

The implication is that [the military has to work with companies that
are comfortable with the terms and conditions of working for the
government]{.underline}. [That constraint **limits the pool** of
potential defense-led energy innovators.]{.underline} It would also
hamper the ability to transfer any defense-led energy innovations to the
commercial market, because successful military innovations have special
design features and extra costs built into their value chain.

In addition to their core competency in understanding the military
customer, defense firms, like most other companies, also have
technological core competencies. In the 1990s and 2000s, it was
fashionable in some circles to call the prime contractors' core
competency "systems integration," as if that task could be performed
entirely independently from a particular domain of technological
expertise. In one of the more extreme examples, Raytheon won the
contract as systems integrator for the LPD-17 class of amphibious ships,
despite its lack of experience as a shipbuilder. Although Raytheon had
for years led programs to develop highly sophisticated shipboard
electronics systems, the company's efforts to lead the team building the
entire ship contributed to an extremely troubled program. In this
example, company and customer both got carried away with their
technological optimism and their emphasis on contractor responsiveness.
In reality, the customer-supplier relationship works best when it calls
for the company to develop innovative products that follow an
established trajectory of technological performance, where the supplier
has experience and core technical capability. Defense companies are
likely to struggle if they try to contribute to technological
trajectories related to energy efficiency or reduced greenhouse gas
emissions, trajectories that have not previously been important in
defense acquisition.

That is not to say that the military cannot introduce new technological
trajectories into its acquisition plans. In fact, [the military's
emphasis on its technological edge has explicitly called for
**disruptive innovation** from time to time, and the defense industry
has responded]{.underline}. For example, the electronics revolution
involved huge changes in technology, shifting from mechanical to
electrical devices and from analog to digital logic, requiring support
from companies with very different technical core competencies. [Startup
companies defined by their intellectual property]{.underline}, though,
[had little insight (or desire) to figure out the complex world of
defense contracting]{.underline}---the military
**[jargon]{.underline}**, the **[trusted relationships]{.underline}**,
the bureaucratic **[red tape]{.underline}**, and the political
byways---so they partnered with established prime contractors.
[Disruptive [innovators became subcontractors]{.mark}, formed joint
ventures, or sold themselves to the primes]{.underline}. [The trick is
for established primes to serve as interfaces]{.underline} and brokers
[to]{.underline} link the military's demand [pull with the right
entrepreneurial companies with skills and processes]{.underline} for the
new performance metrics. Recently, some traditional aerospace prime
contractors, led by Boeing and Northrop Grumman, have used this approach
to compete in the market for unmanned aerial vehicles. Perhaps [they
could do the same in the area of energy innovation.]{.underline}

What the military customer wants

Given the pattern of customer-driven innovation in defense, the task
confronting advocates of defense-driven energy innovation seems
relatively simple: Inject energy concerns into the military requirements
process. If they succeed, then the military innovation route might
directly address key barriers that hamper the normal commercial process
of developing energy technologies. [[With]{.mark} the
[military's]{.mark} [interest]{.mark}, energy [innovations might find
markets that promise a **high enough rate of return** to justify]{.mark}
the [investment]{.mark}, and energy companies might convince financiers
to **stick with projects** through **many lean years** and **false
starts** before they reach technological maturity, commercial
acceptance, and sufficient scale to earn profits.]{.underline}

The first step is to understand the customers' priorities. [From the
perspective of firms that actually develop and sell new defense
technologies,]{.underline} potential [customers include the **military
services** with their various component]{.underline}s, each with a
somewhat different level of interest in energy innovation.

Military organizations decide the emphasis in the acquisition budget.
They make the case, ideally based on military professional judgment, for
the kinds of equipment the military needs most. They also determine the
systems' more detailed requirements, such as the speed needed by a
front-line fighter aircraft and the type(s) of fuel that aircraft should
use. They may, of course, turn out to be wrong: Strategic threats may
suddenly change, some technological advantages may not have the
operational benefits that military leaders expected, or other problems
could emerge in their forecasts or judgments. Nevertheless, these
judgments are extremely influential in defining acquisition
requirements. Admitting uncertainty about requirements often delays a
program: Projects that address a "known" strategic need get higher
priority from military leaders and justify congressional spending more
easily.

Not surprisingly, military buyers almost always want a lot of things.
When they set the initial requirements, before the budget and
technological constraints of actual program execution, the list of
specifications can grow very long. Even though the process in principle
recognizes the need for tradeoffs, there is little to force hard choices
early in the development of a new military technology. Adding an
energy-related requirement would not dramatically change the length of
the list. But when the real spending starts and programs come up for
evaluation milestones, the Services inevitably need to drop some of the
features that they genuinely desired. Relevance to the organizations'
critical tasks ultimately determines the emphasis placed on different
performance standards during those difficult decisions. Even performance
parameters that formally cannot be waived, like those specified in
statute, may face informal pressure for weak enforcement. Programs can
sometimes get a "Gentleman's C" that allows them to proceed,
subordinating a goal that the buying organization thinks is less
important.

Energy technology policy advocates looking for a wealthy investor to
transform the global economy probably ask too much of the DOD.

For example, [[concerns about affordability]{.mark} and interoperability
with allies' systems]{.underline} have traditionally
[[received]{.underline}]{.mark} much more **[rhetorical [emphasis
early]{.mark}]{.underline}** in programs' lives than actual emphasis in
program execution. [When faced with the question of whether to put the
marginal dollar into making the F-22 stealthy and fast or into giving
the F-22 extensive capability to communicate]{.underline}, especially
[with allies]{.underline}, [the program office]{.underline} not
surprisingly **[emphasized the former]{.underline}** key performance
parameters rather than the latter nice feature.

Given that [military leaders]{.underline} naturally emphasize
performance that responds directly to strategic threats, and that they
[are]{.underline} simultaneously [being encouraged by budget austerity
to raise the **relative importance of affordability**]{.underline} in
defense acquisition decisions, energy performance seems more likely to
end up like interoperability than like stealth in the coming tradeoff
deliberations. In a few cases, the energy-related improvements will
directly improve combat performance or affordability, too, but those
true "win-win" solutions are not very common. If they were, there would
be no appeals for special priority for energy innovation.

[The recent case of the **ADVENT jet engine** program shows the
difficulty]{.underline}. [As the military begins procurement of the F-35
fighter for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps as well as for
**international sales**]{.underline}, everyone agrees that having two
options for the engine would be nice. [If Pratt & Whitney's F-135 engine
runs into unexpected production]{.underline} or operational [problems, a
second engine would be available as a backup]{.underline}, and
competition between the two engines would presumably help control costs
and might stimulate further product improvement. However, [the military
decided that the fixed cost of paying GE to develop and manufacture a
second engine would be **too high**]{.underline} to be justified even
for a market as enormous as the F-35 program. [The unofficial political
compromise was to start a **public-private partnership** with GE and
Rolls Royce called []{.mark}ADVENT, which would develop the next
generation of fighter engine]{.underline} that might compete to get onto
F-35 deliveries after 2020. [[ADVENT's]{.mark} headline [target]{.mark}
for performance improvement [is **a 25% reduction in**]{.mark}
**specific [fuel consumption]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which would reduce
operating costs and, more important, would increase the F-35's range and
its ability to loiter over targets, directly contributing to its
warfighting capabilities, especially in the Pacific theater, where
distances between bases and potential targets are long. Although [this
increase in capability seems]{.underline} particularly
[sensible]{.underline}, given the announced U.S. strategy of
"rebalancing" our military toward Asia, [the Air Force has **[struggled
to come up]{.mark} with its share of [funding]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
the public/private partnership [and has hesitated to prepare for a
post-2020 competition]{.underline} between the new engine and the
now-established F-135. The Air Force may have enough to worry about
trying to get the first engine through test and evaluation, and paying
the fixed costs of a future competitor still seems like a luxury in a
time of budget constraint. Countless potential energy innovations have
much weaker strategic logic than the ADVENT engine, and if ADVENT has
trouble finding a receptive buyer, the others are likely to have much
more trouble.

Of course, military culture also offers some hopeful points for the
energy innovation agenda. For example, [even if energy innovation adds
complexity to military logistics in managing a mix of biofuels, or
generating and storing distributed power rather than using standardized
large-capacity diesel generators]{.underline}, the military is actually
good at dealing with complexity. [The Army has always moved **tons of
consumables and countless spare parts** to the front]{.underline} to
feed a vast organization of many different communities (infantry, armor,
artillery, aviation, etc.). [The Navy's power projection capability is
built on a combination of carefully planning]{.underline} what ships
need to take with them with flexible purchasing overseas and underway
replenishment. The old saw that the Army would rather plan than fight
may be an exaggeration, but it holds more than a grain of truth, because
[the Army is genuinely good at planning]{.underline}. More than most
organizations, [the U.S. military is well prepared to deal with the
complexity that energy innovation and field experimentation will inject
into its routines.]{.underline} Even if the logistics system seems
Byzantine and inefficient, the military's organizational culture does
not have antibodies against the complexity that energy innovation might
bring.

Who will support military-led innovation?

The potential for linking energy innovation to the DOD's core mission
seems especially important and exciting right now, because of the recent
experience at war, and even more than that, because the recent wars
happen to have involved a type of fighting with troops deployed to
isolated outposts far from their home bases, in an extreme geography
that stressed the logistics system. But as the U.S. effort in
Afghanistan draws down, energy consumption in operations will account
for less of total energy consumption, meaning that operational energy
innovations will have less effect on energy security. More important,
operational energy innovations will be of less interest to the military
customers, who according to the 2012 Strategic Guidance are not planning
for a repeat of such an extreme situation as the war in Afghanistan.
Even if reality belies their expectations (after all, they did not
expect to deploy to Afghanistan in 2001, either) acquisition investments
follow the ex ante plans, not the ex post reality.

[Specific military organizations that have an interest in preparing to
fight with a light footprint]{.underline} in austere conditions
[may]{.underline} well [continue the operational energy emphasis
of]{.underline} **[the past few years]{.underline}**. [The good news for
advocates of military demand pull for energy innovation is that special
operations forces are viewed as the heroes of the recent wars, making
them politically popular]{.underline}. They also have their own budget
lines that are less likely to be swallowed by more prosaic needs such as
paying for infrastructure at a time of declining defense budgets. [While
the conventional military's attention moves to preparation against a
rising near-peer competitor in China]{.underline} (a possible future, if
not the only one, for U.S. strategic planning), [[spec]{.mark}ial
[op]{.mark}eration[s may]{.mark}]{.underline} still **[[want]{.mark}
lightweight powerful [batteries]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and
solar]{.mark} panels to **bring power far off the grid.**]{.underline}
Even if a lot of special operations procurement buys custom jobs for
highly unusual missions, [the [underlying research]{.mark} to make
special operations equipment [may]{.mark} also [contribute to]{.mark}
**wider commercial uses such as [electric cars]{.mark}** and
**[distributed]{.mark} electricity [generation]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[if not to other challenges like **[infrastructure-scale]{.mark} energy
[storage]{.mark}** and **[grid integration of small]{.mark}-scale
[generators]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Working with industry for defense-led energy innovation requires
treading a fine line. [Advocates need to understand the critical tasks
facing specific military organizations, meaning that they have to live
in the world of **military jargon, strategic thinking, and budget**
politics]{.underline}. At the same time, the advocates need to be able
to reach nontraditional suppliers who have no interest in military
culture but are developing technologies that follow performance
trajectories totally different from those of the established military
systems. More likely, it will not be the advocates who will develop the
knowledge to bridge the two groups, their understandings of their
critical tasks, and the ways they communicate and contract. It will be
the DOD's prime contractors, if their military customers want them to
respond to a demand for energy innovation.

[[Defense]{.mark} really does need some new energy
technologies]{.underline}, ranging [from fuel-efficient jet engines to
easily rechargeable lightweight batteries]{.underline}, and the DOD is
likely to find some money for particular technologies. [Those
technologies [may also **make a difference** for the broader energy
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. But energy technology policy advocates
looking for a wealthy investor to transform the global economy probably
ask too much of the DOD. Military innovations that turn out to have huge
commercial implications---innovations such as the Internet and the
Global Positioning System---do not come along very often, and it takes
decades before their civilian relatives are well understood and widely
available. The military develops these products because of its own
internal needs, driven by military judgment, congressional budget
politics, and the core competencies of defense-oriented industry.

In a 2014 report, the Pew Project on National Security, Energy and
Climate Change blithely discussed the need to "chang\[e\] the
\[military\] culture surrounding how energy is generated and used...."
Trying to change the way the military works drives into the teeth of
military and political resistance to defense-led energy innovation.
Changing the culture might also undermine the DOD's ability to innovate;
after all, one of the key reasons why Pew and others are interested in
using the defense acquisition apparatus for energy innovation is that
mission-focused technology development at the DOD has been so successful
in the past. Better to focus defense-led energy innovation efforts on
projects that actually align with military missions rather than
stretching the boundaries of the concept and weakening the overall
effort.

#### Warming causes extinction, but [tech]{.underline} can solve 

**Wallace-Wells 17** -- Deputy Editor NY Magazine, National Fellow New
America \[David, July 10, *New York Magazine*, "The Uninhabitable Earth,
Annotated Edition",
<http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans-annotated.html?gtm=bottom&gtm=top>,
accessed 2/1/19\]

We published "The Uninhabitable Earth" on Sunday night, and the response
since has been extraordinary --- both in volume (it is already the
most-read article in New York Magazine's history) and in kind. Within
hours, the article spawned a fleet of commentary across newspapers,
magazines, blogs, and Twitter, much of which came from climate
scientists and the journalists who cover them.

Some of this conversation has been about the factual basis for various
claims that appear in the article. To address those questions, and to
give all readers more context for how the article was reported and what
further reading is available, we are publishing here a version of the
article filled with research annotations. They include quotations from
scientists I spoke with throughout the reporting process; citations to
scientific papers, articles, and books I drew from; additional research
provided by my colleague Julia Mead; and context surrounding some of the
more contested claims. Since the article was published, we have made
four corrections and adjustments, which are noted in the annotations (as
well as at the end of the original version). They are all minor, and
none affects the central project of the story: to apply the best science
we have today to the median and high-end "business-as-usual" warming
projections produced by the U.N.'s "gold standard" Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change.

But the debate this article has kicked up is less about specific facts
than the article's overarching conceit. Is it helpful, or
journalistically ethical, to explore the worst-case scenarios of climate
change, however unlikely they are? How much should a writer
contextualize scary possibilities with information about how probable
those outcomes are, however speculative those probabilities may be? What
are the risks of terrifying or depressing readers so much they disengage
from the issue, and what should a journalist make of those risks?

I hope, in the annotations and commentary below, I have added some
context. But I also believe very firmly in the set of propositions that
animated the project from the start: that [the public does not
appreciate the scale of climate risk]{.underline}; that this is in part
because we have not spent enough time contemplating the scarier half of
the distribution curve of possibilities, especially its brutal long
tail, or the risks beyond sea-level rise; that there is journalistic and
public-interest value in spreading the news from the scientific
community, no matter how unnerving it may be; and that, [when it comes
to the challenge of climate change, public complacency is a far, **far
bigger problem** than widespread fatalism]{.underline} --- that many,
many more people are not scared enough than are already "too scared." In
fact, I don't even understand what "too scared" would mean. The science
says [climate change threatens]{.underline} nearly [every aspect of
human life]{.underline} on this planet, and that inaction will hasten
the problems. In that context, I don't think it's a slur to call an
article, or its writer, alarmist. I'll accept that characterization.
**[We should be alarmed]{.underline}**.

I. 'Doomsday'

Peering beyond scientific reticence.

It is, I promise, worse than you think. If your anxiety about [global
warming]{.underline} is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are
barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible, even within
the lifetime of a teenager today. And yet the swelling seas --- and the
[cities]{.underline} they **[will drown]{.underline}** --- have so
dominated the picture of global warming, and so overwhelmed our capacity
for climate panic, that they have occluded our perception of other
threats, many much closer at hand. Rising oceans are bad, in fact very
bad; but fleeing the coastline will not be enough.

Indeed, absent a significant adjustment to how billions of humans
conduct their lives, parts of the [[Earth]{.underline}
[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[become]{.underline}]{.mark} close to
**[[uninhabitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and other parts horrifically
inhospitable, [as soon as the **end of this century**]{.underline}. The
most credible prediction of the effects of climate change comes from the
U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which issues regular
reports synthesizing the latest science. The [IPCC's median
business-as-usual projection]{.underline} for warming by 2100
[is]{.underline} about **[four degrees]{.underline}**, which would
expose half the world's population to unprecedented heat stress,
according to Steven C. Sherwood and Matthew Huber's landmark study on
the subject. "I haven't learned anything since publishing that paper,"
Sherwood, a professor at UNSW Sydney, Kensington, told me. "It looks to
me that at that those numbers --- four to six degrees --- you'd start to
see the tropics evacuating, because people wouldn't be able to live
there. It might be less than four degrees. But around four degrees or
five degrees, would be the point where people would be finding it
unbearable." It wouldn't just be heat stress driving people away, he
said. "A combination of heat stress and other things. I think
[you'd]{.underline} start to **[see crop failures]{.underline}**, damage
to the biosphere. Keep in mind, in the tropics, two or three degrees
takes the environment outside the range of natural variability." As
Richard Alley of Pennsylvania State University told me, "under rapid
emissions, by the end of the century, 40 percent of the ability of
people to work outside would be lost." How likely is this median,
"business-as-usual" outcome? It's difficult to say, unfortunately, given
how many and how variable the inputs would be for any projections:
emissions rates, the pace of technological change, cultural changes, and
public policy, all on top of what is already a quite complicated (and
not entirely understood) natural system that delivers both amplifying
and moderating feedbacks to human-produced greenhouse-gas effects. In
some ways, it is easiest to talk about that business-as-usual model,
because it holds so many of those variables constant. But, since a
number of readers have wondered about those probabilities, I'll mention
a couple of estimates that seemed helpful, to me, in establishing the
general lay of the land. In my interview with Michael Oppenheimer, of
Princeton, he told me that he'd estimate our chances of staying below
the Paris accord's goal of two-degrees warming at 10 percent. In my
interview with Wallace Smith Broecker, of Columbia, he mentioned some
research he'd followed whereby researchers ran a single model many, many
times to generate a range of probabilities; "The mean was about 3.5
degrees Celsius of warming," he told me. "But it showed there was
something like 15 percent probability that it'd be more than four
degrees, just on these model runs." And in their book Climate Shock: The
Economic Consequences of a Hotter Planet, Gernot Wagner and Martin
Weitzman estimate a 15 percent chance that we overshoot six degrees.

These models make a variety of assumptions, both about natural systems
and manmade response, but collectively they do suggest, to me at least,
that we have been far too focused on the optimistic possibilities (which
bring us to 2100 at or under two degrees warming) and not nearly focused
enough on the more dire ones. As Joseph Romm wrote in Climate Change:
What Everyone Needs to Know, "Any time this book or any news report
cites an IPCC projection of future warming or future climate impacts, it
is almost certain that projection represents an underestimate of what is
to come."

Even when we train our eyes on climate change, we are unable to
comprehend its scope. This past winter, [a string of days 60 and 70
degrees warmer]{.underline} than normal [**baked** **the North
Pole**,]{.underline}"This is a little bit shocking," Ketil Isaksen of
the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said of the temperatures. melting
the permafrost "When we built the seed vault, there was not even
discussion of the permafrost," Hege Njaa Aschim, the press
representative of the organization that oversees the project, told me.
But the weather last winter, she said, was "like a Norwegian summer."
"We didn't come up with the term doomsday vault," Cary Fowler, the
mastermind of the seed vault, told me. "The idea there was to provide an
insurance policy, so if anything were to happen to those other
facilities, it wouldn't be an extinction event." that encased Norway's
Svalbard seed vault --- a global food bank nicknamed "Doomsday,"
designed to ensure that our agriculture survives any catastrophe, and
which appeared to have been flooded by climate change less than ten
years after being built.

The Doomsday vault is fine, for now: The structure has been secured and
the seeds are safe.Fowler was emphatic on this point to me --- there had
been a wave of press coverage that presented the flooding as something
catastrophic, rather than a breach that let meltwater in just 15 or 20
meters down a much-longer tunnel that leads from the exterior of the
mountain into the seed vault's "cathedral" room, from which the storage
facilities fan. But treating the episode as a parable of impending
flooding missed the more important news. Until recently, permafrost was
not a major concern of climate scientists, because, as the name
suggests, it was soil that stayed permanently frozen. But Arctic
permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon,In this paper, it's
calculated by petagrams; 1,672 petagrams is about 1.8 trillion tons.
more than twice as muchThis is from Joseph Romm's Climate Change, page
81 (in the paperback edition). The book was an invaluable resource in
researching this article, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested
in picking up where this piece leaves off. as is currently suspended in
the Earth's atmosphere. When it thaws and is released, that carbon may
evaporate as methane, which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas
warming blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a
century; when judged on the timescale of two decades, it is 86 times as
powerful.This is also from Romm, also page 81. You can read more about
methane's greenhouse effects here. In other words, we have, trapped in
Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the
atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date
that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that
multiplies its warming power 86 times over.There has been a fair amount
of criticism of my use of this material. Michael Mann in particular has
faulted me for it; in his initial Facebook post about the story, he
wrote that "the science doesn't support the notion of a game-changing,
planet-melting methane bomb." At Climate Feedback, several other
scientists took issue with various aspects of my characterization as
well. ¶ There is little doubt that this permafrost is melting quickly.

According to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment, by 2100, "it is virtually
certain that near-surface permafrost extent at high northern latitudes
will be reduced as global mean surface temperature increases, with the
area of permafrost near the surface (upper 3.5 m) projected to decrease
by 37% (RCP2.6) to 81% (RCP8.5) for the multi-model average." But there
is some important context I did not include here: Few scientists believe
there is a substantial risk of methane release from permafrost happening
suddenly, or all at once.

Also, most of the carbon will likely escape as C02, not methane. In
retrospect, I sympathize with those who find misleading the phrase "all
of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up."
The schedule I was referring to was the melting, which will take
decades; the thawing is a process, not an event. ¶ I believe that my
original description of the possibility of the methane release lacked
some relevant (reassuring) context.

But I do not believe the science was fundamentally misrepresented here:
There is that much carbon in [the]{.underline} permafrost; the
[[permafrost is]{.mark} melting at accelerating rates]{.underline}; some
of the [carbon will be released as methane]{.underline}; and [methane is
a stronger greenhouse gas than carbon d]{.underline}ioxide. ¶ My
intention in referencing the permafrost was to illustrate, for readers
unfamiliar with the particulars of projection models, how many uncertain
factors were at play --- how many forces we don't understand, and how
possibly significant those forces could be in the warming of the planet.
As Joseph Romm writes, "The [thawing tundra or permafrost]{.underline}
[may]{.underline} well [be [the]{.mark} single [most
important]{.mark}]{.underline} **[amplifying carbon-cycle
[feedback]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Yet, none of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change's climate models include carbon dioxide or
methane emissions from warming tundra as a feedback." He also writes, "A
2011 study by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
and the National Snow and Ice Data Center found that thawing permafrost
will turn the Arctic from a place that stores carbon (a sink) to a place
that generates carbon (a source) in the 2020s---and release a hundred
billion tons of carbon by 2100." That study, he says, assumes none of
the carbon will be released as methane, and yet still predicts a release
"equivalent to half the amount of carbon that has been released into the
atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial age." ¶ To be additionally
clear, none of the warming scenarios described in the remainder of this
article are built on the premise of a methane release from permafrost.
They all extrapolate from the median and high-end IPCC projections for
business-as-usual warming.

Even if you take issue with my characterization of the threat from
permafrost melt, it does not affect my discussion of any of the risks
that follow. The permafrost melt is a wild card which could add to those
IPCC projections. (Romm calculates it could add a degree of warming by
2100 all on its own.) ¶ For those who are really interested in reading
about methane, there are also the clathrates to consider --- bubbles of
methane at the bottom of the ocean, which many energy companies are now
hoping to mine. Speaking about those with me, Lee Kump, a Penn State
geoscientist, had this to say: "We haven't really anticipated these
positive feedbacks --- for instance, these pockets of methane. That
methane starts bubbling out, that's a potent greenhouse gas. As that
spreads throughout the globe, there's a tremendous potential there for
methane hydrates release." He went on: "As you move towards the poles,
we're already seeing the consequences of warming there in terms of
methane release."

Maybe you know that already --- there are alarming stories in the news
every day, like those, last month, that seemed to suggest satellite data
showed the globe warming since 1998 more than twice as fast as
scientists had thought (in fact, the underlying story was considerably
less alarming than the headlines).This reference to recent, alarming
news generated a fair amount of pushback among scientists. We've
adjusted the text to make clear that, while many outlets did describe
the study in these terms --- in the Washington Post, for instance:
"Satellite temperature data, leaned on sharply by climate change
doubters, revised sharply upward") --- the actual news was much less
dramatic. There was satellite data that was revised upward, but it was
data that had been previously interpreted to be below estimates and
adjacent data sets, and was revised to bring it more or less into line
with those estimates and data sets (that is, it did not change the
big-picture assessment of how fast the planet was warming). In general,
I agree with this characterization, by Carl Mears, who wrote the study:
"This sentence is true for RSS data," he told Climate Feedback. "But
it's somewhat misleading due to lack of context." The paper on which the
news was based can be found here. Or the news from Antarctica this past
May, when a crack in an ice shelf grew 11 miles in six days, then kept
going; the break now has just three miles to go --- by the time you read
this, it may already have met the open water, where it will drop into
the sea one of the biggest icebergs ever, a process known poetically as
"calving."As readers have pointed out, there is a debate within the
scientific community about whether this calving is a natural process or
the result of climate change. In either case, it is alarming news, given
that the ice now loosed into the ocean will melt faster. And, of course,
the calving has since occurred.

But no matter how well-informed you are, [you are surely not alarmed
enough]{.underline}. Over the past decades, our culture has gone
apocalyptic with zombie movies and Mad Max dystopias, perhaps the
collective result of displaced climate anxiety, and yet when it comes to
contemplating real-world warming dangers, we suffer from an incredible
failure of imagination. The [reasons]{.underline} for that [are
many]{.underline}: [the]{.underline} [timid language of scientific
probabilities]{.underline}, which the climatologist James Hansen once
called "scientific reticence". That paper can be found here.

Hansen spoke about this with me: "[You're rewarded in science for not
stepping out too rapidly]{.underline}," he said. in a paper chastising
[scientists]{.underline} for editing their own observations so
conscientiously that they [failed to communicate]{.underline} [**how
dire** the threat really was]{.underline}; the fact that the country is
dominated by a group of technocrats who believe any problem can be
solved and an opposing culture that doesn't even see warming as a
problem worth addressing; the way that climate denialism has made
scientists even more cautious in offering speculative warnings; the
simple speed of change and, also, its slowness, such that we are only
seeing effects now of warming from decades pastHansen also spoke about
this with me: "The fundamental difficulty is the delayed response ---
the inertia of the climate system. The ocean is deep and the ice sheets
are three kilometers thick, and they don't respond quickly to what is
really a weak forcing. And so the system has only partially responded to
the forcing we've put up already.

There's more in the pipeline. You're talking about a system that
responds on the timescale of decades to centuries --- that's a different
time constant than the political constant." ; our uncertainty about
uncertainty, which the climate writer Naomi Oreskes in particular has
suggested stops us from preparing as though anything worse than a median

found here. ; the way we assume climate change will hit hardest
elsewhere, not everywhere; the smallness (two degreesThis is the warming
target, in Celsius, of the Paris climate accord agreement. ) and
largeness (1.8 trillion tonsThis is the amount of carbon in the
permafrost (see note No. 8). ) and abstractness (400 parts per
millionThis is the current concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. ) of
the numbers; the discomfort of considering a problem that is very
difficult, if not impossible, to solve; the altogether incomprehensible
scale of that problem, which amounts to the prospect of our own
annihilation; simple fear. But aversion arising from fear is a form of
denial, too.

In between scientific reticence and science fiction is science itself.
[[This article]{.underline} [is the result of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[dozens of [interviews and exchanges with climatologists]{.mark} and
researchers in related fields and reflects **[hundreds of scientific
papers]{.mark}** on the subject of climate change. What follows
is]{.underline} not a series of predictions of what will happen --- that
will be determined in large part by the much-less-certain science of
human response. Instead, it is [a portrait of our]{.underline} best
[understanding of where the planet is heading]{.underline} absent
aggressive action. It is unlikely that all of these warming scenarios
will be fully realized, largely because the devastation along the way
will shake our complacency. But those scenarios, and not the present
climate, are the baseline. In fact, **[they are our
schedule]{.underline}**.These five sentences were the focal point of
much of the debate among scientists surrounding this piece: Were they
explicit enough to explain to readers that this article would be a tour
of worst-case scenarios, and was not intended to be read as a prediction
of likely outcomes? And furthermore, was such a worst-case-scenario tour
irresponsible, given that they are not the most likely scenarios? For
some of the most thoughtful commentary on all sides of the debate, I
recommend reading the essays by Susan Matthews, David Roberts, and
Robinson Meyer.

The present tense of climate change --- the destruction we've already
baked into our future --- is horrifying enough.Joseph Romm, in Climate
Change: "Many cornerstone elements of our climate began changing far
faster than most scientists had projected. The Arctic began losing sea
ice several decades ahead of every single climate model used by the
IPCC, which in turn means the Arctic region warmed up even faster than
scientists expected. At the same time, the great ice sheets of Greenland
and Antarctica, which contain enough water to raise sea levels
ultimately 25--80 meters (80--260 feet), have begun disintegrating 'a
century ahead of schedule,' as Richard Alley, a leading climatologist
put it in 2005. In 2014 and 2015, we learned that both ice sheets are
far less stable than we realized, and they are dangerously close to
tipping points that would lead to irreversible collapse and dramatic
rates of sea level rise." Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh
still have a chance of surviving; most of the scientists I spoke with
assume we'll lose them within the century, even if we stop burning
fossil fuel in the next decade.Peter Ward told me Bangladesh is
"doomed": "The worst place on earth has to be Bangladesh, because it's
not just the covering, it's the sideways salt problem that will doom
them.The scary thing is that, the direct cover is what people cite, but
they ignore, to date, the sideways infiltration of salt. And this,
again, just a slight rise in sea level causes a huge problem. And, as
you know, as the sea level rises, it's like a diving board for storm
surge. You're causing storm surge to jump ever further inland, and that
in itself means huge inundation --- it doesn't have to be the rise to
destroy the crops. It's just a bad, bad situation. Bangladesh --- you
cover it up, where are those people going to go?" ¶ In Bangladesh, 40
percent of land is projected to be lost with just 65 centimeters (just
over two feet) sea-level rise. Could some of this flooding be avoided if
the world zeroed out emissions immediately and entirely (if the Paris
accords legislated 100 percent carbon-neutral energy and industry and
land use)? Some, possibly. But one 2012 study by Climate Analytics
suggested that even if the planet eliminated emissions entirely by 2016
a best-possible-case outcome would be sea-level rise of 59 centimeters
by 2100 --- just about exactly that two feet of rise that would cover 40
percent of the country. ¶ A few of the other scientists I spoke with
weren't quite as definitive as Ward, but in general agreed that no
plausible emissions-reduction regime could stop the planet from reaching
about 1.5 degrees warming by the end of the century, which will produce
some quite problematic sea-level effect. "Forty or 50 years from now
we'll be at doubled carbon dioxide," Wallace Smith Broecker told me.
"And that will be away above --- we may not be above two degrees at that
point, because the ocean is sucking up a lot of heat, and we have to
heat up the ocean. And that's one thing --- the melting of the ice. Of
course that involves almost all the major cities in the world, which are
on the ocean. Bangladesh and Florida and so forth." That same two-foot
sea-level rise would increase flooding in Miami Beach and other Miami
barrier islands about a hundredfold, according to Doug Marcy of the
NOAA, working from data centered on nearby Virginia Key. Here is one
good report on the threat to Miami and South Florida generally. Two
degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of catastrophe:
tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an unprepared
world.James Hansen has been especially vocal about the risks of a
two-degrees-warmer world. Now two degrees is our goal, per the Paris
climate accords, and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it.For
instance, this expert. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change issues serial reports, often called the "gold standard" of
climate research; the most recent one projects us to hit four degrees of
warming by the beginning of the next century, should we stay the present
course. But that's just a median projection. The upper end of the
probability curve runs as high as eight degreesSee the U.N,'s Summary
for Policymakers. --- and the authors still haven't figured out how to
deal with that permafrost melt. The IPCC reports also don't fully
account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more
absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps
heat)At Climate Feedback, Ted Letcher calls this a "gross
oversimplification." However, he goes on to say that, "The IPCC report
does generally show a net positive cloud feedback, indicating global
cloud feedbacks will lead to additional warming." ; or the dieback of
forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere).Some
of these effects are included in the IPCC reports, but this assessment
of how fully they've been incorporated comes from a fact-checking
conversation with Michael Oppenheimer (separate from the original
reporting interview). Oppenheimer is not only one of the world's leading
authorities on climate change, he has also been closely involved through
the years with the IPCC project. Some scientists have argued that the
IPCC has modeled some of these effects, and they are correct in the
sense that the reports include many, many divergent models, emphasized
to different degrees and given different amounts of prominence in their
reports. But on the question of just how fully those reports account for
these effects, I'm with Oppenheimer. Each of these promises to
accelerate warming,As some scientists have pointed out, there are also
feedback loops that work in the opposite direction, though they are
generally considered to be less powerful, so that the net effect remains
"positive" (that is, amplifying warming). As Joseph Romm points out, "In
2011, Science published a major review, 'Lessons from Earth's Past,'
which suggested that carbon dioxide 'may have at least twice the effect
on global temperatures than currently projected by computer models.'"
and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much
as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years.This phrase has been
updated to more accurately reflect the rate of warming during the
Paleocene--Eocene Thermal Maximum. The last time the planet was even
four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World,
his new history of the planet's major extinction events,Brannen's book
is a very engaging way into the history of mass extinctions (and he was
a very helpful interview, too). This sentence was updated to correct a
reference to Brannen's book. the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.\*

The Earth has experienced five mass extinctionsHere is an even shorter
way into the history. before the one we are living through now,In their
book Dire Predictions, Michael Mann and Lee Kump estimate that four
degrees of warming would eliminate between 40 and 70 percent of the
world's species. At 2.2 degrees, we'd lose between 15 and 37 percent.
each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned
as a resetting of the planetary clock,"To me, the mass extinctions were
really interesting in terms of what happens after them --- we have this
dead period, and the recovery fauna is totally different," Peter Ward
told me. "And that leads to the idea of, Gee, how much longer will the
recovery be if we have an extinction now?" and many climate scientists
will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are
diving headlong into."To find analogue worlds for the future, we have to
go way back in Earth's history," Lee Kump told me. "Each of these
events, including the modern situation, starts with a trigger. In the
past it's been a volcanic eruption, now it's fossil-fuel burning, but
it's a very analogous perturbation to the system. But then it's
amplified by hidden feedbacks that get activated from the initial
warming, and bring that warming even further." Unless you are a
teenager, you probably read in your high-school textbooks that these
extinctions were the result of asteroids. In fact, all but the one that
killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by
greenhouse gas."Impact was key, and king, for the 1980s and 1990s ---
every one of the big extinctions was attributed to impact," Peter Ward
told me. "But it became clear that, in fact, no, these were not impact
extinctions. We had to invent a new term. I don't know who came up with
it first, but I was in there pretty early calling them greenhouse
extinctions. And this new paradigm started coming into play. We're even
starting to see that K--T \[the extinction that killed off the
dinosaurs\] also has a greenhouse component --- because there was
warming right at the impact." The most notorious was 252 million years
ago; it began when carbon warmed the planet by five degrees, accelerated
when that warming triggered the release of methane in the Arctic, and
ended with 97 percent of all life on Earth dead.For more about the
end-Permian mass extinction, see this National Geographic article, this
article from Phys.org, and my interview with Peter Ward. In Climate
Feedback's scientist survey, Lee Kump took issue with my description of
the role of methane in the end-Permian extinction: "Whether methane was
released remains speculative, although not unlikely." Speaking about the
same extinction event to me, he was much less equivocal: "That was
triggered by volcanic eruption --- in this case in Siberia, one of the
biggest volcanic events of all time. And that had the predictable
effects --- release of CO2, methane, and ultimately mass extinctions."
We are currently adding carbon to the atmosphere at a considerably
faster rate; by most estimates, at least ten times faster."Maximum rates
of carbon emissions for both the PETM and the end-Permian is about 1
billion tons of carbon, and right now we're at 10 billion tons of
carbon," Lee Kump told me. "The duration of both of those events was
much longer than fossil-fuel burning will go on, and so the total amount
is lower --- but not by a factor of ten. By a factor of two or three."
According to the World Bank, "The present CO2 concentration is higher
than paleoclimatic and geologic evidence indicates has occurred at any
time in the last 15 million years." The rate is accelerating."It's going
completely in the wrong direction, with no sign that the planet as a
whole has the problem under control," Kevin Trenberth, a senior
scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told Inside
Climate News. As Joseph Romm puts it, "The current rate of increase in
global warming is roughly the same as detonating 400,000 Hiroshima bombs
per day, 365 days per year." This is what Stephen Hawking had in mind
when he said, this spring, that the species needs to colonize other
planets in the next century to survive, and what drove Elon Musk, last
month, to unveil his plans to build a Mars habitat in 40 to 100 years.
These are nonspecialists, of course, and probably as inclined to
irrational panic as you or I. But the many sober-minded scientists I
interviewed over the past several months --- the most credentialed and
tenured in the field, few of them inclined to alarmism and many advisers
to the IPCC who nevertheless criticize its conservatism --- have quietly
reached an apocalyptic conclusion, too: No plausible program of
emissions reductions alone can prevent climate disaster.See, for
instance, my interviews with James Hansen and Wallace Smith Broecker.

Over the past few decades, the term "Anthropocene" has climbed out of
academic discourse and into the popular imagination --- a name given to
the geologic era we live in now, and a way to signal that it is a new
era, defined on the wall chart of deep history by human intervention.
One problem with the term is that it implies a conquest of nature (and
even echoes the biblical "dominion"). And however sanguine you might be
about the proposition that we have already ravaged the natural world,
which we surely have, it is another thing entirely to consider the
possibility that we have only provoked it, engineering first in
ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war
with us for many centuries, perhaps until it destroys us. That is what
Wallace Smith Broecker, the avuncular oceanographer who coined the term
"global warming," means when he calls the planet an "angry beast.""The
climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks." You
could also go with "war machine." Each day we arm it more.

II\. Heat Death

The bahraining of New York.

In the sugar­cane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth of the
population has chronic kidney disease, the presumed result of
dehydration from working the fields they were able to comfortably
harvest as recently as two decades ago. Photo: Heartless Machine

Humans, like all mammals, are heat engines; surviving means having to
continually cool off, like panting dogs. For that, the temperature needs
to be low enough for the air to act as a kind of refrigerant, drawing
heat off the skin so the engine can keep pumping. At seven degrees of
warming, that would become impossible for large portions of the planet's
equatorial band, and especially the tropics, where humidity adds to the
problemThis is from the landmark paper on the subject, by Steven C.
Sherwood and Matthew Huber. ; in the jungles of Costa Rica, for
instance, where humidity routinely tops 90 percent, simply moving around
outside when it's over [[105 degrees]{.mark} Fahrenheit [would be
**lethal**]{.mark}.]{.underline} You can use this rough
wet-bulb-temperature calculator to explore other circumstances. And the
effect would be fast: [Within a few hours, [a human body would be
**cooked**]{.mark} **to death** from both inside and out.]{.underline}
This is based on research by Sherwood, which can be found here.

Climate-change skeptics point out that the planet has warmed and cooled
many times before, but the climate window that has allowed for human
life is very narrow, even by the standards of planetary history. At 11
or 12 degrees of warming, more than half the world's population, as
distributed today, would die of direct heat.Sherwood and Huber again.
Things almost certainly won't get that hot this century, though models
of unabated emissions do bring us that far eventually."One of the
problems in the IPCC is that they only want to focus on what happens in
the year 2100. If you go out to 2300, it's not hard to get past six
degrees --- half the models do that," Sherwood told me by phone. Later,
by email, he added: "Several of the models run for the last IPCC report
eventually reach more than 10C of warming under a no-mitigation scenario
(though not until the next century or the one after). You could say it
is unlikely. Most models eventually exceed 6C though, so this is
actually unlikely \*not\* to happen without mitigation!" This century,
and especially in the tropics, the pain points will pinch much more
quickly even than an increase of seven degrees. The key factor is
something called wet-bulb temperature, which is a term of measurement as
home-laboratory-kit as it sounds: the heat registered on a thermometer
wrapped in a damp sock as it's swung around in the air (since the
moisture evaporates from a sock more quickly in dry air, this single
number reflects both heat and humidity). At present, most regions reach
a wet-bulb maximum of 26 or 27 degrees Celsius; the true red line for
habitability is 35 degrees. What is called heat stress comes much
sooner.Sherwood and Huber again.

Actually, we're about there already. Since 1980, the planet has
experienced a 50-fold increase in the number of places experiencing
dangerous or extreme heatThe original paper is by James Hansen, though
for this and much of my account of extreme heat events I relied on
Joseph Romm's Climate Change. ; a bigger increase is to come. The five
warmest summers in Europe since 1500 have all occurred since 2002,This
is from the World Bank's very helpful 2012 report Turn Down the Heat, on
life in a world four degrees warmer. and soon, the IPCC warns, simply
being outdoors that time of year will be unhealthy for much of the
globe.The warning appears on page 15 of the Fifth Assessment's Synthesis
Report. As some readers have pointed out, these effects will come about
gradually, beginning with the rare unusually hot day; those unusually
hot days will gradually become more frequent in number. As with all of
the climate effects in this article, it's important to remember that
heat stress is not a binary matter: It's not that there are two options,
lethal heat waves and normal, comfortable temperatures, but that global
warming will gradually bring about more and more heat stress. The same
is true, of course, for effects on agriculture, economics, conflict, and
other areas. As Richard Alley told me, "We've warmed the world one
degree. The general impression is that each degree is more costly, more
damaging, than the previous one. The first degree --- most estimates are
that the first degree was almost free. But we can see a dotted line into
Syria. The second degree will cost more than the first degree. You might
say it costs the square of the warming." Even if we meet the Paris goals
of two degrees warming, cities like Karachi and Kolkata will become
close to uninhabitable, annually encountering deadly heat waves like
those that crippled them in 2015."Even if such aspirations are realized,
large increases in the frequency of deadly heat should be expected, with
more than 350 million more megacity inhabitants afflicted by
midcentury," this paper warns. At four degrees, [the deadly European
heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a
day]{.underline}, **[will be a normal summer]{.underline}**. Also from
Turn Down the Heat. At six, according to an assessment focused only on
effects within the U.S. from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the
lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the
Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the
world today.The report can be found here. As Joseph Romm has put it in
his authoritative primer Climate Change: What Everyone Needs to Know,
heat stress in New York City would exceed that of present-day Bahrain,
one of the planet's hottest spots, and the temperature in Bahrain "would
induce hyperthermia in even sleeping humans."This is from page 138,
though it refers to the same NOAA study mentioned above. The high-end
IPCC estimate, remember, is two degrees warmer still. By the end of the
century, the World Bank has estimated, the coolest months in tropical
South America, Africa, and the Pacific are likely to be warmer than the
warmest months at the end of the 20th century.See Turn Down the Heat.
Air-conditioning can help but will ultimately only add to the carbon
problem; plus, the climate-controlled malls of the Arab emirates aside,
it is not remotely plausible to wholesale air-condition all the hottest
parts of the world, many of them also the poorest.The
air-conditioning/carbon trade-off is especially acute in developing
countries. And indeed, the crisis will be most dramatic across the
Middle East and Persian Gulf, where in 2015 the heat index registered
temperatures as high as 163 degrees Fahrenheit.This was in Iran. As soon
as several decades from now, the hajj will become physically impossible
for the 2 million Muslims who make the pilgrimage each year.This study,
by Jeremy S. Pal and Elfatih A. B. Eltahir, was also written about in
the New York Times.

It is not just the hajj, and it is not just Mecca; heat is already
killing us. In the sugarcane region of El Salvador, as much as one-fifth
of the population has chronic kidney disease, including over a quarter
of the men, the presumed result of dehydration from working the fields
they were able to comfortably harvest as recently as two decades ago.A
good account of this phenomenon appeared in Australia's The Age (flagged
for me by Steven Sherwood). With dialysis, which is expensive, those
with kidney failure can expect to live five years; without it, life
expectancy is in the weeks."Average life expectancy on dialysis is 5--10
years," the National Kidney Foundation estimates. Of course, heat stress
promises to pummel us in places other than our kidneys, too. As I type
that sentence, in the California desert in mid-June, it is 121 degrees
outside my door.This was in Palm Springs. It is not a record high.But
close.

III\. The End of Food

Praying for cornfields in the tundra.

Climates differ and plants vary, but the basic rule for staple cereal
crops grown at optimal temperature is that [[for every degree]{.mark} of
warming, [yields decline by **10 percent**]{.mark}]{.underline}.The
major paper on this subject is by David S. Battisti and Rosamond L.
Naylor. Some estimates run as high as 15 or even 17 percent."Under
optimal conditions --- these are controlled plots, where they have
irrigation and pesticides --- you get this kind of typical, between 10
percent and 17 percent decline for every degree Celsius of increase,"
David Battisti told me. "But people will say, 'What about the carbon
fertilization?'" That has been thought to aid plant growth, a kind of
airborne fertilizer. "Everything I've seen about [[CO2
fertilization]{.underline}]{.mark} --- none of it **[[is]{.mark}
[helpful for grains]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It might be helpful for
biomass, but it's not helpful for grains. And so, yeah, [if you want to
eat the leaves of the wheat plant, it might be okay. But if you want to
eat the wheat, it's not necessarily good]{.underline}." Which means that
if the planet is five degrees warmer at the end of the century, we may
have as many as 50 percent more people to feed and 50 percent less grain
to give them.In my interview with Battisti, I suggested this arithmetic:
four or five degrees warming means 50 or 60 percent drop in yields, for
a population that will be 50 to 75 percent higher. "That's right, that's
right," he said. "Yup, yup. And there are some things you could do. You
could have some of these countries develop and not turn to a meat diet,
which would help a little bit. Obviously, when people get wealthier
their diet shifts more to a meat diet, which means you need grain to
feed cows and pigs and chickens. And every country --- even India is
shifting to be more meat consumption per person, though it's a small
shift because of religious reasons, but every other country lies on the
same curve. As the income goes up, the consumption of meat goes up.

Which means the demand for grains will go through the roof." And
proteins are worse: It takes 16 calories of grain to produce just a
single calorie of hamburger meat,Battisti: "There are these
seed-conversion rates that range from a factor of--- very low is three,
three kilograms of protein that you feed a fish for one kilogram you get
out of it. For beef, it's ten. And, you end up with massive amounts of
grain to feed pigs and chickens." butchered from a cow that spent its
life polluting the climate with methane farts.Cows both burp and fart
methane, although the burps are actually worse; National Geographic
recently wrote that cow burps are responsible for 26 percent of U.S.
methane release.

Pollyannaish plant physiologists will point out that the cereal-crop
math applies only to those regions already at peak growing temperature,
and they are right --- theoretically, a warmer climate will make it
easier to grow corn in Greenland. But as the pathbreaking work by
Rosamond Naylor and David Battisti has shown, the tropics are already
too hot to efficiently grow grain, and those places where grain is
produced today are already at optimal growing temperature --- which
means even a small warming will push them down the slope of declining
productivity."If you're beyond the optimal temperature, as in the
tropics, as you increase temperature, yields decline," Battisti said.
"In the mid-latitudes, people haven't worried so much, because we live
near the optimal temperature for growing grains. But the thing is,
there's a lot of natural variability in growing-season temperature in
the mid-latitudes, compared to the tropics. Tropics are steady. So you
have this same wobbling around of temperatures, but I've warmed enough
so I'm now on the downside of that optimal slope, than it means you're
wobbling all over the slope, anything from perfectly warm conditions,
like we have today, to way too warm, as we have today in the tropics. So
the volatility in the yield will go through the roof. And our
calculations show that. By 2050, under a typical middle-of-the-road
emissions scenario, you're looking at a doubling of the volatility for
grains in the mid-latitudes. [[In]{.mark} places like China, the U.S.,
Europe, Ukraine --- [the **breadbasket countries**]{.mark} of the world
--- the [volatility]{.mark} from year to year just [from]{.mark} natural
[climate]{.mark} variability at a higher temperature [is going]{.mark}
to much [higher.]{.mark}]{.underline} The impact on the crops is going
to be greater and greater." And [you can't easily move
croplands]{.underline} north a few hundred miles, [because]{.underline}
yields in [places like remote Canada and Russia are limited by the
**quality of soil** there]{.underline}; [it takes]{.underline} many
[centuries]{.underline} for the planet [to produce optimally fertile
dirt]{.underline}."Pretty much all the arable land worth farming is
already being farmed, so I'm not sure you can say where to go," Battisti
told me. So warming couldn't help production at higher latitudes? I
asked. "No, no. You'd really have no change in higher latitudes, simply
because it takes a long time for soil to be prepared to grow grain. A
lot of places, you go north in Canada, you run out of soil. You run out
of conditions to grow. Part of it is climate, and part of it is grow
quality. There was a pretty big piece of ice up there not so long ago,
and there's not enough topsoil to grow grains." According to the U.N.'s
Food and Agriculture Organization, it takes about 1,000 years for three
centimeters of topsoil to form.

Drought might be an even bigger problem than heat, with some of the
world's most arable land turning quickly to desert."As much as one third
of the Earth's currently habited and arable land faces a near permanent
drying this century," Joseph Romm writes in Climate Change.
Precipitation is notoriously hard to model, yet predictions for later
this century are basically unanimous: unprecedented droughts nearly
everywhere food is today produced.Peter Brannen, in Ends of the World:
"By the year 2050, according to a 2014 MIT study, there [will also be
**5 billion people** living in water-stressed area]{.underline}s." By
2080, without dramatic reductions in emissions, southern Europe will be
in permanent extreme drought, much worse than the American dust bowl
ever was.See "Global warming and 21st century drying," a 2014 study led
by Benjamin I. Cook. The same will be true in Iraq and Syria and much of
the rest of the Middle East; some of the most densely populated parts of
Australia, Africa, and South America; and the breadbasket regions of
China.This is from Romm, page 99. None of these places, which today
supply much of the world's food, will be reliable sources of any. As for
the original dust bowl: The droughts in the American plains and
Southwest would not just be worse than in the 1930s, a 2015 NASA study
predicted, but worse than any droughts in a thousand years --- and that
includes those that struck between 1100 and 1300, which "dried up all
the rivers East of the Sierra Nevada mountains" and may have been
responsible for the death of the Anasazi civilization.The quote is Romm,
working off this study, summarized here.

Remember, we do not live in a world without hunger as it is. Far from
it: Most estimates put the number of undernourished at 800 million
globally.Technically, the World Hunger Organization puts the number at
795 million. In case you haven't heard, this spring has already brought
an unprecedented quadruple famine to Africa and the Middle East; the
U.N. has warned that [separate [starvation]{.mark} events]{.underline}
in Somalia, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Yemen **[[could kill 20
million]{.underline}]{.mark}** this year alone.Read about it from the
U.N. here.

IV\. Climate Plagues

What happens when the bubonic ice melts?

Rock, in the right spot, is a record of planetary history, eras as long
as millions of years flattened by the forces of geological time into
strata with amplitudes of just inches, or just an inch, or even less.
Ice works that way, too, as a climate ledger, but it is also frozen
history, some of which can be reanimated when unfrozen. [[There
are]{.underline}]{.mark} now, [[trapped in Arctic ice, diseases]{.mark}
that have not circulated]{.underline} in the air [for]{.underline}
[millions of years]{.underline} --- in some cases, since before humans
were around to encounter them.The BBC recently covered this well. Which
means [[our immune systems]{.mark} [would]{.mark} [have no idea how to
fight]{.mark}]{.underline} back when those prehistoric plagues emerge
from the ice.

The Arctic also stores terrifying bugs from more recent times. In
Alaska, already, [researchers]{.underline} have **[discovered remnants
of the 1918 flu]{.underline}** They actually extracted it from the
cadaver of a frozen woman. that infected as many as 500 million and
killed as many as 100 million --- about 5 percent of the world's
population and almost six times as many as had died in the world war for
which the pandemic served as a kind of gruesome capstone. As the BBC
reported in May, [scientists suspect smallpox and the bubonic plague are
**trapped in Siberian ice**]{.underline}, too --- an abridged history of
devastating human sickness, left out like egg salad in the Arctic sun.

Experts caution that many of these organisms won't actually survive the
thaw and point to the fastidious lab conditions under which they have
already reanimated several of them --- the 32,000-year-old
"extremophile" bacteria revived in 2005,This one came immediately back
to life. an 8 million-year-old bug brought back to life in 2007,This one
grew very slowly when revived. the 3.5 million--year--old one a Russian
scientist self-injected just out of curiosity"Just to see what would
happen," as Vice wrote in their profile of the scientist. Watch him on
YouTube, here. --- to suggest that those are necessary conditions for
the return of such ancient plagues.Jean-Michel Claverie and colleagues,
for instance, have published on this debate. But already last year, [a
boy was killed and 20 others infected by anthrax released when
retreating permafrost exposed the frozen carcass of a reindeer killed by
the bacteria at least 75 years earlier]{.underline}; 2,000 present-day
reindeer were infected, too, carrying and spreading the disease beyond
the tundra.The Guardian had a good news story about this episode;
anthrax had not previously been seen in the region since 1941.

What concerns epidemiologists more than ancient diseases are existing
scourges relocated, rewired, or even re-evolved by warming. The first
effect is geographical. Before the early-modern period, when adventuring
sailboats accelerated the mixing of peoples and their bugs, human
provinciality was a guard against pandemic. Today, even with
globalization and the enormous intermingling of human populations, our
ecosystems are mostly stable, and this functions as another limit, but
[global warming will scramble]{.underline} those [ecosystems and help
disease trespass]{.underline} those [limits]{.underline} as surely as
Cortés did. You don't worry much about dengue or malaria if you are
living in Maine or France. But as the tropics creep northward and
mosquitoes migrate with them, you will. You didn't much worry about Zika
a couple of years ago, either.

As it happens, Zika may also be a good model of the second worrying
effect --- disease mutation. One reason you hadn't heard about Zika
until recently is that it had been trapped in Uganda; another is that it
did not, until recently, appear to cause birth defects. Scientists still
don't entirely understand what happened, or what they missed.One of the
major problems here is that scientists lack much data about how Zika has
affected humans in the past. For some hypotheses about this mystery, see
this reporting by Time. But there are things we do know for sure about
how climate affects some diseases: [Malaria]{.underline}, for instance,
[thrives in hotter regions]{.underline} not just because the mosquitoes
that carry it do, too, but because for every degree increase in
temperature, the parasite reproduces ten times faster.The effect varies
based on latitude, humidity, and other factors, but this research is a
good place to start reading. Which is one reason that the World Bank
estimates that by 2050, 5.2 billion people will be reckoning with
it."The total population at risk in 2050 is projected to be about 5.2
billion if only climate impacts are considered," the World Bank says in
Turn Down the Heat. To be clear, "reckoning" does not mean that 5.2
billion people will be infected with malaria, but that that many people
will live in conditions where they could potentially be infected.

V. Unbreathable Air

A rolling death smog that suffocates millions.

Our lungs need oxygen, but that is only a fraction of what we breathe.
[The fraction of [carbon dioxide]{.mark} is growing]{.underline}: It
just crossed 400 parts per million, and high-end estimates extrapolating
from current trends suggest [**it [will hit 1,000 ppm]{.mark} by 2100**.
At that concentration]{.underline}, compared to the air we breathe now,
**[human [cognitive ability declines by 21
percent]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The science on this subject is young,
but here are two studies.

There is also a good summary of the research and its limitations in
Joseph Romm's Climate Change, pages 112--118.

Other stuff in the hotter air is even scarier, with small increases in
pollution capable of shortening life spans by ten years."An increase in
pollution particles in the air of 10 micrograms per cubic meter cuts
victims' life expectancy by 9-11 years," one recent study showed. The
warmer the planet gets, the more ozone forms, and by mid-century,
Americans will likely suffer a 70 percent increase in unhealthy ozone
smog, the National Center for Atmospheric Research has projected.That
study is from 2014, and can be found here. By 2090, as many as 2 billion
people globally will be breathing air above the WHO "safe" levelFrom
Joseph Romm, summarizing a report from the U.K.'s Met Office Hadley
Centre. ; one paper last month showed that, among other effects, a
pregnant mother's exposure to ozone raises the child's risk of autism
(as much as tenfold, combined with other environmental factors).This
study was published only last month; it considers a number of factors,
including exposure to ozone, that in combination increase a child's risk
of autism. Which does make you think again about the autism epidemic in
West Hollywood.The cause is as yet unclear, but Los Angeles's West
Hollywood neighborhood has had about three times as many autism
diagnoses as would be expected.

Already, more than 10,000 people die each day from the small particles
emitted from fossil-fuel burning"More than 10,000 people are dying each
day from the small particles coming out from fossil-fuel burning," James
Hansen told me, "which is more than have been killed in history from the
radiation from nuclear-power plants. It's an irrational fear of
low-level radiation. You have to avoid high levels of radiation, but we
know ways to do nuclear which are much safer --- that will not explode,
that won't produce a meltdown." ; each year, 339,000 people die from
wildfire smoke, in part because climate change has extended
forest-fireThis data is a decade old, and would likely be even higher
now. season (in the U.S., it's increased by 78 days since 1970See here.
). By 2050, according to the U.S. Forest Service, wildfires will be
twice as destructive as they are today; in some places, the area burned
could grow fivefold.For further reading, see this Forest Service
material about the longer fire season. What worries people even more is
the effect that would have on emissions, especially when the fires
ravage forests arising out of peat. Peatland fires in Indonesia in 1997,
for instance, added to the global CO2 release by up to 40 percent,The
fires continued into 1998, but the carbon quantification is limited to
the previous year; that suggests the estimate is likely too low. and
more burning only means more warming only means more burning. There is
also the terrifying possibility that rain forests like [the
Amazon]{.underline}, which in 2010 suffered its second "hundred-year
drought" in the space of five years,Obviously, droughts of this scale
should no longer, technically, be considered "hundred-year" events.
[could dry out enough to become vulnerable to]{.underline} these kinds
of devastating, **[rolling forest fires]{.underline}** --- [which
would]{.underline} not only [expel enormous]{.underline} amounts of
[carbon]{.underline} into the atmosphere [but also shrink
the]{.underline} size of the [forest]{.underline}. That is especially
bad because [the Amazon]{.underline} alone [provides 20 percent
of]{.underline} our **[oxygen]{.underline}**. Not that **[we're really
at risk of running out]{.underline}** of oxygen, even with a
significantly diminished Amazon.

Then there are the more familiar forms of pollution. In 2013, melting
Arctic ice remodeled Asian weather patterns, depriving industrial China
of the natural ventilation systems it had come to depend on, which
blanketed much of the country's north in an unbreathable smog."Today,
Shanghai air really has a layered taste," chef Alan Yu said in 2013. "At
first, it tastes slightly astringent with some smokiness. Upon full
contact with your palate, the aftertaste has some earthy bitterness, and
upon careful distinguishing you can even feel some dust-like particulate
matter." Literally unbreathable.This difficulty was widely reported, but
recently China has taken action to reduce its dependence on
coal-generated electricity, which will likely help the smog buildup. A
metric called the Air Quality Index categorizes the risks and tops out
at the 301-to-500 range, warning of "serious aggravation of heart or
lung disease and premature mortality in persons with cardiopulmonary
disease and the elderly" and, for all others, "serious risk of
respiratory effects"; at that level, "everyone should avoid all outdoor
exertion."For more information on the Air Quality Index and what it
measures, see here and here. The Chinese "airpocalypse" of 2013 peaked
at what would have been an Air Quality Index of over 800.Some of these
measures vary a bit. That year, smog was responsible for a third of all
deaths in the country.In many cases, the smog exacerbated other medical
conditions.

VI\. Perpetual War

The violence baked into heat.

Climatologists are very careful when talking about Syria."There's a lot
of qualitative narrative evidence linking climate to the Syrian civil
conflict," Marshall Burke of Stanford's Earth System Science Center told
me. "I think some of that's compelling. But it's hard to make a
quantitative case for any particular conflict that climate was the
cause, right? We don't observe the Syrian civil war in the absence of
the drought that happened in 2007, so we don't have a good experiment."
Michael Mann, director of Pennsylvania State University's Earth System
Science Center, told me this: "The Syrian uprising was driven by another
drought that was the worst drought on record --- the paleo record
suggests the worst in 900 years.

[Drought]{.underline} is a big one, [it's behind a lot of the
conflict]{.underline} that we see." They want you to know that while
climate change did produce a drought that contributed to civil war, it
is not exactly fair to say that the conflict is the result of warming;
next door, for instance, Lebanon suffered the same crop failures. Of
course there are many negative shocks short of civil war.

"In 2012," Peter Brannen writes in Ends of the World, "when the monsoon
failed in India (as it's expected to do in a warmer world), 670 million
people --- that is, 10 percent of the global population --- lost access
to power when the grid was crippled by unusually high demand from
farmers struggling to irrigate their fields, while the high temperatures
sent many Indians seeking kilowatt-chugging air conditioning." But
researchers like Marshall Burke and Solomon Hsiang have managed to
quantify some of the non-obvious relationships between temperature and
violence"A lot of folks have looked at these relationships, and they've
been sort of hypothesized for a long time," Burke told me. "You can find
it as far back as Shakespeare and probably even earlier than that ---
mentions of linkages between climate and human violence. So there's this
nice part in Romeo and Juliet where the good guys are out in the streets
--- it's like Benvolio and Mercutio or something --- and they're talking
and one of them says to the other, 'We should go inside. It's hot out.
We're gonna get pissed off and things are gonna go badly.' And then all
hell breaks loose.

That's how I start every talk on conflict now. 'This is the Shakespeare
reference.'" He continued: "It's sort of remarkable how clear and
replicable the results have been, when you look over the last 20 or 30
years, periods over which we have sort of better conflict data around
the world and can do a good job of sort of understanding statistically
what the linkages have been. We can look at different types of conflict,
and, depending on where you are, there are certain types of conflict and
there aren't certain types of conflict. The iconic civil-war picture
people have in their mind, those unfortunately still occur and tend to
occur mostly in places like sub-Saharan Africa. So that's where a lot of
the research there is focused. Of course in the U.S., we don't have
civil wars, or at least not for the last 150 years. But we have other
types of human violence, and those are pretty well measured in data and
we can study those. And [across all these different types of violence,
again, we see this strong positive relationship between
warmer-than-average temperatures and **increasing
conflict**."]{.underline} : For [every half-degree of
warming]{.underline}, they say, [[societies will see between a]{.mark}
**10 and [20 percent increase]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the likelihood of
[armed]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark}."]{.underline}When you increase
temperature by half a degree, on average you see something like a 10 to
20 percent increase in the risk of conflict," Burke told me. "Now, that,
of course, does not mean that every conflict has something to do with
the climate system. We're not claiming that every conflict has a climate
root. But on average [climate]{.underline} has [worked]{.underline}, as
the CIA says, **[as a threat multiplier]{.underline}** for conflict
around the world. This just shows up so strongly in the data that we
just can't ignore it, right? We can't turn away from this historical
fact in the data. Do we fully understand that fact? I don't think so.
There are a lot of different potential mechanisms that could link
climate to conflict. But it is in the data. So now I think it's our job
as researchers to better understand what are the exact mechanisms that
link these two things.

And there are a lot of folks working on that. Our team's working on it.
Other folks are. And we have some ideas. But I wouldn't say there's a
smoking gun in terms of perfectly understanding the linkage. But to
ignore the linkage in the data, to me, would be insane. It's so strongly
there, and comes through in so many settings, that it's just a
statistical fact." In climate science, nothing is simple, but the
arithmetic is harrowing: A planet five degrees warmer would have at
least half again as many wars as we do today. Overall, [social conflict
could **more than double** this century]{.underline}.To read more of
Burke and Hsiang's work on the relationship between climate and
conflict, I recommend these two papers.

This is one reason that, as nearly every climate scientist I spoke to
pointed out, the U.S. military is obsessed with climate changeIn 2015,
the Department of Defense released this major report on the impacts of
climate change on national security. : [The drowning of all American
Navy bases by sea-level rise is trouble enough]{.underline}, but being
the world's policeman is quite a bit harder when the crime rate doubles.
Of course, it's not just Syria where climate has contributed to
conflict. Some speculate that the elevated level of strife across the
Middle East over the past generation reflects the pressures of global
warming"The Middle East, where we've also seen a lot of this conflict
--- I don't think we can rule out potential effects there, either now or
in the future," Burke told me. --- a hypothesis all the more cruel
considering that warming began accelerating when the industrialized
world extracted and then burned the region's oil.

What accounts for the relationship between climate and conflict? Some of
it comes down to agriculture and economics "[Hot temperatures reduce
agricultural productivity]{.underline}, lower crop yields, and, at the
margin for [farmers]{.underline} who are close to subsistence, this
could alter their incentives to **[start or join a
conflict]{.underline}**," Burke told me. "They need resources. They need
to put food on the table. And joining a conflict is one way to do that,
as I think a long literature has shown. And, again, it's not like hot
temperature is needed to turn everyone into a civil-war insurgent.

These civil wars are often started with very small numbers of people. So
you only need to affect the decisions of literally handfuls of
individuals to get some of these conflicts." ; a lot has to do with
forced migration, already at a record high, with at least 65 million
displaced people wandering the planet right now.See here. But there is
also the simple fact of individual irritability. "People are more pissed
off on Twitter when it's hot," Burke told me. "They use frowny face
emoticons more often. [People commit aggravated assault and homicide
**more often** when it's hot in the U.S]{.underline}. This has been show
pretty clearly. We have new work showing that people commit violence on
themselves more often when it's hot. So you see rates of suicide go up
when temperatures are hot. All sorts of human violence --- from an
individual scale all the way up to a group-level scale --- show an
increase when you crank up the temperature. The agricultural stuff I
think is a plausible explanation for group-scale violence. It is a less
plausible explanation for the individual-level stuff." Heat increases
municipal crime rates, and swearing on social media, and the likelihood
that a major-league pitcher, coming to the mound after his teammate has
been hit by a pitch, will hit an opposing batter in retaliation.The
study on baseball retaliation can be found here, and further interesting
research between heat and crime here. And the arrival of
air-conditioning in the developed world, in the middle of the past
century, did little to solve the problem of the summer crime wave.

VII\. Permanent Economic Collapse

Dismal capitalism in a half-poorer world.

The murmuring mantra of global neoliberalism, which prevailed between
the end of the Cold War and the onset of the Great Recession, is that
economic growth would save us from anything and everything.

But in the aftermath of the 2008 crash, a growing number of historians
studying what they call "fossil capitalism"Andreas Malm's Fossil Capital
is the touchstone. have begun to suggest that the entire history of
swift economic growth, which began somewhat suddenly in the 18th
century, is not the result of innovation or trade or the dynamics of
global capitalism but simply our discovery of fossil fuels and all their
raw power --- a onetime injection of new "value" into a system that had
previously been characterized by global subsistence living. Before
fossil fuels, nobody lived better than their parents or grandparents or
ancestors from 500 years before, except in the immediate aftermath of a
great plague like the Black Death, which allowed the lucky survivors to
gobble up the resources liberated by mass graves. After we've burned all
the fossil fuels, these scholars suggest, perhaps we will return to a
"steady state" global economy. Of course, that onetime injection has a
devastating long-term cost: climate change.

The most exciting research on the economics of warming has also come
from Hsiang and his colleagues, who are not historians of fossil
capitalism but who offer some very bleak analysis of their ownThey've
also put together a helpful website exploring and illustrating their
findings. : [[Every degree]{.mark} Celsius of warming
[costs]{.mark}]{.underline}, on average**[, [1.2 percent of
GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}**"You see huge responses in GDP to fluctuations
in temperature," Burke told me. "So in hot countries if you crank up the
temperature one degree Celsius you lose about one percentage point GDP
growth in that year. Instead of growing at 2 percent a year you're
growing at 1 percent a year. So there's a huge effect." The precise 1.2
percentage point estimate for GDP loss is for the United States. (an
enormous number, considering we count growth in the low single digits as
"strong""It turns out, historically the optimum temperature for
producing things is about 13 degrees Celsius," Burke told me. "That's
what we see in the historical data. And a couple of the largest
economies in the world, coincidentally or not, are right at 13 degrees
Celsius. So the annual average temperature in the U.S. is right above.
It's 13-point-something, 13.4 degrees Celsius, which is sort of funny to
think about. I live out here in the Bay Area and the annual average
temperature in Palo Alto, California, is 13 degrees Celsius. Silicon
Valley is at the optimum temperature for producing things as measured
historically." ). This is the sterling work in the field, and their
median projection is for a 23 percent loss in per capita earning
globally by the end of this century (resulting from changes in
agriculture, crime, storms, energy, mortality, and labor).That paper is
found here.

Tracing the shape of the probability curve is even scarier: [There is a
12 percent chance that climate change will reduce global output by
**more than 50 percent** by 2100]{.underline}, they say, [and [a 51
percent chance]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[it]{.mark} [lowers per
capita GDP by 20 percent]{.mark}]{.underline}** or more by then, unless
emissions decline. By comparison, [the Great Recession lowered global
GDP by about 6 percent]{.underline}, in a onetime shock; Hsiang and his
colleagues estimate a one-in-eight chance of an ongoing and irreversible
effect by the end of the century that is eight times worse.You can
explore this material more here.

The scale of that economic devastation is hard to comprehend, but you
can start by imagining what the world would look like today with an
economy half as big, which would produce only half as much value,
generating only half as much to offer the workers of the world. It makes
the grounding of flights out of heat-stricken Phoenix last monthThe
science of this is fascinating. A crude summary: Hotter air is less
dense, which means less lift for planes trying to take off. (Also
interestingly, some models are more effective at higher temperatures
than others.) seem like pathetically small economic potatoes. And, among
other things, it makes the idea of postponing government action on
reducing emissions and relying solely on growth and technology to solve
the problem an absurd business calculation.

Every round-trip ticket on flights from New York to London, keep in
mind, costs the Arctic three more square meters of ice.Which does
suggest the wisdom of a carbon tax.

VIII\. Poisoned Oceans

Sulfide burps off the skeleton coast.

That [the sea will become a killer]{.underline} is a given."People are
expecting, depending on what we do, maybe two or three feet in the next
hundred years," Richard Alley told me. "But there's some chance of 15.
If you put that in, that's one that's clearly concerning. The worst case
you can think of is, you build the levees, you tell people it's safe,
[West Antarctic collapses, and the **levees fail**]{.underline}. There's
a bit of worry about the predictability. If it goes fast --- and fast
would be decades or less, rather than centuries or more --- it will
probably involve a lot of breakage, a lot of icebergs breaking off.
Fracture mechanics is pretty well understood, but the predictability of
it ... Just think of all the times in your life that you've seen
somebody drop a ceramic coffee cup on the floor. Do we understand
fracture? Sure. Can you accurately predict what one coffee cup will do
when you drop it on the floor? Maybe not." Barring a radical reduction
of emissions, we will see at least four feet of sea-level rise and
possibly ten by the end of the century.Ten feet is the upper estimate. A
third of the world's major cities are on the coast,See this paper from
Gordon McGranahan, Deborah Balk, and Bridget Anderson. When looking just
at extremely large cities --- those with populations above 5 million ---
nearly two-thirds are on the coast. not to mention its power plants,
ports, navy bases, farmlands, fisheries, river deltas, marshlands, and
rice-paddy empires, and even those above ten feet will flood much more
easily, and much more regularly, if the water gets that high."As the sea
level rises, it's like a diving board for storm surge," Peter Ward told
me. "You're causing storm surge to jump ever farther inland." At least
600 million people live within ten meters of sea level today.See, again,
the paper from McGranahan, Balk, and Anderson.

But the drowning of those homelands is just the start. At present, more
than a third of the world's carbon is sucked up by the oceansEstimates
vary from about a quarter to about half; this paper suggests 40 percent
of all carbon since the beginning of the industrial era has gone into
the ocean. Lee Kump's estimate is higher: "Half of the fossil fuels
we've burned have gone into the ocean, which has mitigated the warming,"
he told me. Then added: "What are the limits to the Earth's ability to
do that? --- thank God, or else we'd have that much more warming
already. But the result is what's called "ocean acidification," which,
on its own, may add a half a degree to warming this century.See here. It
is also already burning through the planet's water basins --- you may
remember these as the place where life arose in the first place. You
have probably heard of "coral bleaching" --- that is, coral dyingIn
fairness, coral bleaching is not quite a true euphemism for coral dying;
when corals are stressed, they expel algae, which turns them white. The
corals can recover but often do not. --- which is very bad news, because
reefs support as much as a quarter of all marine life and supply food
for half a billion people.Although some scientists believe there is hope
for the reefs. Ocean [acidification will **fry fish
populations**]{.underline} directly, too, though scientists aren't yet
sure how to predict the effects on the stuff we haul out of the ocean to
eatIf you think about the plankton floating around the ocean, they're at
the base of the food chain," Lee Kump told me. "There's a cascade of
effects up the food chain that can have impacts on food supply for
humans especially --- that's associated with coastal fisheries, that
sort of thing." ; they do know that in acid waters, oysters and mussels
will struggle to grow their shells,See here. and that when the pH of
human blood drops as much as the oceans' pH has over the past
generation, it induces seizures, comas, and sudden death.This is
obviously a very loose analogy, but it's based on material from the
Smithsonian.

It's also not an uncommon one; Lee Kump, too, resorted to the analogy of
the human body when explaining to me the principle of ocean homeostasis,
and what its disruption might mean. "An underlying theoretical framework
for that arises from human homeostatic mechanisms," he said. "We have
homeostatic mechanisms for stabilizing body temperature and all
different parts of our physiology."

That isn't all that ocean acidification can do. [Carbon absorption can
initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different
kinds of microbes that turn the water still more "anoxic]{.underline},"
first in deep ocean "dead zones," then gradually up toward the
surface."The other thing we should be watching very closely," Lee Kump
told me, "is the expansion of low-oxygen waters --- the so-called dead
zones in the coastal ocean, where the drop of oxygen is the combined
effect of the warming, because the water can just take up less oxygen."
There, the small fish die out, unable to breathe, which means
oxygen-eating bacteria thrive, and the feedback loop doubles
back.Research on climate change and dead zones can be found here, and is
synthesized here.

That paper notes: "Given the variety and strength of the mechanisms by
which climate change exacerbates hypoxia" --- that's lack of oxygen ---
"and the rates at which climate is changing, we posit that climate
change variables are contributing to the dead zone epidemic." This
process, in which [dead zones grow like cancers]{.underline}, choking
off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in
parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where [hydrogen
sulfide]{.underline} [is bubbling]{.underline} out of the sea along a
thousand-mile stretch of land known as the "Skeleton Coast."Read NASA on
hydrogen sulfide and the Skeleton Coast. The name originally referred to
the detritus of the whaling industry, but today it's more apt than ever.
Hydrogen sulfide is so toxic that evolution has trained us to recognize
the tiniest, safest traces of it, which is why our noses are so
exquisitely skilled at registering flatulence. [Hydrogen sulfide is also
the thing that finally did us in that time **97 percent of all life on
Earth died**]{.underline}, once all the feedback loops had been
triggered and the circulating jet streams of a warmed ocean ground to a
haltSee this summary of findings by Lee Kump. --- it's the planet's
preferred gas for a natural holocaust. Gradually, the ocean's dead zones
spread, killing off marine species that had dominated the oceans for
hundreds of millions of years, and [the gas the inert waters gave off
into the atmosphere **poisoned everything on land**.]{.underline}
Plants, too. It was millions of years before the oceans recovered.

IX\. The Great Filter

Our present eeriness cannot last.

So why can't we see it? In his recent book-length essay The Great
Derangement, the Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh wonders why global warming
and natural disaster haven't become major subjects of contemporary
fiction --- why we don't seem able to imagine climate catastrophe, and
why we haven't yet had a spate of novels in the genre he basically
imagines into half-existence and names "the environmental uncanny."
"Consider, for example, the stories that congeal around questions like,
'Where were you when the Berlin Wall fell?' or 'Where were you on
9/11?' " he writes. "Will it ever be possible to ask, in the same vein,
'Where were you at 400 ppm?' or 'Where were you when the Larsen B ice
shelf broke up?' " His answer: Probably not, because the dilemmas and
dramas of climate change are simply incompatible with the kinds of
stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, especially in novels, which
tend to emphasize the journey of an individual conscience rather than
the poisonous miasma of social fate.In general, I'd say Ghosh is more or
less accurate in describing the state of the "climate novel," though
there has been a recent rise in disaster fiction. But he is less on
point when talking more generally about our narrative culture; our
movies and television, for instance, have been littered lately with
apocalypse scenarios, not all climate-related but which can probably be
understood as in some ways inflected by climate anxiety.

Perhaps a more interesting question is not why we have failed to imagine
these scenarios, but why we have quarantined them, culturally, as
something like parables, rather than stories that impress on us the
real-world urgency of climate change.

Surely this blindness will not last --- the world we are about to
inhabit will not permit it. In a six-degree-warmer world, the Earth's
ecosystem will boil with so many natural disasters that we will just
start calling them "weather": a constant swarm of out-of-control
typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts, the planet assaulted
regularly with climate events that not so long ago destroyed whole
civilizations. The strongest hurricanes will come more often, and we'll
have to invent new categories with which to describe them; tornadoes
will grow longer and wider"In particular, the trail of destruction from
tornadoes may be getting longer and wider," Joseph Romm writes in
Climate Change, summarizing the work of James Elsner. and strike much
more frequently,The reaction of tornadoes to climate change is not fully
understood, but Michael Tippett of Columbia explains that a warming
climate will make the circumstances necessary for tornado formation much
more common.

In Climate Change, Romm quotes Tom Karl, director of NOAA's National
Climatic Data Center saying "What we can say with confidence is that
heavy and extreme precipitation events often associated with
thunderstorms and convection are increasing and have been linked to
human-induced changes in atmospheric composition." and hail rocks will
quadruple in size.Tippett has published dozens of papers on this
subject. Also, see this paper by John T. Allen in Nature on the
potential of hail increasing in size and frequency due to climate
change. Humans used to watch the weather to prophesy the future; going
forward, we will see in its wrath the vengeance of the past. Early
naturalists talked often about "deep time" --- the perception they had,
contemplating the grandeur of this valley or that rock basin, of the
profound slowness of nature. What lies in store for us is more like what
the Victorian anthropologists identified as "dreamtime," or "everywhen":
the semi-mythical experience, described by Aboriginal Australians, of
encountering, in the present moment, an out-of-time past, when
ancestors, heroes, and demigods crowded an epic stage. You can find it
already watching footage of an iceberg collapsing into the sea --- a
feeling of history happening all at once.

It is. Many people perceive climate change as a sort of moral and
economic debt, accumulated since the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution and now come due after several centuries --- a helpful
perspective, in a way, since it is the carbon-burning processes that
began in 18th-century England that lit the fuse of everything that
followed. But more than half of the carbon humanity has exhaled into the
atmosphere in its entire history has been emitted in just the past three
decades; since the end of World War II, the figure is 85 percent.The
graph of emissions over time is very vivid. Which means that, in the
length of a single generation, global warming has brought us to the
brink of planetary catastrophe, and that the story of the industrial
world's kamikaze mission is also the story of a single lifetime. My
father's, for instance: born in 1938, among his first memories the news
of Pearl Harbor and the mythic Air Force of the propaganda films that
followed, films that doubled as advertisements for imperial-American
industrial might; and among his last memories the coverage of the
desperate signing of the Paris climate accords on cable news, ten weeks
before he died of lung cancer last July. Or my mother's: born in 1945,
to German Jews fleeing the smokestacks through which their relatives
were incinerated, now enjoying her 72nd year in an American commodity
paradise, a paradise supported by the supply chains of an industrialized
developing world. She has been smoking for 57 of those years,
unfiltered.

Or the scientists'. Some of the men who first identified a changing
climate (and given the generation, those who became famous were men) are
still alive; a few are even still working. Wally Broecker is 84 years
old and drives to work at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory across
the Hudson every day from the Upper West Side. Like most of those who
first raised the alarm, he believes that no amount of emissions
reduction alone can meaningfully help avoid disaster. Instead, he puts
his faith in carbon capture --- untested technology to extract carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere, which Broecker estimates will cost at least
several trillion dollars --- and various forms of "geoengineering," the
catchall name for a variety of moon-shot technologies far-fetched enough
that many climate scientists prefer to regard them as dreams, or
nightmares, from science fiction.My full interview with Broecker is
here.

Among the scientists I interviewed for this story, David Battisti was
among the most outspoken about the risks of geoengineering of this kind.
"It's really stupid as an insurance policy --- to think it's anything
but a Hail Mary pass," he said. "This is so obvious to us. I've worked
on it in the past --- you don't have to do very much to show that it's
dangerous. I'd rather see the world go to four degrees warmer than do
geoengineering." He is especially focused on what's called the aerosol
approachScientists at Harvard have recently launched a new research
effort into aerosol injection. --- dispersing so much sulfur dioxide
into the atmosphere that when it converts to sulfuric acid, it will
cloud a fifth of the horizon and reflect back 2 percent of the sun's
rays, buying the planet at least a little wiggle room, heat-wise. "Of
course, that would make our sunsets very red, would bleach the sky,
would make more acid rain," he says. "But you have to look at the
magnitude of the problem. You got to watch that you don't say the giant
problem shouldn't be solved because the solution causes some smaller
problems." He won't be around to see that, he told me. "But in your
lifetime ..."

Jim Hansen is another member of this godfather generation. Born in 1941,
he became a climatologist at the University of Iowa, developed the
groundbreaking "Zero Model" for projecting climate change, and later
became the head of climate research at NASA, only to leave under
pressure when, while still a federal employee, he filed a lawsuit
against the federal government charging inaction on warming (along the
way he got arrested a few times for protesting, too).Including for
protesting the Keystone XL pipeline. The lawsuit, which is brought by a
collective called Our Children's Trust and is often described as "kids
versus climate change," is built on an appeal to the equal-protection
clause, namely, that in failing to take action on warming, the
government is violating it by imposing massive costs on future
generations; it is scheduled to be heard this winter in Oregon district
court.Go here for more information on the case; it could be hugely
significant. Hansen has recently given up on solving the climate problem
with a carbon tax alone,The word "alone" has been added to to make clear
that James Hansen still supports a carbon-tax-based approach to
emissions, even though he no longer believes it will be sufficient.
which had been his preferred approach, and has set about calculating the
total cost of the additional measure of extracting carbon from the
atmosphere.

[Hansen began his career studying Venus, which was once a very
Earth-like planet with plenty of life-supporting water before runaway
climate change rapidly transformed it into an arid and uninhabitable
sphere enveloped in an unbreathable gas;]{.underline} he switched to
studying our planet by 30, wondering why he should be squinting across
the solar system to explore rapid environmental change when he could see
it all around him on the planet he was standing on. "When we wrote our
first paper on this, in 1981," he told me, "I remember saying to one of
my co-authors, 'This is going to be very interesting. Sometime during
our careers, we're going to see these things beginning to happen.' "

Several of the scientists I spoke with proposed global warming as the
solution to Fermi's famous paradox, which asks, If the universe is so
big, then why haven't we encountered any other intelligent life in it?
The answer, they suggested, is that the natural life span of a
civilization may be only several thousand years, and the life span of an
industrial civilization perhaps only several hundred. In a universe that
is many billions of years old, with star systems separated as much by
time as by space, civilizations might emerge and develop and burn
themselves up simply too fast to ever find one another.In their paper
"Anthropic Shadow," Nick Bostrom and his colleagues explored our
difficulty understanding truly existential risks. Because, by
definition, human life has evolved to where it is today in the absence
of a species-extinguishing event, we present-day human historians are
endowed with enormous, accidental overconfidence in our capacity to
endure, they suggest. This is another corollary of the anthropic
principle: We take the human experience as our only model of evolution,
discounting entirely the infinite number of evolutionary branches cut
dead at the nub elsewhere in the universe. "As a consequence," Bostrom
and his colleagues write, "we should have no confidence in historically
based probability estimates for events that would certainly extinguish
humanity." Peter Ward, a charismatic paleontologist among those
responsible for discovering that the planet's mass extinctions were
caused by greenhouse gas, calls this the "Great Filter": "[Civilizations
rise, but there's an environmental filter that causes them to **die
off** again and **disappear** fairly quickly]{.underline}," he told me.
"If you look at planet Earth, the filtering we've had in the past has
been in these mass extinctions."My full interview with Ward ends with
his saying, "Go get 'em, man. We need people out there like you. I mean
it. Though you're not going to get thanked for it, you know." The mass
extinction we are now living through has only just begun; so much more
dying is coming.

And yet, improbably, Ward is an optimist. So are Broecker and Hansen and
many of the other scientists I spoke to. We have not developed much of a
religion of meaning around climate change that might comfort us, or give
us purpose, in the face of possible annihilation. But climate scientists
have a strange kind of faith: We will find a way to forestall radical
warming, they say, because we must.

It is not easy to know how much to be reassured by that bleak certainty,
and how much to wonder whether it is another form of delusion; for
global warming to work as parable, of course, someone needs to survive
to tell the story. The scientists know that to even meet the Paris
goals, by 2050, carbon emissions from energy and industry, which are
still rising, will have to fall by half each decade; emissions from land
use (deforestation, cow farts, etc.) will have to zero out; and we will
need to have invented technologies to extract, annually, twice as much
carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet's plants now do.This
road map was laid out in Science and neatly summarized in Vox.
Nevertheless, by and large, the [scientists have an enormous confidence
in the ingenuity of humans]{.underline} --- a confidence perhaps
bolstered by their appreciation for climate change, which is, after all,
a human invention, too. They point to the Apollo project, the hole in
the ozone we patched in the 1980s,The Montreal Protocol, which was
finalized in 1987, regulated the use of ozone-depleting substances such
as CFCs. Its effects in shrinking the ozone hole began to be measurable
in 2000. the passing of the fear of mutually assured destruction. Now
[[we've found]{.mark} a way to engineer our own
**[doomsday]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and surely [[we will]{.mark} find a
way to **[engineer our way out of it]{.mark}**,]{.underline} one way or
another. The planet is not used to being provoked like this, and climate
systems designed to give feedback over centuries or millennia prevent us
--- even those who may be watching closely --- from fully imagining the
damage done already to the planet. But when we do truly see the world
we've made, they say, we will also find a way to make it livable. For
them, the alternative is simply unimaginable.

### 2ac -- impact -- nato 

#### NATO is [key]{.underline}\-\--it's a [full-spectrum]{.underline} force multiplier and [guarantees]{.underline} multilateral logistics 

**Weinrod 16** - Former Secretary of Defense Representative Europe and
Defense Advisor to the U.S. Mission NATO (W Bruce, "We Still Need NATO,"
The American Interest,
https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/01/15/we-still-need-nato/)

[Not only does [NATO]{.mark} remain relevant, but more importantly it
[continues to support]{.mark} and advance [U.S. security]{.mark}
interests]{.underline}---though again, often in ways that do not make
headlines and that casual observers rarely appreciate in full. Most
fundamentally, [[NATO provides]{.mark} a standing [multilateral military
capability]{.mark} [that can]{.mark} **[deter or be deployed]{.mark}**
should a significant security threat arise]{.underline}. Because NATO
has a military capability in place, the core elements for mobilization,
deployment, and sustainment of substantial multilateral military forces
already exist. The [[ongoing training]{.mark}, exercises, [and]{.mark}
regular [communication]{.mark} among the national militaries of NATO
members [allows]{.mark} them to **[jump-start]{.mark}** preparations and
[actions]{.mark} when needed **[without]{.mark}** very [lengthy
prep]{.mark}aratory work]{.underline}. [[This can]{.mark} [allow the
U.S.]{.mark} government [to]{.mark} proceed in [shap]{.mark}ing [and
lead]{.mark}ing [military coalitions]{.mark} more [quickly, at less
cost]{.mark} and [with greater effectiveness]{.mark}, than if NATO did
not exist and its functional equivalent had to be invented from scratch
at a moment's not]{.underline}ice. While the U.S. government retains the
capacity and the right to act unilaterally if and when necessary, it
makes sense for it to act with others whenever possible, whether through
NATO or ad hoc coalitions of the willing. [A multilateral framework can
provide both political cover and military resources, and the United
States very much can benefit from both]{.underline}. [The United States
also benefits significantly from NATO's **logistics**
capabilities]{.underline}. Pontificating about grand strategies sounds
impressive, but for military effectiveness and success, [logistics
capabilities are what really count]{.underline}. [For example, while
NATO did not formally participate in the 1991 Gulf War, [NATO resources,
supplies, bases, and]{.mark} other [infrastructure]{.mark}
[provided]{.mark} crucial [support]{.mark} prior to and [during]{.mark}
the U.S.-led coalition military action to force Saddam Hussein out of
[Kuwait]{.mark}.]{.underline} The coalition in effect borrowed NATO
capacities already in existence, and benefitted greatly from equipment
compatibility and common training and resources. [[Other coalitions
of]{.mark} the willing assembled under U.S auspices and utilizing NATO
resources can follow the same approach]{.underline}. In addition, [[the
U.S.]{.mark} government [has access to]{.mark} the [numerous]{.mark}
military [facilities and resources that member nations make available to
NATO]{.mark}. A good example is Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, now being
used against ISIS in what is not a formal NATO operation]{.underline}.
As importantly, [[working through NATO]{.mark} usually [makes it]{.mark}
relatively [**routine** for host governments to **agree** to]{.mark}
[U.S. requests]{.mark} to use facilities within their territory for
military-related purposes]{.underline}. [Without NATO,]{.underline} in
order to fulfill its security responsibilities, the U.S. government
would need to develop and maintain a complex network of bilateral and
multilateral security agreements and arrangements that would seek to
maintain the kind of connectivity and flexibility that NATO already
provides. Further, [the U.S. government would need not only agreements
to access such military facilities but also would likely need to obtain
specific approval from the host nation for each use and perhaps even in
some cases legislative approval]{.underline}. In general, [[it
is]{.mark} much simpler, [faster]{.mark}, [and **easier
politically**]{.mark} and otherwise for nations [to grant the]{.mark}
United [States]{.mark} the use of their [facilities within]{.mark} a
[NATO]{.mark} framework than it would be to have to grant permission to
the United States on their own]{.underline}. Over recent decades
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} has, as noted above,
[[developed]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[global
security]{.underline}]{.mark} network that reflects formalized
relationships with non-NATO nations. For the United States, this brings
the advantage that it can work through NATO to develop or enhance
security relationships with states that belong to the PFP, the MD, the
ICI, and NATO bilateral security relationships. [Working through NATO
provides an extra dimension to U.S. efforts to enhance the military
capacities of friends and allies in various regions who, with training
and assistance, can provide supplementary support to NATO or U.S.-led
operations. [NATO also supports]{.mark} U.S. interests by providing a
multilateral framework for a U.S. [presence]{.mark} in nations
[where]{.mark} [the U.S.]{.mark} government [wishes to]{.mark} help
[train]{.mark} and also enhance its military [contacts]{.mark}, but
where unilateral U.S. military involvement might be politically
contentious]{.underline}.

### Impact - Genocide

**[Nationalists want a strong central state, free of foreign
interference]{.underline}**: "[The state is greater than class or
party](http://www.istpravda.com.ua/articles/2013/06/28/127808/)." They
are proud to uphold the [permanent
revolution](http://defendinghistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Grzegorz-Rossolinski-Liebe-on-The-Ukrainian-National-Revolution-of-1941.pdf)
dogma of Dmytro Dontsov and Mykola Stsyborsky, 1920s fascists now
lionized as fathers of the [national
idea](https://www.pravda.com.ua/columns/2010/02/6/4714492/).
Stsyborsky's book
[Naziocracy](http://www.naso.org.ua/main/830-nacokratya-mikoli-scborskogo.html)defines
a meritocratic racism in which only the most patriotic, activist
citizens of the ethnic majority may vote -- a theme echoed by today's
social-nationalism. Adherents of this ideology, like [anti-Bolshevik
national hero and SS trainer Stepan
Bandera](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,892820,00.html),
collaborated with the Nazis. It's easy for enemies like Russia to point
to this ethno-fascist rhetoric to undermine the validity of the
Ukrainian national project. Nationalist militias volunteer to suppress
pro-Russian separatists because the government does not. This leads to a
perception that they are Robin Hoods out to right injustice.
**[Far-right activists]{.underline}** who join the state gain a veneer
of patriotism that obscures their previous illiberal affinities. They
**[have thus infiltrated their extremism into Ukraine's power
structures, civil society, and elected government]{.underline}** by
wrapping it in the flag, coopting protests, and committing themselves to
a long march through the state's institutions. Former U.S. ambassador
Geoffrey Pyatt said in 2014, "[Svoboda has proven its democratic bona
fides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/ukraine-uprising-fascist-coup-grassroots-movement)."
But only 15 years earlier in the first issue of [their newsletter
Orientyry](https://archivar-ua.livejournal.com/photo/album/2395/), chief
editor Parubiy wrote, "the Ukrainian nation rejects ideological traps of
communism and democratic liberalism and will return to life-giving
principles that inspired the great Aryan civilization." This
[social-nationalist](https://mykharkov.info/news/belyj-vozhd-chem-zarekomendoval-sebya-v-harkove-komandir-azova-andrej-biletskij-93484.html)
message is potent to impoverished youth in remote regions. It inspires
pride that they are not Asian like Russians, but actually the ancient
Caucasian root race mythologized by racists -- proud Slavic Aryan
[descendants of elder tribes](https://ukrainianweek.com/History/88577)
like the Trypillians, Amazons, Scythians, Sarmatians, Goths, Vikings,
and Cossacks. **[Were Ukraine not a place [where the Holocaust
happened](https://www.jpost.com/Magazine/One-Ukraine-two-Jews-577695),
such views might be tabloid curiosities. But paired with theories of the
country's occupation by pro-Russian oligarchs who are often not
ethnically Ukrainian, these narratives are redolent of
Judeo-Bolshevism]{.underline}**. To be sure, [anti-Semitism is at
relatively lower
levels](https://ukrainianjewishencounter.org/en/who-benefits-from-myths-about-the-second-world-war/)
today. Moreover, [250,000 Jews remain in
Ukraine](https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/282575/jews-center-stage-in-ukraine-elections)and
the prime minister, leading oligarchs, and potential next president are
all Jewish. Still, **[right-wing hostility toward Jews has deep roots --
Ukraine is]{.underline}**, after all, **[a land that's seen
[pogroms](https://ukrainianjewishencounter.org/en/between-the-whites-and-the-reds-who-carried-out-pogroms-against-the-jews-during-the-civil-war/)
and the Holocaust]{.underline}**. As a result, **[the majority of the
country's Jews left in multiple waves from the late 1800s through the
1990s. Progress has been made, but it's important not to let that
progress obscure the long history of deep hostility towards its Jewish
minority -- a history that's impossible to separate from today's
anti-Russian, nationalist movement, and one that will become even more
important if Zelenskiy prevails. The nationalists']{.underline}**
sub-state and extra-parliamentary **[power is shocking]{.underline}**.
Ukrainian sociologist Dr. Volodymyr Ishchenko's **[statistical analysis
of 60,000 protest events]{.underline}** during the period of Yanukovych
and Maidan strongly indicates that **[the [far right was the most
prevalent collective
agent](https://cslr.org.ua/en/the-far-right-are-still-the-most-visible-political-forces/)]{.underline}**,
just as they claim. Many say they are just waiting for the signal to
finish the revolution. Some note that according to special operation
forces doctrine, **[it only takes five percent of a population to
[overthrow the
government](https://fpc.org.uk/the-unique-extra-parliamentary-power-of-ukrainian-radical-nationalists-is-a-threat-to-the-political-regime-and-minorities/),
which they point out they have already done once]{.underline}**.
Veterans official Vyacheslav Marchenko told me last year that **[tens of
thousands of nationalists train at camps around the country, working to
counter Ukraine's supposed occupation with weapons looted from
government arsenals]{.underline}** during the last revolution, as well
as trophy guns removed from the war zone. Right Sector leader Andriy
Tarasenko told me around the same time that 50,000 Ukrainians attend
vyshkoly militia camps, though this is likely a high estimate as it is
in revolutionaries' interest to exaggerate their own reputation.
Tarasenko has long been a weekend warrior in one of independent
Ukraine's oldest nationalist militias, Stepan Bandera's Trident.
University of Glasgow scholar Huseyn [Aliyev estimated that the militias
number 30,000](http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/151638/). To grasp why these
groups are able to have such an impact, it's important to understand
Ukrainian society and attitudes towards institutions. Ukraine is a
multi-ethnic country with tolerant voters, but they place a lot of trust
in volunteers -- which empowers fringe politics by marginal actors
operating largely on their own. The ability of powerful officials to act
individually should not be underestimated. Azov leader Biletskiy even
[threatened to overthrow the government again from the floor of
parliament in 2017](https://youtu.be/Xma2UwUHpsY).

### A2 K - EU link

#### There's no link -- the EU doesn't impose neoliberalism on member states

**Chu 17** ([Ben Chu](https://www.independent.co.uk/author/ben-chu),
Economics Editor of The Independent, 13 August 2017. The left-wing
argument for Brexit is embarrassingly flimsy,
https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/jeremy-corbyn-europe-lexit-brexit-a7890421.html

But this can't be happening, can it? This social democratic nirvana
can't exist. It must be our imagination playing tricks. Because as two
advocates of "[Lexit](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/lexit)" inform
us: "Any attempt to create a different kind of economy from inside the
EU has been forestalled through powerful legal impediments embodied in
the treaties." **[According to Corbyn supporters]{.underline}** [Joe
Guinan and Thomas
Hanna](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-lexit-left-wing-economics-end-of-neoliberalism-a7882111.html),
"**[the thrust of European economic policy has been to extend the market
through liberalisation, privatisation, and
flexibilisation,]{.underline}** subordinating employment and social
protection to low inflation, debt reduction and competitiveness."
**[What we have here is a delusion]{.underline}** -- and an extremely
dangerous one in the context of the finely-balanced UK politics of
[Brexit](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brexit). **[The reality is
that the EU is no impediment to]{.underline}** either the survival of
the institutions of **[social democracy]{.underline}** -- nor their
extension in Britain. We've had a clear demonstration of this only
recently. In **[2014, the population of the city of Hamburg
[voted](http://www.districtenergy.org/blogs/district-energy/2017/06/22/how-residents-of-hamburg-reclaimed-the-power-grid)
to return their power grid from private companies to municipal
hands]{.underline}**. Yet, strangely, **[the neo-liberal jackboots of
Brussels failed to crush the move]{.underline}**. It is fair to say that
**[Brussels]{.underline}** has a bias against monopoly -- and a good
thing, too. But it **[is certainly not opposed to public
ownership]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[a clause in the European treaty
[explicitly
states](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A12008E345)
that EU law must remain neutral on the question.]{.underline}** The
impediment that EU law imposes is that public providers have to be
treated on equal footing as privatised ones. On state aid, the
requirement is that subsidies to a sector must be available to all
operators, public and private alike. The Lexit case is embarrassingly
flimsy. Guinan and Hanna extol the possibilities for a flowering of
"community-owned firms" in the UK post-Brexit. But one can find
co-operatives [all over Europe](https://coopseurope.coop/about-us),
where they boast 123 million members.

#### The lefitist critique of the EU aligns the alternative with right-wing populism which guarantees the cooption of their movement. Even if the EU is has problems, criticizing it is a political dead end

Fassin's charge is not that today's left populists are secret
Thatcherites, nor even necessarily that their actions will lay the
groundwork for further neoliberal or right-wing gains. Rather, he
believes that the **[political strategy Mouffe advocates is premised on
a hopeless attempt to win a certain type of right-wing voter over to the
Left]{.underline}**. Many **[contemporary populist
movements]{.underline}** --- including those on the Left --- **[present
themselves as attempts to transcend the division between left and
right]{.underline}**. They could hardly do otherwise, since populism
seeks to recast the terms of political struggle as a "vertical"
opposition between the powerful and "the people," a category that cannot
plausibly be limited to the traditional bases of left or right parties,
whether defined in ideological or sociological terms. Mouffe and her
allies, then, are not only seeking to criticize the traditional
institutions of the Left for being out of touch with the people. They
aim to build an entirely new social base for the Left, one that is
independent of existing parties, unions, and associations, and that
includes all those impoverished and alienated from politics after
decades of neoliberalism. Among these ranks of the disaffected, Mouffe
and the politicians close to her claim to find many who have supported
populist movements of the Right. Though **[a great many far-right voters
are sincere racists, xenophobes, or neofascists, left populists
generally believe that it's both possible and necessary to provide an
alternate, anti-racist expression for the anger these people
feel.]{.underline}** Since unlike right populism, left populism
understands the real sources of this anger --- that is, neoliberalism
and its consequences --- it claims that its message will ultimately
prove more powerful to those who otherwise would vote for the likes of
Trump, Farage, and Le Pen. Fassin contends that **[this element of left
populist thinking is not only empirically false, but also politically
quixotic.]{.underline}** He argues that the common view of Donald
**[Trump's supporters as Americans "left behind" by neoliberal
globalization is a fiction. The typical Trump voter was not an
unemployed factory worker, but rather a middle- or upper-middle-class
white man]{.underline}**. But even were it factually true that far-right
voters were expressing a rejection of neoliberalism --- which Fassin
acknowledges is closer to reality in the case of the [Brexit
vote](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/02/brexit-uk-jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may-labour-ukip)
--- **[he believes there is a structural flaw in the left populist
strategy to win them over]{.underline}**. Like Mouffe and Laclau, he
believes that it's essential to take into account the role of passions
and emotions in politics. The passions he identifies behind the support
for far-right movements, however, are fundamentally irreconcilable with
those of the Left, populist or not. **[The far right is motivated
by]{.underline}** what Fassin calls "**[resentment]{.underline}**" ---
in other words, "the idea that there are others enjoying what is mine,
\[and that\] if I am not enjoying it, this is because of them." **[For
those who see the world in terms of resentment]{.underline}**, he
continues, **[the expression of "impotent rage" against these
undeserving others constitutes its own form of
"enjoyment."]{.underline}** For Fassin, this feeling of resentment is a
defining feature of the contemporary world. To a large extent, it has
resulted from the creation of relatively privileged classes in economic
terms who nonetheless lack what Pierre Bourdieu called "cultural
capital." Members of these classes --- depicted brilliantly by the
novelist Michel Houellebecq in his numerous white male protagonists ---
feel a profound insecurity, which produces a violent emotional response.
They come to hate both highly educated liberals for parading their
cultural elitism and progressive values in their faces, and the
underprivileged classes that these "woke" elites appear to care about
more than them. **[It is no mere historical accident, then, that
populism played a key role in the construction of neoliberalism under
the right-wing governments of the 1980s]{.underline}**. As a political
rhetoric and praxis, **[populism is inherently cultural]{.underline}**,
Fassin explains, **[which has made it an ideal tool for right-wingers
from Reagan and Thatcher to Trump]{.underline}**. The Right's primary
intention over the last four or so decades has been to mobilize the
white middle classes for the benefit of the neoliberal elite, and
cultural populism made it possible to present this effort as a defense
of "the people" against decadent liberals and the black and brown
underclasses. **[Fassin therefore dismisses the left populist idea that
there is a base of far-right supporters whose anger can be diverted from
racist populist movements to egalitarian ones. There is no subconscious
desire for economic justice underneath a vote for Donald Trump or the
Front National, only resentment towards perceived cultural superiors and
racial inferiors]{.underline}**. For Fassin, populism simply is
resentment. Leftists can dress their ideas in populist rhetoric all they
want --- they can, for example, personalize their critique of
neoliberalism by denouncing members of "the oligarchy" and their
cultural worldview. But **[Fassin insists that to the extent that the
Left chooses to go this route, it sacrifices properly leftist
ideas]{.underline}** and methods for a rhetoric of cultural warfare that
originated on the far right, **[but can never satisfy the resentments
and insecurities the far right feeds on]{.underline}**.

[The Trump administration continues to be an administration in
transition]{.underline}. It has taken the new President and his
entourage a prolonged period of time to settle in. [The new
administration has not yet managed to formulate something approximating
a comprehensive U.S. foreign policy and a "grand strategy" for
establishing a new global order]{.underline}. However, preceding
administrations have also found this difficult and almost impossible to
achieve. [The Trump White House is divided between an ideological wing
and a more pragmatic faction with the President unable to decide which
faction to side with. Secretary of State Tillerson has made clear that
Trump's "America First" foreign policy is all about U.S. national
security and prosperity]{.underline}. The Trump administration, it
seems, has very little inclination to base U.S. foreign policy on the

Conclusion

[[Putin's system may soon be under real existential threat]{.mark} for
the first time. In the winter 2011-12 demonstrations the system's
economic and political fundamentals were sound -- not now. In
circumstances of [crisis politics]{.mark} with his survival at risk,
[Putin **will push the envelope**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- as he did in
Crimea -- and perhaps [**[beyond the breaking point]{.mark}**. He will
crackdown on the domestic opposition and [purge Russia of foreign
entities]{.mark}, [institutionalizing isolation from the
West]{.mark}]{.underline} to the extent necessary. In foreign relations,
defeat in Ukraine is unacceptable, [and]{.mark} [Putin can be expected
to **repeatedly [up the ante]{.mark}** [in any escalation of the
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. The same may be true [in the event that
domestic problems such as]{.underline} a collapse of the ruble or [full
economic depression challenge his and his system's survival. [This
could]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[provoke him into]{.underline}]{.mark}
one of several optional gambits in Ukraine, [global [confrontation with
the West from Eurasia to the Western Hemisphere]{.mark}]{.underline},
[or [asymmetrical escalation]{.mark} elsewhere [in Eurasia or beyond
against Western interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given the above, the
West would do well to beef up its military preparedness, step up efforts
to negotiate a settlement in Ukraine, and put an end to sanctions and
other measures that might lead to state breakdown in chemical-,
biological-, radiological-, and nuclear-laden Russia. [Armageddon was
averted during the Soviet regime and state breakdown in 1991. [There is
**no guarantee** a second brush with Armageddon will end
well]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this light, the West needs to ask itself a
fundamental question: Is Ukraine's membership in NATO and/or the EU
worth such a risk?

**Gitlin 3** -- Professor Sociology at Columbia

(Todd, July, "Goodbye, New World Order: Keep the Global Ideal Alive"
MotherJones,
http://www.motherjones.com/commentary/gitlin/2003/07/we_478_01.html)

The point is that this would be a terrible time to give up on
internationalism. The simple fact that the US proved victorious in Iraq
does not alter the following chain of truths: To push the world toward
democratic rights, power must be legitimate; it is only legitimate if it
is held to be legitimate; it is very unlikely to be legitimate if it is
unilateral or close to unilateral; and the wider the base of power, the
more likely it is to appear legitimate. Bush may have no doubt that
American armed force in the Middle East is legitimate, and right now
Americans may agree, but that won\'t do. Common sense alone should tell
us not to overreach. Even with the best intentions in the world \--
which hundreds of millions doubt \-- the United States is simply not up
to the global mission that the Bush administration embraces. This nation
hasn\'t the staying power, the economic strength, the knowledge, the
wisdom, or the legitimacy to command the continents. It is sheerest
delusion to think otherwise. Meanwhile, it is an irony of the recent
past that as the United States has lost prestige, the United Nations has
gained it \-- at least outside our borders. For all its demonstrable
flaws, it retains some credibility \-- no small thing in a world growing
more anarchic. Even [[the U. N.]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s sharpest critics
concede that it learns from its mistakes. Having [[failed]{.mark}
miserably [to]{.mark} [stop ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and
Rwanda]{.mark}]{.underline}, it started talking about the need to keep
constabulary forces at the ready. Having been assigned much of the
world\'s dirty work \-- [peacekeeping, public health, refugee and
humanitarian aid \-- [its institutions accumulate the lore of
experience.]{.mark}]{.underline} Resolution 1441, which the Security
Council passed unanimously last year, might even be interpreted, strange
to say, as a step forward in the enforcement of [[i]{.mark}nternational
[law]{.mark}]{.underline}, for if the U. S. had been more adroit and
patient diplomatically, the French and others could have been nudged
into signing onto limited force a few months hence. In the end, the
organization [[failed]{.mark} to prevent war]{.underline}, but its hopes
have never been more necessary, its resurrection more indispensable. If
internationalism is toothless, right now, that\'s not an argument
against internationalist principle; it\'s an argument for implanting
teeth. If what\'s left on the East River is nothing but a clunky hulk,
there was still enough prestige left in the hulk that George W. Bush,
master unilateralist, felt impelled to dally with the Security Council
\-- however reluctantly, however deceptively \-- for months. No less a
figure than his father\'s consigliore and former Secretary of State
James W. Baker urged that course upon the president last summer. Going
the Security Council route was the tribute George W. Bush paid to
internationalism \-- before underscoring his contempt for it by going to
war on his own schedule. This is not the first time an international
assembly of nation-states has failed abjectly to prove its mettle.
Indeed, in 1945, the UN itself was built atop the site of an earlier
breakdown. The [[rubble of the]{.mark} collapsed [League]{.mark} of
Nations, which had failed to arrest blatant aggression by Italy, Japan,
and Germany, [had to be cleared]{.mark} away before the UN could rise
from the ashes]{.underline}. Yet rise it did. And people were inspired
\-- and frightened \-- by it. Even as a spectral presence, the UN was
substantial enough to arouse right-wingers to put up billboards urging
the US to flee its clutches. Recently, George W. Bush fondly remembered
those signs, conspicuous around Midland, Texas, during his early years.
To Midland\'s America Firsters, the U. N. had a reputation as demonic as
it was, to this writer, benign. In the General Assembly building, which
my friends and I frequented in high school, the ceiling was left
unfinished \-- to signal, we were told, that [world peace was
unfinished. [What if the symbolism was]{.mark} indeed [a pointer toward
a different order]{.mark} of things[?]{.mark}]{.underline} It is not
always easy to tell the difference between dead symbols and promising
ones. Push came to shove, and the [UN was]{.underline} mainly an
intimation \-- [at most an inspiration. Neither as peacemaker nor
peacekeeper was it the world government-in-the-making that some desired
and others feared.]{.underline} It was a force in Korea only because the
Russians agreed not to play. [[It was useless in Vietnam]{.mark}. During
[the]{.mark} endless [Israel-Palestine war]{.mark}, it has been
bootless]{.underline}. In the 1990s, [it failed miserably to stop [Serb
aggression in Bosnia]{.mark} [and Kosovo]{.mark}.]{.underline} [It stood
by during [the Rwandan genocide]{.mark}]{.underline}, too, though its
own military commander on the scene, Canadian General Romeo Dallaire,
pleaded desperately for UN reinforcements. [[You can see why
realists]{.mark} like to [smirk and claim it\'s]{.mark} hopelessly
[idealistic to think]{.mark} that [the UN could ever amount to anything
more than a debating society]{.mark} whose main achievement has been to
reserve a lot of Manhattan parking spots.]{.underline} Interestingly,
Dallaire, who was shattered by UN failure in Rwanda, does not sneer. In
retirement, he continues campaigning to strengthen world governance.
\"You can\'t on one side, say the UN is screwing it up and we\'re going
to go to war, and on other side not give the UN the resources,\" he said
recently. \"It is not the UN that failed \[in Iraq\]. But it is the
permanent five \[members of the Security Council\] in particular. If
they don\'t want the UN to be effective, it won\'t be.\" Pause with this
elementary observation a moment. The reasons for the UN\'s weakness are
several, but not the least is that \-- no surprise here \-- the most
powerful nations want it weak. They like the principle of national
sovereignty, and then some, as the recent war amply demonstrates. It
will take a long, steady, popular campaign to override the inhibitions.
Campaigners might start by underscoring some modest successes. For all
the impediments thrown in its way \-- and not only by the US \-- the UN
has done constructive work. It helped restore decent governments in
Cambodia, East Timor, and Bosnia. It helps keep the peace on the Golan
Heights. On a thousand unnoticed fronts, it daily comes to the aid of
refugees, the sick, the malnourished. A top UN official recently told me
that Secretary General Kofi Annan was inches away from a
partition-ending deal in long-suffering Cyprus, only to lose momentum
with the distraction of the Bush-Saddam confrontation. In Afghanistan
and Iraq, we need not less of the UN, but much more \-- more efficient,
better led, better funded. Rebuild The Destroyed Nations: Now there\'s
an agenda for a peace movement. But much of the global movement that
sprang up to oppose the Iraq war proceeded to subside into easy chants
of \"US Out\" \-- an analogue to the right wing\'s \"US Out of the UN.\"
This sort of short-circuit unilateralism begs the tough questions about
the uses (as well as abuses) of international intervention. \"US Out\"
resounds more ringingly if you refrain from thinking about what actual
Afghans and actual Iraqis need \-- constitutional rights, law
enforcement, infrastructure. [[Protest has its time and place, but
what\'s needed]{.mark} now [is politics]{.mark}]{.underline} \--
politics to plan the unilateralists\' exit from office, combined with
practical pressure, here and now, to solve practical problems[. **[We
must not]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[permit ourselves to [retreat]{.mark}
noisily [into protest\'s good night]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Most of all,
internationalism needs more than a nudge here and there \-- it needs a
jump-start, a riveting proof that multilateral action can change facts
on the ground. Here\'s one idea: What if the UN and Europe decided to
take on the toughest assignment? There is no more stringent test for
internationalism\'s future than what seems the world\'s most intractable
trauma: The endless Israel-Palestine war, which has outlasted a thousand
manifestos, plans, meetings about meetings. The new postwar situation
might just be promising, the Bush administration just possibly
susceptible to pressure. Practical, peace-seeking Jews and Palestinians
ought to get in on the pressure; so should Europeans looking for
payback, not least Tony Blair. And we ought to be thinking of a
practical role for a UN, or joint UN-NATO constabulary. As Tony Klug of
Britain\'s Council for Jewish-Palestinian Dialogue has pointed out on
openDemocracy.net, the two bloodied, intertwined, myopic peoples need
far more than a road map: they need enforcement. Klug\'s idea is an
international protectorate for the West Bank and Gaza. Some combination
of the UN, NATO, and various national forces would play various parts.
The point would be to supplant the Israeli occupation, relieve the
immediate suffering, and guarantee secure borders. Such a scheme would
seem to have taken leave of this earth. The U. S. won\'t permit
it\....Sharon won\'t permit it\....The Europeans won\'t pay for
it\....The Israelis won\'t trust the UN, or the Palestinians, who won\'t
trust the Israeli. But [[**what is the alternative?** More]{.mark}
living [nightmares? **Occupation and massacre in perpetuity?**]{.mark}
Military [enforcement]{.mark} on a global scale has been [left to ad hoc
coalitions]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- sometimes with blue helmets,
sometimes not. [[**That won\'t do**. To put]{.mark} human [rights on the
ground, avert genocides]{.mark} to come, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} \--
not incidentally \-- [help [protect]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [[from]{.mark} the [more vengeful]{.mark} of
[empire\'s]{.mark} resentful subjects]{.underline} (funny, their not
understanding how good our power is for them), **[[we need a]{.mark}
more [muscular global authority]{.mark}]{.underline}** \-- including a
global constabulary. Imagine, say, a flexible force permitted to commit,
say, 10,000 troops if a simple majority, eight members, of the Security
Council signed on, but expandable to 50,000 if the vote were unanimous.
Wouldn\'t Europe have been in a stronger position to avert Bush\'s war
if such a force had been in readiness to enforce resolutions of the
Security Council? A wise superpower would know it needs to share
responsibility \-- which entails sharing the force that makes
responsibility real. Of course such a denouement is scarcely around the
corner, nor is there any guarantee that it is destined to come at all.
Like the abolition of slavery, or the unity of Europe, it surely will
not come without pain or error, nor will it be the work of a single
generation. But again, [[what is the alternative? **Tyranny and
unilateralism**; **hubris and mile-high resentment**. In the world as it
is, effective moral force cannot preclude military
force]{.underline}]{.mark}. If internationalists don\'t press more
strongly for international law and multilateralist order, one thing is
certain: [[we shall be left with protests, playing catch-up forever,
waiting for \"told you so\" moments. **\"No\" is not a foreign
policy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Coupled with the properly skeptical
\"no\" must be the transformative \"yes\" \-- not a grudging,
perfunctory afterthought, but international law with enforcers; not
empire, but human rights with guns.

\"[[Liberal interventionists are just]{.mark} \'kinder, [gentler\'
neocons]{.mark}, and neocons are just liberal
interventionists]{.underline} on steroids,\" political scientist and
blogger Stephen M. [[Walt]{.underline}]{.mark}, commenting on calls for
U.S. involvement in Libya, [[asserted]{.underline}]{.mark} recently on
this website, [[echoing a false equivalence that has]{.mark} sadly
[become]{.mark} a [common]{.mark} conceit]{.underline} among
foreign-policy thinkers. [[It was inevitable that pundits would
compare]{.mark} the invasion of [Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline} (an idea
promoted by neoconservatives) [[to]{.mark} the imposition of a no-fly
zone in [Libya]{.mark}]{.underline} (an idea promoted by liberal
interventionists). [[Yet obscuring the difference between these]{.mark}
two schools of thought [threatens]{.mark} more than the vanity of a
group of academics: It places the coherence and [stability]{.mark} of
the United States\' long-term grand strategy in jeopardy.¶]{.underline}
While Walt, a self-identified \"realist,\" develops a more sophisticated
version of this false equivalence, [[there are]{.underline},]{.mark} of
course, **[obvious]{.underline}** [**[fundamental
differences]{.underline}** [between]{.underline}
[neocons\']{.underline}]{.mark} [triumphal [nationalism and liberals\'
conviction that America can]{.mark} best [advance its interests]{.mark}
and values [in cooperation with]{.mark} other
[democracies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Walt concedes the distinction, only
to accuse liberals of being more cunning than neocons about concealing
their will to power: \"\[T\]he former have disdain for international
institutions (which they see as constraints on U.S. power), and the
latter see them as a useful way to legitimate American dominance.\"¶
[[In Walt\'s estimation, **intervention is intervention, no matter
the**]{.mark} **avowed [motives]{.mark} behind a given mission,
[or]{.mark} the various [circumstances]{.mark} that can justify the use
of force.**]{.underline} [Because]{.underline} George W. [Bush
and]{.underline} Barack [Obama have each initiated a military action, it
follows for Walt that neocons and \"liberal interventionists\" see the
world much the same way]{.underline}.¶ [[**This is bunk**.]{.mark}
Traumatized by U.S. blunders in Iraq, realists now misapply that war\'s
lessons to Obama\'s decision to join international efforts to protect
Libyans]{.underline} from the wrath of a mad dictator. While the
president is being attacked by everyone from John Boehner to Dennis
Kucinich, it is critical to set the record straight.¶ Because Walt uses
the terms \"liberal interventionist\" or \"liberal hawk\" pejoratively,
I\'ll refer to \"progressive internationalism\" instead. Progressive
internationalists aren\'t hard-core lefties, but rather progressives in
the original sense of the word: [[pragmatic
liberals]{.underline}]{.mark}. We [[are **ideological
moderates**]{.mark} rooted in]{.underline} classically liberal
understandings of individual liberty and equality of opportunity \-- at
home and abroad \-- [who believe the world\'s [problems should be solved
through]{.mark} **tough-minded [diplomacy]{.mark} and negotiation,
whenever possible**.¶]{.underline} Further, [the terms \"hawk\" or
\"interventionist\" imply an overreliance on the military. Walt accuses
both neocons and progressive internationalists of looking at **every
problem as a nail to be pounded by the hammer of U.S. military**
**might**]{.underline}. While progressive [[internationalists]{.mark}
certainly support a strong military]{.underline} as the bedrock of
America\'s foreign policy, **[they also [know that international
affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the 21st century **[[seldom present
black-and-white binary decisions]{.mark} of the sort that Bush
mistakenly sought to resolve with a good whack.¶]{.underline}** This no
doubt brings to mind Iraq, and I cannot go further without acknowledging
the elephant in the room: [Yes, many progressive internationalists did
support the decision to invade Iraq]{.underline}. (In 2003, I was a
civilian counterterrorism analyst at the Department of Defense and did
not take a public position on that action.) In hindsight, I believe
constructive critique of my colleagues is warranted and they have
learned much in Iraq\'s wake. The only point I offer in their defense is
this: [It\'s just hard to imagine that an Al Gore
administration]{.underline} \-- which would have been stocked full of
progressive internationalists \-- [would have ginned up that ideological
charge to war.¶ Progressive internationalists recognize that U.S.
[foreign policy is now a holistic enterprise that must]{.mark} first
[summon all sources of national power]{.mark} to deal with what goes on
within states as well as between them \-- direct and multilateral
[diplomacy]{.mark}, [development aid to build]{.mark} infrastructure and
[civil society]{.mark}]{.underline}, trade to promote growth,
intelligence collection, and law enforcement, to name a few \-- [[and
**only then turn to force as the final guarantor**]{.mark} **of peace
and stability**]{.underline}.¶ Neocons, however, disdain multilateral
diplomacy and overestimate the efficacy of military force. Their
lopsided preoccupation with \"hard power\" creates an imposing facade of
strength, but in fact saps the economic, political, and moral sources of
American influence. By overspending on the military and allowing the
other levers of American power to atrophy, neocons misallocate precious
U.S. national resources in two ways \-- leaving the United States with
too little of the \"smart power\" capacities desperately needed in war
zones like Afghanistan and an overabundance of \"hard power\" capacities
it will never use. The trick is to carefully cultivate both, as Defense
Secretary Robert Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Mike Mullen have championed since
Obama took power.¶ Walt allows some daylight between neocons and
progressive internationalists in their willingness to defer to
international institutions, but he again misses the true difference. He
rightly characterizes neocons\' disdain for multilateral talking shops
(see: John Bolton) but wrongly suggests progressives are insincere in
embedding U.S. power in international institutions. The fact is that we
do indeed believe that international institutions make the world a safer
place for the United States and other democracies by entrenching liberal
norms around the globe. Can it really be an accident that America is
embroiled in conflicts across the Middle East, a region whose countries
are least touched by liberal democracy and adherence to
internationalism?¶ Progressive internationalists believe the United
States should be the unquestioned vanguard of democratic values, and
that American leadership is strengthened when granted a sense of
legitimacy that attracts others to our cause. Without a doubt,
unilateral application of force in self-defense is a legitimate exercise
of power, but legitimacy can evaporate under two circumstances: when
America\'s actions betray its core values or when America acts
offensively without an international mandate and the backing of close
allies. My organization, the Progressive Policy Institute, in a 2003
manifesto on progressive internationalism, argued that \"the way to keep
America safe and strong is not to impose our will on others or pursue a
narrow, selfish nationalism that betrays our best values, but to lead
the world toward political and economic freedom.\"¶ Neocons, by
contrast, pursue security interests at the expense of American values
and damage U.S. legitimacy while doing so. That was George W. Bush: He
betrayed American values and alienated core international partners by
torturing prisoners, denying them any sense of due process, and
falsifying a threat to justify an effectively unilateral invasion of a
Muslim country. He strove for the mere appearance of legitimacy, forging
ham-fisted, bribed coalitions of the somewhat willing.¶ The Obama
administration\'s actions in Libya are surely legitimate. The president
chose to intervene after securing active support from the Arab League,
the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and the Gulf Cooperation
Council, not to mention the U.N. Security Council. The international
community\'s near-unanimity is an acknowledgement of the
\"responsibility to protect\" (or R2P), a U.N. norm that obliges the
international community to defend innocents in the face of humanitarian
atrocities.¶ Realists like Walt disdain R2P because shielding other
human beings from mass murder does not fit within the realists\' narrow
band of core American interests. To them, America\'s blood, attention,
and treasure are not worth spending unless there is an immediate quid
pro quo payoff in terms of national security. Ironically for Walt,
realists are closer to neoconservatives on this score: Bush and Cheney
meshed realism with neoconservatism when they sold the Iraq invasion as
a quick and painless exercise of overwhelming American power that would
render an immediate payoff in the form of a decapitated threat and an
instantaneous \"beacon of democracy\" in the Middle East.¶ Progressive
internationalists, like neocons, would define R2P as a core national
interest, and we would both advocate strongly for the protection of
innocent civilians who yearn to express their individual freedoms. We
believe protecting civilians from murderous dictators creates a more
stable international community and a safer America while promoting
universal human rights and values. But though our ends are similar, our
thresholds for intervention, our military methodology, and our
justifications for action could not be more different.
Neoconservatives\' disdain for smart power and realists\' shortsighted
interpretation of core U.S. interests are poor uses of national
resources. In contrast, progressive internationalists seek to use all of
America\'s might to shape an international environment more congenial to

Vladimir \[in\] [Putin's war against Ukraine has now entered its sixth
year. This is not a frozen conflict]{.underline}. More than 10,000
Ukrainians have been killed, and that number grows each week. And on
Nov. 25 of last year, the Kremlin leader escalated his war of
aggression, and even expanded it into a new
[domain](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/04/us-russia-navy-ukraine-putin-226538)
by attacking and seizing three Ukrainian naval vessels and detaining 24
Ukrainian sailors in violation of international law. They remain Putin's
captives. Finally, more than 100 days since that attack, the free world
has begun to respond. I welcome President Donald Trump's recent
decision, along with our Canadian and European allies, to impose
additional [sanctions on Russian]{.underline} officials. This [is a
powerful first step]{.underline}. [But it must not be the only
step]{.underline}. [The free world must respond with urgency and
strength]{.underline} --- [not just to a single attack, but to Putin's
broader campaign to undermine Ukrainian sovereignty and the free
institutions the country seeks to join]{.underline}. Additional U.S.
sanctions must be on the table to impose direct costs on Putin and his
henchmen. [We should also work closely with the NATO alliance to
**enhance** our military presence and capabilities in the Black Sea
region]{.underline}. [Most of all, the United States should develop a
long-term plan for security assistance to Ukraine --- a plan that truly
reflects the stakes of this conflict not just for Ukraine, but for the
United States]{.underline}. Last year, Ukraine received its first lethal
aid from the United States thanks to the Trump administration's approval
of a sale of Javelin anti-tank missiles --- a critical step the Obama
administration refused to take despite bipartisan support in Congress.
The Trump administration also notified Congress in February that, for
the first time since its creation in 2015, funds for [the Department of
Defense's Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative will be used to provide
lethal aid, including sniper rifles and shoulder-fired grenade
launchers]{.underline}. I commend the administration for these two
"firsts." [Now it's time to **increase funding** for the Ukraine
Security Assistance Initiative, as well as the State Department's
[security](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/04/us-russia-navy-ukraine-putin-226538)
assistance programs]{.underline}. [And a larger share of this funding
should go to support defensive lethal aid that will make Ukraine a more
difficult target for Putin's aggression]{.underline}. [After Putin's
Black Sea attack, Ukraine's maritime capabilities must be enhanced by
accelerating acquisition of coastal defense radars, patrol boats,
coastal defense and anti-ship missiles and other systems]{.underline}.
[On the ground, Ukraine needs more Javelins, other anti-tank weapons,
[electronic
warfare](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/04/us-russia-navy-ukraine-putin-226538)
systems and advanced counterartillery radars]{.underline}. [And in the
air, we should examine how to assist Ukraine in improving its air
defenses]{.underline}. Of course, the response of the free world to
Putin's aggression is not the responsibility of the United States alone.
Canada, Lithuania, Poland and the United Kingdom have been providing
security resources to Ukraine. [We need more allies and partners to step
up with action rather than talk]{.underline}. Our European allies and
partners should ban all Russian Navy vessels from their ports. Many of
these ships home-port in illegally annexed Ukrainian territory. These
ships fire missiles into Syria to keep the murderer Bashar Assad in
power. Putin's
[warships](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/04/us-russia-navy-ukraine-putin-226538)
do not belong in the ports of the free world. And until Ukraine's
sailors and ships are returned, our European allies should extend that
ban to Russian commercial ships originating from the Black Sea. Perhaps
the most powerful step our European partners could take would be to
cancel the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will strengthen Russia's grip
on the European energy market and place Ukraine's economic and [physical
security](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/04/us-russia-navy-ukraine-putin-226538)
at greater risk. I hope this project will be stopped, but in the
meantime, I urge European leaders to strictly apply European energy law
to the pipeline, insist on greater transparency and demand the operation
of the pipeline be truly independent of Gazprom, Putin's corrupt gas
syndicate. The Ukrainian people further turned their backs to Russia in
their elections this past weekend, resoundingly rejecting the only
candidate supporting a closer relationship with Putin. But the country
can also do more to strengthen its own defense against Russian
aggression and malign influence by staying on the path of reform and
cleaning up corruption. Nothing, however, can diminish the sacrifices
made by the people of Ukraine, nor the extraordinary courage and resolve
they have shown through five difficult years of war. [Ukrainians are
fighting]{.underline}, as the beloved Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko
once put it, to join "the family of the free." In this fight, Ukraine
needs [and deserves our help]{.underline}.

[Russia's war with Ukraine]{.underline} has entered its sixth year, and
[despite the asymmetrical nature]{.underline} of the conflict, it [has
reached a stalemate]{.underline}. Russian President Vladimir Putin has
clearly breached all international laws, but [nobody wants to do the
heavy lifting required to dislodge Putin from]{.underline} the [occupied
territories.]{.underline} To Ukrainians, now entering the second round
of their presidential election, the war is second only to corruption as
the most important issue facing their nation. Each candidate must now
detail his blueprint to resolve the lingering and costly conflict.
[President]{.underline} Petro Poroshenko has vowed to fight until the
territories are returned and join NATO, and frontrunner Volodymyr
[Zelenskiy wants the territories returned, has pledged to hold a
referendum on joining NATO, and says he's willing to talk with
Putin.]{.underline} Several [US military experts were asked about the
best way forward]{.underline} and were divided as to priorities: [More
military aid, more diplomacy, more sanctions, a clean-up of Ukrainian
corruption, or all in varying degrees.]{.underline} "I don't think it is
complicated," said Phillip Karber, a defense advisor to NATO governments
and president of the Potomac Foundation. Karber has been in Ukraine
thirty times, including spending one winter at the front. "[Nothing is
going to change until Putin decides he's not going to do it
anymore]{.underline}." Karber said that [**the West must find ways to
increase the costs on Putin in the Donbas.** Karber
suggested]{.underline} that [vehicles, missiles, and equipment, now in
storage in the United States, should be shipped to Ukraine]{.underline},
at no cost to the US taxpayer. He suggested that [400
"Bradleys]{.underline}" or tanks; [24 Cobras]{.underline} (attack
helicopters); [six Hawkeyes]{.underline} (airborne command and control
system); [and 70 Harpoon missiles]{.underline} (anti-ship weapons on
fighter bombers) [would]{.underline} help [equalize the situation for
Ukraine.]{.underline} "All of a sudden [the situation would be very
different]{.underline}," he said. "**[This increase wouldn't be an
escalation but reciprocity]{.underline}**." US Special Representative to
Ukraine Kurt Volker emphasized a mixture of diplomacy, military defense,
and sanctions. "I don\'t want Ukraine to launch a new military offensive
because it will lose," he said in an interview. "But [Ukraine should
strengthen its defensive capability to provide a strong deterrent to
Russian aggression]{.underline}. Holding the ground, [raising the costs
to Russia]{.underline}." He said diplomacy remains important and that
the Ukrainian government should remain committed to the Minsk
Agreements, and support the proposal for a UN mandated peacekeeping
mission. "The active fighting should stop in the Donbas. Crimea is on a
different trajectory and that involves sanctions," he added.
Unfortunately, the reality is that [Putin holds all the cards at the
moment]{.underline}. [Ukraine is years away from being qualified to join
NATO]{.underline}, and the United States and Britain failed to enforce
the Budapest Memorandum which promised protection for Ukraine in 1994
after it surrendered its nuclear weapons. After the 2014 invasion, [the
Obama regime refused to supply lethal defensive weapons,]{.underline}
due to worries about Russia's reaction. One year ago, the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [made a small step by delivering
lethal defensive weapons]{.underline}, or thirty Javelin anti-tank
missile systems. But little changed on the ground. [Fighting
continued]{.underline} and in November [Russia seized]{.underline}
Ukrainian [ships and sailors to blockade and control
shipping]{.underline} in two Ukrainian ports. Some speculate [this is in
preparation to seize more territory.]{.underline} Michael Carpenter,
senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global
Engagement and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense at the
Department of Defense, believes the conflict suits Russia's purpose.
"[Their ideal solution is a Kyiv government subservient to the
Kremlin]{.underline}," he said. [Ukraine needs more military help and
the current sanctions on Russia are not tough enough]{.underline},
Carpenter said. "[Full blocking sanctions to even one major Russian
bank, or prohibition on all financial transactions by major Russian
banks, would have a huge impact on financial markets and give us greater
leverage]{.underline}," said Carpenter. "Instead, we sanctioned Russia's
26th largest bank, a crony bank in Russia, but so small it was easy
\[for cronies\] to reconfigure portfolios." By contrast, he added,
sanctions against Iran worked. They brought the country to the
negotiating table and shrank its economy 9 percent a year for three
years, shrank oil exports from 2.5 million to 1.1 million barrels a day,
and froze \$120 billion in Iranian reserves abroad. Ben Hodges, a
retired general and former commander of the United States Army in
Europe, agreed that Putin remains undaunted. He added that Ukraine's
systemic corruption does not help its cause. "I think Ukraine's effort
is undermined by the level of corruption and perception of corruption
there. And the Russians exploit this. The recent scandal, involving the
defense bureaucracy, wrecks morale and harms the competence of the
people in Ukraine. And in the West, there is a danger of Ukraine fatigue
as corruption continues." Hodges said the Kharkiv tank factory
illustrates what's not working. There workers repair battle-damaged
tanks for the Ukrainian army but also produce new top shelf tanks for
export. "Yet the \[Ukrainian\] government has been asking the West to
provide basic equipment. Something is wrong with the system. There is
zero transparency of its defense budget. This needs to be addressed."
Going forward, Ukraine's next president must not only make it clear to
allies that [Russia represents an existential threat against
Ukraine]{.underline}, but [also against the rest of Europe]{.underline}.
[The case for more military]{.underline}, diplomatic, sanctions, and
[aid must be made forcefully and often]{.underline}. As a recent article
by Dennis Soltys of KIMEP University in Kazakhstan put it: "[The
Ukrainian civilian population and under-equipped army conveniently guard
Europe's eastern wall]{.underline}. But [such]{.underline} an [effort
cannot be sustained indefinitely by a poor country with a population
less than one-third that of Russia's]{.underline}. Thus, [Western
military and economic aid is necessary]{.underline}." Volker agrees.
"Much higher on Europe's list of priorities should be to make Ukraine
strong. Europe is not doing enough." [Ukraine protects Europe and now
Europe,]{.underline} [and its allies, must protect Ukrainians in return.
Without that reciprocity, winter will come.]{.underline}

Investment? ,\" Atlantic Council, FEBRUARY 22, 2019,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/is-the-ukrainian-army-worthy-of-greater-investment
dw

Last year Washington finally gave Kyiv the javelin missiles it had been
begging for. But [the javelins are mostly symbolic and won't
change]{.underline} much on [the frontlines]{.underline}. For more than
six months, [Washington has been talking about giving Ukraine additional
arms to improve its air and naval defenses]{.underline}. These arms are
more likely after Russian ships attacked Ukrainian ones in November
2018. Some experts have put together lists of equipment that the United
States could easily give or transfer. But before we get ahead of
ourselves, Congress may wonder if the Ukrainian army is any good and
whether the funds will go to waste. [Is the Ukrainian army worthy of
greater investment?]{.underline} In a word, [yes]{.underline}. With a
total of 250,000 personnel, [Ukraine's army is a strong fighting
force]{.underline}, the third largest in Europe after the Russian and
French militaries. [Most military experts agree that the Ukrainian army
could impose high costs on Russia in a defensive war]{.underline}.
Simultaneously, however---and more important---[Ukraine's
military]{.underline} is a "people's army," one that has the backing of
civil society and is the most trusted institution. In many ways, it
[serves as a bridge between government and the public---and it is
helping to keep the peace throughout Europe]{.underline}. None of that
was true when the Russian army backed separatists in the Donbas in 2014.
Back then, the Ukrainian army consisted of poorly equipped conscripts
who had been demoralized after years of neglect by governments in Kyiv.
At the time, hastily formed volunteer battalions took on some of the
earliest fighting, until the regular army could find its feet. Field
units fought essentially uncoordinated local battles against the
separatist-Russian forces directly in front of them; casualties were
unnecessarily high. Nonetheless, while accounts vary, it appears that
the Ukrainians inflicted significant losses on the attackers. After the
USSR imploded, Ukraine inherited some of the most modern segments of the
Soviet military industrial complex, namely precision weapons, missile
guidance systems, radars, and electronics. The ground forces are now at
least adequately supplied with tanks and armored vehicles, and priority
has shifted to air defense. Producing its own components, Ukraine has
modernized or developed short and medium-range anti-aircraft systems, a
tactical ballistic missile, and a multiple-use cruise missile. Serial
production of these weapons is either just beginning or is one or two
years away, but quantities will be constrained by lack of finances.
Perhaps worse than financial constraints is an outdated military
bureaucracy and culture that emphasizes force concentration and
subordination rather than a flexible type of warfare that is possible
with motivated citizen-soldiers. Symptomatically, as many as 80 percent
of contractees do not renew their contracts, mostly out of frustration
with the poor command. The upper command's ability to coordinate forces
over a large theater within high-intensity warfare is questionable. But
[Ukraine's army is]{.underline} perhaps [more interesting as a political
institution than a combat one]{.underline}. It [is composed mainly of
ethnic Ukrainians]{.underline}, making the army more cohesive than the
general population. Because [the army is now largely a volunteer
one]{.underline}, motivated recruits self-select into the ranks. A test
of the military's values occurred during the 2014 Euromaidan, when the
army refused to support the authoritarian regime led by President Victor
Yanukovych and suppress social dissent. Another test occurred that year
when volunteer battalions and the army dared to defy the intimidating
Russian forces, whose Soviet ancestors once rolled over countries in
Eastern Europe at will. [The army survived the early rounds of the
war]{.underline} partly [because the civilian population rallied to
repair vehicles]{.underline}, [provide clothing, and buy personal
equipment]{.underline} [for the soldiers]{.underline} such as armored
vests and night-vision goggles. Civilian volunteers braved danger to
transport the equipment to the front and arrange its distribution. To
its credit, the Ministry of Defense was one of the first government
ministries to participate in online procurement through ProZorro, which
tracks the supply and feeding of the army. Of necessity, [the largest
proportion of NGOs and volunteer organizations in Ukraine are
concerned]{.underline} in some way [with defense issues]{.underline}.
[Most volunteer battalions have been integrated into the regular army,
and relations between the army and civilian population in the liberated
zones of the Donbas are good. The result is a cohesive front. The army
and nation have sacrificed too much to watch the government give
to]{.underline} the [Kremlin]{.underline} at the negotiating table what
was paid for on the battlefield. [Ukrainian defense]{.underline}
officials have [estimated that]{.underline} in [a full-scale attack by
Russia]{.underline}, [the Ukrainian army could lose 15,000 soldiers in
three week]{.underline}s; but [the population is psychologically
prepared for such a scenario]{.underline}. For its part, the Kremlin
must realize that if it were to cause more destruction in Ukraine, it
would utterly lose the affection of the population; at the same time,
the Ukrainian army would draw the teeth of the Russian army and economy
even in retreat. Nonetheless, [there is no prospect of NATO membership
in the near future]{.underline}. And given the West's failure to enforce
the Budapest Memorandum, whereby Ukraine forfeited its nuclear weapons
for security "assurances," NATO is not a credible ally in any case. NATO
is useful, and essential, for joint weapons development and training,
which are about as much as can be expected from it. Considering that the
West declines to supply more than symbolic levels of lethal weapons, it
is understandable that President Petro Poroshenko aspires to build his
country's military industry. Meanwhile, [Europe gets a free ride on the
Ukrainian army's defense effort]{.underline}. Ukrainians have shown that
Russia can be resisted; [this is heartening to the Baltic countries and
reduces defeatism more broadly in Eastern Europe]{.underline}. Western
[Europeans can have]{.underline} both [economic relations with Russia
and military security]{.underline}, for [their security risks have been
externalized to the Ukrainian army]{.underline}. This perhaps explains
Western Europeans' complacency in the face of Russian threats. In sum,
the Ukrainian army enables a favorable situation in the region.
Domestically, democracy continues its gradual development under this
army's protection. Internationally, [Russia has been contained and would
be weakened in a further war, and Western Europe may attend to its own
affairs]{.underline}. The Ukrainian civilian population and
under-equipped army conveniently guard Europe's eastern wall. But [such
an effort cannot be sustained indefinitely by a poor country with a
population less than one-third that of Russia's. Thus
Western]{.underline} military and economic [aid is
necessary.]{.underline} In the meantime, there have been no serious
crises in Europe recently because the Ukrainian army has matters in
hand. Militarily, politically, and economically, [this army is good for
all of Europe]{.underline}.

[The free and fair election in Ukraine]{.underline} of new
President-elect Volodymyr Zelensky [reflects a positive step for
Ukraine's democratic future, but the same challenges from Russia
remain]{.underline}. [There is still the looming cloud of Ukraine's
active military conflict with]{.underline} Vladimir Putin's
[Russia]{.underline}, [as well as ongoing efforts by the Kremlin to sow
discord and chaos through sophisticated disinformation and propaganda
campaigns]{.underline} against the Ukrainian government and society. If
we want to deal a blow to Russia, then [helping challenge Putin on his
doorstep sends a strong signal that America will stand by its allies
wherever they are. Moscow continually ignores international law and the
Minsk Accords by actively supporting the rebels in Eastern
Ukraine]{.underline} and [maintains its illegal control of Crimea while
also blockading Ukrainian ports from vital commerce]{.underline}. More
importantly, [Russia's November 2018 attack]{.underline} on the
Ukrainian Navy in the Sea of Azov [occurred]{.underline} in neutral
waters and [in clear violation of freedom of navigation]{.underline}.
[While the imposition of sanctions on]{.underline} the [Russian
officials]{.underline} responsible for these acts by the administration
on March 15 [are having an impact, **the biggest blow to Russia is the
continuation of a free, independent, and democratic
Ukraine.**]{.underline} I've traveled to Ukraine and been on the front
lines of Putin's hybrid war where Russia tests its new cyber weapons and
tactics. One of the most devastating examples, [Russia's "NotPetya"
virus, originated in Ukraine, spread across sixty-four
countries]{.underline}. It [caused more than \$10 billion worth of
damage]{.underline} to U.S. government agencies and companies like
Maersk, [and]{.underline} it also [fully shut down the Port of Los
Angeles]{.underline}. In advance of Ukraine's parliamentary elections in
October and the start of President-elect Zelensky's term, I will
continue to closely watch Russia's propaganda and cyber assaults because
I fear Russia will use them to interfere in our 2020 elections. One of
President-elect Zelensky's key challenges will be implementing critical
economic and political reforms in a country still reeling from its
corrupt past. Currently, the ten wealthiest individuals in the country
account for 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product. We must
work with Ukraine to develop policies to eliminate monopolies and give
consumers fairer markets. While the government has been slow to
implement key anti-corruption reforms, we need to continue to support
entities like the High Anti-Corruption Court of Ukraine. The words and
deeds of the Trump administration and Congress continue to show
America's unwavering support for Ukraine. America stands unified in
backing Ukraine's sovereignty when we take actions like Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo's July 2018 Crimea declaration and the bipartisan
House passage of the Crimea Annexation Non-Recognition Act in March.
There are more actions we can take. Specifically, [we should develop an
effective Black Sea strategy where the United States, NATO, and other
U.S. allies can regularly deploy naval assets there to better support
Ukraine against Russia]{.underline}. **[We should also increase foreign
military sales and security assistance to Ukraine]{.underline}**. [Last
year's delivery of the Javelin]{.underline} anti-tank [missiles was a
game-changer for the country's ability to better defend itself against
Russian proxies in Eastern Ukraine.]{.underline} Our hardworking Special
Representative for Ukraine Negotiations, Ambassador Kurt Volker,
recently said, "[We also need to look at things like air defense and
coastal defense]{.underline} . . . [It's]{.underline} whatever is
[reasonable and necessary for Ukraine to have a modern capability to
defend itself and prevent further aggression against its
territory]{.underline}." The Sea of Azov attack exhibited the urgency
for Ukraine to have the necessary capabilities to defend itself. That is
why I sent a letter to National Security Advisor John Bolton, along with
my colleagues Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and Greg
Pence (R-IN), to offer congressional assistance on providing additional
offensive and defensive military equipment to Ukraine for a more
effective deterrence. From his actions in Ukraine and across Europe and
the world, it is clear that Vladimir [Putin wants to reclaim the super
power status of the crumbled Soviet Union. Let us continue to stand with
Ukraine and our allies so that does not ever happen.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine is at a stalemate now -- no war

**Pond 2017**

19 Nov 2017 Elizabeth Pond "War in Ukraine: Is This the Way It Ends?
Survival" Global Politics and Strategy Volume 59, 2017 - Issue 6
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2017.1399732

This thumbnail sketch by no means suggests that Putin is giving up on
getting the West (and the Ukrainians) to admit that Ukraine belongs to
Moscow's exclusive sphere of interest. He still seems to expect that
over time Ukrainian corruption and political infighting, President
Donald Trump's unforced error in fracturing the Western alliance, and
'Ukraine fatigue' as leaders change in Western capitals will eventually
let Moscow reassert its dominant political and economic influence over a
nominally independent Ukraine. What this review does suggest, however,
is that [Putin]{.underline} [may have gained some inkling of the high
costs to be paid if he escalates to any further land grab in
Ukraine]{.underline} now, [and is therefore playing a long
gam]{.underline}e of outlasting the West.

'[Putin got just the opposite of what he wanted']{.underline}, contends
Maidan veteran Ryabchuk. [He]{.underline} not only
**[united]{.underline}** the [**Ukrainian elites and grass roots**
against Russia and for Ukraine's membership in the EU]{.underline}:
'[Because]{.underline} [of his annexation of Crimea he got NATO right on
his borders' in tripwire Alliance manoeuvres]{.underline} [in the Baltic
states]{.underline} that paralleled Russia's giant Zapad exercises in
September. [Then 'he tried to help Trump]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[because of the backlash he now has **zero chance to provoke
something'**]{.underline} [in Ukraine]{.underline}.26

Indeed, the record leaves Putin with little to show for his almost four
years of spoiler activism in Ukraine as he starts what should be his
victory lap on the way to re-election as Russia's president next March.
He will certainly win the vote, but his 'managed democracy' and still
high -- but passive -- public approval will confer little popular
legitimacy on him.27 His original social contract that gave Russians
stability and a higher standard of living after President Boris
Yeltsin's chaos did not survive the financial crisis of 2008, the fall
in oil prices in 2014 and the Western sanctions after Putin's annexation
of Crimea that continue to block the Western investment and industrial
modernisation that Russia urgently needs. Unlike the Chinese Communists,
he has failed to give his countrymen the breakthrough to middle-class
wealth. [His war in the Donbas left Moscow with little but expensive
debris when his bid failed to make Kiev pay for rebuilding its
infrastructure while still leaving it under Russian
control]{.underline}.

[Putin's swing to ultranationalist appeals]{.underline} initially
[pushed]{.underline} his [approval ratings up]{.underline}, but [after a
few years the novelty wore off]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [today
they no longer serve to mobilise public opinion]{.underline} [for
further crusades and no longer act as a screen to hide the deteriorating
health]{.underline}, [education]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [access
to consumer goods]{.underline} in Russia's villages and small towns.28

Regional centrifugal nudges on issues ranging from fees for long-haul
truckers, to resistance by minorities to Putin's downgrading of their
ethnic languages, to radicalisation in the Caucasus by battle-hardened
jihadi returnees from Syria and Iraq, all point to a nascent regionalism
and indifference to what the Moscow vertical wants.29 So too does the
success of the muchharassed Alexei Navalny, the would-be opposition
presidential candidate, in reaching beyond his Moscow and St Petersburg
audience by building a network of chapters around the country to spread
his anti-corruption and anti-Putin gospel.30

By contrast, [Ukraine could be said to be emerging]{.underline} [from
its armed conflict with Russia rather well]{.underline} -- depending, of
course, on which Ukrainians you ask. [The population as a whole
wins,]{.underline} [especially because of]{.underline} the [visa free
travel to EU countries]{.underline} that just went into effect. But [the
big winners are the oligarchs]{.underline}. [Thanks to]{.underline} the
[Euromaidan protests]{.underline}, [they got rid of
president]{.underline} Victor [Yanukovych]{.underline}, [whose
sin]{.underline} [in their eyes was]{.underline} not that he followed
Kremlin orders, but [that he blatantly overreached]{.underline} [his
fair personal share in embezzlement]{.underline} by salting away an
estimated \$12bn for his family rather than divvying up the cornucopia
with other millionaires.31 He fled to a villa outside Moscow after his
Berkut special police gunned down peaceful prodemocracy demonstrators on
the Maidan plaza in February 2014 and his own clientelist political
party deserted him.

In his wake, European diplomats on the ground in Ukraine report, [the
'frenemy' oligarchs seem by now to have settled on a more equitable
sharing of remuneration]{.underline} since the last public feud between
President Petro Poroshenko and now ex-Dnipropetrovsk governor
Kolomoyskiy played out in 2015--16 -- and to have also quietly resumed
old connections with Russian counterparts.32 Donbas strongman Rinat
Akhmetov, who before the Revolution of Dignity was regarded as the
tycoon with the closest links to Moscow, lost three-quarters of his
wealth in war damage in his fief, but is still the country's richest man
at \$3.4bn, according to Forbes. And millionaire Poroshenko has served
the oligarchs' reconsolidation well in stonewalling both Western
international donors and young Euromaidan reformers by keeping
Yanukovych-era judges and prosecutors in office, thus deflecting any big
anti-corruption court trials.33

To the Euromaidan watchdogs who have remained active even after the
purge or resignation of reformist technocrats from cabinet posts in
April 2016, of course, the scene looks far less rosy. They did have some
genuine achievements. [The lucrative oil and gas sector has been made
less vulnerable to plunder.]{.underline} [The whole economic system is
vastly more transparent]{.underline} than before the two Maidan
revolutions. [Legislation has been passed requiring]{.underline} [open
bidding]{.underline} for government contracts [and declarations of
personal wealth by senior officials]{.underline}. But laws can be
evaded. And the activists are frustrated by the failure to bring
Yanukovych or any big embezzler from his era to trial -- or to convict
and jail even one of the Berkut Maidan sharpshooters. The natural
alliance between corruption detectives from Ukraine's extraordinary
civil society and Western donors who might bring financial
conditionality to bear on the government has failed to change Ukraine's
culture of graft or break the cosy intermingling of business and
politics.34

There was a point during the Orange Revolution when the kleptocrats
became sufficiently scared about their own futures to start drawing up a
collective pact, according to a person familiar with the discussions, to
pay lump sums as retrospective taxes, go legitimate and get out of
politics in return for not being prosecuted for bygone corruption. That
deal fell through at the last minute, however, and [today's oligarchs no
longer seek salvation by imitating in their own way the
nineteenth-century philanthropy of America's robber barons]{.underline}.
Their mood is so upbeat, in fact, that some outside observers even worry
that the volunteer militias the oligarchs spawned might now turn from
saving Ukraine to threatening it, by reverting to their origins as
warlord enforcers.35

The confluence of Ukrainian tycoons' restored hubris and Vladimir
Putin's concerns about mounting losses hardly portends some grand offer
to pull Russia's generals, troops and heavy weapons out of the Donbas in
return for Western lifting of sanctions and provision of
artificial-intelligence and shale-gas technology to legitimise the
latest instalment of the Putin presidency.36 It does hint, however, that
a mutual interest could be developing in a more modest crisis management
that could restart diplomatic movement, lower civilian casualties in the
Donbas and perhaps, in the best case, suggests former Swedish prime
minister Carl Bildt, even turn Putin's concept of 'limited peacekeeping
operations' along a frozen battle line into a larger UN operation
'covering the entire area' that could someday prepare for UN-sponsored
free and fair elections there.37

A transition to stability might start, in the blunt words of one
European diplomat, by pointing out to Putin his own interest in stopping
the flow of increasingly lethal weapons from Donbas criminal bosses to
accomplices in Chechnya and elsewhere in Russia. The better way would be
for Putin to install moderate separatist leaders in the Donbas and purge
'these criminals who tyrannize the population and thrive off war. Putin
cannot forever just foment destruction if he wants to remain a player in
the region.'38

'My conclusion is that Europe, Canada and the United States now have the
opportunity to foster a political solution to this war', commented
former NATO secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen in an op-ed after
visiting the Donbas in October. 'Nobody is naive about Mr. Putin's
intentions, but a commitment of effort now could uncover a path to end
Europe's deadliest conflict.'39

We face a critical juncture in Ukraine. There is no real ceasefire;
indeed, there was a significant increase in fighting along the line of
contact in eastern Ukraine in mid-January, with Russian/separatist
forces launching attacks on the Donetsk airport and other areas. Instead
of a political settlement, [Moscow currently seeks to create a frozen
conflict in eastern Ukraine as a means to pressure and **destabilize the
Ukrainian government.**]{.underline} [Russians continue to be present in
the Donetsk and Luhansk]{.underline} [oblasts]{.underline} in
substantial numbers [and have introduced significant]{.underline}
amounts of [heavy weapons]{.underline}. Th[is could be preparation for
**another** major **Russian**/ separatist **offensive**]{.underline}.

[Russian success would fatally undermine Ukraine's stability and
embolden the Kremlin to further challenge the security order in Europe.
It might tempt]{.underline} President [Putin]{.underline} [to use his
doctrine of protecting]{.underline} [ethnic Russians and Russian
speakers in **seeking territorial changes elsewhere** in the
neighborhood]{.underline}, **[including in the Baltic
States]{.underline}**, [provoking a **direct challenge to
NATO**]{.underline}. Maintaining Western sanctions are critical but not
by themselves sufficient. [The West needs to bolster deterrence in
Ukraine by **raising the risks and costs** to Russia of any renewed
major offensive]{.underline}.

[That requires]{.underline} providing **[direct military
assistance]{.underline}**---in far larger amounts than provided to date
and including lethal defensive arms---so that Ukraine is better able to
defend itself. The U.S. government should provide Ukraine \$1 billion in
military assistance as soon as possible in 2015, followed by additional
tranches of \$1 billion in FY 2016 and FY 2017.

Additional non-lethal assistance should include: counterbattery radars,
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), electronic counter-measures for use
against opposing UAVs, secure communications capabilities, armored
Humvees and medical support equipment.

[Lethal defensive military assistance should include light anti-armor
missiles]{.underline}, given the large numbers of armored vehicles that
the Russians have deployed in Donetsk and Luhansk and the abysmal
condition of the Ukrainian military's light anti-armor weapons.

Other NATO members should provide military assistance as well. Of
particular use to the Ukrainian military would be equipment and weapons
from NATO members who operate former Soviet equipment compatible with
the arms currently in the Ukrainian inventory.

[Assisting Ukraine to deter attack and defend itself is not inconsistent
with the search for a peaceful, political solution]{.underline}---**[it
is essential to achieving it]{.underline}**. [Only if]{.underline} the
[Kremlin]{.underline} [knows]{.underline} that [the **risks and costs of
further military action** are high will it seek to find an acceptable
political solution]{.underline}. Russia's actions in and against Ukraine
pose the gravest threat to European security in more than 30 years. The
West has the capacity to stop Russia. The question is whether it has the
will.

assistance, another step in slowly boosting that nation's capabilities

[Assessing Russian strategy]{.underline}, however, [is not
straightforward.]{.underline} [One challenge is]{.underline} **[the
total lack of candour]{.underline}** [with which Russia discusses its
intervention]{.underline} [in Ukraine]{.underline}.14 [By constantly
denying its role]{.underline}, [Russia has]{.underline} [introduced a
huge complication into the conduct of the war]{.underline}, [the
associated diplomacy and attempts at analysis]{.underline}.15 This has
been presented as a deliberate and (according to some) clever strategy,
referred to as 'hybrid warfare'.16 Perhaps Russia believes that foreign
minds can be turned by propaganda, or at least left uncertain as to
where the truth lies. Yet if the intention was to spread an invisibility
cloak over military preparations and operations, this effort has
failed.17 [The Kremlin's fiction]{.underline} [might have initially
facilitated]{.underline} the Russian [intervention]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} it has also become a restriction. [Its wider
consequences]{.underline} [**include a growing distrust** of all Russian
government pronouncements]{.underline}, at least outside Russia. The
natural corollary has been increased authoritarianism inside Russia, and
a clampdown on domestic news outlets and independent organisations that
might challenge the official line.18

[Russia's duplicity]{.underline} about what it is up to in Ukraine
[means]{.underline} that [the nature and purpose of Russian military
strategy]{.underline} [must be inferred from actual
activity]{.underline}. [Initially, Russian strategy was politically
defensive and militarily offensive]{.underline}. [Faced with
a]{.underline}n abrupt [loss]{.underline} [of influence in
Kiev]{.underline} [and the prospect of Ukraine turning]{.underline} to
the [West]{.underline}, [it used local militants]{.underline} [and
Russian special forces to push Ukrainian authorities out of
Crimea]{.underline}, and out of key towns and cities in eastern Ukraine.
One interpretation of this effort is that [Moscow hoped to foster a
broad-based anti-Kiev movement. At a minimum, this could put
irresistible pressure]{.underline} on the post-Maidan Ukrainian
government [to back away from its pro-Western course]{.underline}; at a
maximum, it could help reconstruct the old territory of Novorossiya,
which might then attach itself in some way to Russia. Whatever the
original aspiration, [by the spring of 2014]{.underline} [Russian
efforts were concentrated]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the provinces of
[Donetsk]{.underline} [and Luhansk]{.underline}. [At first]{.underline},
[considerable]{.underline} [territory was taken]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} over the summer [significant amounts were
lost]{.underline} to what Kiev called an 'anti-terrorist operation'.
[That prompted]{.underline} a [more overt]{.underline}
[Russian]{.underline} [intervention]{.underline} using regular forces,
which pushed back until the separatist enclave had more defensible
borders. A ceasefire was agreed in the first Minsk agreement in
September 2014.19

On a warm late-May afternoon, I took a taxi to the outskirts of the
Russian capital to the Moscow State Institute of International
Relations, known by its Russian acronym, Mgimo. Flags marked the
entrance to the campus, a stately Soviet behemoth with a
hammer-and-sickle on a panel above the doors. Students in skinny jeans,
button-down shirts and thick black glasses gathered in gaggles by the
flagpoles, checking their phones and chatting. I signed in as a visitor
at the security desk and wandered past a buzzing cafeteria, into the
institute's gift shop, with its rainbow of sweatshirts, coffee mugs and
notebooks emblazoned with the Mgimo logo. Since 1944, Mgimo has trained
legions of diplomats; its 53 language offerings --- including Afrikaans,
Amharic and Vietnamese --- serve as a reminder of the Soviet Union's
global ambitions. As much as ninety-five percent of Russia's foreign
ministry is made up of Mgimo alumni, while those who graduate with
honors and pass a language test become attachés, complete with a green
diplomatic passport. They are then sent forth, as Vladimir Putin himself
put it, "to protect Russian interests" in the rest of the world. Alumni
include the president of Azerbaijan, the foreign-affairs ministers of
Slovakia and Mongolia and Russia's own foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov,
who regularly returns to give the commencement address. Mgimo is run by
the foreign ministry, so Andrey Baykov, its vice rector, is a hybrid ---
part academic, part representative of Russian diplomacy. I asked him a
question that I would spend a long time trying to understand: [[What
does Russia really want?]{.underline}]{.mark} From behind a large dark
wooden desk, Baykov --- young and fresh-faced, dressed smartly in a suit
and slender tie --- answered in nearly flawless British-accented
English: "[To be an autonomous player, [to uphold]{.mark} its identity
of **[a great power which is strategically
independent."]{.mark}**]{.underline} Russia, he explained, did not want
to dismantle the trans-Atlantic world order by splintering NATO and
demolishing the European Union, as was frequently suggested by the
Western press using headlines like "Is Putin's Master Plan Only
Beginning?" (Vanity Fair); "The Dark Arts of Foreign Influence-Peddling"
(The Atlantic); "Why Russia Is Using the Internet to Undermine Western
Democracy" (Slate). Instead, he spoke about the importance of Russia's
national identity and its territorial sovereignty. "Nationalism comes in
different disguises," he told me. "America's nationalism comes in the
disguise of universalism, but this universalism is basically the
American national model being expanded." Russia's nationalism, he went
on, is inward-looking. Students "all come here with the idea that Russia
is a great power. It has all the rights it deserves, but it's being
mistreated," he said. "There is a huge sense of being betrayed."

Baykov's sentiment was one I heard repeatedly while speaking to
analysts, academics and journalists in Moscow. My trip came before the
release of the Mueller report, and Russians alternately laughed or
dismissed as hysterical what they saw as the Western press's assertions
of Putin's grandiose manipulations. "The American media made the Kremlin
the third player in the U.S. election, which is great," joked Andrei
Soldatov, a Russian investigative journalist who specializes in
cybersecurity. "Like, you think to yourself: 'We are such a great
country, we can interfere with world elections!' " His real point was
serious, though: that Americans looking for a master plan fundamentally
misunderstood the [[Russian leadership's mentality]{.underline}]{.mark}.
"When you are trained by the K.G.B., it means [you see the world in
terms of threats]{.underline}," he explained. "That's the only way you
see it. The thing about threats is that when you see threats, [you [do
not have strategy;]{.mark} you rely on tactics. Because you [don't know
what the next threat might be, you only
respond]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark} On another afternoon in Moscow,
I entered the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute for U.S. and
Canadian Studies, a crumbling yellow building, and climbed a stairwell
under a massive chandelier to reach the office of its current director,
Valery Garbuzov. The institute was founded in 1967 after the Cuban
missile crisis, perhaps the nadir of U.S.-Russian relations. Garbuzov
told me that the institute was formed to provide the Soviet regime with
detailed analysis of its adversaries to help direct the U.S.S.R.'s
responses. "That doesn't mean that the Soviet leaders did what was
advised!" he told me mirthfully. "Rather, they did the opposite."
Garbuzov suggested that little had changed --- the Kremlin did not
understand America and did not listen to those who did. The United
States was no different. "We have an image of America as the country
that foments revolutions around the world. The Americans have the image
of Russia as a country that wants to revive the Soviet Union by any
means," he went on. "Both parties deeply misunderstand the motives of
each other's behavior." He concluded by saying: "This is a very sad
thing, the mutual misunderstanding we couldn't overcome during the
decades of the Cold War and can't overcome now." When I met Ruslan
Pukhov, director of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and
Technologies, a military think tank, at the elegant Cafe Pushkin, he did
not mince words. "Every time some Western observer says 'Russians did
this, Russia did that,' I say: 'You describe Russians like they are
Germans and Americans. We are not.' I also ask: 'Do you know the word
bardak?' " I did. "If you don't know the word bardak, you are an idiot
and not an analyst of Russia. Because bardak is disorder, it's fiasco."
Pukhov's point about bardak --- which technically means "mess" but is
also used colloquially to describe utter chaos --- was that Russia's
political system isn't a streamlined, top-down dictatorship. Only
naïveté, paranoia or both could convince you that the system functioned
efficiently enough to execute a grand global anything. Russia has long
been a canvas on which Americans project their thoughts or fears --- of
the Red menace, and of Putin's quest for world domination. This
tradition only accelerated after the 2016 election, when it seemed as if
everyone were an expert on Putin's agenda. There wasn't an election he
didn't hack, a border he wouldn't violate or an American ally he
couldn't manipulate. The very word "Putin" has come to symbolize a
coherent, systematic destruction of the post-Cold War international
order. But no one I spoke with who had an intimate knowledge of Russia
saw that as anything but fiction. Instead, they talked about [[Russia's
strides back onto the world stage as improvised reactions, tactics,
gambles that were at times more worrisome than
masterful.]{.underline}]{.mark} Because a nation's foreign policy is in
part built on its perceptions of itself, magnified to the world stage, I
came to Moscow to understand how Russians saw themselves as much as how
they saw the world. On and off for over two years, I visited other
countries in the Middle East and Europe --- historical allies of the
United States that were portrayed in the press as pivoting to Russia ---
to do the same. If Americans tried to see the world as the Russians did,
and as our allies did, could we better understand what any of these
countries were doing? And if we understood what they really wanted,
could we better understand the world ourselves? To comprehend
contemporary Russian thinking about the West, I was told to start at the
beginning. Yet even identifying the beginning of the post-Cold War
international order is a fraught exercise. Russian policymakers often
set the start date in 1989, when General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev
willingly dismantled Russia's political and military dominance over
Eastern Europe. After such a magnanimous gesture, Moscow believed it
would be treated as an equal partner of the United States, rather than
as a rival, with the right to retain influence over countries in what it
considered its neighborhood. Western observers, on the other hand, date
the dawn of the American hegemonic age as 1991, when the Soviet Union
was roundly defeated and collapsed, costing Russia any say over its
neighboring countries. That is, each side would come to blame the other
for reneging on a post-Cold War compact that the other side never agreed
on or perhaps even really understood. As the Russian academics Andrej
Krickovic and Yuval Weber noted in a 2016 article in the journal Russia
in Global Affairs: "The basic disagreement becomes clear: Was the status
quo set in 1989, making the U.S. a revisionist hegemon, or was it set in
1991, making Russia a revisionist challenger?" The 1999 war in Kosovo
provided the first clear indication that the Russian view would not be
reciprocated. Under President Boris Yeltsin, Russia had joined the
Council of Europe in 1996 and the G7 in 1998. It sought special status
with NATO and even flirted with joining the European Union. The Russians
were furious when NATO forces launched a military campaign in Kosovo
without United Nations Security Council authorization. The Kremlin
viewed Yugoslavia as within its sphere of influence. Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov was over the Atlantic, en route to Washington, when
Vice President Al Gore called to inform him that airstrikes had
commenced. In a show of anger, Primakov turned his plane around.

While no one will admit it, [NATO's mission is now clear: deter a much
weaker but still troublesome Moscow.]{.underline} Thanks to a rogue
Russia's foolish meddling in Ukraine culminating in the invasion and
[capture of
Crimea](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2016-04-18/why-putin-took-crimea),
[[NATO]{.mark} is back as a key international intuition that [ensures
Moscow does not cause trouble in]{.mark} any [alliance

[those]{.mark} pesky ["[little green
men](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/watch-out-for-little-green-men/)]{.mark}"
Russia loves to use]{.underline}. But why is America still shouldering
the burden of the alliance's spending and capabilities? [Simple math
tells you that the [economic muscle of]{.mark} just [Germany, Great
Britain and France]{.mark} --- worth a collective \$8.4 trillion, enough
to field a world-class military easily --- [should be]{.mark} more than
[enough]{.mark} to [push back against any challenge]{.mark} that Russian
President Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} and his band of thugs [could ever
dream up]{.mark}.]{.underline} [We also should consider for a moment the
internal challenges Russia must contend with --- and they aren't
pretty[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Moscow's demographics are a
disaster]{.mark}; her economy is in tatters, thanks to economic
sanctions and gross mismanagement. And [the military]{.mark}, while
certainly [one of the best on the
planet](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/the-rise-russias-military-26339),
[is nowhere near the level of]{.mark} superpower status that it was
during [the Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quite simply, thanks to a
vibrant Europe and a weakened Russia, our friends in Brussels should
have no problem meeting their common defense needs --- with minimal help
from Washington, who will surely remain in NATO but no longer should
need to be NATO. Instead, quite the opposite has happened. The German
Air Force, for example, [[is on the verge of
collapse]{.underline}](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/germanys-air-force-dying-slow-death-25157).
The mighty Royal Navy, the queen's savior during not one, but two world
wars, [[is a shell of what it used to
be]{.underline}](https://warontherocks.com/2017/10/the-royal-navy-has-a-problem/).
[[Readiness and operational capacity are down.]{.mark} In fact, in
various simulations I have led over the years, NATO lost in several
hypnotical conflicts to Russia because alliance forces were so dependent
on America]{.underline} coming to their aid from across the Atlantic
that Moscow took advantage in conflicts over the Baltics to Ukraine and
beyond. Sheer incompetence by NATO, thanks to a lack of resources in
these simulations, was Russia's greatest military advantage. This is the
problem [President Trump](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump) must
address when he speaks to European officials at the NATO summit, because
the administration must turn its attention elsewhere. America has a
strategic need to ensure Europe can and must guarantee its own security
--- because Asia is calling. With a rising China that seems destined to
further challenge the international order in East Asia and beyond,
Washington must be able to deploy as much of its economic, military and
diplomatic prowess into Asia. In the months and years to come, the China
challenge will be America's greatest geopolitical test in decades. [As I
have noted in these pages
recently](http://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/392566-us-china-trade-war-is-just-the-beginning-of-the-struggle-for-global),
the glue that held the U.S.-China relationship --- a shared fear of the
Soviet Union, and then trade --- has disintegrated. Washington and
Beijing seemed destined for a test of wills that will determine not only
the future course of Asia and the larger Indo-Pacific region, but
perhaps the destiny of Taiwan; who will control the South China Sea; and
the fate of the idea that the global commons --- our oceans and seas ---
should remain open to all. Now is the time for the strategic shift
Washington should have made years ago. All NATO members must begin to
spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense. That alone should ensure that
any Russian notions of rekindling its aggressive past die a quick death.
That also should allow America to truly pivot to Asia and ensure China's
own aggressive desires also are checked. None of that means Washington
would step away or leave NATO, pull out all its forces, or move towards
isolationism. Such actions as outlined above are simply a bowing to
strategic reality. [[NATO]{.mark}, being [led by Europe]{.mark}, [can
handle Russia]{.mark} if properly resourced --- and America must handle
China. Anything less only compromises both goals.]{.underline}

#### No IL, Russia won't risk moving on Ukraine no matter what

**Finnegan**, Mar 1, 20**18**, Conor Finnegan is an author for abcnewsgo
and has produced multiple peer-reviewed articles on foreign policy. "US
announces sale of anti-tank missiles to Ukraine over Russian opposition"
<https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-announces-sale-anti-tank-missiles-ukraine-russian/story?id=53450406/BZ>

\"The Javelin system will help Ukraine build its long-term defense
capacity to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity in order to
meet its national defense requirements,\" [the
Pentagon](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/the-pentagon.htm)\'s
Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement Thursday. U.S.
personnel will travel to Ukraine to train their military on its use, the
agency added. Russia has not yet commented on the official notification,
but Sergei Ryabkov, [[Russia]{.mark}\'s deputy foreign minister,
[responded]{.mark} harshly in December [when news of the sale first
broke]{.mark}. \"[The]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates in a
certain sense [crossed the line]{.mark}, announcing the intention to
transfer weapons of direct damaging action to Ukraine,]{.underline}\"
the statement said, translated from Russian. \"[[American weapons can
lead to new victims]{.mark} in our neighboring country, to [which we
cannot remain indifferen]{.mark}]{.underline}[t.]{.mark}\" Kremlin
spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said then that the sale \"will once again
motivate the hotheads\" in [the Ukrainian government and \"unleash
bloodshed again.\" But [since then, there has not been]{.mark} a major
[escalation in the conflict]{.mark}, despite concerns about Russian
retaliation. That could be in part because, \"the prospect for
[increasing]{.mark} the [conflict is]{.mark} just [too costly for Russia
even if you are talking about asymmetric warfare]{.mark},\" according to

### AT -- Russia Defensive

#### Encirclement didn't cause annexation\-\--this is ahistorical and an excuse for brutal Russian aggression 

**Kirchik 14** -- Fellow at Foreign Policy Initiative

(James, "NATO Expansion Didn't Set Off the Ukraine Crisis" Foreign
Policy,
<http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/04/08/nato_expansion_didnt_set_off_the_ukrainian_crisis>)

NATO [**[Expansion Didn\'t Set Off the Ukrainian Crisis]{.mark}**
[Russia hasn\'t been \"encircled]{.mark}\" by the West]{.underline} \--
Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} simply [wants to be able to invade]{.mark} his
neighbors [at will]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Russia\'s invasion]{.mark}
and annexation [of]{.mark} [Crimea]{.mark} has [produced]{.mark} a great
[deal of handwringing in the West]{.mark}, with much of the ire
[directed at NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization\'s slow, 15-year process of expansion into the former
Warsaw Pact nations, critics allege, sparked a tragic, three-stage
process: It humiliated Russia, led to the country\'s encirclement, and
provoked its aggressive behavior toward neighbors. NATO, they say, is a
relic of the Cold War, serving no purpose other than to antagonize
America\'s potential partners in the Kremlin. [[Blaming]{.underline}
[NATO\'s]{.underline} [enlargement for Russian
belligerence]{.underline}]{.mark} [[has been a feature of European
security debates]{.underline}]{.mark} since the end of the Cold War,
[[and a reliable excuse]{.mark} for explaining away every disagreement
between Moscow and the West]{.underline}. \"Wasn\'t consolidating a
democratic Russia more important than bringing the Czech Navy into
NATO?\" New York Times columnist Tom Friedman scoffed after Russia
invaded Georgia in 2008, in a column aptly entitled, \"What did we
expect?\" Returning to this complaint after last month\'s invasion of
Ukraine, Friedman declared that NATO expansion \"remains one of the
dumbest things we\'ve ever done and, of course, laid the groundwork for
Putin\'s rise.\" Fellow New York Times columnist Ross Douthat derided
NATO expansion as a \"neoconservative\" project (pursued, oddly enough,
by Bill Clinton) \"to effectively encircle\" Russia. And no less a
figure than the late George F. Kennan concluded that \"expanding NATO
would be the most fateful error of American policy in the post cold-war
era.\" [Tempting as it may be]{.underline} to castigate NATO for the
deterioration of relations with Russia, **[[nothing could be further
from the truth]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [It]{.underline} was, and
[remains, the Russian regime\'s ideology, rhetoric, and conduct that
provided the impulse for [NATO]{.mark} [expansion]{.mark}, not the other
way around.]{.underline} Far from representing a historic error, the
[enlargement]{.underline} of NATO into Central and Eastern Europe [[has
been one of the few unmitigated success stories of American foreign
policy]{.mark}, as it consolidated democracy and security on a continent
once scarred by total war]{.underline}. [[Faulting NATO for Russia\'s
bad behavior]{.mark} [betrays]{.mark} a fundamental [misunderstanding of
post-Cold War European politics]{.mark}]{.underline}, [misrepresents the
organization\'s role as a defensive alliance, [and]{.mark} **[confuses
aggressor with victim.]{.mark}**]{.underline} First, [a little history
is in order.]{.underline} Russia\'s [[hostile actions towards neighbors
hardly ended with the collapse of Soviet]{.underline}
[communism]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the contrary, [[Moscow continued to
bully]{.mark} its [former]{.mark} republics and
[satellites]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout the early and mid 1990s,
even [before the first round of NATO enlargement]{.underline} (to the
Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland in 1999). In 1992 and 1993 \--
[after Russia formally recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania \-- Moscow cut off energy supplies to these small, reborn
democracies in an attempt to pressure them into keeping Russian military
forces and intelligence officers on their sovereign
territory.]{.underline} From 1997 to 2000, according to former U.S.
Ambassador to Lithuania Keith C. Smith, [Russia halted oil shipments to
the country no less than nine times after it refused to sell refineries
to a Russian state company]{.underline}. To this day, [the Russian
Foreign Ministry maintains that the Baltic republics \-- which Russia
militarily conquered, occupied, and subjugated for nearly five decades
\-- \"voluntarily joined the Soviet Union]{.underline} in 1940.\" The
[Balts didn\'t become part of NATO until 2004. Given this history, is it
any wonder why these countries]{.underline} \-- [or any other country
victimized by Soviet-imposed tyranny \-- would want to join the
alliance? Is it NATO\'s fault for saying OK?]{.underline} Critics of
NATO expansion like to point out that, in exchange for earning Soviet
acceptance of German unification, the United States and its allies
promised not to expand the Atlantic alliance. [This is a myth, stemming
from a selective Russian interpretation of]{.underline} the
[diplomacy]{.underline} at the tail end of the Cold War. In February of
1990, with hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops still stationed in
East Germany, then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his foreign
minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, traveled to Moscow to meet with former
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. A day earlier, President George H.W.
Bush had sent Kohl a letter suggesting that East German territory be
given a \"special military status\" \-- the specifics of which would be
determined later \-- within NATO, implying that the alliance would
indeed continue to expand. Hoping to earn speedy Soviet authorization
for the removal of their troops and the unification of Germany, however,
Genscher told Gorbachev that, \"NATO will not expand itself to the
East.\" But the Germans were not speaking for Washington, never mind the
NATO alliance. Furthermore, as historian Mary Elise Sarotte has pointed
out, Genscher\'s concession was never made in writing, and nor did
Gorbachev \"criticize Mr. Kohl publicly when he and Mr. Bush later
agreed to offer only a special military status to the former East
Germany instead of a pledge that NATO wouldn\'t expand.\" Ultimately, a
legally binding agreement not to expand NATO beyond its pre-1990 borders
never materialized, and [[Russia\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} latter-day
[[claim that it was deceived by the West]{.mark} [has no basis in
fact]{.mark}. **[Russia\'s cries of Western betrayal]{.mark} are really
[just a smokescreen]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Far from threatening Russia,
[[NATO]{.mark} has repeatedly [gone out of its way to be
conciliatory.]{.mark}]{.underline} A 1997 agreement outlining relations
between the two former adversaries stipulated that the NATO states had
\"no intention, no plan, and no reason\" to deploy nuclear weapons on
the territory of its new members. These \"three no\'s\" were intended as
an expression of goodwill and a reaffirmation of NATO\'s founding
principle: that it is a defensive alliance with no designs on Russian
territory. In the spirit of transparency, the organization founded the
NATO-Russia Council in 2002 to facilitate cooperation between Moscow and
member states. [[Not only did]{.mark} Western [leaders]{.mark}
repeatedly and [explicitly make clear that NATO posed no threat]{.mark}
whatsoever to Russia\'s security, [some]{.mark} even [suggested]{.mark}
that [Russia ultimately join]{.mark} the]{.underline} very military
[alliance]{.underline} that had been established to contain it during
the Cold War. \"We need Russia for the resolution of European and global
problems,\" Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski said in 2009. \"That
is why I think it would be good for Russia to join NATO.\" This hardly
constitutes \"cram\[ming\] NATO expansion down the Russians\' throats,\"
as Friedman alleges. Regardless, Sikorski was rebuked immediately by
then-Russian envoy to NATO and now Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin,
who retorted that \"Great powers don\'t join coalitions, they create
coalitions. Russia considers itself a great power\...For the moment, we
don\'t see any real change in the organization, we only see the
organization getting ready for the wars of past Europe.\" [[With]{.mark}
its [invasion of Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline}, the first forcible
annexation of European territory since World War II, [it is
[Russia]{.mark}, and not NATO, that has [returned the continent to \"the
wars of past Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" [More
significant,]{.underline} however, [was what this terse exchange
revealed about the [debate over NATO expansion]{.mark}: It has
[never]{.mark} really [been]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the [enlargement of a
defensive military alliance]{.mark}, but **r[ather the nature of
the]{.mark} Russian [regime itself]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [If Russia
had]{.underline} followed a democratic path (like the former communist
states which joined NATO) and [ceased posing a threat to its neighbors,
there would have been nothing preventing it from becoming a]{.underline}
suitable [candidate for membership]{.underline}. After all, if the
foreign minister of Poland, a nation historically terrorized by Russia
and which is once again rearming itself in light of Crimea, proposed
that Russia join NATO, who could possibly oppose it? As Swedish Foreign
Minister Carl Bildt aptly pointed out on Twitter recently, it was the
\"historic failure of Russia that a quarter of a century after fall of
Soviet Union the new generations in its neighbors see it as an enemy,\"
while, in contrast, \"A generation or two after 1945 Germany is
surrounded by countries that, after all the horrible pain and suffering,
see it as a friend.\" [[Russia\'s hostility]{.underline}]{.mark} to NATO
enlargement [[stems from]{.mark} the]{.underline} same [[root as all of
its conflicts]{.mark} with the West: **the [zero-sum worldview and
neo-imperialist agenda]{.mark}** of]{.underline} President Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline}. . In 2005, [he declared the breakup of the Soviet
Union to be \"a major geopolitical disaster of the 20th
century]{.underline}.\" And [if there was any remaining doubt that he
intends to reconstitute the empire, Putin erased it with]{.underline}
[his]{.underline} furious March 18 [speech]{.underline} to Russia\'s
Federation Council [in which he essentially reserved the right to invade
and annex any territory where ethnic Russians claim to feel
oppressed]{.underline}. To [say that NATO expansion \"laid the
groundwork for Putin\'s rise,\"]{.underline} as Friedman does, [gets the
situation exactly backwards. Putin\'s ascent was almost entirely the
product of domestic factors]{.underline}, namely, the economic chaos of
the 1990s [and the popular desire for a firm response to the insurgency
in Chechnya]{.underline}. [NATO expansion barely registered on the minds
of ordinary Russians.]{.underline} With Russia amassing tens of
thousands of troops on Ukraine\'s eastern border and stoking ethnic
conflict in the hopes of providing a pretext for gobbling up even more
territory, [[lending credence to Moscow\'s complaints about NATO
expansion is **intellectually irresponsible and geopolitically
dangerous.**]{.underline}]{.mark} In the midst of negotiations to
deescalate the crisis, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei [[Lavrov]{.mark}
has [demanded]{.mark} that [Ukraine essentially dismember itself into
autonomous regions]{.mark}]{.underline} (the easier for Russia to meddle
in the country\'s eastern provinces, which are heavily populated with
ethnic Russians) [and \"firm guarantees]{.underline}\" forswearing NATO
and EU membership. [[Given that]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark} has already
invaded and [annexed Ukrainian territory]{.mark}, and that [it has shown
no sign of discontinuing its aggressive behavior]{.mark} on the
country\'s borders, these [ultimatums constitute nothing]{.mark} [less
than a threat to use additional force]{.mark} if its demands are not
met.]{.underline} Rather than firmly rebut these outrageous attempts to
violate the sovereignty of an independent country, Secretary of State
John Kerry has stated that Russia has \"legitimate concerns\" in
Ukraine. This despite the fact that [according to a new
poll]{.underline}, 66 percent of ethnic [Russian citizens there feel no
pressure or threat from the new government]{.underline} in Kiev, a
[direct refutation of Moscow\'s relentless propaganda to the contrary.
The [assertion by Russia]{.mark} (and its Western apologists) [that NATO
constitutes a threat]{.mark} has always [been a
ruse]{.mark}]{.underline}. As was the case during the Cold War, it [is
[Russia that threatens its neighbors]{.mark} today, [not
vice-versa.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Russia\'s real reason for opposing
NATO]{.mark} expansion,]{.underline} as one Ukrainian Foreign Ministry
official told me in Kiev last month, is [that the al[liance\'s
collective security provision]{.mark} would [prevent Moscow from
invading]{.mark} its neighbors, something that Russia has done twice in
the last six years]{.underline}. It is for this reason that **[[NATO \--
and its expansion \-- remains vital for European security and
stability]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To appreciate the hypocrisy of
faulting NATO enlargement for the present predicament, one need only
consider the claim that the military alliance has \"encircled\" Russia.
[There is only one country in Europe being encircled right now \-- and
it isn\'t Russia.]{.underline}

## Case neg

### Solvency -- Training

#### The US can still *[train]{.underline}* the Azov Battalions even if they cannot sell them weapons

**Cathcart & Epstein 17** (Will Cathcart & Joseph Epstein, 04.14.17. Is
America Training Neonazis in Ukraine?
<https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-america-training-neonazis-in-ukraine>

But the highly problematic truth is that **[the U.S. currently has no
real way of ensuring that members of neo-Nazi groups like the Azov
Battalion are not being trained by U.S. forces]{.underline}**, because
most, if not all, have not committed a "gross human rights violation."
**[Even more difficult to determine is whether ex-U.S. military are
training crypto-Nazis in a private capacity]{.underline}**, and the
issues speaks volumes about the complexities that have to be confronted
by the United States in its efforts to help Ukraine defend itself from
the Russian-supported secessionists. In an interview with The Daily
Beast, **[Sgt]{.underline}**. Ivan **[Kharkiv of the Azov battalion
talks about his battalion's experience with U.S. trainers and U.S.
volunteers quite fondly]{.underline}**, even
**[mentioning]{.underline}** U.S. volunteers **[engineers and medics
that are]{.underline}** still **[currently assisting
them]{.underline}**. He also talks about the significant and active
support from the Ukrainian diaspora in the U.S. As for the training they
have and continue to receive from numerous foreign armed forces. Kharkiv
says "We must take knowledge from all armies... We pay for our mistakes
with our lives."

### UQ - Ban

#### Congress has already banned arms sales to Azov, they aren't really nazis & don't get weapons from the US

**Kheel 18** ([REBECCA KHEEL](https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-kheel),

<https://thehill.com/policy/defense/380483-congress-bans-arms-to-controversial-ukrainian-militia-linked-to-neo-nazis>

This year, though, **[the]{.underline}** \$1.3 trillion
**[omnibus]{.underline}** spending **[bill signed into
law]{.underline}** last week **[stipulates that "none of the funds made
available by this act may be used to provide arms, training or other
assistance to the Azov Battalion."]{.underline}** "White supremacy and
neo-Nazism are unacceptable and have no place in our world," Rep. [Ro
Khanna](https://thehill.com/people/rohit-ro-khanna) (D-Calif.), an
outspoken critic of providing lethal aid to Ukraine, said in a statement
to The Hill on Tuesday. "I am very pleased that the recently passed
omnibus prevents the U.S. from providing arms and training assistance to
the neo-Nazi Azov Battalion fighting in Ukraine." The United States has
been aiding and training Ukrainian forces in their fight against
Russian-backed separatists since 2014, and recently expanded that aid to
include arms. The omnibus includes about \$620.7 million in aid for
Ukraine, including \$420.7 million in State Department and foreign
operations funds and \$200 million in Pentagon funds. The Azov Battalion
was founded in 2014, and its first commander was Andriy Biletsky, who
previously headed the neo-Nazi group Patriot of Ukraine. Several members
of the militia, which has been integrated into the Ukrainian National
Guard, are self-avowed neo-Nazis. **[But]{.underline}** a spokesman for
the group has defended it, telling USA Today in 2015 that **[only 10 to
20 percent of recruits are neo-Nazis and that those people do not
represent the official ideology of Azov]{.underline}**. **[It's unclear
how much, if anything, from the United States has gone to Azov in the
past]{.underline}**. "The State Department should pressure Kiev to
dissociate itself with this group and investigate whether any of our
weapons or training have already been provided to them," Khanna said in
his statement. "This is just one of many reasons why lawmakers should be
concerned about channeling huge amounts of weapons into this volatile
conflict zone." Last year, online posts by the militia's news service
showed members testing U.S.-made grenade launchers at a firing range.
The posts have since been deleted, and the Ukrainian National Guard
insisted in a January statement that the grenade launchers were not in
Azov's possession. U.S. officials have said **[vetting required under
the so-called Leahy Law already prevents the United States from aiding
Azov]{.underline}**. **[The Leahy Law bans U.S. aid from going to groups
when the "secretary of State has credible information that such unit has
committed a gross violation of human rights."]{.underline}**

### UQ -- No Fascism

#### No risk of fascist takeover - far-right groups are disorganized and hold no political power

**Umland 2019** (Andreas Umland, Andreas Umland, Dr.Phil. (FU Berlin),
Ph.D. (Cambridge), has been a Senior Fellow at the Institute for
Euro-Atlantic Cooperation at Kyiv, since 2014. He has held fellow- or

Right Parties Fail Again in 2019?]{.underline}**,
https://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2019/03/27/will-ukraines-far-right-parties-fail-again-in-2019/)

Yet, it became soon apparent that Koshulynskyi's nomination by the
signatory organizations of the far right's 2017 National Manifesto had,
for one reason or another, either not at all or insufficiently been
agreed with Biletskiy's National Corps. **[Svoboda and its
allies]{.underline}**, on the one side, **[and the National
Corps]{.underline}**, on the other, have since **[accused each other of
sabotaging the coordination process]{.underline}** before Koshulynskyi's
nomination. In any way, for the presidential elections, neither the
apparent break of the 2017 coalition nor Dmytro Yarosh's public support
for Koshulynskyi candidacy since are of much political importance. In
fact, **[Koshulynskyi's]{.underline}** possibly **[weak performance in
the upcoming elections could turn into a public relations disaster for
the far right]{.underline}**. In an [opinion poll released by the
reputed Razumkov Center on 20 February
2019](http://razumkov.org.ua/napriamky/sotsiologichni-doslidzhennia/riven-doviry-do-suspilnykh-instytutiv-ta-elektoralni-oriientatsii-gromadian-ukrainy?fbclid=IwAR3JcfhBWiucaUiP-aFFyHXHhbJqY0sUcflR4Ff8zrQws-oXfHXO7-XazKU),
**[Koshulynskyi had the support of only 0.9% of those intending to vote
in presidential elections]{.underline}**. With such a result,
Koshulynskyi would remain even below the already embarrassing result of
1.16% that his party colleague Tyahnybok had obtained during the 2014
presidential elections. It would be stunning, if Koshulynskyi will
indeed receive so little support although he, unlike Tyahnybok who in
2014 competed with Yarosh, does not have a competitor on the far-right
flank. Neither Biletskyi nor Yarosh or any other prominent
ultra-nationalists decided to also run, in the presidential elections.
The by far most important aspect of the **[current tensions between the
National Corps]{.underline}**, on the one side, **[and the other
ultra-nationalist groups]{.underline}**, on the other, **[is thus that
it could mean that they run separately in the parliamentary
elections]{.underline}**, in October 2019. **[Such a division of their
vote could repeat the far right's fiasco of 2014]{.underline}**. In
fact, **[it is not entirely clear that even a fully united far right
list would be able to pass the 5% threshold]{.underline}**. That is
because, in the words of prominent Kyiv political analyst Volodymyr
Fesenko, ["Petro Poroshenko's broad campaign is build on militant
patriotic rhetoric as well as on support for the candidacy of Ukraine's
incumbent President by some influential nationalists \[which\] greatly
diminishes Koshulynskyi's chances, in the presidential elections, and
the chances of Svoboda, not to mention other nationalist parties, in the
parliamentary
elections."](https://blogs.pravda.com.ua/authors/fesenko/5c60887f89ee1/?fbclid=IwAR0Jhso8lxBC3EaUtPnraJZG9HyjsKEn73FgRJkCqryw3Izwej9rH4DVRY4)
In the words of the Vienna political scientist Anton Shekhovtsov too,
the far right has now "low chances to get into the Rada because, above
all, the political system of Ukraine is again extremely polarized (as
was the case in the 1990s and early 2000s). **[The conflict in the
political center is currently so intense that there is, for all
peripheral parties, little hope to join this confrontation within the
center and thereby enter the national debate]{.underline}**. In some
way, the situation of 'Svoboda' and the National Corps is similar to
that of small liberal parties like the Democratic Alliance or 'Power of
the People.' They too have no chance -- and not so much because they do
not unite, but because **[the current system's center is battle field of
much stronger political]{.underline}** players. Moreover, it is
important to remember that 'Svoboda' managed to enter the Rada in 2012
because it was helped by the President Viktor Yanukovych. Today, nobody
needs the right-wing radicals apart from certain business projects that
require their services for raiding attacks or similar practices." The
Ambitious National Corps As of February 2019, the summary support of
those intending to vote in parliamentary elections for Svoboda (1.4%),
the National Corps (0.2%), the Statesman Initiative of Yarosh (0.1%),
and the Right Sector (0.0%) was, in the mentioned Razumkov Center poll,
altogether just 1.7%. To be sure, Ukraine's far right has sometimes
performed much better in real elections than in pre-electoral surveys.
Yet, the **[currently measured support for the far right would have to
triple during the actual voting,]{.underline}** in order for a united
list, **[to pass the 5% threshold]{.underline}**. In spite of the
sobering polling results, Biletskyi seems to be currently still planning
a separate list of his party in the upcoming parliamentary elections. A
representative of the National Corps reportedly asserted, in November
2018, that his organization's "[potential and human resources are much
larger than those of all the other \[signatory organizations of the far
right's 2017 National Manifesto\]
combined."](https://daily.rbc.ua/ukr/show/pravyy-raskol-pochemu-natsionalisty-dogovorilis-1542975245.html)
A competition between the National Corps, on the one hand, and a united
list of the remaining parties, on the other, could become significant,
if Poroshenko is not reelected in April 2019 and a less militantly
patriotic candidate becomes President. In such a case, nationalist
voters currently attracted to the incumbent President could decide to
support the ultra-nationalists in subsequent elections. This could
provide the far right with an opportunity to regain a faction, in the
next parliament. However, if, in such favorable conditions, Biletskyi's
National Corps runs an effective parallel campaign, Svoboda's list --
the currently most likely and most prospective option -- could, in
October 2019, again miss the 5% barrier, as it did in October 2014. Much
of this is, so far, however, speculation. Ukrainian party politics and
national elections are notoriously unpredictable matters. The first two
months of 2019 and meteoric rise of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, within only a
few weeks, have shown how fast and radical, the "correlation of forces,"
as a prime term of Soviet political analysis goes, can change, in
post-Soviet Ukrainian domestic affairs. Moreover, it is likely that
Moscow will, in one way or another, try to leave its imprint on, at
least, the parliamentary elections in October. Such attempts may not
necessarily be successful, in terms of the Kremlin's interest. Yet, they
could change public opinion and the party-political constellation --
perhaps, even to the advantage of the far right. As of late February
2019, notwithstanding, **[it looks as if Ukraine's far right may perform
calamitously]{.underline}** in both, the spring presidential and autumn
parliamentary elections.

#### Ukraine isn't becoming fascist -- policies remain moderate

**Motyl 2015** (Alexander Motyl, Professor of Political Science, Rutgers
University-Newark, 02,03,15, Is Ukraine Fascist?,
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/putin-calls-ukraine-fasci_b_6600292)

Although there are often two sides to a story, in this case, there
really isn't. The Kremlin is dead wrong, and even though
**[Ukraine]{.underline}** isn't quite the consolidated democracy that
its government says it is, the country **[is certainly far more
democratic now than it was just over a year ago. And, despite some
zigzags, it is becoming more democratic with every day]{.underline}**.
Let's start with a brief discussion of what fascism is and then ask
whether any of Ukraine's present or past government fits the bill.
Fascism is often used as an epithet, especially by the left, but it
actually is a perfectly respectable academic term that refers to a
particular type of political system. Everyone can agree that fascist
states are authoritarian --- that is, they lack the fundamental
attributes of democracy. Unlike democracies, fascist systems lack
meaningful parliaments, judiciaries, parties, political contestation and
elections. In fascist systems, as in all authoritarian systems,
parliaments are rubber-stamp institutions, judiciaries do what the
leader tells them, opposition parties are marginal and electoral
outcomes are preordained. Like all authoritarian states, fascist states
are highly centralized and hierarchical, they give pride of place within
the power structure to soldiers and policemen, usually secret policemen,
and they always have a supreme leader. Indeed, there can be no fascist
state without a supreme leader. Like authoritarian states, fascist
states limit freedom of the press, freedom of speech and freedom of
assembly; and espouse some form of ethnocentrism glorifying their nation
and their state and their fabulous past, present and future. But fascist
states are not just run-of-the-mill authoritarian states. The latter
typically connotes images of dour old men ruling a sullen population.
Fascist states exude youth and vigor, and they always implicate the
population in its own repression. Fascist leaders strut. They want to
appear youthful, manly and active: they are machos, par excellence. They
also appeal to those qualities in the population, usually co-opting the
young into their movements or parties. No less important, fascist states
are popular: they incorporate the population into the system of rule,
promising it a grand and glorious future in exchange for its enthusiasm
and support. Not surprisingly, fascist states tend to sound and act
aggressively. The soldiers and policemen that run fascist states have a
natural proclivity to toughness and weaponry. The ethnocentrism appeals
to national and state glory, and cult of vigor sees enemies everywhere.
The machismo-based cult-like status of leaders encourages them to pound
their chests with abandon. And the population's implication in its own
repression leads it to balance its self-humiliation with attempts to
humiliate others. **[Seen in this light, Franco's Spain, Pinochet's
Chile and the Greece of the colonels were really just your average
authoritarian states. So, too, is today's China. In contrast,
Mussolini's Italy was clearly fascist, as was Hitler's Germany and
Atatürk's Turkey.]{.underline}** What of today's Ukraine? I trust the
question answers itself**[. Ukraine has a tri-partite government
structure characterized by an independent presidency and parliament and
a semi-independent (though corrupt) judiciary, a vigorous multi-party
system, fair and free elections --- most recently, of both president and
the parliament --- a free (if sometimes irresponsible) press and
protection of human, civil and minority rights.]{.underline}** Of
special importance is the fact that **[Ukraine's government is run by
civilians only]{.underline}** and that its president --- Petro
Poroshenko --- has none of the strongman features that a fascist supreme
leader promotes via a machismo-based cult of personality. Last but not
least, **[Ukraine has not pursued any of the repressive policies
associated with fascism.]{.underline}** Oppositions, minorities and
marginal groups thrive, civil society is strong, and, if anything,
Ukrainians accuse the government of being too weak --- and certainly not
too strong. Ukraine is far from a consolidated democracy. Its democratic
institutions are young and weak; its **[commitment to democratic
practices]{.underline}** has not yet stood the test of time. **[Police,
judges and politicians are often corrupt, and bad policies are
frequently adopted. These faults make Ukraine a flawed democracy,
possibly a very flawed democracy, but they do not come anywhere near to
making it a fascist state.]{.underline}** Supporters of the
Ukraine-is-fascist argument might say that Ukraine is not fascist, but
its rulers are fascists who want to establish a fascist system of rule.
Alas, this claim is absurd. **[Poroshenko and his predecessor, Acting
President Oleksandr Turchynov, are obviously not
fascists.]{.underline}** None of the current cabinet members has
anything resembling fascist credentials. The government that succeeded
the corrupt Yanukovych dictatorship in late February 2014 consisted of
19 individuals: only two (Defense Minister Ihor Tenyukh and Deputy Prime
Minister Oleksandr Sych) were members of the right-wing Svoboda party
and one, the Secretary of the National and Security Defense Council
Andriy Parubiy, had right-wing ties until 2004. In early 2014, Svoboda
had 38 seats in Ukraine's parliament --- out of a total of 450.
Svoboda's leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, had run for president in the 2010
elections that brought Yanukovych to power and received 1.43 percent of
the vote. He ran again, in the presidential ballot of May 25, 2014, and
received 1.16 percent. Dmytro Yarosh, head of the right-wing Right
Sector, received a mere 0.70 percent in 2014. In the October 26, 2104,
parliamentary elections, Svoboda and the Right Sector got, respectively,
six seats and one seat. Tyahnybok has made some anti-Semitic and
anti-Russian statements in the past but his language and behavior
changed significantly during, and as a result of, the Maidan Revolution
that ousted Yanukovych. He has since attempted to position himself as a
moderate nationalist. Svoboda's approach to ethnic relations has been
termed fascist but in point of fact it is strikingly similar to official
policy in Estonia, Latvia and Israel. In effect, Svoboda aspires to
create a "lite" version of what Israeli scholar Oren Yiftachel calls an
"ethnocracy," a system of rule within which the titular nation holds a
position of dominance over the other nations inhabiting the land, such
as Estonians and Latvians vis-à-vis Russians or Jews vis-à-vis
Palestinians. As the Baltic and Israeli examples show, ethnocracies can
be democratic, but they're obviously not as democratic as liberal
democracies and, with their penchant for hierarchy, can easily violate
the civil rights of minorities. Although Tyahnybok has gone on record
praising Israel for the fact that all its parties are nationalist,
Svoboda does not call for disenfranchising minorities in the manner of
the Balts and Israelis.

#### Ukrainian nationalists aren't Nazis -- their evidence is inflated by Russian propaganda

**Kirchick 14** (James Kirchick is a fellow with the Foreign Policy

**[To hear]{.underline}** Vladimir **[Putin tell it, Right
Sector]{.underline}** -- along with the nationalist political party
Svoboda -- **[was the main force behind the revolution]{.underline}**
last month ousting pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, and is now
the power calling the shots in Ukraine. **[Moscow cited the alleged role
of Ukrainian ultra-nationalism in the revolution, and the new
government's hostility toward ethnic Russians, to justify its annexation
of Crimea]{.underline}**. "Nationalists, neo-Nazis, Russophobes and
anti-Semites executed this coup," Putin stated flatly in his speech to
the Russian Federation Council on March 18. "They continue to set the
tone in Ukraine to this day." **[Various American pundits, on both the
[left](http://www.salon.com/2014/02/25/is_the_us_backing_neo_nazis_in_ukraine_partner/)
and
[right](http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2014/03/04/a-monster-reawakens-the-rise-of-ukrainian-fascism/),
have essentially repeated this line to discourage American support for
Ukraine's new government]{.underline}**. To be sure, Right Sector's
ideology and tactics are not those of liberal democrats. But **[if Right
Sector was truly "set\[ting\] the tone in Ukraine]{.underline}**,"
presumably **[it would not be trying to storm the parliament building
demanding the resignation of a key government minister. If it had
actually "executed" a "coup," it would be in control of the country's
armed forces, rather than refuse to be integrated into
it.]{.underline}** Right Sector, a coalition of nationalist groups that
surprised most close observers of Ukrainian politics with its quick
emergence as a self-defense force during the EuroMaidan protests, has
earned an inordinate amount of press attention over the past several
months. This is partly due to the group's demeanor and physical
presence; burly men dressed in black roaming the streets of Kiev with
baseball bats and knives make for a much sexier story than the
incomprehensible machinations and backroom dealings that otherwise
characterize Ukraine's labyrinthine political space. **[But Right Sector
has also made headlines because of a concerted Russian propaganda
campaign to tar the revolution as the work of violent, radical
nationalists]{.underline}**. What might have started out as a
well-intentioned reaction to Yanukovych's rejecting a trade package with
the European Union, these critics say, was swiftly overtaken by
"fascists" of various stripes. This is far from the truth. To begin
with, and this is meant as no defense of the organization, it is lazy to
label Right Sector "fascist." In an
[interview](http://mag.newsweek.com/2014/03/28/exclusive-dmitry-yarosh-man-who-launched-ukrainian.html)
with Newsweek, the group's leader, Dmitry Yarosh, claimed that **[40
percent of its members are Russian speakers and that "Jews and other
nationals feel comfortable in our forces.]{.underline}**" In early
March, Yarosh met with the Israeli ambassador to Kiev, who later posted
[on
the](http://forward.com/articles/194014/israel-envoy-meets-with-ukraine-anti-semite-dmitry/#ixzz2xNwDO9pq)
embassy's website that "Yarosh stressed that Right Sector will oppose
all \[racist\] phenomena, especially anti-Semitism, with all legitimate
means." The group's anti-Russian ideology does not automatically
translate into a pro-European stance; it opposes homosexuality and
abortion and fears that closer integration with Europe -- the clarion
call of the early Maidan movement -- will weaken Ukraine's independence.
That said, **[there is no evidence that the group is responsible for any
sort of hate crimes against the country's minority
groups]{.underline}**. Artem **[Soropadsky]{.underline}**, the group's
spokesman, **[insists]{.underline}** to me that, "**[we are not fascists
or Nazis but nationalists]{.underline}**." Nationalists they are. But
**[Right Sector tends to emphasize the preservation and propagation of
the Ukrainian language]{.underline}** (Yarosh is himself a former
language teacher), **[rather than the denigration of minority
groups.]{.underline}** In an
[interview](http://seansrussiablog.org/2014/02/07/interview-dmytro-yarosh-leader-right-sector/)
with a Ukrainian newspaper, Yarosh sounded downright sentimental
describing the diversity of people who participated in the movement to
overthrow Yanukovych, and he was at pains to distance himself from
Svoboda's overt xenophobia. "I don't understand certain racist things
they share, I absolutely don't accept them. A Belarusian died for
Ukraine, and an Armenian from Dnipropetrovsk died for Ukraine," he said.

#### The 1ac is Russian propaganda -- they inflate the threat of far-right extremism 

**Snyder 14** ([Timothy
Snyder](https://www.nybooks.com/contributors/timothy-snyder/), Levin

Relations, and a permanent fellow of the Institute for Human Sciences in
Vienna, March 1, 2014. Ukraine: The Haze of Propaganda
<https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2014/03/01/ukraine-haze-propaganda/>

From Moscow to London to New York, **[the Ukrainian revolution has been
seen through a haze of propaganda]{.underline}**. Russian leaders and
**[the Russian press have insisted that Ukrainian protesters were
right-wing extremists]{.underline}** and then that their victory was a
coup. Ukraine's president, Viktor Yanukovych, used the same clichés
after a visit with the Russian president at Sochi. After his regime was
overturned, he maintained he had been ousted by "right-wing thugs," a
claim echoed by the armed men who seized control of airports and
government buildings in the southern Ukrainian district of Crimea on
Friday. Interestingly, **[the message from authoritarian regimes in
Moscow and Kiev was not so different from some of what was written
during the uprising]{.underline}** in the English-speaking world,
**[especially in publications of the far left]{.underline}** and the far
right. From Lyndon LaRouche's Executive Intelligence Review through Ron
Paul's newsletter through The Nation and The Guardian, the story was
essentially the same: **[little of the factual history of the protests,
but instead a play on the idea of a nationalist, fascist, or even Nazi
coup d'état]{.underline}**.

### **[A2 Ukrainian nationalism]{.underline}**

#### Ukrainian nationalism stabilizes the country

**Applebaum 14** (Anne Applebaum, Washington Post columnist,
Pulitzer-Prize winning historian, Professor of Practice, Institute of
Global Affairs, LSE MAY 12TH, 2014 NATIONALISM IS EXACTLY WHAT UKRAINE
NEEDS
<https://www.anneapplebaum.com/2014/05/12/nationalism-is-exactly-what-ukraine-needs/>

The result can be seen right now in eastern **[Ukraine]{.underline}**.
For this---Donetsk, Slavyansk, Kramatorsk---**[is what a land without
nationalism]{.underline}** actually **[looks like: corrupt, anarchic,
full of rent-a-mobs and mercenaries]{.underline}**. For the most part,
the men in balaclavas who have assaulted Ukrainian state institutions
under the leadership of Russian commandos are not nationalists; they are
people who will do the bidding of whichever political force pays best or
promises most. And although they are a small minority, the majority does
not oppose them. On the contrary, the majority is watching the battle
passively and seems prepared to take whichever government they get. Like
my friends in L'viv, these are people who live where they do by
accident, whose parents or grandparents arrived by the whim of a Soviet
bureaucrat, who have no attachment to any nation or any state at all.
Thus **[do the tiny group of nationalists in Ukraine]{.underline}**,
whom perhaps we can now agree to call patriots, **[represent the
country's only hope of escaping]{.underline}** apathy, rapacious
**[corruption]{.underline}**, and, eventually, dismemberment. And this
should be no surprise: In the nineteenth century, no sensible freedom
fighter would have imagined it possible to create a modern state, let
alone a democracy, without some kind of nationalist movement behind it.
Only people who feel some kind of allegiance to their society---people
who celebrate their national language, literature, and history, people
who sing national songs and repeat national legends---are going to work
on that society's behalf. This goes for Russians, too, though tragically
they insist on looking to their imperial traditions as a source of
national pride, instead of to their liberal leaders in the early
twentieth century or to their outstanding Soviet-era dissidents, the
founders of the modern human rights movement. In the West, we know this,
but lately, we rarely admit it. That's in part because we remember very
well the disasters that ethnic nationalism, cloaked as fascism or
sometimes as communism, brought in the twentieth century. Europeans in
particular now go out of their way to downplay national differences,
which is usually good. Territorial disputes in Europe have dissolved,
since open borders make it simply less important whether Alsace is
French or German. But **[European democracy would fail if European
politicians did not also appeal to patriotism]{.underline}**, did not
take national interests into account, and did not address themselves to
the special problems of their particular nations, too. In the United
States, we dislike the word "nationalism" and so, hypocritically, we
call it other things: "American exceptionalism," for example, or a
"belief in American greatness." We also argue about it as if it were
something rational---Mitt Romney wrote a book that put forth the "case
for American greatness"---rather than acknowledging that nationalism is
fundamentally emotional. In truth, you can't really make "the case" for
nationalism; you can only inculcate it, teach it to children, cultivate
it at public events. If you do so, **[nationalism can in turn inspire
you so that you try to improve your country]{.underline}**, to help it
live up to the image you want it to have. Among other things, that
thought inspired the creation of this magazine 100 years ago.
**[Ukrainians need more of this kind of inspiration, not
less]{.underline}**---moments like last New Year's Eve, when more than
100,000 Ukrainians sang the national anthem at midnight on the Maidan.
They need more occasions when they can shout, "Slava Ukraini---Heroyam
Slava"---"Glory to Ukraine, Glory to its Heroes," which was, yes, the
slogan of the controversial Ukrainian Revolutionary Army in the 1940s,
but has been adopted to a new context. And then of course **[they need
to translate that emotion into laws, institutions, a decent court
system, and police training academies. If they don't, then their country
will once again cease to exist.]{.underline}**

in incidents **[of white supremacist propaganda and recruitment
efforts]{.underline}** on college campuses from 2017 to 2018. Looking at
scholarship on political violence and lessons learned from other
countries can be helpful for understanding Trump's responsibility for
what is happening here at home. Extremists of all stripes often make
sense of their personal grievances (perceptions of the ways they have
been wronged) by blaming them on political injustices. They believe
others threaten them and their kind, and often consider the government
as inept at best or complicit at worst. Fear is often a major motivator
for violence, which extremists believe they are committing in defense of
themselves and their kind. **[Trump's rhetoric and action validate

recognizable way in which he contributes to an enabling environment for
the far-right fringe. The magnitude of oratorical malfeasance --- in
numbers and content --- is overwhelming. **[Trump's rhetoric fuels
right-wing recruitment and mobilization by validating their messaging
and emboldening them to promote it in the political
arena]{.underline}**. His public pronouncements have also contributed to
the climate in which terrorist attacks occur. Scholars have identified
five indicators of "[dangerous speech](https://dangerousspeech.org/),"
at least two of which must be present for rhetoric to qualify: a
powerful speaker with a high degree of influence; a means of
dissemination that is influential in itself; an audience that has
grievances and fears the speaker can cultivate; a social or historical
context that is propitious for violence; and a speech act that is
clearly understood as a call to violence. At least the first four of
these indicators are currently present. Trump is the president of the
United States, and his rallies and Twitter feed provide a means of
direct communication to right-wing extremists, who clearly have
grievances he can cultivate and a history of violence. **[Republican

rocks, before trying to walk back the suggestion a day later. Enabling
can include actions that thwart efforts to combat extremism, as well as
those that encourage it. Trump has been a direct impediment to combating
right-wing extremism in several ways. First, **[he has largely
demolished the federal government infrastructure created to prevent
extremist violence by domestic actors]{.underline}**. Soon after taking
office, Trump [cut
money](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-budget-extremism/white-house-budget-slashes-countering-violent-extremism-grants-idUSKBN18J2HJ)

specifically. His administration
recently [indicated](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-admin-will-apparently-not-renew-program-fight-domestic-terror-n926361)that
it will end the program entirely. Second, **[the president has [refused
to single
out](https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/15/politics/trump-charlottesville-delay/index.html) right-wing
extremists for culpability after domestic terrorist attacks or to
disavow them in general. Scholars of political violence have [pointed
out](https://theconversation.com/terror-isnt-always-a-weapon-of-the-weak-it-can-also-support-the-powerful-82626) that
both of these actions may lead right-wing extremists to believe Trump
supports their views and will be more tolerant of extremist violence or
illegal acts than previous presidents]{.underline}**. Third, although
Trump has yet to interfere with an investigation or prosecution of
domestic terrorism, he [pardoned Joe
Arpaio](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/us/politics/joe-arpaio-trump-pardon-sheriff-arizona.html),
who is a hero to many on the far-right because of his aggressive efforts
against undocumented immigrants. The former Arizona sheriff received
a [criminal contempt
conviction](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/31/us/sheriff-joe-arpaio-convicted-arizona.html?module=inline) after
refusing a federal district court's demand that he cease routinely
violating the rights of Latinos based solely on the suspicion that they
were here illegally. Pardoning Arpaio was not only a clear blow to the
rule of law; it also suggested that crimes against immigrants were not
crimes and at all, and that the president viewed Arpaio's treatment as
heroic.

### **[A2 Biological terrorism]{.underline}**

#### Lack of evidence to support an impending bio attack + health care system, small timeframe, previous failed attacks, and its nearly impossible for a non-state actor to distribute the contagion

**Kolssak, 2015**

Intelligencer, 12 Oct. 2015,
<http://www.phcintelligencer.com/2015/10/12/bioterrorism-neither-likely-nor-practical/>)

Just one week after 9/11, a different kind of terrorist attack occurred.
A lone terrorist mailed an invisible weapon to US Congressmen and
journalists. The weapon of choice was dried anthrax---a deadly bacterium
that can become inactive when it forms spores. When these spores make
contact with the human body---especially when they are inhaled---they
trigger a deadly disease. [The anthrax attacks of 2001 left five people
dead]{.underline} and seventeen more ill.1 [In the wake of these
attacks, fears mounted that terrorist groups like al Qaeda could
weaponize biological agents]{.underline}. With the 2014 Ebola epidemic
and the growth of ISIS, these fears were once again brought to public
attention. The threat of bioterrorism remains a constant concern of US
health programs. Yet how dangerous is the use of bioterrorism as a
weapon of mass destruction? Recent research has led many to believe that
**[the threat is]{.underline}** largely **[overhyped]{.underline}**. In
response, the United States should conserve resources by adopting a
risk-based approach to biodefense research. ISIS and Bioterrorism
Concerns have risen that ISIS could weaponize a disease like Ebola.
Retired Captain Al Shimkus, a Professor of National Security Affairs at
the US Naval War College, warned that ISIS could infect human carriers
with the Ebola virus in an attempt to spread the disease. "In the
context of terrorist activity, it doesn't take much sophistication to go
to that next step to use a human being as a carrier," Shimkus told
Forbes in October 2014.2 In August 2014, moderate Syrian rebels found an
ISIS laptop in Syria. Foreign Policy magazine reported that the laptop
contained a 19-page document on how to develop biological weapons. It
belonged to a Tunisian national who had studied chemistry and physics at
a university.3 A few experts in a home laboratory with equipment bought
online can now create a bio-manufactured weapon that used to require the
resources of a nation-state to produce.4 The possibility of independent
groups using biological agents is much more tangible than it was in the
past. Yet, according to the Department of Homeland Security, [no
credible evidence can prove that the Islamic State is actively building
biological weapons capabilities]{.underline}.5 [Dr. Fillippa Lentzos, an
expert on bioterrorism, pointed out problems]{.underline} with ISIS's
potential use of Ebola: "[Could terrorists go to West Africa, get
infected, then come back and sit on the \[subway\]? Sure, but they're
not likely to be functional for very long]{.underline}. They're going to
be very sick and you'll see that. So they would have only a very small
window in which to operate. And [in a country with a developed public
health system...there would be plenty of chances to clamp down on an
outbreak]{.underline}."5 But the use of biological agents is not limited
to Ebola. Authorities are worried that terrorist groups like ISIS or al
Qaeda could also use anthrax, botulism, tularemia, or pneumonic plague
as bioweapons.6 Past Bioterrorism Attempts The record of attempted use
of biological weapons is very limited[. Most nations ended their
offensive biological weapons programs with the ratification of the
Biological Weapons Convention in 1972]{.underline}. The United States
ceased its programs in 1970, but continued biological weapons research
for defensive purposes. In April 1979, 68 people died in Sverdlovsk,
Russia, as a result of an anthrax leak from a Soviet bioweapons
facility. In 1995, the Iraqi government admitted that it had a program
to research and produce weaponized anthrax.7 [The anthrax attacks of
2001, dubbed "Amerithrax", are the most famous example of a biological
weapons attack.]{.underline}1 Letters sent through the mail laden with
dried anthrax spores killed five people and sickened seventeen.1 The
genetic strain used in the attack was specially engineered,
demonstrating that the perpetrator had access to US bioweapons research
facilities.7 [The investigation eventually centered on Bruce Ivans, a US
scientist.]{.underline} Ivans took his own life before federal
investigators could bring formal charges.8 Perhaps even [more relevant
are the failed bioterror attacks by the Japanese cultist group,
Aum]{.underline} Sinrikyo. In the late 1980s, [Aum spent millions of
dollars and employed a team of trained scientists to engineer advanced
biological agents]{.underline}. They experimented with botulinum toxin,
anthrax, cholera, and even Q fever [in hopes of producing enough
biological agent to trigger a global Armageddon.9 Aum had access to far
more scientific resources than any modern Islamist terror
group.]{.underline} In April 1990, the group used a fleet of trucks
equipped with aerosol sprayers to disperse liquid botulinum on the
Imperial Palace, the National Diet of Japan, the US Embassy in Tokyo,
and two US naval bases in Narita. **[No casualties resulted; no one
outside the cult even knew that the terrorist attacks had taken
place]{.underline}**.9 Three years later, in June and August of 1993,
Aum decided to switch to anthrax as its biological agent. This time, in
addition to its fleet of trucks, the group used aerosol sprayers mounted
on its headquarters building to create a cloud of anthrax over Tokyo.
Again, the attacks were unsuccessful and went unnoticed. It was only
after a successful 1995 subway attack using Sarin nerve gas (a chemical
agent) that investigations discovered the 1990 and 1993 attacks.9
Hollywood Has it Wrong [The historical record demonstrates that
weaponized biological agents have been used infrequently and
ineffectually.]{.underline} Terrorists want to spread destruction by any
means they can. [If bioterrorism really was effective, more terrorist
groups likely would have used pathogens as weapons by now]{.underline}.
The absence of widespread bioterrorism helps to show the gap between
current misconceptions and reality. One gram of anthrax contained within
one of the letters in 2001 had enough spores to kill thousands of
people. Combined, the amount of anthrax used in the attacks could have
killed millions.10 Yet the attacks only killed five. Even though the
anthrax terrorist had enough biological agent to kill millions, he did
not have the capability to distribute his weapon effectively. As the Aum
Shinrikyo biological attacks demonstrated, [even a sophisticated group
of scientists working to incite global Armageddon can find it difficult
to actually execute biological attacks]{.underline}. Terrorists have to
overcome a number of challenges in order to effectively convert
biological agents into weapons of mass destruction. [The use of a
pathogen]{.underline} as a biological agent [depends on the group's
ability to isolate a virulent strain, weaponize it, and then distribute
it.]{.underline} If the group could successfully isolate a dangerous
genetic strain, it would then turn to two possible methods of
distribution: aerosolized spray and human carriers.11 Most [non-state
actors do not possess the technology necessary to refine the aerosol
method]{.underline}. [Wind]{.underline} patterns [and
humidity]{.underline} can [render such an attack ineffective. The human
carrier method]{.underline} is less expensive but also has a number of
problems. It [requires the pathogen to be a contagion. Once the carrier
is infected, he must be mobile while contagious and cannot be visibly
ill---a situation that is unlikely with serious diseases]{.underline}
like Ebola.11 All other possible means of delivering a biological agent
are fraught with even more problems. Each potential biological agent
also has individual reasons why it would not make an effective weapon of
terror. Ebola is only transmitted through direct contact with the bodily
fluids of someone infected with the disease.12 Anthrax is not easily
transmitted across individuals and is unlikely to spark an epidemic.
Anthrax can also be treated by readily available antibiotics if noticed
in time.9 Even incredibly [deadly biological agents]{.underline} like
ricin and botulinum [are hard to use in mass attacks due to the
difficulty in converting them into a weaponized form that can be readily
dispersed.]{.underline}

#### The threat is overblown & we're prepared

**Kolssak, 2015**

(Spencer, "BIOTERRORISM: NEITHER LIKELY NOR PRACTICAL," The
Intelligencer, 12 Oct. 2015,
<http://www.phcintelligencer.com/2015/10/12/bioterrorism-neither-likely-nor-practical/>)

[The United States has developed an intensive bio-preparedness
program]{.underline}. According to a Scientific American scorecard in
2014, [the United States ranked first out of 55 nations in biotechnology
by a very large margin.13 The United States has 14 discrete biodefense
R&D programs]{.underline}, less than half of which exist under the DoD.
The other programs reside under the Environmental Protection Agency, the
Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of
Homeland Security. During the 2011 to 2014 period, Department of
Homeland Security's biodefense funding increased by around 40% while
combined funding for human health programs under Department of Health
and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control have increased by
18%.13 Different [agencies also have bio-threat detection
systems]{.underline}. For instance, Department of Homeland Security
subjects travelers who have recently been in Ebola-infected areas to
intensive screening.14 [Studies show that government programs
over-emphasize the threat of biological attacks.]{.underline} A study
conducted by the RAND Corporation from 1997 to 2010 examined a mix of
1,593 federally-funded national health security research
projects---including those by the Centers for Disease Control and
Department of Homeland Security. The researchers found that over 1,000
of the initiatives, or 66 percent, were dedicated to biological threats,
including bioterrorism. 10 percent of the projects focused on natural
disasters, 8 percent addressed chemical threats, 5 percent examined
radiological issues, 4 percent addressed nuclear threats, and the
remaining 4 percent focused on explosives.15 Dr. Art Kellermann, chief
analyst at RAND, commented, "The current mix of federally-funded
national health security research projects may not be ideally configured
for achieving the broad preparedness goals that face our nation."15 To
resolve this problem, US agencies should implement two reforms. First,
each of the agencies studied determines its own research priorities with
little effort to coordinate with other agencies. Biodefense programs
should increase their cooperation and information-sharing methods.
Second, current priorities do not accurately reflect the likelihood of
possible threats. Agencies should move toward implementing a risk-based
system that allocates priorities based on threat probability and
magnitude.15 Whenever an outbreak occurs or a dangerous disease breaks
loose, public panic and paranoia ensue. This response is somewhat
understandable; the potential consequences of an invisible, weaponized
super-disease are indeed frightening. Yet these perceptions are flawed.
[The media---and to some extent government agencies---over-hypes the
threat of pandemics and bioterrorism.]{.underline} To be sure,
governments should always be prepared to prevent and combat such
threats. However, [recent research suggests that the US government
focuses too much attention on the threat of biological
warfare]{.underline} and not enough on other pressing issues. Both a
proper understanding of the threat posed by bioterrorism and a proper
balance of priorities are necessary if the United States wants to
prepare itself for all potential dangers to the nation's security.

### **[A2 Nuclear terrorism]{.underline}**

#### No nuclear terror

**Bunn and Roth, 2017**

(Matthew -- professor @ Harvard and former for the White House Office of
Science and Technology, Nikolas -- researcher @ Harvard and the
University of Maryland, focuses on nuclear security and arms control,
"The effects of a single terrorist nuclear bomb," Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, 28 Sept. 2017,
<https://thebulletin.org/2017/09/the-effects-of-a-single-terrorist-nuclear-bomb/>)

Prevention: The essential remedy. Given the horrifying consequences of
such an event, while there is certainly a need to be better prepared to
respond, the primary focus must be on prevention. Fortunately, there is
good news on this front. To date, [there is no evidence that nuclear
weapons or the materials needed to make them have ever fallen into the
hands of a terrorist group; even large and sophisticated terrorist
groups that have tried to get nuclear weapons have failed to do
so]{.underline}; and [the international community has taken a wide range
of actions over the past quarter-century]{.underline} (and particularly
over the 2010-2016 period of the nuclear security summits) [that have
drastically improved the security measures for nuclear weapons and
materials around the world]{.underline}. Nevertheless, while the chance
of such a nightmare unfolding is probably small, it is certainly not
small enough to justify complacency. Al Qaeda had a focused effort to
acquire nuclear weapons that reported directly to Ayman al-Zawahiri, now
the group's leader, and included multiple attempts to get nuclear
material and recruit nuclear expertise; Al Qaeda progressed as far as
carrying out crude conventional explosive tests for their bomb program
in the Afghan desert. The Japanese terror cult Aum Shinrikyo---the group
that launched nerve gas attacks in the Tokyo subway in 1995--- also
pursued nuclear weapons. [To date, there are only hints of nuclear
interest from the Islamic State]{.underline}, but if it did turn to
nuclear pursuits, even with the imminent defeat of its geographic
caliphate in Iraq and Syria, it still has more money, people, and
ability to recruit experts globally than most past terrorist groups,
raising a serious concern. With at least two terrorist groups having
pursued nuclear weapons over the past quarter-century, and possibly
more, it is unlikely they will be the last. Moreover, the past seizures
of stolen weapons-usable nuclear material demonstrate that nuclear
security failures have occurred at some point in the past. While nuclear
security has improved dramatically in many countries in the past
quarter-century, the possibility that terrorists could get the essential
ingredients of a nuclear bomb still cannot be ruled out. What then, must
be done? First, major efforts are needed to recover some of the momentum
imparted to nuclear security programs by the now-completed nuclear
security summit process, revitalizing efforts to address remaining
weaknesses. Second, because nuclear security is unlikely to be perfect,
other layers of defense are needed to cope with nuclear material that
has already been stolen, including stronger anti-nuclear smuggling
efforts (especially national police and intelligence teams), better
intelligence focused on nuclear smuggling, beefed-up interdiction
abilities if intelligence identifies where such items are located, and
improved means of detecting efforts to bring a nuclear weapon or its
pieces into major cities. Third, deterrence can play a part,
particularly in convincing states never to consciously provide nuclear
weapons or materials to terrorists ---and toward that end, continued
investments in [nuclear
forensics](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/12966/nuclear-forensics-a-capability-at-risk-abbreviated-version)
capabilities are needed, to help identify where nuclear material might
have come from. Fourth, more intelligence effort---and more
international intelligence cooperation---is needed that is targeted on
identifying and stopping terrorist plots aimed at nuclear terrorism, and
dismantling groups that may harbor such ambitions. [No one knows what
the real probability of nuclear terrorism is. It may well be quite low.
There is no need for panic, which is exactly what terrorists have sought
to achieve by repeatedly claiming to have nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
But there is a need for prudent, focused action. Given the scale of the
consequences, the countries of the world have an obligation to do
everything in their power to ensure that the dark day after a terrorist
nuclear blast never comes.

#### No nuclear terrorism -- most qualified piece of evidence on this question 

**McIntosh and Storrey, 2018**

(Christopher -- visiting professor of political studies at Bard College,
Ian - fellow at the Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities at
Bard College, "Between Acquisition and Use: Assessing the Likelihood of
Nuclear Terrorism." International Studies Quarterly 62.2 (2018):
289-300)

Our approach offers a point of departure for strategically assessing the
options, likely responses, and potential outcomes that could arise from
the different paths available to a nuclear-armed non-state group. [Too
often analysts treat the decision by such groups to use nuclear weapons
as if it occurs in a vacuum. In practice, terrorist groups face many
short-term and long-term considerations. They are influenced by factors
both external and internal to their organization. These include the
potential for backlash among supporters, internal
factionalization]{.underline} over nuclear strategy and doctrine, [and
an overwhelming response by the target state and the international
community]{.underline}. Moreover, we suggest a way to bring the
recursivity of strategic choice into the account of terrorist
organizational decision-making. These organizations must consider the
long-term effects of a nuclear attack. An attack occurs in the context
of an ongoing campaign by a well-established organization[. Opportunity
costs exist because escalating to nuclear attack forecloses future
options.]{.underline} As well, conducting [an attack may]{.underline}
not only [preclude]{.underline} other strategies, but [the continued
existence of the group itself.]{.underline} This changes the game
significantly. In most cases, a nuclear attack must present not just an
effective option for the moment, but the only strategic option worth
pursuing going forward. Once we take these considerations into account,
the detonation of [a nuclear weapon]{.underline} generally [appears the
least strategically advantageous option for non-state
groups]{.underline}. Indeed, the factors presented here are analytically
independent, adaptable, and scalable to particular threat contexts. We
can therefore use our framework to study the opportunities and
constraints faced by specific future groups. It should therefore assist
in the process of planning responses to potential nuclear acquisition by
terrorist groups. Successive [governments have]{.underline} now
[identified nuclear terrorism as a critical concern]{.underline} in the
formulation of security policy. [This line of thinking systematically
underspecifies, or simply misunderstands, key considerations that
terrorist organizations take into account. These include the group's
organizational survival, opportunity costs, and the conflation of
victory with the end of hostilities. Each factor presents strong
disincentives to]{.underline} immediate [nuclear attack]{.underline}. A
nucleararmed terrorist group is exceedingly dangerous, but for different
reasons than normally assumed. The options available to the group that
fall short of detonation or attack remain considerable, albeit less
spectacular and immediate. Just as scholars like Bunn et al. (2015) are
careful to do, [political actors]{.underline} and analysts [should
resist uncritically deploying the term "nuclear terrorism]{.underline}"
in an umbrella fashion. This point goes beyond even the attempts at
disaggregating "use" presented here. The threat of an attack involving
an improvised nuclear device is vastly different than that of a "dirty
bomb," and both have little in common with the threat posed by an attack
on a nuclear facility. Each deserves separate consideration when
formulating policy, even if measures taken to address these concerns,
such as controlling nuclear leakage, ultimately overlap. If any of the
acquisition or threat scenarios we explore come to fruition, then
potential target states will need strategies that potentially employ
positive, as well as negative, incentives to lessen the attractiveness
of nuclear attack. As we argue, a crisis involving a nuclear-armed
terrorist group will be a negotiation--- regardless of what the target
state chooses to label it. Far from demonstrating weakness, employing
threats while dangling the possibility of political concessions can
widen internal divisions, heightening the overall organizational costs
of escalating violence (Toros 2008; Cronin 2009). Finally, efforts
designed to improve intelligence capabilities both prior to and
post-attack remain vital. Signature analysis as a forensic measure has
shown promise as a way of identifying the origin of nuclear
material---in some cases it can identify whether or not it was provided
by a state (Kristo and Tumey 2013). These efforts would be improved with
a more widespread international commitment via the IAEA to placing
signature markers in weapons and weaponizable material (Korbatov et al.
2015, 70; Findlay 2014, 6). Ultimately, when it comes to the threat of a
nuclear attack by a terrorist, [presumption should lie squarely on the
side of skepticism]{.underline} rather than inevitability. While some
terrorist organizations have some incentives for nuclear acquisition,
paradoxically and thankfully, the most strategic uses of a nuclear
weapon fall well short of actual nuclear attack. From a scholarly
perspective, as well as a political one, we need to start to think
through how states would act in a world with nuclear-armed non-state
actors. In doing so, we should avoid assumptions that fit neither with
known nuclear strategy nor the empirical behavior of non-state
organizations. Like most clichés, [the]{.underline} post--Cold War
[trope that the threat of attack is higher now]{.underline} than it was
during the US-USSR arms race (Litwak 2016) [obscures much more than it
reveals.]{.underline}

#### Internal and external pressures prevent a terrorist nuclear attack

**McIntosh and Storrey, 2018**

(Christopher -- visiting professor of political studies at Bard College,
Ian - fellow at the Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities at
Bard College, "Between Acquisition and Use: Assessing the Likelihood of
Nuclear Terrorism." International Studies Quarterly 62.2 (2018):
289-300)

Beyond these supporters, [a nuclear attack affects the internal dynamics
of the terrorist organization in multiple ways. There could be
divisiveness]{.underline} regarding the most effective use of the
weapon. This would be magnified by the scale of the opportunities and
perceived opportunity costs. [Such debates have the potential to
splinter the organization]{.underline} as a whole (Cronin 2009,
100--02). [Factional conflict in terrorist organizations appears
frequently]{.underline} over questions of goals and tactics (Crenshaw
1981; Chai 1993). A decision to attack with [a nuclear weapon risks
considerable internal alienation]{.underline} over a variety of
issues---targeting decisions, method of attack, campaign goals,
potential deaths of supporters, and the domestic and international
response (Mathew and Shambaugh 2005, 621--22). Finally, [a nuclear
attack would exponentially raise the threat to each individual who
composes the extended organization. Post-nuclear attack, the greatest
strengths of a terrorist organization---its lack of material territory,
economy, or overt institutions and reliance on individuals---could turn
into its greatest weaknesses]{.underline} (Eilstrup-Sangiovanni and
Jones 2008). Currently, a wealthy financier found to have ties to a
terrorist group would be monitored for intelligence, arrested, and
brought up on criminal charges. Post-nuclear attack, the consequences
would be immediate and rather worse. Externally, in a world post-nuclear
attack[, international cooperation would be instant and
deep.]{.underline} One of the only international treaties to even define
a terrorist in international law post-2001 has been the Nuclear
Terrorism Convention (Edwards 2005). A nuclear attack would be far
outside the norm of international politics. [It would]{.underline}
disrupt the dominance of state-actors and [likely stimulate unparalleled
cooperation to apprehend the responsible parties to prevent future
attacks.]{.underline} Moreover, many large [terrorist organizations
require]{.underline} (some) tacit acquiescence by [a host
state]{.underline}. Even those with hostile host states have territory
where they remain relatively unaffected by local governments (Korteweg
2008). [Post-nuclear attack, these host states face an enormous
incentive to find the actors responsible before the target state
does]{.underline}. After an attack, regimes would find it difficult to
claim that they "didn't know" or "couldn't stop them." Claims of
corruption or ineffective institutions would be unlikely to find much
sympathy. [Faced with potential organizational extinction itself, a host
state/government will likely be much less committed to the survival of
the terrorist group.]{.underline} This is likely to vary significantly
from how they might otherwise behave after a more conventional attack.
For these states, there would be a real fear of "Talibanization" and
ruthless attempts at regime change post-attack. From the perspective of
the group, it would know that it could be facing a unified international
community and the removal of tacit state support. It would take a
particularly confident leadership to presume it could continue to
function post-attack without massive disruptions. [Most strategic actors
are risk-averse when facing the potential of complete elimination. There
is little reason to believe terrorist groups would act any
differently.]{.underline}

### **[A2 Hegemony]{.underline}**

#### Heg is [ineffective]{.underline} and causes [instability]{.underline}\-\--[no causal relationship]{.underline} with peace

**Fettweis, 17** -- Associate Professor of Political Science at Tulane
University (Christopher, "Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace,"
*Security Studies*, 26:3, 423-451, 5-8-2017,

Conflict and Hegemony by Region

Even the most ardent supporters of the hegemonic-stability explanation
do not contend that US influence extends equally to all corners of the
globe. The United States has concentrated its policing in what George
Kennan used to call "strong points," or the most important parts of the
world: Western Europe, the Pacific Rim, and Persian Gulf.64 By doing so,
Washington may well have contributed more to great power peace than the
overall global decline in warfare. If the former phenomenon contributed
to the latter, by essentially providing a behavioral model for weaker
states to emulate, then perhaps this lends some support to the
hegemonic-stability case.65 During the Cold War, the United States
played referee to a few intra-West squabbles, especially between Greece
and Turkey, and provided Hobbesian reassurance to Germany's nervous
neighbors. **[[Other]{.underline}]{.mark}**, equally plausible
**[[explanations exist for stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the first
world, [[including]{.underline}]{.mark} the [presence of a [common
enemy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[economic
interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[general war aversion]{.mark},
etc]{.underline}. The looming presence of the leviathan is certainly
among these plausible explanations, but only inside the US sphere of
influence. Bipolarity was bad for the nonaligned world, where Soviet and
Western intervention routinely exacerbated local conflicts. [Unipolarity
has]{.underline} generally [been]{.underline} much [better]{.underline},
[but whether or not this was due to US action is again
**unclear**]{.underline}. Overall [US interest in]{.underline} the
affairs of [the Global South]{.underline} has [dropped
markedly]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War, as has the level of
violence in almost all regions. [There is less US
intervention]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the political and military
affairs of [Latin America]{.underline} compared to any time in the
twentieth century, for instance, [and]{.underline} also [less
conflict]{.underline}. [Warfare in Africa is at an all-time
low]{.underline}, as is relative US interest outside of counterterrorism
and security assistance.66 [[Regional peace and stability exist where
there is US active intervention]{.underline}]{.mark}, [as well as where
there is not]{.underline}. [**[No direct relationship seems to exist
across regions]{.underline}**.]{.mark} If intervention can be considered
a function of direct and indirect activity, of both political and
military action, a regional picture might look like what is outlined in
Table 1. These assessments of conflict are by necessity relative,
because there has not been a "high" level of conflict in any region
outside the Middle East during the period of the New Peace. Putting
aside for the moment that important caveat, some points become clear.
The great powers of the world are clustered in the upper right quadrant,
where US intervention has been high, but conflict levels low. [[US
intervention is **imperfectly correlated** with
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}, however. Indeed, it is conceivable that
the relatively [[high level]{.mark} of US]{.underline} interest and
[[activity]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[made]{.underline}
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} security situation in the [**[Persian
Gulf]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} broader **[[Middle East
worse]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In recent years, substantial [[hard
power]{.mark} investments]{.underline} ([Somalia]{.underline},
[Afghanistan]{.underline}, [Iraq]{.underline}), [moderate
intervention]{.underline} ([Libya]{.underline}), [and reliance on
diplomacy]{.underline} ([Syria]{.underline}) [[have been **equally
ineffective**]{.underline}]{.mark} in [stabilizing states torn by
conflict]{.underline}. While it is possible that the region is
essentially unpacifiable and no amount of police work would bring peace
to its people, [it remains hard to make the case]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} the [US presence]{.underline} has [improved
matters]{.underline}. In this "strong point," at least, **[[US hegemony
has failed to bring peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In much of the rest of
the world, the United States has not been especially eager to enforce
any particular rules. Even rather incontrovertible evidence of genocide
has not been enough to inspire action. [Washington's intervention
choices have at best been erratic]{.underline}; Libya and Kosovo brought
about action, but [much more blood flowed uninterrupted]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} [Rwanda]{.underline}, [Darfur]{.underline},
[Congo]{.underline}, [Sri Lanka]{.underline}, [and Syria]{.underline}.
[[The US record of peacemaking is not exactly a long uninterrupted
string of successes]{.underline}]{.mark}. During the turn-of-the-century
conventional war between Ethiopia and Eritrea, a highlevel US delegation
containing former and future National Security Advisors (Anthony Lake
and Susan Rice) made a half-dozen trips to the region, but was unable to
prevent either the outbreak or recurrence of the conflict. Lake and his
team shuttled back and forth between the capitals with some frequency,
and President Clinton made repeated phone calls to the leaders of the
respective countries, offering to hold peace talks in the United States,
all to no avail.67 The war ended in late 2000 when Ethiopia essentially
won, and it controls the disputed territory to this day. [The Horn of
Africa is hardly the only region where states are free to
fight]{.underline} one another today [without fear of]{.underline}
serious [US involvement]{.underline}. Since they are choosing not to do
so with increasing frequency, [something else is probably affecting
their calculations]{.underline}. Stability exists even in those places
where the potential for intervention by the sheriff is minimal.
Hegemonic stability can only take credit for influencing those decisions
that would have ended in war without the presence, whether physical or
psychological, of the United States. [[It seems hard to make the case
that]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[relative peace]{.underline}]{.mark} that
has [[descended on]{.underline}]{.mark} so many
[[regions]{.underline}]{.mark} is primarily [[due
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the kind of heavy hand of the
[[neoconservative]{.underline} [leviathan]{.underline}]{.mark}, or its
lighter, more liberal cousin. **[[Something else appears to be at
work]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### **[A2 EU Nationalism]{.underline}**

#### Nationalist parties won't take over -- electoral gains are slowing down & terrorist attacks aren't boosting them

**Charlemagne 19** (Charlemagne, May 26th 2019. Populists fall short of
expectations in the European elections,
https://www.economist.com/charlemagnes-notebook/2019/05/26/populists-fall-short-of-expectations-in-the-european-elections

This evening's result in **[the European elections]{.underline}**
provides some answers to that, and **[caveat the more excitable
commentaries]{.underline}** about the rise of nationalists in Europe.
Turnout is up for the first time ever, and at 51% higher than in any
European election since 1994. And yes, the right-populists have done
well again. The Lega is first in Italy, Ms Le Pen's National Rally has
narrowly beaten Emmanuel Macron to first place in France, PiS came first
in Poland despite running against a mostly unified opposition ticket.
But it is also clear that **[the mighty, breakneck populist surge of a
couple of years ago---with Britain voting to leave the EU, populists
topping polls all over the continent and a cataclysmic nationalist
takeover threatening---is over. Nationalists are now]{.underline}**
consolidating their gains and **[settling]{.underline}**
**[into]{.underline}** a much broader pattern: that of
**[fragmentation]{.underline}**. Consider the numbers. **[Ms Le Pen's
result is down on 2014]{.underline}**, the previous European election.
So is the Austrian Freedom Party and, more drastically, the **[Danish
People's Party]{.underline}** and the Party for Freedom in the
Netherlands. It is true that some of the latter's support has switched
to Forum for Democracy, a rival right-populist outfit. But this too
**[underperformed expectations and the overall seat-share of Dutch
Eurosceptics has halved]{.underline}**. **[Alternative for Germany also
disappointed its boosters]{.underline}**: on 10.8% it only modestly
increased its support on 2014 and did less well than in the 2017
Bundestag election. The Lega has made big gains, but it too seems to
have done worse than was generally expected and its wins only just make
up for losses elsewhere. (Even in Britain, where the Brexit party came
first, it effectively replaced the United Kingdom Independence Party,
which won in 2014.) Overall **[the]{.underline}** three
**[Eurosceptic]{.underline}** or hard-right **[groups]{.underline}** in
the European Parliament have, according to the parliament's own
projection, **[increased their seat share from 21% to 23%. Hardly a
surge and oddly static after five years that have seen Europe face a
migration crisis, the Brexit vote, terror attacks and the wholesale
fragmentation of the continent's politics]{.underline}**. Of that
fragmentation there was much more evidence. The Green group is projected
to swell in size from 52 seats to 70 seats, thanks especially to the
German Green party's 21% showing (taking second place and overtaking the
doughty Social Democrats to become the largest party on the German
left). The centrist Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will
grow from 69 to a projected 101 seats, with Mr Macron's Renaissance
joining and immediately becoming its largest member. Meanwhile the two
big losers are the big-tent party families that have together run Europe
as an informal "grand coalition": the centre-right European People's
Party (EPP) and the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D). Their
joint tally falls from 401 seats (54%) to a projected 325 seats (43%).

#### Populism declining now

**Reith 17** (Charles Reith, Bachelor's [Syracuse
University](https://www.linkedin.com/edu/syracuse-university-19054?trk=ppro_sprof),
Are we witnessing the decline of Europe's right wing firebrands?,
6/16/17,
https://portland-communications.com/2017/06/16/are-we-witnessing-the-decline-of-europes-right-wing-firebrands/

[2016 was the year of the right wing populism]{.underline} in Western
politics. Trump, Farage, Le Pen and others in their molds saw huge
surges in support, if not outright -- and often stunning -- wins.
Voters, tired of starched and sanitised political professionals were
attracted to straight-talking anti-establishment figures and for a
while, it seemed that the right had a monopoly on charisma. [But the
elections so far in 2017 have shown that this is changing]{.underline}.
Right wing parties that were credible electoral forces just a year ago
now seem dead in the water. [In the recent UK election UKIP slipped from
winning 13% of the national vote share in 2015 to returning just under
2%, losing their only seat in the House.]{.underline} Perhaps more
bruisingly, [a local election two months earlier]{.underline} had
[robbed them of all but one of their councillors. This is not just a UK
phenomenon]{.underline}. Elsewhere, [right wing movements are failing to
continue the gains that their performances last year would
suggest]{.underline}. [Marine Le Pen]{.underline} reached the final
round of France's Presidential contest but in the
[s]{.underline}ubsequent legislative election her [vote share nearly
halved from 21% to 13%.]{.underline} Similarly[, the True Finns
have]{.underline} this week [been thrown out of Finland's governing
coalition]{.underline} after a damaging split led over half their MPs to
desert them in favour of forming a more moderate grouping. When a single
issue party disappears, it can sometimes be taken as a sign of success.
The popular policies that had been central to their appeal have been
adopted by the mainstream. In the UK, UKIP has struggled to find a
purpose now that Brexit is a reality. With the Conservatives and Labour
both committed to leaving the EU, its brand of blazer and cravat
politics has failed to appeal to voters. The same can be said of Geert
Wilders' Freedom Party, which saw its political oxygen drawn away as
Mark Rutte, now Dutch Prime Minister, broadened his political stance to
include anti-immigration policies. [In the case of broader right wing
movements]{.underline} however, [we have seen moderate or left wing
forces more effectively able to harness populist sentiments]{.underline}
and mount a credible challenge. Theresa May was not denied her majority
because the Conservative vote share fell. On the contrary [the Tories
saw their highest vote share since 1983]{.underline}. But Jeremy Corbyn,
seen as the political outsider, amassed thousands of votes that normally
go to protest parties or simply do not get cast. In France, En Marche,
the political movement founded by Emmanuel Macron, has swept to victory
on the back of Obama-style political rallies and the youthful charisma
of the new president. Similarly, in Austria, [the fears of a far-right
political takeover by the Freedom Party have been mollified by the rise
of Sebastian Kurz, the 30 year old centre-right Foreign
Minister.]{.underline} For now, these are early observations of a trend
that may emerge more clearly by the end of the year. It's also important
to note that no-one is forecasting the permanent end of right wing
zealotry. However, in the era of social media politics, populism is here
to stay as a tool for both the left and the right. As with any powerful
weapon, we should be reassured when the arms race is at its most
balanced.

### **[A2 EU collapse - inevitable]{.underline}**

#### Multiple factors drive EU decline

**Fici 18** (Francesco Fici, Experienced researcher with a Master\'s
degree in European Studies from the London School of Economics, February
10, 2018. The EU Has Lost Its Way: The Real Reasons for Brexit,
https://themarketmogul.com/european-brexit-vote/

While extensive international media coverage has been dedicated to the
ongoing political bargaining, much less attention has been devoted
towards addressing the real roots of
[Brexit](https://themarketmogul.com/brexit-cost-untold/). The absence of
such analysis risks exacerbating divisions and misunderstandings on both
sides of the Channel. To be sure, in the months following the
referendum, **[many tried to address this complex issue]{.underline}**.
Some highlighted the role played by the so-called "left behind".
**[For]{.underline}** these **[analysts]{.underline}**, **[Brexit
is]{.underline}** mainly **[the result of]{.underline}** a widespread
perception among British voters of decades of rising **[inequality,
economic stagnation and]{.underline}** increased
**[insecurity]{.underline}**. Others have **[emphasised the role played
by]{.underline}** unscrupulous politicians who astutely played with
voters' emotions, with arguments about **[sovereignty and control of
migration]{.underline}**, ultimately winning the day. Arguably, all
these arguments contain some truth. Nevertheless, **[they
neglect]{.underline}** the **[complexity]{.underline}** of the UK's
idiosyncratic approach vis-à-vis the project **[of European
integration.]{.underline}** Behind the Curtain Thus, we are left asking
ourselves the same question, namely, **[what were the real causes of
Brexit?]{.underline}** This article seeks to answer this question by
challenging the assumption that Brexit was first and foremost a vote
against the failing neoliberal agenda and the cosmopolitan metropolitan
elites who promoted it. Rather, it contends that, first and foremost,
the decision to leave the EU must be understood within the framework of
Great Britain's traditional scepticism towards the European federalist
vision and specifically, its historical conception of the Balance of
Power in Europe. While discussing the outcome of the Brexit referendum,
many commentators often fail to consider Great Britain's traditional
scepticism towards the European federalist vision and in general, its
historical concept of Balance of Power. Euroscepticism in the UK is not
a by-product of Boris Jonson's successful slogan bus "We send the EU
£350m a week: let's fund our NHS instead". Nor is it just the result of
a campaign dominated by scaremongering and the misuse of statistics.
Long-Standing Euroscepticism Instead, the UK's brand of Euroscepticism
reflects Britain's traditional opposition to the belief that the best
way to reconcile and mediate Europe's different economic, political,
cultural and ethnic groupings is to establish a supranational
government. This supranational vision was the normative doctrine that
drove the ambition of Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman and Altiero Spinelli
in building the foundations of a federal Europe. Britain, on the other
hand, has historically been reluctant of entering into permanent
European commitments. In the seventeenth century, England pioneered the
concept of the "balance of power". From the British perspective, the
supreme goal of international politics was to maintain the equilibrium
between the most powerful actors, while ensuring no great power could
dominate others. As such, it was England's style to abandon its minimal
involvement in European affairs only when the balance of power was under
attack. For instance, Britain supported France against the threat of
"universal dominion" from the Habsburgs in the 17th century and opposed
French hegemony under Napoleon later. Equally, it fought Nazi Germany
and Fascist Italy during the 20th century. If one subscribes to the view
that it was the very idea of never again taking up arms against each
other that pushed the EU's founding fathers to launch their project,
then it is reasonable to presume that London never felt this need in the
same way. Accordingly, the UK never really shared the great ambitions of
the EU Treaties, especially that of an "ever closer union" with other
members. In fact, since joining the European Communities in 1973, the UK
has remained a suspicious member of the European project and repeatedly
resisted important steps towards further European integration. A
Sceptical Member State When its European partners enthusiastically
launched a common currency in 1992, the UK chose to be exempt from
joining the euro; when the European Communities incorporated the
Schengen free border system in 1997 and abolished internal controls,
Britain opted out; when the EU enacted documents in the domain of social
rights in 2000 (the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
Union), Britain pulled out from the new common rules. Finally, during
the euro crisis, the UK opposed forms of financial assistance to
Eurozone countries in fiscal stress and decided not to sign the Fiscal
Compact. These decisions taken by Britain raise an important question,
especially in the aftermath of Brexit: Why did Britain join the European
Communities in the first place? The UK application to the European
Communities in 1961 was precipitated by the humiliating experience of
the Suez crisis, which destroyed England's status as a world power, and
a decline in the UK's economy compared to its European partners. After
the loss of the empire, Britain, for the first time in its history, saw
a united Europe as an opportunity for economic prosperity and a way to
enhance its international status on the world stage. More importantly,
it can be argued that the UK saw the EU as an institutionalised "balance
of power" designed to contain any potential hegemonic aspirations and
capable of ensuring that stability which Britain couldn't pursue on its
own anymore. However, in the run-up to the Brexit vote, many things have
changed. A Union that Has Lost Its Way Among these, **[the continent's
strongest economic power has come to dictate the terms under which
struggling Eurozone nations can apply for further credit, thus eroding
the sovereignty of these countries' parliaments]{.underline}**. As
stated by Kalypso Nicolaïdis, Professor of International Relations at
the University of Oxford and director of the Centre for International
Studies, "**[After the euro crisis, many states and not only Britain
have felt that the EU's balance of power set-up is no longer in
equilibrium]{.underline}**".

#### Conflict over the euro outweighs

**Kimmage 18** Professor of History at The Catholic University of
America, What Happened to the European Union,
<https://newrepublic.com/article/146524/happened-european-union>

The EU's vaunted soft power is useless against Putin's Russia, and it
has been irrelevant in the Syrian civil war. Conflict in Syria has sent
hundreds of thousands of migrants in the direction of Europe, as has
chaos in North Africa. Disorder in the Middle East is more acutely a
European than an American problem: Islamist terrorism flows more easily
into the EU than it does into the United States. Since 2015, Russia has
shown itself to be a more consequential actor in Syria than the pacifist
EU. Russia has succeeded in propping up Assad and has been trying since
January 2017 to supplant the "Geneva" diplomatic process for a post-war
settlement in Syria, in which the West is involved, with the "Astana"
process, in which the West is not involved. [Europe's economic
tribulations run north-south rather than east-west. It has proven
difficult to manage a single currency shared by diverse national
economies, not all of which are well aligned with one another. In
particular, Germany's taste for austerity at home and across Europe,
augmented by the advantages that have accrued to German exports from the
Euro, has exposed a rift between a prospering north and a suffering
south. Most likely, the German electorate would not tolerate a departure
from austerity, and German workers do a great deal to fund the EU. At
the same time, southern Europe's economic misery has created the
perception of German indifference or worse.]{.underline} This perception
sharpened when in September 2015, as Drozdiak writes, "Merkel did not
bother consulting with other EU leaders before deciding to fling open
Germany's doors" to migrants. Culture is Europe's third fault line. The
European project today does not have a solid cultural foundation. In a
pattern familiar from American politics, more educated and cosmopolitan
Europeans tend to favor the EU, while populist and other assaults on the
EU rise up from rural and economically depressed areas. The EU has a
long record of faring badly when national populations vote on its
policies in referenda. A decade before Brexit, French and Dutch voters
rejected an EU constitution, demonstrating the limits of popular support
for greater European integration. Nothing quite captures the EU's
popularity deficit than the superbly cynical quote from Jean-Claude
Juncker, President of the European Commission: "We all know what to do,
we just don't know how to get re-elected after we've done it." Put
differently, Juncker and his colleagues really do not know what to do.
Europe's challenges are not intractable. They could be resolved by the
EU's evolution into a republic, with well-defined borders, an army and a
top-down capacity to balance the economic disparities that have made
Germany so skeptical of Greece and Greece so skeptical of Germany. This
republic could inculcate a republican identity in order to be buoyed by
a shared and singular political culture. Or Europe's challenges could be
resolved by reducing the EU to a confederation, which is what the
European project was in the 1950s. This would be painful. It would
involve untangling bureaucracies that have long been joined. But
countries that have reclaimed more of their sovereignty may be better at
cooperating on core issues of security and economics, without requiring
the cultural homogeneity to which Europe has never been prone. Since
2003, what Drozdiak describes as "the world's first postmodern
superpower" has come down to earth. In the future, it will be less
postmodern, less historically anomalous, less of a theoretical novelty
and more like a traditional confederation or a traditional republic. By
moving closer together or further apart, the countries of Europe will
hopefully achieve a more lasting union. To do so would be to heal the
fractures that currently scar the continent.

[Support for populist radical right]{.underline} (PRR) [parties and
movements has swelled in previous decades]{.underline} (Backes and
Moreau, 2012). This has triggered extensive scholarly debate, which
often focuses on electoral politics -- for recent reviews on PRR
parties, see Golder (2016), Greven (2016) and Mudde (2016). A strict
division of labour seems to divide sociologists from political
scientists, with each discipline focusing on the non-electoral and
electoral channel, respectively (Rydgren, 2007). Social movement
protests have generally been dominated by 'the left', while 'the right'
mainly uses the electoral channel to voice its discontent, instead of
taking to the street (Hutter, 2014). Consequently, social movement
scholars focus on egalitarian movements that promote change, rather than
reactionary movements (Hirsch-Hoefler and Mudde, 2013). They tend to
overlook the most important contemporary actors mobilizing against the
consequences of globalization and immigration: the populist radical
right (Hutter and Kriesi, 2013). As Caiani et al. (2012: 4) put it:
'social movement studies ... \[have\] been slow to address the "bad
side" of social movement activism'. Only when sociologists widen their
perspective to the electoral channel, can we fully grasp the
implications of globalization and large-scale immigration for political
contention. This article reviews the scholarship on both PRR parties and
movements in contemporary European democracies. First, we discuss the
definitional debate about what constitutes the populist radical right
(PRR) family. Second, we review demand-side and supply-side explanations
for the fortunes of PRR parties and movements. Third, we discuss
research on the consequences of the emergence and rise of PRR parties
and movements. The review concludes with a discussion of the future
directions that theorizing and research could take. Go to: Definitional
debate on radical right-wing populism Different labels such as 'extreme
right' (Arzheimer, 2009; Bale, 2003; Lubbers et al., 2002), 'far right'
(Golder, 2016: Williams, 2010) and 'populist radical right' (Mudde,
2007) are used interchangeably to refer to the same organizations, such
as the French Front National (FN), Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) and
Flemish Bloc/Flemish Interest (VB). A consensus has emerged that they
constitute one single family. [The most important common denominator is
their exclusionist, ethno-nationalist notion of
citizenship]{.underline}, [reflected in the slogan 'own people
first']{.underline} (Betz, 1994; Rydgren, 2005a). [This nativist stance
means that states should be inhabited exclusively by members of the
native group]{.underline} (the nation) [and that non-native
elements]{.underline} (persons and ideas) [threaten homogeneous
nation-states]{.underline} (Mudde, 2007). [The label 'radical' thus
refers to the outspoken position at the far end of the political
spectrum on issues related to immigration and ethnic
diversity]{.underline} (Akkerman et al., 2016). Since they strongly hold
issue-ownership over immigration issues (Abou-Chadi, 2016) **[some
scholars simply refer to 'anti-immigration parties']{.underline}** (Van
der Brug et al., 2005). This label however does not suit PRR parties and
movements in Eastern Europe very well, since they are more rooted in
territorial revisionism and perceived threats from ethnic minorities,
such as the Roma (Bustikova and Kitschelt, 2009; Minkenberg, 2017).
Compared with Western Europe, the link between anti-immigration
attitudes and PRR voting is significantly weaker in post-communist
Europe (Allen, 2017). According to Mudde's (2007) influential
definition, two additional features characterize the PRR family:
populism and authoritarianism. [PRR groups share their populist,
anti-establishment rhetoric]{.underline} (Carter, 2005; Ivarsflaten,
2008; Pelinka, 2013). [Populism is a communication style or 'thin'
ideology that adds a second division between 'us' and
'them']{.underline}: it pits the 'pure people' against the untrustworthy
'corrupt elite' (Mudde, 2007). Second, [authoritarianism implies
stressing themes like law and order and traditional values]{.underline}.
Relatedly, [PRR groups favour strong leaders who reflect 'the will of
the people']{.underline} (Inglehart and Norris, 2016). However, there
seems no consistent empirical relationship between authoritarian
attitudes and PRR party preference in Western Europe (Dunn, 2015).
Traits such as conformism or submission to traditional authority are
also at odds with the picture painted of far-right social movement
activists (Klandermans and Mayer, 2006). As a matter of fact, PRR
movements often challenge existing authority (Hirsch-Hoefler and Mudde,
2013). In a nutshell, substantial progress has been made in three
respects. First, scholars have diverted their attention away from
trivializing definitional debates about what right-wing radicalism or
populism really 'is'. Instead, they have increasingly focused on more
informative discussions about theories and hypotheses. Second, scholars
increasingly focus on actually measuring the ideological characteristics
and policy stances of both PRR and mainstream parties (Eger and Valdez,
2015; Immerzeel et al., 2016; Rooduijn and Pauwels, 2011). As a
corollary, most scholars have abandoned reasoning in clear-cut
categories. A strict 'either--or' logic (Mudde, 2007; Van Kessel, 2015)
has been replaced by the argument that populism is more a 'matter of
degree' (Pauwels, 2011a). Likewise, parties can position themselves
somewhere on the left--right or cosmopolitan--nativist dimension
(Akkerman et al., 2016; Van Spanje, 2011a). Nevertheless, for many
research questions requiring case selection it is still necessary to
delineate which ones deserve the label PRR and which ones not. Relying
on expert surveys, Van Spanje (2011a) for instance qualifies parties
that score higher than 8 on a 10-point left--right scale (it is unclear
what a position on this scale exactly signifies) and an immigration
restriction scale as 'far right' and 'anti-immigration', respectively.
Inglehart and Norris (2016) use a similar method with a cultural
position scale, which includes promoting traditional values,
nationalism, law and order, and opposition to multiculturalism. Van
Spanje (2011a: 295) noted that, despite conceptual unclarity, 'every
researcher seems to know which objects to study'. This however seems
less obvious when we study post-communist Europe. Until recently,
scholars have often ignored this region (Minkenberg, 2015, 2017; Pirro,
2015; Pytlas, 2016). Due to its more fluid party systems, it is
generally more difficult to distinguish the political establishment from
(populist) outsiders challenging it (Van Kessel, 2015). Mainstream
parties and discourses are often more radicalized than in Western Europe
(Minkenberg, 2017). Particularly Law and Justice (PiS) in Poland and
Fidesz in Hungary illustrate this difficulty. Minkenberg (2017: 124)
considers them 'right-wing populist with programmatic elements of
radical right', since they remain ideologically more diverse than the
PRR family. Nevertheless, these two parties feature prominently in
debates about liberal democracy being undermined by right-wing populism.
Expert surveys show that PiS and Fidesz have more radical positions than
some Western European PRR parties (Inglehart and Norris, 2016). Go to:
Explanations for failures and successes: Demand- and supply-side
approaches Explanations for the rise and fortunes of PRR parties and
movements are usually grouped into two approaches, demand-side and
supply-side: one focusing on grievances and one on political constraints
and opportunities (Koopmans et al., 2005; Mudde, 2007; Rydgren, 2007).
These two approaches should be viewed as complementary, rather than
competing theories (Van der Brug and Fennema, 2007). Supply-side factors
can be further divided into internal factors (De Lange and Art, 2011;
Norris, 2005), like organizational characteristics (Art, 2011; De Witte
and Klandermans, 2000), and external factors, such as institutional
frameworks and elite responses (Arzheimer and Carter, 2006; Kitschelt
and McGann, 1995). The socio-demographic characteristics and attitudes
of radical right supporters have been extensively investigated
(Arzheimer, 2012; Golder, 2016; Van der Brug and Fennema, 2007). More
recent studies also include Eastern European countries (Allen, 2017;
Inglehart and Norris, 2016; Werts et al., 2013). The findings can be
summarized into two general claims. First, [protest is]{.underline} not
'unideological', but [clearly directed against policies concerning
immigration, integration and law and order]{.underline} (Eatwell, 2000;
Swyngedouw, 2001). [Voting for PRR parties seems largely motivated by
ideological and pragmatic considerations]{.underline}, just like voting
for other parties (Van der Brug et al., 2000). [These motivations stem
from perceived loss of culture and economic deprivation, although
citizens perhaps do not clearly distinguish between cultural and
economic grievances]{.underline} (Golder, 2016). Moreover,
characteristics of followers might differ across contexts. For instance,
lower-educated people are generally the 'usual suspects', but the
constituency of Jobbik certainly does not consist of the 'losers' of the
transition: the young and higher educated are more likely to support
this party (Kovács, 2013). Alternatively, voters for PRR parties are
sometimes characterized as irrational and alienated, seemingly
unconnected to any particular values or policy preferences. However,
social isolation is not related to PRR voting, either in Western or
Eastern Europe (Rydgren, 2011; Zhirkov, 2014). In a similar vein,
Klandermans and Mayer (2006: 267) conclude that [radical right activists
are socially integrated]{.underline} and appear as 'perfectly normal
people' (cf. Blee and Creasap, 2010: 271). Second, it has become clear
that a complete and satisfying explanation for PRR popularity needs to
go beyond the demand-side model. It fails to explain short-term
fluctuations within countries or large differences between otherwise
mostly similar countries (Coffé, 2005; Norris, 2005). For instance,
Austria, where the FPÖ has enjoyed considerable successes, is hardly
more deprived than Germany, where the PRR is weak. Similarly, comparing
the divergent fortunes of the Walloon Front National and Flemish VB, it
is hard to imagine that immigration and unemployment have created
significantly larger electoral demands for the radical right in Flanders
compared to the Walloon region (Arzheimer, 2012).

in light of Xi Jinping's visit to Europe ended up being repurposed to
deal with Theresa May's request for more time to get parliamentary
approval for the negotiated terms of divorce and avoid a chaotic crash
out of the EU on March 29. Worse, the U.K.'s internal divisions are
unlikely to be soothed by the outcome of the coming weeks. Years from
now, the contours of EU relations with Britain on trade, regulations,
and citizen's rights will still cause headaches for Europe. If London's
debacle has deterred other Euroskeptic governments from trying to exit
the EU, nationalists' attempts to transform the EU from the inside
promises to frustrate further European integration. Nationalist parties
such as Fidesz in Hungary, Law and Justice in Poland, and Lega in Italy
-- which promote the idea of an alliance of nation-states hostile to
Muslims and liberal cosmopolitanism -- constitute a front of opposition
to European solutions behind which other governments, with reluctant
publics, can hide. In such an environment, French President Emmanuel
Macron's call for a [European

**[What is the European Union]{.underline}**? The closest concept I can
come up with is that of **[a liberal empire]{.underline}**. An empire is
a hierarchically structured block of states held together by a gradient
of power from a centre to a periphery. At the centre of the EU is
Germany, trying more or less successfully to hide inside a "Core Europe"
(Kerneuropa) formed together with France. Germany doesn't want to be
seen as what the British used to call a Continental Unifier, even if in
fact this is what it is. That it likes to hide behind France is a source
of power for France vis-a-vis Germany. Like other imperial countries,
most recently the United States, **[Germany conceives of
itself]{.underline}**, and wants others to do the same, **[as a
benevolent hegemon doing nothing else than spreading universal common
sense and moral virtues to its neighbours]{.underline}**, at a cost to
itself that is, however, worth bearing for the sake of humanity. In the
German-cum-European case, **[the "values" that are to give
legitimacy]{.underline}** to empire **[are those of]{.underline}**
liberal democracy, constitutional government and individual liberty, in
short, the values of **[political liberalism]{.underline}**. Wrapped
into them, to be displayed when expedient, are free markets and free
competition, i.e., economic liberalism. Determining the exact
composition and the deeper meaning of the imperial value package and how
it is to be applied in specific situations is a prerogative of the
hegemonic centre -- enabling it to extract a sort of political
seigniorage from its periphery in return for its benevolence.
**[Preserving imperial asymmetries requires complicated political and
institutional arrangements. Non-hegemonic member states must be ruled by
elites that consider the center with its particular structures and
values as a model for their own country to emulate]{.underline}** -- or
in any case they must be willing to organize their internal social,
political and economic order so as to make it compatible with the
interests of the center in holding its empire together. **[Keeping such
elites in power is essential for empire to last]{.underline}**; as the
American experience teaches us, this may come with costs in terms of
democratic values, economic resources, and even human lives. Sometimes
**[ruling elites of small or backward countries seek subaltern
membership in an empire, hoping for support from the imperial leadership
in pushing through domestic "modernization" projects, against a
citizenry that may not be enthusiastic about them]{.underline}**.
Welcoming their allegiance to its cause, **[the empire will help them
stay in power, by endowing them with ideological, monetary and military
means to keep oppositional parties at bay]{.underline}**. In a liberal
empire that is supposed to be kept together by moral values rather than
military violence, how this is to be done is not necessarily
straightforward. Mistakes can be made, on the part of the imperial
center as well as of peripheral ruling classes, who may both overplay
their hands. For example, Germany and France together, in spite of more
or less surreptitious help from the European Central Bank, failed to
keep the Renzi "reform" government in Italy in power against popular
resistance. Similarly, Germany is right now turning out to be unable to
protect the Macron presidency from the "Yellow Vests" and other
opponents to his program of economic Germanification. Domestic
difficulties are also faced by the hegemonic country itself. Under
liberal imperialism its government must be careful to make its pursuit
of its country's national interests, or what it considers these to be,
appear to be advancing the general progress of liberal values, from
democracy to prosperity for all. In this it may require the assistance
of its client countries. This failed to be forthcoming when in 2015 the
Merkel government tried to resolve the German demographic and
reputational crisis by substituting unregulated asylum for regulated
immigration, which it had long been unable to get the Christian
Democratic Party (CDU/CSU) to legislate. Opening the German borders
under the pretense that borders could no longer be policed in the
twenty-first century, or alternatively that open borders were demanded
by international law, required that the European Union as a whole
followed suit. No member country did so, however -- some, like France,
keeping silent about it, others, like Hungary and Poland, insisting
publicly on their national sovereignty. As they broke, for domestic
reasons, with the liberal-imperial understanding never to embarrass a
fellow government, in particular that of the hegemon, they inflicted a
domestic problem on Merkel from which she never recovered. The event
also produced a lasting line of cleavage in the internal-international
politics of the empire, between the Center and the East, dividing
"Europe" further by adding to its existing divisions, in the West with
the United Kingdom and in the South along its Mediterranean fault line
(which became critical with the introduction of the common currency).
Even less than other forms of empire, **[a liberal empire is never in a
settled equilibrium]{.underline}**. Rather than a stable state, **[it is
permanently under pressure, from below as well as from its sides.
Lacking the capacity for military intervention, it cannot in particular
use military power to prevent countries exiting from it.]{.underline}**
When the United Kingdom decided to leave the European Union, Germany and
France never considered invading the British Isles to keep them in
"Europe"; so far the EU is indeed a force of peace. From a German
perspective, however, an amicable British departure might have
undermined imperial discipline, as other countries unsatisfied with the
imperial regime might have considered leaving as well. Even worse, if a
British exit would have been prevented by meaningful "European"
concessions in exchange for staying, other countries might have asked
for renegotiation of an acquis communautaire deliberately written to be
forever non-negotiable. So the choice for Britain had to be between
remaining without concessions -- the Canossa solution -- and leaving at
very high cost to itself. On the other hand, Britain had in many cases
helped Germany escape from an all-too-tight French embrace, balancing
French statism with a, for Germany, healthy commitment to free markets.
With a British exit, that balance would be lost. France knowing this, it
obviously insisted on tough negotiations, with the hidden, or
not-so-hidden, agenda to make the British stick to their decision to
leave. Taking advantage of German concerns over imperial discipline,
France apparently got its way in spite of rivalling German concerns over
having to cope with French ambitions in the absence of British support.
It remains to be seen whether giving in to France was another
short-sighted short-term opportunistic Merkel-style decision that will
cost Germany dearly in coming years. As to the UK, to the extent that
its decision to leave was driven by nationalist as distinguished from
either pro- or anti-socialist concerns, it may amount to a historical
mistake. Brexit leaves France as the only nuclear power in the EU, and
the only one with a permanent Security Council seat to boot. German
objections to French leadership ambitions in a more tightly integrated
EU drawing on German economic strength will now find less weighty
support among the remaining membership. With Britain outside, France may
hope to become the European unifier, trying to pressure Germany into a
French-style European state project ("a sovereign France in a sovereign
Europe" -- Macron). Blocking such a development from the outside may
turn out to be more difficult than sabotaging it from within. Remember
how hard de Gaulle tried to keep the United Kingdom out of what was then
the European Economic Community, arguing that Britain was not "European"
enough. **[Governance of an empire is inevitably also driven by
geostrategic in addition to economic and ideological
concerns]{.underline}**, in particular on the empire's territorial
margins. **[Stabilizing border states on the extreme periphery is needed
not just for economic expansion]{.underline}**, although this is
essential for an empire with a capitalist economy. Where an empire
borders at another empire, expansionist or not, it tends to be willing
to pay an even higher price for keeping cooperative national governments
in or kicking uncooperative ones out. **[National elites that can
threaten to break away and change sides should be able to extract more
expensive concessions]{.underline}**, even if their internal politics
are quite unsavoury -- viz. countries like Serbia or Rumania. Here,
finally, military power comes in, as distinguished from the "soft power"
of "values". While a liberal empire would find it hard to use force on a
wayward populace, it may protect friendly governments by enabling them
to adopt a hostile nationalist posture toward a neighbouring country
that feels threatened by the advancing empire; or it may provide cover
if countries chose to adopt such posture. In return for this, a
hegemonic power may get concessions, for example in the form of support
on issues contested among member states. Viz. the Baltic States keeping
silent on the admission and allocation of refugees in exchange for
Germany building up its military and deploying it so that it threatens
Russia. Countries and their citizens at the centre of a liberal empire
may hope to **[rule without recourse to military power]{.underline}**.
But **[ultimately]{.underline}** this **[is an illusion; there cannot be
hegemony without guns]{.underline}**. It is in this context that the
**[falling-in-line]{.underline}** of the Merkel government with American
and NATO **[demands for a near-doubling of German military
expenditure]{.underline}** to two per cent of GDP must be seen. Its real
significance is not related to NATO but to the EU. It the two per cent
goal was actually attained, Germany alone would be spending more than 40
per cent more on arms than Russia, and all of that spending would be on
conventional weapons. Probably **[this would contribute to keeping
countries like the Baltic States and Poland in the European Union
flock]{.underline}**, making it less attractive for them to place their
bets on the United States instead. While **[it might enable Germany to
get Eastern European EU member states to]{.underline}** give up or
**[moderate their opposition on "value" issues]{.underline}**, such as
refugees or "marriage for all", **[it would also]{.underline}**,
unfortunately, **[give Russia good reasons to upgrade its nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}** (as Russia is doing right now) **[and encourage
countries like Ukraine to take a more provocative stance toward
Russia]{.underline}**. France, which already spends the magic two per
cent on its military, might hope for a doubling of German military
spending detracting from German economic prowess (although it is
apparently also hoping for French-German cooperation in arms production
and exports). More importantly, in a European army, as demanded by
Macron and supported by German European integrationists, including the
philosopher Jürgen Habermas, the significant increase in German
conventional capabilities that the two per cent would buy would
compensate for the French weakness on ground troops, due to a
disproportionate share of French military spending having to be devoted
to the Force de frappe -- an instrument that cannot easily be deployed
against Islamist militants in West Africa trying to interrupt French
access to uranium and rare earths. **[Filling the position of hegemon in
a liberal empire is far from easy]{.underline}**, and in fact, it is
becoming increasingly clear that **[Germany will not for long be able to
do so]{.underline}**. This is not only because **[overextension has
always been a deadly temptation for empires]{.underline}**, as last
exemplified by both the Soviet Union and the United States. **[As to
Germany in particular, the popular mood there is still essentially
pacifist, and the constitutional prerogative]{.underline}** of the
German parliament to **[regulate even small details on the deployment of
German troops]{.underline}** will not be given up. Whether Germany
post-Merkel will actually be able and willing to deliver on the two per
cent is an open question. **[There will also be a need for imperial side
payments to the Mediterranean countries that suffer under the German
hard-currency regime, and for "structural funds" supporting the Eastern
European states and their "pro-European" political class]{.underline}**.
With France suffering from low growth and high deficits, it is only
Germany that will be asked to chip in, the required order of magnitude
easily exceeding its abilities. Note also that what since the refugee
episode of 2015 has become the biggest opposition party, the AfD, while
nationalist, is so only in the sense of isolationist and
anti-imperialist -- and is, strangely enough, for this reason, branded
by German liberal imperialists as "anti-European". With benevolent
reading, leaving aside for a moment the party's disgusting fits of
historical revisionism, AfD nationalism amounts to unwillingness to pay
for empire, with corresponding willingness to allow other countries to
do their own thing; see the party's strong belief in appeasement instead
of confrontation in relation to Russia, a belief it shares with the left
wing of the Linkspartei

cats, it's Brexit,\" Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/21/capitalism-fat-cats-brexit-leaving-eu

Remainers on the left would argue that there is no need to leave the EU
for this to happen, but they are wrong about that for two reasons.
**[The first is that a radical socialist programme that included a
different approach to state aid, state ownership]{.underline}**, public
procurement **[and managed trade would be deemed illegal under European
law. The second is that without Brexit, the impetus for change would
quickly dissipate.]{.underline}** So what, say remainers. The status quo
is better than Brexit, the baleful consequences of which are already
clear from the slowdown in the economy and warnings from banks and
transnational firms that they will move at least some of their
operations out of the UK unless they get the sort of deal they want.
**[But the left needs to be very careful about running with the idea
that business should be able to veto decisions made by the electorate.
If Labour had won the recent election, Corbyn would have had a mandate
for extensive nationalisation, ending austerity and higher taxation on
companies]{.underline}** and the well-off. Big business would certainly
have cut up rough about all that. There would have been warnings from
the Confederation of British Industry about its members moving thousands
of jobs out of the country. Would those calling for a second EU
referendum be calling for another general election so voters could think
again about supporting such a dangerously radical policy? Probably not.
Nor, given that Britain has been through the decade from hell, is the
idea of a return to the status quo especially attractive. **[The four
freedoms of the single market have made it easier for companies to move
money, goods, services and people around the EU, but workers have not
benefited. There has been virtually no growth in UK [per-capita
incomes](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/07/falling-real-pay-shows-the-british-economy-is-still-struggling)
since the start of the financial crisis in 2007,]{.underline}**
something that has not happened outside wartime in the modern age.
**[Britain is a low-wage economy with a chronic balance of payments
problem]{.underline}**. Repeated bouts of de-industrialisation mean
there has not been a surplus on manufactured goods [since the early
1980s](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/31/a-vulnerable-economy-the-true-cost-of-britains-current-account-deficit).
Growth has become ever more dependent on consumers' appetite for debt,
and the willingness of the Bank of England to make servicing that
borrowing as cheap as possible. The UK's poorer regions are 20 years
behind the south-east in terms of living standards. These problems are
not new. They were there long before David Cameron decided to hold an EU
referendum, and they will be there regardless of whether Brexit happens
or not. Remainers on the left have spent the past year bemoaning the
referendum result and have expended a great deal of intellectual energy
thinking up ways to hold a second referendum or, failing that, to come
up with a Brexit that in effect returns Britain to where it was on 22
June 2016. They have quite legitimately asked leavers to explain what
Britain will look like after leaving the EU. But they have come up with
no solutions themselves for sorting out the country's long-term economic
problems. The assumption seems to be that all will be well provided
Britain's supply chains are protected by continued membership of the
single market, and the City retains its role as Europe's premier
financial centre. This is sheer fantasy. **[If membership of the single
market were a panacea, Britain would not have the [weakest investment
record](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/31/uk-comes-bottom-of-the-g7-growth-league-as-canada-takes-the-lead)
of any G7 country. Nor would it be running such a big trade deficit.
Capitalism's ability to see off its rivals has always been based on the
notion that it will make people better off]{.underline}**, even if some
people benefit more than others. But that pledge has been broken.
Historically, **[profound political change only happens at times of
crisis. Without the Great Depression and the second world war, there
would have been no Labour landslide in 1945]{.underline}**. Without the
crisis of the mid-1970s, there would have been no Thatcherism.
**[Without the

be a backbencher. As it is, **[Labour is now led by somebody who spent
years in the political wilderness with a simple message: that there was
something inherently rotten about modern capitalism; that there were
radical solutions to that malaise; and that Europe was part of the
problem, rather than part of the solution]{.underline}**.

free-world coalition, perhaps in concert with some of that coalition's
most dangerous enemies.]{.underline} Yet there are also a number of
deeper structural issues threatening to pull the alliance apart. [[It
would be comforting to think]{.mark} that [NATO will simply surmount
this crisis]{.mark} as it has surmounted others, but [that might well be
**Pollyannaish** given the nature, severity, and **multiplicity of the
problems**]{.mark} it confronts today]{.underline}. For starters, [while
the complaints being exchanged across the Atlantic are familiar, they
actually have more merit now than at any previous time. From the U.S.
perspective, burden-sharing has reached an unprecedented
crisis]{.underline} when a country as wealthy as Germany contributes so
little real military power relevant to the alliance's collective defense
mission---and bridles at suggestions it ought to spend more than 1.5
percent of GDP on defense. Nor is this simply a German problem. In 2017,
the RAND Corporation assessed that America's three most powerful
European allies---France, Germany, and the United Kingdom---would each
struggle to generate and sustain a single brigade for alliance
operations in Eastern Europe. [[This relates to another factor that is
different]{.mark} this time around: [the **lack of even a minimal
presidential commitment** to Atlanticism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Previous
intra-alliance disputes had the feel of a family fight]{.underline},
where everyone had a shared identity if not a shared perspective. Even
presidents whose behavior greatly concerned many Europeans---Ronald
Reagan in the early 1980s, George W. Bush after 9/11---valued or came to
value the special bonds between America and NATO. What scares the
Europeans most about President Trump may be that he wants no part of
that family identity. He seems genuinely to believe that allies are more
trouble than they are worth, and he seems especially to detest
Atlanticism. Just as bad, he seems to believe that allies (apart from
Israel) merit no better treatment than committed American adversaries.
[[If the American president does]{.mark} indeed [believe]{.mark} that
[there is no "**special relationship**]{.mark}" with the Atlantic
allies, if he is truly determined to treat them no better, and perhaps
worse, than any other country, then [that]{.mark} truly [is
**unprecedented**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Equally unprecedented is the
president's open antipathy for Article 5]{.underline}. To be clear,
Americans have always had doubts about fighting a war---particularly a
nuclear war---to defend the allies. After the Vietnam War, only 36
percent of Americans believed that "it was important for the United
States to make and keep commitments to other nations." Yet [U.S.
[presidents have traditionally seen it as their role]{.mark} to reassure
the Europeans that the superpower would nonetheless come riding to the
rescue---[to act as the **calcium in NATO's
backbone**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Trump]{.mark}, however, [is
playing]{.mark} precisely [the opposite role]{.mark}]{.underline}**, by
repeatedly casting doubt on whether Washington would or should intervene
to defend its allies, and by warning that doing so could lead to "World
War III." These comments are having an effect: [Observers in Poland and
elsewhere are openly doubting whether Article 5 remains credible. If the
American president continues to act as the chief doubter]{.underline},
rather than the chief defender, [of NATO's collective security bargain,
then [the alliance]{.mark} [could become a **dead letter**]{.mark} [in
the eyes of its **members and**]{.mark} **its [opponents]{.mark}** alike
**[even without any explicit crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Trump's
persistent questioning of Article 5 also points to another factor that
is different today: This [president]{.mark} [seems]{.mark} uniquely
[resistant to the forces of tradition]{.mark}, conventional [wisdom,
and]{.mark} on-the-job [learning that have helped reconsolidate the
alliance]{.mark} in times of strain]{.underline}. The George W. Bush
administration occasionally deprecated the value of NATO during the
early stages of the global war on terror (and earlier), but the
president eventually came to depend on the alliance in dealing with
Afghanistan, Iran, and other matters. President Obama was not a
committed Atlanticist when he took office; he downgraded relations with
the United Kingdom and styled himself the "first Pacific president." But
as Obama was exposed to the enduring logic of the alliance and came to
appreciate its critical role in advancing American priorities, his
reliance on NATO also increased. [Trump]{.underline}, however[, takes
particular pleasure in bucking tradition and rejecting inherited
insights]{.underline}. [More broadly, his foreign policy is becoming
more abrasive and disruptive as his presidency unfolds]{.underline}. If
one of the reasons NATO has endured is that even American presidents who
were initially skeptical of its value have gradually reverted to the
mean, then [Trump's aversion to reversion bodes ill indeed.]{.underline}
In fact, [Trump's distinctive traits are undercutting aspects of the
institutional cooperation that observers have come to expect from NATO.
There is little disagreement within the alliance that Russian
information warfare and electoral meddling constitute severe threats,
but Trump's refusal to take that issue seriously has made the matter far
more difficult to address]{.underline}. Likewise, there is an emerging
sense in many European capitals that China's unfair trade practices
demand a coordinated response. Yet the fact that Trump has chosen to
launch a trade war against Europe has made such coordination impossible.
[NATO may be a uniquely institutionalized alliance, but [sustained
cooperation]{.mark} on the most sensitive issues **still
[requires]{.mark} some degree of [political consensus]{.mark}**---and
today, that consensus appears wanting]{.underline}.

### Liberal order resilient

#### Liberal order is resilient, their punditry overlooks mutual interests

**Weisbrot 8-27**-2018 - co-director of the Center for Economic and
Policy Research in Washington, DC, and president of Just Foreign Policy
(Mark, "The Transatlantic Alliance Will Survive Trump," *The Nation*,
<https://www.thenation.com/article/the-transatlantic-alliance-will-survive-trump/>)

Every week, often [more than once a week, there's another article in the
major media or in foreign-policy publications about the demise of
the]{.underline} post--World War II Anglo-American [world order. These
analyses typically single out the transatlantic alliance]{.underline}
between the United States and Europe―two of the world's largest
economies―[for special concern and anxiety as the underpinning of this
world order]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, President [Trump's wildly
fluctuating comments on NATO]{.underline} (despite the fact that he is
expanding it), [his unprecedented rudeness to European leaders, and his
friendliness with Vladimir Putin at the Helsinki summit have all added
to the angst.]{.underline} [The basic story behind this moaning and
melancholy is that US leaders put together a "rules-based" system based
on "open markets" and democracy]{.underline} (the two are sometimes seen
as synonymous) [that has fostered prosperity and relative
stability]{.underline}. The United States was the only sizable
industrial economy to emerge not only unscathed but doubled in size
following the war. While others might have taken advantage of this
unrivaled power for their own gain, the story goes, America's beneficent
rulers constructed a world order for the good of everyone. Trump is seen
as a threat to its continued existence. This assessment of the postwar
world order leaves out some 3 million dead Vietnamese and half a million
dead in Indonesia, who might question the beneficence of this system if
it had not killed them. A million dead Iraqis, if they could be heard,
would probably also raise objections about whether US dominance has been
in the interests of all. And there are hundreds of millions of people in
Latin America, Africa, and other parts of Asia who suffered for decades
under US-backed dictatorships, as well as US-sponsored wars. Much of the
violent dysfunctionality in these countries today is a direct result of
these interventions, as well as continuing US influence. In fact, as I
write this now, the US military is directly involved in a war that has
deliberately produced what the UN has called the worst humanitarian
crisis in the world, in Yemen. That war has pushed more than 8 million
people to the brink of starvation, created the worst outbreak of cholera
in modern history, and killed thousands of civilians in bombing raids.
Washington is providing midair refueling to the Saudi and UAE bombers,
intelligence, targeting assistance, on-the-ground military personnel,
and more―constrained only by growing opposition in Congress. But let us
ignore these inconvenient truths for a moment, as almost all of these
analyses do, and look at the present situation. In fact, **[the
transatlantic alliance is much stronger than most of these analysts
recognize]{.underline}**. [This is mainly because it is not just an
alliance of democratic governments with shared values, but also one of
the rich countries of the world―their ruling elites, that is―against the
poor and middle-income countries of the world]{.underline}. The rules of
the World Trade Organization, to which 164 countries are bound, were
written by US and European corporations. The WTO's most significant
achievement since its creation in 1995 was to increase US-style patent
protection throughout the world, leading to the death of millions of
poor people who cannot get access to essential medicines. After years of
struggle, some of these rules were rewritten, but much damage remains.
The WTO's rules on agriculture also greatly disadvantage developing
countries and seek to prohibit governments from subsidizing domestic
production for domestic consumption to feed people who are badly
malnourished, for example in India. WTO rules also make it much more
difficult for developing countries to employ the industrial policies
that high-income countries like the United States used to get where they
are today. The International Monetary Fund, an organization that has 189
member countries, is run by the United States and Europe. In fact, for
most of the world outside of Europe, the US Treasury Department is in
charge. The World Bank, which by custom since 1946 has to have an
American as its president, is also controlled by Washington and its
allies, and cooperates with the IMF in promoting and imposing economic
policies that Washington favors. These policies are often not in the
interest of developing countries, as one would expect from organizations
that are not accountable to low- and middle-income countries, or to any
electorate. These are the institutions of global governance that
exercise power in the world, other than the UN Security Council, where
the transatlantic alliance must share veto power with Russia and China.
The IMF, for most of the past half-century, has been the most important
avenue of US influence over low- and middle-income countries. It has sat
at the top of a creditors' cartel, where countries that did not agree to
IMF conditions would not get loans from other multilateral lenders
(e.g., the World Bank) and sometimes not even from the private sector.
This cartel lost influence in most middle-income countries in the first
decade of the 21st century, but it has been coming back (e.g., in
Argentina), and it still maintains its creditors' cartel in poor
countries. [European leaders are quite angry]{.underline} about the
Trump administration's unilateral abrogation of the Joint Comprehensive
Plan of Action, the negotiated agreement with Iran that had put an end
to the threat that it would develop nuclear weapons in the foreseeable
future. Europe clearly has much more of a security risk stemming from
Middle East turmoil, which is worsened by Trump's threatened war with
Iran; not to mention all the political problems that have been created
by the refugee inflow that was primarily a result of US intervention
there. [But what did they do about it]{.underline}, after their anxious
pleading with Trump failed to move him? **[Nothing]{.underline}**,
**[because these leaders]{.underline}**―quite apart from the people of
Europe, who have been screwed royally since the Great Recession―**[need
their beloved partner in crime]{.underline}**. The United States is the
gendarme of the rich countries' global economic and political order.
This is partly because Washington did not suffer the destruction that
Europe did in the world wars, and partly because Europeans have
developed welfare states that do not allow for the fantastically
wasteful military spending that maintains 800 US military bases around
the globe. But Washington's weapons of mass and ordinary destruction are
by no means its whole arsenal. The "exorbitant privilege" of being able
to print the world's most important currency, which makes up 60 percent
of global reserves held by central banks, is another. When Lehman
Brothers collapsed in 2008 and the world financial crisis hit, the
Federal Reserve arranged currency swaps for its European partners to
make sure they didn't suffer any temporary international liquidity
problems. On the other side of the divide, if you are outside
Washington's good graces, the dollarized world financial system allows
the United States vast power to enforce sanctions against you (e.g., in
the cases of Cuba, Venezuela, and Iran), whether or not the UN approves.
[Europe's elites are bound to the rulers of the United States by virtue
of their common interest in maintaining dominance over the world
economy]{.underline}. This is true despite the fact that their spoils do
not trickle down to the citizenry. This transatlantic dominance won't
last forever. Eurasia, the world's largest land mass, which bred the
colonial powers that conquered the world, continues to increase its
economic integration, despite Washington's efforts to counter this
world-historical trend with its attempted TPP and TTIP commercial
agreements. China's economy is already 25 percent larger than that of
the United States on a purchasing-power-parity basis (this is the
measure most often used by economists for international comparisons,
since it takes into account price differences between countries). In a
decade, it's projected to be about twice as big as that of the United
States. Over time, European countries, led by their corporations and
financial institutions, will look more to the East and less to the West
as the world becomes more multipolar and the US share of the world
economy shrinks. But [for the near future, the US and European elite
need each other as the global hegemon tries to hang on to its unelected
position. Trump can be as rude, crude, and ignorant as he pleases with
his European allies, but it **won't make them rebel against the "leader
of the free world**."]{.underline}

### NATO resilient

#### NATO is resilient\-\--history and shared interests

**Brands 8-15**-2018 - teaches at Johns Hopkins-SAIS and is a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments with Peter
Feaver, professor of political science and public policy at Duke
University, where he directs the American Grand Strategy program and the
Triangle Institute for Security Studies (Hal, w/ Feaver, "Trump's
Transatlantic Crisis," *Commentary Magazine*,
<https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/trumps-transatlantic-crisis/>)

[The particular issues that have divided NATO have changed over time,
but one constant has been recurring crises that seemingly threaten to
break up the alliance]{.underline}. [This pattern has owed much to
personality clashes between the likes of LBJ and de Gaulle, Helmut
Schmidt and Jimmy Carter, and]{.underline} George W. [Bush
and]{.underline} Jacques [Chirac]{.underline}, [as well as all the other
idiosyncrasies that influence statecraft]{.underline}. Yet more
fundamentally, it reflects structural imbalances at the heart of the
alliance---imbalances of power, geography, and political culture. NATO
must bridge a power gap greater than those that any other alliance in
modern history has faced. It contains the mightiest state in the world
(the United States) as well as some of the smallest and weakest
(Luxembourg and the Baltics). It contains enormously wealthy nations
(America and the northern European states) as well as nations with high
poverty levels and deep fiscal woes (Bulgaria, Turkey, and Greece). It
encompasses states enjoying the geopolitical blessing of defensible
borders far from historical enemies, as well as states that have been
veritable highways for invasion and conquest. More recently, it has
included states that perceive an intense security threat from Russia in
the east as well as those whose most serious security threats come from
jihadists, migrants, and other challenges out of NATO's south. [For most
of its history, the alliance has included both dictators and
democrats]{.underline}, [not to mention stable parliamentary and
presidential systems as well as countries trapped in a never-ending
cycle of short-lived coalition governments]{.underline}. Its members
have consisted of colonial masters seeking to hold on to decaying
empires, and also a hegemon that has long defined itself as an
anti-colonial power even as it has built a vast informal "empire" of its
own. [These deep differences have given rise to enduring conflicts
across]{.underline} an array of diplomatic, military, and economic
issues; those conflicts have periodically triggered intra-alliance
crises that are invariably described in breathless tones. **[Yet the
flip side of recurring crises is recurring recoveries.]{.underline}**
[Even if there are differences of strategic perspective, at bottom there
has been a shared threat that gives the alliance
cohesion]{.underline}---whether [Soviet]{.underline} expansionism, the
economic travails of [capitalism]{.underline}, [the spread of weapons of
mass destruction]{.underline} to rogue actors, [or terrorist
networks]{.underline} seeking to trigger a religious war. [As time
passed, the alliance also benefited from a deep institutionalization
that promoted routinized collaboration and insulated the relationship
from the political disputes that erupted every few years]{.underline}.
[On top of all of this, the alliance benefited from
inertia]{.underline}. [The longer it went on, the more it seemed
destined to go on, because none of the members could imagine what it
would be like to live in a world without NATO]{.underline}. **[Finally,
the alliance showed a remarkable degree of adaptability]{.underline}**.
It managed the transition from an American nuclear monopoly to a
configuration of nuclear haves and have-nots. It navigated the shift
from an era of American economic dominance and European economic
destitution to one of deep economic integration and even rivalry. The
alliance pivoted from periods of intense hostility with Moscow during
the 1950s and early 1960s, to a period of negotiation and détente in the
1970s, and back again to hostility during the late 1970s and 1980s; it
subsequently shifted from confronting the Warsaw Pact to absorbing its
former members. NATO needed to change to survive in a fluid world, and
it generally succeeded in doing so. **[These underlying strengths were
mutually reinforcing and compensating]{.underline}**. [When one was
challenged, the power of the others could make up for the resulting
vulnerability.]{.underline} Some
**[i]{.underline}**nternational-**[r]{.underline}**elations [theorists
missed this fact when they predicted that the Soviet collapse would
cause the collapse of the alliance]{.underline}. On [the contrary, the
alliance adapted and in some ways deepened, leading ultimately to its
expansion and the undertaking of sustained, out-of-area military
missions that few]{.underline} of the post--World War II [founders could
have anticipated. In sum, the nearly seven-decade history of the
alliance is one of a structure **continually bending but never
breaking**]{.underline}.

#### NATO is resilient and will withstand Trump

**Brands 8-15**-2018 - teaches at Johns Hopkins-SAIS and is a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments with Peter
Feaver, professor of political science and public policy at Duke
University, where he directs the American Grand Strategy program and the
Triangle Institute for Security Studies (Hal, w/ Feaver, "Trump's
Transatlantic Crisis," *Commentary Magazine*,
https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/trumps-transatlantic-crisis/)

Yet [no one does disruption like Donald Trump]{.underline}, and [his
ascendancy has ushered in a new and undeniably rough patch for
transatlantic relations]{.underline}. During the 2016 campaign, Trump
used America's European allies as political punching bags. The pattern
extended into the first months of the presidency, with Trump refusing to
deliver boilerplate endorsements of the importance and inviolability of
the alliance, criticizing longtime friends such as the United Kingdom in
the wake of terrorist attacks on its soil, launching political attacks
on vulnerable leaders such as Merkel, and persistently seeking close
relations with the very country---Vladimir Putin's Russia---that was
threatening the alliance's security. The rest of the Trump
administration tried to cover for the apparent presidential hostility,
urging the allies to ignore the rhetoric and focus instead on policy
substance. This approach initially seemed prudent. Even as Trump
harangued and baited longtime allies on the phone, in one-on-one
meetings, and via Twitter, the Pentagon not only maintained but
increased funding for the European Deterrence Initiative and other
measures to strengthen NATO vis-à-vis Moscow. Leading GOP
internationalists such as Senator John McCain reassured Europeans that
the partnership was as vital as ever. But as Trump's presidency
unfolded, rhetorical conflict led to sharpening conflicts over
substance. In June 2017, Trump announced that Washington would withdraw
from the Paris Agreement on climate change, despite the pleas of
European officials. In early 2018, Trump replaced Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson with Mike Pompeo, and then replaced National Security Adviser
H.R. McMaster with John Bolton. In each case, Trump replaced an
establishment figure who had gone to great lengths to reassure the
allies with men best known for taking strong policy stands diametrically
opposite to European preferences. Policy followed personnel. At the
beginning of May, Trump announced that the United States would withdraw
from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the Iran nuclear deal),
even though the United Kingdom, France, and Germany had spent months
lobbying Trump not to do so and making some efforts to accommodate the
president's critiques of that agreement. Later that month, Trump
launched his long-threatened trade war by announcing punitive tariffs on
steel and aluminum, which hit close NATO allies particularly hard. Then
came the collapse of the G-7 summit, open attacks on German Prime
Minister Merkel, and talk of further escalation of the trade war---all
of which intensified calls within Europe for "resistance" against a
supposedly rogue superpower. In this context, Trump's performance in
Brussels, London, and Helsinki in July 2018---when he again deliberately
picked a fight with NATO, took aim at a wounded friend in need (this
time Theresa May), and then jetted off for a chummy meeting with an
aggressive despot---was shocking but not at all surprising. For good
measure, the president then resumed questioning of NATO's Article 5,
which requires all member nations to come to the defense of any one of
them under actual attack---wondering aloud why the United States should
come to the defense of Montenegro, NATO's newest member, should it come
under military assault. [The occasional diplomatic niceties could no
longer hide what was evident to all: President Trump did not
particularly like or trust his transatlantic partners, and the feelings
were mutual]{.underline}. WHY THIS TIME MAY BE MORE OF THE SAME **[And
yet]{.underline}**, and yet---**[there are several reasons to think that
this, too, may pass]{.underline}**. [For starters, the policy
disputes---as distinct from the rhetoric---have not been as damaging or
as central to the security rationale of the alliance as were some of the
Cold War crises]{.underline}. During the Suez affair, the British and
French launched an ill-fated military conflict against the will of
President Eisenhower, only to suffer the lash of Ike's economic warfare,
which almost bankrupted the Bank of England and essentially destroyed
French and British influence in the Middle East. The damage then to what
London and Paris deemed their vital interests was greater than anything
Trump has yet wrought. Similarly, the debates over the decision to
deploy new ground-launched cruise missiles and intermediate-range
ballistic missiles to Europe during the Carter and Reagan years were so
charged because they touched the very heart of the security guarantee:
how best to extend American power to deter a Soviet attack. Europe cares
about the Iran nuclear deal today, but not nearly as much as it cared
about the stability of extended deterrence and the Soviet--U.S. nuclear
balance. [It is also obvious, and somewhat reassuring, that the chief
complaints on either side are as old as the alliance itself. From the
start, Americans grumbled that their European and Canadian partners were
not doing as much as they could in their own defense.]{.underline}
[Every president since has found reason to remind the allies that
Washington is bearing a disproportionate share of the
burden]{.underline}. In response, Europeans have been voluble in
expressing their concerns about American judgment and dependability.
From the European perspective, this was a major purpose of the
alliance---to "keep the Americans in" lest U.S. policy drift in an
isolationist or irresponsible fashion. [European leaders have long
voiced skepticism about the U.S. commitment to the
alliance]{.underline}---recall the frequently voiced Cold War concern
about whether a president would really trade Boston for Bonn---[while
also complaining about how hard it is to rein in the American cowboy.
All the actors have delivered the same lines in the Trump era, albeit
with unusual passion]{.underline}. [There also remain **powerful
geopolitical shock absorbers** that can limit the disruption Trump
causes, just as the looming Soviet threat ultimately kept the alliance
together during the Cold War]{.underline}. The [Europeans have all the
reason in the world to seek to pacify the American president. From a
cold realpolitik perspective, Europe **simply needs America** more than
the public commentary seems to appreciate]{.underline}. Europe's
internal travails make it clear that [Europeans cannot manage
continental problems, let alone other global and regional challenges,
without U.S. assistance]{.underline}. Similarly, [when it comes to
confronting Putin, Europe has **nowhere else to go**: Without U.S.
support, the Europeans would be utterly incapable of defending the
continent's eastern frontiers]{.underline} from a revanchist Russia if
Putin actually ordered an invasion. Over the longer term, it is possible
to imagine a hegemonic, illiberal China filling any global leadership
void left by a retreating America; it is much harder to imagine that
such a development would actually serve European interests. [No matter
how unhappy the Europeans might be with Trump, they know that the
alternatives to continued cooperation with Washington are
worse]{.underline}. Fortunately, alliance cohesion is not just a matter
of "you can't do better than me"; [there are real security interests
that incentivize continued cooperation]{.underline}. The threats NATO
faces are not as compelling as those faced during the Cold War. But they
are much more compelling than those of the 1990s, when the alliance
struggled to achieve unity in confronting humanitarian crises. Russia is
not merely a failing state with nuclear weapons, as was the case during
the 1990s. Russia is a failing state with nuclear weapons led by a
hyper-nationalist who has slipped the bonds of democratic constraints
and is unfettered as he works through his list of grievances and
indulges his appetite for risk. Iran's apparent nuclear ambitions,
missile programs, and Middle Eastern expansionism threaten U.S. and
European interests; the Islamic State and other jihadist groups have
attacked both U.S. and European targets. Significant differences in
threat perception remain, of course, particularly as one moves from the
states most threatened by Russia in Eastern Europe to those more
insulated from the military threat in the West. The former face a potent
mix of conventional invasion threats, hybrid-warfare threats, and
political warfare in the form of cyber intrusions and electoral
interference. The latter primarily have to worry about cyberattacks and
political meddling. The former group has no choice but to fight if a
NATO--Russia conflict breaks out; if recent polling is any indication,
the latter group may be more hesitant. NATO will thus face continuing
challenges in determining which threats to prioritize and how.
Nonetheless, the rationale for the alliance---that its members can serve
their national interests better through close cooperation on shared
threats---is truer today than at any time since the Soviet collapse.
Finally, [some key sources of the resilience that has sustained NATO
over the years are still there. NATO is as thickly institutionalized as
ever, and just as strong is the inertia of seven decades of muddling
through. That institutionalized cooperation has been evident in
Afghanistan, among other places]{.underline}, where several NATO members
have contributed additional forces to accompany the U.S. "mini-surge"
announced by President Trump in August 2017. [And while political
leaders on both sides of the Atlantic are willing to express their
complaints more openly, the elite consensus on NATO's value appears to
remain **largely** **intact**]{.underline}. [It is telling that
virtually every member of Trump's own national-security team has found
occasion to express the historic bipartisan consensus on the importance
of the alliance, often doing so after a particularly inflammatory Trump
tweet]{.underline}. At the popular level, [opinion polling shows that
Americans think just as highly of NATO as they normally]{.underline}
have. Trump and other true-believing "America Firsters" look at it
differently. Yet most Americans, and [most influential
people]{.underline} who have thought deeply about the issue, [still
adhere to the traditional view: The alliance has benefitted all its
members and is worth preserving]{.underline}.

### NATO AT - Trump

#### Threats from Trump make it more resilient by limiting European criticisms

**Brands 8-15**-2018 - teaches at Johns Hopkins-SAIS and is a senior
fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments with Peter
Feaver, professor of political science and public policy at Duke
University, where he directs the American Grand Strategy program and the
Triangle Institute for Security Studies (Hal, w/ Feaver, "Trump's
Transatlantic Crisis," *Commentary Magazine*,
https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/trumps-transatlantic-crisis/)

So [how do the various strengths and vulnerabilities of the alliance net
out? Is this time really different]{.underline}, or just more of the
same? In the near term, [it remains unlikely that NATO will experience a
fatal or near-fatal rupture, because the underlying logic of the
alliance remains compelling, because it has weathered numerous and
perhaps even worse crises before, and because some key sources of
cohesion persist even amid the current crisis]{.underline}. The most
likely scenario for the next two to three years is that the alliance
will muddle through as it has muddled through before, with American
Atlanticists inside and outside the administration trying to limit the
fallout from Trump's enmity, and Europeans trying to protect their
interests and dignity while nonetheless tempering the urge for a
showdown that could escalate in counterproductive ways. Here **[the
unprecedented role played by Trump may even provide added
resilience]{.underline}**. [When members of the administration and
Trump's own party signal that they understand the importance of allies
even if he does not, they **encourage allies to keep their heads down
and avoid taking steps that would make matters worse**]{.underline}.
Better just to wait for the passing of a septuagenarian one-of-a-kind.

### No Russia war

#### Zero risk of Russian revision, and Europe can defend themselves

Review*,
<https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/21294/nato-is-obsolete-that-doesn-t-mean-it-s-not-valuable>)

[Even with regard to the threat posed by Russia, it is a risk **more of
coercion than conquest**]{.underline}, and is felt most acutely only by
the alliance's easternmost members, namely the Baltic states. Yet, [in
almost every state across Europe, there is also a strong constituency
among the political and business classes in favor of engagement and
cooperation with Moscow]{.underline}. Russia's annexation of Crimea and
its meddling in Ukraine rattled nerves and drove a recommitment to
signaling alliance resolve and solidarity. But Trump's call for a thaw
in relations with Russia finds an echo nearly everywhere, and [the idea
that a workable political solution to the "Russia problem" exists is
part of the mainstream debate in Europe.]{.underline} [In other words,
European alarm over the prospect of U.S. abandonment of NATO comes at a
time when Europe is **safer than it has ever been from the threats the
alliance can counter**]{.underline}.

in any of its global endeavors \-- from dealing with Iran\'s nuclear
program to stopping genocide in Syria \-- it [[no longer]{.mark} sees
the European theater as its core problem or [seeks a partnership]{.mark}
of equals [with Europeans]{.mark}.]{.underline} It was not until the
eurozone looked like it might collapse \-- threatening to bring down the
global economy and with it Obama\'s chances of reelection \-- that the
president became truly interested in Europe.¶ Conversely, [[Europeans
have never cared]{.mark} less [about what the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [thinks]{.mark}. [Germany]{.mark}]{.underline},
traditionally among the most Atlanticist of European countries, [[has
led the pack]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many [German foreign-policy makers
think it was simply a tactical error for Berlin to line up with Moscow
and Beijing against Washington on Libya.]{.underline} But there is
nothing accidental about the way [[Berlin has]{.mark} systematically
[refused even to engage with American concerns]{.mark} over German
policy]{.underline} on the euro. During the Bush years, Europeans who
were unable to influence the strategy of the White House would give a
running commentary on American actions in lieu of a substantive policy.
They had no influence in Washington, so they complained. But now, the
tables are turned, with Obama passing continual judgment on German
policy while Chancellor Angela Merkel stoically refuses to heed his
advice. Europeans who for many years were infantilized by the
transatlantic alliance, either using sycophancy and self-delusion about
a \"special relationship\" to advance their goals or, in the case of
Jacques Chirac\'s France, pursuing the even more futile goal of
balancing American power, have finally come to realize that they can no
longer outsource their security or their prosperity to Uncle Sam.¶ [On
both sides of the Atlantic, the **[ties that held the alliance together
are weakening]{.mark}**.]{.underline} On the American side,
[[Obama]{.mark}\'s biography [links him to the Pacific and
Africa]{.mark} but not to the old continent]{.underline}. His personal
story echoes the demographic changes in the United States that have
reduced the influence of Americans of European origin. Meanwhile, [on
the European side, the depth of [the euro crisis has crowded out]{.mark}
almost all [foreign policy from the agenda]{.mark} of Europe\'s top
decision-makers. The [end of the Cold War mean]{.mark}s that [Europeans
no longer need]{.mark} American [protection]{.mark}, and the [U.S.
financial crisis has led to a fall in]{.mark} American [demand for
European products]{.mark}]{.underline} (although U.S. exports to Europe
are at an all-time high).¶ [What\'s more, Obama\'s lack of warmth has
precluded him from establishing the sorts of human relationships with
European leaders that animate alliances.]{.underline} When asked to name
his closest allies, Obama mentions non-European leaders such as Recep
Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Lee Myung-bak of South Korea. And his
transactional nature has led to a neglect of countries that he feels
will not contribute more to the relationship \-- within a year of being
elected, Obama had managed to alienate the leaders of most of Europe\'s
big states, from Gordon Brown to Nicolas Sarkozy to Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero. Americans hardly remember, but Europe\'s collective nose was
put out of joint by Obama\'s refusal to make the trip to Europe for the
2010 EU-U.S. summit. More recently, [Obama has reached out to allies to
counteract the impression that the only way to get a friendly reception
in Washington is to be a problem nation \-- but far too late to erase
the sense that Europe matters little to this American
president.¶]{.underline} [[Underlying these]{.mark} superficial [issues
is a]{.mark} more **[fundamental divergence]{.mark}** [in the way Europe
and the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [are coping with]{.mark}
their respective [declines]{.mark}. [As the EU\'s role shrinks]{.mark}
in the world, [Europeans have sough]{.mark}t to help build [a
multilateral, rule-based world]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is why it is
they, rather than the Chinese or the Americans, that have pushed for the
creation of institutionalized global responses to climate change,
genocide, or various trade disputes. To the extent that today\'s world
has not collapsed into the deadlocked chaos of a \"G-zero,\" it is often
due to European efforts to create a functioning institutional order.¶
[[To Washington\'s eternal frustration]{.mark}, however, [Europeans have
not put]{.mark} their energies [into becoming a]{.mark} full [partner on
global issues ]{.mark}]{.underline}. For all the existential angst of
the euro crisis, Europe is not as weak as people think it is. It still
has the world\'s largest market and represents 17 percent of world
trade, compared with 12 percent for the United States. Even in military
terms, the EU is the world\'s No. 2 military power, with 21 percent of
the world\'s military spending, versus 5 percent for China, 3 percent
for Russia, 2 percent for India, and 1.5 percent for Brazil, according
to Harvard scholar Joseph Nye. But, ironically for a people who have
embraced multilateralism more than any other on Earth, [[Europeans have
not pooled]{.mark} their impressive [economic]{.mark}, [political, and
military resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. And with the eurozone\'s need
to resolve the euro crisis, the EU may split into two or more tiers \--
making concerted action even more difficult. [As a result, [European
power is too diffuse to be much of a help or a hindrance on many
issues.]{.mark}]{.underline}
