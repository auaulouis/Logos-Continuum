TAIPEI, Taiwan --- **[Taiwan is responding to China's arms buildup by
developing missiles and interceptors of its own that could reduce
Beijing's military advantage]{.underline}** over the self-ruled island,
defence experts say. **[Since]{.underline}** President Tsai Ing-wen took
office in **[2016, Taiwan has deployed one set of missiles, perfected
another and sped production of a third]{.underline}**, the analysts say,
in the latest sign of how it's handling a Chinese military threat that
is raising the chances of an armed confrontation. Chinese President
**[Xi Jinping has taken a hard line against advocates of independence
for Taiwan]{.underline}** and has sent warships, bombers and fighter
planes on training missions circling the democratic island in a show of
strength. While Beijing has an increasingly overwhelming military
advantage, **[Taiwan's missile systems advance its odds of holding off
China in asymmetrical warfare]{.underline}**, said Alexander Huang,
strategic studies professor at Tamkang University in Taiwan. The term
refers to effective resistance of an enemy with targeted firepower
rather than overwhelming force. **["Taiwan with limited resources can
only invest in the area that would create some kind of asymmetrical
advantage]{.underline}**, which would dissuade the Chinese from taking
actions," Huang said. "President **[Tsai has committed more or at least
expressed willingness to invest more in the asymmetrical
capability]{.underline}**." Taiwan\'s greatest promise is the hope that
the United States and its allies could decide to assist Taiwan if and
when Taiwan is under threat The two sides have been separately ruled
since the Chinese civil war of the 1940s, and China still claims
sovereignty over Taiwan. Beijing has not ruled out using force to unify
the sides, a threat it has highlighted amid Tsai's continuing rejection
of its demand that both interact as parts of a single Chinese nation.
Hsiung Feng IIE missiles built in Taiwan have been deployed to hit
military bases in China up to 1,500 kilometres (932 miles) away, said
David An, senior research fellow with the policy incubator Global Taiwan
Institute in Washington, D.C. Those missiles also underwent a
"substantial upgrade" last year to increase their effectiveness against
ships, An said. Meanwhile, Taiwan has stepped up production of its
indigenous Wan Chien air-to-ground cruise missiles by about 100, An
added. Backing up those improvements, the locally developed Tien Kung
system can now intercept Chinese missiles at ranges of up to 200
kilometres (124 miles), An said. PAVE PAW, a U.S. long-range early
warning radar system located in Taiwan's high central mountain range,
would track incoming missiles or aircraft. Taiwanese Defence Ministry
spokesman Chen Chung-chi declined to confirm deployment of the Hsiung
Feng IIE missiles after the military news website Kanwa Defence Review
posted photos indicating they were situated about 50 kilometres (31
miles) west of the capital, Taipei, near the island's major
international airport. Kanwa did not answer requests for comment.
China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for
comments on Taiwan's missile program. "**[They are looking more at
building their land-based military capabilities]{.underline}**," said
Collin Koh, maritime security research fellow at Nanyang Technological
University in Singapore. To pressure Tsai into meeting its demands, the
communist leadership has flown military aircraft near the island a dozen
times and passed China's only functioning aircraft carrier through the
160-kilometre (100-mile) ocean strait separating them. China has a
powerful arsenal of missiles targeting Taiwan and raised its military
budget by 8.1 per cent this year, compared to Taiwan's increase of about
2 per cent in 2017-2018. China is building warships at a world-setting
pace, while also developing stealth fighters and bomb-delivering
vehicles that travel at up to six times the speed of sound. Military
experts call the deployment of the Hsiung Feng IIE missiles likely. "It
has been successfully developed," said Andrew Yang, a former Taiwanese
defence minister and current secretary general of the Chinese Council of
Advanced Policy Studies think-tank . "They've test fired many times and
called it successful." China deploys surface-to-air missiles on disputed
island claimed by three nations, Taiwan says **[Taiwan will reach out to
domestic, foreign arms supply to beef up defence in response to China
increase in military budget]{.underline}** China and Taiwan have never
fought a full-scale war, though in the late 1950s, China shelled
outlying islands controlled by Taiwan without taking them. Former
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou eased tensions during his 2008-2016
term by allowing talks with China on Beijing's terms, but frictions have
resumed under Tsai. **[Success in an asymmetric war would hinge on
Taiwan's budget]{.underline}**, the ability of its hardware and China's
attack strategy, military analysts say. **[Taiwan's current crop of
missiles can probably hit ships and sink transport
vessels]{.underline}**, An said. Taiwan should also focus on resisting
an amphibious landing, which China's People's Liberation Army Navy "has
not demonstrated the ability to do without significant cost," he said.
Taiwan still lags in submarines and stealth aircraft, An said. It looks
to the United States for much of its air force fleet and hopes
Washington will license it diesel-electric submarine technology. China
routinely denounces defenceco-operation between Taiwan and the U.S., but
has been unable to prevent what limited arms sales and exchanges have
occurred. Last Monday, President Donald Trump signed the John S. McCain
National Defence Authorization Act, which among its clauses calls for a
"comprehensive assessment of Taiwan's military forces" with an eye
toward helping them. "Taiwan's greatest promise is the hope that the
United States and its allies could decide to assist Taiwan if and when
Taiwan is under threat," An said.

**[Debates over deterrence strategies]{.underline}**, **[force postures,
and defense procurements are important]{.underline}**. **[However,
Taiwan's leaders must address two, far more fundamental questions:
first, should they ask their people to fight if Taiwan's territorial
integrity is violated]{.underline}** and its political sovereignty faces
extinction? **[And second, if they do make this request, will their
people heed their call to take up arms, to fight]{.underline}**, and to
risk dying to preserve those twin values? Available polling data and the
interviews we conducted in Taipei in early 2018 suggest **[the answers
to these questions remain troublingly elusive]{.underline}**. A number
of interviewees made comments touching on one or both of these crucial
issues. **[We heard concerns from senior political leaders that the
military might not fight if ordered]{.underline}**. Several government
officials and academics warned that **[the people might lack the resolve
to sustain a prolonged fight over Taiwan's survival]{.underline}**.
Others went further, claiming that Taiwan should in fact not fight to
defend its sovereignty against China, even if the capability and resolve
exists.218 In their opinion, Taiwan's sovereignty is not worth the lives
it would cost to protect. Polling data reinforces some of these fears
and concerns, although it is important to point out that Taiwan's
citizens remain deeply divided on such matters. For instance,
approximately one-third of respondents in one poll said Taiwan should
not fight if China attacks it. At the same time, younger
citizens---members of the Millennial generation---appear slightly more
willing to fight and perceive China less favorably than the average
citizen. Similarly, the number of people who identify as Taiwanese has
risen dramatically over the past three decades. **[The fact that severe
disagreements abound in society over whether to fight is
problematic]{.underline}**. For one, **[a robust defense and deterrence
posture requires the support of a country]{.underline}**. Taiwan would
not face a deterrence trilemma if there were widespread support for
significantly more defense spending. **[The absence of consensus makes
it hard to marshal resources towards defense and deterrence measures in
peacetime---to say nothing of wartime]{.underline}**. Taiwan's political
and military leaders will increasingly be forced to adopt stopgap
solutions and compromises that fail to address critical vulnerabilities
and weaknesses. Most important, deterrence will suffer. Over time, the
lack of public support and the erosion of military capability it
engenders will take a toll on Taiwan's credibility. The loss

To begin to get at these crucial issues, this section examines social
resilience. **[Deterrence depends on credibility]{.underline}**. **[And
credibility depends on the ability to field a well-trained,
well-equipped fighting force motivated by the knowledge that it enjoys
the support of the people it defends]{.underline}**. **[This requirement
becomes especially critical if an asymmetric military response of the
sort we advocate in this monograph will be adopted]{.underline}**.
Indeed, **[one study finds that soldiers must overcome a range of
stressors that affect their combat effectiveness: workload, fear of
danger, boredom, a sense of ambiguity surrounding their mission, and
feelings of isolation that define warfare]{.underline}**.219 Individuals
who have a sense of personal control, are satisfied with their work and
accomplishments, and adaptable to change have what psychologists
describe as "personality hardiness."220 Communities that contain such
individuals are more able to withstand uncertainty. Individuals who
evaluate their life experiences from a hardiness approach are more
resilient. Societies can be mobilized on the basis of a shared national
identity.221 National identity is a type of collective identity
predicated on a demarcated territorial component (i.e., a homeland), the
belief that members of the group are nominally equal, and a sense of
shared community, institutions, and values.222 In Taiwan's context, the
strength of national identity has been the matter of intense debate in
both policy and academic circles. The Election Study Center at National
Chengchi University has investigated and recorded changes in
individuals' identification as Taiwanese, Chinese, or both since the
early 1990s. Initially, its surveys found that most people in Taiwan saw
themselves as both Chinese and Taiwanese. By the early 2000s, however,
growing numbers began identifying solely as Taiwanese.

//um-ef)

**[The problem with buying U.S. systems wholesale is that they are
expensive, designed to project power over great distances, and maximize
mobility and networks to take the fight to the enemy with overwhelming
superiority]{.underline}**. **[Taiwan on the other hand, needs the
opposite]{.underline}**: systems that are short-range and defensive,
able to survive an initial bombardment from a larger adversary, and
suitable for deployment close to home in defense of the island should it
come under blockade or attack. **[Despite mirror-imaging the U.S.
military in its doctrine, training, and capabilities for decades, Taiwan
has begun to chart its own course]{.underline}**. **[Taiwan's new
defense concept employs an asymmetric defense strategy]{.underline}**,
where Taiwan maximizes its defense advantages, and targets an invading
force when it is at its weakest. **[Whereas Taiwan's previous strategy
focused on fighting across the entire Taiwan Strait and defeating the
enemy through attrition, the new concept divides Taiwan's defense
operations into two phases, both closer to Taiwan's shores where the
lines of communication are short and Taiwan's forces can benefit from
land-based air denial and more effective surveillance and
reconnaissance]{.underline}**. The first phase is the decisive battle in
the littoral, extending up to 100 kilometers from the island. Key
capabilities at this phase will include sea mines, and large surface
vessels equipped with Taiwan's capable, domestically manufactured
anti-ship cruise missiles, the Hsiung Feng 2 and 3. Taiwan's surface
fleet includes larger vessels from the legacy force, such as
French-built Lafayette class frigates, U.S.-built Kidd-class destroyers,
and U.S.-designed Perry class frigates armed with both Hsiung Feng and
Harpoon missiles, as well as a new class of fast attack Tuojiang class
catamarans that carry 16 missiles. Taiwan also fields anti-ship Hsiung
Feng missiles mounted on trucks that will disperse in order to survive
initial strikes. While evading detection in Taiwan's urban and
mountainous terrain, they will launch strikes at surface ships
throughout an invasion. The second phase **[seeks to annihilate the
enemy at the beach area, which extends approximately 40 kilometers
outwards from anticipated invasion beaches. This phase calls for
Taiwan's navy to lay mines in deep and shallow waters off suspected
landing beaches. A new fleet of automated, fast minelaying ships are
being built for that mission]{.underline}**. In the interim,
**[mine-launching rails can be installed on several classes of surface
vessels]{.underline}**. **[While invading ships are slowed by mine
fields, swarms of small fast attack boats and truck-launched anti-ship
cruise missiles will target key ships in the invasion
force]{.underline}**, particularly amphibious landing ships carrying the
initial wave of PLA assault troops as well as roll-on-roll-off vessels
carrying follow-on vehicles and armor. The Taiwan Army comes into play
at this phase, laying beach mines, and targeting enemy ships with
precision fires, including minesweepers. Precision artillery will target
any vessels and troops reaching shore, using area effects weapons such
as indigenously built multiple launch rocket systems with cluster
munitions, and attack helicopters including AH-64E Apaches. The Taiwan
Air Force will seek to deny Chinese fighters, bombers and drones from
Taiwan's battlespace by deploying integrated air defenses, including
Patriot PAC-3 batteries and domestically manufactured Tian Kung-2
surface to air missiles that are assigned to defend air bases and
critical infrastructure, and smaller mobile air defense systems, such as
U.S.-provided Avenger systems to prevent the PLA Air Force from
providing close-in air support to their invading forces. Mines and
Missiles **[Sea mines are a critical capability at the heart of the
Overall Defense Concept]{.underline}**. Historically, sea mines have
proven difficult to counter, and effective at slowing invasion forces.
In the Korean War, the U.S. invasion force at Incheon landed before
North Koreans could deploy sea mines. U.S. forces landed quickly, met
heavy resistance ashore, and found warehouses full of mines after they
cleared the beach. At the attack on Wonson a month later, sea mines were
deployed offshore before the planned invasion. Two minesweepers were
destroyed by mines while under fire from shore-based artillery, and
clearing operations took two weeks. U.S. Marine and Army units embarked
on transports had to wait five days offshore for lanes to be cleared,
which only happened after North Korean forces abandoned their positions.
**[The government-led National Chung Shan Institute for Science and
Technology (NCSIST), Taiwan's main designer and manufacturer of defense
articles, is currently developing two new types of shallow and
deep-water influence mines]{.underline}**, **[which they plan to deploy
by 2021]{.underline}**. They are also developing a self-propelled mine
with a planned deployment date around 2025. Until then, Taiwan has been
refurbishing its current mine inventory, which includes domestically
manufactured Wan Xiang mines, and MK-6 mines acquired from the United
States. Taiwan has also sought U.S.-manufactured MK62 Quickstrike
air-deployed mines, which could be rapidly deployed by C-130s or P-3Cs,
but the sale of that critical capability has not yet been approved by
the U.S. Department of Defense. **[The Hsiung Feng 2 and 3 missiles are
the other weapons at the heart of the Overall Defense Concept. These
missiles are fielded by surface ships and fired ashore from a handful of
vulnerable fixed batteries]{.underline}**, and from batteries of truck
launchers. With the expectation that large surface ships will be primary
targets neutralized early in a conflict, the Overall Defense Concept
also relies on small fast attack vessels, such as the 112-foot long
Kuang Hwa which mounts four Hsiung Feng missiles, and can be quickly
reloaded in austere locations such as small fishing ports that dot
Taiwan's coastline. The Taiwan Navy is reportedly acquiring an even
smaller vessel that carries two missiles. NCSIST is upgrading missiles
and increasing production of anti-ship cruise missiles, land attack
cruise missiles, and surface-to-air missiles to arm new ships and
launchers, deepen magazines, and ensure that Taiwan's armed forces have
sufficient munitions to hold out for an extended period. Force
Preservation **[Force preservation is a critical aspect of the Overall
Defense Concept]{.underline}**. **[Survivability and continued
effectiveness following initial PLA strikes have taken on greater
urgency, especially as China's investments in anti-access/area-denial
and power projection capabilities are anticipated to slow a U.S.
response force]{.underline}**. Taiwan is already experienced in
hardening its military infrastructure to withstand attacks, and the
Overall Defense Concept calls on the military to increase investments in
key capabilities including mobility, deception, camouflage, concealment,
jamming, redundancy, rapid repair, and reconstitution. While these
attributes are often neglected by militaries around the world because
they are not visible or prestigious, the new defense concept recognizes
that they are a critical aspect of Taiwan's credible deterrence and
prioritizes them in the competition for scarce defense dollars. Orphans
of the Overall Defense Concept **[The new concept is animated by the
most critical mission of the Taiwan military: denying China the ability
to land and resupply an invasion force]{.underline}**. Beijing can use
blockades, coercion, hybrid warfare, or "gray zone" pressure, but the
only thing that guarantees Beijing can achieve its political objective
of Taiwan's surrender is putting Chinese boots on the ground and
physically seizing control of the island. Preventing that outcome is
therefore the most fundamental mission. Taiwan's military also has a
multitude of peacetime missions and other potential contingencies that
it must man, train, and equip for. Taiwan will therefore continue to
invest in platforms that do not directly support the concept, or are
unlikely to survive the initial waves of fire strikes that are expected
to precede an invasion. **[Taiwan's vulnerable runways and the inability
to disperse outside the range of Chinese strikes makes the Taiwan Air
Force's fixed-wing assets unlikely to play a decisive role in a
conflict]{.underline}**. The president of Taiwan has expressed interest
in acquiring F-35B short-takeoff fighters, but even that capable
aircraft is unlikely to be able to operate effectively following PLA
strikes that will devastate Taiwan's airbases. The Taiwan Air Force's
future fighter will primarily serve a deterrent role defending Taiwan's
airspace in peacetime. The Air Force will make its wartime contributions
with mobile air defenses, small drones, and maintaining critical
infrastructure to enable a joint defense. The Taiwan Navy is building
large amphibious transport vessels and a future large air defense
destroyer, which are also likely to be targeted and sunk in the early
phases of a conflict. It is unclear what role Taiwan's future Indigenous
Defense Submarine will play targeting the surface ships of an invasion
force since it is assumed it will be a large, conventional diesel
electric design similar to its existing two submarines, optimized for
deep, open water, rather than the shallows found in the Taiwan Strait.
Investments in submarines, large surface vessels, and fighter aircraft
are necessary for Taiwan to re-capitalize its aging legacy force so the
Air Force and Navy can continue to provide peacetime deterrence. **[The
challenge for Taiwan is ensuring that there is adequate defense funding
for these large, prestige-enhancing platforms (that are the darlings of
their service chiefs), as well as the small, maneuverable, and
survivable asymmetric systems that are critical to Taiwan's
survival]{.underline}**. Cooperation with the United States Taiwan's new
defense concept presents both challenges and opportunities for
cooperation with the U.S. military. Sales of large, expensive U.S.-made
arms have certain benefits --- they are a visible and tangible signal of
U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense, which boosts morale in Taiwan and
uncertainty in Beijing, and they are a critical form of political
deterrence in that respect. U.S.-supplied systems also provide the
potential for interoperability with the U.S. military, and potentially
other countries in the region. Taiwan's proximity to China is an
advantage that could benefit networked U.S. forces operating at greater
stand-off distances. For example, a sensor operated by Taiwan could feed
data to networked U.S. planes and ships operating at a distance to
increase their awareness of threats and improve targeting. One challenge
is that **[Taiwan's defense needs are diverging from the expertise and
systems the U.S. military can provide]{.underline}**. For example, the
U.S. Marine Corps does not have a dedicated opposing force that Taiwan
could train with to hone their skills in defending beaches. Commanders
of Taiwan's squadrons of small fast attack boats can find no counterpart
in the U.S. Navy to train with. U.S. Navy mine warfare is
under-resourced, unappreciated and mines are considered a problem, not a
solution. Offensive mining may be making a comeback, however, in light
of the U.S. strategy identifying China as a key threat. The U.S. Navy
has recently signaled its developing interest in mine warfare, publicly
demonstrating the deployment of Quickstrike mines from a B-52 in
September during exercise Valiant Shield 18. With every challenge comes
opportunity. As the U.S. Army develops its multi-domain battle concept
and applies it to the Indo-Pacific, it will increasingly realize that
China is the challenge, and the battlespace is Taiwan. Adm. Harry
Harris, then commanding Pacific Command, spoke at the Association of the
U.S. Army conference in 2016, reduced the task to, "Army's got to be
able to sink ships." U.S. Army could find solutions and opportunities
for expanding their reach into the maritime domain by studying and
innovating alongside their counterparts in Taiwan. Conclusion **[The
beauty of Adm. Lee's Overall Defense Concept is that it embraces an
asymmetric strategy, does not seek to compete with China's larger
military head on, and focuses Taiwan's resources on targeting the
greatest threat, while surviving long enough for third-party
intervention]{.underline}**. **[It eschews traditional symmetrical
warfighting of surface action groups, fighter planes, or tanks slugging
it out head-to-head. Instead, it takes a page from guerilla warfare and
envisions large numbers of small, affordable, highly mobile units taking
advantage of the terrain to defeat a larger enemy]{.underline}**. U.S.
defense experts should consider these concepts as well as they
contemplate how the U.S. military can address the threat from
increasingly capable adversaries. **[With its new Overall Defense
Concept, opportunities for collaboration with Taiwan to address
asymmetric challenges will increase.]{.underline}**

the nature of public **[opinion in China]{.underline}**. **[Various

These examples of Chinese public opinion raise doubts about the
conventional wisdom on China. While many claim there is no civil society
in China, the number of NGOs has steadily grown over the past decade or
more. Most do not engage in political activities, but do offer useful
cultural and social goods and services. The Party aggressively censors
social media and the Internet, but most people claim they do not
encounter censorship while online, and of those who do, the most common
response is "it doesn't matter," not outrage. While most outside
observers ---and Party leaders themselves---posit that economic growth
is the primary source of the Party's legitimacy, **[GDP growth is
uncorrelated with regime support]{.underline}**. Instead, pocketbook
factors, in particular **[recent gains in family income and expectations
of additional gains in the near future, are a prominent source of regime
support.]{.underline}** The main tenet of modernization theory---that
economic modernization leads to democracy---does not yet fit the Chinese
case. China may come to experience what is often called a revolution of
rising expectations that will generate societal pressure for
democratization, but there is scant evidence of that as of yet.¶ The
prospects for regime change depend on more than just popular support, of
course. Elite splits, coups, civil wars, and crises (like defeat in war
and economic decline) are more often the triggers for regime change. But
the **[findings presented here, consistent with other surveys in China,
indicate that the regime currently does not face insurmountable
challenges to the status quo from society. Chinese elites]{.underline}**
may not have a full consensus on their policy goals or how to achieve
them, but they **[also do not have to cope with a society impatient for
political change]{.underline}**. The Party does have to contend with
**[dissidents and other political activists]{.underline}**, but these
individuals **[seem to have little popular support.¶ When public opinion
is generally content with the status quo and optimistic about the
direction of the country, we should not anticipate a revolutionary
moment is imminent]{.underline}**. In this kind of context, **[China
watchers should not interpret each local protest as a portent of regime
change]{.underline}**. **[Protests are mostly limited to material
demands---payment of wages and pensions, illegal land-grabs by local
officials, opposition to industrial and commercial development plans,
the cover-up of local corruption and malfeasance---and are often
successful]{.underline}**. In fact, these **[protests provide useful
information to higher-level officials about what is happening at the
local level]{.underline}**.30 **[Officials are often willing to make
concessions on these types of material demands, while also singling out
a few alleged protest leaders for punishment]{.underline}**. The Party
may be willing to address the demands of protestors, but it does not
want to encourage other people to engage in strikes and other public
protests. Rather than an indicator of opposition to the regime,
**[protests may be a valuable source of feedback]{.underline}**. There
are certainly risks in using protests as feedback, but **[local protests
have not yet coalesced into organized social movements]{.underline}**.
That would be a much more threatening development for the Party, which
is why it prevents groups with similar interests from engaging in
organized collective action.

guerrilla warfare to make the costs of invasion and occupation
prohibitively high for China]{.underline}**. It is radical because our
proposed strategy means that **[Taiwan should]{.underline}**
reconsider---if not **[renounce---its predilection for wanting high-end
military platforms]{.underline}**, **[prepare its society for fighting
an insurgency campaign]{.underline}**, **[and plan most intensely for a
war that would not see the United States coming to its
rescue]{.underline}**. These changes may require challenging and even
overturning long-held orthodoxies in Taiwan's strategic thinking, but we
believe that they are necessary if Taiwan wishes to retain its de facto
independence indefinitely. We mentioned once in passing that **[Taiwan
should learn from the example of Estonia and, by extension, the other
Baltic states]{.underline}**. Some readers might object to this claim
because Taiwan is an island country that has a trillion-dollar economy
and about four times the population than the Baltic states do in
aggregate. Yet we insist that their example is instructive for Taiwan.
Those states have many benefits that Taiwan unfortunately lacks:
extensive international recognition and representation as well as
security treaty links with 26 countries that include the United States.
These benefits have not translated to complacency, however. Some
uncertainty abounds as to Russian intentions toward the Baltic region.
Although the Kremlin has declared the protection of Russian minorities
in its geopolitical neighborhood a priority, doubts exist over whether
Russia will go so far as to use military force against any of the three
NATO members.252 In light of this uncertainty, the Baltic countries have
taken a number of measures to improve their denial capabilities lest
Russia would attack them. They have increased their defense spending to
meet their NATO commitments, reintroduced conscription, and
maintained---at least in the case of Lithuania and Latvia---a robust
volunteer militia force. These countries do not have their own air
forces and lack any significant naval assets. Nor do they have any
ambition to acquire any major military platforms. They understand that
these platforms would be lost in the opening phases of any full frontal
assault on their lines if Russia were to attack. Taiwan might have the
buffer of the Strait that complicates any invasion plans that China
could have. Still, water ultimately does not have stopping power:
coastal defenses and manpower do. The future does not look like the
past, when China lacked the maritime capabilities to mount an assault
across the Strait for the longest time. Though we acknowledge that
amphibious operations are perhaps the most difficult to do militarily,
**[China's efforts at modernizing its armed forces do not bode well for
Taiwan]{.underline}**. Even if we suspect that China prefers to resolve
Taiwan's status peacefully, we know from historical experience that wars
can still happen. **[Beijing might feel pressure to exploit a window of
opportunity, whether or not Taipei realizes it]{.underline}**.
Accordingly, **[Taiwan needs to prepare for the worst-case scenario in
the appropriate manner: making sure that it can last as long as possible
in a military confrontation with China without the help of
others]{.underline}**. We conclude with two thoughts. The first is that
although Taiwan should plan on the assumption that the United States
will not provide military support in the event of an armed crisis with
China, we would contend that **[our strategy in fact increases the
likelihood of U.S. assistance.]{.underline}** Of course, no one
knows---not even U.S. decision-makers---the conditions under which the
United States will intervene to rescue Taiwan. Nevertheless, the United
States will likely not rush into war on Taiwan's behalf if China can
pull a dramatic fait accompli for the island. However, **[Washington
will very likely provide assistance if it sees that Taiwan can
effectively resist China for an extended period of time on its
own]{.underline}**. The case of Ukraine is partly instructive. The
United States initially imposed a few sanctions on Russia after its
illegal annexation of Crimea and little more. Over time, as Ukraine has
demonstrated its battlefield resiliency against Russian forces, the
United States began increasing its military support. Taiwan does not
have the territorial depth of Ukraine and so much less time would be on
its side, but what matters is that Taiwan may need to demonstrate that
it can properly help itself before it can receive the help from others.
The second thought concerns the very desirability of pursuing a
conventional military strategy. Some readers might conclude from this
monograph that the balance of power is so hopeless for Taiwan that
Chinese victory is inevitable. As such, the nuclear weapons option ought
to receive consideration. Such assessments would be terribly wrong,
however. The worst thing that Taiwan could do is to reopen the nuclear
question. To begin with, Taiwan would be unable to reconstitute a
nuclear weapons program in secret. Throughout the 1960s and the 1970s,
Washington was aware of Taiwanese efforts to procure sensitive nuclear
technologies. In 1987, a double agent informed the intelligence
community in the United States of Taiwanese activities.253 The
likelihood that this sort of intelligence experience would repeat
itself, whether with a Chinese or U.S. double agent, is high. Disclosure
of this program would almost certainly provoke the very thing that the
nuclear weapons would purportedly seek to deter: a Chinese military
attack. Even if Taiwan were somehow to succeed in secretly developing
nuclear weapons, it would have to disclose those capabilities eventually
in order to realize their deterrent benefits. Yet such a gesture would
still be profoundly destabilizing because Chinese decision-makers would
probably feel intense domestic pressure to use military force before
Taiwan acquires reliable delivery vehicles or a survivable second-strike
capability. Worsening this situation is that Taiwan would remain highly
vulnerable precisely because it chose to neglect its own defenses. A
robust conventional military posture is thus the safer and more prudent
posture for Taiwan because it will not encourage such dynamics.

//um-ef)

Prioritize Denial Operations: The Four Denials **[If Taiwan must choose
between optimizing its military forces to combat grey zone provocations
or an invasion scenario, then we think it should focus on the
latter]{.underline}**. To repeat, grey zone operations are neither
necessary nor sufficient for China to realize its goals. Attacking and
occupying Taiwan, in contrast, is certainly sufficient and likely
necessary**[. The logic of deterrence thus demands that Taiwan's
military focus on raising the costs of an "unlikely worst
case]{.underline}**," even to the degree that it means accepting risk
against the "most likely case." **[We believe the best way to deter
China from invading is to "flip" the antiaccess threat on its
head]{.underline}**.10 **[Doing so will require reorienting Taiwan's
active duty air, naval, and ground forces away from
symmetric-conventional defensive operations and toward
asymmetric-unconventional denial operations]{.underline}**. We define
and distinguish these terms below. Suffice it to say for now, **[we
suggest that Taiwan abandon any intention of holding onto any particular
air space, naval zone, or piece of ground]{.underline}**. The harsh
reality is that the PLA's ever-growing quantitative and qualitative
advantages mean that it could inevitably overwhelm Taiwan's defensive
network in any given battlespace. Moreover, **[to commit its limited
forces to the defense of any given battlespace, Taiwan must accept
vulnerability in another battlespace]{.underline}**. Taiwan is a big
island. As the attacker, China will have the first mover advantage.
Thus, a big risk exists that China could draw a significant portion of
Taiwan's military into the all-out defense of a specific zone, only to
strike the decisive blow elsewhere. **[Instead of committing to a "none
shall pass" defense of any one zone, Taiwan should adopt an elastic
denial concept across the entirety of its air, sea, territory, and
society. Denial sets a lower bar than defense]{.underline}**. Whereas
defense implies retaining control, **[denial simply requires that Taiwan
prevent an invader from controlling a particular zone even if Taiwan
cannot itself exercise control over that same space]{.underline}**.
**[Elasticity implies that Taiwan will deny a zone until its forces
suffer unacceptable casualties.]{.underline}** **[At that point,
Taiwan's units will conduct a deliberate, fighting withdraw so as to
prepare to deny an invader access to a successive zone]{.underline}**.
As with all elastic concepts**[, the idea is to force an attacker to
trade lives and equipment for space]{.underline}**. **[And once an
attacker has "paid the price" to capture a given battlezone, the
defender shifts back in order to force the attacker to repeat the
process again]{.underline}**. Unlike elastic defenses, an elastic denial
concept means repeating this process ad infinitum rather than ever
committing to a main line of resistance. Given that China's political
goals require it to capture not just the entirety of Taiwan's air, sea,
and territory but also the hearts and minds of its citizens, the invader
would very likely have to consider whether it is willing to trade lives
and equipment in perpetuity to accomplish its goals. In practical terms,
we thus identify four denial zones: air, naval, ground, and social.
Taiwan's active duty forces would have primary responsibility for the
first three zones. A newly constituted territorial defense force, which
we discuss in chapter 5, will focus on social denial. **[To prepare for
denial operations, we suggest that Taiwan's air force and navy trade
quality for quantity. That is, it should use the money it will save from
not developing and/or acquiring indigenous submarines, Aegis-like
surface ships, and the F-35 to instead invest in mass-produced air and
naval drones; semisubmersibles; surface-to-air missiles; tactical
missile defense systems; antiship cruise missiles; mines (and mine
layers); and three-dimensional (3D) printing]{.underline}**. We discuss
the individual rationale behind acquiring each of these weapons and
argue that Taiwan's economy is particularly well positioned to research,
develop, and produce such weapons indigenously. As we also note later in
the manuscript, it should also be able to develop concepts for employing
them. **[The capabilities that we believe that Taiwan should acquire
will radically increase the price that China must pay to fight its way
across the Taiwan Strait and to come ashore]{.underline}**.
Specifically, the combination of large numbers of cheap weapons creates
a daunting targeting challenge for an invader. **[By investing heavily
in quantity---particularly in weapons that are "good enough" and can be
rapidly replaced in combat---an attacker will never be able to take out
enough such weapons to ensure success at an acceptable
price]{.underline}**. To offer a few examples, consider the following: •
The proliferation of SAMs and tactical missile defense systems--- along
with a fundamental shift in how they are used---will force China to
expend large quantities of its long-range precision strike weapons. Air
and missile defense systems could include, for example, the TK-III,
PAC-3, and ground-launched versions of the AIM-120 and AIM-9X. •
Abandoning "exquisite" surface ships and a small number of highly
capable submarines in favor of a large number of unmanned and small
manned submersibles; extremely small and maneuverable missile and radar
boats; shore-based ASCM batteries; and naval mines also forces China to
expend more of its long-range precision strike weapons. At the same
time, since some of these capabilities will inevitably survive, China's
leaders will have to accept the loss of its surface ships and amphibious
transport ships that are each laden with thousands of ground troops. 22
A Question of Time: Enhancing Taiwan's Conventional Deterrence Posture •
Swarms of relatively low-tech drones designed for one-way "suicide"
missions (and quickly replaced via 3D printing) can target invasion
fleets as they are both loading in port and sailing across the Strait.
Most drones will not hit their target, but the gambit will be
inexpensive enough that Taiwan can afford to overwhelm air defense units
assigned to protect the invasion fleet. If nothing else, this tactic
forces China to decide whether it is willing to accept greater risk. •
Ground combat units trained and equipped to man coastal defenses then
transition to waging a protracted, highly mobile series of "fighting
retreats" from Taiwan's limited number of plausible landing zones along
the entirety of every major maneuver corridor will present invasion
planners with the daunting prospect of confronting an enemy that will
impose costs without ever presenting a static, massed target for
annihilation. **[Taiwan's current acquisitions strategy calls for a
small number of high-cost, "exquisite" platforms. Such an approach plays
to China's strengths]{.underline}**. Because Taiwan can only afford a
limited number of fifth-generation fighter aircraft, Aegis-like
warships, and diesel submarines---and because it takes so long to build
these weapons that Taiwan could never hope to replace combat losses in
an invasion scenario---**[it suffers from a dangerous vulnerability
given that China possesses a quantitative and qualitative
advantage]{.underline}**. With relative ease, China can concentrate its
intelligence assets on tracking Taiwan's finite number of highquality
weapons platforms. Using a combination of cyber-attacks, long-range
precision strikes, and old-fashioned sabotage, the attacker can likely
destroy, neutralize, or suppress enough of these weapons to proceed with
an invasion at an acceptable price. Organize a Territorial Defense
Force: The Fourth Denial **[The fourth and final denial zone is society
itself. Neither threats nor military violence can compel Taiwan as long
as a large enough fraction of its people is willing to resist. This
point holds true even in a worst-case invasion scenario]{.underline}**.
Indeed, the prospect of waging a years-long counterinsurgency could well
serve as the ultimate form of conventional deterrence.11 What
policymakers must realize is that insurgencies are not spontaneous. They
cannot assume that popular resistance will automatically emerge in the
aftermath of an invasion.12 Conducting hit and run ambushes on
conventional troops is inherently risky, and not just anyone can (or
should) attempt to these kinds of combat missions. Furthermore, engaging
in such attacks effectively requires specialized training. Because
Taiwan is an island located less than 100 miles away from its most
likely attacker, insurgents may well have to fight for months---or
longer---without external logistical and financial support of the type
that insurgent movements elsewhere in the world take for granted due to
porous land borders. Most importantly, since the goal is to deter an
invasion, rather than to fight one, **[Taiwan must credibly signal that
its people can and will wage a brutal insurgency under the harshest
conditions imaginable]{.underline}**. **[To signal that Taiwan's
citizens possess both the resolve and the capability to wage an
insurgency, Taiwan should consider turning its Reserve Command into a
Territorial Defense Force]{.underline}**. Currently, Taiwan has
approximately 2.5 million reservists. Divided into four tiers of
readiness, existing defense strategies call for these reservists to
largely augment, reinforce, and support active units, or perform a wide
range of disaster response, rear area security, and infrastructure
protection missions.

Terrains of the Chinese Factor as Frontiers and Borderlands
**[Given]{.underline}** such **[complex dynamics of US--China
relations]{.underline}** that have been unfolding, **[how could we
resignify what falls under the sign of "China]{.underline}**," **[within
and beyond the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,

**[Cold War]{.underline}** reflexes of **[hostility, demonization, and

"China factor"]{.underline}** **[as a code name for
China's]{.underline}** growing global **[political and economic
influences in the forms of]{.underline}** cheap
**[commodity]{.underline}**, crony **[capitalism]{.underline}**, **[and
soft power]{.underline}**. We have adopted a more capacious phrase,
**[the "Chinese factor," to both signal the ascent of the]{.underline}**
People's Republic of China (**[PRC]{.underline}**) **[and highlight what
such]{.underline}** dominant **[narratives have obscured:]{.underline}**
on the one hand, **[the wide-ranging]{.underline}** and multifaceted
**[formations]{.underline}** and contestations that the geopolitical
dynamics **[between the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[and China have set in motion]{.underline}**; on the other hand,
**[the heterogeneity of "Chinese" population and politics that implicate
Taiwan]{.underline}**, Hong Kong, Macau, **[and the vast "Chinese"
diaspora]{.underline}**.27 Whereas the China factor implies resistance
to the PRC,28 our use of **[Chinese factor emphasizes the ambivalence,
permeability,]{.underline}** and imbrication **[of the transpacific
dynamic in which China and Chinese are articulated with/in,
against]{.underline}**, and beyond the United States. **[If the China
factor implies]{.underline}** anxieties and **[fear, recalling the
"China threat]{.underline}**" or the Yellow Peril, the Chinese factor
**[suggests]{.underline}** alternative modalities of imagining and
**[reconceptualizing what has emerged out of]{.underline}** **[the
geopolitics of US--China relations]{.underline}**, **[including the
diverse forms]{.underline}** of "Chinese" presence **[that are making an
impact on the world today]{.underline}**. Giovanni Arrighi, for
instance, argues that the **[US--China relation today is less a rivalry
than a succession]{.underline}**: namely, **[China is poised to succeed
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[as the new global
hegemon because its market-oriented yet noncapitalist economy not only
endows China with greater]{.underline}** \[End Page 447\] **[strength
and]{.underline}** social **[legitimacy]{.underline}** but also has
**[laid the foundation for Beijing to lead and create a different world
based on the South--South alliance that he calls the "new
Bandung]{.underline}**."29 While **[this]{.underline}** **[possibility
could be seen through]{.underline}** such **[mega-projects as the
O]{.underline}**ne **[B]{.underline}**elt **[O]{.underline}**ne
**[R]{.underline}**oad Initiative, whether it will lead to the "new
Bandung" remains uncertain. What is more crucial to Arrighi's view of
China's economic success is his emphasis on **[the "overseas Chinese
capitalist diaspora]{.underline}**," which **[operated in the
multilayered subcontracting network built by the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Japan]{.underline}**, **[and entered the
Chinese market with cultural know-hows and]{.underline}** **[kinship
connections]{.underline}** to lead the boom.30 In this sense, the
Chinese capitalist diaspora, operating along transpacific and
inter-Asian axes, is as important a factor as China itself in
reorienting the global economy. Its multiple **[manifestations as
Chinese and otherwise suggest both the complexity of Chineseness and the
intimacy between the PRC and foreign capitals.]{.underline}** Put
differently, if one aim of the Chinese factor is to unravel the hidden
linkages and highlight the scope, complexity, contradiction, and
fluidity of what gets coded as "Chineseness" across the Pacific and
beyond, the other is to articulate the disjunctures of perceived and
prescribed identitarian categories and politics at the neoliberal moment
when China and the United States have become both conspirators and
rivals. **[To illustrate]{.underline}** and foreground the generative
theoretical, **[interpretive, and political possibilities of our
framing]{.underline}** of the Chinese factor, we begin this special
issue in an unconventional way with the "Collective Statement on Taiwan
Independence." Cowritten by Funie Hsu, Brian Hioe, and Wen Liu,
scholars, activists, and journalists based in the United States with a
commitment to the cause of Taiwan independence, **[the statement
indicates that Taiwan's political impasse is structured precisely by the
Chimerican geopolitics in which Taiwan is but a pawn purposefully kept
in limbo]{.underline}**. Clearly **[naming the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates' **[collusion]{.underline}** with China, **[the
statement attempts to advance the cause by building]{.underline}**
"**[steadfast alliance with marginalized communities and struggles for
justice around the world]{.underline}**." While **[the
statement]{.underline}** might appear to be more gestural than
substantive at the moment, it clearly **[demonstrates the]{.underline}**
transpacific imbrications of the Chinese factor: the **[division between
China and Taiwan created by US military empire]{.underline}**, **[the
identity of Taiwanese Americans, and the ascent of the PRC as an
expedient pretext for US nationalism under Trump]{.underline}**.
Moreover, **[it underscores the contradictions within the postcolonial
model of state-building, especially in the scheme of great power
politics]{.underline}**. While seeking to connect with liberation
movements in the United States and around the world, Taiwan independence
**[undergirded by]{.underline}** Han-Chinese **[centrism
i]{.underline}**ronically c**[omes into conflict with indigenous claims
of sovereignty]{.underline}**. This complex dilemma thus \[End Page
448\] raises the question: how can **[decolonization projects in
"frontiers" or border zones overwritten by multiple imperial powers
account for and respond to the contradictions created and exacerbated by
interimperial relations in order to articulate decolonization with
de-imperialization]{.underline}**?31 **[By reorienting American studies
through the prism of the Chinese factor, our special issue participates
in this double articulation by uncovering sites of entanglements and
contradictions while connecting lessons of struggle so as to push
against and transform the imperial foundation of knowledge claims about
US--China relations in American studies]{.underline}**. Importantly,
**[our critical aspiration prompts us to focus on spaces]{.underline}**
and relations **[structured by interimperial]{.underline}**,
imperial--local, and inter-Asian **[entanglements where the call for
decolonization and de-imperialization is most urgent.32]{.underline}**
In this special issue, we have assembled essays and forum pieces that
un-earth the global footprints of the American and Chinese Empires and
make explicit the transpacific and inter-Asian dynamic that sustains US
imperialism. Specifically, the essays perform two methodological
experiments for American studies: first, **[to conceptualize China in
relation to the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[by
attending to how they are entangled]{.underline}**---as competitors and
collaborators---in the shifting global order; and **[second, to reckon
with the plurality of what is signified by China]{.underline}**---not
only **[in terms of the Taiwan]{.underline}**--China melodrama, but also
through an array of **[frontiers]{.underline}**/borderlands (from Hong
Kong, Koje, Sahel, San Francisco, Iowa City to Buenos Aires), of
**[transpacific texts]{.underline}** (literary, cinematic, translation,
and legal), **[and]{.underline}** of **[liminal subjects]{.underline}**
(Chinese students, American mercenaries, Chinese prisoners of war, queer
migrants, activists, postapocalypse survivors, and nomadic kung fu
master) that, while seemingly external, **[have been]{.underline}**
uneasily **[incorporated into the US imperial]{.underline}** and
neoliberal **[orbits]{.underline}**. **[Our task is to
identify]{.underline}**, theorize, and dwell **[on]{.underline}** such
**[dis-eases of imperial incorporation in relation to China's ascendance
as a global power]{.underline}**. **[By exploring the multifacetedness
of the Chinese factor, we strive to reimagine American studies in the
"twilight" of the American Century]{.underline}** and America's Pacific
Century **[so]{.underline}** as **[to facilitate transpacific dialogues
and generate critical archives]{.underline}** and linkages.33 Moreover,
**[by gesturing to the specters of Chinese against orientalist
reiterations in relation to]{.underline}** the longue durée of US
Pacific **[expansion]{.underline}**, we attempt to activate moments,
archives, and interpretive strategies that transform the Pacific from a
place for imperial projections to both a space and a position of
critical interventions: that is, **[to resignify imperial frontiers as
borderlands of cultural and political struggles]{.underline}**. Daryl
Maeda's essay on the legendary martial artist Bruce Lee demonstrates
counterhegemonic creativity mediated and made possible by the Pacific,
where Lee's "Chinese" identity could become a \[End Page 449\] hegemonic
sign overshadowing the Filipino and Okinawan inspirations that informed
his martial arts form. **[Critical activation of the Chinese
factor]{.underline}** thus not only **[compels us to explore traces made
invisible by hegemonic knowledge through connecting sites beyond
conventional US global imaginary]{.underline}**; **[it]{.underline}**
also **[urges us to]{.underline}** both **[practice relational
comparative analyses]{.underline}** that Yến Lê Espiritu advocates in
the first forum and articulate their critical potentials: what new
knowledges and perspectives may emerge by juxtaposing the POW camps in
Koje Island with the International Writer's Workshop in Iowa City, by
considering disability legislations in the United States and China along
with their scrambles over resources in Africa, and by contrasting Bruce
Lee's nomadic passage to anticolonial masculinity with Hong Kong queer
migrants' rendezvous with Argentina as affective synecdoche of Hong
Kong's "return" to China? Moreover, tracing minor transnational
affinities against the imperial cartographies of Chimerica prompts us to
wonder: how has the promise of Third World revolution, once offered by
Mao Zedong's China, been halted and folded into the neoliberal present?
And how may a renewed attention to the competition, conflict, and
collusion between empires provide us insights into the mutations of
transpacific relations?

Methodological and Thematic Mappings: The Forums The two invited forums
in this special issue provide methodological and thematic anchors to
open up critical dialogue about how to think through the problematic of
the Chinese factor in the transpacific matrix, which the nine research
essays follow up with generative analyses that chart a wide range of
terrains for critical reorientation. The first forum, "Transpacific
Matters," featuring essays by Lisa Yoneyama, Yến Lê Espiritu, Mayumo
Inoue, Arnie Saiki, and Andrew Ross, first presents critical genealogies
of transpacific studies and then focuses on a set of critical
commentaries on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and US--China
relations. To broaden and complicate common binary conceptualizations of
US--China relations that erase the specificities of the Pacific, the
forum asks two concurrent questions: How would transpacific discourses
enrich critical articulations of the Chinese factor? How could current
formulations of transpacific studies be broadened and advanced by
engaging the rise of China discourse, refugee and indigenous Pacific
issues, and foreign policy and geopolitics of economic globalization?
While the question of China may not appear to be on the immediate
horizon of their concerns, the essays by Yoneyama, Espiritu, and Inoue
insightfully demonstrate how **[war, militarization, and the US postwar
settlement in Asia and the Pacific undergirded the economic discourse of
the transpacific with that of interimperial competition and
cooperation]{.underline}**: the transwar juncture from World War II to
Cold War for Yoneyama, militarized refuge(e)s scattered across the
Pacific for Espiritu, and the gendered structure of US--Japanese
"friendship" built on the sacrifice of \[End Page 452\] Okinawa for
Inoue. The relational comparative approach that Espiritu offers to
"\[mark\] t**[he military colonialisms, wars, and genocide that engulf
and link these \[seemingly unrelated\] spaces" of refuges, bases, and
struggles]{.underline}** is especially illuminating **[as a methodology
for thinking through the imperial--local contestations and the
interimperial intimacies that underscore our reconceptualization of the
global frontiers and borderlands in the era of US--China contention and
collusion]{.underline}**. **[Focusing on]{.underline}** the TPP as a
strategic instrument of the United States' **["pivot to
Asia]{.underline}**," the essays by Saiki and Ross rightly **[locate
this discourse as a crucial site to comprehend US transpacific
imagination about the rise of China, and demonstrate how free trade and
the free flow of capital are key to understanding and maintaining
hegemony]{.underline}**. Whereas Saiki offers an informative brief
historical account of economic globalization that undergirds the
**[political-economic discourse of "partnership]{.underline}**" in the
TPP, Ross **[provides a timely]{.underline}** and penetrating
**[analysis of the geopolitical scenarios after Trump was sworn in to
consider what it entails for the United States to bail out of the
TPP]{.underline}**. Together they show us how deeply the United States'
transpacific thinking is entangled with the perceived threats of China,
and how globalization has bound the two nations even tighter than
before, making gunboat diplomacy and worse a likely outcome in the
transpacific future.41 The second forum, "The China in US," focuses on a
fundamental question: How to understand US--China relations today from a
variety of angles? With this title, we contend that **[the Chinese
factor is not just about the United States and America's transpacific
but]{.underline}**, equally important, **[about those of "us" whose life
and work are inevitably tangled with China and
Chineseness]{.underline}**. Sharon Luk leads the discussion by
reflecting on how "**[China]{.underline}**," as a cultural alterity
**[produced]{.underline}** in relation to the **[racialized discourse of
development]{.underline}**, has been an enduring crisis for thought in
American studies. Grounding her remarks on the material history **[in
which the sign of China has been circulated across the Pacific, she
elucidates the ongoing contradictions embedded in the competing
imperialist and capitalist imperatives, to highlight dominant
multicultural projects as the condition of possibility rather than
either an antidote to, or binary opposite of, white supremacist
nationalism.]{.underline}** **[Framing China less as a civilizational
alterity than as a neoliberal successor]{.underline}**, Dirlik **[offers
a critical view on China's contemporary problems, from environmental
pollution to rampant ideological censorship, to blind pursuit of
developmen]{.underline}**t. Acknowledging the impact of China's rise on
the global order of power, especially on societies of the global South,
Dirlik argues that China in fact poses a serious problem to the world,
in which the Confucius Institute---**[wishing to exchange influence
abroad with money---has become an icon of imperial--neoliberal
collusions]{.underline}** \[End Page 453\] **[between the United States
and China]{.underline}**. In contrast, Christopher Leigh Connery, fully
aware of China's problems, casts a more sympathetic eye on China, in
particular Chinese intellectuals who are doubly pressured by **[China's
rise---to survive in the neoliberal enterprise of academic publishing
and the ideological censorship of the party-state---and calls for a
global critical culture to push back the imperialist and neoliberal
pressures.]{.underline}** The treacherous terrain of cultural critique
in China that Connery presents makes the call for decolonization and
de-imperialization even more urgent. But what do transpacific
geopolitical and geo-economic maneuvers mean to the people living within
the US--China entanglement, especially Chinese/Americans with strong
ties to the United States, China, and beyond?42 Specifically, how do we
make sense of the transpacific figure of the Chinese student that has
historically straddled both shores as it has been used by both states as
a means to national ends? To explore transpacific views in Chinese
American history, the forum invited Gordon H. Chang, whose Fateful Ties
has been inspirational to our special issue, and Yige Dong, a Chinese
international student who is working toward a PhD in sociology, to
reflect on these questions. **[Chang tells a rich story of the debates
among Chinese students in the 1930s about whether their future lies in
China or America, a debate that would continue to be "a vital concern"
for Chinese Americans as long as the United States "remains caught in
the dilemma of being a nation simultaneously of proclaimed equality and
of actual racial inequality and as long as one has the actual ability to
move."]{.underline}** In contrast, Dong provides critical sketches of
contemporary Chinese students' experiences in the United States against
the backdrop of China's rise to explain why they have become more
nationalist of late while planning to stay abroad as long as they can.
In particular, she draws our attention to the conundrum of Chinese
students who, as subjects of longstanding racism, have been recruited as
a "cash cow" to help sustain US public higher education. The solution to
such contradictory effects of racial capitalism, she argues, hinges on
the returning students' endeavors to transform China. Together, these
pieces engage a variety of Chinese factors that shed critical light on
the transpacific dynamic, revealing US--China relations to be a parallax
of competition and collusion, and remind us that a transpacific approach
to American studies needs to ground itself in the arduous labor of
epistemological reboot, coalition building, and negotiations of subject
positions. The Chinese factor is but the means, not the end, to critical
self-transformation in order to better comprehend and address our global
problems. \[End Page 454\]

The Pacific in the Transpacific In this sense, **[this]{.underline}**
special **[issue builds on Asia/Pacific studies]{.underline}** in the
1990s and the transpacific turn in Asian/American studies **[to
explore]{.underline}** the triangulations,
**[entanglements]{.underline}**, and intimacies between America, the
Pacific, and Asia**[. One]{.underline}** common **[way to trace the
transpacific as a]{.underline}** perspective, an imaginary, a
**[method]{.underline}**, and **[an official discourse foregrounds its
formation as emerging out of the]{.underline}** long **[history of
global trade and movement of people]{.underline}**, from the tea and
china trade between Boston and Canton in the eighteenth century to the
migrations of workers, students, and entrepreneurs to the gold mines,
chop-suey restaurants, universities, and high-tech companies across
America from the late nineteenth century to the present. Meanwhile, as
Lisa Yoneyama's essay in the first forum illuminates, **[the racism and
two world wars that]{.underline}** significantly **[restrained the
transpacific flows of goods, people, and culture in the first half of
the twentieth century remind us of another important genealogy of
transpacific analytics that center the geopolitics of US wars in Asia
and anti-imperial feminist struggles]{.underline}**. These struggles
against living legacies of wars persisted as the rebound of the East
Asian---especially Japanese---economy in the 1970s rekindled US economic
investment in the Asia/Pacific region, leading to the creation of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 1989 to spearhead free trade and
\[End Page 450\] neoliberal globalization. In this context, **[the
Pacific functions as a "frontier" that embodies the contradictions of
Euro-American capitalist fantasies]{.underline}**.34 As Erin Suzuki
aptly observes, "There is not just one transpacific, but **[multiple
transpacifics]{.underline}** that **[conflict, intersect, and
overlap]{.underline}**."35 Furthermore, as Yoneyama reminds us,
"**[transpacific]{.underline}**" as a critical methodology "**[must mean
more than the resignification of movements and interfaces across and
within the arena that happens to be called the Pacific]{.underline}**";
and **[we should "clarify the specific geo-historic conditions under
which that space has been constituted as an object of knowledge and
nonknowledge]{.underline}**." **[Critical interventions]{.underline}**
in the US-led Pacific geo-economic imagination and military maneuvers
laid the foundation of Asia/Pacific studies that **[sought to counter
these hegemonic discourses by drawing on the rich cultural resources and
vibrant political activisms of the Asian/Pacific communities against
capitalist, colonial, and imperialist domination]{.underline}**.
Importantly, Rob Wilson and Arif Dirlik illuminate the often-overlooked
"**[cultural micropolitics of the region as a source of dynamic
opposition and local difference worthy of international
recognition.]{.underline}**"36 Their **[emphasis on]{.underline}** the
"**[local" signifies a critical reorientation from the view of capital
and empire toward the lifeworlds of local communities.]{.underline}**
Along with Elaine Kim and Chungmoo Choi's feminist critiques of the
transwar, **[transpacific connections among Japanese colonialism, US
Cold War military-security imperialism, and postindependence Korean
nationalism, their work marks important points of departure for what we
now call transpacific studies.]{.underline}** Recent works take the
transpacific beyond the geopolitical spatial imaginary to consider it a
figure of unequal exchange and a state of transition and change to
suggest new modes of comparison and address the politics of relation.37
Yet, despite the attention to conflicts, intersections, overlaps, and
asymmetrical exchange and transformation, the transpacific has often
been faulted for omitting or occluding the peoples, histories, and
lifeworlds of the Pacific to the extent that its focus on Asian
immigration occludes indigenous struggles. Engaging the rich scholarship
on indigenous Pacific, the Hawai'i-based scholars Candace Fujikane and
Jonathan Okamura's call to address and redress the history of Asian
settler colonialism in the Pacific presents a crucial intervention in
this respect.38 Elaborating on a similar critique in the context of
Chinese diaspora, Shu-mei Shih argues that "settler colonialism was the
dark underside of the so-called diaspora of imperial subjects," and
problematizing diaspora in this way enables the exposure of "the
narcissism of those settler subjects who try to pass as diasporic
subjects.39 This critique allows us to reconceive Taiwan and Okinawa,
alongside Hawai'i and the Marshall Islands, as indigenous Pacific \[End
Page 451\] frontiers and borderlands, to recenter settler colonial
violence to complicate liberatory imagination couched in a singular
nation-state, and to grapple with the elision of indigeneity in the
processes of the latter's resistance to empires.40 **[From colonial
scramble, human rights violation, nuclear threat, ecological crisis,
ideological co-optation, and neoliberalist endgame, the violent
conditions today are driving the world to the end as we know it: the
wane of Pax Americana and neoliberal order against the global populist
redux, and the world as the end of our critical
endeavors]{.underline}**. Within this context, **[America, or China, is
but a portal for]{.underline}** planetary **[thinking beyond security
and development speaks]{.underline}**. **[It is toward the contestations
of and struggles with]{.underline}** dirty and inconvenient **[truths
of]{.underline}** these violent **[conditions that our special issue
hopes to reorient the transpacific away from the rigid US--China
dya]{.underline}**d, specifically **[by grappling with what the
triangulation and entanglement of indigenous, imperial, and settler
colonial problematics would make possible.]{.underline}**

### 2nc nuclear winter

#### No risk of nuclear winter from limited exchange- their studies assume all the black carbon reaches the upper troposphere

Alamos National Laboratory. 2-1-2018. "Climate Impact of a Regional
Nuclear Weapons Exchange: An Improved Assessment BasedOn Detailed Source

**[We present a multiscale study examining the impact of a regional
exchange of nuclear weapons on global climate]{.underline}**. Our models
investigate multiple phases of the effects of nuclear weapons usage,
**[including growth and rise of the nuclear fireball, ignition and
spread of the induced firestorm, and comprehensive Earth system modeling
of the oceans, land, ice, and atmosphere]{.underline}**. This study
follows from the scenario originally envisioned by Robock, Oman,
Stenchikov, et al. (2007, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-7-2003-2007),based
on the analysis of Toon et al. (2007,
https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-7-1973-2007), which assumes a regional
exchange between India and Pakistan of fifty 15 kt weapons detonated by
each side. **[We expand this scenario by modeling the processes that
lead to production of black carbon]{.underline}**, in order to refine
the black carbon forcing estimates of these previous studies. **[When
the Earth system model is initiated with 5 × 10^9^ kg of black carbon in
the upper troposphere]{.underline}** (approximately from 9 to 13 km),
**[the impact on climate variables]{.underline}** such as global
temperature and precipitation in our simulations **[is similar to that
predicted by previously published work. However]{.underline}**, while
our thorough simulations of the firestorm produce about 3.7 × 10^9^ kg
of black carbon, **[we find that the vast majority of the black carbon
never reaches an altitude above weather
systems]{.underline}**(approximately 12 km). Therefore, our Earth system
model simulations conducted with model-informed atmospheric
distributions of black carbon produce significantly lower global
climatic impacts than assessed in prior studies, **[as the carbon at
lower altitudes is more quickly removed from the
atmosphere.]{.underline}** In addition, **[our model ensembles indicate
that statistically significant effects on global surface temperatures
are limited to the first 5 years and are much smaller in magnitude than
those shown in earlier works]{.underline}**. None of the simulations
produced a nuclear winter effect. We find that **[the effects on global
surface temperatures are not uniform and are concentrated primarily
around the highest arctic latitudes, dramatically reducing the global
impact]{.underline}** on human health and agriculture compared with that
reported by earlier studies. Our analysis demonstrates that **[the
probability of significant global cooling from a limited exchange
scenario as envisioned in previous studies is highly
unlikely,]{.underline}** a conclusion supported by examination of
natural analogs,such as large forestfires and volcanic eruptions

### 2nc nuclear winter- counterforce

#### Only strikes on cities cause extinction

Stuart **Armstrong 12** {James Martin Research Fellow, Future of
Humanity Institute, University of Oxford, 3/16/12, "Old threats never
die, they fade away from our minds: nuclear winter,"
http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2012/03/old-threats-never-die-they-fade-away-from-our-minds-nuclear-winter/}//JM

In 1983, scientists published a paper on nuclear winter. This boosted
the death toll of all-out nuclear war from 'only' 200-500 million to the
very real possibility of the complete extinction of the human race\*.
But some argued the report was alarmist, and there did seem to be some
issues with the assumptions. So -- a military phenomena that might cause
megadeaths, possibly true but requiring further study, and a huge
research defense budget that could be used to look into this critical
phenomena and that was already spending millions on all aspects of
nuclear weapons -- can you guess what happened next? Correct -- the
issue was ignored for decades. For over twenty years, there were but a
tiny handful of papers on the most likely way we could end our own
existence, and a vague and persistent sense that nuclear winter had been
'disproved'. But in 2007, we finally had a proper followup -- **[with
the help of modern computers, better models and better observations,
what can we now say]{.underline}**? Well, that **[nuclear winter is
still a major threat;]{.underline}** the initial fear was right. Their
most likely scenario was: **[A global average surface cooling of --7°C
to --8°C persists for years, and after a decade the cooling is still
--4°C]{.underline}** \[...\]. Considering that **[the global average
cooling at the depth of the last ice age 18,000 yr ago was about --5°C,
this would be a climate change unprecedented]{.underline}** in speed and
amplitude in the history of the human race. The temperature changes are
largest over land \[...\] **[Cooling of more than --20°C occurs over
large areas of North America and of more than --30°C over much of
Eurasia, including all agricultural regions.]{.underline}** Also,
**[precipitation would be cut in half and we'd lose most of the ozone
layer]{.underline}**. But there was a more worrying development: it also
seems that a small-scale nuclear war could generate its own mini nuclear
winter. It's important to understand that **[nuclear winter would not be
a direct consequences of the nuclear explosions, but of the burning of
our cities in the wake of the war (given enough heat, even roads and
pavements will burn), generating clouds of very black smoke that rise
into the stratosphere. The clouds do need to reach these heights: any
lower and they'll get rained out.]{.underline}** This is what happened
during the burning of the Kuwaiti oil wells in 1991: Carl Sagan, one of
the fathers of the theory, predicted a nuclear winter-like scenario. But
he wasn't paying attention to the climate models: as they predicted, the
local damage was severe, but the smoke didn't reach the stratosphere,
and global damage was avoided.

### 2nc nuclear winter- at famine

#### No famine impact

David **Denkenberger et al. 17** {International Journal of Disaster Risk
Reduction, Global Catastrophic Risk Institute. 1-5-2017. "Feeding
Everyone if the Sun is Obscured and Industry is ~~Disabled~~ \[Shut
Down\]."

**[For combined sun blocking and industrial failure scenarios, the
reduced output of conventional agriculture would present a threat of
causing mass starvation. This study showed]{.underline}** that **[one
solution]{.underline}** in the short term **[is extracting edible
calories from killed leaves using distributed mechanical processes. Then
a constrained food web could be formed where]{.underline}** part of
**[the remainder]{.underline}** from this **[could be fed to chickens,
and the rest coupled with leaf litter could have mushrooms grown on it.
A second]{.underline}** group of **[solution]{.underline}**s is
**[growing mushrooms on dead trees and the residue going to cellulose
digesting animals]{.underline}** such as cattle and rabbits. Typically,
in these catastrophes the sun is not blocked completely, so **[some
agriculture would be possible based off of existing farming in extreme
environments]{.underline}** (e.g. **[growing UV and cold tolerant crops
in the tropics]{.underline}**). Furthermore, **[the cooling climate
would cool the upper layer of the ocean, causing upwelling of
nutrient-rich deep ocean water]{.underline}**. This would facilitate
algae growth in the ocean, feeding fish; **[retrofitting of ships to be
sail powered could enable significant fishing]{.underline}**. The
results of this study show **[these solutions could enable the feeding
of everyone given minimal preparation]{.underline}**, and this
preparation should be a high priority now.

### 2nc nuclear winter- at meltdowns

#### No meltdown impact

Tiffany **Kaiser 11** {Writer for Daily Tech, citing Nuclear Regulatory
Commission Report. 8-2-2011. \"NRC: Far Fewer People Would Die in a U.S.
Nuclear Meltdown Than Previously Thought,\"
http://www.dailytech.com/NRC+Far+Fewer+People+Would+Die+in+a+US+Nuclear+Meltdown+Than+Previously+Thought/article22330.htm}//JM

The nuclear crisis at Fukushima Daiichi in Japan has caused a nuclear
frenzy where leaders around the world are questioning the safety of
their plants. For instance, French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for
global nuclear review after visiting Japan, and U.S. senators demanded
that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) repeat an expensive
inspection of the country\'s nuclear power. But now, **[the NRC is close
to completing a large nuclear study that may ease a few worried
minds]{.underline}**. The NRC has been working with Sandia National
Laboratories (a Department of Energy lab) on a **[study that revises
previous projections of how quickly and how much cesium 137, which is a
radioactive material made when uranium is split, could release from a
plant after a nuclear core meltdown]{.underline}**. The NRC has been
working on the study for six years, and it will not be completely
finished until next spring. But the nuclear watchdog group, Union of
Concerned Scientists, has **[obtained an early copy of the report
through a Freedom of Information Act request]{.underline}**. The new
study is based on how much and how quickly cesium 137 could escape an
American nuclear plant if a total blackout were to occur**[. A total
blackout means complete loss of power from the grid, and backup diesel
generators and batteries have failed as well. This leads to a nuclear
meltdown]{.underline}**. NRC scientists said that **[a total blackout
would be rare]{.underline}** at an American plant, but it is better to
be safe than sorry. In addition, the NRC wanted to update previous
projections related to cesium 137. The NRC focused on two different
types of reactors in the U.S.: the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station in
Pennsylvania, which has boiling-water reactors like Fukushima Daiichi,
and the Surry Power Station in Virginia, which has pressurized-water
reactors**[. Over 100 different plants were studied. Through computer
models and engineering analyses, the NRC has concluded that the meltdown
of a typical American reactor would lead to \"far fewer deaths\" than
previously thought.]{.underline}** According to the new study, **[only 1
to 2 percent of a reactor core\'s cesium 137 could escape during a total
blackout]{.underline}**. Previous **[NRC estimates concluded that 60
percent of the cesium inventory could escape]{.underline}**. In
addition, the new study found that one person in every 4,348 within a
10-mile radius of a nuclear meltdown would develop a \"latent cancer\"
from radiation exposure. In previous estimates, it was one person in
every 167. The NRC said that **[large releases of radioactive material
would not be \"immediate,\" meaning that people within a 10-mile radius
would have plenty of time to evacuate the premises]{.underline}**. It
concluded that **[the chance of death from acute radiation exposure
within a 10-mile radius would be near zero,]{.underline}** but some
would be exposed to high enough doses to experience fatal cancers
decades later. \"Accidents progress more slowly, in some cases much more
slowly, than previously assumed,\" said Charles G. Tinkler, a senior
adviser for research on severe accidents and an author of the study.
\"Releases are smaller, and in some cases much smaller, of certain key
radioactive materials.\"

### 2nc counterforce- at no surrender

#### We could initiate a strike in 22 minutes- it would force a surrender

Strike Policy; Be Afraid."
https://www.billtrack50.com/blog/in-the-news/u-s-nuclear-first-strike-policy-be-afraid/}//JM

For example, if Russia launched a nuclear weapon, the US has the 30
minute flight time of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to
assess their desire to "launch under attack". **[The many different
steps in the notification process take up about 22]{.underline}** of the
30 **[minutes; like the time it takes for the missiles to break through
clouds, detection of the launch, transmitting different messages,
informing the president and authenticating orders to
launch.]{.underline}** All of this effectively gives the president eight
minutes to decide to whether or not to blow up the world. The second
situation is a preemptive strike --- a **[first-strike attack with
nuclear weapons carried out to destroy an enemy's capacity to
respond.]{.underline}** Preemptive strikes can be based on the
assumption that the enemy is planning an imminent attack, but don't have
to be. **[The methodology behind a preemptive nuclear strike is to
attack the enemy's strategic nuclear weapon facilities (missile silos,
submarine bases, bomber airfields),]{.underline}** command and control
sites and storage depots first. **[By hitting these targets first the
enemy will be so wounded with so little of their resources left that
they will be forced to surrender with minimal damage to the attacking
party.]{.underline}**
