#### Their arguments about bringing relief of \[[INSERT WHAT AFF SOLVES FOR]{.mark}\] creates [cruel optimism]{.underline} -- they create a trick of time for black folk that forces them to invest in the pursuit of our own death because it crowds out all non-politically recognizable alternatives -- ignoring the ontological state of blackness and reinstate the libidinal economy

**[[The politics of hope]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then,
**[[constitutes]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Lauren Berlant would call
"**[[cruel optimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" for blacks (Berlant 2011).
[[It]{.mark} bundles certain [promises]{.mark} about [redress, equality,
freedom, justice, and progress into a political object that always lies
beyond reach]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The objective of the Political is
to keep blacks in]{.underline}]{.mark} [a relation to this political
object]{.underline}---**[in an [unending pursuit of
it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[This]{.mark} pursuit]{.underline}, however,
[[is detrimental because it strengthens the very anti-black system that
would **pulverize black being**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The pursuit of
the object certainly has an "irrational" aspect to it]{.underline}, as
Farred details, but it is not mere means without expectation; instead,
it is a means that undermines the attainment of the impossible object
desired. In other words, the pursuit marks a cruel attachment to the
means of subjugation and the continued widening of the gap between
historical reality and fantastical ideal. [Black nihilism is a
"demythifying" practice, **in the Nietzschean vein**]{.underline}, [that
uncovers the subjugating strategies of political hope and de-idealizes
its fantastical object. Once we denude political hope of its axiological
and ethical veneer]{.underline}, [we see that it operates through
certain strategies]{.underline}: 1) **[positing itself as the only
alternative]{.underline}** to the problem of anti-blackness, 2)
**[shielding this alternative from rigorous]{.underline}**
historical/philosophical **[critique by placing it in an unknown
future]{.underline}**, 3) **[delimiting the field of action to include
only activity]{.underline}** recognized and **[[legitimated by the
Political, and]{.underline}]{.mark}** 4) **[[demonizing
critiques]{.underline}]{.mark}** or different philosophical
perspectives. [[The **politics of hope** masks a particular cruelty
under the auspices of "happiness" and "life." **It terrifies with the
dread of "no alternative**]{.underline}." "[Life" itself needs the
**security of the alternative**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, through this
logic, [life becomes untenable without it]{.underline}. [Political hope
promises to provide this alternative]{.underline}---a discursive and
political organization beyond extant structures of violence and
destruction. The construction of the binary "alternative/no-alternative"
ensures the hegemony and dominance of political hope within the
onto-existential horizon. [The terror of the "no
alternative"]{.underline}---the ultimate space of decay, suffering, and
death---[depends on two additional binaries]{.underline}:
"problem/solution" and "action/inaction." [According to this politics,
all problems have solutions]{.underline}, and hope provides the
accessibility and realization of these solutions. [The solution
establishes itself as the elimination of "the problem"; the
solution]{.underline}, in fact, [transcends the problem and
realizes]{.underline} Hegel's aufheben in [its constant attempt to
sublate the dirtiness of the "problem" with the pristine being of the
solution. No problem is outside the reach of hope's
solution]{.underline}---every problem is connected to the kernel of its
own eradication. [[The politics of hope must actively refuse the
possibility that the "solution" is]{.underline},]{.mark} in fact,
[another problem in disguised form; the idea of a "solution" is [nothing
more than the **repetition and disavowal of the problem
itself**.]{.mark} [The solution relies on]{.mark} what we might call the
["trick of time"]{.mark} to fortify itself from the deconstruction of
its binary]{.underline}. Because the temporality of hope is a time
"not-yet-realized," [a future tense unmoored from present-tense
justifications and pragmatist evidence, the politics of hope cleverly
shields its "solutions" from critiques of impossibility or
repetition]{.underline}. [Each insistence that these solutions stand up
against the lessons of history or the rigors of analysis is met with the
rationale that these solutions are not subject to history or analysis
because they do not reside within the horizon of the "past" or
"present."]{.underline} Put differently, [we [can never ascertain the
efficacy of the proposed solutions because **they escape the temporality
of the moment, always retreating to a "not-yet" and "could-be"
temporality**]{.mark}**. This "trick" of time offers a promise of
possibility that can only be realized in an indefinite
future**]{.underline}, and this promise is a bond of uncertainty that
can never be redeemed, only imagined. In this sense, the politics of
hope is an instance of the psychoanalytic notion of desire: [its sole
purpose is to reproduce its very condition of possibility, never to
satiate or bring fulfillment]{.underline}. [This politics secures its
hegemony through time by claiming the future as its unassailable
property and excluding (and devaluing) any other conception of time that
challenges this temporal ordering. The politics of hope]{.underline},
then, [depends on the incessant (re)production and proliferation of
problems to justify its existence]{.underline}. [Solutions cannot really
exist within the politics of hope, just the illusion of a different
order in a future tense.]{.underline} The "trick" of time and political
solution converge on the site of "action." [In critiquing the politics
of hope, one encounters the rejoinder of the dangers of
inaction]{.underline}. [**"[But we can't just do nothing! We have to do
something]{.mark}**[."]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The]{.mark} field of
permissible action is delimited and an unrelenting binary [between
action/inaction **silences critical engagement with political
hope**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These exclusionary operations rigorously
reinforce the binary between action and inaction and discredit certain
forms of engagement, critique, and protest]{.underline}. **[[Legitimate
action takes place in the political]{.underline}]{.mark}**---the
political not only claims futurity but also action as its property[. [To
"do something" means that this doing must **translate into recognizable
political activity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[;]{.mark} ["something" is a
stand-in for the word "politics"---one must "**do politics**" to address
any problem. **[A refusal to "do politics" is equivalent to "doing
nothing]{.mark}"**]{.underline}---th[is nothingness is constructed as
the antithesis of life, possibility, time, ethics, and
morality]{.underline} (a "zero-state" as Julia Kristeva \[1982\] might
call it). **[Black nihilism rejects this "trick of time"]{.underline}**
and the lure of emancipatory solutions[. **To refuse to "do politics"
and to reject the fantastical object of politics is the only "hope" for
blackness in an anti-black world**]{.underline}.

#### The alternative is to reject the affirmative as an act of burning down the civil society that produces violence against the slave. Freedom is an illusion created by the shackles of civil society and abandoning the pursuit for equality is the only way to break down the way that whiteness maintains itself.

[What is to be done? Two hundred years ago, [when the slaves in Haiti
rose up, they]{.mark}, of necessity, [burned
everything]{.mark}]{.underline}: They burned San Domingo flat so that at
the end of the war it was a charred desert. Why do you burn everything?
asked a French officer of a prisoner. We have a right to burn what we
cultivate because a man has a right to dispose of his own labour, was
the reply of this unknown anarchist.48 [[The slaves burned everything
because everything was against them]{.mark}. Everything was against the
slaves, the entire order that it was their lot to follow, the entire
order in which they were positioned as worse than senseless things,
every plantation, everything.]{.underline}49 **[["Leave nothing white
behind you,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** said Toussaint to those dedicated to
the end of white-overblack. 50 "God gave Noah the rainbow sign. No more
water, the fire next time."51 The slaves burned everything, yes, but,
unfortunately, they only burned everything in Haiti.52 [[Theirs was the
greatest and most successful revolution in the history of the
world]{.mark} but the failure of their fire to cross the waters was the
great tragedy of the Nineteenth century**.**]{.underline}53 At the dawn
of the Twentieth century, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote, "The colorline belts the
world."54 Du Bois said that the problem of the Twentieth century was the
problem of the colorline.55 The problem, now, at the dawn of the
Twenty-first century is the problem of the colorline. The colorline
continues to belt the world. Indeed, [the slave power that is
[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates now [threatens a]{.mark}n
entire [world with the death that it has become and so the
slaves]{.mark} of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, those with nothing but
their chains to lose, [must]{.mark}, if they would be free, if they
would escape slavery, [win the entire world]{.mark}.]{.underline} win
the entire world. VIII. TRAINING We begin as children. We are called and
we become our response to the call. Slaves are not called. What becomes
of them? What becomes of the broken-hearted? The slaves are divided
souls, they are brokenhearted, the slaves are split asunder by what they
are called upon to become. The slaves are called upon to become objects
but objecthood is not a calling. The slave, then, during its loneliest
loneliness, is divided from itself. This is schizophrenia. The slaves
are not called, or, rather, the slaves are called to not be. [The slaves
are called unfree and thus the living can never be and so the slaves
burst apart and die. The [slaves begin as death]{.mark}, not as
children, and [death is]{.mark} not a beginning but [an end. There is no
progress and no exit from the]{.mark} undiscovered country of the
[slave]{.mark}, or so it seems. [We are trained to think through a
progress narrative]{.mark}, a grand narrative, the grandest narrative[,
that takes us up from slavery. There is no up from
slavery.]{.mark}]{.underline} The progress from white-over-black to
white-over-black to white-overblack. The progress of slavery runs in the
opposite direction of the past-present- future timeline. [[The slave
only becomes the perfect slave at the end of the timeline]{.mark}, only
[under conditions of total juridical freedom.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is
only under conditions of freedom, of bourgeois legality, that the slave
can perfect itself as a slave by freely choosing to bow down before its
master. The slave perfects itself as a slave by offering a prayer for
equal rights. [[The system of marks is a plantation]{.mark}. The system
of property is a plantation. The system of law is a plantation. These
plantations, all part of the same system, hierarchy, produce
white-overblack, white-over-black only, and that
continually.]{.underline} The slave perfects itself as a slave through
its prayers for equal rights. [The plantation system will not commit
suicide and the slave, as stated above, has knowing non-knowledge of
this fact. **[The slave finds its way back from the undiscovered country
only by burning down every plantation.]{.mark}**]{.underline} When the
slave prays for equal rights it makes the free choice to be dead, and it
makes the free choice to not be.

### 1NC -- Long Version 

#### Racial realism ignores the systemic coding of race in the framework of social, political, legal, and economic institutions -- IR itself functions off the marginalization of people of color.

[Highlighting race in [IR may imply that race is a real biological
category]{.mark}; thus, we must state at the outset that we believe
race, like gender, [to be a socially]{.mark} [constructed category that
has no biological or cultural fixity]{.mark} to it]{.underline}.4
[However]{.underline}, we also believe that [racial formations and
racialized groups are "real," acquiring social meaning through a variety
of social, legal, political and economic forces, and institutions;
through "performative acts"; and through their intersections with
gender, class, sexuality, nation, religion, and so on]{.underline}
(Chowdhry 2008).

While the discipline of IR has flirted with the analysis of race mainly
through postcolonial writing, [[the relationship of conventional IR to
race resonates]{.mark} well [with the claims of racial realism]{.mark},
also referred to as the colorblind position popular in discussions of
"race relations"]{.underline} today.5 Although [racial
realists]{.underline} come in many hues, they agree on some assumptions
about race and racism (D\'souza 1995; Sleeper 1997; Thernstrom and
Thernstrom 1997; Jacoby 1998; Steele 1999). First[, [they believe that
the civil rights revolution in the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [replaced the prejudices and cruel
discrimination]{.mark} of an earlier era by a colorblind ethic in which
race does not matter]{.underline}. Second, they suggest that it is the
cultural shortcomings of communities of color that account for their
failures. Third, they believe that race-conscious policies promoted by
political opportunists who are trying to benefit from "identity
politics" exacerbate racial divisions. Based on the above reasoning[,
[racial realists suggest that as race is not]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [natural
or biological category]{.mark}, [we should ignore race as an analytical
category altogether]{.mark}. "For them [color-blindness is not simply a
legal standard]{.mark}; it is a particular kind of social order, one
where racial identity is irrelevant" (Brown et al. 2005:7). [By focusing
on the alleged decline of individual racism]{.mark}, **[they choose to
ignore the systemic coding of race in the framework of social,
political, legal, and economic institutions]{.mark} and in "the habits
of mind and received truths" of Americans**]{.underline} (Brown et al.
2005:4; see also Bonilla-Silva 2006).

**Blackness is ontological -- it is the thing that is able to graft
coherence to other reference points by being in antagonism to it**

INTRODUCTION\", Introduction, Jan 2017, racked & dispatched\]//Raunak

[[After]{.mark} the "nonevent of [emancipation]{.mark},"]{.underline}[4
[slavery did not]{.underline} ]{.mark}[simply [give way to
freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, the [legal disavowal of ownership
reorganized domination and [the former slave became the]{.mark}
[racialized Black "subject," whose position was marked
epidermally]{.mark},]{.underline} per Frantz Fanon.5 What followed was a
profound entrenchment of the concept of race, both psychically and
juridically. Formally, [the Black subject was no longer a slave,
but]{.underline} introduction 9 [the same formative relation of
structural violence that maintained slavery
remained]{.underline}---upheld explicitly by the police (former slave
catchers) and white supremacy generally---hence [[preserving the
equation that Black equals socially dead]{.underline}]{.mark}. Just as
wanton violence was a constituent element of slavery, so it is to
Blackness. [[Given the ongoing accumulation of Black death at the hands
of the police]{.mark}---even [despite increased visibility]{.mark} in
recent years---it becomes apparent that a Black person on the street
today faces open vulnerability to violence just as the slave did on the
plantation]{.underline}. That [there has recently been such an increase
in media coverage and yet little decrease in murder [reveals the ease
with which anti-Black violence can be ignored]{.mark} by white society;
[at the same time]{.mark} this [reveals that when one is Black one
needn't do anything to be targeted]{.mark}, as [Blackness itself is
criminalized]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With this understanding of slavery
and Blackness, Afro-pessimism makes a critical shift in focus by moving
away from the Black/ white binary and reframing it as
Black/non-Black]{.underline}, in order [to deemphasize the status of
whiteness and to center analysis]{.underline}, rather, [on the
anti-Black foundations of race and modern society]{.underline}. In other
words, "[it is racial blackness as a necessary condition for enslavement
that matters most, rather than whiteness as a sufficient condition for
freedom]{.underline}."6 As a result, it is Blackness, and more speci
cally [[anti-Blackness]{.underline}]{.mark}, that [[gives coherence to
categories of non-Black]{.mark}---white, worker, gay, i.e., "human."
[Categories of non-Black must establish their boundaries for inclusion
in a group (humanity) by having a recognizable self
within]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [There must]{.underline} also,
consequently, [be an outside to each group,]{.underline} and, as with
the concept of humanity, [[it is Blackness that is without;]{.mark} it
is Blackness that is the dark matter surrounding and holding together
the categories of non-Black.]{.underline} Experientially, subjects, even
Black ones, can obviously find themselves with any myriad identities,
but [[ontologically Blackness is still violently excluded from even the
meager scraps given when recognized]{.mark}.]{.underline}

At first glance, the field of IR has hardly any parallels to the racial
realism/colorblindness discussed above. Conventional IR do not claim any
position on race, much less a colorblind position; indeed there is a
"well-trained silence" around issues of race (Persaud 2002:58). However,
much like the ontological maneuvers of racial realists that lead them to
their objectivity claims[, the well-trained silence of IR emerges from
epistemological and ontological maneuvers in the discipline that
replicate the colorblind position that we refer to]{.underline}. We
suggest that while there is an alleged colorblindness to the discipline,
[issues of race and gender are systemically coded into some of the
concepts such as the nation-state and sovereignty that are central to
the discipline.]{.underline} Arguably, the focus of conventional IR on
nation-states depends upon neither the inclusion nor the exclusion of
race or racialized subjects. However, [the centrality of the Westphalian
state and the principle of sovereignty as the constitutive pillars of
disciplinary authority and legitimacy in IR lead to several racialized
inclusions and exclusions.]{.underline}

Karena Shaw (2002) and Sankaran Krishna (2001), amongst others, discuss
the ways in which the nation-state and sovereignty determine these
inclusions and exclusions. Shaw examines the constitution and
legitimation of disciplinary authority in IR by focusing on the
exclusion of indigenous peoples from IR. For Shaw, the "[preconditions
established by the assumption of sovereignty as the grounds of analyses"
in IR "provides the basic tension that any attempt to include indigenous
peoples in disciplinary conversations must negotiate]{.underline}" (Shaw
2002:64). Acknowledging that the focus on sovereignty excludes yet to be
decolonized indigenous peoples from the disciplinary boundaries, she
also suggests that the efforts of scholars such as Franke Wilmer (1993)
and Neta Crawford (1994) to seek inclusion of native voices in IR based
on the terms of sovereignty limit their analysis. According to Shaw,
Wilmer\'s analysis on how indigenous voices are moving towards inclusion
in IR does not take into account the fact that indigenous peoples "have
not been incidental frills at the edges of but have always been central
to IR---both as a discipline and as practices of politics among nations"
(Shaw 2002:68). For example, Shaw suggests that the role of
international law, primarily through the doctrine of terra nullius, in
the violence and dispossessions enacted upon indigenous peoples remind
us of how racialized difference was used in the theft of land and to
deny sovereignty to indigenous nations. In addition, she reminds us that
"**[the active marginalization of indigenous peoples has been necessary
for IR to appear and function]{.underline}**" (Shaw 2002:68).

Another example of the ways in which the sovereignty abstraction of IR
erases significant histories is provided by Krishna (2001). Remarking on
the horrendous violence engendered by European powers during the
misnamed Hundred Years of Peace (1815--1914), Krishna suggests the claim
of peace for the period between 1815 and 1914 could only be made by
relying on the abstraction of sovereignty. As the colonized were not
perceived as sovereign entities, the violence against them during their
occupation did not merit an accounting in the peace narrative. In
addition to these claims of Krishna, it is important to note that the
racialized and gendered construction of Africa, Asia, and the Americas
as barbaric and uncivilized played an equally important role in the
ontological maneuvers of the sovereignty narrative. Colonization became
mission civilisatrice and references to the white man\'s burden
exorcised any repugnance for the inhumane practices associated with it.

The history of the sovereign modern state in Europe is thus deeply
embedded in the history of the imperial project of Europe. While most
accounts of the history of modernity including the modern state claim a
linear chronology, beginning with its origins in Europe and then its
dissemination to the rest of the world, postcolonial scholars suggest
the mutual constitution of the "West and the rest" in which the nation
state and its identity emerge in the context of the "imperial social
formation."6 The state-centeredness of the sovereignty narrative rests
on the assumption of an anarchical world in which sovereign nation
states negotiate their interests, sovereignty being the alleged
equalizing concept in IR. In this narrative, the sovereign state is thus
projected as the universal and highest form of authority in the
anarchical world system dissimilating its Eurocentric, hierarchical and
violent origins. "Indeed, reflection on the past 300 or so years---since
Westphalia---indicates that the dominant political form has in any case
been the imperial state and empire rather than the sovereign state"
(Laffey and Weldes 2004:125).

#### The libidinal economy is the best explanation for antiblack violence and creates the conditions for \[[INSERT AFF IMPACTS]{.mark}\]

**Chico et al 11 **(A Primer on \"Libidinal Economy\" in Relation to
Black Folks.  Cosmic Hoboes: An Afropessimist Meditation

People who are interested in struggle need to understand the \"libidinal
economy.\" Coalition politicos like Al Sharpton like to tell us to put
the unique experiences of black folks in the backseat to the interests
of poor folks more generally. Such [politicians expect]{.underline} us
to submerge our interests as black people on the assumption that [if
poor people ]{.underline}in general **[[benefit from a political
concession]{.underline}]{.mark}**, poor [black people
will share equally in suchbenefits. Such politicos ]{.underline}will
[continue to [ignore]{.mark} the **[repeated
evidence]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} a lot of [nonblack people hate black
people]{.mark}, [**even if**doing so costs them]{.mark} money. If
someone tells you that the problems black folks face are really just the
problems that poor people face, they are telling you to ignore
the **libidinal
economy**. [They]{.mark} are [tell]{.mark}ing [you]{.mark} that [the
political economy]{.mark} of capitalism [is **more important** than the
libidinal economy]{.mark}]{.underline}[ ]{.mark}of antiblack
racism. What is \"libidinal economy\"? In Red, White, and Black: Cinema
and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms (2010, Duke University Press),
black political theorist Frank Wilderson highlights the distinction
between political economy and libidinal economy (p. 9): Jared Sexton
describes libidinal economy as "the economy, or distribution and
arrangement, of desire and identification (their condensation and
displacement), and the complex relationship between sexuality and the
unconscious." Needless to say,libidinal economy functions
variously **[across scales]{.underline}** and **[is as "objective" as
political economy]{.underline}**. Importantly, it is linked not only to
forms of attraction, affection and alliance, but also to aggression,
destruction, and the violence of lethal consumption. He emphasizes
that it is "the whole structure of psychic and emotional
life," something more than, but inclusive of or traversed by, what
Gramsci and other marxists call a "structure of feeling"; it is "a
dispensation of energies, concerns, points of attention, anxieties,
pleasures, appetites, revulsions, and phobias capable of both great
mobility and tenacious fixation." What does all this mean? Let\'s
interpret this elaborate definition and get to how it thinks of
\"economy.\" When we think of economy, we usually think of something
having to do with money. Wilderson uses the term political economy to
refer to economy in the ways that we usually think of it: the ways
people exchange materials and decide on how things are valued. Economy
doesn\'t just mean the economy in the sense of the stock market or
banks, but also any means of determining whether something is worth
doing or possessing based on how much capital and labor power it yields.
In struggle, we see over and over that money talks and bullshit
walks. Economy has to do [with [what they value **moves people to
act**]{.mark}. Economies are therefore very important to **political
action**. ]{.underline}But can there be an economy that exchanges
something other than money or capital? Yes. To understand \"economy\" as
Wilderson and Sexton use it, we have to think of economy in a more
general way as things of all kinds that we can trade or save. You can
accumulate not only cash or material items, but also fears and desires.
Certain people accumulate more fear (the black athlete) and desire (the
blonde cheerleader) than others. The term libidinal economy refers to
the systems of exchange and valuation for fantasies, desires, fears,
aversions, and enjoyment. Economy is about exchange and accumulation.
Everyone feels fear and aggression, but where is it directed? The
libidinal is about both people\'s desires, fantasies, and pleasures AND
their phobias, fears, and violent consumptions. A libidinal economy has
to do with which groups a subject is attracted to, which groups it is
willing to form alliances with, and which people it is willing to
provide affection to. Where can we see this libidinal economy? How can
we illustrate this distinction? The libido is the collection of things
like phobias and desires that are unconscious and invisible but that
have a visible effect on the world, including the money economy. Some
examples: [[We see **libidinal economies**]{.mark} at work **[any time
there is a response by state that is out
of]{.mark} all [proportion]{.mark} to the material effects of any
practice they are regulating**. [The US]{.mark}A **[incarcerates three
million]{.mark}** people, **[despite]{.mark}** the fact [that doing so
has an adverse impact on]{.mark} US [financial
security]{.mark}. Hence [the libidinal]{.mark} economy of the [fear of
black]{.mark} and brown [people]{.mark} (who together comprise the
overwhelming majority of inmates) [**trumps** the political economy
of]{.mark} the [cost-benefit analysis]{.mark} of maintaining prisons.
Let\'s [take another example of the **powder - versus
crack-cocaine** distinction]{.mark}, in which the same drug is punished
differently at the federal level. Because [the
two]{.mark} drugs [are]{.mark} **chemically [identical]{.mark}**]{.underline},
there shouldn\'t be any distinction between how their use and sale is
punished. In 2010, the law made it so that these two drugs were punished
the same, although the Obama administration isn\'t in any hurry to make
the abolition of this distinction retroactive so that the mostly black
and brown people who are locked up because of it will get released. But
the legal abolition of this distinction is not essential for us to look
at. What is essential is why that distinction was made in the first
place. Wilderson\'s work suggests that, for civil society, black people
pose a threat that has nothing to do with the chemical content or the
social and cultural effects of crack. **[Simply [by being associated
with black people, crack is seen as 100 times more
threatening]{.mark} than is powder cocaine]{.underline}**. The financial
and social costs of locking all those black and brown people up and the
financial and social costs of allowing all those white people to go free
and continue to sell does not really matter to civil society. What the
powder- versus crack-cocaine distinction shows is the desire to contain
the threat that blackness symbolizes. This is the mark of libidinal
economy. Cops, soldiers, firemen are considered sexually desirable
because they become the heroes of civil society. [The Oscar Grant
shooting. Amadou [**Diallo** was a victim]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} a [extreme]{.mark} kind of [violence because
of]{.mark} the **[phobias]{.mark}** that converged on his body. What is
the exchange?Civil society has an anxiety about crime, and crime is
always attached to black in urban areas. [Police don\'t]{.mark} have
to [get a monetary award]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} they [get the gratitude
of civil society]{.mark}. How does this play out in ways that don\'t
have to do strictly with money? The desire for them may not show up in
the amount of money they make. Cops get rewarded [for their
aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline} When the cop slammed dude into the
glass at BART. Prison guards, thought of as having the toughest beat on
the planet. They get rewarded for being the last line of defense against
George Jackson. Oscar Grant was an accumulation of aggression and
phobias. Why are the black people in Prince George\'s County, Maryland,
segregated from white people in their **[same socioeconomic
bracket]{.underline}**with the same kinds of high-value real estate, and
the same kinds of political-economic values? Living around white people
has a value that cannot be explained in strictly monetary terms. AFDC
benefited mostly white single mothers, and enjoyed a long history of
support from 1936-the 1960s. It initially excluded black people. By the
1960s, when black people started getting it, attitudes changed toward
it, making it seem like it was undeserved and a drain on national
prosperity, and by 1984, when Ronald Reagan referred to \"[[welfare
queens]{.mark} in Cadillacs,\" it was clear that AFDC [was]{.mark} [\"a
black thing.\"]{.mark} [In]{.mark}actual [statistical terms, it
was]{.mark} still [used most]{.mark}ly [by white
women]{.mark}.]{.underline} But once it became associated with poor
black women, it was seen as in need of drastic, radical reforms. But is
this \"libidinal economy\" really that important? Frank Wilderson is
using the distinction between a money economy and an economy of desire
over and over again throughout this book. Wilderson talks about this by
talking about the difference between word and deed. This is not the
hypocrisy of the system. It IS the logic of the system. So Europeans
tried to resolve the lack of labor power by passing laws that reduced
homeless white people to the status of slaves. In the end, however, they
never really enforced these laws. Wilderson quotes David Eltis, an
economic historian, who says that the costs of settling the \"new
world\" would have been significantly reduced if Europeans has simply
enslaved other Europeans. But, Wilderson points out, \"what Whites would
have gained in economic value, they would have lost in symbolic value;
and it is the \[symbolic value\] which structures the libidinal economy
of civil society.\" In other words, the symbolic costs of Europeans
enslaving other Europeans would have been too great. Instead, they went
to Africa for their slaves, even though the financial cost of doing so
was much, much greater. The radical left doesn\'t make this distinction.
Cornel West and Tavis Smiley say they want to organize a new Poor
People\'s Campaign, but they won\'t be able to explain why this is a
failed project from the start. This is because they won\'t think about
the aspects of coalition building that have nothing to do with money or
the lack of money. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the so-called
\"Reagan Democrats\" were poor and working-class white people, many of
them in unions, who voted overwhelmingly for Reagan against their own
economic interest. [[The]{.mark} white [left **mistakenly** thinks
about]{.mark} the Reagan[Democrats as **people who were
duped**]{.mark}**.** They view them as an example of what Marx called
\"false consciousness\" [and]{.mark} they [see it as their duty]{.mark}
[to **inform**]{.mark} the white poor and working class of [why they
should vote left]{.mark}. ]{.underline}But there were all kinds of signs
that white poor and working-class folks simply hated black people and
didn\'t want to live anywhere that there was a large community of black
people, even if those black people are of the same or higher
socioeconomic status. The Reagan Democrats were excited by Reagan\'s
antiblack rhetoric of law and order, a rhetoric that was in response
against the activities of the Black Liberation Army, Weather
Underground, Black Panthers, and Black Guerilla Family. Marxists think a
person is in a state of false consciousness if her political or social
interests go another way than her material or financial interests. If
you adopt this view, then you probably think that the Reagan Democrats
just need to be educated correctly about what they have in common with
the black poor and working class. You have to think that their hatred of
black people is somehow \"false\" simply because it runs counter to
their financial interests. But this would be to ignore their interest in
maintaining white supremacy and antiblack racism. One of the thingswhite
men would lose would be access to black bodies for sexual pleasure and
amusement. [[These examples
are **not**]{.mark}**just [isolated]{.mark}** [cases of]{.mark} false
consciousness, [ignorance]{.mark}, media manipulation, or some mystical
thing called \"prejudice.\"]{.underline} They are all of those things,
but they are also something much, much greater that any student of
struggle needs to be aware of. These examples reveal the contours of an
economy of desires that is not primarily concerned with money. It\'s not
that the political economy isn\'t also antiblack. In fact, both
economies are antiblack.

#### The alternative is to reject the affirmative as an act of burning down the civil society that produces violence against the slave. Freedom is an illusion created by the shackles of civil society and abandoning the pursuit for equality is the only way to break down the way that whiteness maintains itself.

unfortunately, they only burned everything in Haiti.52 [[Theirs was the

are not called, or, rather, the slaves are called to not be. [The slaves

[under conditions of total juridical freedom.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is
only under conditions of freedom, of bourgeois legality, that the slave
can perfect itself as a slave by freely choosing to bow down before its
master. The slave perfects itself as a slave by offering a prayer for
equal rights. [[The system of marks is a plantation]{.mark}. The system
of property is a plantation. The system of law is a plantation. These
plantations, all part of the same system, hierarchy, produce
white-overblack, white-over-black only, and that
continually.]{.underline} The slave perfects itself as a slave through
its prayers for equal rights. [The plantation system will not commit
suicide and the slave, as stated above, has knowing non-knowledge of
this fact. **[The slave finds its way back from the undiscovered country

slave prays for equal rights it makes the free choice to be dead, and it
makes the free choice to not be.

### 1NC -- IR

#### Racial realism ignores the systemic coding of race in the framework of social, political, legal, and economic institutions -- IR itself functions off the marginalization of people of color.

Geeta **Chowdhry** **&** Shirin M. **Rai** 20**09** -- "The Geographies
of Exclusion and the Politics of Inclusion: Race-based Exclusions in the
Teaching of International Relations" Geeta Chowdry is a professor in

[Highlighting race in [IR may imply that race is a real biological
category]{.mark}; thus, we must state at the outset that we believe
race, like gender, [to be a socially]{.mark} [constructed category that
has no biological or cultural fixity]{.mark} to it]{.underline}.4
[However]{.underline}, we also believe that [racial formations and
racialized groups are "real," acquiring social meaning through a variety
of social, legal, political and economic forces, and institutions;
through "performative acts"; and through their intersections with
gender, class, sexuality, nation, religion, and so on]{.underline}
(Chowdhry 2008).

While the discipline of IR has flirted with the analysis of race mainly
through postcolonial writing, [[the relationship of conventional IR to
race resonates]{.mark} well [with the claims of racial realism]{.mark},
also referred to as the colorblind position popular in discussions of
"race relations"]{.underline} today.5 Although [racial
realists]{.underline} come in many hues, they agree on some assumptions
about race and racism (D\'souza 1995; Sleeper 1997; Thernstrom and
Thernstrom 1997; Jacoby 1998; Steele 1999). First[, [they believe that
the civil rights revolution in the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [replaced the prejudices and cruel
discrimination]{.mark} of an earlier era by a colorblind ethic in which
race does not matter]{.underline}. Second, they suggest that it is the
cultural shortcomings of communities of color that account for their
failures. Third, they believe that race-conscious policies promoted by
political opportunists who are trying to benefit from "identity
politics" exacerbate racial divisions. Based on the above reasoning[,
[racial realists suggest that as race is not]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [natural
or biological category]{.mark}, [we should ignore race as an analytical
category altogether]{.mark}. "For them [color-blindness is not simply a
legal standard]{.mark}; it is a particular kind of social order, one
where racial identity is irrelevant" (Brown et al. 2005:7). [By focusing
on the alleged decline of individual racism]{.mark}, **[they choose to
ignore ]{.mark}**]{.underline}[**[the systemic coding of race in the
framework of social, political, legal, and economic institutions]{.mark}
and in "the habits of mind and received truths" of
Americans**]{.underline} (Brown et al. 2005:4; see also Bonilla-Silva
2006).

At first glance, the field of IR has hardly any parallels to the racial
realism/colorblindness discussed above. Conventional IR do not claim any
position on race, much less a colorblind position; indeed there is a
"well-trained silence" around issues of race (Persaud 2002:58). However,
much like the ontological maneuvers of racial realists that lead them to
their objectivity claims[, the well-trained silence of IR emerges from
epistemological and ontological maneuvers in the discipline that
replicate the colorblind position that we refer to]{.underline}. We
suggest that while there is an alleged colorblindness to the discipline,
[issues of race and gender are systemically coded into some of the
concepts such as the nation-state and sovereignty that are central to
the discipline.]{.underline} Arguably, the focus of conventional IR on
nation-states depends upon neither the inclusion nor the exclusion of
race or racialized subjects. However, [the centrality of the Westphalian
state and the principle of sovereignty as the constitutive pillars of
disciplinary authority and legitimacy in IR lead to several racialized
inclusions and exclusions.]{.underline}

Karena Shaw (2002) and Sankaran Krishna (2001), amongst others, discuss
the ways in which the nation-state and sovereignty determine these
inclusions and exclusions. Shaw examines the constitution and
legitimation of disciplinary authority in IR by focusing on the
exclusion of indigenous peoples from IR. For Shaw, the "[preconditions
established by the assumption of sovereignty as the grounds of analyses"
in IR "provides the basic tension that any attempt to include indigenous
peoples in disciplinary conversations must negotiate]{.underline}" (Shaw
2002:64). Acknowledging that the focus on sovereignty excludes yet to be
decolonized indigenous peoples from the disciplinary boundaries, she
also suggests that the efforts of scholars such as Franke Wilmer (1993)
and Neta Crawford (1994) to seek inclusion of native voices in IR based
on the terms of sovereignty limit their analysis. According to Shaw,
Wilmer\'s analysis on how indigenous voices are moving towards inclusion
in IR does not take into account the fact that indigenous peoples "have
not been incidental frills at the edges of but have always been central
to IR---both as a discipline and as practices of politics among nations"
(Shaw 2002:68). For example, Shaw suggests that the role of
international law, primarily through the doctrine of terra nullius, in
the violence and dispossessions enacted upon indigenous peoples remind
us of how racialized difference was used in the theft of land and to
deny sovereignty to indigenous nations. In addition, she reminds us that
"**[the active marginalization of indigenous peoples has been necessary
for IR to appear and function]{.underline}**" (Shaw 2002:68).

Another example of the ways in which the sovereignty abstraction of IR
erases significant histories is provided by Krishna (2001). Remarking on
the horrendous violence engendered by European powers during the
misnamed Hundred Years of Peace (1815--1914), Krishna suggests the claim
of peace for the period between 1815 and 1914 could only be made by
relying on the abstraction of sovereignty. As the colonized were not
perceived as sovereign entities, the violence against them during their
occupation did not merit an accounting in the peace narrative. In
addition to these claims of Krishna, it is important to note that the
racialized and gendered construction of Africa, Asia, and the Americas
as barbaric and uncivilized played an equally important role in the
ontological maneuvers of the sovereignty narrative. Colonization became
mission civilisatrice and references to the white man\'s burden
exorcised any repugnance for the inhumane practices associated with it.

The history of the sovereign modern state in Europe is thus deeply
embedded in the history of the imperial project of Europe. While most
accounts of the history of modernity including the modern state claim a
linear chronology, beginning with its origins in Europe and then its
dissemination to the rest of the world, postcolonial scholars suggest
the mutual constitution of the "West and the rest" in which the nation
state and its identity emerge in the context of the "imperial social
formation."6 The state-centeredness of the sovereignty narrative rests
on the assumption of an anarchical world in which sovereign nation
states negotiate their interests, sovereignty being the alleged
equalizing concept in IR. In this narrative, the sovereign state is thus
projected as the universal and highest form of authority in the
anarchical world system dissimilating its Eurocentric, hierarchical and
violent origins. "Indeed, reflection on the past 300 or so years---since
Westphalia---indicates that the dominant political form has in any case
been the imperial state and empire rather than the sovereign state"
(Laffey and Weldes 2004:125).

### 1NC -- Cruel Optimism

#### Their arguments about bringing relief of \[[INSERT WHAT AFF SOLVES FOR]{.mark}\] creates [cruel optimism]{.underline} -- they create a trick of time for black folk that forces them to invest in the pursuit of our own death because it crowds out all non-politically recognizable alternatives

**Warren 15** \[Calvin K., Assistant Professor of American Studies at

**[[The politics of hope]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then,
**[[constitutes]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Lauren Berlant would call
"**[[cruel optimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" for blacks (Berlant 2011).
[[It]{.mark} bundles certain [promises]{.mark} about [redress, equality,
freedom, justice, and progress into a political object that always lies
beyond reach]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The objective of the Political is
to keep blacks in]{.underline}]{.mark} [a relation to this political
object]{.underline}---**[in an [unending pursuit of
it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[This]{.mark} pursuit]{.underline}, however,
[[is detrimental because it strengthens the very anti-black system that
would **pulverize black being**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The pursuit of
the object certainly has an "irrational" aspect to it]{.underline}, as
Farred details, but it is not mere means without expectation; instead,
it is a means that undermines the attainment of the impossible object
desired. In other words, the pursuit marks a cruel attachment to the
means of subjugation and the continued widening of the gap between
historical reality and fantastical ideal. [Black nihilism is a
"demythifying" practice, **in the Nietzschean vein**]{.underline}, [that
uncovers the subjugating strategies of political hope and de-idealizes
its fantastical object. Once we denude political hope of its axiological
and ethical veneer]{.underline}, [we see that it operates through
certain strategies]{.underline}: 1) **[positing itself as the only
alternative]{.underline}** to the problem of anti-blackness, 2)
**[shielding this alternative from rigorous]{.underline}**
historical/philosophical **[critique by placing it in an unknown
future]{.underline}**, 3) **[delimiting the field of action to include
only activity]{.underline}** recognized and **[[legitimated by the
Political, and]{.underline}]{.mark}** 4) **[[demonizing
critiques]{.underline}]{.mark}** or different philosophical
perspectives. [[The **politics of hope** masks a particular cruelty
under the auspices of "happiness" and "life." **It terrifies with the
dread of "no alternative**]{.underline}." "[Life" itself needs the
**security of the alternative**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and, through this
logic, [life becomes untenable without it]{.underline}. [Political hope
promises to provide this alternative]{.underline}---a discursive and
political organization beyond extant structures of violence and
destruction. The construction of the binary "alternative/no-alternative"
ensures the hegemony and dominance of political hope within the
onto-existential horizon. [The terror of the "no
alternative"]{.underline}---the ultimate space of decay, suffering, and
death---[depends on two additional binaries]{.underline}:
"problem/solution" and "action/inaction." [According to this politics,
all problems have solutions]{.underline}, and hope provides the
accessibility and realization of these solutions. [The solution
establishes itself as the elimination of "the problem"; the
solution]{.underline}, in fact, [transcends the problem and
realizes]{.underline} Hegel's aufheben in [its constant attempt to
sublate the dirtiness of the "problem" with the pristine being of the
solution. No problem is outside the reach of hope's
solution]{.underline}---every problem is connected to the kernel of its
own eradication. [[The politics of hope must actively refuse the
possibility that the "solution" is]{.underline},]{.mark} in fact,
[another problem in disguised form; the idea of a "solution" is [nothing
more than the **repetition and disavowal of the problem
itself**.]{.mark} [The solution relies on]{.mark} what we might call the
["trick of time"]{.mark} to fortify itself from the deconstruction of
its binary]{.underline}. Because the temporality of hope is a time
"not-yet-realized," [a future tense unmoored from present-tense
justifications and pragmatist evidence, the politics of hope cleverly
shields its "solutions" from critiques of impossibility or
repetition]{.underline}. [Each insistence that these solutions stand up
against the lessons of history or the rigors of analysis is met with the
rationale that these solutions are not subject to history or analysis
because they do not reside within the horizon of the "past" or
"present."]{.underline} Put differently, [we [can never ascertain the
efficacy of the proposed solutions because **they escape the temporality
of the moment, always retreating to a "not-yet" and "could-be"
temporality**]{.mark}**. This "trick" of time offers a promise of
possibility that can only be realized in an indefinite
future**]{.underline}, and this promise is a bond of uncertainty that
can never be redeemed, only imagined. In this sense, the politics of
hope is an instance of the psychoanalytic notion of desire: [its sole
purpose is to reproduce its very condition of possibility, never to
satiate or bring fulfillment]{.underline}. [This politics secures its
hegemony through time by claiming the future as its unassailable
property and excluding (and devaluing) any other conception of time that
challenges this temporal ordering. The politics of hope]{.underline},
then, [depends on the incessant (re)production and proliferation of
problems to justify its existence]{.underline}. [Solutions cannot really
exist within the politics of hope, just the illusion of a different
order in a future tense.]{.underline} The "trick" of time and political
solution converge on the site of "action." [In critiquing the politics
of hope, one encounters the rejoinder of the dangers of
inaction]{.underline}. [**"[But we can't just do nothing! We have to do
something]{.mark}**[."]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The]{.mark} field of
permissible action is delimited and an unrelenting binary [between
action/inaction **silences critical engagement with political
hope**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These exclusionary operations rigorously
reinforce the binary between action and inaction and discredit certain
forms of engagement, critique, and protest]{.underline}. **[[Legitimate
action takes place in the political]{.underline}]{.mark}**---the
political not only claims futurity but also action as its property[. [To
"do something" means that this doing must **translate into recognizable
political activity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[;]{.mark} ["something" is a
stand-in for the word "politics"---one must "**do politics**" to address
any problem. **[A refusal to "do politics" is equivalent to "doing
nothing]{.mark}"**]{.underline}---th[is nothingness is constructed as
the antithesis of life, possibility, time, ethics, and
morality]{.underline} (a "zero-state" as Julia Kristeva \[1982\] might
call it). **[Black nihilism rejects this "trick of time"]{.underline}**
and the lure of emancipatory solutions[. **To refuse to "do politics"
and to reject the fantastical object of politics is the only "hope" for
blackness in an anti-black world**]{.underline}.

**Leong 16** -- PhD UC Irvine - Assistant Professor, English, University
of Utah - Assistant Professor, Environmental Humanities Graduate
Program, University of Utah (Diana, "The Mattering of Black Lives:
Octavia Butler's Hyperempathy and the Promise of the New Materialisms,"
Catalyst: Feminism, Theory, Technoscience, 2(2), 1-35)

Black lives matter and black lives matter and black lives matter. This
homographic reading of the most salient political statement of recent
years speaks to the torsions of blackness, matter, and life that have
come to define our contemporary era. In "Unbearable Blackness," Jared
Sexton (2015) argues with regard to the triangulation of these concerns
that [[antiblack fantasies]{.mark} "do not render blacks, like so much
of the planet, subject to death in an economy of disposability; rather,
they [subject blacks to]{.mark} '[the **interminable time** of]{.mark}
meaningless, **[impersonal dying]{.mark}**'"]{.underline} (p.168). In
the wake of recent grand jury decisions not to prosecute the murders of
Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, and Michael Brown, to name only the most widely
publicized cases, Sexton's claims register most strongly in the state's
refusal to allow these deaths to die. They are caught instead in a
biopolitical apparatus that suspends racial blackness between a life
unrecognized as such and an illegible form of death that can never pass
into reason. Against this timeless, spectral dying, we can read the
declaration that "Black Lives Matter" as a call to return racial
blackness to a form that matters, to a form, in other words, that is
matter. On this score, I ask: how do black life and death become matter,
and what is at stake in the demand that they should assume such form?
Octavia Butler's Afrofuturist novels Parable of the Sower (1993) and
Parable of the Talents (1998) dramatize these questions through
protagonist Lauren Olamina and her condition of hyperempathy. [In this
article, I explore [hyperempathy as]{.mark} a speculative embodiment of
"[pornotroping]{.mark}" (Spillers, 2003) to [understand how]{.mark}
racial [blackness structures]{.mark} current [theorizations of
matter]{.mark}.]{.underline} Questions about the proper scale, scope,
and character of matter have assumed a renewed sense of urgency given
the emergence of the Anthropocene, a distinct geological epoch in which
human activity has become so influential as to alter fundamental aspects
of the Earth System. While ecologist Eugene Stoermer and Nobel
Prize-winning atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen introduced the current
definition of the term in the 1980s, we have since witnessed a growing
scientific consensus about the rigor of the concept. A recent article
published in the journal Science by the Anthropocene Working Group
(2016) provides the latest example of this support, demonstrating that
fluctuations in the content and pace of sediment deposits and extinction
rates are anthropogenically driven. However, the very nomenclature of
the "Anthropocene" has been subject to critique from within the
humanities for allowing an abstract notion of the "Anthropos" to anchor
an implicit philosophy of history. Daniel Hartley (2015), for instance,
comments in a recent issue of the UK-based magazine Salvage, "Inherent
to the Anthropocene discourse is a conception of historical causality
which is purely mechanical: a one-onone billiard ball model of
technological invention and historical effect, which is simply
inadequate to explain actual social and relational modes of historical
causation" (para. 4). Hartley takes special issue with the presumed
origins of the Anthropocene, which many geologists date to the
industrial and nuclear revolutions. This determination, he suggests,
interprets the environmental impact of technology as the "net effect" of
an undifferentiated "human" activity (Waters et. al., 2016, p. 139). In
order to assert a causal link between technological development and
ecological catastrophe, any consideration of the roles race, class, and
gender have played in engineering our historical present must be
obscured.1 The benefits and consequences of technological development
and environmental disaster, after all, are rarely if ever distributed
symmetrically among and within human populations. "It is not all people
that are indicted by the onset of the Anthropocene," writes Nicholas
Mirzoeff (forthcoming 2016), "but a specific set: colonial settlers,
enslavers, and would-be imperialists" (pp. 19-20). At the same time,
this remodeling of human history and ecological philosophy is not unique
to geologists. Indeed, the Anthropocene's scientific definition may have
become matters of debate only recently, but its constitutive
concerns---global warming, genetic technology, biodiversity loss,
environmental racism---have thrown our prevailing concepts of nature and
culture into crisis well before the epoch's formal identification. At
stake is not only the fate of homo sapiens as a species, but also the
basic composition of a world yet to come. The challenges of analyzing
the effects of non-human systems (e.g., weather patterns or ocean
currents) and actors (e.g., viruses or pesticides) while attending to
the uneven distribution of environmental risks and resources have
generated a range of philosophical responses. For example, publications
like Dipesh Chakrabarty's (2009), "The Climate of History," Elizabeth
Kolbert's (2014) The Sixth Extinction, and Roy Scranton's (2015)
Learning to Die in the Anthropocene recommend a universal or existential
"species thinking" necessary for grasping the complexities of climate
change. Other responses, like Jane Bennett's (2010) Vibrant Matter and
Jeffrey Jerome Cohen's (2015) Stone, interrogate fantasies of human
mastery as a way of reckoning with the power of non-human agents. Over
the last decade, one particular variety of response has acquired
critical purchase within the academic left: the new materialisms. As
part of what Richard Grusin (2015) has named "the nonhuman turn" in
contemporary thought, the new materialisms join affect theory, critical
animal studies, and object-oriented ontology in calling for enhanced
attention to matter and materiality. The popularity of this approach,
evidenced by a growing number of monographs, special journal issues, and
anthologies, appears grounded in the need to develop strategies of
coexistence attuned to the Anthropocene's political and ecological
crises.2 How, for example, should we understand agency and embodiment in
light of recent developments in biotechnology and the increasingly
unpredictable behavior of non-human objects? The promise of the new
materialisms thus inheres in the notion that a focus on materiality can
offer us more comprehensive and efficacious ways to respond to these
developments. As Diana Coole and Samantha Frost (2010) write in their
introduction to the New Materialisms anthology, "What is at stake here
is nothing less than a challenge to some of the most basic assumptions
that have underpinned the modern world, including its normative sense of
the human and its beliefs about human agency, but also regarding its
material practices such as the ways we labor on, exploit, and interact
with nature" (p. 4). There is much to recommend an intensified
engagement with matter, not least of which is Coole and Frost's proposal
that such engagements can disrupt our "normative sense of the human" and
of "human agency." Given this professed interest in dismantling human
exceptionalism, it is curious then that, as Zakiyyah Jackson (2015) and
other critical race scholars point out, the new materialisms have
systematically "\[ignored\] praxes of humanity and critiques produced by
black people, particularly those praxes which are irreverent to the
normative production of 'the human' or illegible from within the terms
of its logic" (p. 216).3 Black thought has long challenged the enforced
description of Africans and their descendants as non-human objects of
science, as specimens for study and experimentation, as commodities for
market exchange, as things. In fact, from at least the 16th century
onward, black bodies provided crucial raw material for the development
of natural history, the natural sciences, and the life philosophies in
Enlightenment thought.4 Both geology and biology, for example, pursued
notions of species and evolution that preserved early racial taxonomies;
the techniques of observation and interpretation used to analyze
geological activity were the same as those employed by the racial
science of phrenology. Mirzoeff (forthcoming 2016) leverages this
history to argue that "the very concept of observable breaks between
geological eras in general and the definition of the Anthropocene in
particular is inextricably intermingled with the belief in distinct
races of humanity" (p. 2). His claim that the concept of the
Anthropocene reproduces race-making technologies gestures to the
historical fact that the human as such has emerged through the exclusion
and extermination of black bodies. Proscribed from the realm of the
human, black intellectuals have had to think within and through the
categories of the non-human and the inhuman to pursue new ways of being
in the world. Philosophical questions about the vitality and agency of
the human, the animal, and the object are therefore longstanding in the
fields of Black studies. Alexander Weheliye (2015) observes in Habeas
Viscus that across Sylvia Wynter's oeuvre, "it is the human---or
different genres of the human---that materializes as the object of
knowledge in the conceptual mirror of black studies" (p. 21). The
scholarly work of Hortense Spillers (2003) and Fred Moten (2003), and
the Afrofuturist contributions of Nalo Hopkinson (1998; 2000) and Nnedi
Okorafor (2010), similarly confront the "most basic assumptions that
have underpinned the modern world," including our notions of history,
temporality, and modern science.5 And yet, as it is with the
Anthropocene's implied philosophy of history, much of the scholarship
produced under the banner of the new materialisms tends to reduce race
to a crude "identity politics" or to endorse a model of
difference-withoutrace.6 This reduction and disavowal of race, I
contend, is something of a structural necessity for the new
materialisms. In what follows, I trace the general theoretical
principles of the new materialisms to a dissatisfaction with the
linguistic and cultural paradigms of post-structuralism. I then
demonstrate how this dissatisfaction enables an ethics of relation or
affect that further legitimizes the reduction and dismissal of race.
However, as a close reading of Butler's Parable duology reveals, one of
the primary figures of the new materialisms---the material body---is
defined by and through disavowed social fantasies about black female
flesh that are linked to the global legacies of modern slavery. My
examination of the critical responses to Butler's novels further
suggests that such fantasies are necessary to secure a libidinal
investment in the ethical potential of materiality. I argue, thus,
against a misrecognition of black female flesh as a resource against the
violence of hierarchical differences, rather than the site of their
active production. Finally, I turn to a reading of Butler's Parable
duology as an allegory about the dangers of proceeding in the
Anthropocene without a robust analysis of the formation of racial
blackness. Because a proper survey of new materialist literature is
beyond the scope of this article, the comments below should be taken as
entry points for probing the (absent) place of racial blackness in
theories about matter.7 The promise of the new materialisms The new
materialisms are drawn from a long genealogy of philosophical
materialism, in which Spinoza, Nietzsche, Bergson, Marx, and Deleuze are
cited as major touchstones. In recognition of this legacy, Coole and
Frost (2010) assert that the interventions loosely gathered by the term
"new materialisms" are better "categorized as renewed materialisms,"
with the qualifier "new" acknowledging the "unprecedented" ecological,
biological, and technological conditions under which we currently live
and labor (p. 4, italics in original). Although their specific objects
of analysis are appropriately diverse, the new materialisms collectively
insist on a post-humanist matter that is lively, self-directed,
agential, creative, and always in the process of becoming. In this
regard, matter is better thought of as materialization, or the process
by which complex phenomena are temporarily and contingently stabilized
to varying degrees. The ontological shift entailed here is towards a
philosophical monism, inspired most notably by the work of Deleuze.
Following Spinoza and Bergson, Deleuze (1994) develops a notion of the
virtual as a generative field of difference, or a "plane of immanence,"
where "all the varieties of differential relations and all the
distributions of singular points \[coexist\] in diverse orders
'perplicated' in one another" (p. 206). These differences are then
formatted into distinct phenomena or entities by processes of
actualization that "\[bring\] the object back into relation with the
field of differential relations in which it can always be dissolved and
become actualized otherwise, as something else, by being linked through
other differential relations to other particles" (Cheah, 2010, pp.
85-86). While not all new materialist theories cleave to a strictly
Deleuzian philosophy, there is general agreement that the dynamic
interactions among objects, bodies, and phenomena turn us away from the
Anthropocene's "billiard ball model" of causality, and more
significantly, away from some of poststructuralism's critical trends.
According to the new materialisms, the linguistic and cultural turns of
the last half century have resulted in both an intellectual and a
political poverty. Specifically, social constructivism (Coole & Frost,
2010) and cultural representationalism (Barad, 2007) have overdetermined
matter to the extent that it appears as a passive product made
meaningful only through cultural and discursive practice. Coole and
Frost (2010) even write of a theoretical "exhaustion," claiming that
they "share the feeling current among many researchers that the dominant
constructivist orientation to social analysis is inadequate for thinking
about matter, materiality, and politics in ways that do justice to the
contemporary context of biopolitics and global political economy" (p.
6). Somewhere and sometime during the rise of the Anthropocene, cultural
theory, broadly conceived, lost its explanatory power. This assessment
of inadequacy repeats across much of the recent new materialist
scholarship, condensing the cultural turn into a discursive reductionism
that rebuffs the empirical for the ideal, or the material for the
symbolic. Elizabeth Grosz's (2004) The Nick of Time opens with a telling
"reminder to social, political, and cultural theorists, particularly
those interested in feminism, antiracism, and questions of the politics
of globalization, that they have forgotten a crucial dimension of
research...not just the body, but that which makes it possible and which
limits its actions: the precarious, accidental, contingent, expedient,
striving, dynamic status of life in a messy, complicated, resistant,
brute world of materiality" (p. 2). Social, political, and cultural
theory, in other words, have overlooked the material conditions of life
that render the body available for inscription and enculturation in the
first instance. So too in the recently published Gut Feminism does
Elizabeth Wilson (2015) rebuke "social constructionism" for "\[tending\]
not to be very curious about the details of empirical claims in
genetics, neurophysiology, evolutionary biology, pharmacology or
biochemistry" (p. 3). [Her ensuing conclusion is that focusing on how
social structures produce and discipline bodies comes at the expense of
recognizing the ways bodies radically alter and organize social
structures themselves. It appears that cultural theory harbors an
"allergy to 'the real'" that dissuades "critical inquirers from the more
empirical kinds of investigation that material processes and structures
require"]{.underline} (Coole & Frost, 2010, p. 6). However,
[[the]{.mark} very [aspects that]{.mark} would [make matter more "real"
than language]{.mark} or culture are the same aspects that [restrict its
**ethical potential** and **facilitate a conceptual rejection of
race**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In line with their post-humanist agenda,
the new materialisms evoke matter and materiality as existing in excess
of human subjectivity and its attendant domains. Mechanistic theories of
causality hold that objects are composed of inert matter acted upon by
external forces, which presumes that an object's potential or possible
capabilities are already present and fixed in some initial moment of
creation. But, as the new materialisms emphasize, the virtual field of
differential relations is immanent to matter in such a way that it is
impossible to anticipate all of the effects a material configuration may
have, or the organizational forms it may take. This ability to act
independently of the subject's will and desire is variously construed as
"impersonal and preindividual forces," an alterity that "comes from
outside the capability or power of the subject" (Cheah, 2010, p. 80,
89), "degrees of indetermination" that represent the "'true principle of
life'" (Grosz, 2010, p. 149), and a "powerful reminder...that life will
always exceed our knowledge and control" (Bennett, 2010, p.14).
Differences in terminology aside, the new materialisms are united by an
understanding of materiality as a spectral, impersonal force with
material effects, one that escapes reason and disrupts systems of
meaning, including modernist binaries like mind/body, culture/nature,
and inside/outside (Dolphijn & van der Tuin, 2012). The latter aspect is
key because, while matter can frustrate representation, its "excessive"
properties do not mean that it exists "outside" of the subject. Rather,
matter and materiality are "real" because they actively produce reality
in unpredictable ways (Cheah, 2010). It is here that the ethical impetus
of the new materialist project is located. If we accept our embeddedness
in mutually transformative, nonhuman networks, the ground of ethics
shifts accordingly. First, a responsibility to an externalized other
gives way to an accountability for the many relations that constitute
becoming. And second, ethics are no longer reducible to the decisions or
actions of individuals that are initiated by a properly historical
judgment. In Rosi Braidotti's (2010) terms, "Accepting the impossibility
of mutual recognition and replacing it with one of mutual specification
and mutual codependence is what is at stake in postsecular affirmative
ethics" (p. 214). I find nothing immediately problematic with an ethics
that aspires to keep pace with advancements in science, philosophy, and
technology. What I find troublesome is how our acquiescence to these
ethics is solicited. New materialist ethics necessarily manifest as
affective encounters that operate best on micropolitical scales. Because
materiality is figured as an impersonal force of the real, it runs the
risk of becoming a transcendental signified that merely replaces
language or culture as an organizing principle. Doing so would severely
diminish its import as an inducement to a posthumanist ethics. [[To
circumvent the]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[tension between
**universal**]{.mark}**istic** [theory]{.mark}]{.underline} and
**[[specific]{.underline}]{.mark}** mode of
[[inquiry]{.underline}]{.mark}," chance,
**[[contingency]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[creativity]{.underline}]{.mark}** in micro-level encounters [[are
prioritized over]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[**obstinate** assemblages
that **congeal at**]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[global]{.underline}]{.mark}** or macro-[[levels]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Zhan, 2016, p. 26). Further, as the nucleus of the new materialisms,
the embodied subject or material body compels an ethics that unfolds on
a parallel plane, meaning between and within bodies. "This implies,"
Rosi Braidotti (2010) proposes, "approaching the world through
affectivity and not cognition: as singularity, force, movement, through
assemblages or webs of interconnections with all that lives," and
"accepting the impossibility of mutual recognition and replacing it with
one of mutual specification and mutual codependence" (p. 214). In the
quotation above, Braidotti invokes an ethics of relation, in which
sensation and perception comprise the "zone of \[ethical\] effectivity,"
and attunement and affirmation take precedence over social
transformation (Tumino, 2011, p. 555). Because material inter- and
intraactions are preconscious and multisensorial, ethical practice is
based not on the ability to evaluate right from wrong, but on a
commitment to feeling right. We can observe this adjustment in appeals
to "an ongoing responsiveness to...entanglement" (Barad, 2007, p. 394),
"a heightened sensitivity to the agency of assemblages" (Bennett,
2010b), a "wakefulness" to the "feel \[of\] what makes us laugh, lament,
and curse" (Orlie, 2007, p. 127) and an "experience of the vitality of
being" (Connolly, 2010, pp. 196-197). As a consequence, [the
[**experiences** of living under]{.mark} conditions of [crisis are
**fetishized** at the expense of **addressing** ]{.mark}**the
[causes]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} these [conditions]{.mark}
themselves]{.underline}. [The imperative to "\[live\] with the open
wound\...through a sort of **depersonalization** of the
event]{.underline}" (Braidotti, 2010, p. 213), for example, [not only
depoliticizes the claims of historically oppressed communities, but also
**flattens distinctions** between traumas inflicted through
**happenstance** and **persistent intergenerational harm**.]{.underline}
How else could one, as Braidotti does, list as equivalent examples:
those who survived the Holocaust, Frida Kahlo's deadly tram ride, and
missing the train to the World Trade Center on September 11th (p. 214)?
The limits of a new materialist ethics appear most forcefully, then, as
we attempt to move from an embodied "responsiveness" to the dislocation
of structures. When patterns of materialization are addressed, it is
generally as the amalgamation of "perpetual circuits of exchange,
feedback, and reentry" that thereby "\[inflect\] the shape of political
experience" (Connolly, 2010, pp. 190-191). On the one hand, there is
nothing innately objectionable about attributing the creation and
transformation of political structures to any number of quotidian,
embodied experiences. This is in fact common in political theory and
historiography.8 On the other hand, [[it becomes]{.underline}]{.mark}
more [[difficult to reconcile]{.underline}]{.mark} the effects of
chance, unpredictability, and **[[indeterminacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[with the **endurance** and **repetition** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
something like antiblack violence.9 [The new materialisms are therefore
at pains to clarify why the structures of global [antiblackness]{.mark}
continue to function [as if]{.mark} "[neither time nor]{.mark} history,
nor historiography and its [topics]{.mark}, [show movement]{.mark}, [as
the]{.mark} human [subject is 'murdered' over and over]{.mark} again by
the passions of a bloodless and anonymous archaism, showing itself in
endless disguise"]{.underline} (Spillers, 2003, p. 208). [Interpreting
and describing our entanglements with non-human, materialist forces are
not enough to account for, much less dislodge attachments to, social
categories and representational arrangements. By this I mean that
[becoming more aware of material forces will not]{.mark} inevitably
[reduce the weight of]{.mark} discursive or **[psychic
formations]{.mark}**. [It could]{.mark} even [**obstruct change** by
making]{.mark} forms of affect and [sensation]{.mark} newly **[available
for inscription]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Timothy Morton (2007) states,
when "contact becomes content," perceptions of difference collapse into
identity (p. 37). Granted, these complications are not unique to the new
materialisms as changes in scale almost always require a re-calibration
of ethics. The point is, however, that the framing of the new
materialisms as inherently more ethical generates, and is generated by,
a disavowal or misreading of race as a stagnant analytical framework. As
I submit above, since at least the Enlightenment period intellectual
genealogies have maintained an almost overwhelming racial homogeneity.
Critical theories produced by non-white scholars may have increased in
terms of production or representation, but these are consistently marked
as minority perspectives that have little to do with universal or
ontological questions.10 Hence, black bodies especially are rendered
objects for theoretical development, rather than subjects of universal
philosophy. Coole and Frost (2010) continue this trend, revealing that
even as "feminists and class theorists have often insisted upon" the
importance of material bodies and environments, the authors remain
"\[concerned\] that such material dimensions have recently been
marginalized by fashionable constructivist approaches and identity
politics" (p. 19). The latter, they continue, "had a good deal to say
about the body and its imbrication in relationships of power, but we are
not convinced that they pay sufficient attention to the material
efficacy of bodies or have the theoretical resources to do so" (ibid.).
Such a statement is heavy with longstanding racial charges of
intellectual primitivism and parochialism. The unfortunate request to be
"convinced" of identity politics' intellectual merit effectively seals
an historically white critical theory as the standard for authoritative
knowledge production.11 One must also wonder about the referents for
these insufficiently materialist identity politics, given that the New
Materialisms anthology fails to cite even one example that might be
taken as representative of a larger trend. Even if Coole and Frost
employ "identity politics" as a shorthand for idealist approaches to
subjectivity, their statement betrays both a misunderstanding of studies
of "identity," and a symptomatic desire to abandon race. To be clear,
Coole and Frost never openly reduce "identity politics" to racial
identity. But in many if not most of new materialisms' founding texts,
race receives only casual mention alongside the "other socalled axes of
social difference" like sex, gender, and class, and often to specify a
concept that has been "paralyzed by \[a\] 'binary' take on dualism"
(Dolphijn & van der Tuin, 2012, p. 88, 143), or to name potential
beneficiaries of one's theorization (Barad, 2007; Grosz, 2004). We could
perhaps attribute this treatment of race to an obdurate politics of
attention (Ahmed, 2008) that determines which issues receive
consideration.12 Nonetheless, to ascertain if and how the new
materialisms might furnish us with a timelier ethics, we must first ask
what purpose the omission of race serves. The Movement for Black Lives
has forcefully reminded us that black bodies have historically provided
the standards against which the human subject and non-human objects are
measured. This is to say that the "rupture in the quality of being"
inaugurated by modern racial slavery is not limited to black lives
(Brand, 2001, p. 29). Black critical theorists repeatedly insist on the
world-historical scale of this rupture, tracking how it conditions our
thinking about humans and matter, and the movements of this thought
itself. What this means for our current discussion is that "the question
of race's reality has and continues to bear directly on hierarchies of
knowledge pertaining to the nature of reality itself" (Jackson, 2015, p.
216), or on what Dionne Brand (2001) calls our "cognitive schema" (p.
29). As a conceptual orientation or method of "way-finding," the
prevailing cognitive schema articulates **[[a libidinal economy of
antiblackness]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the history of ideas, ensuring,
as Spillers (2003) [[maintains]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[dominant symbolic
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the ruling episteme [[that releases the
dynamics of]{.underline}]{.mark} naming and
[[valuation]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[remains grounded in]{.mark} the
[originating]{.mark} metaphors of [captivity]{.mark} and
mutilation]{.underline};" "**[[sticks and bricks might break our
bones]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[but words will]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[most certainly [kill us]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (pp. 208-209). By
inverting a childhood rejoinder about the supposedly limited reach of
the symbolic, Spillers lays out a provocative proposal: the metaphors of
slavery are immanent to the force of the material. Although "'race'
alone bears no inherent meaning, even though it reifies in personality,"
it "gains its power from what it signifies by point, in what it allows
to come to meaning" (Spillers, 2003, p. 380). Black lives matter, and
blackness enlivens matter. It is possible, then, that the elaboration of
thought, the conditions of its enunciation and reception, are always
part of a racial praxis, even when those "personalities" that absorb the
reification of race are most absent. This is a paradigmatic example of
the prevailing cognitive schema at work. Antiblackness conditions the
force of materiality by determining the logic of both its actualization
and its theoretical manifestations. These functions become clearer when
we turn our attention to Octavia Butler's Parable duology.

People who are interested in struggle need to understand the \"libidinal
economy.\" Coalition politicos like Al Sharpton like to tell us to put
the unique experiences of black folks in the backseat to the interests
of poor folks more generally. Such [politicians expect]{.underline} us
to submerge our interests as black people on the assumption that [if

evidence]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} a lot of [nonblack people hate black
people]{.mark}, [**even if**doing so costs them]{.mark} money. If
someone tells you that the problems black folks face are really just the
problems that poor people face, they are telling you to ignore
the **libidinal
economy**. [They]{.mark} are [tell]{.mark}ing [you]{.mark} that [the
political economy]{.mark} of capitalism [is **more important** than the
libidinal economy]{.mark}]{.underline}[ ]{.mark}of antiblack
racism. What is \"libidinal economy\"? In Red, White, and Black: Cinema
and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms (2010, Duke University Press),
black political theorist Frank Wilderson highlights the distinction
between political economy and libidinal economy (p. 9): Jared Sexton
describes libidinal economy as "the economy, or distribution and
arrangement, of desire and identification (their condensation and
displacement), and the complex relationship between sexuality and the
unconscious." Needless to say,libidinal economy functions
variously **[across scales]{.underline}** and **[is as "objective" as
political economy]{.underline}**. Importantly, it is linked not only to
forms of attraction, affection and alliance, but also to aggression,
destruction, and the violence of lethal consumption. He emphasizes
that it is "the whole structure of psychic and emotional
life," something more than, but inclusive of or traversed by, what
Gramsci and other marxists call a "structure of feeling"; it is "a
dispensation of energies, concerns, points of attention, anxieties,
pleasures, appetites, revulsions, and phobias capable of both great
mobility and tenacious fixation." What does all this mean? Let\'s
interpret this elaborate definition and get to how it thinks of
\"economy.\" When we think of economy, we usually think of something
having to do with money. Wilderson uses the term political economy to
refer to economy in the ways that we usually think of it: the ways
people exchange materials and decide on how things are valued. Economy
doesn\'t just mean the economy in the sense of the stock market or
banks, but also any means of determining whether something is worth
doing or possessing based on how much capital and labor power it yields.
In struggle, we see over and over that money talks and bullshit
walks. Economy has to do [with [what they value **moves people to
act**]{.mark}. Economies are therefore very important to **political
action**. ]{.underline}But can there be an economy that exchanges
something other than money or capital? Yes. To understand \"economy\" as
Wilderson and Sexton use it, we have to think of economy in a more
general way as things of all kinds that we can trade or save. You can
accumulate not only cash or material items, but also fears and desires.
Certain people accumulate more fear (the black athlete) and desire (the
blonde cheerleader) than others. The term libidinal economy refers to
the systems of exchange and valuation for fantasies, desires, fears,
aversions, and enjoyment. Economy is about exchange and accumulation.
Everyone feels fear and aggression, but where is it directed? The
libidinal is about both people\'s desires, fantasies, and pleasures AND
their phobias, fears, and violent consumptions. A libidinal economy has
to do with which groups a subject is attracted to, which groups it is
willing to form alliances with, and which people it is willing to
provide affection to. Where can we see this libidinal economy? How can
we illustrate this distinction? The libido is the collection of things
like phobias and desires that are unconscious and invisible but that
have a visible effect on the world, including the money economy. Some
examples: [[We see **libidinal economies**]{.mark} at work **[any time
there is a response by state that is out
of]{.mark} all [proportion]{.mark} to the material effects of any
practice they are regulating**. [The US]{.mark}A **[incarcerates three
million]{.mark}** people, **[despite]{.mark}** the fact [that doing so
has an adverse impact on]{.mark} US [financial
security]{.mark}. Hence [the libidinal]{.mark} economy of the [fear of
black]{.mark} and brown [people]{.mark} (who together comprise the
overwhelming majority of inmates) [**trumps** the political economy
of]{.mark} the [cost-benefit analysis]{.mark} of maintaining prisons.
Let\'s [take another example of the **powder - versus
crack-cocaine** distinction]{.mark}, in which the same drug is punished
differently at the federal level. Because [the
two]{.mark} drugs [are]{.mark} **chemically [identical]{.mark}**]{.underline},
there shouldn\'t be any distinction between how their use and sale is
punished. In 2010, the law made it so that these two drugs were punished
the same, although the Obama administration isn\'t in any hurry to make
the abolition of this distinction retroactive so that the mostly black
and brown people who are locked up because of it will get released. But
the legal abolition of this distinction is not essential for us to look
at. What is essential is why that distinction was made in the first
place. Wilderson\'s work suggests that, for civil society, black people
pose a threat that has nothing to do with the chemical content or the
social and cultural effects of crack. **[Simply [by being associated
with black people, crack is seen as 100 times more
threatening]{.mark} than is powder cocaine]{.underline}**. The financial
and social costs of locking all those black and brown people up and the
financial and social costs of allowing all those white people to go free
and continue to sell does not really matter to civil society. What the
powder- versus crack-cocaine distinction shows is the desire to contain
the threat that blackness symbolizes. This is the mark of libidinal
economy. Cops, soldiers, firemen are considered sexually desirable
because they become the heroes of civil society. [The Oscar Grant
shooting. Amadou [**Diallo** was a victim]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} a [extreme]{.mark} kind of [violence because
of]{.mark} the **[phobias]{.mark}** that converged on his body. What is
the exchange?Civil society has an anxiety about crime, and crime is
always attached to black in urban areas. [Police don\'t]{.mark} have
to [get a monetary award]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} they [get the gratitude
of civil society]{.mark}. How does this play out in ways that don\'t
have to do strictly with money? The desire for them may not show up in
the amount of money they make. Cops get rewarded [for their
aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline} When the cop slammed dude into the
glass at BART. Prison guards, thought of as having the toughest beat on
the planet. They get rewarded for being the last line of defense against
George Jackson. Oscar Grant was an accumulation of aggression and
phobias. Why are the black people in Prince George\'s County, Maryland,
segregated from white people in their **[same socioeconomic
bracket]{.underline}**with the same kinds of high-value real estate, and
the same kinds of political-economic values? Living around white people
has a value that cannot be explained in strictly monetary terms. AFDC
benefited mostly white single mothers, and enjoyed a long history of
support from 1936-the 1960s. It initially excluded black people. By the
1960s, when black people started getting it, attitudes changed toward
it, making it seem like it was undeserved and a drain on national
prosperity, and by 1984, when Ronald Reagan referred to \"[[welfare
queens]{.mark} in Cadillacs,\" it was clear that AFDC [was]{.mark} [\"a
black thing.\"]{.mark} [In]{.mark}actual [statistical terms, it
was]{.mark} still [used most]{.mark}ly [by white
women]{.mark}.]{.underline} But once it became associated with poor
black women, it was seen as in need of drastic, radical reforms. But is
this \"libidinal economy\" really that important? Frank Wilderson is
using the distinction between a money economy and an economy of desire
over and over again throughout this book. Wilderson talks about this by
talking about the difference between word and deed. This is not the
hypocrisy of the system. It IS the logic of the system. So Europeans
tried to resolve the lack of labor power by passing laws that reduced
homeless white people to the status of slaves. In the end, however, they
never really enforced these laws. Wilderson quotes David Eltis, an
economic historian, who says that the costs of settling the \"new
world\" would have been significantly reduced if Europeans has simply
enslaved other Europeans. But, Wilderson points out, \"what Whites would
have gained in economic value, they would have lost in symbolic value;
and it is the \[symbolic value\] which structures the libidinal economy
of civil society.\" In other words, the symbolic costs of Europeans
enslaving other Europeans would have been too great. Instead, they went
to Africa for their slaves, even though the financial cost of doing so
was much, much greater. The radical left doesn\'t make this distinction.
Cornel West and Tavis Smiley say they want to organize a new Poor
People\'s Campaign, but they won\'t be able to explain why this is a
failed project from the start. This is because they won\'t think about
the aspects of coalition building that have nothing to do with money or
the lack of money. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the so-called
\"Reagan Democrats\" were poor and working-class white people, many of
them in unions, who voted overwhelmingly for Reagan against their own
economic interest. [[The]{.mark} white [left **mistakenly** thinks
about]{.mark} the Reagan[Democrats as **people who were
duped**]{.mark}**.** They view them as an example of what Marx called
\"false consciousness\" [and]{.mark} they [see it as their duty]{.mark}
[to **inform**]{.mark} the white poor and working class of [why they
should vote left]{.mark}. ]{.underline}But there were all kinds of signs
that white poor and working-class folks simply hated black people and
didn\'t want to live anywhere that there was a large community of black
people, even if those black people are of the same or higher
socioeconomic status. The Reagan Democrats were excited by Reagan\'s
antiblack rhetoric of law and order, a rhetoric that was in response
against the activities of the Black Liberation Army, Weather
Underground, Black Panthers, and Black Guerilla Family. Marxists think a
person is in a state of false consciousness if her political or social
interests go another way than her material or financial interests. If
you adopt this view, then you probably think that the Reagan Democrats
just need to be educated correctly about what they have in common with
the black poor and working class. You have to think that their hatred of
black people is somehow \"false\" simply because it runs counter to
their financial interests. But this would be to ignore their interest in
maintaining white supremacy and antiblack racism. One of the thingswhite
men would lose would be access to black bodies for sexual pleasure and
amusement. [[These examples
are **not**]{.mark}**just [isolated]{.mark}** [cases of]{.mark} false
consciousness, [ignorance]{.mark}, media manipulation, or some mystical
thing called \"prejudice.\"]{.underline} They are all of those things,
but they are also something much, much greater that any student of
struggle needs to be aware of. These examples reveal the contours of an
economy of desires that is not primarily concerned with money. It\'s not
that the political economy isn\'t also antiblack. In fact, both
economies are antiblack.

#### Blackness is libidinally constructed as the antithesis of modernity; questions of the political are irrelevant in this debate

**Wilderson 10**\[Frank Wilderson is Associate Professor at UC Irvine's
Department of Drama and African American Studies, Red, White & Black:
Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms (chapter 1) //\]

**[The libidinal economy of modernity and its attendant cartography (the
Western Hemisphere, the U.S., or civil society as a construct) achieves
its structure of unconscious exchange by way of a
"thanatology]{.underline}**" (Judy 89**[) in which Blackness
overdetermines the embodiment of impossibility, incoherence,
incapacity]{.underline}**. Furthermore**[[, political economy achieves
its symbolic]{.underline}]{.mark}** (political/economic) **[[capacity
and structure of preconscious exchange by way of]{.mark}]{.underline}**
a similar "**[[thanatology]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Judy goes so far as
to say that at **[[the crux of modernity's crisis is the dilemma "how to
represent the Negro as being demonstrably human within the terms of the
law]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (84). Here, of course, [he does not mean
"law" in a juridical sense but rather "law" as a portal of
intelligibility through which one can be said to have the capacity to
access "Reason" and thus be recognized and incorporated as a bona fide
subject]{.underline}. Through [[Judy's analysis of the Negro (the slave)
as modernity's necessity (the Other]{.underline}]{.mark} that humanity
is not: "simple enough one has only not to be a nigger"), that which
kick-starts and sustains the production of the Western Hemisphere, we
can begin to make the transition from the parasitic necessity of
Whiteness in libidinal economy to its parasitic necessity in political
economy. **[[Whiteness is parasitic because it monumentalizes its
subjective capacity, its lush cartography, in direct proportion to the
wasteland of Black incapacity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [By "capacity" I
have meant something more comprehensive than "the event" and its causal
elements and something more indeterminate than "agency."]{.underline} We
should think of it as a kind of facility or matrix through which
possibility itself---whether tragic or triumphant---can be elaborated:
the ebb and flow between, on the one hand, "empty speech," racist
actions, repressive laws, and institutional coherence and, on the other
hand, "full speech," armed insurrection, and the institutional ennui.
This is what I mean by capacity. It is a far cry from Spillers' state of
"being for the captor" (2003: 206) and Judy's "muted African body"
((Dis) Forming 89); a far cry from pure abject- or object-ness: without
thought, without agency, "with no capacity to move" (89). In short,
**[[White (Human) capacity, in advance of the event of discrimination or
oppression, is parasitic on Black incapacity]{.mark} (Judy 89): [without
the Negro, capacity itself is incoherent]{.mark}, uncertain at
best.]{.underline}**

### 1NC -- Burn it Down Alt

#### The alternative is to reject the affirmative as an act of burning down the civil society that produces violence against the slave. Freedom is an illusion created by the shackles of civil society and abandoning the pursuit for equality is the only way to break down the way that whiteness maintains itself.

**Farley 04** {Anthony Paul; Associate prof at Boston college Law
school; "perfecting slavery"; pg 235-238; January 27 2005}AvP

[What is to be done? Two hundred years ago, [when the slaves in Haiti
rose up, they]{.mark}, of necessity, [burned
everything]{.mark}]{.underline}: They burned San Domingo flat so that at
the end of the war it was a charred desert. Why do you burn everything?
asked a French officer of a prisoner. We have a right to burn what we
cultivate because a man has a right to dispose of his own labour, was
the reply of this unknown anarchist.48 [[The slaves burned everything
because everything was against them]{.mark}. Everything was against the
slaves, the entire order that it was their lot to follow, the entire
order in which they were positioned as worse than senseless things,
every plantation, everything.]{.underline}49 **[["Leave nothing white
behind you,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** said Toussaint to those dedicated to
the end of white-overblack. 50 "God gave Noah the rainbow sign. No more
water, the fire next time."51 The slaves burned everything, yes, but,
unfortunately, they only burned everything in Haiti.52 [[Theirs was the
greatest and most successful revolution in the history of the
world]{.mark} but the failure of their fire to cross the waters was the
great tragedy of the Nineteenth century**.**]{.underline}53 At the dawn
of the Twentieth century, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote, "The colorline belts the
world."54 Du Bois said that the problem of the Twentieth century was the
problem of the colorline.55 The problem, now, at the dawn of the
Twenty-first century is the problem of the colorline. The colorline
continues to belt the world. Indeed, [the slave power that is
[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates now [threatens a]{.mark}n
entire [world with the death that it has become and so the
slaves]{.mark} of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, those with nothing but
their chains to lose, [must]{.mark}, if they would be free, if they
would escape slavery, [win the entire world]{.mark}.]{.underline} win
the entire world. VIII. TRAINING We begin as children. We are called and
we become our response to the call. Slaves are not called. What becomes
of them? What becomes of the broken-hearted? The slaves are divided
souls, they are brokenhearted, the slaves are split asunder by what they
are called upon to become. The slaves are called upon to become objects
but objecthood is not a calling. The slave, then, during its loneliest
loneliness, is divided from itself. This is schizophrenia. The slaves
are not called, or, rather, the slaves are called to not be. [The slaves
are called unfree and thus the living can never be and so the slaves
burst apart and die. The [slaves begin as death]{.mark}, not as
children, and [death is]{.mark} not a beginning but [an end. There is no
progress and no exit from the]{.mark} undiscovered country of the
[slave]{.mark}, or so it seems. [We are trained to think through a
progress narrative]{.mark}, a grand narrative, the grandest narrative[,
that takes us up from slavery. There is no up from
slavery.]{.mark}]{.underline} The progress from white-over-black to
white-over-black to white-overblack. The progress of slavery runs in the
opposite direction of the past-present- future timeline. [[The slave
only becomes the perfect slave at the end of the timeline]{.mark}, only
[under conditions of total juridical freedom.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is
only under conditions of freedom, of bourgeois legality, that the slave
can perfect itself as a slave by freely choosing to bow down before its
master. The slave perfects itself as a slave by offering a prayer for
equal rights. [[The system of marks is a plantation]{.mark}. The system
of property is a plantation. The system of law is a plantation. These
plantations, all part of the same system, hierarchy, produce
white-overblack, white-over-black only, and that
continually.]{.underline} The slave perfects itself as a slave through
its prayers for equal rights. [The plantation system will not commit
suicide and the slave, as stated above, has knowing non-knowledge of
this fact. **[The slave finds its way back from the undiscovered country
only by burning down every plantation.]{.mark}**]{.underline} When the
slave prays for equal rights it makes the free choice to be dead, and it
makes the free choice to not be.

## Framing

Card tgat says nuclear doesn't o/w

### Framing -- Antiblackness First

#### Black slavery is foundational to modern Humanism's ontics because "freedom" is the hub of Humanism's infinite conceptual trajectories.

**Wilderson III 10'** (Wilderson, Frank B. *Red, White & Black: Cinema
and the Structure of U.s. Antagonisms*. Durham, NC: Duke University
Press, 2010. Print.)

But [[these trajectories only appear to be infinite. They are finite in
the sense that they are predicated on the idea of freedom from some
contingency that can be named, or at least conceptualized. The
contingent rider could be freedom from patriarchy, freedom from economic
exploitation, free- dom from political tyranny]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g., taxation without representation[), [free- dom from
heteronormativity, and so on.]{.mark}]{.underline} What I am suggesting
is that [[first political discourse recognizes freedom as a structuring
ontologic and then it works to disavow this recognition by imagining
freedom not through political ontology]{.underline}]{.mark}---where it
rightfully began---but through political experience (and practice);
[whereupon it immediately loses its ontological
foundations]{.underline}. Why would anyone do this? Why would anyone
start off with, quite literally, an earth-shattering ontologic and, in
the process of meditating on it and acting through it, reduce it to an
earth-reforming experience? Why do Humans take such pride in
self-adjustment, in diminishing, rather than intensifying, the project
of liberation (how did we get from 1968 to the present)? Because, I
contend, in allowing the notion of freedom to attain the ethical purity
of its ontological status, one would have to lose one's Human
coordinates and become Black. Which is to say one would have to die.

#### The singularity of antiblackness is the stage upon which all other dramas of violence occur.

**Sharpe 16** \[Christina, Christina Sharpe is a scholar of English
literature and Black Studies. Her academic research focuses Black visual
studies, Black queer studies, and mid-nineteenth century to contemporary
African-American Literature and Culture, "In the Wake: On Blackness and
Being", Published: 2016, DOA: 6/23/19, Reagan RB for michklab\]

In the United States, [slavery is imagined as a singular event even as
it changed over time and even as its duration expands into supposed
emancipation and beyond. But [slavery was not singular]{.mark}; it was,
rather, a singularity---[a weather event or phenomenon likely to occur
around a particular time]{.mark}, or date, or set of
circumstances]{.underline}. Emancipation did not make free Black life
free; it continues to hold us in that singularity. [[The brutality was
not singular; it was the singularity of antiblackness]{.mark}.
Singularity: a point or region of infinite mass density at which space
and time are infinitely distorted by gravitational forces and which is
held to be the final state of matter falling into a black
hole.]{.underline} (Merriam-Webster Online) In what I am calling the
weather, antiblackness is pervasive as climate. The weather necessitates
changeability and improvisation; it is the atmospheric condition of time
and place; it produces new ecologies. Ecology: the branch of biology
that deals with the relations of organisms to one another and to their
physical surroundings; the political movement that seeks to protect the
environment, especially from pollution. We read in Beloved one ecology
of the ship that continues into the present: "[In the beginning the
women are away from the men and the men are away from the women storms
rock us and mix the men into the women and the women into the men"
(Morrison 1987, 211). [The weather trans\*forms Black
being]{.mark}.]{.underline} But the shipped, the held, and those in the
wake also produce out of the weather their own ecologies. When the only
certainty is the weather that produces a pervasive climate of
anti-blackness, what must we know in order to move through these
environments in which the push is always toward Black death? An example
of knowledge to survive such lived and produced ecologies comes to us
via Dionne Brand's "Ruttier for the Marooned in the Diaspora." "The oral
ruttier," she writes, "is a long poem containing navigational
instructions which sailors learned by heart and recited from memory."
The "Ruttier" (historical and present) "contained the routes and tides,
the stars and maybe the taste and flavour of the waters, the coolness,
the saltiness; all for finding one's way at sea" (Brand 2001, 212).
Coming at the end of A Map to the Door of No Return, Brand's "Ruttier"
has taken note of the weather, and this poem appears as a way-making
tool, a gift of knowledge that, and how, [[Black life is lived in the
wake]{.mark}. The inhabitants of Diaspora are marooned, tenantless,
deserted. Desolation castaway, [abandoned in the world]{.mark}. They
was, is, wandered, wanders as spirits who dead cut, banished, seclude,
refuse, shut the door, derelict, relinquished, apart. More words she has
left them. Cast behind. . . . [All unavailable to themselves, open to
the world, cut in air]{.mark}. . . . And it doesn't matter where in the
world, this spirit is no citizen, no national, no one who is christened,
no sex, this spirit is washed of all its lading, bag and baggage, jhaji
bundle, georgie bindle, lock stock, knapsack, and barrel, and only holds
its own weight which is nothing, which is memoryless and tough with
remembrances, heavy with lightness, aching with grins.]{.underline}
(Brand 2001, 213) A long poem for those of us in the wake of those
ships, Brand's "Ruttier" does not contain conventional navigational
instructions to country and safe landing (could it? those of us in the
wake cannot use such conventional means); [it does contain what
present/future migrants might meet, refuse, and remake on and in their
journeys. The "Ruttier" takes as ground that first plunge into
unbelonging, reframes as gift that absence of country]{.underline}. I
read the "Ruttier," then, as a way-making tool and a refusal of nation,
country, citizenship; it is a barometer, a reading of and a response to
those atmospheric pressures and the predictably unpredictable changes in
climates that, nonetheless, remain antiblack. The boats set out in all
kinds of weather from Zliten and Tripoli and other points along the
coast of Libya. [[These boats have no names]{.mark}, though they might
come to be called Left-to-Die. Those Africans from other countries who
had been living and working in Libya set out, now, because of the war,
the ongoing destruction of Libya, and all that has occurred since. The
atmosphere radically changed, specifically in relation to "Black
Africans," and so they boarded those "wrecked and wretched boats." "The
Libyans who got me to Italy are not human," he said. "[They speak with
the gun not with]{.mark} [words]{.mark}. . . . [They pushed eight
Nigerians into the sea]{.mark}." . . . And they pushed my friend into
the sea. [They all drowned]{.mark}. 4 [Teenagers arriving in the
Italian]{.mark} [port of Lampedusa]{.mark} told workers from Save the
Children how migrants from sub-Saharan African countries [were often
kept below the deck]{.mark}, [deprived of water and sunlight]{.mark}. .
. . The weather was really bad. Some people were afraid. They didn't
want to go, but there was no way back. (Dearden 2015) The boats set out
one after another. [And when the migrants reach the shore they are often
returned to the hold in the form of the camp, the Lager, the detention
center]{.mark}, and so on, and they may be returned to the ship. Cast
behind, set adrift, once again.]{.underline}

### Framing -- Epistemology

#### Framework is violent -- it necessitates the creation and adherence to antiblack thought, research, and scholarship 

**Sharpe 16** \[Christina, Christina Sharpe is a scholar of English
literature and Black Studies. Her academic research focuses Black visual
studies, Black queer studies, and mid-nineteenth century to contemporary
African-American Literature and Culture, "In the Wake: On Blackness and
Being", Published: 2016, DOA: 6/23/19, Reagan RB for michklab\]

Those of us who teach, write, and think about slavery and its afterlives
encounter myriad silences and ruptures in time, space, history, ethics,
research, and method as we do our work. Again and again [scholars of
slavery face absences in the archives as we attempt to find "the agents
buried beneath" (Spillers 2003b) the accumulated erasures, projections,
fabulations, and misnamings]{.underline}. There are, [I think, [specific
ways that Black scholars of slavery get wedged in the partial
truths]{.mark} of the archives [while trying to make sense of their
silences]{.mark}, absences, and modes of dis/appearance. [The methods
most readily available to us sometimes]{.mark}, oftentimes, [force us
into positions that run counter to what we know]{.mark}.]{.underline}
That is, [[our knowledge]{.mark}, of slavery and Black being in slavery,
[is gained from our studies]{.mark}, yes, but also in excess of those
studies; 18 [it is gained through the kinds of knowledge from and of the
everyday]{.mark}, from what Dionne Brand calls "sitting in the room with
history." 19 We are expected to discard, discount, disregard, jettison,
abandon, and measure those ways of knowing and to enact epistemic
violence that we know to be violence against others and
ourselves.]{.underline} In other words, [**[for Black academics to
produce legible work in the academy often means adhering to research
methods that are "drafted into the service of a larger destructive
force"]{.mark} (Saunders 2008a, 67), thereby [doing violence to our own
capacities to]{.mark} [read, think, and imagine]{.mark}
otherwise**.]{.underline} Despite knowing otherwise, [we are often
disciplined into thinking through and along lines that reinscribe our
own annihilation, reinforcing and reproducing what Sylvia Wynter (1994,
70) has called our "narratively condemned status.]{.underline}" We must
become undisciplined. [The work we do requires new modes and methods of
research and teaching; new ways of entering and leaving the archives of
slavery, of undoing the "racial calculus and . . . political arithmetic
that were entrenched centuries ago" (Hartman 2008, 6) and that live into
the present]{.underline}. I think this is what Brand describes in A Map
to the Door of No Return as a kind of blackened knowledge, an
unscientific method, that comes from observing that where one stands is
relative to the door of no return and that moment of historical and
ongoing rupture. With this as the ground, I've been trying to articulate
a method of encountering a past that is not past. A method along the
lines of a sitting with, a gathering, and a tracking of phenomena that
disproportionately and devastatingly affect Black peoples any and
everywhere we are. I've been thinking of this gathering, this collecting
and reading toward a new analytic, [as the wake and wake work, and I am
interested in plotting, mapping, and collecting the archives of the
everyday of Black immanent and imminent death, and in tracking the ways
we resist, rupture, and disrupt that immanence and imminence
aesthetically and materially.]{.underline}

### Framing -- Prior Question

#### Prioritize our impacts over their offense---racism has to come first

**Memmi 2000** - MEMMI Professor Emeritus of Sociology @ Unv. Of Paris
Albert-; RACISM, translated by Steve Martinot, pp.163-165

[[The struggle against racism]{.underline}]{.mark} will be long,
difficult, without intermission, without remission, probably never
achieved, yet for this very reason, it [[is a struggle to be undertaken
without surcease and without concessions]{.underline}]{.mark}. One
cannot be indulgent toward racism. [[One cannot]{.mark}]{.underline}
even [[let the monster in the house]{.mark}, especially not in a mask[.
To give it merely a foothold means to augment the bestial part in
us]{.mark}]{.underline} and in other people which is to diminish what is
human. [[To accept the racist universe to the slightest degree is to
endorse fear, injustice, and violence]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is to
accept the persistence of the dark history in which we still largely
live. It is to agree that the outsider will always be a possible victim
(and which \[person\] man is not \[themself\] himself an outsider
relative to someone else?). Racism illustrates in sum, the inevitable
negativity of the condition of the dominated; that is it illuminates in
a certain sense the entire human condition. The anti-racist struggle,
difficult though it is, and always in question, is nevertheless one of
the prologues to the ultimate passage from animality to humanity. In
that sense, we cannot fail to rise to the racist challenge. However, it
remains true that one's moral conduct only emerges from a choice: one
has to want it. It is a choice among other choices, and always debatable
in its foundations and its consequences. Let us say, broadly speaking,
that the choice to conduct oneself morally is the condition for the
establishment of a human order for which racism is the very negation.
This is almost a redundancy. [[One cannot found a moral order, let alone
a legislative order, on racism because racism signifies the exclusion of
the other and his or her subjection to violence and domination.]{.mark}
From an ethical point of view,]{.underline} if one can deploy a little
religious language, [racism is "the truly capital sin.]{.underline}"fn22
It is not an accident that almost all of humanity's spiritual traditions
counsel respect for the weak, for orphans, widows, or strangers. It is
not just a question of theoretical counsel respect for the weak, for
orphans, widows or strangers. It is not just a question of theoretical
morality and disinterested commandments. Such unanimity in the
safeguarding of the other suggests the real utility of such sentiments.
All things considered, we have an interest in banishing injustice,
because [injustice engenders violence and death]{.underline}. Of course,
this is debatable. There are those who think that if one is strong
enough, the assault on and oppression of others is permissible. But no
one is ever sure of remaining the strongest. One day, perhaps, the roles
will be reversed. [[All unjust society contains within itself the seeds
of its own death]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is probably smarter to treat
others with respect so that they treat you with respect. "Recall," says
the bible, "that you were once a stranger in Egypt," which means both
that you ought to respect the stranger because you were a stranger
yourself and that you risk becoming once again someday. It is an ethical
and a practical appeal -- indeed, it is a contract, however implicit it
might be. In short, [the refusal of racism is the condition for all
theoretical and practical morality.]{.underline} Because, in the end,
[[the ethical choice commands the political choice]{.mark}. A just
society must be a society accepted by all. [If this contractual
principle is not accepted, then only conflict, violence, and destruction
will be our lot.]{.mark}]{.underline} If it is accepted, we can hope
someday to live in peace. True, it is a wager, but [[the stakes are
irresistible.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### AT Education

#### We'll link turn it -- the only real world education comes from analyzing how we arrive at certain policies and how the USFG has become institutionally racist -- education comes when we can use our skills inside debate to figure out how to break down systems of oppression

**Farley'5**

{Anthony Paul; Associate prof at Boston college Law school; "perfecting
slavery";pg 250-251; January 27 2005}

[Slavery is death. [For the master, education in the slave is a
horror]{.mark}]{.underline}.105 [For the master, the educated slave is
[uncanny]{.mark}.]{.underline}106 [[Education brings the slave]{.mark},
who is death, [back from death]{.mark}, back from the undiscovered
country, [back to life.]{.mark} This is uncanny for the master because
the [master has knowing non-knowledge that to return from death, the
slave must end slavery.]{.mark}]{.underline}107 The master experiences
this knowing non-knowledge as uncanny. [[We fear death and the slave is
the body of the death that we fear]{.mark}: The fear of the dead, who
return to take away with them the living, has found an explanation from
the point of view of individual and social psychology in the unconscious
death wishes which the survivor harbored against the dead person while
he lived, because of which he now fears that person's
vengeance]{.underline}.108 The master should be afraid. [[The
slaves]{.mark} that return from the undiscovered country do indeed plan
to "[take away with them the living"]{.mark}109 and so the fear of
death, and of the return of the dead, has a foundation.
White-over-black---death---is the foundation. [Education undermines the
foundation of white-over-black and so education of the slave is the
foundation of the fear of the dead.]{.mark} Education is the way that
the slave begins its return from the undiscovered country. Revolution is
the way that the returned slaves complete their return and, through that
completion, manage to "take away with them the living]{.underline}."110
What will be cast into the fire next time? Heed the words of C.L.R.
James's unknown anarchist, "\[w\]e have a right to burn what we
cultivate," and an answer appears. The slaves are the ones who cultivate
the philosophy of right.111 It is the slaves calling to create the rule
of law. And that is what they will burn to free themselves from the
Promised Land. It only takes a single spark.

### AT Fairness

#### Procedural fairness and their model of debate uphold debate as a white fantasy space that reproduces anti-blackness.

**Wilderson 8** (Frank B. Wilderson (associate professor of African
American Studies and Drama at UC Irvine, PhD in Rhetoric and Film
Studies from UC Berkeley), "Incognegro: A Memoir of Exile and
Apartheid", South End Press, pp. 406-411)//Xain

Just two years ago, in December of 1999, I\'d written a letter and
stuffed it, late one night, in the faculty mailboxes. It began with what
must have appeared to the faculty\'s confused eyes as a red herring. It
spoke not about my excruciating encounters with them, but began,
instead, out of left field by discussing the plight of two students
whose troubles with the College had been the topic of recent debate.
Reading of Sonia Rodriguez\'s and Selma Thornton\'s troubles with the
Student Senate and its White liberal adviser Tim Harold reawakened my
disdain for Cabrillo as an institution and for the English Division as
one of its flagship entities. I then went on to explain how Selma and
Sonia had resigned their posts in the Student Senate in protest over
Harold\'s decision not to allow thirty students of color to have funds
to travel to a conference on race at Hartnell College. Instead, Harold
spent the money on T-shirts. He had also put the sign-up sheet for the
conference not in the Student Center, but in some obscure location where
it would never be found thus sabotaging the excursion further. This
seemed like a trivial enough matter, but it compounded the hurt and
sense of isolation and rebuke which so many Black and Latino students
felt at Cabrillo but could not name. I felt a piqued kinship with their
unspeakable pain and used the rare moment of it having turned into a
tangible event as a way into what I wanted to say to the faculty and
administration\...and to Alice. In defense of his actions, and as a way
of indicating the absurdity of Selma and Sonia\'s objections, Harold
issued a public statement in which he did not comment (or at least the
newspaper did not report his comments) on his funding priorities;
rather, he simply said \"The sign-up sheet was posted for a week, the
same way we treat any workshop.\" To this, I wrote: Whereas Selma
Thornton attempts an institutional analysis of the Student Senate by way
of a critique of Tim Harold and his practices, Harold responds with **a
ready made institutional defense** and, later in the article, a defense
of his integrity (a personalized response to an institutional analysis).
[**[He brings the scale of abstraction back down to the level most
comfortable for White people:]{.mark} the individual and** [the
uncontextualized realm of fair play. It\'s the White person\'s safety
zone.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[I\'m a good person, I\'m a fair person, I
treat everyone equally, the rules apply to everyone.]{.underline}**
Thornton and Rodriguez\'s comments don\'t indict Harold for being a
\"good\" person**[, they indict him for being White: a way of being in
the world which legitimates institutional practices]{.underline}**
(practices which Thornton and Rodriguez object to) accepts, and
promotes, them as timeless---without origin, consequence, interest, or
allegiance---natural and inevitable. \"The sign-up sheet was posted for
a week, the same way we treat any workshop.\" **[[The whole idea that we
treat everyone equally is only slightly more odious]{.mark} than the
discussion or how we can treat everyone equally; [because the problem
is]{.mark} neither the practice nor the debates surrounding it, but the
fact [that White people can come together and wield enough institutional
power to constitute a \"We]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}** \"We\" in the
Student Senate, \"We\" in Aptos, \"We\" in Santa Cruz, \"We\" in the
English department, \"We\" in the boardrooms. \"We\" are fair and
balanced is as odious as **[\"We\" are in control---they are derivations
of the same expression: [\"We\" are the police.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[The claim of \"balance and fair play\"]{.mark} forecloses upon, not
only the modest argument that the practices of the Cabrillo Student
Senate [are racist and illegitimate]{.mark},]{.underline}** but it also
forecloses upon the more extended, comprehensive, and antagonistic
argument that Cabrillo itself is racist and illegitimate. And what do we
mean by Cabrillo[? **[The White people who constitute its fantasies of
pleasure and its discourse of
legitimacy]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** The generous
\"We.\" So, let\'s bust \"We\" wide open and start at the end: White
people are guilty until proven innocent. Fuck the compositional moves of
substantiation and supporting evidence: I was at a conference in West
Oakland last week where a thousand Black folks substantiated it a
thousand different ways. You\'re free to go to West Oakland, find them,
talk to them, get all the proof you need. You can drive three hours to
the mountains, so you sure as hell can cut the time in half and drive to
the inner city. Knock on any door. Anyone who knows 20 to 30 Black
folks, intimately---and if you don\'t know 12 then you\'re not living in
America, you\'re living in White America---knows the statement to be
true. **[[White people are guilty until proven innocent]{.mark}. Whites
[are guilty of]{.mark} being friends with each other, of standing up for
their rights, of pledging allegiance to the flag, of [reproducing
concepts like fairness]{.mark}, meritocracy, balance, standards, [norms,
harmony]{.mark} between the races.]{.underline}** Most of all. **[Whites
are guilty of wanting stability and reform.]{.underline}** White people,
like Mr. Harold and those in the English Division, are guilty of asking
themselves the question. **[How can we maintain the maximum amount of
order (liberals at Cabrillo use euphemisms like peace, harmony,
stability), with the minimum amount of change, while presenting
ourselves---if but only to ourselves---as having the best of all
possible intentions]{.underline}**. Good people. Good intentions. White
people are the only species, human or otherwise, capable of transforming
the dross of good intentions into the gold of grand intentions, and
naming it \"change.\" \...**[[These passive revolutions]{.mark}, fire
and brimstone conflicts [over which institutional reform is
better]{.mark} than the other one, [provide a smoke screen]{.mark}---a
diversionary play of interlocutions---[that keep real]{.mark} and
necessary [antagonisms at bay]{.mark}.]{.underline}** White people are
thus able to go home each night, perhaps a little wounded, but feeling
better for having made Cabrillo a better place\...for everyone\...
Before such hubris at high places makes us all a little too giddy, let
me offer a cautionary note: it\'s scientifically impossible to
manufacture shinola out of shit. But White liberals keep on trying and
end up spending a lifetime not knowing shit from shinola. Because
**[[White people love]{.mark} their jobs, they love their institutions,
they love [their country]{.mark}, most of all they love each other. [And
every Black]{.mark} or Brown body [that doesn\'t love the things you
love is a threat]{.mark} to your love for each other. A threat to your
fantasy space, your terrain of shared pleasures.]{.underline}**
**[Passive revolutions have a way of incorporating Black and Brown
bodies to either term of the debate.]{.underline}** What choice does one
have? The third (possible, but always unspoken) term of the debate,
[[White people are guilty of structuring debates which reproduce the
institution and the institution reproduces America]{.underline}]{.mark}
and America is always and everywhere a bad thing this term is never on
the table, because the level of abstraction is too high for White
liberals. They\'ve got too much at stake: their friends, their family,
their way of life. Let\'s keep it all at eye level, where whites can
keep an eye on everything. So the Black body is incorporated. Because to
be unincorporated is to say that what White liberals find valuable I
have no use for. This, of course, is anti-institutional and shows a lack
of breeding, not to mention a lack of gratitude for all the noblesse
oblige which has been extended to the person of color to begin with**[.
\"[We will incorporate colored folks into our fold,]{.mark} whenever
possible and at our own pace, [provided they\'re team players]{.mark},
speak highly of us, pretend to care what we\'re thinking, are highly
qualified, blah, blah, blah\...but, and this is key, we won\'t entertain
the rancor which shits on our fantasy space.]{.underline}**

### Link -- Climate Change

**Global warming is not evenly distributed nor equally created - warming
only a miniscule symptom of a larger archetype of whiteness
irreconcilable with their contingent, state-sanctioned solutions. They
normalize a metanarrative of pragmatism which obfuscates the
[machinations of privilege.]{.underline}**

**Wynter 7** (Sylvia, Professor Emeritus in Spanish and Romance
Languages at Stanford University, \"The Human being as noun? Or being
human as praxis? Towards the Autopoietic turn/overturn: A Manifesto,\"
otl2.wikispaces.com/file/view/The+Autopoetic+Turn.pdf -- hhs ew)

For if, as Time magazine reported in January 2007 (Epigraph 2), a U.N.
Intergovernmental panel of Natural Scientists, were soon to release \"a
smoking-gun report which confirms that human activities are to blame for
global warming\" (and thereby for climate change), and had therefore
predicted \"catastrophic disruptions by 2100,\" by April, the issued
Report not only confirmed the above, but also repeated the major
contradiction which the Time account had re-echoed. This contradiction,
however, has nothing to do in any way with the rigor, and precision of
their natural scientific findings, but rather with the contradiction
referred to by Derrida\'s question in Epigraph 3---i.e., But who, we?
That is, **[[their attribution of]{.mark} the non-natural [factors
driving global warming]{.mark} and climate change [to,]{.mark} [generic
human activities]{.mark}, and/or to \"[anthropocentric
forcings]{.mark}\"; [with what is]{.mark}, in effect, [this
mis-attribution]{.mark}]{.underline}** then determining the nature of
their policy recommendations to deal with the already ongoing reality of
global warming and climate change, to be ones couched largely in
economic terms. That is, in the terms of our present mode of knowledge
production, and its \"perceptual categorization system\" as elaborated
by the disciplines of the Humanities and Social Sciences (or \"human
sciences\") and which are reciprocally enacting of our present
sociogenic genre of being human, as that of the West\'s Man in its
second Liberal or bio-humanist reinvented form, as homo oeconomicus; as
optimally \"virtuous Breadwinner, taxpayer, consumer, and as
systemically over-represented as if it, and its behavioral activities
were isomorphic with the being of being human, and thereby with
activities that would be definable as the human-as-a-species ones.
Consequently, the Report\'s authors because logically taking such an
over-representation as an empirical fact, given that, as highly trained
natural scientists whose domains of inquiry are the physical and
(purely) biological levels of reality, although their own
natural-scientific order of cognition with respect to their appropriate
non-human domains of inquiry, is an imperatively self-correcting and
therefore, necessarily, a cognitively open/open-ended one, nevertheless,
because **[[in order to be natural scientists, they are]{.mark}
therefore [necessarily]{.mark}, at the same time, [middle class Western
or westernized subjects]{.mark}, initiated]{.underline}** 15 as such,
**[by means of our present overall education system and its mode of
knowledge production to be the optimal symbolically encoded embodiment
of the West\'s Man]{.underline}**, it its second reinvented bio-humanist
homo oeconomicus, and therefore **[bourgeois
self-conception]{.underline}**, over-represented as if it were
isomorphic with the being of being human, **[[they]{.mark} also [fall
into the trap]{.mark} identified by Derrida in the case of his fellow
French philosophers. The trap, that is, [of conflating their own
existentially experienced (Western-bourgeois]{.mark} or ethno-class)
[referent \"we,\" with the \"we\" of \"the horizon of
humanit]{.mark}y.\" [This]{.mark} then [leading them to attribute the
reality of behavioral activities that are genre-specific to the West\'s
Man]{.mark}]{.underline}** in its second reinvented
concept/self-conception as homo oeconomicus, ones that are therefore as
such, as a historically originated ensemble of behavioral activitiesas
being ostensibly human activities-in-general. This, in spite of the fact
that they do historicize the origin of the processes that were to lead
to their recent natural scientific findings with respect to the reality
of the non-naturally caused ongoing acceleration of global warming and
climate change, identifying this process as having begun with the
\[West\'s\] Industrial Revolution from about 1750 onwards. That is,
therefore, as a process that can be seen to have been correlatedly
concomitant in Great Britain, both with the growing expansion of the
largely bourgeois enterprise of factory manufacturing, as well with the
first stages of the political and intellectual struggles the British
bourgeoisie who were to spearhead the Industrial Revolution, to displace
the then ruling group hegemony of the landed aristocracy cum gentry, and
to do so, by inter alia, the autopoetic reinvention of the earlier homo
politicus/virtuous citizen civic humanist concept of Man, which had
served to legitimate the latter\'s traditionally landed, political,
social and economic dominance, in new terms. This beginning with Adam
Smith and the Scottish School of the Enlightenment in the generation
before the American, French, and Haitian (slave) revolutions, as a
reinvention tat was to be effected in now specifically bourgeois terms
as homo oeconomicus/and virtuous Breadwinner. 116 That is as the now
purely secular genre of being human, which although not to be fully
(i.e., politically, intellectually, and economically) institutionalized
until the mid-nineteenth century, onwards, when its optimal incarnation
came to be actualized in the British and Western bourgeoisie as the new
ruling class, was, from then on, to generate its prototype specific
ensemble of new behavioral activities, that were to impel both the
Industrial Revolution, as well as the West\'s second wave of imperial
expansion, this based on the colonized incorporation of a large majority
of the world\'s peoples, all coercively homogenized to serve its own
redemptive material telos, the telos initiating of global warming and
climate change. Consequently, if the Report\'s authors note that about
1950, a steady process of increasing acceleration of the processes of
global warming and climate change, had begun to take place, this was not
only to be due to the Soviet Revolution\'s (from 1917 onwards) forced
march towards industrialization (if in its still homo oeconomicus
conception, since a march spearheaded by the 116 See the already cited
essay by J.G.A. Pocock \"symbolic capital,\" education credentials
owning and technically skilled Eastern European bourgeoisie)---as a
state-directed form of capitalism, nor indeed by that of Mao\'s then
China, but was to be also due to the fact that in the wake of the range
of successful anti-colonial struggles for political independence, which
had accelerated in the wake of the Second World War, because the new
entrepreneurial and academic elites had already been initiated by the
Western educational system in Western terms as homo oeconomicus, they
too would see political independence as calling for industrialized
development on the \"collective bovarysme \"117 model of the Western
bourgeoisie. Therefore, with the acceleration of global warming and
climate change gaining even more momentum as all began to industrialize
on the model of homo oeconomicus, with the result that by the time of
the Panel\'s issued April 2007 Report [th**[e process was now being
driven by a now planetarily
homogenized]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[/standardized transnational
\"[system of material provisioning]{.mark} or mode of techno-industrial
economic production based on the accumulation of capital]{.underline}**;
as the means of production of ever-increasing economic growth, defined
as \"development\"; with this calling for a single model of normative
behavioral activities, all driven by the now globally (post-colonially
and post-the-1989-collapse-of-the-Soviet Union), homogenized desire of
\"all men (and women) to,\" realize themselves/ourselves, in the terms
of homo oeconomicus. In the terms, therefore, of **[\"[its
single]{.mark} (Western-bourgeois or ethno-class) [understanding\" of
\"man\'s humanity,\" over-represented as that of the
human]{.mark}]{.underline}**; **[with the well-being and common good of
its referent \"we\"---]{.underline}**that, not only of the transnational
middle classes but even more optimally, of the corporate multinational
business industries and their financial networks, **[[both indispensable
to the securing of the Western-bourgeois conception of the common
good]{.underline}]{.mark}**, within the overall terms of the
behavior-regulatory redemptive material telos of ever-increasing
economic growth, put forward as the Girardot-type \"cure\" for the
projected Malthusian-Ricardo transumed postulate of a \"significant
ill\" as that, now, ostensibly, of **[mankind\'s threatened
subordination to \[the trope\] of Natural Scarcity, this in the
reoccupied place of Christianity of its postulate of that \"ill\" as
that of enslavement to Original Sin.\"\' [With the result that the very
ensemble of behavioral activities indispensable,]{.mark} on the one
hand, [to the continued hegemony of the bourgeoisie as a Western and
westernized transnational ruling class, is the same ensemble of
behaviors that is directly causal of]{.mark} global worming and [climate
change,]{.mark} as they are, on the other, to the continued dynamic
enactment and stable replication of the West\'s second reinvented
concept of Man]{.underline}**; this latter in response to the latter\'s
existential imperative of guarding against the entropic disintegration
of its genre of being human and fictive nation-state mode of kind.
Thereby against the possible bringing to an end, therefore, of the
societal order, and autopoetic living Western and westernized macro
world system in it bourgeois configuration, which is reciprocally the
former\'s (i.e., its genre of being human, and fictive modes of kind\'s
condition of realization, at a now global level. This, therefore, is the
cognitive dilemma, one arising directly from the West\'s hitherto
unresolvable aporia of the secular, that has been precisely captured by
Sven Lutticken in a recent essay. Despite, he writes, \"the consensus
that global warming cannot be ascribed to normal fluctuations in the
earth\'s temperature\... \[the\] social and political components of this
process have been minimized; man-made nature is re-naturalized, the new
(un)natural history presented as fate.\" And with this continuing to be
so because (within the terms, I shall add, of our present \"single
understanding of man\'s humanity\" and the unresolvable aporia which it
continues to enact), **[[\"\[t\]he truly terrifying notion is not that
\[global warming and climate change\] is irreversible, but that it
actually might be reversible---at the cost of radically changing the
economic and social order]{.underline}]{.mark}**\...\"119 **[The
changing]{.underline}**, thereby, **[of the now globally hegemonic
biologically absolute answer]{.underline}** that we at present give to
the question to who we are, and of whose biohumanist homo oeconomicus
symbolic life/death (i.e., naturally selected/dysselected) code\'s
intentionality of dynamic enactment and stable replication, **[[our
present \"economic and social order\" is itself the empirical
actualization]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**Environmental destruction is a direct result of racial hierarchies
that incentivize increased consumption -- Their technological and
objective solutions for climate rests on the assumption of a politically

environmental racism.**

predominantly poor urban district of New York, points out, \[\*296\]
**[the simple fact is that [our]{.mark} current unsustainable

disastrous . . . . . . . \[A\]nd one thing is for sure\--Americans are
not doing all this overconsuming in congressional districts like the one

Americans to change their light bulbs, inflate their tires to the proper
tire pressure to ensure optimal gas mileage, switch to hybrid cars, run
dishwashers only when full, telecommute, or buy more efficient washers
and dryers. However, popular emissions challenge web sites are not
suggesting that Americans give up their cars, move into smaller homes in

**Western engagement in the name of providing human rights and democracy
only serves to perpetuate racist self-serving myths of poor, struggling
countries of the globe in need of a White Savior. This portrayal not
only masks the ineffectiveness of western intervention, but ignores the
root of poverty and denies real agency -- Haiti is empirical evidence**

Tragedy and White Man's Burden Redux," London Progressive
Journal, <http://londonprogressivejournal.com/article/view/628/haitian-tragedy-and-white-mans-burden-redux>)

[The January 12th earthquake in Haiti killed around [100,000 people and
many thousands more]{.mark} are [dy]{.mark}ing [because of the limited
ability of the Haitian state, and unwillingness of western
states]{.mark}, to respond rapidly and effectively to this humanitarian
catastrophe. The response to the crisis by the British media reveals
much about this country\'s ideological self-definition vis-à-vis the
global South in general and very poor countries such as Haiti in
particular]{.underline}. ¶ [[The focus of the media's coverage has been
divided between emphasizing the natural aspects of this disaster,
praising western aid agencies' attempts to help the people of Haiti, and
detailing the desperate conditions of the general population]{.mark}. To
be sure, western populations have been quick and generous in their
response to the crisis through millions of individual donations. But
this generosity of spirit is not matched by their governments and media.
Rather, [the crisis has become an opportunity to engage in the
reproduction of self-serving myths of western superiority and
generosity]{.mark}.]{.underline}¶ The Times branded Haiti 'The
unluckiest country' and The Daily Mail explains the devastation of the
quake as resulting from the magnitude of the intensity combined with the
epicentre's proximity to the capital, Port-au-Prince. Alongside such
'explanations', reports detail the courage of western aid
agencies. President Obama is quoted as promising 'unwavering
support' for Haiti. Published eye-witness accounts which began by
emphasising the desperation of the surviving population shifted, within
days, to salacious stories of looting. [[UN and American forces have
been portrayed as 'restoring order']{.mark}. ¶ [The narratives
constructed]{.mark} in the media's reporting and government reaction to
[the crisis have all the hall-marks of the white man's burden: An
impoverished (black) country, unable to self-govern, run its own
affairs and respond to the disaster requires generous (white) western
assistance]{.mark}; the world is ready to help - [but aid is disrupted
by an unworking Haitian state system and by thuggish (black)
looters]{.mark}; aid, therefore, [needs to be backed up by peacekeeping
and the restoration of order]{.mark}. ]{.underline}¶[ Very little
space in the mainstream media has been given to the original reasons
for Haiti's extreme poverty. To do so would undermine the myth of the
white man's burden and expose western powers' responsibility for the
country's underdevelopment]{.underline}. ¶ Haiti, originally named
Saint-Domingue, used to be France's most precious colony, its exports
making up around two thirds of France's gross national product. Between
1791 and 1804 the colony experienced a monumental revolution which
overthrew French slave owners, established the world's first black
republic and beat back French and British attempts to re-conquer the
country and re-establish slavery. CLR James in his magnificent book The
Black Jacobins details how re-invading French troops confronted former
slaves singing La Marseillaise, the revolutionary French national
anthem. James portrayed the slave revolt as representing the extreme
left wing of the French Revolution, not only fighting for an abstract
conception of Liberté, égalité, fraternité but for a concrete
anti-racist, anti-colonial recognition of the rights of the former
slaves to take their place as equals amongst other nations. The
United States, the self declared first anti-colonial nation, following
its own revolution against the British in 1776, did not supportthe
Haitian bid for freedom, only recognizing Haiti in 1862, a year into its
civil war. To have done so earlier would have meant confronting its own,
proliferating, system of slavery.¶ The victory of the former Haitian
slaves against the French and then British came at a high cost. European
countries refused to trade with Haiti, with France agreeing to resume
trade on the condition that the Haitian state pay former slave owners
compensation of 150 million francs (equivalent to around \$35 billion
today). [When, in the early 20th century, the Haitian state found it
impossible to continue repaying the loan, it turned to US banks for
help. The United States occupied the country -- from 1915 to 1934 -- to
ensure the repayment of these loans and to continue the expansion of US
business interests in the Caribbean and wider Latin American region. The
US then supported the murderous 'Papa Doc' and 'Baby Doc' dictatorships
between 1957 and 1986. But 'Baby Doc' Duvalier was overthrown by mass
uprisings in 1986 and Jean-Bertrand Aristide was elected in 1990 on a
pro-poor platform. But no sooner had he entered office than a US-backed
military coup overthrew him in 1991. The US then backtracked, supporting
Aristide on the condition that he implement neo-liberal reforms, and
restored him to office in 1994. In 2004 the US switched sides again,
backing a coup against Aristide]{.underline}. Since then the country has
been (in)effectively ruled by UN troops. ¶ Today Haiti is a disaster
zone. Jeffry Sachs' recent Guardian op-ed continues the process of
western myth-making in relation to Haiti: 'The world has spent heavily
in Haiti before, but very ineffectively. This time it must be done
right'. By ignoring Haiti's denigration at the hands of western powers
it is easy for the mainstream media and western governments to portray
the country's plight as a result of domestic mismanagement and bad
luck. It also helps in the ideological repackaging of the US military as
a Florence Nightingale of the Caribbean following its disastrous
interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan. And the amounts committed by key
western states, an £88 million aid package, in comparison to the US's
£400 million annual aid to Colombia, and the £9 trillion cost of bailing
out the world's banks, highlights well the priorities of the main powers
today. ¶ Is this to say that western powers can do nothing to help
Haiti? On the contrary. They could follow Hugo Chavez's lead of
cancelling, unconditionally, Haitian debt. They could engage in a 'shock
and awe' operation of raining down food and supplies on the Haitian
population. [But the white man's burden was never about helping the rest
of the world, but about advancing the interests of the key states in the
international system. Can change come from within Haiti?The country
has a rich history of struggle and rebellion against dictatorship
and there is every reason to expect the people of Haiti to attempt, in
the future, to establish a pro-poor, democratic system.]{.underline}

In fact, **[[the notion of American globality]{.underline}]{.mark}** I
have begun discussing here **[already [exceeds]{.mark}]{.underline}**
negri and Hardt's formulation **[[to the extent that it is a global
racial formation, and]{.mark} more pointedly a global [mobilization of a
white supremacist social formation]{.mark}]{.underline}** (read: a
united States of America formed by the social-economic geographies of
racial chattel slavery and their recodification through the post-13th
Amendment innovation of other technologies of criminalization and
imprisonment). The **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** prison regime's
[**[production of human immobilization and death composes some of the
fundamental modalities of American national
coherence]{.underline}**.]{.mark} It
**[[inscribes]{.underline}]{.mark}** two forms of
**[[domination]{.underline}]{.mark}** that tend to slip from the
attention of political theorists, including Negri and Hardt: first**[,
[the]{.mark} prison]{.underline}** **[[regime]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[strategically institutionalizes the biopolitical structures of white
racial/nationalist ascendancy---it]{.mark} quite [concretely provides
a]{.mark} definition for [white American personhood, citizenship,
freedom, and racialized patriotism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second,
**[[the]{.mark} prison [regime reflects the moral, spiritual, and
cultural inscription of Manifest Destiny]{.mark} (and its descendant
material cultural and state-building a[rticulations of racist and white
supremacist conquest, genocide, and population control)]{.mark} across
different historical moments.]{.underline}** to invoke and critically
rearticulate negri and Hardt's formulation, the focal question becomes:
**[[How does the right of the uS-as-global police to kill, detain,
obliterate become voiced, juridically coded, and culturally
recoded?]{.mark} the structure of presumption---and therefore relative
political silence---enmeshing the prison's centrality to the logic of
American globality is precisely evidence of the fundamental power of the
uS prison regime within the larger schema of American
hegemony]{.underline}**. In this sense the uS prison regime is
ultimately really not an "institution." rather it is a formulation of
world order (hence, a dynamic and perpetual labor of
institutionalization rather than a definitive modernist institution) in
which massively scaled, endlessly strategized technologies of human
immobilization address (while never fully resolving) the socio-political
crises of globalization. The US prison regime defines a global logic of
social organization that constitutes, mobilizes, and prototypes across
various localities. What would it mean, then, to consider state-crafted,
white supremacist modalities of imprisonment as the perpetual end rather
than the self-contained means of American globality? I am suggesting a
conception of the prison regime that focuses on what cultural and
political theorist Allen Feldman calls a "formation of violence," which
anchors the contemporary articulation of white supremacy as a global
technology of coercion and hegemony. Feldman writes, the growing
autonomy of violence as a self-legitimating sphere of social discourse
and transaction points to the inability of any sphere of social practice
to totalize society. **[[Violence itself both reflects and accelerates
the experience of society as an incomplete project, as something to be
made.]{.mark} As a formation of violence that self-perpetuates a
peculiar social project through the discursive structures of warfare,
the US prison regime composes an acute formation of racial and white
supremacist violence,]{.underline}** and thus houses the capacity for
mobilization of an epochal (and peculiar) white supremacist global
logic. This contention should not be confused with the sometimes
parochial (if not politically chauvinistic) proposition that American
state and state-sanctioned regimes of bodily violence and human
immobilization are somehow self-contained "domestic" productions that
are exceptional to the united States of America, and that other "global"
sites simply "import," imitate, or reenact these institutionalizations
of power. In fact, I am suggesting the opposite: the **[[US prison
regime exceeds as it enmeshes the ensemble of social relations that
cohere uS civil society, and is fundamental to]{.mark} the geographic
transformations, institutional vicissitudes, and [militarized/economic
mobilizations of "globalization"]{.mark} generally.]{.underline}** to
assert this, however, is to also argue that the constituting violence of
the US prison regime has remained somewhat undertheorized and
objectified in the overlapping realms of public discourse, activist
mobilization, and (grassroots as well as professional) scholarly praxis.
Here I am arguing that **[it is not possible to conceptualize and
critically address the emergence and global proliferation of the
(uS/global) prison industrial complex outside a fundamental
understanding of what are literally its technical and technological
premises]{.underline}**: namely, **[[its complex organization and
creative production of racist and white supremacist bodily
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is only in this context, I would
say, that we can examine the problem of how "the Prison" is a modality
(and not just a reified product or outcome) of American statecraft in
the current political moment. It is only a theoretical foregrounding of
the white supremacist state and social formation of the united States
that will allow us to understand the uS prison regime as an American
globality that materializes as it prototypes state violence and for that
matter, "state power" itself through a specific institutional site.

Kenneth Osgood notes that "the Cold War was first and foremost a
political war---a war of persuasion\... that would be won or lost
through public opinion more than military victory."74 **[[As the US
moved into a position of world leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}** during
and especially after WWII, [**[American politics and culture received
unprecedented attention from audiences
globally]{.underline}**.]{.mark}75 And especially in the wake of the
Nazi Holocaust, **[[the persistence of]{.mark} racial segregation and
[anti-black violence tarnished the US image]{.mark}, thereby [creating a
propaganda problem]{.mark} for executive agents in their quest to win
partners with promises of freedom and equality]{.underline}**.76 In The
Cold War and the Color Line: American Race Relations in the Global
Arena, Thomas Borstellman explains that **[rising demands for racial
justice were so loud, [US government officials "recognized that the
reconstruction of race relations]{.mark} along more progressive lines
[would be a crucial task on]{.mark} both [the]{.mark} national and
[international level]{.mark}s]{.underline}**."77 The Soviet Union
promoted itself as a genuine supporter of anti-colonialism, and lost no
occasion to shun the US for its anti-black racism in Soviet propaganda
campaigns.78 Despite personal proclivities toward white supremacy and
segregation, Truman and Eisenhower administration officials conspired to
depict the US as a progressive and egalitarian nation.79 **[[For these
agents, anti-black racism]{.mark} and the pervasiveness of Jim Crow
tactics]{.underline}** such as lynching, police and prison violence, and
segregation **[were [understood as geostrategic, rather than moral,
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Abroad, **[[US propagandists fostered
the perception that racial advancement in the US was outpacing
reality.]{.mark} The State Department organized goodwill tours with
prominent black American artists and entertainers]{.underline}**. For
example, the government-sponsored jazz group, "Jambassadors" (jazz
ambassadors), were deployed on high-profile tours abroad to help alter
impressions, bolster alliances, and persuade nonaligned states that the
US was different than European colonial powers.80 The CIA instructed
Hollywood film directors to remove negative stereotypes and "to plant
well-dressed negroes as part of the American scene." 81 Despite its
scant legislative or executive enforcement, **[[agents exploited]{.mark}
the US Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in [Brown vs. Board]{.mark} of
Education to its fullest, [citing the case as]{.mark} evidence of
[American repudiation of segregation. US propaganda highlighted
improvements for racial minorities]{.mark} in the areas of civil rights,
social mobility, employment, education, sports and entertainment,
business and government]{.underline}**.82 And while Truman and
Eisenhower felt real pressure, from internal and external forces alike,
to hasten these developments**[, [their challenge was to gain enough
headway to eschew charges of hypocrisy]{.mark} [while avoiding]{.mark}
significant [backlash]{.mark}]{.underline}** from Southern
segregationists, who constituted a powerful political base, or from
European allies trying to preserve their grip of racialized colonial
power.83 **[[When these acts could not be balanced, the reality of
structural racism in the US combined with expanding hegemonic ambitions
meant US officials ultimately catered to the]{.mark} more-powerful
([white]{.mark}, European) [forces]{.mark}, at the expense of

### Link -- Nuclear War

**Representations of future nuclear conflict rest on racist fears of
irrational non-whites---the bomb is the epitome of the destructive
capacity of Whiteness, naturalizing structural violence through the
projection of a spectacular extinction.**

**Williams '11** (Paul, lecturer in English at the University of Exeter,
"Race, Ethnicity, and Nuclear War", Liverpool Science Fiction Texts and
Studies, 2011, p.1-3- SG)

In this study, **[nuclear [representations]{.mark}]{.underline}** are
defined as depictions of the following subjects: (1) the invention and
use **[[of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the first atomic bombs; (2) nuclear
weapons testing stockpiling of the Cold War superpowers; and (3)
**[[nuclear war]{.mark} (often referred to as World War Three) and life
after such a cataclysm]{.underline}**. Nuclear technology **[[has been
the subject of narratives of racial and national belonging and exclusion
undoubtedly because its emergence]{.mark} (and deployment against Japan)
[was read]{.mark} by some commentators [as an act of genocidal racist
violence, and by some as the apex of Western civilization's scientific
achievement]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These opposing perspectives are
interpretative poles that have been central to nuclear representations.
By posing white moral and technological superiority against the
destructive technology it supposedly invented, cultural producers have
cited nuclear weapons as evidence against white Anglo-Saxon supremacism.
From this point of view, the scientific achievement of splitting the
atom does not reveal white superiority; instead, **[[the enormity of
nuclear weapons reminds one that the technology first created by the
white world imperils the whole Earth]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Through a
range of media, from novels to poetry, short stories to film, comics to
oratory, the **[[terms that modern European imperialism depended upon --
'civilization, 'race', and 'nation', in particular -- often recur in
nuclear representations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Some of these
representations, emerging when Europe's empires were relinquishing
direct control of their colonies, share the uncertainty that beset the
colonial powers following the uneven and often violent decolonizing
process[. **[The historical congruence of nuclear representations and
decolonization intimates the importance of this context to future
visions of World war Three: tropes of genocide, technological and and
scientific modernity, and the (re)population of the planet are
relevan]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[t]{.underline}** to this apocalyptic
subgenre of SF **[as well as being recurrent elements in colonial
history.]{.underline}** Several of the **[nuclear
representations]{.underline}** discussed **[reproduce the justifications
of the modern imperial project]{.underline}**. But an alternative
tradition makes these justifications visible and demonstrates their
corrosive, lingering presence in contemporary culture through the
depiction of nuclear technology and its possible consequences.
Significantly, **[[the idea that nuclear weapons are used to buttress a
racial order that privileges whiteness -- an idea that prohibits
non-white peoples from accessing such technology -- remains a potent
current running from 1945 until the present day]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Having raised this point to emphasize the importance of the themes in
this study, I am mindful to repeat that my focus is literary, cultural
and filmic texts. I am not seeking to explain how race and ethnicity
have structured Cold War history. If I may be excused a brief aside, I
do think such moments have occurred. Civil rights and Cold War
historians have long understood that **[US foreign policy had to
negotiate the American government's response to domestic systems of
racial discrimination, and vice versa.]{.underline}** Recently
decolonized nations whose populations had been excluded along similar
lines by European imperialism followed the narrrative of American
desegregation closely, and the allegiances of these nations played and
important role in the Cold War. When the black student James Meredith
was not permitted to join the University of Mississippi in 1962,
President Kennedy ordered federal marshals to force his registration
through. This took place on 1 October 1962, after a night of fighting
between demonstrators and troops. While not universally praised,
Kennedy's actions were widely perceived in the international press as
evidence to resolve to oppose racial discrimination. When the Cuban
Missile Crisis took place three weeks later, the presidents of Guinea
and Ghaa denied refuelling facilities to Soviet planes flying to the
Caribbean. Kennedy aside Arthur Schlesinger directly attributed the
African presidents' actions to the intervention in Mississippi. The
subject of this book is not the mechanisms of history. The subject of
this book is the way that **[[representations of nuclear weapons and the
world after nuclear war postulate meanings that are not only fully
activated when considered through a lens of race]{.mark}, ethnicity,
nationhood and civilization]{.underline}**. In many of the texts
discussed**[, a primary consideration is whether the vestigial master
narrative of white supremacy, [the narrative of racial superiority that
underpinned modern European colonization, is being
resuscitated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I have in mind Fredric Jameson's
expression, 'if interpretation in terms of \[...\] allegorical master
narratives remains a constant temptation, this is because such master
narratives have inscribed themselves in the texts as well as in our
thinking about them. For Jameson the interpretative act runs the risk of
being an act of hermeneutic bad faith -- the risk that the critic finds
what they are looking for all along because they gathered up a series of
texts whose selection is far from arbitrary, and consequently the
reading of said texts confirms the ubiquity of the historical essence
with which they were initially ascribed. Yet, as Jameson writes, one
should not be too cynical about the act of interpretation. If the
critical analysis of a text finds evidence of the historical trends it
set out to discover the success of the interpretation is not in itself a
reason to reject the idea that texts allow one to think closely and
critically about historical attitudes. The act of interpretation can
sometimes be the imposition of a preconvieved set of ideas onto a series
of texts chosen precisely because they corroborate the hypothesis being
tested, but it can also be credible because texts are inscribed by
history and by master naratives. As a way of referring to an explanation
of the movement of history and its future direction, Jameson's sense of
master narratives is worth retaining. My usage here designates the
explanation itself, specifically **[[the master narrative of white
supremacism that proved so useful to European colonialism and the
settlement of North America]{.mark}. How do texts come to be inscribed
by master narratives]{.underline}**? What justification do I have in
reading the master narrative o white supremacism and related narratives
of settlement through the literary, cultural and filmic texts analysed
here?

**The aff's threats of nuclear war come from a position of privilege --
Nuclear weapons are possessed by white elites and have been
systematically used to threaten/manipulate non-white populations.**

in the North [turned to new]{.mark}ly flourishing [black religious
movements]{.mark}.3 [Among them, the NOI]{.mark} was also a political
organization, [which evolved to be the most powerful Islamic
organization in American history]{.mark}]{.underline}**.4 In the
beginning, the NOI was small: its founder W.D. Fard traveled
door-to-door throughout Detroit, explaining to any willing ears his
purpose: he was an Arab from the HolyCity of Mecca on a mission from God
to reunite His lost chosen people and reintroduce them to their original
way of life. Mattias Gardell clarifies Fard's position, "the African
Americans were of the lost, but finally found Nation of Islam, the tribe
of Shabazz that had been stoned by the 'Caucasian cave man' or the
'blond blue-eyed devil' and brought as slaves" to North America.5 Only
one year after the first recorded activity of the NOI, Fard met a man
who would over the next three decades elevate the organization to
national, and even international, relevance.6 That man was Elijah Poole,
later to be known as the Messenger Elijah Muhammad.7 To manage the
growth in popularity and membership of the movement, Muhammad created a
bureaucracy, establishing temples nationwide, appointing administrative
officials, and organizing schools and paramilitary units.8 **[Between
1934 and 1955 the number of NOI temples increased from two to thirteen,
and by 1960 to over thirty.]{.underline}**9 In Elijah Muhammad's History
of The Nation of Islam, he outlines the purpose or goal of the
organization: "to reform our people in America and put them to
themselves in some place where they can go for themselves and do for
themselves."10 **[[The NOI invoked Islam as spiritual and political
resistance to the racialized violence of the Western]{.mark} political
and socioeconomic [systems]{.mark} in which they were forcefully
immersed. [NOI leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}**, most notably Muhammad and
his protégé Malcom X, **[[became]{.mark} [heavily involved]{.mark} in
the growing movement [against anti-black]{.mark}, Jim Crow [racism in
America]{.mark}.]{.underline}**11 But whereas their Southern Christian
counterparts, like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), prioritized integration, civil
rights, and equality under the law, the NOI sought separation from white
society in order to achieve independent black nationhood and
self-determination.12 **[[Islam was an appealing religion for black
people who felt disillusioned by the Christian church,]{.mark} its pro-
integrationist messages, and with white Christians' continued violence
against black people and black non-violent protest]{.underline}**.13
Sohail Daulatzai explains, **["[Islam was seen as 'the Black Man's
religion,']{.mark} an alternative form of a radical black
consciousness\... that was internationalist in nature."]{.underline}**14
NOI leaders understood Islam as a point of connection between black
people in America and the broader Muslim Third World, who experienced
overlapping struggles and diasporas as a result of globalized white
supremacy and Euro-American colonialism and imperialism.15

[white race]{.mark}."]{.underline}** 95 Chimerical resentment appears

[that]{.mark}]{.underline}** white supremacy should be appealing to
black people, or at the very least, that **[[black people should not

continue to keep them oppressed.]{.underline}** The FBI noted that "cult
members" regarded the US Federal Government "as an instrument of the
white race," as if it could reasonably be interpreted some other
way.**[[Rather than admitting that]{.mark} even some of [the NOI's
statements reflected the reality of race relations in American culture
or politics, the FBI characterized them as unprovoked and
unjustified]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In its analysis of the University of
Islam, the NOI's educational wing, the FBI claimed, "the subject matter
which was taught appeared to be of a fantastic nature quite outside the
realities of life."97 **[[Agents frequently referred to]{.mark} leaders
and members of [the NOI as "fanatical]{.mark}," suggesting their

rationalization]{.underline}**.98 **[[Portraying the NOI]{.mark} (and

anti-white politics and rhetoric of the NOI were motivated by a
pursuance of "Negro supremacy," or "a world in which the Negro will have
attained the enviable supremacy of the white man."99 In 1960 agents
surmised, "Elijah Muhammad, through his preachings of superiority of the
'black man' and his demands for complete independence from the white
race, has furnished many dissatisfied Negroes with a new pride and
purpose in life through the militant and arrogant black unity within the
Nation of Islam."100 **[[The]{.mark} dual rhetorical [strategy of
dismissing the racialized history of the]{.mark} politics of the [US,
while calling attention to the racialized politics of the NOI, fosters
an image of a black-centered politics based in a dehistoricized sense of
racial supremacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**; as if the racialized political
schema of the NOI transpired from the genes of its members, instead of
as reaction to the political and material conditions of black people in
a world colonized and dominated by white Europeans. In the 1965 foreword
to Elijah Muhammad's Message to the Blackman in America, Daniel Burley
observes a popular reaction to "**[label the spread of the Islamic
doctrine as espoused by Muhammad as a form of extreme\... 'black
supremacy,'"]{.underline}** to which he responds: Actually**[, Muhammad
is exposing Negroes for the first time to a brutal appraisal of their
actual standing in the American community and what they can expect in
the future from a system that under various disguises still grips them
in mental, physical and moral slavery and after 100 years of alleged
freedom]{.underline}** from the clanking shackles of southern plantation
servitude continues to lull them to sleep with false promises of a
bright tomorrow which never comes.101 While FBI agents construed NOI
rhetoric as deluded, unreasonable, and unfair in its assessments,
followers of Muhammad, like Burley, found truth in his pessimistic
outlook on the (in)capacity for the US

#### Just as slavery gained credence to separate personhood from the body through incorporation, the 1ac follows the lines of integrative corporeality that only creates new forms of domination under the guise of freedom which is the structuring principal for the stability of the anti-black social order

**Byock, 16** -- Ashley, Associate Professor of English at Edgewood
College, "Dark Matters: Race and the Antebellum Logic of Decorporation",
symploke, Volume 24, Numbers 1-2, 2016

At this early moment in the evolution of what would become a republic of
states, however, [slave bodies did not undergo decorporation in quite
the way they would through the processes of legal constitutional
interpretation in the first half of the nineteenth century]{.underline}.
This section examines how [legal interpretations of the Constitution
incorporated black bodies while exiling the volitional or agentic
aspects of liberty]{.underline} in Locke's sense. Within this broad
question, this examination makes the relatively limited argument that
[socio-legal (and corporeal) decapitations of black bodies became
systemic in the early to mid-nineteenth century]{.underline}. **[The
[establishment of white citizenship]{.mark} along [with the
broader]{.mark} [logic of political incorporation emerged]{.mark} with
and [through a logic of biopolitical exile that divided the black person
from them-self]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[American models of political
identity]{.mark}, agency, [sovereignty]{.mark}, governance, [and]{.mark}
even [corporeality were]{.mark} all [inflected in this period by the
delineation of]{.mark} [incorporated and exiled personhoods, and]{.mark}
this process [required the figurative decapitation of black persons in
order to construct an imagined rational populace]{.mark} that must be
protected]{.underline}**. Recent critical considerations of slavery,
colonialism, and resistance by Saidiya Hartman and Alex Weheliye, among
others, demonstrate the danger of [[attempting to]{.mark} [recuperate
agency through]{.mark} the figure of [resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}.2
We do this for so many reasons, and not least out of the desire to
reclaim will, action, capacity for rational citizenship, and
[self-emancipation from the persistence of mythologies of great white
emancipators and enlightened, liberatory founding
traditions]{.underline}. We [[have effaced the black matter that runs
through all our histories, and which has always supplemented and
facilitated these narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}. For this reason, [the
restoration of power, capacity, and agency]{.underline}---or of Locke's
"liberty" in its coupling of volition and enactment---[makes for a
compelling grounds for dislodging disempowering
mythologies]{.underline}. In her seminal work, Scenes of Subjection,
Hartman declares, "I do not intend to offer a comprehensive examination
of slavery and Reconstruction or to recover the resistances of the
dominated but to critically interrogate terms like 'will,' 'agency,'
'individuality,' and 'responsibility'" (Hartman 1997, 6). She argues
that [[black subjectivity was fashioned as a]{.mark} kind of supplement
or subsidiary but [defining term in the creation of]{.mark} an idea of
[free will]{.mark}]{.underline}: I examine **[[the role of rights in
facilitating relations of domination]{.mark}, the new forms of bondage
[enabled by]{.mark} [proprietorial notions of the self]{.mark}, and the
pedagogical [and]{.mark} legislative [efforts aimed at
transforming]{.mark} [the formerly enslaved into rational]{.mark},
acquisitive, and responsible [individuals]{.mark}]{.underline}**. From
this vantage point, [[emancipation appears]{.mark} less the grand event
of liberation than [a point of transition between modes of]{.mark}
servitude and [racial subjection]{.mark}]{.underline}. As well, it leads
us to question whether the rights of man and citizen are realizable or
\[End Page 53\] whether the appellation "human" can be borne equally by
all. (Hartman 1997, 6) Similarly, Weheliye argues that "**[[resistance
and agency]{.mark} \[as concepts\] [assume]{.mark} full, self-present,
and [coherent subjects working against something]{.mark} or
someone]{.underline}**" (Weheliye 2014, 2). He further asserts that some
[theoretical engagements with biopolitics have misconstrued the
racialization of personhood by understanding subjecthood or humanhood as
anterior to racialized interpellation]{.underline}. Instead, he suggests
a mode that focuses not on bios as such but rather on "[[sociopolitical
processes]{.mark} that [discipline humanity]{.mark} into full humans,
not-quite-humans, and nonhumans]{.underline}" (2014, 4). With this
problematic before us, then, can we proceed to think productively about
the systematic subjection of forms of humanity to systems of power under
the rubric of ostensible liberation without falling into the trap of
identifying modes of resistance and instantiations of agency as perhaps
some kind of antidote or recuperation or critical response? In the
period between the Constitution and Reconstruction, [legal definitions
of blackness and the boundaries set around black experience---rights of
citizenship, marriage, control over one's body, and so
forth---determined the material conditions within which bodies marked as
black could move, vocalize, express, recognize and be
recognized]{.underline}.3 Several abolitionist voices of the time
published books on slave law that sought to clarify and elaborate how
legal definitions of property, personhood, labor, and so forth had
codified race-based slavery in the post-founding decades. Texts such as
Stroud's Slave Laws (Stroud 1827, 1856), A Practical Treatise on the Law
of Slavery (Wheeler 1837), and The American Slave Code (Goodell 1853),
and demonstrate how profoundly legal decisions around slavery influenced
broader issues of constitutional law.4 These antebellum legal
commentators worried about the ways in which slavery figuratively
separates the slave body from any kind of moral identity or development.
Interestingly, a number of the cases in which this arises also turn on
some anxiety about threats to some form of economic or political
stability, in one case because acknowledging the inherent rights of
slaves would threaten trade with Spain and in another because a northern
court dared not alienate southern constituencies in a precedent-setting
decision for fear of inciting further national division. Many of these
antebellum slave law decisions explicitly sought to mediate between
constitutional precedent and contemporaneous realities, and through them
we can trace an emergent logic of biopolitics in the antebellum U.S.
This case law enforced biopolitical formulations of the populace
(Foucault's "society \[that\] must be defended," in a sense) to
demonstrate that [the imagined [security of this populace
required]{.mark} a [severing]{.mark} of [black]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[End Page 54\] [[corporeality from black
subjectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}.5 Wheeler, Goodell, and Stroud all
present some analysis of slave law's separation of the slave's body from
capacities of mind or character. Two years before the Southampton
Insurrection in southern Virginia, in a significant 1829 appeals case
presented before the North Carolina Supreme Court, State \[of North
Carolina\] v. Mann, North Carolina State Supreme Court Justice Thomas
Ruffin was forced by legal precedent into a finding that conflicted with
his anti-slavery sentiments. In this case, upon appeal Justice Ruffin
reversed the conviction of a white man, John Mann, who shot but did not
kill the slave woman Lydia, who was on loan to Mann for a year. Ruffin
found that according to law, even a temporary master may impose "a cruel
and unreasonable battery on a slave" (Finkelman 1986, 217). The question
of whether to convict depended on whether Mann was fully invested during
this year with the extensive rights of a permanent owner, in which case
the right to dispose of his property was fairly clear. Ruffin cites in
his decision "\[t\]he struggle...in the Judge's own breast between the
feelings of the man, and the duty of the magistrate \[which\] is a
severe one, presenting strong temptation to put aside such questions
\[as those presented in this case\], if it be possible" (Finkelman 1986,
217). Ruffin's struggle effectively dramatizes the problem faced by the
"ideal citizen," the rational white male, in confronting the moral
problem of slavery. Harriet Beecher Stowe notably cites the case as part
of her impetus and context in penning Dred (1856). But Ruffin's
**[[sentimental language]{.mark} actually [works to]{.mark} [repair or
suture the trauma that slavery presents to a white consciousness]{.mark}
forced to conform itself to the brutal legal logic of
slavery]{.underline}**. Its sympathetic logic circles back to the
unfortunate judge by way of the figure of Lydia as unfortunate slave.
Beneath that logic, Lydia's life and body are both legally and
rhetorically at play in a drama that effectively excises her
subjectivity from her physicality. Framed through the terms of
republican citizenship, Ruffin's reluctant finding acutely enunciates
how this moral and legal system not only bears but requires the
severance of slave subjectivities from slave bodies. Ruffin's decision
in State v. Mann turns on his assessment of slave subjectivity. Because
the slave is not trained to take up a place within the citizenry, he
rejects the idea of the master having the kind of authority that a
parent has over a child, "the tutor over the pupil, the master over the
apprentice" (Finkelman 1986, 218). There is an "impassable gulf" between
such examples and the case of slavery: "The difference is that which
exists between freedom and slavery---and a greater cannot be imagined"
(Finkelman 1986, 218). The youth born in freedom is "born to equal
rights with that governor, one whom the duty devolves of training the
young to usefulness, in a station which he is afterwards to assume among
freemen" (Finkelman 1986, 218). Should that method of social training
fail for this free person, the "ultimate correction of \[End Page 55\]
the law" is the ideal corrective. However, "\[w\]ith slavery it is far
otherwise" (Finkelman 1986, 218): The end is the profit of the master,
his security and the public safety; the subject, one doomed in his own
person, and his posterity, to live without knowledge, and without the
capacity to make anything his own, and to toil that another may reap the
fruits. What moral considerations shall be addressed to such a being, to
convince him what, it is impossible but that the most stupid must feel
and know can never be true---that he is thus to labor upon a principle
of natural duty, or for the sake of his own personal happiness, such
services can only be expected from one who has no will of his own; who
surrenders his will in implicit obedience to that of another. Such
obedience is the consequence only of uncontrolled authority over the
body.... The power of the master must be absolute, to render the
submission of the slave perfect. (Finkelman 1986, 218) Ruffin here lays
out in precise terms the biopolitical matrix that ensnares and
encapsulates the slave body. [The slave is "doomed in his own person";
that is to say, it is physicality---not least his capacity to
labor---that somehow seals her/his fate]{.underline}. Embedded in a
network of capital exchanges, **[[the slave's]{.mark} very
[corporeality]{.mark} [underwrites the master's]{.mark}
"[security]{.mark} and public safety."]{.underline}** **[It is [the body
that marks the division between freedom and unfreedom]{.mark}, and [this
body anchors character]{.mark} ("private person\[hood\]"; "usefulness";
"moral" agency; "natural duty"; "will"; "authority") [to a condition of
moral]{.mark} as well as corporeal [submission]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Ruffin thus elaborates his complaint against slavery in this moment as a
problem arising from the suppression of the capacity of the enslaved to
develop the kind of character necessary for a participatory
representative democracy---the kind of character that is shaped by those
whom this emergent individual will eventually replace as a responsible
citizen and whose errata, in the sense of Benjamin Franklin, can be
corrected first through discipline and, if necessary, through the
ordered system of the law. Nat Turner and Decorporation The many fates
of the body of Nat Turner tell us a great deal about how an idea of
Turner was interpellated into particular discourses around slavery while
at the same time demonstrating how "property" or "objects" might speak
back against power even as this power is exercised against and upon
them. As noted above, during the weeks when Turner was in hiding, his
name gained broad renown as confederates and witnesses related stories
of his prophetic visions and fearlessness. Once he was caught, tried,
and \[End Page 56\] convicted, he was first hanged and then decapitated
and allegedly skinned.6 Reports suggest that Turner's skull was sold and
resold for decades. In October 2016, what is thought to be Turner's
skull was returned to his descendants.7 Local Southampton lore in 1900
reported that Turner's skin was turned into a purse.8 Such stories have
been repeated from one source to another, and most often without
substantiation. Of note to the present study is the continual
re-narrating of the Turner rebellion and the storied decapitation and
removal of skin to create a purse such that this rebellious person is
insistently reduced to an object in and of financial circulation.
Narratively and to some extent physically, Turner's body underwent a
very particular kind of disciplining that reasserted control over his
body as a way of materially insisting on its signification. His
decapitation after death echoed the logic of slave law by which the
subjecthood of the slave, her or his head, is figuratively detached from
the slave body's exchange and labor values. [The severance of identity
from corpus under the logic of slavery demonstrates the inextricability
of the material from the discursive]{.underline}. [The modes of
personhood set out under the U.S. Constitution initiate the separability
of these two component parts in its three-fifths clause, which counts
(partial) bodies toward a system of representation designed to nullify
the citizenship and mute the voices associated with those
bodies]{.underline}. This [decapitation is part of U.S. systemic
biopolitics that is borne out in material practices of racialized
differentiation as enforced on bodies like Turner's]{.underline}.
**[[This logic]{.mark} [preserves the nature of]{.mark} a representative
[democracy through]{.mark} the [exiling]{.mark} of [certain
dangerous]{.mark} [individualities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What is
interesting here---in slave law and in its enforcement on Turner's
body---is the extent to which [**the [exiling of the]{.mark} [slave's
personhood]{.mark}** (as character or citizenship-capacity)
**[is]{.mark}** not only in contrast to but **[contingent]{.mark} [upon
the incorporation of the slave's body into the project of]{.mark}
supporting and "[secur\[ing\]]{.mark},"**]{.underline} in Ruffin's
terms, **[[the stability of the U.S. political
enterprise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A certain formulation of freedom
requires a concomitant exiling and unfreedom, and this is marked at the
axis of corpus/personhood. Narratives and rumors of the fate of his body
emerged directly after Turner's execution. The Norfolk Herald stated
that "General Nat sold his body for dissection, and spent the money in
ginger cakes" (Greenberg 1996, 90; italics in the original). William
Drewry based much of his landmark study, The Southampton Insurrection
(1900), on local communal memory in Southampton County, Virginia. He
asserts that Turner's body "was delivered to the doctors, who skinned it
and made grease of the flesh. His skeleton was for many years in the
possession of Dr. Massenberg, but has since been misplaced" (Drewry
1900, 102). In a footnote to this passage, Drewry notes that an "old
prejudice" against castor oil was long held "among the older darkies"
who feared that "it was 'old Nat's' grease" (1900, 102). Perhaps \[End
Page 57\] more compelling are the physical details Drewry provides in
another footnote: "There are many citizens still living who have seen
Nat's skull. It was very peculiarly shaped...Mr. R. S. Barham's father
owned a money purse made of his hide" (1900, 102). Although such stories
are generally impossible to verify, their truth is not at issue here.
Instead, the stories of the afterlives of Turner's body themselves
perform the logic of decapitation and disseminate the effects of its
decorporation. From Gray's dubious Confessions to newspaper accounts to
legal discourse around the rebellion, the problem of Turner's
presumption of agency preoccupied a whole host of white writers
recording the events of the revolt.9 [The official records from Turner's
trial position the insurrectionist as mentally unstable for imagining
himself as a prophet and in so doing violating the presumed
social-intellectual hierarchy]{.underline}. **[Turner's [presumption
to]{.mark} such [access]{.mark} to [knowledge]{.mark} and implementation
of subjective will [threatens to undermine a systemic
ideological]{.mark} [structure that underwrites the logic of biopolitics
by which governance of a society must defend itself against]{.mark}
dangerous [presumptions of liberation]{.mark} in order [to preserve some
version of socially ordered freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this
sense, it would follow Foucault's formulation of the emergence of what
he calls racism---as distinct from the most common contemporary uses of
that term---particularly in his lectures at the Collè ge de France.
Along with the other facets of biopolitics, [Foucault sees these
phenomena emerging during and in relation to Enlightenment discourses of

#### The state is the cause of the historicist cycles that subjugates civilizations under others -- the impact is the perceived subjugation of black culture under European culture

**Snead 81** (James, James Arthur Snead was a professor, fiction writer,
and film critic whose academic work analyzed literary modernism\"On
Repetition in Black Culture\"; Black American Literature Forum, Vol. 15,
No. 4; published in 1981; p. 148-149)

[The word [state]{.mark}]{.underline} (Staat) [[is]{.mark} not to be
[defined]{.mark} as a strict political entity, but [any coherent group
whose culture progresses from the level of immediacy to
self-awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}. How then do European culture and
black culture differ in their treatment of the inevitability of
repetition, either in annual cycles, or in artistic forms? [The truly
self-conscious culture resists [all non]{.mark}-[progressive
views]{.mark}; it develops]{.underline}. Hegel admits the category of
change, and even the fact of cyclical repetition in nature, but prefers
not to look at it, or if at all, then not from a negative \"oriental,\"
but from a positive \"occidental\" standpoint. In such a view, [Hegel
states: **\"Whatever development**]{.underline} \[Bildung\] **[takes
place becomes material upon which the Spirit elevates itself to a new
level of development]{.underline}**, proclaiming its powers in all the
directions 148 of its plenitude.\"\'3 [Hence emerges the yet prevailing
\"third option\" mentioned above as a response to repetition: the notion
of progress within cycle, \"differentiation\" within
repetition]{.underline}. So the first category in which [[European
culture separates itself from \"Oriental\" and \"African]{.mark}\"
[cultures]{.mark}]{.underline} is [[in its treatment of physical and
natural cycles]{.underline}]{.mark}. This separation into \"occidental\"
and \"oriental\" must seem amusing to anyone familiar with, among other
Western texts, Book XV of Ovid\'s Metamorphoses, in which the
\"pessimistic\" and \'oriental\" viewpoint appears in the lips of an
\"occidental\" predecessor of Hegel\'s, Pythagoras: Nothing is constant
in the whole world. Everything is in a state of flux, and comes into
being as a transient appearance\.... don\'t you see the year passing
through a succession of four seasons? \... In the same way our own
bodies are always ceaselessly changing . . . . Time, the devourer, and
the jealous years that pass, destroy all things, and, nibbling them
away, consume them gradually in a lingering death\.... Nor does anything
retain its appearance permanently. Ever-inventive nature continually
produces one shape from another. . . . Though this thing may pass into
that, and that into this, yet the sum of things remains unchanged .. . .
14 [The truth is that cyclical views of history are not \"oriental,\"
but were widespread in Europe well before the inception of historicism,
which began not with Hegel, but long prior to the nineteenth
century]{.underline} (and here one might mention as Hegel\'s percursors
Bacon or Descartes in the Enlightenment, the progressive consummatio in
the eschatology of Joachim of Floris, the Thomistic orientation towards
teleology, or even go back to the \"final\" triumph of the Heavenly City
of St. Augustine of Hippo). The debate in Western culture over the
question of the shape of history, for most of its course, has been
pretty evenly waged, with the advantage perhaps initially even somewhat
on the side of the cyclical view. [Only with the coming of scientific
progressivism]{.underline} (as predicted and formulated by Bacon in The
Advancement of Learning in 1605) [was the linear model able to attain
pre-eminence, and then not for some two hundred years]{.underline}. \'5
[[The now suppressed]{.underline}]{.mark} (but still to be found)
[[regarding of cycles in European culture has always resembled the
beliefs that **underlie the religious conceptions of black
culture**]{.underline}]{.mark}, observing periodic regeneration of
biological and agricultural systems.\'6

### Link -- Arms

#### The West's narrative of power and legitimacy as the leader of the international arms market is based upon libidinal phobias of being dominated and perpetual feelings of political vulnerability. Reject their hypocritical representations of instability and legitimacy: they're based on racist assumptions.

The problem of 'acceptance' of the existing international order in a
manner that upholds 'the existing structure of obligations' continues to
preoccupy the attention of the West even as it acknowledges that
'inequality is seen by the have-nots as less inevitable and acceptable'
(Kissinger 1957, 172--3; Hassner 2007, 463). [**There is concern that
'[power and legitimacy' of the international]{.mark} [nuclear order
'have been]{.mark} profoundly [modified in a direction unfavourable to
the West]{.mark}**[']{.mark}]{.underline} (463). It is observed that
'the authority of the West' has 'considerably weakened' and 'given a
rise to a general feeling in the "rest" that they no longer have to
accept and follow rules which they have not created and which they feel
are intended to perpetuate a domination which belongs to the past'
(463). [**[A perceived desire for 'new rules']{.mark}** and the
insistence that 'these rules [should be written less by a declining
"West" than by an ascending "Rest"' has generated **a sense of profound
vulnerability in the West'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (463). The West is now
perplexed that the rest in their quest for nuclear weapons is 'bound to
think that the American strategic establishment saw nothing wrong with
nuclear weapons as long as they were confined to the developed world and
has discovered their madness when they have become accessible to
newcomers' (465). While there is an admission that the NPT is an 'unfair
treaty' with unequal obligations there is a reluctance to address the
problem of disarmament and insistence on projecting a threat from the
rogue states (Krause 2007, 492). Any consideration of disarmament is
further mocked based on the lack of 'positive acknowledgement', 'little
evident domestic or overseas sympathy' and improbability of 'gratitude
and restraint' from the non-Western countries towards the British
experience of reductions in its nuclear arsenal (Schulte 2007, 505--6).
[[There is now a concerted effort]{.mark} [to]{.mark} '[forget]{.mark}
or downplay\...[the hypocrisy which prevailed almost without exception
among nuclear powers]{.mark}, and to a large extent also among
non-nuclear states, [about getting rid of their own nuclear weapons and
reaching nuclear disarmament']{.mark}]{.underline} (Hassner 2007, 462).
On the contrary [there is self-congratulatory mood in the West at the
maintenance of 'a certain balance of hypocrisy' that has yielded
'positive results']{.underline} (463). These positive results are
described by Pierre Hassner in the following words: 'The official
designation of nuclear weapons as illegitimate, the commitment to get
rid of them in an ideal world, the need to justify their possession by
some kind of alibi was a positive factor' (463). However, these
[positive results are now qualified by fears of an erosion of an
international political order based on 'mutual interests and shared
myths' that is now being 'poisoned by absolute hostility, or a search
for revenge, or at least an ever-deepening distrust and
contempt']{.underline} (463). These fears are compounded by a growing
realization that 'the traditional instruments of technology denial were
becoming less and less effective' (Krause 2007, 496). [[The **policing
of the international system**]{.mark} [by the West]{.mark} is further
endorsed in a tempered manner suggesting that, It is not necessary **to
assert that 'unreasonable' or 'rogue' actors with nuclear ambitions are
invariably 'evil' or psychopathic**, or that there will be many of
them.]{.underline} But such actors do currently exist and the
unpreventable possibility of others emerging cannot be omitted from any
consideration of the nuclear future. (Schulte 2007, 502) The
unwillingness of the so-called 'rogue states' or 'weapons states' to
comply with the existing norms of the NPT has encouraged further
deliberations on a range of measures such as preemption, missile
defense, counter-proliferation and so forth. [[The perpetuation]{.mark}
of enlightened hypocrisy [makes]{.mark} it permissible for [the West to
make the distinction between 'good' and 'bad' proliferators even if this
runs 'counter to the very logic of universal arms control
regimes']{.mark}]{.underline} (Ruhle 2007, 520). Thus the 'fixed hate'
succeeds in reproducing the '[repeated fantasy of the native as
in-between legality and illegality']{.underline} (Bhabha 1994, 166,
142). [The **entrenched mindset galvanized by the 'dynamic of
difference'** continues to dictate practices of regimes **based on
technology denial, forcible disarmament and
counter-proliferation**]{.underline} (Krauthammer 1991, 32 --33).

#### Arms are technology of political control. Western nations have used arms control to maintain economic and military hegemony over \"the Rest" and ensure technological dominance -- inscribing a racial global order.

The [[arms control system during the transatlantic slave trade was
partly made up by limited export controls by some of the European
suppliers]{.underline}]{.mark} and by national controls by African
leaders and state authorities. Given the large quantities of small arms
imported to Africa from the 17th century, and the [importance of weapons
in production and political organization, concerns with supplies of
firearms and ammunition were important factors in the internal and
foreign policies of states]{.underline}.49 Several historical analysts
describe systems of import controls and domestic stockpile management in
the importing states, managed by ruling elites. In the second half of
the 17th century, the Dahomey king, Wegbaja 'passed a law prohibiting
the sale of guns and powder, which suggests that muskets, matchlocks
according to tradition, were not sold to other inland peoples by Dahomey
traders'.50 According to Roberts, the centralization of firearms in
Asante depended on the king's success in controlling the firearms trade,
which in turn created political tensions between the king and the
aristocracy and subsequently lead to the stockpiling of firearms.51
During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, firearms spread deeper
into the lands behind the coast. This gradual dispersion of guns
coincided with the rise and consolidation of expansionist states like
Akwamu, Denkyira, Asante and Dahomey, whose military prowess was based
on the firearm \... . The bulk of the firearms taken into Asante and
Dahomey was not carried further afield, because both states imposed
restrictions on the distribution of guns in the lands to their north.52
Some evidence exists of centralized stockpile management in African
states. The very centralization of firearms was facilitated by secure
stockpiling of firearms by the central authority and through the control
of import of such weapons. For example, in Dahomey guns, powder and iron
could legally be sold only to the king. According to Robin Law, firearms
under the pre-colonial period were capital intensive due to low labour
costs related to their maintenance under central authority -- however,
as Law has pointed out, this was only true during the slave trade.
'Conversely, the lower cost of firearms, far from facilitating royal
control, might be argued to have facilitated the development of chiefly
power against the king'.53 [States introduced formal licensing
requirements on arms exports as early as the 16th
century]{.underline}.54 [Export controls on firearms were widespread in
Europe during the slave trade centuries to either protect limited
national military resources by preserving available
supplies]{.underline} (as in the case of France and Portugal) **[or to
protect a technological lead]{.underline}** (in England, Milan and
Lie\`ge) or because of a general ban on sales to the enemy in times of
war.55 In the 16th century, Portugal had developed arms controls
measures on its own, suggesting [[strategic reasons behind the limited
supply to Coastal West Africa at the time]{.underline}]{.mark}:
Officially, the [[Portuguese were forbidden to sell firearms to
non-Christians]{.underline}]{.mark}, ostensibly on politico-religious
grounds, but more credibly because, during the fifteenth, sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, Portugal was largely dependent on Flemish and
German gunsmiths for its supply of firearms.56 The Portuguese allegedly
seized smuggled weapons off the coast of Benin, and stopped a Spanish
weapon trading ship. At the same time, however, the Portuguese armed
several fortified trading stations with firearms in order to protect
themselves from attacks from other European and African rulers.57
According to Kea, the Dutch supplied 'firearms, powder, etc. only to the
rulers with whom they had commercial and military agreements', whereas
the English had a more liberal approach.58 [In England, France and
Germany, firearms were largely produced by small firms relatively to the
size of their markets.]{.underline}59 [[The rise of
mercantilism]{.underline}]{.mark} meant that private arms traders was
partly replaced by that of government arsenals and that [states
[encouraged a more restrictive approach to the regulation of arms
transfers]{.mark}.]{.underline}60 According to Keith Krause: From the
late seventeenth to the early 19th century the arms transfer system was
relatively quiescent. [Arms were traded, but the state by and large
controlled (or at least licensed) most arms production and exports,
keeping production near the level needed to supply only domestic
needs]{.underline}.61 The [European armament industry was during the
slave trade centuries confined to exports at peace times]{.underline}.
In times of war, demand for arms by the governments may have made it
difficult for the merchants to get sufficient supply from the
manufacturers for exports.62 In the 18th century, [it was a regular
practice for the government in England to prohibit the exportation of
firearms and ammunition in wartime]{.underline}. However, some evidence
suggests that domestic merchants had some leverage over the issuing of
export licences. Because small arms formed the backbone of English trade
to West Africa at this time, the merchants in the trade regularly
petitioned the government in times of war to grant them special licences
which made West Africa an exception to the general law.63 One way to
circumvent the export controls was by framing the exports as if they
would not constitute a military threat to the exporting state, while
being economically important. As one petition argued: '**[[the above
gunpowder and arms are of an inferior kind and have always been a
necessary part of the cargoes of ships trading to
Africa']{.mark}.64]{.underline}**

#### The arms market has always operated as a site of racial exploitation, in sale, production, and use. This racism was only magnified through industrialization, which produced inequities in military technology that allowed have historically been utilized to mislead, sell obsolete weapons to, and take advantage of black people.

[**The industrialization in Europe led to rapid advances in firearms
technology**.]{.underline} In the 1860s, [the breech-loader revolution
brought significant changes in the functioning of firearms that made
them more suitable for warfare: they were easier to load, fired faster
and were more precise]{.underline}. At the same time, the [first metal
cartridge bullets were developed]{.underline}, which protected the
gunpowder from rain and humidity and made firing swifter.[**67 [Fuelled
by the technological improvements]{.mark}**, [the]{.mark} [European
armament industry]{.mark}]{.underline} experienced dramatic structural
changes in the mid to late 19th century, '[creating the world firearms
market between 1856 and 1878', where [**Western Europe, Russia and the
USA were key exporter**s]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this process, large
companies moved from rail and general steel production into armament
production. Two examples were German Krupp and British Armstrong, both
pioneers in breech-loader.68 A number of studies have shown **[[that
Africa received very large quantities of obsolete weapons after the
breech-loader revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}**.69 In the 1860s, in
parts of West Africa one gun was imported per 103 people very year.70
Meanwhile, East Africa imported over 100,000 firearms annually.71 The
gun revolution penetrated Africa in a number of ways. [As the Europeans
rearmed with breech-loaders]{.underline} in the 1860s and 1870s, and
with repeating rifles in the 1880s, [they **discarded vast quantities of
surplus weapons**]{.underline}. Many of these found their way to Africa
by the coastal or trans-Saharan trade. In [[regions where Europeans
needed African labourers]{.underline}]{.mark}, as in South Africa from
the 1850s on, [[they often could only purchase these services for
guns]{.mark}.]{.underline} And wherever white settlers had modern
weapons, their black neighbours found ways to obtain them also.72
Firearms were well spread in East Africa in the second half of the 19th
century.73 According to Beachey: '[The arms trade in East Africa was
linked with the development and use of new types of fire-arms in
Europe', referring to **that East Africa received obsolete weapons from
Europe after the breech-loader revolution**]{.underline}. However,
shortly after the introduction of breech-loader weapons in European
warfare in the late 1870s, in the mid 1880s breech-loader weapons
started to be exported to East Africa at large quantities.74

[Parallel tracks of [United States government policy against the Black

more than incidental similarity, but [a]{.mark} concerted [fatal

people]{.underline}]{.mark} [globally [have **no economic value** short
of being unwitting consumers whose **labour-use has expired**, and whose
**resistance to social injustice must be repressed**]{.mark} at all
costs. This conflict of interests reveals a natural contradiction
between North American versus African or Black identities.
African-American on many levels is an oxymoron.]{.underline} This month
marks the 10th anniversary of the [United States Africa Command
(AFRICOM), created on 1 October 2008. [**AFRICOM is the re-colonisation
of Africa** by the US]{.mark} and constitutes the new scramble for
Africa]{.underline} equivalent to when, in the 1800s, the colonial
powers fought over which of them would dominate which parts of the
resource-rich continent. Pre-dating AFRICOM by ten years is its domestic
counterpart, the "National Defense Authorisation Act of 1997" [signed
into law by Bill Clinton and more commonly known as the 1033 Programme.
[The 1033 Programme]{.mark} [facilitates the transfer of]{.mark} excess
US Department of Defense [supplies and equipment]{.mark} to state and
local law enforcement agencies, [which are]{.mark} invariably [used
against Black and Brown communities in the US]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The
Programme has allowed police departments to acquire vehicles (land, air,
and sea), weapons, computer equipment, fingerprint equipment, night
vision equipment, radios and televisions, first aid equipment, tents and
sleeping bags, photographic equipment and more. [There is no more
glaring proof that the US has been **waging war against both Black
people within its borders and those in Africa** than]{.mark} a cursory
examination of [the responses by]{.mark} the [US national
security]{.mark} state to Black movements for decolonisation and
self-determination inside the US and on the continent]{.underline}. [A
parallel history in form and essence unfolds when comparing what took
place from the 1950s to the 70s in the US Black Power, Civil Rights
movements with the independence, anti-colonial movement in
Africa.]{.underline} Documented evidence vividly illustrates that the
[F]{.underline}ederal [B]{.underline}ureau of
[I]{.underline}nvestigation (FBI)'s infamous [Counterintelligence
Programme,]{.underline} also known as [[COINTELPRO, orchestrated
operations to "**infiltrate, intimidate, imprison, and assassinate" the
leaders of Black movements** for social justice in the US.]{.mark} In
Africa, [the US executed]{.mark} identical and chronologically aligned
[repression]{.mark} [through the]{.mark} Central Intelligence Agency
([CIA]{.mark}) [against]{.mark} the independent African governments and
[liberation movements sweeping the continent]{.mark}. No matter where in
the world African people are, our [organising for **social justice is
treated as a threat** to the]{.mark} political, economic, and cultural
[interest of the US]{.mark} ruling class that actually constitutes the
essence of Americanism.]{.underline} Democratically elected leaders of
the new African states were subjected to coup d'états and incessant
assassination attempts including that of Kwame Nkrumahin Ghana, the
successful assassination of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo, and today we
can add the 2011 brutal murder of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya[. [The need
to feed a growing and insatiable military-industrial complex and to
guarantee that no radical Black movements emerge within US borders or on
the African continent has given rise to increased and better-coordinated
militarisation both in Africa through AFRICOM and Black communities in
the US through the 1033 Programme.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[US]{.mark}
state agents [continue]{.mark} tantamount [treatment, like **spying on
B**]{.mark}lack **[L]{.mark}**ives **[M]{.mark}**atter
[activists]{.mark}, monitoring their social media [and creating
the]{.mark} bogus FBI designation [Black Identity Extremists to malign
them as responsible for violence against police. All the while
tolerating organised, **criminal infiltration of law enforcement by
violent white supremacists**.]{.mark} AFRICOM is the US response to
economic competition with China and its increased influence on the
continent. [AFRICOM is]{.mark} also [to prevent]{.mark} the emergence of
any [independent African influence or force]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is
not to fight drug trafficking or terrorism as stated in their
promotional materials. The US military presence is a destabilising
presence demonstrated by events like the 2012 overthrow of a
democratically elected government in Mali by an AFRICOM trained Captain
Amadou Haya Sanogo and the 2015 coup in Burkina Faso led by AFRICOM
trained Colonel-Major Gilbert Diendere. During this month the Black
Alliance for Peace has been rolling out its campaign US Out of Africa:
Shut Down AFRICOM urging all peace and justice loving people to sign the
campaign's petition directed to the House Armed Services Committee and
the Congressional Black Caucus. In his last year of office, instead of
doing what he could to abolish the 1033 Programme, Barack Obama put
minor restrictions on it, which the Trump administration immediately
reversed within its first year. The Bush administration, progenitor of
AFRICOM, was rebuked across the African continent when attempting to
establish the headquarters for AFRICOM on the continent, forcing the new
command to work out of Europe. Then came the Obama administration that
paved the way for the proliferation of AFRICOM on the continent, as
quisling African leaders fell over themselves to cooperate with the
first Black US President. A now acceptable scenario has resulted in 46
various forms of US bases as well as military-to-military relations
between almost all of the 54 African countries and the United States. US
Special Forces troops now operate in more than a dozen African nations
reflecting a 1,900 percent increase in the US military presence in
Africa. [What impact has increased militarisation abroad had on US Black
and Brown communities? Since 1990, about US **[\$6 billion
worth]{.mark}** of US Department of Defense property [has been
transferred to]{.mark} local, state, federal and tribal [law-enforcement
agencies]{.mark} while communities are suffering from austerity cuts.
The world saw [this deployed against Black rebellions in response to the
police shooting of an unarmed Michael Brown in Ferguson,
Missouri]{.mark}. The first actual militarisation of the US police
started 28 years before the 1033 Programme in the 1960s with the
creation of the Special Weapons And Tactics units --commonly known as
SWAT. In South Africa (Azania) the same thing was developed at exactly
the same time.]{.underline} [The Special Task Force (STF) was an elite
police tactical unit of the white settler regime's South African Police
Service (SAPS). [The first]{.mark} significant [deployments of SWAT and
STF]{.mark} units [were to repress African/Black movements for
liberation]{.mark}. On 9 December 1969 [SWAT was deployed for a]{.mark}
four-hour [confrontation with]{.mark} members of [the Black
Panthers]{.mark} in a densely populated area of Los Angeles. In 1967
about 2,000 [STF forces were deployed to]{.mark} guard the northern
border of Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) to [assist Rhodesian]{.mark}
security [forces against]{.mark} the [liberation]{.mark} forces
[there]{.mark}. Roger Morris, [former National Security staffer]{.mark}
for Henry Kissinger, [admits that of the]{.mark} dozens of [coup
d'états]{.mark} that have taken place [in post-colonial Africa **only
two or three** were free of]{.mark} the hidden hand of [US
destabilisation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The sale of small arms to "Black
Africa" was a policy initiated]{.mark} through Nixon's National Security
Study Memorandum 201: Increased Arms sales to Black Africa [to stop the
"threat of communism."]{.mark} Today the conditions they have created
are dishonestly used at the pretext for AFRICOM. Likewise [in the US, it
has been shown that the rise of]{.mark} so-called street gangs like [the
Bloods and Crips reflect a generation of radicalised youth misguided
after a decimated]{.mark} 1960s [Black Power movement]{.mark}. In spite

officials reject as unauthentic the "Study Response To Presidential
Security Review Memorandum NSC-46" that outlines a [deliberate]{.mark}
and sophisticated policy of fostering political [divisions between
"Black Africa and the US Black Movement]{.mark}."]{.underline} Measures
like: 1. Specific steps should be taken with the help of appropriate
government agencies to inhibit coordinated activity of the Black
Movement in the United States. 2. Special clandestine operations should
be launched by the CIA to generate mistrust and hostility in American
and world opinion against joint activity of the two forces... 3. US
embassies to Black African countries specially interested in southern
Africa must be highly circumspect in view of the activity ... opposing
the objectives and methods of US policy toward South Africa..." are all
arguably what has been US policy[. [The **double standards and
hypocrisy** of the US government are clear, making it imperative that

AFRICOM, confronting the powers that be about it; and that [[makes it

[[Afro-Pessimism is]{.mark} thus not **[against the politics of
coalition]{.mark}** simply [because coalitions tend **systematically**
to render supposed common interests as the **concealed particular
interests** of the most powerful and privileged elements of the

[seeks]{.mark}, in Wilderson\'s parlance, \"**[to shit on the
inspiration of the personal pronoun we]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" (143)
[[**because coalitions require a logic of identity and difference**, of
collective selves modeled on the construct of the modern individual, an
entity whose coherence is purchased at the expense of whatever is cast
off by definition. The subject of politics is **essentially dividual**
and there is in effect **always** another intervention to be made on
behalf of some aspect of the group excluded in the name of the

gesture **must thus be displaced by another more radical approach: an
ethics**]{.mark} of the real, a politics of the imperative, **[engaged
in its interminably downward movement]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
daunting task entails making necessity out of virtue, as it were,
willing the need for the black radical imagination and not just its
revisable demand. [[If **certain scholars** whose work has been
instructive]{.mark} or inspirational [for Afro-Pessimism miss this point
too, it may have something to do with the search for a method of gaining
agency that, while rightly suspending the assumption of an a priori
agent, nonetheless **rushes past the hidden structure of violence that

Kenneth Waltz may have surprised many of his contemporaries when, in the
inﬂuential 1979 publication Theory of International Relations, he chose
V. I. Lenin to be his key interlocutor.1 Rather than consign Lenin's
signiﬁcance to moral or ideological realms, [Waltz claimed that the
Bolshevik had provided one of the ﬁrst theories of international
relations in the twentieth century with his considerations on
imperialism]{.underline}. Waltz could also have looked closer to home.
There, an African American sociologist called W. E. B. Du Bois had
published a thesis (1915) on the imperial determinants of the First
World War one year before Lenin. Waltz might have also consulted more
closely the pages of Foreign Aﬀairs, the pre-eminent US journal on the
science of foreign policy. In its pages, in 1925, [Du Bois also
published an article entitled "Worlds of color" that revisited a
statement he had made over twenty years earlier: The problem of the
twentieth century is the problem of the [color-line -- the relation of
the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa]{.mark}, in
America and the islands of the sea]{.underline} (Du Bois 1961, 23). [In
"Worlds of color", Du Bois]{.underline} (1925, 423) [proposed that the
"[present Problem of Problems]{.mark}", namely, the global structure of
the exploitation of labour, needed to be re-envisioned with respect to
the "dark colonial shadow" cast by European empires]{.underline}.
Undertaking a comparative analysis of these empires, Du Bois (1925, 423)
noted that modern imperialism wore a "democratic face" at home and a
"stern and unyielding autocracy" in the colonies. [Du Bois argued that
the denial of democracy in the colonies hindered its complete
realisation in Europe. "It is this", he suggested to Western foreign
policy makers, "that makes the colour problem and the labor problem to
so great an extent two sides of the same human tangle"]{.underline} (Du
Bois 1925, 442). Ten years later, Du Bois (1935) wrote again for Foreign
Aﬀairs and delivered a prognosis that the Italian/Ethiopian war would
further inﬂame the global colour line. [In [these ways and more]{.mark},
Du Bois illuminated the crucial signiﬁcance of [race]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [racism as fundamental organising principles of
international politics]{.mark}; [axes of hierarchy and oppression
structuring the logics of world politics]{.mark} as we know it. [Though
questions of race and racism have been often side-lined to the margins
of contemporary IR]{.mark}, such issues were in fact integral to the
birth of the discipline. [IR was founded]{.mark}, in large part, [as a
policy science designed to solve the dilemmas posed by empire-building
and colonial administration facing the white Western]{.mark}
[powers]{.mark} expanding into and occupying the so-called 'waste places
of the earth', as the Global South was commonly referred to by
contemporaries]{.underline} (see Schmidt 1998; Long and Schmidt 2005;
Vitalis 2005; Bell 2013). Thus, within the Anglo-Saxon nations, and
particularly the US and UK, the ﬁeld of IR took ﬂight around such issues
as empire, imperialism and inter-racial relations (Barkawi 2010). The
discipline's 'founding' journal, Foreign Aﬀairs, ﬁrst published in 1922
by the highly inﬂuential Council on Foreign Relations, had previously
gone under the title Journal of Race Development (Vitalis 2010).
Additionally, South African scholar Charles Manning, Montague Burton
Professor of International Relations at LSE between 1930 and 1962, was
also a jurisprudential advocate of race administration both in terms of
the mandates system of the League of Nations and, later, South African
apartheid (Suganami 2001, Manning 1964). However, aside from Du Bois, a
cadre of black academics in the United States including Ralph Bunch also
engaged with these imperial discourses on race in this early period of
the discipline's history (Vitalis forthcoming; Henry 1995). Outside of
academic halls, of course, many anti-colonial writers from across the
globe were publishing cognate tracts critical of empire and race
administration (see, for example, Polsgrove 2009). Post-World War II IR
scholars occasionally discussed the importance of race and racism,
especially in reaction to -- or in the context of -- liberation
movements and Third World challenges to the West (see Isaacs 1969; Bull
1979; Vincent 1984; Mazrui 1968, Shepherd and LeMelle 1970; Rosenau
1970). [But race and racism seem to have receded in the subsequent
years, especially with regard to the many re-narrations of the
discipline's foundation and history that took place during the post-Cold
War period.]{.underline} According to James Mittleman (2009, 100), a
search of paper titles presented at the annual meetings of the
[International Studies Association (ISA) shows that the words 'race',
'racism', 'racialised' and 'racist' appear in only 0.37 per cent of
these titles (80 of 21,688 titles).]{.underline} Further, a search for
the same words in article titles appearing in ISA's premier journal,
International Studies Quarterly, between January 2000 and December 2007
reveal a ﬁnding of 0 per cent (0 of 260 titles). Indeed, one might
presently speak of IR's 'racial aphasia'--a 'calculated forgetting'
obstructing 'discourse, language and speech' (Krishna 2001; Thompson
2013).

This chapter [addresses the centrality of racism in international
relations ([IR]{.mark}) theory]{.underline}; speciﬁcally[, in realism
and liberalism]{.underline}, two of the most prominent paradigms of IR.
It [examines the extent to which these major paradigms of world politics
[are oriented by racist]{.mark} -- primarily, [white supremacist]{.mark}
-- precepts that inhere within their foundational construct, namely,
anarchy]{.underline}. I maintain that due to the centrality of anarchy
-- and other racially infused constructs -- within these prominent
paradigms, [white supremacist precepts are not only nominally associated
with the origins of the ﬁeld but have an enduring impact on IR theory,
inﬂuencing contemporary theses ranging from neorealist conceptions of
the global system, liberal democratic peace claims, and constructivist
theses as well]{.underline}. The essay proceeds in several sections.
[First, I brieﬂy review the centrality of white supremacism in the
origins of IR as an academic ﬁeld of study. Second, I discuss the role
of white supremacism in the foundational constructs of IR theory;
namely, the social contract theses that inform our conception of
anarchy, which is the starting point for most paradigms of world
politics. I maintain that [social contract theses that are often cast as
"race-neutral" actually suggest one type of relations for white people,
their institutions, and states]{.mark}, and another for nonwhite people,
their institutions, and states. This discourse provided the point of
departure for subsequent IR theorising among realists, liberals, and
constructivists on the relations among states in the global
system]{.underline}. Therefore, third, I discuss how [realism,
liberalism, and constructivism derive their notions of anarchy from
social contract theses which are based in a racist dualism that
dichotomises humanity and the relations of states comprised of diﬀerent
peoples]{.underline}. Before turning to this broader discussion, let us
consider the manner in which racism inﬂuences IR in general. [Racism is
the belief, practice, and policy of domination based on the specious
concept of race (Henderson 2007). It is not simply bigotry or prejudice,
but beliefs, practices, and policies reﬂective of and supported by
institutional power, primarily state power. For more than a century,
social scientists have maintained, in general, that race and racism are
among the most important factors in world politics.]{.underline} As
discussed to a greater extent in the introduction to this volume,
prominent antiracist scholars such as [W. E. B. Du Bois (1903, 23) had
acknowledged at the outset of the last century that "the problem of the
twentieth century is the problem of the colour line -- the relation of
the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa in America and
the islands of the sea". [Less appreciated today is the centrality of
race and racism to the core theorists of the incipient academic ﬁeld of
international relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Their early works were
ﬁrmly situated in the prominent social Darwinist evolutionary theses of
the day that assumed a hierarchy of races dominated by white Europeans
and their major diasporic oﬀshoots]{.mark} in the Americas, Australia,
and South Africa, with nonwhites occupying subordinate positions and
none lower than blacks. A white supremacist evolutionary teleology
informed the domestic and international policies of major Western states
and rationalised their policies of white racial domination epitomised in
slavery, imperial conquest, colonisation, and genocide]{.underline}. [In
this conception, [whites were assumed to be]{.mark} [favored by God and
biologically distinct from nonwhites]{.mark}. Uniquely among the races,
whites were assumed to possess civilization, while nonwhites were
assumed to occupy a lower stage of development characterised by either
barbarism or savagery]{.underline}. Further, it assumed that in order to
traverse the evolutionary ladder to achieve civilisation and its
attendant culture, nonwhites would have to be tutored by whites who
would -- often magnanimously -- assume this "white man's burden" so that
the lesser races might rise above their barbarism and savagery. The
lesser races were assumed to be not only biologically inferior to whites
but also in a state of almost perpetual conﬂict; therefore, the
"civilising mission" of those who would take up the "white man's burden"
could be imposed by force. This orientation not only rationalised
enslavement, imperial conquest, colonisation, and genocide but also
provided an intellectual rationale to justify these pursuits. [To the
extent that [the racial hierarchy guided the international politics of
the predominantly white states]{.mark} in their interaction with other
polities, then the international relations of the time were more
accurately "interracial relations"]{.underline} (Du Bois 1915; Lauren
1996). Thus, it is not surprising that the early works that gave rise to
the modern academic ﬁeld of IR focused squarely on race as its main axis
of inquiry.

Our understanding of events, as told by Schattschneider and others,
suggests¶ that the incident was not in any way a race riot. Such
[negation]{.underline} not only¶ [suggests the riot had nothing to do
with racism but altogether disregards the]{.underline}¶ [pent-up
frustration and rage of the African American community.]{.underline} The
reason¶ for this mislabeling, in my opinion, has to do with a
constricted understanding¶ of what constitutes a race riot. For
Schattschneider (1960), the event in¶ question failed to meet this
definition because "most of the shops looted and¶ 80 Educational
Administration Quarterly¶ Downloaded from eaq.sagepub.com at UNIV
CALIFORNIA BERKELEY LIB on June 26, 2015¶ the property destroyed by the
Negro mob belonged to Negroes" (p. 2). For¶ Mayor La Guardia and
Congressman Powell, the event was not a race riot¶ because there was no
"physical violence between Blacks and Whites"¶ (Capeci, 1977). In
essence, [[a race riot,]{.mark} according to these definitions,
[can]{.mark}]{.underline}[¶ [only occur if there
are]{.underline}]{.mark} [objective facts or [discernable evidence of
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}¶ [between two groups. Anything short of
direct contact or aggression fails to be]{.underline}¶ [included in this
definition.]{.underline}¶ **[By [refusing to label the 1943 incident a
race riot, individuals]{.mark} not only strip]{.underline}**¶ **[the
event of its racial underpinnings but [render its social]{.mark} and
political [significance]{.mark}]{.underline}**[¶
**[meaningless.]{.underline}**]{.mark} The riot becomes a mere conflict,
where chaos and¶ destruction ruled for a short period of time. In
effect, such reasoning leads us¶ to believe that the public boiling-over
of African Americans had little to do¶ with racism or the reality of
being Black in a White society. Instead, it¶ becomes an unfortunate and
isolated incident that simply got out of hand.¶ Moreover, **[[because
individuals failed to identify racism as a key
element]{.underline}]{.mark}**¶ [**of the riot, [White power and
privilege were]{.mark} protected and [reified]{.mark}.**
Because]{.underline}¶ [Blacks were not "rioting" against a White power
structure, there was no need]{.underline}¶ [to fundamentally change the
social and living conditions for African Americans]{.underline}¶ in
Harlem. Although the riots did open the possibility for increased¶
political representation for Black Americans, [[there was little]{.mark}
fundamental]{.underline}¶ [[change in]{.mark} social and economic [power
relations between Blacks and Whites]{.mark}.]{.underline}¶ As such, the
overall event and public protest did little to substantially alter the¶
gross social and economic inequities in New York City during this
particular¶ period in history.¶ How could Schattschneider---along with
other key political figures,¶ researchers, and scholars---not see racism
as an underlying cause of this riot?¶ [Why was this incident not labeled
a race riot, despite the fact that the collective]{.underline}¶ [anger
of African Americans was targeted mainly at symbols of
White]{.underline}¶ [power such as the New York Police
Department]{.underline}? How could Schattschneider¶ use an example that
describes blatant racial conflict without highlighting¶ issues of White
supremacy and social power? Answers to these questions¶ rest, in part,
on the fact that racism and its effects are rarely discussed or¶
acknowledged in society (Omi & Winant, 1986; Tatum, 1997; West, 1993a).¶
**[[There is a problematic silence that surrounds issues of
racism]{.underline}]{.mark}**---a silence that¶ is difficult to broach.
In fact, most people would rather not discuss racism¶ whatsoever because
the topic itself is uncomfortable and unpleasant¶ (Anzaldúa, 1990;
Tatum, 1997; West, 1993a, 1993b).¶ [As a result of this disquieting
silence]{.underline}, most [individuals fail to identify
its]{.underline}¶ [magnitude and breadth and limit its scope to
superficial manifestations like]{.underline}¶ [prejudice,
discrimination, and blatant intolerance]{.underline} (Delgado &
Stefancic,¶ 1995, 2001; Matsuda, 1996; Tatum, 1997). In fact, [[most
people view racism]{.underline}¶ [as]{.underline}]{.mark} [the enactment
of [overt racial acts]{.mark}---for example, name calling,
burning]{.underline}¶ [crosses, hate crimes, and so forth---[while
ignoring the deeper]{.mark}, often invisible,]{.underline}¶ [and more
insidious [forms of racism]{.mark}]{.underline} that occur on a daily
basis (Parker, 1998;¶ Scheurich & Young, 1997; Tyson, 1998).¶ In
addition, when discussions of racism do occur, people overwhelmingly¶
focus on explicit acts, believing that racism is perpetrated by "bad
people"¶ who dislike others because of something as arbitrary and
innocuous as their¶ skin color. [Although this type of blatant racism
certainly does occur, such a]{.underline}¶ [belief incorrectly assumes
that it is only found at this surface level and does]{.underline}¶ [not
penetrate our institutions, organizations, or ways of
thinking]{.underline} (Bell,¶ 1995b; Delgado, 1995a; Omi & Winant, 1986;
Parker, Deyhle, & Villenas,¶ 1999; Scheurich & Young, 1997; Tatum, 1997;
Williams, 1995a, 1995b).¶ This limited perspective, therefore, only
protects White privilege by highlighting¶ racism's blatant and
conspicuous aspects, while ignoring or¶ downplaying its hidden and
structural facets (Harris, 1995; Scheurich &¶ Young, 1997; Tyson,
1998).¶ Needless to say, **[[most individuals do not discuss the topic
of racism at all]{.underline}]{.mark}**¶ (Fine, Powell, Weis, & Mun
Wong, 1997; Frankenberg, 1993; Sleeter, 1996).¶ [[They ignore it because
they believe the topic is too unpleasant]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Anzaldúa,¶ 1990[**), [because they feel that racism is a thing of the
past]{.mark}** []{.mark}]{.underline}[(]{.mark}Bell, 1995b),¶ because
they do not see themselves as "raced" individuals (Fine et al., 1997;¶
Frankenberg, 1993; Haney López, 1995a, 1995b), or because they feel
that¶ the race problem is not theirs to solve (Tatum, 1997). Others feel
that because¶ they, as individuals, do not hold racist beliefs, then the
topic is somewhat¶ external and impertinent in their daily lives
(Frankenberg, 1993). In all of¶ these cases, such
beliefs---[individually and collectively---domesticate and]{.underline}¶
[minimize the role of race and racism in the larger social
order]{.underline}

Although it is now a commonly accepted truth that race and racial
difference has no cultural, or scientific/biological basis, race has a
social truth that has been buttressed by and reflected through history
and power. That social truth came from meanings that have been assigned
over time to certain physical features of the body---the shape of the
head, skin color, hair texture, eye shape, and body type**[.
[Perpetuating]{.mark} the meanings and [values attributed]{.mark} to
these [physical features]{.mark} [is]{.mark}/was [an expression of
power. This means that Western definitions of race traveled
wherever]{.mark} powerful [Western states have]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Yet, as Dikotter has pointed out, an **[[awareness of a]{.mark}
classificatory [hierarchy based on]{.mark} relative [skin color existed
in China long before the arrival of]{.mark} Euro-American missionaries
and [colonialists]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Stories of **[contact between
the Chinese and Africans]{.underline}** from the Tang (618--907) and
Song (960--1279) Dynasties **[are part of the historical
narrative]{.underline}**. There is the story of Du Huan, an officer in
the Tang Dynasty, who wrote about his travels in Africa (possibly
Eritrea) in the 8th century. According to other narratives, Canton was
already the site of an Islamic trading enclave by the 10th and 11th
centuries and interest in the lands in the "southwest", as Africa was
referred to, was growing. With trade as the primary purpose of these
exchanges, **[merchants of the Tang and Southern Sung Dynasties wrote of
their initial disappointment with these regions]{.underline}**, but by
the 13th century, opportunities for trade seemed more favorable. This
increasingly favorable impression led to expanded economic interest.
**[[Chinese writers]{.mark} of the time began [describing
African]{.mark}]{.underline}** wildlife, the landscape, and the nomadic
**[[people]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the east African coast.
**[Descriptions focusing on skin-color appeared [as]{.mark} early at the
4th century and there seems to have been a time when [dark-skinned
persons were presented]{.mark} to the Chinese imperial court [as
slaves,]{.mark} called "Kunlun"]{.underline}** (initially meaning
"\...primeval chaos"\.... and then coming to mean something close to
"\...peoples from a magical western mountain\..."). The Chinese
Columbus, Zheng He, arrived in the 15th century and trade and Chinese
exploration of Africa accelerated. **[The repeated telling of these
stories shows how the Chinese incorporated Africans into their
cosmology.]{.underline}** The Chinese held a belief of the cosmological
ordering of the universe that included a structured a hierarchy of
civilizations with the Chinese imperial order at the core and placed
other civilizations in descending degrees of civilization radiating in
concentric circles out from this core. Notions of skin color mapped
these radiating circles of civilization. But these ideas about skin
color and the recognition of skin color differences were not absolute;
attaining civilization defined skin color. At this time, China did not
share the absolutist notions of skin color of the European Enlightenment
not did they believe that the state was a container for those
differences. For example, the Chinese imperial clan was thought of as
"white" because white was the center of the civilized world. Chinese
laborers were considered uncivilized and, therefore, black.4 In this
discursive field, those from the Kunlun, the outskirts of the known
world, would be described as black. So, skin color and a sense of racial
hierarchy mapped onto a spatial hierarchy based on civilizational
attainment. Initially, Europeans, coming from a place far from the
civilizational core, were considered just as strange as Africans. Yet,
**[the addition of Western notions of racial identity and difference
should not be minimized Beginning with the late imperial era, [the
confluence of Chinese notions of the civilizational basis of fundamental
difference and Western racial classification hierarchy shaped the
discourse surrounding the]{.mark} creation of the [modern
state]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The questions to ask interrogate the
understandings of China's 19th and 20th century reformers and
revolutionaries, like Kang Youwei \[康有为\] (1858--1927), Liang Qichao
\[梁启超\] (1873--1929), Sun Yatsen \[X中山\] (1866--1925), and Mao
Tsetung \[毛泽东\] (1893--1976) and Zhou Enlai \[周恩来\] (1898--1976)
about the role of race and racial difference to the global order as they
attempted to construct a modern Chinese political order. Did they see a
racialized picture of global difference, hierarchy and power? Did race
and racial difference play a role in their understanding of the modern
state form? Did that racialized understanding influence the form of the
modern state in China? **[The concept of the modern state as a sovereign
participant in a global community of Westphalian states was a raced
concept]{.underline}**. Enlightenment thinkers like Kant, Linnaeus, and
Locke believed that there was a direct association between appearance,
culture, and political acumen and the capacity for self-rule. **[Used as
the premise for scientific classification, European [whites were
defined]{.mark}]{.underline}** (by European whites) **[[as being]{.mark}
the most [advanced]{.mark} group and, despite the differences between
various groups within the white group, inhabited and controlled the most
powerful states.]{.underline}** Coinciding with Europe's transition from
feudalism to capitalism, this concept was used to justify their control
not just of the territory where they lived but also their expansion to
lands far from their capitals. European power, expressed by their
expansion beyond their territorial borders, also spread and imposed the
meaning of sovereignty and ideas about those who were not worthy of nor
ready for self-rule. Their power also served to inculcate the meaning
and relevance of the inferiority to those they ruled over. This created
a psychological feedback loop whereby the inequalities created by racial
classifications increasingly reflected economic inequalities. As Baum
has written, "\...it \[was\] not race that \[gave\] rise to inequality
but inequality that \[gave\] rise to race\..." **[The American and
European states with ethnically and racially diverse populations were,
nonetheless, politically, economically, and socially dominated by those
who based their claims on their European descent and their proof was
white skin color. We[stern notions of "race" entered the minds of the
Chinese elites i]{.mark}n two ways. First, [elites]{.mark} in Japan
[attempted to answer]{.mark} the critical question: [what was the secret
of white Europe?]{.mark}]{.underline}** It was in Japan that many exiled
Chinese reformers, fleeing from the Empress Dowager's coup after the 100
Days reforms of 1898, first encountered translations of Western
political and social philosophical texts on the use of Spencerian
Darwinism to understand the international political order.
**[[They]{.mark} also [defined the modern state]{.mark} form [as the
central vehicle for national survival]{.mark} in the global struggle for
dominance]{.underline}**.6 Reading both Darwin's writings and the
commentaries that (mis)used Darwin to analyze con- temporary societies
and politics, **[Liang began to write about a global race competition
between states [in neo-Darwinist terms]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For the
groups to successfully compete with one another, they had to accentuate
their ability to unite together for a common purpose or goal. **[[What
created this ability to group? The recognition of a common
essence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Kang and Liang, along with other
reformers used the term "tongzhong" (同种), meaning similar kind or
similar/same seed, to describe this sense of groupness. Skin color
seemed to be a visible manifestation of the ability to group. **[The
second way that [Western notions of race entered the Chinese
society]{.mark} was [through]{.mark} [Westerners living]{.mark} and
working [in China]{.mark}. They circulated ideas about skin color as
race, identity as singular and fixed, culture as inheritable that were
translated into notions of superior state power.]{.underline}** Western
missionaries in mission schools, for example, taught that the ability to
politically group as a nation was a manifestation of race. According to
Dikotter, these missionaries even taught their students how to recognize
the characteristic colors of the world's races, with the Chinese,
Japanese, and Filipinos as the "yellow" race, the Europeans as "white",
Africans and the American slave population, as "black". They taught
about the hierarchical order of races, with whites and North
American/European states at the top and blacks, held in slavery in the
West and colonized in territorial Africa, at the bottom.

hall.]{.underline} We are concerned about the conflict in Ukraine, by
the massing of Russian troops near Ukraine's eastern border and U.S. and
NATO troops and planes in neighboring Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia, which signal the return of the Cold War and the threat of a
much hotter war. A defining period in the history of UE was our union's
courageous opposition to the Cold War[. At the end of World War II there
was great hope among union members and other Americans for a
continuation of FDR's New Deal, with progressive social and economic
policies including national healthcare, expanded Social Security, and
progress against racial discrimination in employment. What we got
instead was the anti-union Taft-Hartley Act and the Cold War. Military
spending, including the nuclear arms race, continued to trump all other
priorities. [Local conflicts all over the world were treated as
global]{.mark} [showdowns between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. In the name
of "fighting communism," the U.S. sided with the French and British
colonial empires against independence movements, and backed many brutal
dictators against their own people]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
40-year-long Cold War included some very hot wars -- notably Korea and
Vietnam. [[The CIA organized coups that overthrew democratic
governments]{.mark} that dared to disagree with the U.S. government or
corporations. On the domestic front, the Cold War was a massive attack
on civil liberties and an effort to wipe out organizations, including
UE, that refused to enlist in the Cold War.]{.underline} UE said the
U.S. government should direct its resources toward making life better
for its own people. UE favored negotiations to resolve differences
between the U.S. and the Soviets, and to end conflicts such as Vietnam.
[[UE said the arms race robbed human needs on both sides of the Cold War
divide]{.mark}. As UE President Albert Fitzgerald often said, "You can't
have guns and butter."]{.underline} The Cold War supposedly ended with
the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, which had been
composed of the U.S.S.R. and its Eastern European allies. A key event
was the 1990 agreement between the U.S., West Germany and the Soviet
Union allowing the reunification of Germany. In those negotiations,
President George H.W. Bush promised Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
that NATO -- the U.S.-led anti-Soviet military alliance -- would not
expand any further east than Germany. Yet despite that promise, and
despite Russia and its former allies no longer having communist
governments, NATO has moved steadily eastward toward Russia. NATO now
includes the former socialist states of Hungary, Poland, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria, as well as three
former republics of the U.S.S.R. which border Russia -- Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia. Two more former Soviet republics, Ukraine and
Georgia, have been promised eventual NATO membership. NATO is now
clearly an alliance against Russia, sitting on Russia's doorstep. In
late 2013 the U.S. began expressing hostility toward Ukrainian President
Viktor Yanukovych, and sympathy with the often violent anti-government
protestors in Kiev. Yanukovych was not an exemplary leader -- we now
know that he'd been feathering his own nest -- but he was elected in a
fair election, and [[the U.S. supports many governments that are more
corrupt and undemocratic]{.mark} than his. What made Yanukovych a target
for regime change was his decision in November to reject harsh loan
terms from the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF)
-- including the kind of pension cuts and austerity that have driven
Greece into poverty]{.underline}. Yanukovych instead accepted a more
favorable offer of economic aid from Russia. His proposal that Ukraine
have good economic relations with both Russia and the EU was rejected by
the EU and the U.S., which wanted a Ukrainian government hostile to
Russia. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland met in
December 2013 with Oleh Tyahnybok, head of the far-right Svoboda Party.
[In a 2012 resolution the European Parliament had called Svoboda
"racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic" and appealed to democratic parties
in Ukraine "not to associate with, endorse or form coalitions with this
party." In May 2013 the World Jewish Congress labeled Svoboda "neo-Nazi"
and called for the party to be banned. [Svoboda leader]{.mark} Tyahnybok
has [called for ridding Ukraine of the influence of "the Moscow-Jewish
mafia]{.mark}." [Svoboda is also anti-gay, anti-black, and hostile to
equal rights for women]{.mark}]{.underline}. But since the overthrow of
Yanukovych, Svoboda holds four cabinet ministries in Ukraine's
"provisional government" (including deputy prime minister.) In a Feb. 4
conversation caught on tape, Nuland and the U.S. ambassador to Kiev
discussed who would get which positions in the new government, including
cabinet seats for Svoboda. [In Europe since the end of World War II,
there has been a political taboo against allowing fascist and neo-Nazi
parties into any government. The Obama administration has now broken
that taboo and allied our country with fascists in Ukraine.]{.underline}
According to German media reports, about 400 elite mercenaries from the
notorious U.S. private security firm Academi (formerly Blackwater) are
taking part in Ukrainian military operations against anti-government
protesters in southeastern Ukraine. News that Vice President Joe Biden's
son Hunter Biden has joined the board of directors of Ukraine's largest
private gas company adds the element of conflict of interest[[. Obama's
policies toward Ukraine and Russia have significantly increased the
chances of military confrontation between the U.S. and Russia, the
world's two nuclear superpowers.]{.underline}]{.mark} This threatens
world peace. It is unclear whether the presidential election conducted
on May 25, under conditions of near-civil war, will help to defuse the
crisis in Ukraine. We reaffirm UE's historic position. We favor peace
and friendly, equitable economic relations between nations. We favor
negotiations rather than military confrontation to resolve disputes,
including this one. We believe the countries that defeated Nazism in
World War II, including the U.S. and Russia, should work together
against any resurgence of racism, anti-semitism and fascism in Europe.

### Link -- Taiwan

#### Taiwan is antiblack and allowing China sovereignty over it only reinforces tropes of criminality.

**Black Youth Project**, 7-17-20**14**, \"Black Lives Matter, Taiwan\'s
\'228 Incident,\' and the Transnational Struggle For Liberation,\" Black
Youth Project,

Someone was selling cigarettes illegally[. The State didn't need the
money, but it did want to be in control of how everyday citizens made
money. When the authorities showed up, the enforcers could have let the
sale of contraband cigarettes go, but they didn't. Instead, they used
force and the cigarette seller ended up on the ground. Not long after, a
man was dead. On first thought, this sounds like it's just the story of
Eric Garner's death on July 17, 2014 in New York City, USA. But Eric
Garner's story resonates across the continents and the
decades]{.underline}. The story above could have been describing not his
death but instead an incident that occurred decades earlier in another
hemisphere, with the death of an unnamed man in a crowd that gathered
when the cigarette seller was attacked by police on February 27, 1947 in
Taipei, Taiwan. [In other words, what happened to Eric Garner and what
has happened to Black Americans so many times is, in fundamental ways,
not that different from how the Taiwanese 228 Incident --- as it is
known for the mass violence that started on February 28 ---
began.]{.underline} On February 27, 1947, representatives from the
recently self-installed Republic of China government in Taiwan went to a
tea shop to confiscate cigarettes from a woman who had been selling them
illegally. The authorities hit her in the head with the butt of a gun
and injured her, causing a crowd to form. An agent shot into the crowd,
killing one bystander. Thus began a night of unrest that would be
quelled in the subsequent months and years through extreme violence. The
exact number of Taiwanese who were disappeared is not known, but it is
believed 30,000 or more people were murdered and many others who were
incarcerated for decades before returning unrecognizable to their
families. Until democratization in the 1990s, the name of the 228
incident was whispered in hushed tones out of earshot of the Kuomintang
(KMT) party dictatorship that outlawed discussion of it. Those who did
ended up in jail, executed, or disappeared. For 50 years, Taiwan
survived and mourned the subsequent White Terror, in which an estimated
tens of thousands of Taiwanese were murdered by the KMT's colonial
forces and many more were imprisoned for a decade or longer. All of this
because the KMT had occupied the island of Taiwan while it planned to
wrest control of China from the communist People's Republic[. Two-thirds
of a century after the 228 Incident and it can feel like the election of
President Donald Trump means talking about the death of Eric Garner ---
and all the other Black folk who have been murdered extrajudicially by
police and vigilantes --- will soon become outlawed. We cannot utter the
words "Black Lives Matter," that simple declaration of humanity, without
risking physical assault, paramilitary oppression by police forces, and
white supremacist vandalism. And though the story of oppression and
silencing is familiar, [Taiwan's history]{.mark} also demonstrates the
power of remembering our history and speaking the names of the fallen.
The first generation to grow up in a Taiwan where the 228 Incident was
publicly acknowledged became the Sunflower Movement of 2014, occupying
their country's parliament until it became impossible for the KMT to
capitulate to economic domination from the People's Republic of China,
sometimes mistakenly known as "the Mainland," as if Taiwan is an
province of China, not an independent national community]{.underline}.
This same generation began 2016 by helping to usher in the electoral
victory of Taiwan's first woman president --- Tsai Ing-wen --- from a
party that has long opposed the KMT's colonial and pro-China unification
agendas. It has been an emboldened movement of Taiwanese youth, raised
by families and communities who urged them to remember and make right
past injustices, who have the led the charge to dismantling the
political, economic, and cultural legacy of half a century of a
right-wing dictatorship. [Yet, as we end 2016, it's hard to envy
President Tsai Ing-wen, who now finds that holding hands with Taiwan's
long time military ally, the United States, involves having phone
conversations with President-elect Donald Trump. [The]{.mark} very
[fascism]{.mark} that [President]{.mark} Tsai [was elected to confront
now threatens the one ally that stands between Taiwan's independence and
China's territorialism]{.mark}. White Americans and [the media
establishment]{.mark} continuously wring their hands over [the question
of whether the]{.mark} [rising spectre of American fascism is due to
racism or economic discontent]{.mark}. For many of us in the Black
community, this is not a question because we know [white
supremacy]{.mark} when we see it. However, not enough has been said, in
light of the death of Eric Garner and others like him, about the
intersection of economics and race: the uses and abuses of economic
regulations as a form of colonialism and control. State power uses the
excuse of regulating the marketplace as a tool for furthering control of
oppressed and disempowered communities. [This strategy can be seen
clearly in both the historical "228 Incident" in Taiwan and the murder
of Eric Garner]{.mark}. [The linkages between the struggle of Black
Americans for civil and human rights and the movement of Taiwanese that
has led to a people-powered collectivist movement is deeper than one of
just both having experienced violent military and paramilitary
control]{.mark}. It is a shared history of being subjected to radical
authoritarian nationalism, or fascism: an ideology that seeks to order
society through political violence, war, and imperialism, especially by
controlling the freedom of those ethnic or racial groups deemed inferior
to work and live. The strains of fascism within American policy are most
obvious in the military-industrial complex and its domestic
predecessors. In the case of the former, a nationalist economy benefits
from the sales of arms and war abroad, enriching Americans at the
expense of the residents of countries considered to be inferior. For
example, U[.S. imperialist policy sanctioned the colonization of Taiwan
by the KMT from China. The subsequent killing of tens of thousands of
Taiwanese was irrelevant to an American establishment focused on
domination. This intentional effect of U.S. imperialism draws from the
legacy of anti-Black racism, a project of controlling Black communities
through State-sanctioned violence]{.mark}. From the inception of white
colonization of, what is now, the United States, [white nationalism has
been comfortable declaring war on indigenous, Brown, and Black
bodies,]{.mark} a war that has created jobs for weapons manufacturers,
slave catchers, and now paramilitary-like police. For Black Americans,
one possible takeaway is that anti-fascist efforts require a
multi-pronged strategy.]{.underline} Over the decades of martial law,
Taiwanese campaigners for democracy used grassroots, legal, and
electoral strategies in tandem to push for change. Each approach creates
openings in the others. The grassroots Sunflower Movement, for example,
gave rise to the independent New Power Party, led by heavy metal
vocalist Freddy Lim. Resistance to fascism requires not just political
speech, but a commitment to cultural production --- to the arts --- even
when it is demonized by the authoritarian government. The many Taiwanese
languages that predated the arrival of the KMT--Taiwanese Hokkien,
Hakka, and fifteen indigenous aboriginal languages (the "Formosan
languages")--are still spoken today, a testament to maintaining
independent ethnic identity in an illiberal society focused on
homogenization. Notably, political organizers and activists in Taiwan
use hip-hop as a political vehicle to express their anti-colonial
sentiments, rapping in Taiwanese Hokkien or singing in Hakka in order to
keep alive the stories of where their people have been. Artists like
Chang Jui-Chuan have used hip-hop to ensure that Taiwanese people never
forget what their fight for freedom is about. Even as white politicians
and respectability politics teach us that hip-hop is dangerous, hip-hop
is saving lives, not just here, but in Taiwan too. Our tools are that
effective, that powerful. Taiwan's success in wielding them reminds us
to see the strength in ourselves. More broadly, we are not alone in our
freedom fight. Decades after the 228 incident, grassroots activists have
changed the conversation in Taiwan. The arc of the moral universe is
long, but in Taiwan we see more evidence that it is possible to bend it
toward justice.

### Link -- Ukraine

#### In Russia's Ukrainian annexation, they tried to steal legitimacy from the US by exploiting dominant racial views.

Casey **Michel**, 9-26-20**17**, \"How Russia keeps exploiting
anti-black racism in the U.S.,\" No Publication,
https://thinkprogress.org/russias-sordid-history-of-exploiting-anti-black-racism-in-the-u-s-df3b83b4dd86/

On Tuesday, [the Washington Post confirmed what had previously been
assumed about [Russia's campaign of buying Facebook ads to tilt the
presidential election]{.mark}, and to [stir racial tensions in the
U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the Post summed, the [[Russian ads took aim
at U.S. racial divides]{.mark}, paralleling efforts from the Trump
campaign. [The efforts mirror prior attempts from foreign actors to
inflame racial divisions in the U.S]{.mark}. -- [the most notable of
which have come]{.mark}, perhaps unsurprisingly, [from Moscow]{.mark}.
Where many African-Americans, especially in the 1920s and 1930s, saw the
Soviet Union as a beacon of racial equality -- a role Kremlin higher-ups
willingly played up, despite Soviet collectivization leading to the
deaths of millions, especially among minority populations -- the
post-World War II period saw a rise in covert operations directed at
American racial divisions. "[Russia often looked to use anti-black
racism in the US as a way of]{.mark} [exposing what they believed was
the moral bankruptcy of Western capitalism and the hypocrisy of American
'democracy]{.mark},\'"]{.underline} said Jennifer Wilson, a postdoctoral
fellow in the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Slavic
Languages and Literature. ["[Russia has always seen the problem of
anti-black racism in the U.S. as a political tool]{.mark}."]{.underline}
The fight for fair elections is not dead For instance, as described in
Christopher Andrew's The Sword and the Shield, a detailed composition of
KGB operations compiled by a former KGB archivist, Soviet operations to
stoke racial tensions spiked in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1967, [Moscow
aimed at removing Martin Luther King, Jr., from his leadership role
within the broader civil rights movement]{.underline}. Per Andrew, [KGB
higher-ups approved a plan to "place articles in the African press,
which could then be reprinted in American newspapers, portraying King as
an 'Uncle Tom' who was secretly receiving government subsidies to tame
the civil rights movement and prevent it threatening the Johnson
administration."]{.underline} (Writes Andrew, [MLK "was probably the
only prominent American to be the target of active measures by both the
FBI and the KGB]{.underline}.") As War is Boring's Darien Cavanaugh
added, the campaign sought to replace King with Stokely Carmichael,
hoping a less pacifist leader would help spark a race war within the
U.S. [The drive also included, in a harbinger of the Facebook ads to
come, distributing fabricated pamphlets that showed far-right groups
bent on "developing a plan for the physical elimination of leading
figures in the Negro movement in the U.S." Growing bolder by the early
1970s, the KGB moved beyond innuendo into a far more violent strain of
its campaign. Moscow higher-ups -- including then-KGB chief Yuri
Andropov, who would eventually lead the Soviet Union in the early 1980s
-- signed off on pamphlets, to be sent to African-American militants,
which said that Jewish vigilante groups viewed them as "black mongrels."
Writes Cavanaugh, the pamphlets "were distributed to 30 black militant
groups in the New York area." Meanwhile, the KGB approved a plan to
release explosives in "the Negro section of New York," with one [KGB
official suggesting bombing "one of the Negro colleges" as a back-up
option]{.mark}. Following the planned bombing, [KGB agents would then
issue anonymous phone calls "to two or three black organizations,
claiming that the explosion was the work of the Jewish Defense
League."]{.mark} The planned bombing, thankfully, never went off, and
the KGB's operations to stoke a broader race war in the U.S. ultimately
failed.]{.underline} (A series of forged letters claiming to be from the
KKK, which said the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics would be "FOR THE WHITES
ONLY!" and which were sent to a number of Asian and African delegations,
also predictably fell flat.) [However, the campaigns, and the broader
notion that the U.S. could collapse in on itself along racial lines, set
a precedent we've seen play out over the past few years. To wit, during
the 2014 Ferguson protests, [Russian state media hyped the
racial]{.mark} [fracture on display]{.mark}. Wrote BuzzFeed's Max
Seddon, "America is gripped in the throes of a violent race war as
retribution for the bloody revolution it had plotted against Moscow's
allies in Ukraine, according to the pro-Kremlin press."]{.underline} One
RT article even predicted a possible American implosion in the aftermath
of Ferguson, with another headline from Russian outlet MK asking if
Ferguson could "become a second Donetsk." Other Russian media dubbed the
protests "AfroMaidan," in a nod to Ukraine's 2014 "EuroMaidan"
revolution, while Maria Katasonova, who has rapidly become one of the
faces of Russian nationalism (and Trump support within Russia), even
tried to get a hashtag that translates to "Black Russia" to trend. Much
like their Soviet-era precedent, [[Russian actors have continued
targeting both sides of the racial divide in the U.S., with black and
white nationalists alike recently constructing their own links with
those in Moscow]{.mark}. However, with the continuing revelations
regarding the Facebook ads, fake pages, and attempts at organizing
on-the-ground rallies throughout 2016, it's clear that Moscow's social
media campaign has far exceeded any prior attempt -- in reach and
success alike -- at inflaming U.S. race relations. Much like the Trump
campaign, and Trump presidency, these Facebook ads and pages,
paralleling KGB attempts decades ago, aimed directly at America's racial
fault lines -- all attempting to stoke the types of racial fracture the
U.S. hasn't seen in decades.]{.underline}

### Link -- Israel 

#### The call for Palestinian solidarity is parasitic anti-Blackness that would be incoherent without the libidinal investment in Black captivity. Their arc of redemption reifies Israeli civil society and locks Blacks into abject humanity.

American Studies & Drama at UC Irvine, "Afro-Pessimism and the End of
Redemption," *Humanities Futures-Franklin Humanities* Insitute, Duke

I. It is my conviction that [Black people embody]{.underline} (which is
different from saying are always willing or allowed to express) [a
meta-aporia for Humanist thought and action]{.underline}. In its
critique of social movements, Afro-Pessimism argues that [[Blacks do not
function as **political subjects**]{.mark}; instead, [our]{.mark} flesh
and [energies are instrumentalized for postcolonial]{.mark}, immigrant,
feminist, LGBT, and workers' [agendas]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[These]{.mark} so-called [allies are never authorized by Black agendas
predicated on Black ethical dilemmas]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[A Black
radical agenda is **terrifying**]{.mark} to most people on the Left
[because]{.mark} it emanates from a condition of suffering for which
[there is no imaginable strategy for redress---**no narrative of
redemption**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

I was living in Minneapolis, doing work around the First Palestinian
Intifada (1988--89). I was sitting on a grassy knoll trying to console
[a Palestinian friend]{.underline} of mine whose cousin had blown
himself up (accidentally) while making a bomb in the West Bank. My
friend was speaking openly and without his internal censors at work,
which was fine---he was grieving. At one point, he [said that it was
really shameful and humiliating the way Israeli men ran their hands over
your body when they stop you at a checkpoint]{.underline}. **[Then he
said that the deepest sense of humiliation was felt when the Israeli
soldier was an Ethiopian Jew]{.underline}**.

Needless to say, this tidbit of information gave me pause. I didn't know
what to make of this. I was pleased that he felt so comfortable with me
that he could speak openly and honestly, but I was also deeply hurt at
the thought that [[my place in the collective unconscious of Arabs was
the]{.mark} [same]{.mark} location of [general
dishonor]{.mark}]{.underline} (Patterson) [that I occupied in the
collective unconscious [of White Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}. I
gathered enough wits about me to inform him that [that was odd, seeing
as how the [Palestinians were at war with Israelis]{.mark}, and White
Israelis at that]{.underline}! **[How was it that [people who
stole]{.mark} his [land and slaughtered]{.mark} his relatives
[were]{.mark} somehow [less of a threat than]{.mark} the speaking
implements]{.underline}** ([[the Black Jews]{.underline}]{.mark}) [White
Israelis got to do their dirty work?]{.underline} What was it about
Blacks that made us so fungible (Hartman 1997) we could be tossed like
salad in the minds of oppressors and of the oppressed who were not
Black? I was faced with the realization that, [in the collective
unconscious, [the Palestinian insurgent has more in common with Israeli
state and civil society than]{.mark} s/he does with [Black
people]{.mark}]{.underline}. What they share is a largely unconscious
consensus that Blackness is a locus of abjection (Marriott 2000, 2007)
to be instrumentalized on a whim. [At one moment [Blackness is a
disfigured]{.mark} and disfiguring **[phobic phenomenon]{.mark}**; at
another moment Blackness is a **sentient implement [to be joyously
deployed for]{.mark} reasons and [agendas that have little to do with
Black liberation]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Marriott 2000). [[There I
sat]{.mark}, [yearning]{.mark}, in solidarity with my Palestinian
friend's yearning, [for the]{.mark} full [restoration of Palestinian
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}; mourning, in solidarity with my
friend's mourning, over the loss of his insurgent cousin;
[yearning]{.underline}, that is, [for the historical [and political
redemption]{.mark}]{.underline} of what I thought was [a violated
Commons to which we both belonged]{.underline}---when, all of a sudden,
[[my friend reached]{.mark} down [into the libidinal economy]{.mark} of
his subjective coherence and the coherence of his people [and slapped
me]{.mark} upside the head with a wet gym shoe: the startling
realization that not only was I barred, ab initio, from the denouement
of redemption, but that the borders of redemption are policed by Whites
and non-Whites alike.]{.underline}

I realize, now, that it's worse than that. I, as Black person (if
person, subject, being are terms we can use) am both barred from the
denouement of redemption and, simultaneously, needed if redemption is to
attain any form of coherence. Without the articulation of a common
negrophobogenesis, shared by both Israeli and Palestinian, the narrative
coherence of their bloody conflict would evaporate. My friend's, and his
country's women's and men's negrophobogenesis, is the bedrock, the
concrete slabs upon which any edifice of Human articulation (whether
love or war) is built.

[If the disciplines which comprise the Humanities are to rid themselves
of the parasitism that they heretofore have had in common with radical
and progressive movements on the Left, that is, if our disciplinary
labors are to face, rather than disavow, the discrepancy between Humans
who suffer through an \"economy of disposability\"]{.underline} (Sexton
2015) [and Blacks who suffer by way of \"social death\"]{.underline}
(Patterson 1982), [then we must come to grips with how the
**[redemption]{.mark}** of the subaltern]{.underline} (a narrative, for
example, of Palestinian plenitude, loss, and restoration) **[[is made
possible by the (re)instantiation of a regime of violence that bars
Black people from the imaginary of redemption]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
(How this affects Black daily life is explored in two videos:
\"Reparations...Now,\" https://vimeo.com/73991006, and \"Re-Imagining
the Black Body: Race, Memory, and the Excavation of Freedom Now,\"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFo-GNfyD9g.)

II\. Afro-Pessimism is premised on an iconoclastic claim: that
**[Blackness is coterminous with Slaveness]{.underline}**. [[Blackness
is social death]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is to say that [there was
never a prior meta-moment of plenitude]{.underline}, never a moment of
[equilibrium]{.underline}, **[never a moment of social
life]{.underline}**. [[Blackness, as a paradigmatic position]{.mark}
(rather than as an ensemble of identities, cultural practices, or
anthropological accoutrement), [cannot be disimbricated from
slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The narrative arc of the slave who is
Black]{.underline} (unlike Orlando Patterson's generic slave who may be
of any race) [is]{.underline} not an arc at all, but [a flat
line]{.underline}, what Hortense Spillers (2003) calls [\"historical
stillness\"]{.underline}: a flat line [that \"moves\" from
disequilibrium to a moment in the narrative of faux equilibrium, to
**disequilibrium** restored and/or **rearticulated**]{.underline}. To
put it differently, [the violence which both elaborates and saturates
Black \"life\" is totalizing, so much so as to make narrative
inaccessible to Blacks]{.underline}. **[This is not simply a problem for
Black people]{.underline}**. [It is a problem for]{.underline} the
organizational calculus (Spillers 2003) of the [Humanities]{.underline}
writ large. [Foundational to]{.underline} the labors of
[disciplines]{.underline} housed within [the Humanities is the belief
that all sentient beings can be emplotted as narrative entities, that
every sentient subject is imbued with historicity, and this belief is
subtended by the idea that all beings can be redeemed]{.underline}.
[**[Historicity and redemption]{.mark}** are inextricably
bound]{.underline}. [Both **[are inherently anti-Black]{.mark}** in that
[without the psychic]{.mark} and/or physical [presence of a sentient
being that is]{.mark} barred]{.underline}, ab initio, [from narrative
and]{.underline}, by extension, [[barred from
redemption]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[the arc of redemption would lack
any touchstones of cohesion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One would not be
able to know what a world devoid of redemption looks like. [There
would]{.underline}, in fact, [exist a persona who is adjacent to
redemption]{.underline}, that is, [a degraded humanity that struggles to
be re-redeemed]{.underline} ([i.e]{.underline}., LGBT people, Native
Americans, [[Palestinians]{.underline}]{.mark}). However, [redemption's
semiotics of [meaning would still be incoherent because adjacency is
supplemental to meaning]{.mark}; contradistinction is essential to
meaning and coherence]{.underline}---and for this, **[[redemption
requires]{.mark} not degraded humanity but [abject
inhumanity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Abject inhumanity stabilizes the
redemption of those who do not need it, just [as it mobilizes the
narrative project of those who strive to be
re-redeemed]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

At the heart of my argument is the assertion that [Black emplotment is a
catastrophe for narrative at a meta-level rather than a crisis or aporia
within a particular narrative]{.underline}. To put it differently,
[social death is aporetic with respect to narrative writ
large]{.underline} ([and]{.underline}, by extension, to
[redemption]{.underline}, writ large).

If social death is aporetic with respect to narrative, [this is a
function of both space and time]{.underline}, [or]{.underline}, more
precisely, **[their absence]{.underline}**. [Narrative time]{.underline}
is always historical (imbued with historicity): \"It [marks stasis and
change within a \[human\] paradigm]{.underline}, [\[but\] it does not
mark the time of the \[human\] paradigm, the time of time itself, the
time by which the slave's dramatic clock is set. [For the slave,
historical 'time' is not possible]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (Wilderson
2010, 339). [Social death bars the slave from access to narrative, at
the level of temporality; but it also does so at the level of
spatiality]{.underline}. The other element that constitutes narrative is
setting, or mise-en-scène, or for a larger conceptualization, we might
follow H. Porter Abbott (2008) and say \"story world.\" But [just as
there is no time for the slave, [there is also no place of the

[The violence of slavery is not precipitated as a result of any

[the dishonor embodied by the slave is not a function of an event,

### Link -- Gender K 

#### The violent dichotomies that dis-imbricate woman from man are only intelligible through a relation to atomized captive flesh which sustains the functionality of symbolic resonance. Though women can be signified as subjects in a temporary suspension through the imposition of patriarchy, the reduction of blackness to an ungendered object precludes the capacities for questioning and redemption.

[\"Ethnicity\"]{.underline} perceived as mythical time [enables
a]{.underline} writer to perform a [variety of conceptual
moves]{.underline} all at once. Under its hegemony, [the human body
becomes a defenseless target for rape and veneration, and the
body]{.underline}, in its material and abstract phase, [a resource for
metaphor.]{.underline} For example, Moynihan\'s \"tangle of pathology\"
provides the descriptive strategy for the work\'s fourth chapter, which
suggests that \"underachievement\" in black males of the lower classes
is primarily the fault of black females, who achieve out of all
proportion, both to their numbers in the community and to the
paradigmatic example before the nation: \"Ours is a society which
presumes male leadership in private and public affairs\.... A
subculture, such as that of the Negro American, in which this is not the
pattern, is placed at a distinct disadvantage\" \[75\]. Between charts
and diagrams, we are asked to consider the impact of qualitative measure
on the black male\'s performance on standardized examinations,
matriculation in schools of higher and professional training, etc. Even
though Moynihan sounds a critique on his own argument here, he quickly
withdraws from its possibilities, suggesting that black males should
reign because that is the way the majority culture carries things out:
\"It is clearly a disadvantage for a minority group to be operating
under one principle, while the great majority of the population . . . is
operating on another\" \[75\]. Those persons living according to the
perceived \"matriarchal\" pattern are, therefore, caught in a state of
social \"pathology.\" Even though Daughters have their own agenda with
reference to this order of Fathers 66 (imagining for the moment that
Moynihan\'s fiction-and others like it-does not represent an adequate
one and that there is, once we dis-cover him, a Father here), [my
contention that these social and cultural subjects]{.underline} make
doubles, unstable in their respective identities, in effect
[**transports us to a common historical ground, the socio-political
order of the New World.** That order, with its human sequence written in
blood, represents for its African and indigenous peoples a scene of
actual mutilation, dismemberment, and exile]{.underline}. First of all,
[their New-World, diasporic plight marked a theft of the body-a willful
and violent]{.underline} (and unimaginable from this distance) [severing
of the captive body from its motive will, its active
desire.]{.underline} Under these conditions, **[[we lose at least gender
difference in the outcome]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and **[[the female
body and the male body become a territory of cultural and]{.mark}
[political maneuver]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[not]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[at all gender-related,
gender-specific]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But this body, at least from the
point of view of the captive community, focuses a private and particular
space, at which point of convergence biological, sexual, social,
cultural, linguistic, ritualistic, and psychological fortunes join. This
profound [intimacy of interlocking [detail is
disrupted]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[by externally imposed
meanings]{.underline}]{.mark} and uses: [[1) the]{.mark} [captive body
becomes]{.mark} the source of an [irresistible]{.mark}, destructive
sensuality; [2)]{.mark} at the same time-in stunning contradiction -
[the captive body reduces to a]{.mark} [thing]{.mark}, becoming being
for the captor; [3)]{.mark} in this absence from a subject position,
[the captured sexualities provide a physical and biological
expression]{.mark} [of]{.mark} \"[otherness]{.mark}\"; [4)]{.mark} as a
category of \"otherness,\" [the captive body translates into a potential
for pornotroping]{.mark} and embodies sheer physical powerlessness that
slides into a more general \"powerlessness,\" resonating through various
centers of human and social meaning.]{.underline} But I [would make a
[distinction]{.mark}]{.underline} in this case [**[between \"body\" and
\"flesh\"]{.underline}**]{.mark} and impose that distinction as the
central one **[between captive and liberated
subject-positions]{.underline}**. In that sense, [before the \"body\"
there is the \"flesh,\"]{.underline} that [zero degree of social
conceptualization that does not escape concealment under the brush of
discourse, or the reflexes of iconography]{.underline}. Even though the
European hegemonies stole bodies- some of them female-out of West
African communities in concert with the African \"middleman,\" we regard
this human and social irreparability as high crimes against the flesh,
as the person of African females and African males registered the
wounding. If we think of [the \"flesh\" as a primary narrative, then we
mean its seared, divided, ripped-apartness]{.underline}, riveted to the
ship\'s hole, fallen, or \"escaped\" overboard. One of the most poignant
aspects of William Goodell\'s contemporaneous study of the North
American slave codes gives precise expression to the tortures and
instruments of captivity. Reporting an instance of Jonathan Edwards\'s
observations on the tortures of enslavement, Goodell narrates: \"The
smack of the whip is all day long in the ears of those who are on the
plantation, or in the vicinity; and it is used with such dexterity and
severity as not only to lacerate the skin, but to tear out small
portions of the flesh at almost every stake\" \[221\]. The anatomical
specifications of rupture, of altered human tissue, take on the
objective description of laboratory prose-eyes beaten out, arms, backs,
skulls branded, a left jaw, a right ankle, punctured; teeth missing, as
the calculated work of iron, whips, chains, knives, the canine patrol,
the bullet. These [undecipherable markings on the captive body render a
kind of hieroglyphics of the flesh whose severe disjunctures come to be
hidden to the cultural seeing by skin color.]{.underline} We might well
ask if this [phenomenon of marking and branding]{.underline} actually
[\"transfers\" from one generation to another]{.underline}, finding its
various symbolic substitutions in an efficacy of meanings that repeat
the initiating moments? As Elaine Scarry describes the mechanisms of
torture \[Scarry 27-59\], these lacerations, woundings, fissures, tears,
scars, openings, ruptures, lesions, rendings, punctures of the flesh
create the distance between what I would designate a cultural
vestibularity and the culture, whose state apparatus, including judges,
attorneys, \"owners,\" \"soul drivers,\" \"overseers,\" and \"men of
God,\" apparently colludes with a protocol of \"search and destroy.\"
[[This body whose flesh carries the female and the male to the frontiers
of survival bears in person the marks of a cultural text whose inside
has been turned outside]{.mark}.]{.underline} The flesh is the
concentration of \"ethnicity\" that contemporary critical discourses
neither acknowledge nor discourse away. It is this \"flesh and blood\"
entity, in the vestibule (or \"pre-view\") of a colonized North America,
that is essentially ejected from \"The Female Body in Western Culture\"
\[see Suleiman, ed.\], but it makes good theory, or commemorative
diacritics / summer 1987 67 \"herstory\" to want to \"forget,\" or to
have failed to realize, that the African female subject, under these
historic conditions, is not only the target of rape- in one sense, an
interiorized violation of body and mind- but also the topic of
specifically externalized acts of torture and prostration that we
imagine as the peculiar province of male brutality and torture inflicted
by other males. A female body strung from a tree limb, or bleeding from
the breast on any given day of field work because the \"overseer,\"
standing the length of a whip, has popped her flesh open, adds a lexical
and living dimension to the narratives of women in culture and society
\[Davis 9\]. This materialized scene of [unprotected]{.underline} female
[flesh]{.underline} - of female flesh \"ungendered\"- **[offers a praxis
and a theory, a text for living and for dying, and a method for reading
both through their diverse mediations.]{.underline}** Among the myriad
uses to which the enslaved community was put, Goodell identifies its
value for medical research: \"Assortments of diseased, damaged, and
disabled Negroes, deemed incurable and otherwise worthless are bought
up, it seems \... by medical institutions, to be experimented and
operated upon, for purposes of \'medical education\' and the interest of
medical science\" \[86-87; Goodell\'s emphasis\]. From the Charleston
Mercury for October 12, 1838, Goodell notes this advertisement: \'To
planters and others. - Wanted, fifty Negroes, any person, having sick
Negroes, considered incurable by their respective physicians, and
wishing to dispose of them, Dr. S. will pay cash for Negroes affected
with scrofula, or king\'s evil, confirmed hypochondriasm, apoplexy,
diseases of the liver, kidneys, spleen, stomach and intestines, bladder
and its appendages, diarrhea, dysentery, etc. The highest cash price
will be paid, on application as above.\' at No. 110 Church Street,
Charleston. \[87; Goodell\'s emphasis\] This [profitable \"atomizing\"
of the captive body provides another angle on the divided flesh: we lose
any hint or suggestion of a dimension of ethics, of relatedness between
human personality and its anatomical features, between one human
personality and another, between human personality and cultural
institutions.]{.underline} To that extent, the procedures adopted for
the **[[captive flesh demarcate a total
objectification]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as the entire captive community
becomes a living laboratory. [[The]{.mark} [captive]{.mark}
[body]{.mark}]{.underline}, then, [[brings into focus a gathering of
social realitie]{.mark}s as well as a [metaphor for value so thoroughly
interwoven in their literal and figurative emphases]{.mark} that
distinctions between them are virtually useless]{.underline}. Even
though the captive flesh/body has been \"liberated,\" and no one need
pretend that even the quotation marks do not matter, dominant symbolic
activity, the ruling episteme that releases the dynamics of [naming and
valuation, remains grounded in the originating metaphors of captivity
and mutilation]{.underline} so that it is as if neither time nor
history, nor historiography and its topics, shows movement, as [the
human subject is \"murdered\" over and over again by the passions of a
bloodless and anonymous archaism, showing itself in endless
disguise]{.underline}. Faulkner\'s young Chick Mallison in The Mansion
calls \"it\" by other names-\"the ancient subterrene atavistic fear..
.\" \[227\]. And I would call it the Great Long National Shame. But
people do not talk like that anymore- it is \"embarrassing,\" just as
the retrieval of mutilated female bodies will likely be \"backward\" for
some people. Neither the shameface of the embarrassed, nor the
not-looking-back of the self-assured is of much interest to us, and will
not help at all if rigor is our dream. We might concede, at the very
least, that sticks and bricks might break our bones, but words will most
certainly kill us. The symbolic order that I wish to trace in this
writing, calling it an \"American grammar,\" begins at the
\"beginning,\" which is really a rupture and a radically different kind
of cultural continuation. The massive demographic shifts, the violent
formation of a modern African consciousness, that take place on the
subsaharan Continent during the initiative strikes which open the
Atlantic Slave Trade in the fifteenth century of our Christ, interrupted
hundreds of years of black African culture. We write and think, then,
about an outcome of aspects of African-American life in the United
States under the pressure of those events. I might as well add that the
familiarity of this narrative does nothing to appease the hunger of
recorded memory, nor does the persistence of the repeated rob these
well-known, oft-told 68 events of their power, even now, to startle. In
a very real sense, every writing as revision makes the \"discovery\" all
over again.

#### The concept of gender in this modernity is a product of European epistemology and does not apply to black bodies or the black social condition 

**Broek 2008** (Sabine;Professor of black diasporic and gender studies @
The U of Bremem "University of Bremen, Germany, Gender Forum, Issue 22
(2008)

(White) Gender Studies may decide to reflect self-critically on its own
embeddedness in the Enlightenment proposal of human freedom which
strategically split a certain group of humans, namely enslaved
African-origin people, from the constitutive freedom to possess
themselves and as such, from any access to subjectivity, which entailed,
as Hortense Spillers above all has argued, a splitting of African-origin
women from gender. If, thus, the knowledge of the slave trade and
slavery will become the site of a rereading of Enlightenment, modernity
and postmodernity, a revised theoretical, and material approach to an
epistemology of emancipation like Gender Studies will be possible[[.
Gender Studies]{.mark}**, too,** [lives \"in the time of
slavery]{.mark}**,\" in the \"future created by it\"**]{.underline}
(Hartman 2007, 133). [[It is the economic, cultural and epistemic regime
of human commodification, that transgressive nexus of violence, desire
and property which first formed the horizon of]{.mark} **the
Euro-American** [modernity that US a]{.mark}]{.underline}[nd]{.mark}
European [[intellectuals]{.underline}]{.mark}, including Gender Studies,
have known and claimed. The Enlightenment\'s **[proposal of human
subjectivity and rights which was in fact inscribed into the world the
slave trade and slavery had made]{.underline}** (Blackburn), **[created
a vertical structure of access claims to self-representation and social
participation from which African-origin people, as hereditary
commodities, were a priori abjected]{.underline}**. [[It is on the basis
of]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[abjection, that the category of woman, of
gender as a framework]{.mark} to negotiate the social, cultural and
economic [position of white European women was created.]{.mark} To
accept that the very constitution of gender as a term in European early
modernity was tied to a social, cultural and political system which
constitutively pre-figured \"wasted lives,\"]{.underline} and an extreme
precariousness of [[what constitutes human existence, throws
contemporary notions of gendered subjectivity into stark
relief]{.mark}**. Hartman\'s work, therefore, may be read
as**]{.underline} just as **[axiomatic]{.underline}** as Bauman\'s,
Butler\'s or Agamben\'s in measuring postmodern global challenges to
critical theory. Elaine Scary\'s, Susan Sontag\'s interventions on pain
and voyeurism, and Spillers\' or Wood\'s considerations, more
specifically, on the sexualized campaigns of Anglo-American abolition,
have compounded the challenge for an epistemology of slavery as a modern
episteme not to recycle abolitionist titillation - the risk to become
part of a second order abolitionist discourse must, however, be run**[.
To play an active role in the project of decolonizing]{.underline}**
(post) modern [**critical theory,** [gender studies need to acknowledge
and reckon]{.mark} with [black de-colonial feminist]{.mark}
interventions beyond add-on approaches. Those interventions will enable
an epistemic turn away from the solipsistic quasi universal presentism
of much of contemporary theory, and make it answerable to its own
indebtedness to the history of early modern Europe, and the New
World**.**]{.underline} Hartman\'s and Spiller\'s texts, as well as
Morrison\'s writing become something [[like deconstructive guides: we
are being asked to look, and listen with black women\'s perspectives -
but at the same time the texts fold back on themselves, and thus on our
reading; they disrupt a smooth appropriation of suffering, they derail
us from a swift hate]{.mark}]{.underline} for the Thistlewoods (Mother,
61). Those texts under scrutiny here do enact a kind of self-conscious
parasitism, forcing readers into complicity - but they refuse to do it
innocently, disrupting a renewed take on slavery by way of abolitionist
benevolence. They teach readers that the boundaries of the archive
cannot be trespassed at will, and without consequence; and they also
teach us to respect what Hartman calls, with Fred Moten, \"black noise\"
(2008, 12).

## Impact 

### Impact -- Ontology 

**Blackness is ontological -- it is the thing that is able to graft
coherence to other reference points by being in antagonism to it**

[[After]{.mark} the "nonevent of [emancipation]{.mark},"]{.underline}[4
[slavery did not]{.underline} ]{.mark}[simply [give way to
freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, the [legal disavowal of ownership
reorganized domination and [the former slave became the]{.mark}
[racialized Black "subject," whose position was marked
epidermally]{.mark},]{.underline} per Frantz Fanon.5 What followed was a
profound entrenchment of the concept of race, both psychically and
juridically. Formally, [the Black subject was no longer a slave,
but]{.underline} introduction 9 [the same formative relation of
structural violence that maintained slavery
remained]{.underline}---upheld explicitly by the police (former slave
catchers) and white supremacy generally---hence [[preserving the
equation that Black equals socially dead]{.underline}]{.mark}. Just as
wanton violence was a constituent element of slavery, so it is to
Blackness. [[Given the ongoing accumulation of Black death at the hands
of the police]{.mark}---even [despite increased visibility]{.mark} in
recent years---it becomes apparent that a Black person on the street
today faces open vulnerability to violence just as the slave did on the
plantation]{.underline}. That [there has recently been such an increase
in media coverage and yet little decrease in murder [reveals the ease
with which anti-Black violence can be ignored]{.mark} by white society;
[at the same time]{.mark} this [reveals that when one is Black one
needn't do anything to be targeted]{.mark}, as [Blackness itself is
criminalized]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With this understanding of slavery
and Blackness, Afro-pessimism makes a critical shift in focus by moving
away from the Black/ white binary and reframing it as
Black/non-Black]{.underline}, in order [to deemphasize the status of
whiteness and to center analysis]{.underline}, rather, [on the
anti-Black foundations of race and modern society]{.underline}. In other
words, "[it is racial blackness as a necessary condition for enslavement
that matters most, rather than whiteness as a sufficient condition for
freedom]{.underline}."6 As a result, it is Blackness, and more speci
cally [[anti-Blackness]{.underline}]{.mark}, that [[gives coherence to
categories of non-Black]{.mark}---white, worker, gay, i.e., "human."
[Categories of non-Black must establish their boundaries for inclusion
in a group (humanity) by having a recognizable self
within]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [There must]{.underline} also,
consequently, [be an outside to each group,]{.underline} and, as with
the concept of humanity, [[it is Blackness that is without;]{.mark} it
is Blackness that is the dark matter surrounding and holding together
the categories of non-Black.]{.underline} Experientially, subjects, even
Black ones, can obviously find themselves with any myriad identities,
but [[ontologically Blackness is still violently excluded from even the
meager scraps given when recognized]{.mark}.]{.underline}

between powerful unconscious urges and the social/cultural need to keep
these urges outside of the conscious mind.]{.underline}** [**[The
'neurosis of blackness']{.underline}**]{.mark} **[Fanon has in mind is
exactly]{.underline}** [**[the 'dream of turning
white']{.underline}**]{.mark} (that is, the wish to attain the level of
humanity accorded to whites in racist/colonial contexts) as it comes
into conflict with one's being in a black body, and within a racist
society, which make this wish impossible. Importantly, **[rather than
framed within the limits of individual psychology, as was Freud's
intention with the concept of neurosis, Fanon's use of the idea of
neurosis makes of it an explicitly social psychological phenomenon,
rooted in the specific historical and political contexts of
colonisation]{.underline}**. Infantile [**[trauma]{.underline}**]{.mark}
If we are looking for the cause of neurotic disturbances, says Freud
(and hence, a means to cure them), one must always look to the childhood
history of the individual. The symptoms of neurosis are always linked to
a kind of psychical trauma, which lends them their individual character.
More than this, **[[we are not always looking for a single
event]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[for [the cause]{.mark} of the symptom
most often arises out of '[multiple traumas]{.mark}, [frequently
analogous and repeated']{.mark} (Freud, cited in Fanon, 1986, 144). Such
traumas are expelled from the conscious mind as means of saving the
neurotic from great suffering. More importantly, this trauma need not
have happened 'in the real'. [It need not have been an actual
event]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} may just as well have been
[fantasised]{.mark}. Importantly, this is the conceptual leap which
means [psychoanalysis can focus its]{.mark} curative [efforts]{.mark}
almost completely on elements [of fantasy rather than]{.mark} on
elements of [reality]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Hence, [**[the neurosis of
the black man or woman]{.underline}** **[need not then have stemmed from
actual experiences]{.underline}**]{.mark} (the witnessing of the
lynching of one's father is the example Fanon gives (1986)), but rather
from fantasised experiences or, more to the point, **[[from indirect or
cultural forms of oppression or trauma]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Then
again, one might argue, it would seem that real examples of traumatic
racist violence or abuse would seem quite commonplace in the colonial
environment. **[As a result, one often gets the sense of Fanon
formulating a new critical language where one had not previously
existed, of Fanon generating a new -- even if hybrid -- set of concepts
with which to critique relations of power in racist and colonial
environments]{.underline}**. Like Feminism and Marxism, post-colonial
critique ultimately **[aims to do just this, to formulate a unique
register through which forms of discrimination and disempowerment that
would have otherwise remained effectively invisible, indiscernible,
'naturalised' within a society, come to be brought into sharp
relief]{.underline}**. One should note here that **[[Fanon had an
extremely ambivalent relationship with]{.mark} psychology and
[psychoanalysis]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[that he was extremely aware
that both disciplines transmit, reinscribe or reify certain
ideologically loaded Eurocentric notions that work to serve one dominant
(oppressive, racist, colonial) socialpolitical grouping over
another.]{.underline}** (I am speaking here of the power exercised by
racial, ethnic, gender and sexual majorities over minorities). **[In
other words, [Fanon is aware of the strategic value of deploying
certain]{.mark} psychological and [psychoanalytic terms]{.mark} in his
analysis -- and does so to great political effect -- [without becoming
too reliant on them]{.mark}. Indeed, [he compounds his]{.mark}
psychological and [psychoanalytic terms of analysis with so many other
forms of criticism that his critique never becomes dependent on
psychological terms alone]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Neurosis and cultural
trauma If not necessarily real events -- or necessarily physically real
events -- then what are the traumatising causes of neurosis? How can it
be that black people who may not even have had direct contact with
whites may still develop 'neuroses of race'? **[Here Fanon differs
somewhat from Freud, as touched on above. While he agrees with Freud
that the basis of neurosis must be that of some or other kind of
infantile trauma, he will suggest that this original trauma can be
shared and cultural rather than simply intrapsychic and
individualisticin nature.]{.underline}** The colonial environment,
argues Fanon, is unlike any other. It is so characterised by racism, by
violence and oppression, that these material and cultural forms of
trauma may, as opposed to the internal fantasised bases posited by
Freud, act as the causes of neurosis. **[In short, then, the basis of
the racial neurosis of the black subject lies, for Fanon, in the
infantile trauma caused by the black child's exposure to the racist
values of the oppressive colonial environment]{.underline}**.

### Impact -- Objective Vertigo

#### **There is nothing to reconcile between anti-black violence and other violences -- although subaltern subjects may be alienated, they themselves are disoriented within civil society, whereas anti-black violence constitutes the world itself.**

**Wilderson '11** (Frank B. Wilderson III is an Associate Professor of
African-American Studies at UC Irvine and has a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley.
"The Vengeance of Vertigo: Aphasia and Abjection in the Political Trials
of Black Insurgents", InTensions Journal Issue 5) /NoWa

**[[With only small arms]{.mark} and crude explosives [at their
disposal]{.mark}, with little of nothing in the way of logistical
support, [with no liberated zone to claim or
reclaim]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and with no more than a vague knowledge
that there were a few hundred other insurgents scattered throughout the
U.S. operating in largely uncoordinated and decentralized units[[,**the
BLA launched 66 operations against the largest police state in the
world. Vertigo must have seized them each time they clashed with agents
of a nuclear-weapons regime**]{.mark}]{.underline} with three million
troops in uniform[, **a regime that could put 150,000 new police on the
streets in any given year, and [whose]{.mark} ordinary [White citizens
frequently deputize themselves in the name of law]{.mark} and order.
[Subjective vertigo]{.mark}, no doubt: [a dizzying sense that one
is]{.mark} moving or [spinning in a]{.mark}n otherwise [stationary
world]{.mark}, a vertigo [brought on by a clash of]{.mark} grossly
[asymmetrical forces]{.mark}.**]{.underline} There are suitable
analogies, for this kind of vertigo must have also seized Native
Americans who launched the AIM's occupation of Wounded Knee, and FALN
insurgents who battled the FBI. [**Subjective vertigo is [vertigo of the
event]{.mark}. But [the sensation]{.mark} that one is not simply
spinning in an otherwise stable environment, [that one's environment is
perpetually unhinged stems from a relationship to violence that cannot
be analogized]{.mark}. This is [called objective vertigo, a life
constituted by disorientation]{.mark} rather than a life interrupted by
disorientation. [This is structural as opposed to performative]{.mark}
violence.**]{.underline} Black subjectivity is a crossroads where
vertigoes meet, the intersection of performative and structural
violence. Elsewhere I have argued that the Black is a sentient being
though not a Human being. The Black's and the Human's disparate
relationship to violence is at the heart of this failure of
incorporation and analogy. The Human suffers contingent violence,
violence that kicks in when s/he resists (or is perceived to resist) the
disciplinary discourse of capital and/or Oedipus. But Black peoples'
subsumption by violence is a paradigmatic necessity, not just a
performative contingency. **[[To be constituted]{.mark} by [and
disciplined by violence]{.mark}, to be gripped simultaneously by
subjective and objective vertigo, [is indicative of a political ontology
which is radically different from the]{.mark} political ontology of a
[sentient being who is]{.mark} constituted by discourse and [disciplined
by violence when s/he breaks]{.mark} with the ruling discursive
[codes.]{.mark}]{.underline}** When we begin to assess revolutionary
armed struggle in this comparative context, we find that Human
revolutionaries (workers, women, gays and lesbians, post-colonial
subjects) suffer subjective vertigo when they meet the state's
disciplinary violence with the revolutionary violence of the subaltern;
but they are spared objective vertigo. This is because **[the most
disorienting aspects of their lives are induced by the struggles that
arise from intra-Human conflicts over competing conceptual frameworks
and disputed cognitive maps]{.underline}**, such as the American Indian
Movement's demand for the return of Turtle Island vs. the U.S.'s desire
to maintain territorial integrity, or the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación
Nacional's (FALN) demand for Puerto Rican independence vs. the U.S.'s
desire to maintain Puerto Rico as a territory. But **[for the Black, as
[for the slave, there are no cognitive maps, no conceptual frameworks of
suffering]{.mark} and dispossession [which are analogic with]{.mark} the
myriad [maps and frameworks which explain the dispossession of]{.mark}
Human [subalterns.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### AT: Blackness not Ontological

#### The 1ac participates into the ruse of analogy which foregoes the particularities of violence that is blackness and subsequently lacks the theoretical framework to account for the structural position of blackness because they mediate on the politics of culture. This also disproves their blackness is contingent argument because that framing 1.) Focus on violence rationally which frame black violence as a punishing response instead of structurally locked in and 2.) sees violence rationally instead of a libidinal desire to obliterate blackness

III." Black Studies Papers 2.1 (2016): 4--6 DTY)

For me, [Black Studies is a discipline that seeks to offer the best
his-torical and theoretical framework for questions confronting the
Black di-aspora.]{.underline} Even though it started in the United
States, I consider this to before all continents. [There's a way in
which Black Studies is the unacknowledged center of the Humanities and
the Social Sciences. Because Black Studies is the place where one
must]{.underline}, whether one wants to or not, [con-front and
interrogate the]{.underline} un- and/or under-interrogated assumptions
on which the Humanities rest[: that all sentient beings are subjects;
that empa-thy can be extended to all sentient beings; that all sentient
beings are pre-carious in the same way, structurally (as, for example,
exploited and al-ienated subjects of capital, sexism, homophobia and/or
settler domina-tion).]{.underline} Black Studies confronts disciplines
of the Humanities and the social sciences with a question regarding the
universal applicability of those ra-ther basic 'truth' claims. So,
perhaps the most besetting hobble of the disciplines that fall under the
banner of the Humanities and Social Sciences is the lack of a robust
comparative lens. [Here in the United States, most of the other
disciplines have]{.underline} what I would call [an inadequate
comparative lens.]{.underline} And by inade-quate comparative lens I
mean that there is a way in [which,]{.underline} say, tradition-al
Ethnic Studies in the United States [tends to [lump Black people]{.mark}
[with other people of color as well as with the white working class and
Native Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example. And one of the
reasons why this [happens is be-cause, traditionally speaking, for
something like Ethnic Studies, you have a situation in which capitalism,
rather than [the machinations of libidinal economy, is]{.mark}
all-essential to their critique,]{.underline} and I think [there is [a
problem with capital being central to the critique of
oppression]{.mark}, especially [with respect to Black people]{.mark}.
And I think this centrality of [capitalism blinds these]{.mark} other
disciplines to [the ways in which Black people's suffering can-not be
analogized with anyone else's]{.mark}---which is not to say that
capitalism is not a global problem]{.underline}---I'll have more to say
about that later. So what I think is Black Studies really should be
aiming to explain the condition of suffering for Black people without
being hobbled by the ruse of analogy. I don't want to prescribe the
"primary tasks and aims" of Black Studies, so much as I want to point
out two problems that need to be---and are be-ing---addressed as Black
Studies moves forward in the 21^st^ century. The first one we've just
been discussing; and, in Red, White, & Black I call that "the ruse of
analogy" (35). [The problem with developing a Black Studies which does
not radically differentiate between Blacks and all others, is that one
theorizes the structural violence that subsumes [Black people as being
homologous with the structural violence that subjugates Native
Ameri-cans, the working class or post-colonials]{.mark}. [This
leads]{.mark} one down a blind al-ley in which one forgets, or [fails to
understand]{.mark}, [how the violence of settler occupation or labor
subsumption has a utility that anti-Black violence does not
have]{.mark}. One begins to think rationally about violence. And then
violence appears as a punishing response, contingent upon a Black
per-son's transgression of codes, mores, laws, or policies etc. That's
not how or why the violence of social death operates. Black Studies is a
field which recalibrates our understanding of anti-Black violence and,
in so doing, makes the Humanities more rigorous and gives the
disciplines of the Humanities greater explanatory power.]{.underline}
The second problem is related to the first but it is an effect of the
con-servative hydraulics that has pressed against all forms of
revolutionary thought and action since the late 1970s, if not before.
Amanda Lashaw called this problem the difference between a politics of
culture and a cul-ture of politics (when I knew her in grad school at UC
Berkeley---and I borrowed her idea). Right now---really, since the
1980s---scholarship has been more invested in a politics of culture than
in a culture of politics. [This has meant that the Humanities and the
Social Sciences have become more interested in exploring the
preconscious interests of subjects in vari-ous social formations than in
the structural positionality of those subjects]{.underline}.
Preconscious interest is all about how someone speaks about or performs
their cultural or gender oriented identity. [Invariably the scholarship
is tainted by a desire to access civil society and/or expand its
parameters that it might be inclusive of marginalized identities. This
is not the kind of scholarship that can be harnessed as a kind of
explanatory accompani-ment for revolutionary activity; even though the
hubris of the scholarship often presents itself (if only to itself) as
earth shattering. It's not]{.underline}. Believe me, it's not. Black
Studies, on the other hand, was born in flames. Just look at what it
took to get it at Cornell University and San Francisco State. Just look
at how under siege Black Studies programs and departments are all over
the United States. Black Studies was, in its early iterations (and in
its most dynamic iterations today) never unconcerned with the cultural
contributions of Black people across the diaspora, but, and this is key,
[Black Studies at its best explores and explains how and why the
cultural offerings of Black people can never be recognized and
incorporated as cultural offerings coming from a people. Those offerings
invariably trans-posed in the collective unconscious of civil society as
being, a priori, extensions of the master's prerogative]{.underline}(to
paraphrase Hartman)

#### Blackness via slavery becomes the moniker for an individual already void of relationality which exceeds just an experience of human of bondage but a condition of ontology 

**Wilderson III 07**- (Frank B. Wilderson, Assistant professor of
African American Studies and Drama at UC Irvine, Red, White, & Black:
Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms pg 27-28, DTY)

[During the emergence of new ontological relations in the modern
world,]{.underline} from the late Middle Ages through the 1500s[, many
different kinds of people experienced slavery]{.underline}. In other
words, there have been times when natal alienation, general dishonor,
and gratuitous violence have turned individuals of myriad ethnicities
and races into beings who are socially dead. [But the African, or more
precisely [Blackness]{.mark}, [is the moniker for an individual who is
by definition always already void of relationality]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Thus, modernity marks the emergence of a new ontology because it is an
era in which an entire race of people who, a priori, that is prior to
the contingency of the "transgressive act" (such as losing at war or
being convicted of a crime), stand as socially dead in relation to the
rest of the world. This, I will argue, is as true for those who were
herded onto the slave ships as it is for those who had no knowledge
whatsoever of the coffles. In this period, chattel slavery, as [[a
condition of ontology]{.mark} and not just as an event of experience,
[stuck to the African]{.mark} [like Velcro]{.mark}. To the extent that
we can think the essence of Whiteness and the essence of Blackness, we
must think [their essences through the structure of the Master/Slave
relation]{.mark}]{.underline}. It should be clear by now that I am not
only drawing a distinction between what is commonly thought of as the
Master/Slave relation and the constituent elements of the Master/Slave
relation (Patterson 6), but I am also drawing a distinction between the
experience of slavery (which anyone can be subjected to) and the
ontology of slavery, which in Modernity (the years 1300 to the present)
becomes the singular purview of the Black. In this period, slavery is
cathedralized. It "advances" from a word which describes a condition
that anyone can be subjected to, to [a word which reconfigures the
African body into Black flesh. Far from being merely the experience of
the African, slavery is now the African's access to]{.underline} (or,
more correctly, banishment from[) ontology]{.underline}.

### AT: Libidinal Economy wrong

#### Concepts like social death, libidinal economy, and ontology are a [good analytical frame]{.underline} even if they aren't capital T truth. 

**Brady 2015** (Nick Brady, PhD candidate at UC Irvine, **"**A Few Notes
on the Intramural of Afropessimism",
<https://outofnowhereblog.wordpress.com/2015/07/31/a-few-notes-to-the-intramural-on-afropessimism/>)

I once was told in a conversation, "I just don't buy that black people
are socially dead." In another situation, a friend of mine was asked a
similar question centered about belief. [The bottom line seems to come
down to [whether or not you "buy" that social death]{.mark} is real,
whether it [has capital "T" truth]{.mark} behind it. Is the sky is blue?
Can black people be socially dead?]{.underline} In certain people's
attitudes social death seems to have the intellectual weight of Dragons
and Unicorns. Somewhere behind these conversations Jay Z raps "We don't
believe you, you need more people." Such engagement, while
understandable at a certain level, can be put in the same intellectual
trash bin as "I'm black and I have seen reverse racism" or "Work is not
exploitative, I like my work." All can be true at the level of one's
perception, while one's personal feelings do not necessarily translate
into an accurate or even desirable political analysis. [Theories of
social death, political ontology, and libidinal economy are concepts
produced in a political analysis of many different fields]{.underline},
such as race and psychoanalysis, the forever growing historical
literature on slavery and capitalism, the black radical tradition, black
feminist and black queer interventions into theory and politics, etc.
This is to say, [it is making an argument and one must engage the actual
substance of the argument]{.underline}. As a writer, I employ concepts
such as social death, political ontology, and libidinal economy as
critical terms of study. [These concepts [enable]{.mark} me to do both
political and intellectual [work that speaks]{.mark} directly
[to]{.mark} the pervasive nature of [black suffering across time and
space.]{.mark} They are not the only concepts nor are they original, the
novelty lies in how the concept allows certain work to be done. So [when
one says thinking of race as ontology destroys our agency and destroys
the possibility of possibility itself, locking us into a self-defeating
logic,]{.mark} I always wonder what they mean. Do they mean the theory
of social death or political ontology has a material history that has
locked us out of possibility? The obvious answer to this is, [the theory
did not do that, the world did that and the theory describes the
violence of the world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT: Nuclear war Outweighs

**The world has already ended for people of color, the aff's rhetoric of
nuclear war/extinction prioritizes hypothetical impact scenarios while
ignoring ongoing structural violence -- reject that Framework**

In April, 1979, **[the [U.S. Arms Control]{.mark} and Disarmament Agency
[released a report on the effects of nuclear war that concludes]{.mark}
that, [in a]{.mark} general [nuclear war]{.mark} between the United
States and the Soviet Union, [25 to 100 million people would be
killed]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[This is]{.underline}**]{.mark}
approximately **[[the same number of African people who
died]{.underline}]{.mark}** between 1492 and 1890 **[[as a result of the
African slave trade]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the New World.
**[The]{.underline}** same federal **[report]{.underline}** also
**[comments on the destruction of urban housing that would cause massive
shortages after a nuclear war]{.underline}**, as well as on the crops
that would be lost, causing massive food shortages. Of course, **[[for
people of color the world over, starvation is already a common
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}**, when, for example, a nation's crops are
grown for export rather than to feed its own people. And **[the
[housing]{.mark} of people of color throughout the world's urban areas
[is already]{.mark} blighted and [inhumane]{.mark}:]{.underline}**
families live in shacks, shanty towns, or on the streets; even in the
urban areas of North America, the poor may live without heat or running
water. **[For people of color, [the world as we knew it ended centuries
ago]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Our world, with its own languages, customs
and ways, ended. And **[we are only now beginning to see with increasing
clarity that our task is to reclaim that world, struggle for it, and
rebuild it in our own image]{.underline}**. **[[The "death culture" we
live in has convinced many to be more concerned with death than with
life]{.mark},]{.underline}** more willing to demonstrate for "survival
at any cost" than to struggle for liberty and peace with dignity.
**[[Nuclear disarmament becomes a safe issue when it is not linked
to]{.mark} the [daily]{.mark} and historic [issues of racism]{.mark}, to
the [ways in which people of color continue to be
murdered]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Acts of war, [nuclear
holocausts]{.mark}, and genocide [have already been declared on
our]{.mark} jobs, our housing, our schools, our families, and [our
lands]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As women of color, we are warriors, not
pacifists. **[We must fight as a people on all fronts]{.underline}**, or
we will continue to die as a people. We have fought in people's wars in
China, in Cuba, in Guinea-Bissau, and in such struggles as the civil
rights movement, the women's movement, and in countless daily encounters
with landlords, welfare departments, and schools. These struggles are
not abstractions, but the only means by which we have gained the ability
to eat and to provide for the future of our people. We wonder who will
lead the battle for nuclear disarmament with the vigor and clarity that
women of color have learned from participating in other struggles. Who
will make the political links among racism, sexism, imperialism,
cultural integrity, and nuclear arsenals and housing? Who will stand up?

#### The permutation fails -- solutions cannot be approached through the rubric of gains or reversals in struggles with the state and civil society

13-14, Reagan RB for michklab\]

Regarding the Black position, [some might ask why, after claims
successfully made on the state by the Civil Rights Movement, do I insist
on]{.underline} posting an operational analytic for cinema, film
studies, and political theory that appears to be [a [dichotomous and
essentialist pairing of Masters and Slaves]{.mark}]{.underline}? In
other words, [why should we think of]{.underline} today's
[Blacks]{.underline} in the US [as Slaves and everyone else]{.underline}
(with the exception of Indians) as [Masters?]{.underline} One could
answer these questions by demonstrating how [nothing remotely
approaching "claims successfully made on the State" have come to
pass.]{.underline} But that would lead us in the wrong direction; we
would find ourselves on "solid" ground, which would only mystify, rather
than clarify, the question. [[We would be forced to appeal to "facts,"
the "historical record]{.mark}," and empirical markers of stasis and
change, all of which could be turned on their head with more of the
same. Underlying such a downward spiral]{.underline} into sociology,
political science, history, and/or public policy debates [would be the
very rubric that I am calling into question: [the grammar of
suffering]{.mark} known as exploitation and alienation, [the assumptive
logic whereby subjective dispossession is arrived at in the calculations
between those who sell labor power and those who acquire
it]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Black qua the worker. Orlando Patterson has
already dispelled this faulty ontological grammar in Slavery and Social
Death, where he demonstrates how and why work, or [forced labor, is not
a constituent element of slavery. Once the "solid" plank of "work" is
removed from slavery, then the conceptually coherent notion of "claims
against the state"---[the proposition that the state and]{.mark} [civil
society are elastic enough to even contemplate the possibility of an
emancipatory project for the Black position]{.mark}---disintegrates into
thin air. The imaginary of the state and [civil society]{.mark} [is
parasitic on the Middle Passage]{.mark}. Put another way: [no slave, no
world. And]{.mark}]{.underline}, in addition, as Patterson argues, [[no
slave is in]{.mark} [the world]{.mark}.]{.underline} If, as an
ontological position, that is, as a grammar of suffering, [the Slave is
not a laborer but an anti-Human, a positionality against which Humanity
establishes, maintains, and renews it coherence]{.underline}, its
corporeal integrity; if [[the Slave is,]{.underline}]{.mark} to borrow
from Patterson, [[generally dishonored]{.mark}, perpetually [open to
gratuitous]{.mark} [violence]{.mark}, and void of kinship
structure,]{.underline} that is, having no relations that need be
recognized, a being outside of relationality[, then our analysis cannot
be approached through the rubric of gains or reversals in struggles with
the state and civil society]{.underline}, not unless and until the
interlocutor first explains how the Slave is of the world. The onus is
not on one who posits the Master/Slave dichotomy, but on one who argues
there is a distinction between Slaveness and Blackness. How, when, and
where did such a split occur? The woman at the gates of Columbia
University awaits an answer.

#### Policing DA -- The permutation fails because it includes the destructive policing of blackness as an afterthought or part of an exasperated laundry list catalog of equivalents. This fails to center anti-black, white supremacist policing as the constitutive condition of the entire structural network of violent domination and thereby misunderstands the truth of the social order. This failure of centering structures the affirmative politics to the anti-blackness of white civil society, leading to the inevitable amplification of state power and white supremacist violence.

The upshot of this predicament is that **[[obscuring the structural
position of]{.mark} the category of [blackness]{.mark} will inevitably
[undermine multiracial coalition building as a politics of radical
opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}** and, to that extent, force the
question of black liberation back to the center of discussion. **[[Every
analysis that attempts to understand the complexities of racial
rule]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and the machinations of the racial
state]{.underline}** **[[without accounting for black existence]{.mark}
within its framework]{.underline}**---**[which does not mean simply
listing it among a chain of equivalents or]{.underline}** returning to
it as an **[afterthought]{.underline}**---[**[is doomed to miss what is
essential about the situation]{.underline}**. **[Black existence does
not represent the total reality of the racial
formation]{.underline}**]{.mark}---it is not the beginning and the end
of the story---**[[but it does relate to the totality]{.mark}; it
indicates the (repressed) truth of the political and economic
system.]{.underline}** That is to say, [**[the whole range of positions
within the racial formation is most fully understood from this vantage
point]{.underline}**,]{.mark} not unlike the way in which the range of
gender and sexual variance under patriarchal and heteronormative regimes
is most fully understood through lenses that are feminist and queer. 75
**[[What is lost for the study of black existence in the proposal
for]{.mark} a decentered[, "postblack" paradigm is a proper analysis of
the]{.mark} true scale and [nature of black suffering]{.mark} and of the
struggles]{.underline}**---political, aesthetic, intellectual, and so
on---that have sought to transform and undo it. **[[What is lost for the
study of nonblack nonwhite existence is a proper analysis of the]{.mark}
true scale and [nature of its material and symbolic power]{.mark}
relative to the category of blackness]{.underline}**. 76 This is why
**[[every attempt to defend the rights]{.mark} and liberties [of the
latest victims of state repression will fail to make substantial gains
insofar as it forfeits or sidelines the fate of
blacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the prototypical targets of the panoply
of police practices and the juridical infrastructure built up around
them. **[[Without blacks on board, the only viable political
option]{.mark} and the only effective defense against the intensifying
cross fire [will involve greater alliance with an antiblack civil
society]{.mark} and further capitulation to the magnification of state
power]{.underline}**. At the apex of the midcentury social movements,
Kwame Ture and Charles Hamilton wrote in their 1968 classic, Black
Power: The Politics of Liberation, that **[black freedom entails "the
necessarily total revamping of the society."]{.underline}** 77 For
Hartman, thinking of the entanglements of the African diaspora in this
context, **[the necessarily total revamping of the society is more
appropriately envisioned as the creation of an entirely new
world:]{.underline}**I knew that no matter how far from home I traveled,
I would never be able to leave my past behind. I would never be able to
imagine being the kind of person who had not been made and marked by
slavery. I was black and a history of terror had produced that identity.
**[Terror was "captivity without the possibility of flight," inescapable
violence, precarious life. There was no going back to a time or place
before slavery, and going beyond it no doubt would entail nothing less
momentous than yet another revolution]{.underline}**. 78

#### The perm inscribes meaning into the political and to the world. It promotes a futurity that is not accessible to the black subject. Proves that the perm is just as bad as the aff and there is mutual exclusivity

**Warren 15** (Calvin Warren. Black Interiority, Freedom, and the

[Meaning itself is an aspect of anti-blackne]{.underline}ss, such [that
meaning is lost for the black]{.underline}; [[blacks live in a world of
absurdity]{.mark}, and this existential absurdity is meaning for the
world. Meaninglessness is really all there is (or we could say that
"real" meaning for the world is utter meaninglessness)]{.underline}. In
an interview with Mark Sinker, Greg Tate provided are conceptualization
of meaning when he stated, "[the bar between the signifier and the
signified could be understood as standing for the Middle passage that
separated signification from sign]{.underline}" (Sinker 1991). [[The
very structure of meaning in the modern world]{.mark}---signifier,
signified, signification, and sign---[depends on anti-black violence for
its constitution]{.mark}. Not only does the trauma of the Middle passage
rupture the signifying process, but [it]{.mark} also [instantiates a
"meaningless" sign as the foundation of language]{.mark},
[meaning]{.mark}, [and social existence itself]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Following the work of Nicolas Abrahamand Maria Torok(1986),[we could
suggest that the meaninglessness of anti-black violence is the
"crypt-signifier" that organizes the modern world and its
institutions.]{.underline} Any "[meaning" that is
articulate]{.underline}d possesses a kernel of absurdity [that blacks
embody as "fleshy signs." The "meaninglessness" that Cornel West bemoans
is nothing more than the kernel of nonsense that an anti-black world
attempts to conceal with its discourses of hope and
futurity]{.underline}. What the black nihilist does is bring this
meaninglessness to the fore and disclose it in all of its terroristic
historicity.

### AT: Perm

In response to the events of September 11, 2001, the United States of
America unleashed "a war on terror" strongly supported by Britain,
Spain, and Australia. While these events and what followed have been
discussed by numerous scholars, we discuss briefly the "new" global
security imaginary that emerged in the post-9/11 world. We conceptualize
the global security imaginary as "a way of naming, ordering and
representing" international security (Mälksoo 2006). It is this
imaginary that draws boundaries, constructs identities and danger, and
performs security (see Muppidi 1999; Weldes 1999). We suggest that [the
two conventional pillars of IR---the nation-state and
sovereignty---remain central to the construction of this imaginary
leading to a renewed interest in issues of national identity and
citizenship in metropolitan centers.]{.underline} In the previous
section, we have discussed the ways in which race is foundational to the
sovereignty narrative. In this section we draw on Burton et al.\'s
engagement with the "imperial turn" to discuss the ways in which a
racialized global security imaginary which serves the needs of
metropolitan centers recuperates and reinscribes race into IR in
significant ways through the twin concept of the nation-state.

[[While the nation-state and sovereignty are constitutive of
conventional IR]{.mark}, [it]{.mark} generally [treats the nation-state
as given and does not take seriously questions regarding its
construction, its nature, and its identity]{.mark}.]{.underline}
However, [[critical interventions into IR]{.underline}]{.mark} (based on
the historical sociology and anthropology of the state)
[[interrogate]{.mark} the [nation-state project]{.mark} and suggest that
the nation is not based on pre-existing identities; rather the state
inscribes "an imagined political community" to legitimize its national
and sovereign status]{.underline} (Anderson 1983)**[. The importance of
understanding the nation as an imagined, political, cultural, and social
project cannot be overstated for it demonstrates that the nation is not
pre-given but is constructed and needs to constantly produce and
reproduce itself]{.underline}** (Campbell 1990). The construction of the
imagined political community relies on the construction of a
noncommunity, the "other," the enemy, and maintenance of internal and
external boundaries based on these constructions. [Race, ethnicity,
gender, religion, caste, class, and so on are crucial elements in the
constructions of national boundaries, working particularly through the
concept of citizenship]{.underline}. The concept of citizenship defines
who belongs to the nation and who does not; those who do not belong
could be both within and outside the nation. Citizenship uses race, for
instance, as an exclusionary mechanism to maintain the territorial
integrity and identity of the nation legally and metaphorically defining
those who really belong to the "imagined community" and others who are
excluded from this community.

The [focus]{.underline} of [scholarship]{.underline} assessing the
impact of the "imperial turn" on metropolitan societies, including
postcolonial and cultural studies scholarship, [[provides a unique
vantage from]{.mark} [which to examine the racialized politics of
identity, nation, and citizenship]{.mark} as well as sovereignty in
metropolitan societies under the new global security
imaginary]{.underline} (see, e.g., Burton 2003). According to Burton
(2003), the "imperial turn" means focusing on the postcolonial fate of
metropolitan societies. Burton, following scholars like Said (1978,
1993), Hall (1997), Gilroy (1987, 1993), [and]{.underline} Spivak
(1993), is referring both to the ontological and physical presence of
empire in Britain (and by extension in the United States) demonstrating
the contrapuntal engagement of empire with nation, both in the context
of metropolitan centers and postcolonial societies.7

We take the "the imperial turn" to mean the [accelerated attention to
the impact of histories of imperialism on metropolitan societies in the
wake of decolonization, pre- and post-1968 racial struggle]{.underline}
and feminism in the last quarter century. The democratization of the
North American academy, however glacial and incomplete at the twentieth
century\'s end, is partly the result of these social/political
movements. They have in turn created new constituencies insistent on
histories that explain the experiences of colonial and ex-colonial
peoples---and account for the persistently racialized "Others"---in
postcolonial metropolitan societies. Those constituencies are the legacy
of several generations of black Europeans---and here I refer not just to
the colonized in distant lands, but also to those "at the other end of
the imperial chain, inside Europe as citizens, bystanders and
sojourners." (Burton 2003:2)

However, there has always existed a paradoxical tension in metropolitan
centers between the needs of metropolitan centers serviced by racialized
others and their "problematized" presence. The needs of metropolitan
centers attract populations to it but also contain and shape their
inclusion as well as their exclusion. The ghettos of subalterneity that
emerge tell us about both, the expanded needs of metropolitan power and
its servicing by the subaltern other. Under the new global security
imaginary, debates around belonging and citizenship have gained a
heightened presence in the metropolitan centers. [[The rise of new
nationalisms and nativist responses against racialized citizens]{.mark},
bystanders, and sojourners---[marked as foreign/"others" who do not
really belong in the national landscape]{.mark}---[are aided]{.mark} and
abetted [by nation-states]{.mark} and their discourses about citizens,
immigrants, and security which reinscribe whiteness into national
identity.]{.underline}

In the wake of September 11, 2001, and the subsequent bombings in Madrid
and London, these discourses of identity and citizenship have acquired a
strident character in metropolitan centers. For example, the British
state has responded by at least partially identifying the problem and
its fix in issues of identity. In a double move, one that both seeks to
include and exclude racialized others, it has called for a "emphatic
reassertion of Britain and British-ness" (Preston 2007:159). These calls
can be seen as a desire for inclusion through expanding notions of
Britishness to include historically racialized others.8 However, much of
the efforts at inclusion reflect what we have called above the museum
approach of inclusion. Through this, a fixing of identities takes
shape---of display without engagement of inclusion based on exclusions.
Multicultural citizenship discourses are deployed at the same time to
emphasize the openness of the metropolis and to ghettoize the other as
bound by traditions incomprehensible to the tolerant modern culture
within which they find place and yet remain separate and impregnated
with danger, always sitting uneasily within the imagined community of
the nation. These calls for inclusion can be seen, thus, as a
hyperracialized revival of the discourse of cultural otherness in which
"others" are portrayed as a civilizational and territorial security
threats. But what of the voices of the "ghettos"? Peripheral and
contained perhaps, but also escaping and disturbing the dominant flows
of communications. Worried by all sorts of internal
demons---accountability, authenticity, representation---engagement with
the dominant flows of communication display postcolonial anxieties that
do not make for "easy listening" of neat composition. The internal
disturbance resonates in the fractured, sometimes tortured articulations
of anger, but also in alternative visions of changing landscapes.

[Both the museum and the ghetto models of inclusion/exclusion nurture
the sovereignty narrative of nation-states and national identities in
which clear and demarcated boundaries separate nations and citizens from
one another]{.underline}. The mutual embeddedness of nation and empire
in national identity construction, for example, which challenges the
enclosures of the sovereignty narrative are glossed over. Stuart Hall\'s
discussion of British identity is instructive of this mutual embeddeness
and provides an interesting alternative to sovereignty in
conceptualizing the nation and national identity.

People like me who came to England in the 1950s have been there for
centuries; symbolically we have been there for centuries . . . I am the
sugar at the bottom of the English cup of tea. I am the sweet tooth, the
sugar plantations that rotted generations of English children\'s teeth.
There are thousands of others beside me that are, you know, the cup of
tea itself. Because they don't grow it in Lancashire, you know. Not a
single tea planatation exists within the United Kingdom. This is the
symbolization of English identity---I mean, what does anybody know about
an English person except that they can't get through the day without a
cup of tea?

Where does it come from? Ceylon---Sri Lanka, India. That is the outside
history that is inside the history of the English. [There is no English
history without that other history. [The notion that identity
has]{.mark} [to do with people that look the same, call themselves the
same is nonsense]{.mark}. As a process, as a narrative, as a discourse,
it is always told from the position of the other.]{.underline} (Hall
1997:48--49)

## Alternatives

### Alt: Burn It Down

#### The alternative is to reject the affirmative as an act of burning down the civil society that produces violence against the slave. Freedom is an illusion created by the shackles of civil society and abandoning the pursuit for equality is the only way to break down the way that whiteness maintains itself.

**Farley 04** {Anthony Paul; Associate prof at Boston college Law
school; "perfecting slavery"; pg 235-238; January 27 2005}AvP

[What is to be done? Two hundred years ago, [when the slaves in Haiti
rose up, they]{.mark}, of necessity, [burned
everything]{.mark}]{.underline}: They burned San Domingo flat so that at
the end of the war it was a charred desert. Why do you burn everything?
asked a French officer of a prisoner. We have a right to burn what we
cultivate because a man has a right to dispose of his own labour, was
the reply of this unknown anarchist.48 [[The slaves burned everything
because everything was against them]{.mark}. Everything was against the
slaves, the entire order that it was their lot to follow, the entire
order in which they were positioned as worse than senseless things,
every plantation, everything.]{.underline}49 **[["Leave nothing white
behind you,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** said Toussaint to those dedicated to
the end of white-overblack. 50 "God gave Noah the rainbow sign. No more
water, the fire next time."51 The slaves burned everything, yes, but,
unfortunately, they only burned everything in Haiti.52 [[Theirs was the
greatest and most successful revolution in the history of the
world]{.mark} but the failure of their fire to cross the waters was the
great tragedy of the Nineteenth century**.**]{.underline}53 At the dawn
of the Twentieth century, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote, "The colorline belts the
world."54 Du Bois said that the problem of the Twentieth century was the
problem of the colorline.55 The problem, now, at the dawn of the
Twenty-first century is the problem of the colorline. The colorline
continues to belt the world. Indeed, [the slave power that is
[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates now [threatens a]{.mark}n
entire [world with the death that it has become and so the
slaves]{.mark} of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, those with nothing but
their chains to lose, [must]{.mark}, if they would be free, if they
would escape slavery, [win the entire world]{.mark}.]{.underline} win
the entire world. VIII. TRAINING We begin as children. We are called and
we become our response to the call. Slaves are not called. What becomes
of them? What becomes of the broken-hearted? The slaves are divided
souls, they are brokenhearted, the slaves are split asunder by what they
are called upon to become. The slaves are called upon to become objects
but objecthood is not a calling. The slave, then, during its loneliest
loneliness, is divided from itself. This is schizophrenia. The slaves
are not called, or, rather, the slaves are called to not be. [The slaves
are called unfree and thus the living can never be and so the slaves
burst apart and die. The [slaves begin as death]{.mark}, not as
children, and [death is]{.mark} not a beginning but [an end. There is no
progress and no exit from the]{.mark} undiscovered country of the
[slave]{.mark}, or so it seems. [We are trained to think through a
progress narrative]{.mark}, a grand narrative, the grandest narrative[,
that takes us up from slavery. There is no up from
slavery.]{.mark}]{.underline} The progress from white-over-black to
white-over-black to white-overblack. The progress of slavery runs in the
opposite direction of the past-present- future timeline. [[The slave
only becomes the perfect slave at the end of the timeline]{.mark}, only
[under conditions of total juridical freedom.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is
only under conditions of freedom, of bourgeois legality, that the slave
can perfect itself as a slave by freely choosing to bow down before its
master. The slave perfects itself as a slave by offering a prayer for
equal rights. [[The system of marks is a plantation]{.mark}. The system
of property is a plantation. The system of law is a plantation. These
plantations, all part of the same system, hierarchy, produce
white-overblack, white-over-black only, and that
continually.]{.underline} The slave perfects itself as a slave through
its prayers for equal rights. [The plantation system will not commit
suicide and the slave, as stated above, has knowing non-knowledge of
this fact. **[The slave finds its way back from the undiscovered country
only by burning down every plantation.]{.mark}**]{.underline} When the
slave prays for equal rights it makes the free choice to be dead, and it
makes the free choice to not be.

### Alt: Unflinching Paradigmatic Analysis

**Vote negative to engage in an unflinching structural analysis of the
ontological position of Blackness---the very possibility of ethics and
freedom resides in a rejection of the affirmative's ratification of
democracy, the state and civil society. Resisting the lure of
anti-blackness through a genealogy of history's constitutive void is the
starting point for imagining a new world.**

**Kokontis 2011 (**Kate, PhD in Performance Studies from UC-Berkeley,
"Performative Returns and the Rememory of History: genealogy and
performativity in the American racial state," Dissertation available on
Proquest)

On one hand, she addresses the literal politics that the theological
narratives espouse. There is a long tradition of deploying the Exodus
narrative toward the pursuit of social reform. That is, instead of
appealing to it in a way that focuses on the next world, "\[t\]hrough
biblical typology, particularly uses of Exodus, African Americans
elevated their common experiences to biblical drama and found resources
to account for their circumstances and respond effectively to them.
\[\...\] Exodus history sustained hope and a sense of possibility in the
face of insurmountable evil. The analogical uses of the story enabled
[[a sense of agency]{.mark} and resistance]{.underline} in persistent
moments of despair and disillusionment."64 But even these efforts have
-- not exclusively, but often -- relied on a particular iteration of the
social gospel that [[presupposes a set of moral]{.mark} and
institutional [imperatives]{.mark} (for instance, the ideal of training
racial, religious, sexual, social, or institutional "deviants" or
outlyers to behave according to an ostensibly correct set of moral
principles) [that run counter to a radical critique of]{.mark} the
underlying terms of [the state and civil society which tend to]{.mark}
ratify, naturalize, and [invisibilize antiblackness]{.mark} and/or
policies that adversely impact black people who are not part of the
middle class, rather than to critique or subvert it]{.underline}.
Hartman, on the other hand, does call for, and mount, a radical critique
of the terms of [[the state and civil society]{.underline}]{.mark}: for
her, [they [are]{.mark} inherently [unethical]{.mark} rather than
redeemable[, having engendered centuries of black social death]{.mark}
and historical unknowability, and [thus any struggle toward freedom
demands an unflinching]{.mark} critical [analysis rather than an
implicit]{.mark} or explicit [ratification of these institutions]{.mark}
and the terms on which they are predicated.]{.underline} But more
fundamentally, she addresses the political implications of the
assumptive logic of a theological teleology. I interpret Hartman to
posit that there is a kind of freedom that can be predicated on
not-knowing: if there is no predetermined future, there is no divine
imperative that might encourage an investment in the moral prescriptions
of a conservative social gospel: [[a toppled faith in the redemptive
possibilities of the struggle has the potential to open the door to
invention,]{.mark} speculation, []{.mark}refashioning, and cobbling
together something from nothing, []{.mark}presence from absence. I
interpret her to posit that [a]{.mark} viable [freedom dream
necessitates the acknowledgment of loss]{.mark} and absence [and the
history of processes of dehumanizing antiblackness, the acknowledgement
of the wound]{.mark} and its psychic, social, political, and ethical
causes [-- as well as an acknowledgement of its persistence]{.mark} --
rather than being deluded by tidy or optimistic but under-analyzed
narratives of progress or redemption. Only then can any realistic stock
be taken toward re-imagining the world and the possibilities and
imperatives of a black freedom struggle]{.underline}. While Haley and
[Gates draw on narratives that say that]{.underline} the
[past]{.underline}, including its [suffering, was meaningful,
[Hartman]{.mark} offers]{.underline} what might appear to be [a much
bleaker interpretation that insists that it is meaningless insofar as it
is not folded into any sort of teleology. But in that is a kind of
freedom]{.underline}/dream, [because the subjects of her narrative are
free from a predetermination of the terms on which liberation is
possible]{.underline}, the structures around its enactment. What [she
calls for is a profound refashioning of the epistemology of the
invisible]{.underline}, which is as fundamental a component of the black
freedom struggle as is an epistemology of verifiable evidence of
oppression. That is, [she [advocates the excavation of psychic
structures]{.mark} and historical silences [to replace an
implicit]{.mark} or explicit [faith in a divine logic in the (racial)
order of things.]{.mark} Genealogy cannot connect with the unknown, so
it becomes a ghost story, an excavation]{.underline}. The term might
then be interpreted less as a means of accessing literal ancestors, and
more as a process toward understanding. [Hartman
constructs]{.underline}, in her text, not a genealogy of anyone's
family, but [a genealogy]{.underline} of the stranger, of [the
slave]{.underline}; a genealogy of loss, of the lost, of searching.
[Projects that make use of imaginative]{.underline}, performative,
quasi-fictional or poetic [devices can't rest with
not-knowing]{.underline}: **[[the imaginative devices emerge,]{.mark} in
fact, [from attempts to piece together]{.mark} or construct/invent
[evidence from its lack.]{.mark}]{.underline}** They all insist on the
importance of knowing, whether because of some large-scale sense of
collective responsibility, or because of personal yearning, or both.
[[The imaginative devices]{.mark} don't exist for the sake of being
imaginative; they [exist for the sake of survival.]{.mark} But [in being
imaginative, they allow for]{.mark} radical [possibilities to emerge
that literality forecloses]{.mark}]{.underline}. Part of what
performance might offer the study of history is a) different keys to be
able to fill in the gaps, that aren't so heavily reliant upon explicit,
legible empiricism, and b) not only permission for, but encouragement of
what uncertainty can yield. Genealogy, broadly understood, is what
furnishes evidence: it is the key to filling in blanks that are
impossible to fill. One version of it is capable of being profoundly
literal; of making reconstruction possible; it is used to fill in the
blank that has been lost to us -- whomever the 'us' is: the
dispossessed, displaced, marginalized -- providing an object to slip
into a gaping negative space. This I would call
[[genealogy]{.underline}]{.mark} as an object. A different version [[is
used in order to understand the gaps, to]{.mark} underscore or
[illuminate the negative spaces and ask how they came to be]{.mark}, and
filling in the context around the blank spaces, inheriting the loss,
becomes the way to trace the relationship between the past, present, and
future]{.underline}. This I would call genealogy as a process. [What,
then, is or could be critical or even radical in roots-seeking genealogy
projects]{.underline}? There is something inherently conservative about
nostalgia, according to most interpretations; but not if a notion of
"radical nostalgia," such as that offered by Peter Glazer, is pursued:
such an enactment of notalgia engages in worldmaking and invention; the
definition takes for granted that nostalgia is for worlds and times that
never existed, and that therefore it is not conservative (i.e. about
returning to an idealized past), but that it is creative and always
seeking something new. Performative returns are inevitably projects of
yearning, of wishing for a past that was imagined to be better than the
present (which has devolved in some way) or a future that has promise
and potential. The mythical Aztec homeland Aztlán that was made popular
during the Chicano Movement is a very elegant example: it is a
wished-for, utopian space, acknowledged as being impossible to realize,
but always animating the spirit of the concrete efforts of its adherents
toward social justice and structural change (see Anaya and Lomelí 1991).
Hartman writes: [["To believe]{.underline}]{.mark}, as I do, that [[the
enslaved **are our contemporaries** is to]{.underline}]{.mark}
understand that we share their aspirations and defeats, which isn't to
say that we are owed what they were due but rather to [[acknowledge that
they accompany our every effort to fight against domination]{.mark}, to
abolish the color line, and to imagine a free territory, a new
commons]{.underline}. It is to take to heart their knowledge of freedom.
The enslaved knew that freedom had to be taken; it wasn't something that
could ever be given to you. [[The kind of freedom that could be given to
you could just as easily be taken back]{.underline}. \[\...\] [The
demands of the slave]{.underline}]{.mark} [on the present have
everything to do with making good the promise of abolition, and this
entails much more than the end of property in slaves. It [requires the
reconstruction of society,]{.mark} which is the only way to honor our
debt to the dead. This is the intimacy of our age with theirs -- an
unfinished struggle. To what end does one conjure the ghost of slavery,
if not to incite the hopes of transforming the present]{.underline}?"
(Hartman 2007, 269-270). But performative return is not necessarily
critical, and part of what I demonstrate throughout this dissertation is
how such projects are always more complicated than they seem; they work
to challenge and bolster the racial state; they are in some ways radical
and in others extremely conservative. And this question of criticality
has precisely to do with normativity: do genealogical practices, the
conclusions they draw and the worldmaking they do, work to undo or to
reinscribe oppressive patterns, habits, worldviews, available roles of
and categories for historically marginalized groups of people? All three
of [these projects]{.underline} [attempt to re-write]{.underline} the
terms of America, such that the circumstances of
[African-Americans]{.underline} are configured [as being integral
instead of outside the dominant narrative;]{.underline} constitutive
rather than an aberration. [But they waver between trying to write that
as a narrative of progress, in which we have left slavery behind and
have ascended to a space of constitutive normativity; and trying to
underline the fundamental and unending nature of slavery -- a kind of
rejoinder to uncritical narratives that not only attends to the
subjective space of social death that it has yielded but the
possibilities and necessities of invention that have flourished in its
wake[.]{.mark}]{.underline} What they have in common is that they
present the necessity of grappling with the past instead of ignoring it,
allowing African-Americans' movements and reinscriptions of migration to
trouble the waters of complacency, forging a broader awareness of the
fraught position they have historically occupied. Each contains kernels
of great possibility for an inclusive vision of the future as well as
more or less significant red flags. [[Hartman]{.mark}'s vision, however,
[seems to espouse a particularly liberating articulation of
freedom]{.mark}, because it does not try to deny or occlude the presence
or significance of ongoing disparity and loss]{.underline}: while Gates'
and [Haley's subjects and implied audience have already succeeded,
gained access to civil society, and have implicitly ratified the
fundamental terms on which it is predicated, Hartman's are still
struggling to make something from nothing; they have an urgency in
attending to disparities, and no investment in a status quo that
excludes or violates their well-being. [What she]{.mark} claims or
[advocates is]{.mark} not a victimized stance, but rather [a staunch
activist one that is inflected by a rigorous and unflinching structural
analysis]{.mark}, and a sensitive and equally rigorous understanding of
desire, yearning, and the possibilities for reinvention and
reconstruction that emerge when faced with profound absence and
loss.]{.underline}

### Alt: Interrogate IR

While there now exists a growing, albeit sparse, literature on "race"1
in international relations (see, e.g., Grovogui 1996; Persaud 1997,
2002; Krishna 2001; Persaud and Walker 2001; Ling 2002;Doty 2003;
Inayatullah and Blaney 2003; Chowdhry and Nair 2002; Agathangelou 2006),
[[race]{.mark} [has]{.mark} yet [to be included as an]{.mark} analytical
[category shaping the study of International Relations]{.mark} (IR)2 in
a systematic way]{.underline}. From being an addendum[, we now do have
postcolonial voices represented on IR panels in conferences and as
chapters in books. However, [these voices often echo in
isolation]{.mark}, [speaking to none and not being spoken]{.mark}
with---providing legitimacy without occupying a "legitimate" place
within these discursive spaces. Further, the "hearing" of postcolonial
voices that focus on race often takes the form of illustrative
engagements leading to museum-like displays of the exoticized
other---teaching us about civilizations declined, peripheral but
colorful examples of weakness in one or other form.]{.underline} This
illustrative power holds sway in curricula through which metropolitan
powers teach their own as well as the elites of emerging
economies---both servicing the needs of the metropolis[. When the day is
done, the glass cabinets with their displays of decline of
civilizational pasts can be locked away in darkened rooms, having
created value in instruction without engaging the stories told by the
displays or incorporating them [into the stories of
IR.]{.mark}]{.underline}

These [[erasures of race in the stories of IR are made possible through
a series of ontological and epistemological
maneuvers]{.underline}]{.mark} (Shaw 2002:62). These maneuvers structure
the [[emergence of a "common sense]{.mark}" [regarding the boundaries of
IR]{.mark}.]{.underline} Race, together with gender, is generally not
included within these boundaries nor is there much curiosity about the
racialized foundations of IR. In this essay, we suggest that **[[race
can be integrated into the teaching of IR]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[by
focusing on the ways in which these ontological and epistemological
maneuvers structure the geographies and politics of exclusion and
inclusion in IR regarding questions of sovereignty and identity, nation
and nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Focusing on "this doubly
constituted inclusion/exclusion" allows us to not only explore the ways
in which race can be foregrounded in discussions about sovereignty and
identity, nation and nationalism, but it also enables an exploration of
how the silences around race have "allowed the discipline to reproduce
itself in the image of western man and the Great Powers" (Persaud
2002:58).

The questions of sovereignty and identity, nation and nationalism, have
recently gained a renewed currency in both the writing and practice of
IR, as the mappings of old and new forms of exclusions and inclusions
are legitimized through the production of a somewhat new global security
imaginary.3 The global security imaginary situates "danger" globally;
danger "is no longer capable of being written as just 'out there.'
Security is not to be found 'within'" (Campbell 1990:175). In addition
to the erasure of the inside--outside distinction so fundamental to the
conventional field of IR, the global security imaginary is no longer
only contained within military security discourses or the discourses
associated with political economy[. The securitization of identity,
culture and religion, nation and nationalism have all become the bases
of this new global security imaginary.]{.underline} While there is
recent scholarship in IR that addresses several aspects of the new
global security imaginary, the racialized and gendered foundations of
this new imaginary have yet to be fully explored. In this essay, we
suggest that [the global security imaginary functions on the
exploitation of difference and the geographies of exclusions and
inclusions that we discuss]{.underline}. In addition, we explore the
ways in which the racialized foundations of this imaginary intersect
with identity, nation, and security to service the needs of metropolitan
centers.

### Alt: Arms black people

#### The primary purpose of arms is to regulate the bodies and movement of POC. The alt is to give the arms to black people -- Arming has historically been the only way to ward off/escape continuous white oppression.

<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/04/11/why-killer-mike-is-right-african-americans-should-own-guns/?utm_term=.aa02794caa75>

Last month, hip-hop artist Killer Mike used an interview conducted by
the National Rifle Association's media arm, NRATV, to advocate for black
gun ownership, chiding members of his community for being "lackeys" of
the white gun-control movement. The interview prompted fierce social
media blowback. Many argued that Killer Mike's words merely served as
fodder for the NRA's attempt to undermine the youth-led March for Our
Lives.

Days later, Killer Mike issued a two-part video apology on Twitter. The
NRA "used the interview to disparage a very noble campaign that I
support. My interview was supposed to be something that continued a
conversation," he clarified, "a conversation about African American gun
ownership in these times. We have to remember in our allyship \[with
whites\] that we still have to make sure there are certain rights and
demands that we make for us and our community. ... I support the march
and black people owning guns."

Although the controversy surrounding Killer Mike's interview and apology
received significant publicity, few have properly situated it in the
history of white supremacy and gun policy. [From the earliest days of
the American colonies, [gun laws have aimed to arm whites and disarm
people of color]{.mark} and indigenous people, [part of the quest to
maintain white supremacy]{.mark}. [People of]{.mark} [color]{.mark} and
indigenous people have long fought against this double standard,
[recognizing that gun ownership can be integral to securing
equality]{.mark} --- especially in a country where white gun ownership
is valorized and protected.]{.underline}

From the earliest days of European colonization, [[gun laws served as a
proxy for regulating and containing people of color]{.mark}]{.underline}
and indigenous people. In 1647, "The Laws and Liberties of
Massachusetts" banned any man from repairing "any gun, small or great,
belonging to any Indian. ... Nor shall sell or give to any Indian,
directly or indirectly any such gun, or any gun-powder, shot or lead, or
shotmould, or any militarie weapons or armour." Punishment entailed a
fine of 10 pounds or, absent that, corporal punishment.

Connecticut replicated this statute almost word for word in 1650. Ten
years later[, [Connecticut officials declared that
"Negroes]{.mark}"]{.underline} and "Indians" [[were exempt from serving
in the militia]{.mark}, which for practical purposes meant they could
not possess firearms.]{.underline}

Such laws spread over the next 200 years. For example, in 1712, [[South
Carolina]{.mark} [disqualified slaves from gun ownership]{.mark} on
account of their "barbarous, wild, savage natures," as they could not be
"governed by the laws, customs and practices of this Province." [This
prohibition aimed to "restrain the disorders]{.mark}, rapines and
inhumanity to which they are naturally prone and inclined; and may also
tend to the safety and security of the people of this Province and their
estates."]{.underline}

In the aftermath of the ratification of the Constitution, a number of
states sought to enact laws spelling out the racial boundaries of gun
policy. [In 1825, [Florida's]{.mark} "Act to Govern Patrols" [provided
that white]{.mark} [citizens]{.mark} "[shall enter into all negro
houses]{.mark} and suspected places, and search for arms and other
offensive or improper weapons, [and may lawfully seize]{.mark} and [take
away all such arms,]{.mark} weapons, and ammunition."]{.underline}

From the outset, [people of color]{.underline} and indigenous people
[understood that disarming them was an integral piece of subjugating
them --- and]{.underline} accordingly [resisted]{.underline}. In the
19th century, [Harriet Tubman rescued hundreds from slavery while armed
with a pistol]{.underline} and a three-foot-long ivory-handled sword. In
1893, a year after black abolitionist [Ida B. Wells]{.underline}
published "Southern Horrors," a text detailing the lynchings of black
people in the South, she [observed that "the Winchester rifle deserved a
place of honor in every Black home, and it should be used for that
protection which the law refuses to give."]{.underline}

[Leaders of the 20th-century struggle for civil rights recognized the
[ongoing need for self-defense in the form of gun
ownership]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [even Martin Luther King
Jr]{.underline}., one of the staunchest advocates of nonviolence,
[applied for a concealed carry permit]{.underline} in 1956 after his
house was bombed. Although his application was denied, armed supporters
guarded his home.

Contrary to mainstream narratives that highlight nonviolence, [[firearms
were central to the modern civil rights movement]{.mark}. Influential
organizations such as the Louisiana-based Deacons for Defense and
Justice protected nonviolent demonstrations by the Congress of Racial
Equality (CORE) against Ku Klux Klan violence by bringing their guns to
protests. Malcolm X and advocates of Black Power, including Robert
Williams, author of the 1962 bestseller "Negroes With [Guns]{.mark},"
believed that because the U.S. government was "either unable or
unwilling to protect the lives and property" [of black people, they had
to defend themselves "by]{.mark} [whatever means
necessary."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Maybe the best parallel to Killer Mike's orientation toward black gun
ownership was the stance taken by the Black Panther Party a half-century
ago.

[The Panthers first took up arms]{.underline} in October 1966 [to
[defend members of their community]{.mark} against repeated harassment
and violence perpetrated by the]{.underline} Oakland
[Police]{.underline} Department. On May 2, 1967, a cadre of armed Black
Panthers ascended the steps of the California State Capital Building in
Sacramento. Co-founder Bobby Seale read a statement saying, "The time
has come for black people to arm themselves against this terror before
it is too late."

In a direct response to the demonstration, however, then-Gov. Ronald
Reagan signed [the Mulford Act]{.underline} (colloquially known as the
Panther Bill), which, according to the Los Angeles Times, banned "the
carrying of loaded weapons in most public places" in California. Reagan
endorsed the bill by saying that guns were a "ridiculous way to solve
problems that have to be solved among people of good will." As with
denying King a concealed-carry permit, it [was clear that white America
would not accept African Americans taking advantage of their right to
bear arms.]{.underline}

[[To this day, gun laws are wielded against black
Americans]{.underline}]{.mark}. White people may be more likely to own
or carry a gun, but black people are more likely to be imprisoned for
it, or shot for legally practicing their Second Amendment rights, a
reality most clearly exemplified by the 2016 shooting of Philando
Castile, for which police officer Jeronimo Yanez was acquitted of all
charges.

In his NRATV interview and subsequent apology, Killer Mike highlighted
the importance of having a serious and sustained national conversation
about black gun ownership in the United States. [Wherever one stands on
the issue of gun ownership, one must wrestle with the reality that
**firearms policy has for hundreds of years served to**]{.underline}
**[regulate the bodies and movement of people of color and indigenous
people.]{.underline}** [[Arming themselves has helped African Americans
escape subjugation and enjoy the equal rights promised to them by the
law]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given the fierce resistance to gun control,
Killer Mike just might be onto something.

### AT -- Alt Doesn't Solve

#### Impact turn- Productivity is mutually exclusive with acknowledgement of the black body. 

**Wilderson explains that...**

(Frank B. III "Introduction: Unspeakable Ethics" *Red, White, & Black:
Cinema and the Structure of U.S.* Antagonisms, Accessed: 4/30/14, NC)

Both Spillers and Eltis remind us that the archive of [African slavery
shows no internal recognition of the libidinal costs of turning human
bodies into sentient flesh. From Marx's reports on proposed
vagabond-into-slave legislation, it becomes clear that [the libidinal
economy]{.mark} of such European legislation [is far too unconsciously
invested in "saving" the symbolic value of]{.mark} the very [vagabonds
such laws consciously seek to enslave]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other
words, [[the law would rather shoot itself]{.mark} (that is, sacrifice
the economic development of the New World[) in the foot than step into a
subjective void where idlers and vagabonds might find themselves without
contemporaries, with no relational status to save.]{.mark} In this way,
White-on-White violence is put in check (a) before it becomes
gratuitous, or structural, before it can shred the fabric of civil
society beyond mending; and (b) before conscious, predictable, and
sometimes costly challenges are mounted against the legislation despite
its dissembling lack of resolve]{.underline}. This is accomplished by
the imposition of the numerous "on condition that..." and "supposing
that..." clauses bound up in the word "if" and also by claims bound up
in the language around the enslavement of European children: a White
child may be enslaved on condition that s/he is the child of a vagabond,
and then, only until the age of 20 or 24.

#### Engaging the state fails to provoke change and instead results in more of the same

\
[There are oppositional political movements of course; some are
progressive, fewer are radical.]{.underline} But each encounters a
certain internal limitation. For instance, there are movements seeking
to make the police more accountable to legal and communal standards of
conduct; [but [their role then becomes one of making the state work
better and more efficiently. They work, perhaps unwittingly, at
reconstructing and not dismantling the white state. What they fail to
understand or accept is that the police are already accountable, but to
something out of reach of the principles of justice or
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is a (largely symbolic)
multiracial or mixed race movement that understands itself to be the
very transcendence of race but[, [in mixing and matching races supposed
to really exist, it subsumes the products of racism in ways that recall
many dimensions of white supremacist thinking]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
ethic of retribution that legitimates the expanding prison-industrial
complex in the US and beyond is one of these products. Even political
opposition to that ethic outside the prison wall falls prey to a certain
acceptance of criminal law; in other words, it assumes that the prison
is essential to social order. This acceptance is unacceptable from the
point of view of the violence and violation engendered by the prison
regime. Political (or politicised) prisoners demand an epistemology of a
different order, one that challenges the internal limits of opposition
in a radical way --- the dream of prison abolition.

### AT -- Alt Violence

#### Fear of violence is a conservative political maneuver --the question is not whether or not there will be violence but whether it will be directed at an unjust social order

Aphasia and Abjection in the Political Trials of Black Insurgents, In

Many [[pacifist scholars and activists consider]{.mark} the strategies
and tactics of armed revolutionaries in First World]{.underline}
countries [to be short-sighted bursts of narcissism]{.underline}.xvii
What pacifist detractors forget, however, is that for Gramsci, the
strategy of [a [War of Position is one of commandeering]{.mark} civic
and political spaces one trench at a time in order to turn those [spaces
into pedagogic locales for the dispossessed]{.mark}]{.underline}; and
[this]{.underline} process is one which [combines peaceful as well as
violent tactics as it moves]{.underline} the struggle
[[closer]{.underline} [to an all-out violent assault on the
state.]{.underline}]{.mark} The BLA and their White revolutionary
co-defendants may have been better Gramscians than those who critique
them through the lens of Gramsci. Their tactics (and by tactics I mean
armed struggle as well as courtroom performances) were no less effective
at winning hearts and minds than candle light vigils and "orderly"
protests. [If the end-game of Gramscian struggle is the isolation and
emasculation of the ruling classes' ensemble of questions, as a way to
alter the structure of feeling of the dispossessed so that the next
step, [the violent overthrow of the state]{.mark}, [doesn't *feel l*ike
such a monumental undertaking]{.mark}, then I would argue [the pedagogic
value]{.mark} [of retaliating]{.mark} against police by killing one of
them [each time they kill a Black person]{.mark}, the expropriating of
bank funds from armored cars in order to further finance armed struggle
as well as community projects]{.underline} such as acupuncture clinics
in the Bronx where drug addicts could get clean, [and the bombing of
major centers of U.S. commerce and governance,]{.underline} followed by
trials in which the defendants used the majority of the trial to
critique the government rather than plead their case, [have as much if
not more pedagogic value than peaceful protest.]{.underline} In other
words, if not for the ["[pathological pacifism]{.mark}"]{.underline}
(Churchill) which [[clouds political debate]{.underline}]{.mark} and
scholarly analysis there would be no question that the BLA, having not
even read Gramsci,xviii were among the best Gramscian theorists the U.S.
has ever known[. But]{.underline} though the BLA were great Gramscian
theorists, they could not become Gramscian subjects. The political
character of [[one's actions is inextricably bound to the political
status of one's subjectivity]{.underline};]{.mark} and while this status
goes without saying for Gilbert and Clark, it is always in question for
Balagoon and Bukhari. \[34\] [How does one calibrate the gap between
objective vertigo and the need to be productive as a Black
revolutionary?]{.underline} What is the political significance of
restoring balance to the inner ear? [Is tyranny of closure the only
outcome of such interventions or could restoration of the Black
subject's inner ear, while [failing at the level of conceptual
framework]{.mark}, [provide something necessary]{.mark}, though
intangible, at [the level of blood and sweat political
activism]{.mark}?]{.underline} These unanswered questions haunt this
article. Though I have erred in this article on the side of paradigm as
opposed to praxis, and cautioned against assuming that we know or can
know what the harvest of their sacrifice was, I believe [we are better
political thinkers---[if not actors---as a result of what they did with
their bodies]{.mark}, [even if we still don't know what to do with
ours]{.mark}.]{.underline} \*

Soon it will be forty years since radical politics, Left-leaning
scholarship, and socially engaged feature films began to speak the
unspeakable. In the 1960s and early 1970s the questions asked by radical
politics and scholarship were not "**[[Should the U.S.]{.mark} [be
overthrown?"]{.mark} or even "Would it be overthrown?" but rather when
and how---and, for some, what---would come in its wake. [Those steadfast
in their conviction]{.mark} that there remained a discernable quantum of
ethics in the U.S. writ large]{.underline}** (and here I am speaking of
everyone from Martin Luther King, Jr., prior to his 1968 shift, to the
Tom Hayden wing of SDS, to thebn Julian Bond and Marion Barry faction of
SNCC, to Bobbie Kennedy Democrats) **[[were accountable]{.mark}, in
their rhetorical machinations, to the paradigmatic zeitgeist [of the
Black Panthers]{.mark}, the American Indian Movement, and the Weather
Underground. [Radicals]{.mark} and progressives [could deride, reject,
or chastise armed struggle mercilessly]{.mark} and cavalierly [with
respect]{.mark} to tactics and [the possibility o f "success,"]{.mark}
but they could not dismiss revolution-as-ethic because they could not
make a convincing case---by way of a paradigmatic analysis---that the
U.S. was an ethical formation and still hope to maintain credibility as
radicals and progressives.]{.underline}** Even Bobby Kennedy (a U.S.
attorney general and presidential candidate) mused that the law and its
enforcers had no ethical standing in the presence of Blacks. One could
(and many did) acknowledge America's strength and power. This seldom,
however, rose to the level of an ethical assessment, but rather remained
an assessment of the so-called "balance of forces." **[[The political
discourse of Blacks]{.mark}, and to a lesser extent Indians, [circulated
too widely to credibly wed the U.S]{.mark}. and ethics. [The]{.mark} raw
[force of COINTELPRO put an end to this trajectory toward a]{.mark}
possible [hegemony of ethical accountability]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Consequently, **[the power of Blackness and Redness to pose the
question---and [the power to]{.mark} [pose the question is the greatest
power of all]{.mark}---retreated as did White radicals and progressives
who "retired" from struggle. [The question's echo lies buried in the
graves of]{.mark} young [Black Panthers,]{.mark} AIM Warriors, [and
Black Liberation Army soldiers]{.mark}, or in prison cells where so many
of them have been rotting]{.underline}** (some in solitary confinement)
for ten, twenty, thirty years, and at the gates of the academy where the
"crazies" shout at passers-by**[.Gone are not only the young and vibrant
voices that affected a seismic shift on the political landscape, but
also the intellectual protocols of inquiry, and with them a spate of
feature films that became authorized, if not by an unabashed
revolutionary polemic, then certainly by a revolutionary
zeitgeist.]{.underline}**

**The Political ceded the moment black lives were in question. Even if
members in civil society work towards black emancipation in a normative
fashion. Black Death is still inscribed within society which prevents
black access to the political**

**Sexton'15**(Jared; UC- Irvine; Unbearable Blackness; Cultural

You think also, in this moment, about the unspeakable, perhaps
unimaginable ways that black lives have been devalued, and **[you have
trouble determining when to start the
story]{.underline}**---or **[historyor mythology or
fable]{.underline}**---or how far aWeld to draw your sphere of concern.
Who, after all, are your people? And, again, did or do those lives have
value in the Wrst place? Did or do they not, rather, antagonize value?
Can black lives as such be counted and counted on, in or as a form or
principle? Are they accountable or are they supernumerary? Add to that
the fact that you cannot but wonder about the sort of action that might
respond to that devaluing, or originary nonvalue, and to speculate,
indeed, about forms of value created or derived otherwise; the value of
a color, all color, or the notes of another score. The usual repertoire
won't do. And [**what of your allies, coalescing around the matter or
mattering of black lives lost or
taken**, **today**]{.underline}all **[clamoring]{.underline}**that they
are so much with you as to be you too? Which side you are on is easier
to assert than to
ascertain. **[Your]{.underline}**beautiful **[statement of a universal
particular]{.underline}**is **[turnedon]{.underline}**its head as **[the
agglutination of the world's]{.underline}**largest
particular **[universal, voiced in radical newspeak. Get out and
testify]{.underline}**, you think, **[make it plain]{.underline}**.
The **[police are marching with you now as well]{.underline}**,
expressing sympathy and solidarity with the people, your people,
and **[they are denying their terrible and terrifying social function in
the selfsame moment of execution. You are losing track of where policing
ends and protesting begins]{.underline}**. Get out and clarify, you
think, speak on it. [**Take action**. **You want to imagine a practice
in "the default of the political, in the absence of the rights of man or
the assurances of the self-possessed individual, and perhaps even
without a 'person,' in the usual meaning of the
term"**]{.underline}(Hartman, 66). You raise the ultrapolitical
possibility of a "spooky action at a distance"---think otherworldly, act
nonlocally.2 A comrade declares: "Black people in the United States and
worldwide are the only people . . . for whom it is not productive to
speak in terms of police brutality." Not because police brutality as
such is not a pervasive problem and a mortal threat, but rather because
the reigning political philosophy has been built on fundamental concepts
and categories inadequate for the analysis. "The world," or at least
that political world in which legible claims and nameable losses are
characteristic, "is not ready to think about policing in the way that it
affects black people. We are policed all the time and everywhere"
(Wilderson). You wonder what to do in a world like this. How many
dimensions does it entail? "What shape does resistance or rebellion
acquire when the force of repression is virtually without limit, when
terror resides within the limits of the socially tolerable, when the
innocuous and the insurgent meet an equal force of punishment" (Hartman,
63, emphasis added)? Innocuous or insurgent, it makes no difference[**.
You are never innocent**, **so you waste no breath pleading with a
"redeeming adjective**]{.underline}" (Kelley, 108). **[It makes you want
to throw up both your hands and holler, "Don't Shoot!"
Y]{.underline}**ou do not doubt that they will, and you halfway wish
they would, again, here and now. "Don't shoot!" or "Go on and
shoot!" **[What's the difference?3 You wish them out of existence, their

not moving, not standing, it's too much to hold up, what I really want
to say is, I don't want no **[fucking]{.underline}**country, here or
there and all the way back, I don't like it, none of it. (Brand 1997,
48) But this is not a positive program. This is a politics without claim
or name. You won't even concede that it's negative dialectics. It is
much worse than that, or much better, depending on the vantage, and the
wish. **[You do everything "with the acknowledgment that conditions will
most likely remain the same.]{.underline}**" No bullshit. **[The slogans
are for the press, and that imaginary audience you say you must
address]{.underline}**, but **[in your heart you know they aren't true,
performative contradictions all.You mask that knowledge because you
think you need allies to protect against isolation]{.underline}**,
because you think **[solidarity is always and only engendered by
coalitions, because]{.underline}**you think you
need **[friends]{.underline}**beyond those whose raised hands like
yours [**make no earthly difference**, **except to elongate the target,
because you think you have some already**]{.underline}. You need to be
reassured that y**[ou have not fallen prey to resignation or fatalism or
irresponsibility,that you have not given up on struggle as a way of
life,]{.underline}**as living. No, [**you cannot but recognize**, **if
no one else will,"the enormity of the breach instituted by
slavery"**]{.underline}(Hartman, 51). **[That breach establishes the
fundamentals of a negrophobic society]{.underline}**, an antiblack
world, and you feel it set violently against you, not as an idea, but in
your very body, your "actual being" (Fanon, 142). The breach is an
established fact for you, from the cradle to the grave, and you have
nowhere from whence to go once more unto it. You are in the breach and
of it. We all are, you say, but few listen. You are never innocent and
you realize the children must know it too. You wonder what is the
minimum age for the loss of innocence or its absence. The children know
that innocence is not **[black]{.underline}**. They never had it to
lose. And they will have occasion to learn as much, over and over again.
You **[live out a valueless form of life whose value exists as potential
in and of another world]{.underline}**, a higher-dimensional
space. **[You cannot protect yourself and you will not be
saved]{.underline}**. You will learn that lesson to the young ones and
pass it on to them as a mission or a curse. You cannot protect them with
your love or advice and no one has yet devised an art of war sufWcient
to the task. **[The hatred of the world is upon you]{.underline}**. It
is also within you. It is the substance of your waking dreams, "the
single most constant fact of \[your\] existence."4 None of which
diminishes your desire to Wght. You understand now that black lives
matter, not in or to the present order of knowledge that determines
human being, but only ever against it, outside the limits of the law.
"Black Lives Matter" is a radical will and testament. You sense in this
a displacement of the human held up between your eventful protests
against a nonhuman status and your everyday celebrations of an inhuman
excess otherwise known as black power.5

V. C ONCLUSION Throughout this essay, [I have argued that [the Politics
of hope preserve metaphysical structures that sustain black
suffering]{.mark}. This preservation amounts to an exploitation of
hope---when the Political colonizes the spiritual principle of hope and
puts it in the service of extending the "will to power" of an anti-
organization of existenc]{.underline}e. The Politics of hope, then, is
bound up with metaphysical violence, and this violence masquerades as a
"solution" to the problem of anti-blackness[. Temporal linearity,
perfection, betterment, struggle, work, and utopian futurity are
conceptual instruments of [the Political]{.mark} that [will never
obviate black suffering or anti-black violence]{.mark}; [these concepts
only serve to reproduce the conditions that render existence
unbearablefor blacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} Political theologians and
black optimists avoid the immediacy of black suffering, the horror of
anti-black pulverization, and place relief in a "not-yet-but-is
(maybe)-to-come-social order" that, itself, can do little more but
admonish blacks to survive to keep struggling. **[[Political hope
becomes a vicious and abusive cycle of struggle]{.mark}---it mirrors the
Lacanian drive, and we encircle an object (black freedom, justice,
relief, redress, equality, etc.) [that is inaccessible because it
doesn't really exist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [The political theologian
and black optimist, then, propose a collective Jouissance as an answer
to black suffering---finding the joy in struggle, the victory in toil,
and the satisfaction in inefficacious action]{.underline}. **[[We
continue to "struggle" and "work" as black youth]{.mark} are slaughtered
daily, black bodies are incarcerated as forms of capital, black infant
mortality rates are soaring, and hunger is disabling the bodies, minds,
and spirits of desperate black youth.]{.underline}** In short, these
conditions are deep metaphysical problems---the sadistic pleasure of
metaphysical domination--- and "work" and "struggle" avoid the
terrifying fact that the world depends on black death to sustain itself.
[Black nihilism attempts to break this "drive"---to stop it in its
tracks, as it were---and to end the cycle of insanity that political
hope perpetuates. The question that remains is a question often put to
the black nihilist: what is the point?]{.underline} This compulsory
geometrical structuring of thought---all knowledge must submit to, and
is reducible to, a point---it is an epistemic flicker of certainty,
determination, and, to put it bluntly, life. "[The point" exists for
life; it enlivens, enables, and sustains knowledge. Thought outside of
this mandatory point is illegible and useless.]{.underline} To write
outside of the "episteme of life" and its grammar will require a
position outside of this point, a position somewhere in the infinite
horizon of thought (perhaps this is what Heidegger wanted to do with his
reconfiguration of thought). Writing in this way is inherently
subversive and refuses the geometry of thought. [Nevertheless, the
nihilist is forced to enunciate his refusal through a "point," a point
that is contradictory and paradoxical all at once. To say that the point
of this essay is that "the point" is fraudulent---its promise of clarity
and life are inadequate--- will not satisfy the hunger of disciplining
the nihilist and insisting that one undermine the very ground upon which
one stands. Black nihilistic hermeneutics resists "the point" but is
subjected to it to have one's voice heard within the marketplace of
ideas. **The "point" of this essay is that [political hope is
pointless]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[Black suffering is an essential part
of the world, and placing hope in the very structure that sustains
metaphysical violence, the Political, will never resolve
anything]{.mark}. This is why the black nihilist speaks of "exploited
hope," and the black nihilist attempts to wrest hope from the clutches
of the Political.]{.underline} Can we think of hope outside the
Political? Must "salvation" translate into a political grammar or a
political program? The nihilist, then, hopes for the end of political
hope and its metaphysical violence. [Nihilism is not antithetical to
hope; it does not extinguish hope but reconfigures it. Hope is the
foundation of the black nihilistic hermeneutic]{.underline}. [In
"Blackness and Nothingness," Fred Moten (2013) conceptualizes blackness
as a "pathogen" to metaphysics, something that has the ability to
unravel, to disable, and to destroy anti-blackness]{.underline}. If we
read Vattimo through Moten's brilliant analysis, we can suggest that
blackness is the limit that Heidegger and Nietzsche were really after.
It is a "blackened" world that will ultimately end metaphysics, but
putting an end to metaphysics will also put an end to the world
itself---this is the nihilism that the black nihilist must theorize
through. [This is a far cry from what we call "anarchy," however. The
black nihilist has as little faith in the metaphysical reorganization of
society through anarchy than he does in traditional forms of political
existence]{.underline}. **[The black nihilist offers political apostasy
as the spiritual practice of denouncing metaphysical violence, black
suffering, and the idol of antiblackness.]{.underline}** [[The act of
renouncing will not change political structures or offer a political
program]{.mark}; instead, it is the act of retrieving the spiritual
concept of hope from the captivity of the Politica]{.underline}l.
Ultimately, [[it is impossible to end metaphysics without ending
blackness]{.mark}, and the black nihilist will never be able to withdraw
from the Political completely without a certain death-drive or
being-toward-death. This is the essence of black suffering: the lack of
reprieve from metaphysics, the tormenting complicity in the reproduction
of violence, and the lack of a coherent grammar to articulate these
dilemmas.]{.underline}

#### Ignore arguments turning black arm ownership -- the benefits outweigh any racist metaphorical impact.

Colion **Noir** 20**19** -- "Black and Armed in America" Colion Noir is
an American civil rights activist and lawyer.
<https://www.americas1stfreedom.org/articles/2019/1/25/black-and-armed-in-america/>

For me, being black and armed in America is intellectually taxing. Add
the fact that I am one of the most recognized gun rights advocates in
the country, and it can be downright exhausting.

As a black man, some people expect me to say that being armed and black
in America is dangerous. My whole life I've heard that **[[a black man
with a gun is always going to be considered a
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**. I've also carried a gun for years and
have been pulled over many times while carrying a gun with no
problems---and I have no plans of stopping.

[[Guns have done more to keep blacks safe in this country]{.mark} than
being unarmed has ever done]{.underline}.

So, do I think it is safe to be black and armed in America? In truth, I
think [it is unsafe to be black and not armed in America.]{.underline}
Guns have done more to keep blacks safe in this country than being
unarmed has ever done. I also believe that the more black people arm
themselves, the safer it will be to be black and armed.

Just consider[: Harriet Tubman carried a revolver to protect against
slave catchers and their dogs while she led black slaves to their
freedom. Black civil rights activist Robert F. Williams obtained a
charter from the National Rifle Association and set up a rifle club to
defend blacks in Jonesboro, Ark., from the Ku Klux Klan and other
attackers. The Black Panthers followed police around, armed with
firearms]{.underline} and law books to police the police. C.O. Chinn was
a black man during the civil rights era who was armed to the teeth and
provided security to the "nonviolent" sectors of the civil rights
movement. [The Deacons for Defense and Justice, an armed
African-American self-defense group, was founded in 1964 to protect
civil rights activists and their families. Black men used guns during
the Civil War to fight for their freedom. And countless black Americans
use guns every day to protect themselves, their families]{.underline}
and others they love.

[[Guns keep black people safe]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is true that,
compared to a lot of their non-black counterparts, [[gun ownership among
blacks can come with a unique set of risks]{.mark}. But]{.underline} I
believe it is important to realize that **[[these risks don't outweigh
the benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The first time I carried a concealed firearm, I experienced a wide array
of emotions. I waited a long time for my permit to come in, so I was
giddy with excitement when the wait was over. I felt empowered knowing
that I didn't need to rely on a police officer magically appearing if I
were attacked.

But I also felt anxiety. I was [a young black man with a
gun]{.underline}, and up until that point, I [had been taught that if a
cop ever realized I had a gun]{.underline} on me, [he'd more likely
think I was a criminal than a legal concealed carrier]{.underline}. As a
result, I took the painstaking effort to make sure my gun was completely
undetectable. I even learned what signs cops look for to determine if
someone was carrying a gun and made it a point not to do those things

### Alt -- Prerequisite

#### Voting negative forefronts the need to understand black suffering as a precondition for devising political strategy and forming public argument

UC Irvine, PhD in ethnic studies from UC Berkeley. "African American
Studies," *A Concise Companion to American Studies, Blackwell Companions

The latter task -- the trenchant interrogation of racial blackness
and/in the formulations of modernity and its leitmotif of freedom -- was
advanced immeasurably by Professors Lindon Barrett, Denise Ferreira da
Silva, and Ronald Judy, each in their own way. Yet, as Wilderson again
makes plain in his Red, White, and Black (2009), [the grand and anxious
question of [freedom is preceded]{.mark}, logically and [ontologically,
by a]{.mark} perhaps [more confounding question: what does it mean to
suffer?]{.mark}]{.underline} To address such a query sufficiently is to
disregard the official impatience that envelopes it. Of course, this
sentiment of expediency plays to an understandably popular urgency that
emanates from the severity of everyday life for the vast majority of
black people and the attendant status anxiety of the so-called new black
middle class. However, [[black]{.mark} creative [intellectuals have
done]{.mark} less and less talking about our pain of late and probably a
bit **[too much posturing about]{.mark} our [plans. If anything, we have
a surplus of plans!]{.mark}** What [we do not have]{.mark}]{.underline}
is [[a language]{.mark} -- much less a political culture -- [that
adequately articulates]{.mark} both the [variance and commonality of our
positions]{.mark} and our predicaments. African American Studies is
perhaps more inarticulate about the dimensions and details of black
suffering today, in an era marked by transnationalism and
multi-racialism, than it has been at any other historical juncture. I am
speaking here of [suffering]{.mark} in its fullest sense: not only [as
pain]{.mark}, which everyone experiences -- say, the pain of alienation
and exploitation -- but also as that which [blacks must bear]{.mark},
uniquely and [singularly]{.mark}, that which we must stand and stand
alone]{.underline} (see Sexton 2007). The proposal and invitation
continues: The yield of this gathering will be to assemble leading
scholars alongside emergent voices in the field of African American
Studies in order to reflect critically upon the mutual implication of a
proliferate and diverse racial formation with the living legacies of the
black radical tradition in the age of American empire. The symposium
seeks to depart from prevailing frameworks for comparative ethnic
studies -- that is, discerning how the respective experiences of blacks
and other people of color are similar or dissimilar and what have been
their historic interactions -- to consider how the matrix of
enslavement, which is to say the invention of "propertized human being"
(Harris 1993), has not only shaped myriad forms of oppression and
marginalization, but has compromised their modes of resistance and
\[their\] claims to independence as well. If there is an overarching
objective here, it is to properly illuminate what might be termed the
obscurity of black suffering, to rescue it from the murky backwaters of
persistent invisibility as well as the high-definition distortions of
glaring and fascinated light. [[Proper illumination]{.mark} is a catchy
byline]{.underline}, an instance of wishful thinking, if ever there was
one. [But [can we not speak of it]{.mark}]{.underline} more charitably,
perhaps [[as a **stratagem**]{.mark}?]{.underline} Or as a spur that
exercises the limits of our thinking? In her ground-breaking Scenes of
Subjection, Saidiya Hartman calls our attention to the ease with which
scenes of spectacular violence against the black body -- what she terms
"inaugural moment\[s\] in the formation of the enslaved" -- are
reiterated in discourses both academic and popular, "the casualness,"
she writes, "with which they are circulated, and the consequences of
this routine display of the slave's ravaged body": Rather than inciting
indignation, too often they immure us to pain by virtue of their
familiarity -- the oft-repeated or restored character of these accounts
and our distance from them are signaled by the theatrical language
usually resorted to in describing these instances -- and especially
because they reinforce the spectacular character of black suffering. \[.
. .\] At issue here is the precariousness of empathy and the uncertain
line between witness and spectator. Only more obscene than the brutality
unleashed at the whipping post is the demand that this suffering be
materialized and evidenced by the display of the tortured body or
endless recitations of the ghastly and terrible. In light of this, how
does one give expression to these outrages without exacerbating the
indifference to suffering that is the consequence of the benumbing
spectacle or contend with narcissistic identification that obliterates
the other or the prurience that too often is the response of such
displays. (Hartman 1997: 4) To put it bluntly, how does one engage with
black suffering at all without simply erasing it -- refusing it,
absorbing it, appropriating it -- in the very same gesture?
[[Hartman's]{.mark} inventive [response]{.mark}]{.underline} to what
might appear, at first glance, to be a rhetorical question or a cruel
joke (that is, making a case with evidence that is, strictly speaking,
inadmissible) [is to move away from the expected "invocations of the
shocking and the terrible" and [to look, alternately, at "scenes
in]{.mark} which terror can hardly be discerned," **"the terror of [the
mundane and quotidian]{.mark},"** what she phrases appositely as "the
**[diffusion of terror]{.mark}**."]{.underline} What she finds, if
calling it a "finding" is not immediately to betray it, is the
recapitulation -- the repetition and summation -- of this spectacular
primal scene across the entirety of the social text of racial slavery
and its aftermath. That is to say, it is never the case that this
[terror]{.underline} is not present. It [saturates the field of
encounter. It is ubiquitous and]{.underline} yet it is, perhaps for the
same reason, [barely discernible.]{.underline} One wonders thus: [how
might the discussion of this dispersed, ambient terror become any more
compelling than that which is condensed and acute? [The point being not
that blacks]{.mark} enter the wrong evidence or [pursue the wrong
argument, but rather that they are **disallowed from**]{.mark}
**entering evidence or [building arguments in the first place,]{.mark}**
[barred]{.mark}, as it were, [from]{.mark} bringing charges and [levying
claims of grievance]{.mark} or injury as such.]{.underline} [Again,
[what does it mean to suffer]{.mark}, in this way? [This
"challenge,"]{.mark} as Hartman modestly calls it, [of giving expression
to the inexpressible ]{.mark}]{.underline}is taken up again in Fred
Moten's remarkable text, In the Break. In fact, it is the discrepancy
between subjection and objection that launches the accomplishment of a
project opened and closed around the impossibility and the inevitability
of "the resistance of the object" (Moten 2003: 1). That, at least, is
how it sounds to me. What is disquieting and provocative in this
exchange is what I take to be a certain turning away from the
implications of Hartman's precarious distinction between witness and
spectator, a positional instability that is not mitigated by
transpositions in the sonic register, nor, for that matter, in the
performance arts more generally (Barrett 1999; Weheliye 2005).

## Reform

### Reforms Bad

**There are hidden expectations of black life needs to do for white life
if gains were made -**

L. Dudziak, Cold War Civil Rights: Race and the Image of American
Democracy, Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review, Volume 37
Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev. 369\]//Raunak Dua

Dudziak impressively demonstrates that Brown v. Board of Education n62
and **[the landmark civil rights legislation of the 1960s n63 were a
result of interest convergence and Cold War concerns]{.underline}**. n64
**[But these forces not only explain how the Civil Rights era came
about; they also provide insight into why the Civil Rights movement came
to an end ten years later. One corollary to the softening of domestic
attitudes exemplified by Brown and the]{.underline}** 1964 [**Civil
Rights Act was an implicit bargain in which African Americans,** [in
return for civil rights gains, were expected to demonstrate loyalty to
America and hostility to communism. They were expected to support
foreign wars and purge their ranks of overt communists.]{.mark} **n65
Dudziak\'s**]{.underline} own data suggest this implicit bargain. She
**[offers the]{.underline}** early **[examples of]{.underline}** singer
**[Josephine Baker]{.underline}** n66 **[and]{.underline}** actor-singer
**[Paul Robeson]{.underline}** n67 \[\*377**[\] to support the implicit
understanding\--if not overt warning\--that [if blacks did not support
the government, the government would take action]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
With this implicit bargain in mind, Dudziak\'s thesis can also be used
to explain some of the traumatic events of the late 1960 and early
1970s. During this period Black Power (as well as its Chicano
counterpart) appeared on the scene, challenging the role assigned to
blacks in the implicit bargain. n68 Panthers began reading and quoting
from Marx and Lenin. n69 Malcolm X called white people \"satanic\" and
America \"the devil-nation.\" n70 **[[With that bargain breaking down,
the government and other elite groups responded]{.mark} in two ways.
First, [they cracked down]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the Panthers
**[[with brutal force]{.mark}. n71 Second, [to assure that minority
leaders were indebted to the government, they instituted the War on
Poverty program]{.mark} and enlisted many minority
leaders]{.underline}**, including former militants like Denver\'s Corky
Gonzales, **[in that program, giving them]{.underline}** federal grants,
jobs, and **[patronage]{.underline}** in the form of positions they
could fill with their friends. n72 Additionally, at this time mainstream
elite groups in the private sector poured millions of dollars into the
black community. n73 **[As a result, [black economic well-being surged a
second time, but the radical thrust of the Civil Rights movement was
largely lost.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Even if their historical examples of legislature have occurred there is no way to incorporate the black body onto the national body there is an abjection that politics can't absolve and that is that of the non-human black and actually challenges an subverts the relation between subjectivity, the philosophical, and the law 

**Reeves 12**\[roger Williams , Ph.D, Assistant Professor of English and
Poetry at the University of Illinois, Chicago, Black Western Thought:
Toward a Theory of the Black Citizen-Object, 2012\] The University of
Texas at Austin dissertation paper, 2012-11-30, DTY)

[The investigation of the opacity of the black body in relationship to
the knowable, the Enlightenment's notion of the human, and the
discourses and economies of the Academy]{.underline} saturates this
project. Engaging with and yet departing from Saidiya Hartman's notion
of black as alien or foreign appendage grafted onto the state body of
the U.S. post-slavery, Karl Marx's subjunctively imagined speaking
commodity, Charles Mills's sub-personhood, Bruno Latour's nonhuman, and
Eduoard Glissant's opaque citizen, I posit that [[blackness]{.mark} and
black people [manifest a subjectivity that is akin to the]{.mark}
[subjectivity of humans.]{.mark} However, [it is not human]{.mark}. [It
is a subjectivity of objects, nonhumans]{.mark}]{.underline}, that of
the subjunctively imagined commodity. I depart from the notion that
because slavery ended black objects became black people. [[The
Emancipation Proclamation]{.underline}]{.mark} (which legal scholar
Patricia Williams calls the un-owning of slaves), amending Article 1,
Section 2 of the Constitution that declared black slaves "three-fifth of
all other persons," and [the passing of [Civil Rights Acts]{.mark} of
1866, 1875, 1964, and 1968 and so on and so on---[these legal and
juridicial acts do not absolve or remonstrate]{.mark} [the slave of the
historical, linguistic, or popular cultural representation and legacy of
their object-ness]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Saidiya Hartman notes the
negotiation of the [grafting of the alien, black object onto the
political body of the U.S. was harrowing. Concerns of social and
political hygiene---how might the disorderly, funky, reprobate,
potentially diseased black body infect the polis, the State---dominated
conversations of integrating black bodies into the country at
large.]{.underline} Though I agree with Hartman's anaylsis, I would like
to complicate it a bit by problematizing or questioning what narrative
is hierarchized and aggrandized in the narrative. I want to question how
Hartman's analysis re-inscribes the supremacy of the modern and the
Enlightenment notion of the human. I argue that Hartman's scholarly
accounting of this negotiation subsumes the discussion under the rubric
of human or the making of the human. In other words, Hartman positions
her discourse and the discourse surrounding the alien slave body to be
an investigation of a position of the human, even if not fully human.
[Hartman subordinates the nonhuman to the greater and grander narrative
of the black object becoming human; the abjection of the black object is
cleaned up via the metanarrative of tracing the evolution of the
grafting of the black body onto the "national body," thus, pushing the
exploration of the black object's ontology and epistemology to the
margins.]{.underline} Even as the technologies of biopolitical racism
are adroitly and methodically explored, they are explored via the
discourse and discursive possibilities of the human rather than via the
discourse and epistemologies of the nonhuman, the object. In my argument
for [dismantling the notion of black people as human]{.underline}, I
engage the ongoing conversation of this type of philosophical
troubling[, the troubling of subjectivity equated with personhood and
human, started by Fred Moten in In the Break: The Aesthetics of the
Black Radical Tradition]{.underline}. Moten begins with his
investigation of the anarrangements and irruptions that blackness causes
to the grammars and technologies of Western knowing in his declaration
that ["the history of [blackness is testament to the fact that objects
can and do resist]{.mark}. [Blackness]{.mark}---the extended movement of
a specific upheaval...---[is a strain that pressures the equivalence of
personhood and subjectivity]{.mark} (1). Therefore, [blacknesss]{.mark}
troubles, [resists,]{.mark} subverts, and challenges [the relationship
between the]{.mark} [legal]{.mark} [and philosophical]{.mark}
[category]{.mark} [of human]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the notion of
[subjectivity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Coupling Moten's declaration with
Bruno Latour's challenging of Enlightenment notions of modernity and the
human/nonhuman divide, I extend upon both arguments in this project
[arguing that the human never existed]{.underline}. To borrow, cite,
recite, and signify on the title of Bruno Latour's tome on the
subject---[we have never been human and we have never been
modern]{.underline}. And what does this mean for the art, poetry, and
aesthetic productions of the black citizen-object? How would these
aesthetic productions be understood, encountered, read, and interpreted,
or better yet, misunderstood, mis-encountered, mis-read, and
misinterpreted by critical apparatuses created to encounter human
aesthetic and intellectual productions? This project intervenes in this
conversation through its exploration of flexible subjectivity of black
artists and scholars like W.E.B. Dubois, Phillis Wheatley, Éduoard
Glissant, Toni Morrison, Ralph Ellison, Terrance Hayes, and Jericho
Brown, scholars and poets who negotiate subjectivity of their objectness
and the cultural, linguistic, and philosophical inheritances, archives,
and legacies of that position. This project seeks to move beyond the
recognizable discussions of double-consciousness, liminality, betwixt
and between-ness that have proliferated in conversations surrounding the
study of black literature and culture. This project plays in the dark
rather with the dark

While Warren\'s argument against the politics of hope primarily targets
its metaphysical nature, **[the destruction of black bodies that he
analyzes is no mere abstraction]{.underline}**. Neither, of course, are
the intractable racial in- equalities described by Bell. In both cases[,
**[antiblackness involves \"the literal destruction of black bodies that
provide the psychic, economic, and philosophical resources for
modernity]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to objectify, forget, and ultimately
obliterate Being]{.underline}** (nonmetaphysical Being)\" (Warren 2015,
327). This occurred initially through the transatlantic transformation
of human beings into things (slaves) and then subsequently through other
social, legal, and extralegal ways of annihilating black people and
communities, including political tactics such as poll taxes, literacy
tests, and the convict leasing system (2015, 216). **[Recent
developments in the medical health [sciences reveal]{.mark} another
material way to see how the [metaphysical, legal]{.mark}, and economic
[destruction]{.mark} of black people [via hope is both literal and
physical]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A concrete connection between hope and
poor health and death exists for black Americans, and I now turn to that
connection to bodily situate Bell\'s and Warren\'s accounts.
Psychologists and other social scientists in the United States recently
have focused on how African Americans cope with so-called mundane
racism: not the big-booted racism of chattel slavery, lynching, or even
legalized segregation, but rather the more mundane and subtle or
\'invisible\" racial attacks that increasingly are being documented in
post---Jim Crow America. Examples include the student who rolls his eyes
in class when he realizes that the black woman at the front of the room
will be his professor or the black person checking out at the grocery
store who gets hassled to show several forms of identification to cash
her check when the white person in front of her did not. In many ways,
microaggressions such as these are minor in comparison to the major
assaults that African Americans historically have experienced and still
do experience. At mini- mum, racial microaggressions are not
spectacularly horrific in the way that the overt violence of shootings
and chokeholds is. **[But just because we tend not to notice the
destructiveness of racial microaggressions does not mean they are
trivial[. Racial microaggressions can be deadly]{.mark}, although
we]{.underline}** (especially white people) **[often don\'t recognize or
want to acknowledge their violent effects.]{.underline}** De facto white
class privilege in the form of racial microaggressions contributes to
people of color\'s \"**[[racial battle fatigue]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\"
which entails \"the constant use or redirection of energy for coping
against mundane racism which **[[depletes psychological and
physiological resources needed in]{.mark} other important, creative, and
productive areas of [life]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" (Smith, Hung, and
Franklin 2012, 40). Racial battle fatigue has been **[[linked]{.mark}
empirically [to]{.mark} depression, tension, and [g]{.mark}eneralized
[a]{.mark}nxiety [d]{.mark}isorder in African Americans, and the stress
associated with all of these psychological problems also contributes to
physiological weathering that harms black health, contribut- ing to high
rates of [hypertension, cardiovascular disease, pre-term birth rates,
and infant mortality]{.mark} to name a few]{.underline}** ([Smith, Hung
and Franklin 2012, 37, 40; D. Smith 2012**). The effects of [white
racism]{.mark} literally [get inside and help constitute the bodies of
black people in harmful ways]{.mark}. They wear down the body\'s various
systems by [creating a high allostatic load via stressors that
accumulate]{.mark} over time**]{.underline}. The results are health
problems such as disproportionately high rates of pre-term birth, infant
mortality, cardio- vascular disease, diabetes, and accelerated
physiological aging (Blitstein 2009). **[Racism hurts---literally---and
it also kills in ways that are subtler but no less deadly than the
lyncher\'s noose or the neighbor\'s bullet]{.underline}** (Drexler
2007). **[[These effects]{.mark},]{.underline}** moreover, **[[can
be]{.mark} transgenerational, physiologically [passed onto]{.mark}
subsequent [generations through]{.mark} various [epigenetic
changes]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Sullivan 2013). So what can black people
do to mitigate the harmful effects of de facto white supremacy and
racial microaggressions and to ward off racial battle fatigue? As the
same study documents, the first answer is simply for them to realize the
need for coping strategies that build resilience. Black people living in
countries that formally have eliminated racial discrimination and yet
that are still informally structured by white class privilege need to
actively seek out ways to manage and resist racial battle fatigue. The
second answer is that Social support systems that, for example, provide
**[communal spaces for emotional expression and processing of
experiences of racial microaggressions were most effective in helping
African American people cope with race-related stress, as one recent
study demonstrated about African American college
students]{.underline}** (Smith, Hung, and Franklin 2012, 39). This
advice might seem rather obvious, but it turns out that **[students in
the study with high levels of hope that they could achieve their goals
in life, school, and work generally did not use active coping
strategies]{.underline}**. They tended not to seek out social support or
find venues in which they could share their experiences of white racism
with others. The explanation for this behavior is that hope on the part
of black students was empirically correlated with a sense of personal
efficacy: the more that students thought they could individually
surmount obstacles in their path, the greater their sense of hope for
the future, and vice versa. And **[[the greater their hope]{.mark} and
sense of individual efficacy, [the less]{.mark} [likely]{.mark} a person
was [to seek out communities and networks with other black
people]{.mark}]{.underline}** On the flip side, **[[low-hope
individuals]{.underline}]{.mark}** did actively seek out social support
systems. Because they did not have much hope that they could overcome
the race-based obstacles in their path, they **[tended to [seek]{.mark}
out [collective avenues for]{.mark} expressing their anger and
frustration and for taking [action against racism]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Smith, Hung, and Franklin 2012, 39). **[The upshot here is that [black
hope]{.mark} not only did not serve as an effective coping strategy for
black people, but it actually [decreased the likelihood that they would
seek]{.mark} out [coping]{.mark} strategies that were
effective]{.underline}**. This study of a mixed-gender group Of African
American college students is supported by another study focusing on
African American men, which underscores that **[hope is not always or
necessarily a healthy response to an unjust world]{.underline}**.
African American men with high to moderate levels of hope that racial
justice would prevail experienced more stress when confronted with
racial microaggressions than did African American men with low to
moderate levels of hopefulness (Smith, Hung, and Franklin 2012, 50). It
was low-hope African American men who best recognized the perva-
siveness of racist discrimination in US society and thus developed
racial socialization techniques that allowed them to keep the pernicious
effects of racism at bay long enough to develop counterstrategies to it
(2012, 50). **[[While]{.mark} some scientific [studies that do not
consider race]{.mark} have [lauded]{.mark} the [health benefits of
hope]{.mark}]{.underline}**, demonstrating how hope can help the body
reduce physical pain by triggering the release of natural analgesics
such as en- dorphins and enkephalins (Groopman 2005, 175---179), **[[we
should not]{.mark} necessarily [universalize these]{.mark} conclusions.
\"[Hope]{.mark} \[simply\] [does not have the same function in]{.mark}
the context of [African American]{.mark} men dealing with race-related
stress and racial microaggressions as it does in previously studied
contexts,]{.underline}**\" **[and thus [promoting hope]{.mark} as a way
[for black Americans]{.mark} to combat the effects of white racism [can
be counterproductive]{.mark} to racial justice]{.underline}** (Smith,
Hung, and Franklin 2012, 51). It can tear down, rather than undergird
black people by indirectly damaging their health and leading them to
neglect effective social strategies for coping with white racism.
**[These studies provide concrete support for the claim that [black hope
is not a good alternative to the despair diagnosed by West]{.mark} in
black American communities]{.underline}**. **[It does not tend to help
African Americans cope well with the insidious effects of white racism,
and [it]{.mark} even can [contribute to a decline in black people\'s
psychological and physiological health]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
While West likely is right that black communities are crucial for black
people to be able to withstand antiblack racism, it is important to
note, in accordance with the above studies, that those communities that
helped mitigate the harmful physiological effects of antiblack racism
were not particularly based on hoping. They instead were based on
coping. They were collective outlets for sharing experiences of and
venting frustration about stressful racial encounters, for example,
which is not the same thing as generating hope that antiblack racism can
be eliminated. What might black communities that cope look like? For
starters, \"coping\" as used here does not mean surtendering, selling
out, or merely getting by. **[Communities that cope would be communities
that recognize that \"nothing has worked\" against antiblack racism and
that black people \"have exhausted the discourses of humanism and the
strategies of equality\"]{.underline}** (Warren 2015, 228). **[I want to
underscore the pragmatic significance of this recognition.
[Pragmatically understood,]{.mark} the value of things is found in their
effects]{.underline}**---including the ultimate effect of whether they
enable flourishing (Sullivan 2001) **[and the effect of humanism hasn\'t
been the flourishing of black people. Pursuing strategies of racial
equality hasn\'t worked]{.underline}**. **[These realizations are
important for the effects they can have: they allow a very different set
of strategies in relationship to antiblack racism to emerge. Rather than
defeatist, [letting go of]{.mark} the goal of [racial equality can
be]{.mark} liberating and [invigorating for]{.mark} black
people]{.underline}**. **[It can free them up to envision [new
goals]{.mark}, to develop new truths about how best to respond to
racism, and thus to stop banging their heads against a wall that will
not budge]{.underline}**. \"Casting off the equality ideology,\" Bell
urges, \"will lift the sights\.... From this broadened perspective on
events and problems, \[black people\] can better appreciate and cope
with racial subordination\" (1992b, 378). For example, Bell claims that
rather than spend energy and time trying to fully integrate American
schools---which still has not happened sixty years after Brown v. Board
of Education and has been reversed in some major cities (see, e.g.,
Michelson, Smith, and Nelson people should work on raising money for and
strengthening all-black schools (1992a, 63). More generally, racial
realism would urge that black people devise strategies that acknowledge
the \"white self-interest principle\": white people will never do
anything to improve the lives of black people unless it first and
foremost benefits themselves as well, particularly economically (Bell
1992a, 54). In many ways, then, successfully fighting white racism is a
very crude, nonsophisticated business. It isn\'t about devising fancy
moral arguments or ideal forms of jurisprudence; it instead involves
\"making a shameless appeal to the predictable self-interest of whites\"
and their wallets (1992a, 107). One could add that it also relies on the
predictable self-delusion, self- grandeur, and racial ignorance of white
people. Bell (1992a, 62) argues that **[black people---both individuals
and communities---need to be like Brer Rabbit of the Uncle Remus
stories]{.underline}**, [who tricks Brer Fox into setting him free by
convincing Brer Fox that throwing Brer Rabbit into the briar patch is
the worst thing that Brer Fox could ever do to him.]{.underline} Brer
Fox acts in what he thinks is his own best interest---an interest in
harming Brer Rabbit by keeping him captive---and in so doing, he does
the very thing that enables Brer Rabbit to escape. A masterful tactician
at manipulating the canine ignorance and solipsistic focus of Brer Fox,
**[Brer Rabbit doesn\'t rely on rational argumentation, nor does he
depend on the law]{.underline}** or any universal rights of animal kind
to obtain his freedom. **[He instead is ruthlessly realistic about the
malicious self-interest that motivates Brer Fox, and for that
reason]{.underline}** he **[is able to devise an effective strategy for
getting out of his clutches.]{.underline}** Brer Rabbit doesn\'t succeed
in making any sort of large-scale or structural change in the
relationship between foxes and rabbits, nor does he particularly hope
to. He instead focuses practically on how to save his life in the midst
of a particular struggle with Brer Fox, and through his struggle, he is
able to flourish even if the overarching tyranny of foxes has not been
eliminated. Because struggle is central to racial realism, racial
realism is neither passive nor apathetic. It is not nihilist in the
sense that West uses the term. But neither is it hopeful. Even though
they might bear a superficial similar- ity, the struggle involved in
racial realism isn\'t the same struggle encour- aged by West\'s politics
of hope. [[The struggle of]{.underline} **[political hope
is]{.underline}** [for the **fantastical** object of a future without
antiblack racism. It insists that \"legitimate action takes place in the
political\" and that \"a refusal to \'do poli- tics\" is equivalent to
\'doing nothing\']{.underline}]{.mark} [\"]{.underline}
([Warren]{.underline} 2015, 223). The struggle of racial realism, in
contrast, doesn\'t involve believing that the right thing will win out.
Bell\'s racial realism invokes a different kind of existentialism than
that of West, appealing to Camus (Bell 1992a, x). As Camus\'s main
character from The Plague (1991) understands, one resists and must
resist the plague---whether in the form of mass death, the Nazi
Holocaust, or in this case white class privilege and white
supremacy---even though, or per- haps precisely because, one cannot
conquer it. [There is no ultimate progress or victory to anticipate, no
matter whether human struggle is assisted by the divine. [The
plague]{.mark} might be beaten back for a while, but it **[always will
return]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Fighting it is absurd if the goal of the
fight is to eliminate it. On Camus\'s view, one fights the plague for
different reasons, ones that have to do with affirming the dignity and
value of humanity. Likewise, on Bell\'s view, [black
people\'s]{.underline} \"[struggle for freedom]{.underline}, is bottom,
a manifestation of our humanity that [survives]{.underline} [and grows
stronger through resistance to oppression, even if that oppression is
never overcome]{.underline}\" (1992b, 378). If this is a kind of
humanism, it is absurd rather than progressive.

#### Racial equality under the law is not only impossible but the attempts to re-create and shift the puzzle pieces of civil society mean slavery is reinvented in different ways

Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton, in then influential Black
Power, describe [reformist strategies as \"[playing ball\" with the
white man]{.mark}. They argue that reform plays the white man\'s game in
order to gain rights, [i.e. appeal to a white supremacist
government]{.mark} that is [the]{.mark} precise [agent]{.mark}
[responsible for the]{.mark} original [harms]{.mark} they are seeking to
alleviate]{.underline}.9 While this may very well result in the granting
of new rights previously denied, [it [maintains a hierarchical system
between whites and nonwhites]{.mark},]{.underline} since the latter will
have to continue to appeal to the former to ask for rights they never
should have been denied in the first place. [This places the former in a
position of power to accept or deny such requests]{.underline}. Thus, in
Carmichael and Hamilton\'s view, attempting to resist white supremacy
[by [working within]{.mark} white supremacist [institutions maintains a
dangerous system of power]{.mark} relations that lock in place the
hierarchy between whites and nonwhites]{.underline}. / It is unfortunate
enough that members of minority groups face public and private racial
discrimination. It is worse, however, to place the burden of combating
this discrimination on them. What Carmichael and Hamilton aptly point
out is that the hierarchy between races mentioned above is what is
responsible for this undue burden. There is not only the constant
physical struggle of protesting, writing letters, and being dragged
through litigation that can often get expensive, but there is the
psychological struggle as well. [Why am I not worthy of equal protection
under the law? Why is it that others do not even notice the disparate
impact of the law? Or, even worse, [why is it that those who do notice,
seem to not care?]{.mark}]{.underline} / [[What]{.mark} inevitably
[comes]{.mark} [with]{.mark} these types of [reformist strategies is an
emotional struggle]{.mark}, namely, an inferiority complex that makes
the victimized individual stop and wonder --- who put the white man in
charge of my body]{.underline}? **[[Appeals to]{.mark} the federal
government to [repeal]{.mark} [discriminatory]{.mark} [acts]{.mark} that
deny minorities rights [becomes]{.mark} [analogous to asking whites to
eliminate such policies and]{.mark} to [allow]{.mark} [others]{.mark}
[access to the same rights they enjoy every day]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The racial state becomes in charge of what nonwhites can and cannot do,
and when nonwhites continue to go to whites asking them to pass certain
policies, nonwhites further legitimate this system of power relations.
It is difficult to see how true equality can be achieved wider such a
system. / B. Missing the Root Cause: The Racial State / Omi and Winant
further support this claim and explain that **[[it is not]{.mark} merely
[individual policies]{.mark} passed by the United States federal
government [that are racist]{.mark}, [but that racial oppression is a
structure of the government itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}**10 They
describe this structure as the \"racial state\" to show that [the state
does not merely support racism, but rather, it supports the concept of
race itself.]{.underline} As will be discussed later in this paper, Omi
and Winant explain how the state is the agent that has defined race, and
that this definition has evolved over time, to maintain the concept of
race and support racism. / Given the existence of the racial state, Omi
and Winant critique [[reformist strategies]{.mark} as [fall]{.mark}ing
[short of]{.mark} achieving normative goals of [eliminating
racism]{.mark} since the reforms merely get
re-equilibriated]{.underline}. A look at the history of racial victories
in the United States further supports this critique. Racial victories
for one minority were often made possible only with the entrapment of
another racial minority. For example, while many celebrate the racial
victory of the 1954 Brown v. Board decision, many fail to see this
happened the same year as Operation Wetback, which shifted the racial
discrimination to a different population, removing close to one million
illegal immigrants, mostly Mexicans, from the United States.11 Moreover,
soon after the ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
granting citizenship and suffrage to Blacks. Congress chose to deny
citizenship to Chinese immigrants.12 In 1941, shortly after the
establishment of the Committee on Fair Employment Practices permitted
Blacks into defense industries, Japanese Americans were taken from their
homes and sent off to internment camps. Pei-te Lien argues that **[all
of these \"coincidences\" support critiques of reformist strategies that
merely target individual policies, since [without]{.mark}
[challenging]{.mark} [the]{.mark} racial [state]{.mark} as a whole,
[even the elimination of these]{.mark} individual [policies will
fail]{.mark} [to eliminate racism]{.mark}, as [they]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} simply [replicate]{.mark} [themselves or shift
elsewhere]{.mark} and target racial minorities in different
ways.1]{.underline}**4 / C. Separatist Movements / This helps to explain
why political activists began adopting other more revolutionary
strategies. Contrary to Martin Luther King Jr. and many of his followers
during the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Power Movement emerged and
began advocating for more separatist strategies that rejected making
reformist appeals to the United States federal government. In his speech
\"The Ballot or the Bullet,\" Malcolm X argued: / When you take your
case to Washington D.C., you\'re taking it to the criminal who\'s
responsible: it\'s like miming from the wolf to the fox. They\'re all in
cahoots together. They all work political chicanery and make you look
like a chump before the eyes of the world. Here you are walking around
in America, getting ready to be drafted and sent abroad, like a tin
soldier, and when you get over there, people ask you what you are
fighting for, and you have to stick your tongue in your cheek. No, [take
Uncle Sam to court, take him before the world.]{.underline} / Critics of
reformist strategies, such as Malcolm X, understood the **[United States
as being inherently racial and [thus incapable of
reform]{.mark}.]{.underline}** They use the \"coincidences\" listed
above as evidence to support this claim. They view the United States
federal government as a racial state that will merely continue to define
race in new and more modernized ways, ensuring the permanence of racism
with the passage of new policies supporting these definitions. This is
why they believe re[formists are wrong to attack individual policies,
rather than the racial state itself.]{.underline} / For example, the
legal enforcement of a racially discriminatory housing covenant may have
been justified due to a racist belief that members of the minority race
restricted from acquiring title within that neighborhood is inferior to
the Caucasian race. More specifically, one might support said covenant
because one believes the inferiority of that minority race and the
potential they might become your neighbor will result in a decrease in
the fair market value of your property. After vigorous ongoing protests
from civil rights activists, that particular law enforcing those
covenants might get repealed. However, the reason for the repeal of that
law might arise not from an ethical epiphany, but rather an economic
rationale in which the homeowner is shown his property value will remain
unaffected, or perhaps even increase. Thus, that particular act may get
repealed, but the policymakers responsible for its original draft will
still be in power, and will maintain the same beliefs that motivated
that piece of legislation in the first place. Because there has been no
ethical realization of the injustice in their conduct, the chances
remain high that they will construct new, apparently different but
equally discriminatory policies that will force activists to join forces
once again and continue the same fight. / This is why it is not the
individual policies, but [the government itself that is the \"preeminent
site of racial conflict]{.underline}.\"17 Omi and Winant\'s proposal of
the \"racial state\" views the government as \"inherently racial,\"
meaning it does not simply intervene in racial conflicts, but it is the
locus of racial conflict.18 In addition to structuring conceptions of
race, the government in the United States is in and of itself racially
structured.19 State policies govern racial politics, heavily influencing
the public on how race should be viewed. The ways in which it does so
changes over time, often taking on a more invisible nature. For example,
Omi and Winant describe the racial state as treating race in different
ways throughout different periods of time, first as a biologically based
essence, and then as an ideology, etc. These policies are followed by
racial remedies offered by government institutions, in response to
political pressures and in accordance to these different treatments of
race, varying in degree depending on the magnitude of the threats those
pressures pose to the order of society. [Notable achievements during the
[Civil Rights Movement have served as a double-edged sword.]{.mark}
While the reformist strategies utilized during that period helped make
certain advances possible, [it]{.mark} also [drove]{.mark} other [more
overt expressions of racism underground]{.mark}.]{.underline} These more
invisible instantiations of racial injustice are far more difficult to
identify than its previously more explicit forms. Praising these
victories risks giving off the illusion that the fight is over and that
racism is a description of the past. / For example, the ratification of
the Fifteenth Amendment gave off the illusion that all citizens
thereafter had equal access to the right to vote. Those who supported
its ratification now felt entitled to the moral credentials necessary to
legitimize their ability to express racially prejudiced attitudes.21 For
example, voter turnout today remains relatively low for Asian-Americans,
and many blame this on cultural differences between Asians and
Americans.22 Asian-Americans are labeled as apathetic in the political
community and they themselves have been attributed the blame for
relatively low representation of Asian-Americans in the government
today.23 This however, ignores the way in which other more invisible
practices serve to obstruct Asian-Americans from being able to exercise
their right to vote. / Research by the United States Election Assistance
Commission by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University,
for example, indicates that restrictive voter identification
requirements have effectively served to disenfranchise Asian Pacific
Islanders (APIs) from voting.24 In the 2004 election, researchers found
APIs in states where voters were required to present proper
identification at the polls were 8.5% less likely to vote.25 This study
confirmed that voter ID requirements prevented a large number of APIs
from voting.26 / Voter suppression tactics also play a large role in the
disenfranchisement of APIs. According to a Voter Intimidation and Vote
Suppression briefing paper by Demos, a national public policy center, an
estimated 50 Asian Americans were selectively challenged at the polls in
Alabama during August of 2004, as being ineligible to vote due to
insufficient English-speaking skills.27 Many states have allowed this
selective challenging of voters to take place at the polls, resulting in
a feeling of fear, intimidation, and embarrassment among APIs, driving
them away from the polls. / The danger in treasuring monumental
victories such as the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment becomes
apparent when people interpret this ratification as an indication that
voting discrimination is no longer a problem, and that if the voter
turnout of Asian-Americans is consistently low, it must be because they
are politically apathetic or disinterested in American ideals. Because
they originally supported the ratification of the amendment, whites can
now feel as if they have the moral credentials to make conclusions such
as the cultural differences rationale. The same can be seen after courts
ordered the desegregation of public schools and [after affirmative
action programs became more widespread. [People]{.mark} began
[assum]{.mark}ing [African-Americans]{.mark} now [had an equal
opportunity for education]{.mark} and that if they did not succeed, it
must be a reflection of their intelligence or work-ethic, failing to see
the ways the problem has not been solved,]{.underline} but rather
disguised itself in other costumes, such as tracking programs in schools
or teachers who view their presence as merely \"affirmative action
babies\" and expect them to fail. / One might ask, then, why can we not
change the racial state one policy at a time? Perhaps one could first
work to gain the right to vote, and then move on to combat
discriminatory identification requirements and political scare tactics.
It would not seem entirely implausible to assume that the success of
individual piecemeal reforms within the government could eventually
result in a transformation of the institution itself. However, simply
eliminating discriminatory policies is insufficient for an overhaul of a
racial institution. / Understanding the motivating reasons for the
elimination of individual racist policies is a critical factor in
determining the success of a movement. While one justification for
passing the Fifteenth Amendment might consist of arguments in favor of
equality and exposing racial injustice, another justification might
involve maintaining order and minimizing disruption, which is important
to the federal government and its ability to run smoothly. Thus, the
government often seeks out ways to normalize society through eliminating
disruptions to preserve order. When those being denied certain rights
grow significantly discontent, they rebel and become disruptions to the
functioning of white, civil society. This can take the form of civil
disobedience, such as protests, peaceful demonstrations, petitions,
letters to the government, etc., or more revolutionary measures, such as
damaging government offices or violently harassing officials to
acknowledge the injustices and change policy. / All of these measures,
however peaceful or violent, disrupt society. A town cannot run smoothly
if protesters are filling up the streets or blocking frequently-used
road paths, and most certainly cannot run smoothly if town halls are
being lit on fire. Thus, in order to return to the desired homeostasis,
those in power may often compromise and offer to rectify the situation
at hand by granting rights to individuals through changes in legislation
in order to appease them and \"eliminate\" the disruption (the protests,
demonstrations, etc.). The lack of effort made towards protecting these
rights bolsters Bell\'s argument that these reforms serve more of a
symbolic value rather than functional. If [still operating under the
racial state, these piecemeal reforms will fail to solve the original
racial injustices in the long term, as they will only succeed in
establishing a new unstable equilibrium]{.underline}, only to be
followed with the replication of new racial problems.28 These new
problems will once again create resentment, generate protest, and the
cycle will begin to replicate itself, ensuring the permanence of racism.
Omi and Winant term this cycle of continuous disruption and restoration
of order as the trajectory of racial politics.29 This trajectory
supports the treatment of racism as inevitable since even if the racial
state mitigates racial disruption over a particular policy and
\"restores order,\" another policy based off a new definition of race
will emerge triggering another racial disruption, continuing this cycle
of racial politics

Karena Shaw (2002) and Sankaran Krishna (2001), amongst others, discuss
the ways in which the nation-state and sovereignty determine these
inclusions and exclusions. Shaw examines the constitution and
legitimation of disciplinary authority in IR by focusing on the
exclusion of indigenous peoples from IR. For Shaw, the "[preconditions
established by the assumption of sovereignty as the grounds of
analyses]{.underline}" in IR "[provides the basic tension that any
attempt to include indigenous peoples in disciplinary conversations must
negotiate]{.underline}" (Shaw 2002:64). Acknowledging that the focus on
sovereignty excludes yet to be decolonized indigenous peoples from the
disciplinary boundaries, she also suggests that the efforts of scholars
such as Franke Wilmer (1993) and Neta Crawford (1994) to seek inclusion
of native voices in IR based on the terms of sovereignty limit their
analysis. According to Shaw, **[[Wilmer\'s analysis]{.mark} on how

]{.mark}]{.underline}****[[does not take into account the fact that
indigenous peoples "have not been incidental frills at the edges of but
have always been central to IR]{.mark}---both as a discipline and as
practices of politics among nations"]{.underline}** (Shaw 2002:68). For
example, Shaw suggests that [the role of international law, primarily
through the doctrine of terra nullius, in the violence and
dispossessions enacted upon indigenous peoples remind us of how
racialized difference was used in the theft of land and to deny
sovereignty to indigenous nations]{.underline}. In addition, she reminds
us that "the active marginalization of indigenous peoples has been
necessary for IR to appear and function" (Shaw 2002:68).

### AT: Gordon -- Not Ontological

#### We'll impact turn Gordon - Gordon's work is based in Sartre's existentialism which only applies to the human and the idea of "bad faith" relies on the very metaphysics that destroy black flesh

**Warren 18** (Calvin, an Assistant Professor in WGSS. He received his
B.A. in Rhetoric/Philosophy (College Scholar) from Cornell University
and his MA and Ph.D. in African American/American Studies from Yale
University, "Ontological Terror; Blackness, Nihilism, and
Emancipation")//Elmer

I would also point [[this criticism]{.mark} to Jean-Paul Sartre's
celebration of nothing in Being and Nothingness]{.underline}: An Essay
on Phenomenological Ontology. [His exis¬ tentialism]{.underline}
critiques the transcendental ground of human nature and the re¬
stricting teleology this ground engenders by [[argu]{.mark}ing [that
there is nothing]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(no ultimate ground
outside the self); [[therefore]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[we can
choose,]{.underline} [out of this nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}[¬
[ness]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the form our lives will
take]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Ultimately, [his existentialism]{.mark} uses
this noth¬ ingness to [place ultimate responsibility for one's life on
the individual]{.mark} (on this subject).]{.underline} Thus a Sartrean
existentialism would celebrate nothing/nothingness as the occasion for
productive action and transformation. [I cannot disagree with this
celebration]{.underline} more strongly, [since]{.underline}, in my
opinion, [[it assumes a transcendental ontology of a human capable of
transforming nothing into a productive something]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[This is not the case for black being]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For
black nihilism, nothing restricts human freedom with a terror it
attempts to control and project onto black being. [Put differently, if
nothing [for Sartre enables the celebration of agency]{.mark} and
choice, [it is only because the terror of nothing is first projected
onto black bodies]{.mark} in a metaphysical world]{.underline}. The
rejoinder that my position is bad faith relies on the very metaphysics
(or philosophical anthropology) that destroys the flesh. Put
differently, [[without the flesh]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[one cannot act
authenti¬ cally]{.underline}]{.mark} or [[experience radical
freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}, since the ground of the human is absent.
Sartrean existentialism only applies to the human subject (embodies
flesh) in a metaphysical world[[. This critique carries over into the
important work of black existentialism and its reliance on Sartrean
ontology.]{.underline}]{.mark} Black nihilism and black existentialism,
then, although agreeing on the viciousness of antiblack racism, would
part ways as they concern philosophical anthropology, since humanity is
not the ground of black being, and this ground is necessary for a
celebration of nothing and a rejection of bad faith; [see **Lewis
Gordon's** **groundbreaking work Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism

analysis ofthe living dead), and Sartre's Being and

IV\. A Foundation for Renewed Racial Dialogue A deepened appreciation
and open acknowledgment of this pedigree is crucial to restoring public
conversation on race preferences. Opponents of race preferences must
come to understand that this pedigree, if left unaddressed, tends to
overwhelm the underlying merit of arguments against race preferences in
the eyes of proponents. At the same time, proponents should understand
that the deployment of these pedigreed rhetorical themes does not
necessarily signal agreement with the nineteenth-century racial norms
from which they are sourced. For both proponents and opponents, [the
[avoidance of]{.mark} a rapid retreat into **[ideological trench
warfare]{.mark}** not only [preserves space for **reasoned, substantive
debate**]{.mark}]{.underline} regarding race preferences, [[but also
allows for]{.mark} the possibility of]{.underline} overcoming our
collective fixation on race preferences as the issue in American race
relations and [**[advancing the conversation]{.mark}** to reach the
larger issue of producing a more racially inclusive
society]{.underline}. [Our failing public conversation on race matters
not only presents a particularly tragic moment in American race
relations, but also evinces a greater failure of democracy.
[**Sustained, meaningful dialogue** is]{.mark} a [critical]{.mark}, if
not indispensable feature of our liberal democracy]{.underline}. n260
[[It is through]{.underline}]{.mark} \[\*1312\] [meaningful [public
conversation about **what actions government should take (or refrain
from taking)** that public policy]{.mark} determinations ultimately
[gain legitimacy]{.mark}. Conversation is particularly important in our
democracy, given the profoundly diverse and often contradictory cultural
and political traditions that are the sine qua non of American life.
Under these particular circumstances, \"[persons ought to]{.mark} strive
to [engage in a mutual process of **critical interaction**]{.mark},
because [if they do not, no]{.mark} uncoerced common [understanding
can]{.mark} possibly [be attained]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} n261 Sincere
deliberation, in its broadest idealized form, ensures that a broad array
of input is heard and considered, legitimizing the resulting decision.
Under this view, \"if the preferences that determine the results of
democratic procedures are unreflective or ignorant, then they lose their
claim to political authority over us.\" n262 In the absence of
self-conscious, reflective dialogue, \"democracy loses its capacity to
generate legitimate political power.\" n263 [In addition to legitimizing
the exercise of state authority in a liberal democracy, dialogue works
to promote individual freedom. [The power to hash over our alternatives
is]{.mark} **an [important]{.mark} exercise of human
agency**]{.underline}. n264 [If democracy is taken to mean rule by the
people themselves, then conversation and deliberation are the principal
means through which we declare and assert the power to shape our own
belief systems]{.underline}. The roots of this idea of dialogue as
freedom-promoting are traceable to the Kantian view that individual
motivation that is either uncriticized or uncontested can be understood
on a deeper level as a mode of subjugation. As Frank Michelman explains,
\"in Kantian terms we are free only insofar as we are self-governing,
directing our actions in accordance with law-like reasons \[\*1313\]
that we adopt for ourselves, as proper to ourselves, upon conscious,
critical reflection on our identities (or natures) and social
situations.\" n265 Because \"self-cognition and ensuing self-legislation
must, to a like extent, be socially situated,\" Michelman continues,
\"norms must be formed through public dialogue and expressed as public
law.\" n266 In this way, [[dialogue]{.mark} as democratic modus operandi
[can be understood]{.mark} both [as **a material expression of freedom**
and]{.mark} as **[a mechanism to promote]{.mark} [individual
freedom]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Robust [dialogue on **public
policy matters**]{.mark} also [promotes]{.mark} the individual
[growth]{.mark} of the dialogue participants. [Conversation helps people
become **more knowledgeable**]{.mark} and hold **better developed
opinions** because [\"opinions can be **tested**]{.mark} and
**enlarged** [only where there is]{.mark} a **genuine [encounter with
differing opinions]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} n267 Moreover, meaningful
conversation serves to broaden people\'s moral perspectives to include
matters of public good, because appeals to the public good are often the
most persuasive arguments available in public deliberation. n268 Indeed,
even if people are thinking self-interested thoughts while making public
good arguments, cognitive dissonance will create an incentive for such
individuals to reconcile their self interest with the public good. n269
At the same time, [because [political dialogue is a **material
manifestation** of democracy]{.mark} in action, it promotes a feeling of
**democratic community** and instills in the people a will for political
action to advance **reasoned public policy** in the spirit of promoting
the public good]{.underline}. n270 [For these reasons, the collective
aspiration of [those interested in pursing **serious**, **sustained**,
and **policy-legitimating dialogue** on race]{.mark} matters
[must]{.mark} be to [cultivate a **reasoned discourse**]{.mark} that is
relatively free of retrograde ideological baggage that feeds
**skepticism**, engenders **distrust**, and effectively **forecloses
constructive conversation** on the most corrosive and divisive issue in
American history and contemporary life]{.underline}. As the forgoing
sections suggest, the continued reliance upon pedigreed rhetorical
themes has and continues to poison racial legal discourse. Given the
various normative and ideological commitments that might be ascribed to
\[\*1314\] opponents of race preferences, the question thus becomes, how
are we to approach the task of breaking through the conversational
impasse and creating intellectual space for meaningful discourse on this
issue? One can imagine at least three responses to this question. As an
initial matter, one might subscribe to the view that pedigree is not
destiny, and thus conclude that the family resemblance tells us little,
if anything, definitive about the normative commitments of today\'s
opponents of race preferences. Consider the argument that the benefits
of white privilege do not extend equally among all whites, and that
policies that treat all whites as equally guilty of racial subordination
advance a theory of undesirable rough justice. n271 Although this
argument is a staple of modern opponents of race preferences, it would
be a mistake to conclude that it can only be deployed by those persons
who normatively oppose race preferences. Indeed, one might very well
support race preferences, but believe quite strongly that such programs
should be particularly sensitive to individual candidate qualifications.
Similarly, although one might believe that diversity does not comport
with merit based decisionmaking in education and employment, it would be
incorrect to interpret this belief as necessarily indicative of a
greater commitment to preserving status quo racial inequality. One might
reject the diversity rational as insufficient to justify a system of
race preferences that one strongly believes must be justified. In short,
one may be inclined to simply engage the argument and ignore the
possibility of retrograde normative underpinnings. Interestingly, a
small cadre of scholars has adopted this approach. Derrick Bok and
William Bowen, in The Shape of the River, investigated whether racial
minorities feel stigmatized or otherwise adversely affected as a result
of being denoted beneficiaries of affirmative action policy in college
admissions. n272 Thomas Ross has critically examined claims of
collective white innocence. n273 More recently, Goodwin Lui has
researched the scope of the burden that affirmative action in college
admissions imposes upon aspiring white students. n274 In each instance,
these scholars chose to place to one side their skepticism about the
normative commitments of those advancing the viewpoint, and launch
directly into substantive critiques of that viewpoint. \[\*1315\] This
approach, however, may prove unsatisfactory for those more strongly
committed to racial justice - those for whom it is not enough to simply
challenge ideas in the abstract. As the late Robert Cover famously
wrote, \"legal interpretation takes place within a field of pain and
death.\" n275 By this, he meant that the stakes of legal discourse are
elevated when bodies are on the line. A vigorous critique of the
substantive position alone leaves the normative underpinnings - the
motivational force behind the proposal - dangerously intact. It may
stymie the particular vehicle that attempts to reinforce racial
subordination, but it leaves unaddressed the fundamental motive driving
policy positions that seek to undermine racial minorities in the first
place. At the other end of the responsive spectrum is [wholesale
[rejection]{.mark}]{.underline}. One might view the pedigree as
providing good reason to dismiss opponents of race entirely. Proponents
of this view may choose to indulge fully this liberal skepticism and
simply reject the message along with the messenger. n276 The tradition
of legal discourse on American race relations \[\*1316\] has been one
steeped in racial animus and characterized by circumlocution,
evasiveness, reluctance and denial. When opponents avail themselves of
rhetorical strategies used by nineteenth-century legal elites, they
necessarily invoke the specter of this tragic racial past. Moreover,
their continued reliance upon pedigreed rhetoric to justify a system
that only modestly responds to persistent racial disparities in the
material lives of racial minorities suggests a deep, unarticulated
normative commitment to preserving the racial status quo in which whites
remain comfortably above blacks. The steadfast reliance upon pedigreed
rhetoric, coupled with the apparent disconnect between claims of racial
egalitarianism and material conditions of racial subordination as a
result of persistent racial disparities, spoils the credibility of
modern opponents of race preferences and creates an incentive for
proponents to dismiss them without serious interrogation, consideration,
and weighing of the arguments they advance. The principal deficit of
this approach is that it [[would serve only to **concretize the existing
conversational impasse** and subvert]{.mark} the larger aspiration of
seeking **[constructive solutions to]{.mark} pressing [racial
issues]{.mark}**. [It creates]{.mark} an incentive to view [race]{.mark}
matters [in **purely ideological terms** and]{.mark} further subverts
the possibility of **reasoned policy debate**. Speaking of race matters
in purely ideological terms [poses a **serious impediment** to]{.mark}
racial [conversation]{.mark}]{.underline} because, in advancing one\'s
position, one essentially argues that a particular set of circumstances
demands a particular outcome. In this \[\*1317\] way, purely ideological
race rhetoric functions much like philosopher Immanuel Kant described in
the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. n277 According to Kant, a
moral imperative is categorical insofar as it is presented as
objectively necessary, without reference to some purpose or outcome. The
imperative is the end in and of itself. As Kant explained, the moral
imperative \"has to do not with the matter of the action and what is to
result from it, but with the form and the principle from which the
action itself follows; and the essentially \[sic\] good in the action
consists in the disposition, let the result be what it may.\" n278
Because the moral imperative embodies that which is morally good, it
necessarily makes a claim about justice. In short, an act is deemed
morally just to the extent that it retains fidelity to the moral
imperative. [By contrast, a [policy argument reflects a set of
choices]{.mark} or priorities and asserts a claim [about the impact of
**a particular set of decisions**]{.mark} upon the world]{.underline}.
n279 A policy argument does not embody a claim to justice. Indeed, the
correctness of a policy choice is often tested against the backdrop of
some agreed upon conception of justice. As the late Jerome Culp, Jr.
explained: Neither side of a moral debate is likely to be persuaded by
proof that the policy claims support or discredit their moral positions.
Policy arguments can be disproved by empirical evidence and challenged
by showing in some situations the policy does not work or has contrary
results. To refute a moral claim, however, first requires some agreement
on the moral framework. Only then can one discuss whether the moral
policy advocated conforms to the agreed-upon framework. n280 Speaking
about race matters in purely ideological or moral terms creates the
impression that a particular racial policy is rooted in some theory of
what is morally just. In this way, opposition to race preferences is
made to appear \"above the fray\" of politics and less susceptible to
public choice debate. In addition, it enables opponents to claim that
race \[\*1318\] preferences merely reflect the political whims of its
proponents, unanchored by principle or a coherent theory of social
justice. Second, [[reducing conversation on race]{.mark} matters [to an
ideological contest allows opponents to **elide inquiry** into
whether]{.mark} the results of [a **particular**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}preference [[**policy** are desirable. Policy positions]{.mark}
masquerading [as principled ideological stances create the impression
that a racial policy is]{.mark} not simply a choice among available
alternatives, but [the embodiment of some higher moral]{.mark}
principle. Thus, [the \"principle\" becomes **an end in itself**,
without reference to **outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Consider the prevailing view of colorblindness in constitutional
discourse. Colorblindness has come to be understood as the embodiment of
what is morally just, independent of its actual effect upon the lives of
racial minorities. This explains Justice Thomas\'s belief in the \"moral
and constitutional equivalence\" between Jim Crow laws and race
preferences, and his tragic assertion that \"Government cannot make us
equal \[but\] can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal
before the law.\" n281 For Thomas, there is no meaningful difference
between laws designed to entrench racial subordination and those
designed to alleviate conditions of oppression. Critics may point out
that colorblindness in practice has the effect of entrenching existing
racial disparities in health, wealth, and society. But [in [framing the
debate in **purely ideological terms**, opponents]{.mark} are able to
[avoid the]{.mark} contentious [issue of **outcomes**]{.mark} and make
viability determinations based exclusively on whether racially
progressive measures exude fidelity to the ideological principle of
colorblindness. [**Meaningful policy debate** is replaced by ideological
exchange, which **further exacerbates hostilities** and **deepens the
cycle of resentment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. n282

#### Reformation is a prerequisite to revolution---focus on instantaneous individual action/rhetoric results in wide spread backlash, failed organization, and re-entrenchment of right-wing domination. Building alliances are necessary

Saul **ALINSKY**, community organizer and writer, 19**71** \[*Rules for
Radicals*, p. xix-xxiii (Gender Modified -- Sigalos)\]

As an organizer I [start from **where the world is**, as it is, not as I
would like it to be]{.underline}. That we accept the world as it is does
not in any sense weaken our desire \'to change it into what we believe
it should be-[[it is necessary to begin where the world is if we are
going to change it]{.mark} to what we think it should be. [That means
**working in the system**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There\'s another reason
for working inside the system. Dostoevski said that taking a new step is
what people fear most. [Any revolutionary change must be preceded by a
passive]{.underline}, affirmative, [non-challenging attitude toward
change among the mass of our people. They must feel so frustrated, so
defeated, so lost, so futureless in the prevailing system that they are
willing to let go of the past and chance the future]{.underline}. This
acceptance is the reformation essential to any revolution. [[To bring on
this]{.mark} reformation re]{.underline}-\[END PAGE XIX\]
[quires]{.underline} that [[the organizer work inside the
system]{.mark}, among not only the middle class but the]{.underline} 40
per cent of American families-[more than seventy million people-whose
incomes range from \$5,000 to \$10,000 a year. They **cannot be
dismissed by labeling them blue collar**]{.underline} or hard hat. They
will not continue to be relatively passive and slightly challenging. [If
we fail to communicate with them, **[if we don\'t encourage]{.mark} them
to form [alliances]{.mark} with us, [they will move to the
right]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Maybe they will anyway, but [let\'s not
let it happen by default]{.underline}. Our [youth are impatient with the
preliminaries]{.underline} that are [essential to purposeful action.
**[Effective organization is thwarted by the desire for instant and
dramatic change]{.mark}**, or]{.underline} as I have phrased it
elsewhere the [demand for revelation rather than
revolution]{.underline}. It\'s the kind of thing we see in play writing;
the first act introduces the characters and the plot, in the second act
the plot and characters are developed as the play strives to hold the
audience\'s attention. In the final act good and evil have their
dramatic confrontation and resolution. [The present generation wants to
go right into the third act, skipping the first two, in which case there
is no play, **nothing but confrontation for confrontation\'s
sake**]{.underline}-a flare-up and back to darkness. [To build a
powerful organization takes time. It is tedious, but that\'s the way the
game is played-if you want to play and not just yell]{.underline},
\"Kill the umpire.\" [[What is the alternative to working \"inside\" the

down!**]{.mark}**\"**]{.underline} Yippie [yells of]{.underline} \"Do
it!\" or [\"Do your thing.\" What else? Bombs?]{.underline} Sniping?
[Silence when police are killed and screams of \"murdering fascist
pigs\" when others are killed? Attacking and baiting the police? Public
suicide? \"Power comes out of the barrel of a gun!\" [is]{.mark} an
[absurd]{.mark} rallying cry]{.underline} \[END PAGE XX\] [**[when the
other side has all the guns]{.mark}**. Lenin was a pragmatist; when he
returned]{.underline} to what was then Petrograd [from exile, he
said]{.underline} that [the Bolsheviks stood for getting power through
the ballot but would reconsider after they got the guns!]{.underline}
Militant mouthings? [Spouting quotes from Mao, Castro, and Che Guevara,
which are as germane to our highly technological, computerized,
cybernetic, nuclear- powered, mass media society as a stagecoach on a
jet runway]{.underline} at Kennedy airport? [Let us in the name of
radical pragmatism not forget that in our system]{.underline} with all
its repressions [we can still speak out and denounce the administration,
attack its policies, work to build an opposition political base. True,
there is government harassment, but there still is that **relative
freedom to fight**. I can attack my government, try to organize to
change it. That\'s more than I can do in]{.underline} Moscow, Peking, or
[Havana]{.underline}. Remember the reaction of the Red Guard to the
\"cultural revolution\" and the fate of the Chinese college students.
[Just a few of the violent episodes of bombings or a courtroom
shootout]{.underline} that [we have experienced here would have resulted
in a sweeping purge and mass executions in Russia, China, or Cuba.
Let\'s keep some perspective]{.underline}.[[We will start with the
system because there is **no other place to start
from**]{.underline}]{.mark} except political lunacy. It is most
important for those of us who want revolutionary change to understand
that [[**revolution must be preceded by reformation**.]{.mark} To
assume]{.underline} that [a political revolution can survive without the
supporting base of a popular reformation is to ask for the impossible in
politics]{.underline}. [Men \[and women\] don\'t like to
step]{.underline} abruptly [out of]{.underline} the security of
[familiar experience]{.underline}; they need a bridge to cross from
their own experience to a new way. [A revolutionary
organizer]{.underline} \[END PAGE XXI\] [must shake up the prevailing
patterns of their lives- agitate, create]{.underline} disenchantment and
[discontent with the current values]{.underline}, to produce, .if not a
passion for change, at least a passive, affirmative, non-challenging
climate. \"The Revolution was \'effected before the war commenced,\"
John Adams wrote. \"The Revolution was in the hearts and minds of the
people...This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and
affections of the people was the real American Revolution.\" A
[[revolution without a prior reformation would collapse or become a
totalitarian tyranny]{.underline}]{.mark}. A [reformation
means]{.underline} that [masses of our people have reached the point of
disillusionment with past ways]{.underline} and values. [They don\'t
know what will work but they do know]{.underline} that [the prevailing
system is self-defeating]{.underline}, frustrating, [and hopeless. They
won\'t act for change but won\'t strongly oppose those who do. The time
is then ripe for revolution]{.underline}. [[Those]{.mark}
who]{.underline}, for whatever combination of reasons, [encourage the
opposite of reformation, [become the **unwitting allies of the far
political right**.]{.mark} Parts of the far left]{.underline} have gone
so far in the political circle that they [are now all but
indistinguishable from the extreme right]{.underline}. It reminds me of
the days when Hitler, new on the scene, was excused for his actions by
\"humanitarians\" on the grounds of a paternal rejection and childhood
trauma. When there are people who espouse the assassination of Senator
Robert Kennedy or the Tate murders or the Marin County Courthouse
kidnapping and killings or the University of Wisconsin bombing and
killing as \"revolutionary acts,\" then we are dealing with people who
are merely hiding psychosis behind a political mask. [The masses of
people recoil with horror and say, \"Our way is bad and we were willing
to let it change, but certainly not for this murderous madness-no
matter]{.underline} \[END PAGE XXII\] [how bad things are now, they are
better than that.\" So they begin to turn back. They regress into
acceptance of a coming massive repression in the name of \"law and
order.\"]{.underline}

105 Northwestern University Law Review 149,
http://www.law.northwestern.edu/lawreview/v105/n1/149/LR105n1Driver.pdf)

B. Consistency and Inconsistency of Racial Status [The
interest-convergence theory holds that, because black people re- ceive
relief from racial oppression only when it suits the interests of the
white establishment, the status of blacks and the status of whites
remained relatively constant throughout the latter half of the twentieth
century-and perhaps even throughout the nation\'s entire
history.]{.underline} According to Professor Bell, as discussed
above,119 the interest-convergence theory at work throughout United
States history links contemporary racial developments to the unvamished
racism of seemingly bygone eras. [[This misperception- that the status
of blacks]{.mark} and whites [has been characterized by continuity ra-
ther than change]{.mark} during the last several decades-[erroneously
minimizes]{.mark} one of the [leading transformations]{.mark} of
American society during that time. One need not believe that racism has
been completely vanquished or that there is no longer any advantage
associated with whiteness to [acknowledge that **the status of both
racial groups has experienced profound transforma-
tions**]{.mark}]{.underline} since World War ll. I . Status of
Blacks.-Professor Bell has long asserted that the inter- est-convergence
theory reveals how contemporary blacks have a good deal in common with
their enslaved ancestors: \"The difference in the condition of slaves in
one of the gradual emancipation states and black people today is more of
degree than of kind.\'\'\'\'\'\' [Under this view, the fall of Jim Crow
was largely a formality, as conditions for African-Americans in the
modern era retain an eerie similarity to the days of yore.]{.underline}
Even though signs indicat- ing separate water fountains for blacks and
whites have long since disap- peared, Professor [Bell asserts that
\"contemporary color barriers are less visible but neither less real nor
less oppressive]{.underline}.\"\"\' While it may seem that to state this
point is to refute it, arguments as- serting an absence of genuine
racial change for contemporary black citizens are surprisingly
widespread. Indeed, in the face of the overwhelming evi- dence of the
tremendous strides that the United States has made with re- spect to
race relations since World War II,\'\'\' the notion that conditions have
improved for blacks only on the margins enjoys prominent support both in
the legal academy\"\' and in the larger culture.\'3\' [Accordingly, it
is necessary to observe that [the racial existence of blacks in modern
America would be unrecognizable]{.mark}, and perhaps even unfathomable,
[to]{.mark} their [enslaved \[relatives\]. Contending that the
existence]{.mark} of blacks [today can be analogized]{.mark} to people
who were literally (not metaphorically) denied their freedom or to
people who had their liberty thoroughly circumscribed by Jim Crow [mini-
mizes the suffering of individuals who endured the yoke of unrelenting
ra- cial oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the goal of racial
equality has certainly not yet been fully rea- lized, the racial
progress that has been made over the generations has dra- matically
elevated the racial status of blacks. [Examples abound of racial
progress for blacks in their everyday lives.\'\" [To appreciate]{.mark}
the genuine [ra- cial progress]{.mark} that has been made, it is
necessary [merely to recall the Su- preme Court\'s statements]{.mark} in
notorious cases openly acknowledging and affirming the inferior social
status of blacks. [In Dred Scott v. Sandford]{.mark}, Chief Justice
Taney\'s opinion stated that, in the eyes of the Framers, [blacks
\"had]{.mark} for more tha\[n\] a century before [been regarded as
beings of an inferior order]{.mark}, and altogether unfit to associate
with the white race, either in social or political
relations.\"]{.underline}l26 [[In Plessy v. Ferguson]{.mark}, the Court
made the then-unremarkable point that [a black man \"is not lawfully
entitled to the reputa-tion of being]{.mark} a [white]{.mark}
man]{.underline}.\"\'27 [Not only would [such arguments]{.mark} no
longer appear in the U.S. Reports but they [would no longer be
uttered]{.mark} in polite company. The significance of that change
cannot be underestimated. [The Supreme Court has]{.mark}]{.underline},
moreover, [[played]{.mark} at least [some role in closing the
gap]{.mark} between the status of blacks and the status of whites. While
many Supreme Court cases involving race received a great deal of
attention be-cause they seemed dramatic, it is perhaps most helpful here
to remember a case that affected the quotidian. Not long ago, black
people were typically denied the honor of being addressed
formally,]{.underline} even in formal settings. [Among the list of
racial slights that Martin Luther King Jr. listed in his Let-ter from
Birmingham City Jail as justifying his civil disobedience was the
refusal of white people to accord blacks the respect of using formal
titles]{.underline}: I guess it is easy for those who have never felt
the stinging darts of segregation to say, \"Wait.\" But when you have
seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your
sisters and brothers at whim; \... when your first name becomes
\"nigger\" and your middle name becomes \"boy\"\... and when your wife

permit black citizens to be treated with diminished status before the

#### Afro pessimism mistakes "an" anti-black world, characterized by anti-black instructions that deny Black freedom, for an antiblack world\-\--both pessimism and optimism fail to take political responsibility for political actions, a conception of blacks as human reframes "so-called" failures as actions that alter the possibilities of change

"Thoughts on Afropessimism," Critical Political Theory (2017), p. 1-8

''Afropessimism'' came out of ''Afro-pessimism.'' The elimination of the
hyphen is an important development, since it dispels ambiguity and in
effect announces a specific mode of thought. Should the hyphen remain,
the ambiguity would be between pessimistic people of African descent and
theoretical pessimism. The conjoined, theoretical term is what
proponents often have in mind in their diagnosis of what I shall call
''the black condition.'' [The [appeal to a black condition is]{.mark}
peculiarly [existential]{.mark}. Existentialists reject notions of human
''nature'' on the grounds that human beings live in worlds they also
construct; they produce their socalled essence. **[That does not
mean]{.mark}, however, [human beings lack
anchorage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Everyone has to start from
somewhere.]{.underline} [Existentialists call that somewhere a condition
or conditions for these reasons, and the world human beings produce or
through which we live is sometimes called ''human
reality.]{.underline}''

[[Critics of existentialism]{.mark} often [reject its human
formulation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Heidegger, for instance, in his
''Letter on Humanism,'' lambasted Sartre for supposedly in effect
subordinating Being to a philosophical anthropology with dangers of
anthropocentrism (Heidegger, 1971). [Yet a philosophical understanding
of culture raises the problem of the conditions through which
philosophical reflections could emerge as meaningful. Although a human
activity, a more radical understanding of culture raises the question of
the human being as the producer of an open reality. If the human being
is in the making, then ''human reality'' is never complete and is more
the relations in which such thought takes place than a claim about the
thought]{.underline}. The etymology of existence already points to these
elements. From the Latin ex sistere, ''to stand out,'' it also means to
appear; against invisibility in the stream of effects through which the
human world appears, much appears through the creative and at times
alchemic force of human thought and deed. Quarrels with and against
existential thought are many. In more recent times, they've emerged
primarily from Marxists, structuralists, and poststructuralists, even
though there were, and continue to be, many existential Marxists and
even existentialists with structuralist and poststructuralist leanings.

[I begin with this tale of philosophical abstraction to contextualize
Afropessimism.]{.underline} [Its main exemplars,]{.underline} [such as
Jared Sexton and Frank Wilderson III, emerged from academic literary
theory, an area dominated by poststructuralism even in many cases that
avow ''Marxism.]{.underline}'' Sexton (2010) and Wilderson (2007) divert
from a reductive poststructuralism, however, through examining important
existential moves inaugurated, as Daniel McNeil (2011, 2012) observed,
by Fanon and his intellectual heirs. [The critical question that
Afropessimism addresses in this fusion is the viability of posed
strategies of Black liberation]{.underline}. (I'm using the capital
''B'' here to point not only to the racial designation ''black'' but
also to the nationalist one ''Black.'' Afropessimists often mean both,
since blacks and Blacks have a central and centered role in their
thought.) [The world that produced blacks and in consequence Blacks is,
for Afropessimists, a crushing, historical one whose Manichaean divide
is sustained contraries best kept segregated.]{.underline} [Worse, any
effort of mediation leads to confirmed black subordination]{.underline}.
[Overcoming this requires purging the world of antiblackness. Where
cleansing the world is unachievable, an alternative is to disarm the
force of antiblack racism. Where whites lack power over blacks, they
lose relevance]{.underline} -- [at least politically and at levels of
cultural and racial capital or hegemony]{.underline}.
[Wilderson]{.underline} (2008), for instance, [explores my concept of
''an antiblack world'' to build similar arguments. Sexton]{.underline}
(2011) [makes similar moves in his discussions of ''social
death.]{.underline}'' As this forum doesn't afford space for a long
critique, I'll offer several, non-exhaustive criticisms.

[The first is that]{.underline} [''**[an]{.mark}** [antiblack
world'']{.mark}]{.underline} [[is not identical with ''**the** world is
antiblack]{.underline}.]{.mark}'' [My argument is that [such a world is
an]{.mark} [antiblack]{.mark} racist [project]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[It is [not the historical achievement]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Its
[limitations emerge from]{.mark} [a basic fact]{.mark}]{.underline}[:
[Black people]{.underline}]{.mark} [and other opponents of such a
project [fought, and continue to fight]{.mark}, as we see today in the
#BlackLivesMatter movement and many others, against it]{.underline}.
[[The same argument applies to]{.mark} the argument about **[social
death]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Such an achievement would have rendered
even these reflections stillborn. The basic premises of the
[Afropessimistic argument are]{.mark}, then, [locked in **performative
contradictions**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet, they have rhetorical force.
This is evident through the continued growth of its proponents and
forums (such as this one) devoted to it.

In Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism, I argued that there are forms of
antiblack racism offered under the guise of love, though I was writing
about whites who exoticize blacks while offering themselves as white
sources of black value. Analyzed in terms of bad faith, where one lies
to oneself in an attempt to flee displeasing truths for pleasing
falsehoods, exoticists romanticize blacks while affirming white
normativity, and thus themselves, as principals of reality. These
ironic, [performative contradictions are features of all forms of
racism, where one group is elevated to godlike status and another is
pushed below that of human despite both claiming to be
human]{.underline}.

[Antiblack racism offers whites self-other relations]{.underline}
(necessary for ethics) [with each other but not so for groups forced in
a ''zone of nonbeing'' below them]{.underline}. There is asymmetry where
whites stand as others who look downward to those who are not their
others or their analogues. [[Antiblack racism is]{.mark} thus [not a
problem of blacks being ''others]{.mark}.'' It's a problem of their
not-being-analogical-selves-and-not-evenbeing- others]{.underline}.
Fanon, in Black Skin, White Masks (1952), reminds us that [Blacks among
each other live in a world of selves and others. It is in attempted
relations with whites that these problems occur.]{.underline} Reason in
such contexts has a bad habit of walking out when Blacks enter. What are
Blacks to do? As reason cannot be forced, because that would be
''violence,'' they must ironically reason reasonably with forms of
unreasonable reason. Contradictions loom[. Racism is]{.underline}, given
these arguments, [a project of imposing non-relations as the model of
dealing with people designated ''black.]{.underline}''

In Les Damne´ de la terre (''Damned of the Earth''), Fanon goes further
and argues that colonialism is an attempt to impose a Manichean
structure of contraries instead of a dialectical one of ongoing, human
negotiation of contradictions. The former segregates the groups; the
latter emerges from interaction. The police, he observes, are the
mediator in such a situation, as their role is force/violence instead of
the human, discursive one of politics and civility (Fanon, 1991). Such
societies draw legitimacy from Black non-existence or invisibility.
Black appearance, in other words, would be a violation of those systems.
Think of the continued blight of police, extra-judicial killings of
Blacks in those countries.

[An immediate observation of many postcolonies is that antiblack
attitudes, practices, and institutions aren't exclusively white. Black
antiblack dispositions make this clear. Black antiblackness entails
Black exoticism]{.underline}. Where this exists, [Blacks simultaneously
receive Black love alongside Black rejection of agency. Many problems
follow. The absence of agency bars maturation, which would reinforce the
racial logic of Blacks as in effect wards of whites. Without agency,
ethics, liberation, maturation, politics, and responsibility could not
be possible]{.underline}.

Afropessimism faces the problem of a hidden premise of white agency
versus Black incapacity. Proponents of Afropessimism would no doubt
respond that the theory itself is a form of agency reminiscent of
Fanon's famous remark that though whites created le Ne\`gre it was les
Ne\`gres who created Ne´gritude. [[Whites]{.mark} clearly [did not
create Afropessimism]{.mark}, which Black liberationists should
celebrate. [We should avoid]{.mark} the fallacy]{.underline}, however,
[of [confusing source with outcome]{.mark}.]{.underline} [History is not
short of bad ideas from good people]{.underline}. [[If intrinsically
good]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[each person of African descent
would become ethically]{.mark} and epistemologically [a switching of the
Manichean contraries,]{.mark} which means [only **changing players
instead of the game**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[We come]{.underline}, then, [to the crux of the matter. [If the goal of
Afropessimism is Afropessimism, its achievement would be
attitudinal]{.mark} and, in the language of old, stoic]{.underline} --
[in short, a symptom of antiblack society.]{.underline} At this point,
[there are several observations that follow. The first is a diagnosis of
the implications of Afropessimism as symptom. The second examines the
epistemological implications of Afropessimism. The third is whether a
disposition counts as a political act and, if so, is it sufficient for
its avowed aims]{.underline}. There are more, but for the sake of
brevity, I'll simply focus on these.

[An ironic dimension of [pessimism]{.mark} is that it [is the other side
of optimism]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Oddly enough, [both are connected to
nihilism,]{.mark} which is]{.underline}, as Nietzsche (1968) showed, [a
decline of values during periods of social decay. It emerges when people
no longer want to be responsible for their actions. [Optimists expect
intervention]{.mark} from beyond. [Pessimists declare relief is not
forthcoming]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Neither takes
responsibility]{.mark} for what is valued]{.underline}**. [The valuing,
however, is what leads to the second, epistemic point.]{.underline} [The
presumption that what is at stake is what can be known to determine what
can be done is the problem. If such knowledge were possible, the debate
would be about who is reading the evidence correctly.]{.underline} [Such
judgment would be a priori -- that is, prior to events actually
unfolding. The future, unlike transcendental conditions such as
language, signs, and reality, is, however, ex post facto: It is yet to
come.]{.underline} [Facing the future, the question isn't what will be
or how do we know what will be but instead the realization that whatever
is done will be that on which the future will depend. Rejecting optimism
and pessimism, [there is]{.mark} a supervening
[alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}[: **[political
commitment]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

The appeal to political commitment is not only in stream with what
French existentialists call l'intellectuel engage´ (committed
intellectual) but also reaches back through the history and existential
situation of enslaved, racialized ancestors. Many were, in truth, an
existential paradox: commitment to action without guarantees. The slave
revolts, micro and macro acts of resistance, escapes, and returns help
others do the same; the cultivated instability of plantations and other
forms of enslavement, and countless other actions, were waged against a
gauntlet of forces designed to eliminate any hope of success. The claim
of colonialists and enslavers was that the future belonged to them, not
to the enslaved and the indigenous. A result of more than 500 years of
conquest and 300 years of enslavement was also a (white) rewriting of
history in which African and First Nations' agency was, at least at the
level of scholarship, nearly erased. Yet there was resistance even in
that realm, as Africana and First Nation intellectual history and
scholarship attest. Such actions set the course for different kinds of
struggle today.

Such reflections occasion meditations on the concept of failure.
[[Afropessimism]{.mark}, the existential critique suggests, **[suffers
from]{.mark} a [failure to understand failure]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Consider Fanon's notion of constructive failure, [where what doesn't
initially work transforms conditions for something new to
emerge]{.underline}. To understand this argument, one must rethink the
philosophical anthropology at the heart of a specific line of Euromodern
thought on what it means to be human[. Atomistic and individual
substance]{.underline}- [based, this model, articulated by Hobbes,
Locke, and many others, is of a non-relational being that thinks, acts,
and moves along a course in which continued movement depends on not
colliding with others]{.underline}. Under that model, [the human being
is a thing that enters a system that facilitates or obstructs its
movement.]{.underline} [An alternative model, shared by many groups
across southern Africa, is a relational version of the human being as
part of a larger system of meaning.]{.underline} [Actions, from that
perspective, are not about whether ''I'' succeed but instead about
''our'' story across time]{.underline}. As relational, **[it means that
[each human]{.mark} being [is a constant negotiation of]{.mark} ongoing
[efforts to build relationships]{.mark} with others]{.underline}**,
[which means no one actually enters a situation without establishing new
situations of action and meaning. Instead of entering a game, their
participation requires a different kind of project]{.underline} --
[especially where the ''game'' was premised on their
exclusion]{.underline}. [Thus, where the system or game repels initial
participation, such **repulsion is a shift in the grammar of how the
system functions**, especially its dependence on obsequious
subjects]{.underline}. **[[Shifted energy affords emergence of
alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Kinds cannot be known before the
actions that birthed them]{.underline}.

[Abstract as this sounds, it has much **historical
support**]{.underline}. Evelyn Simien (2016), in her insightful
political study Historic Firsts, examines the new set of relations
established by Shirley Chisholm's and Jesse Jackson's presidential
campaigns. [There could be no Barack Obama]{.underline} [without such
important predecessors affecting the demographics of voter
participation]{.underline}. Simien intentionally focused on the most
mainstream example of political life to illustrate this point. [Although
no exemplar of radicalism, Obama's ''success'' emerged from Chisholm and
Jackson's (and many others') so-called ''failure.'']{.underline} [Beyond
presidential electoral politics, [there are numerous examples of]{.mark}
[how]{.mark} prior, radical [so-called ''failures'' transformed
relationships that facilitated other]{.mark} kinds of [outcome]{.mark}.
The trail goes back to the Haitian Revolution and back to every act of
resistance from Nat Turner's Rebellion in the USA, Sharpe's in Jamaica,
or Tula's in Curac¸ao and so many other efforts for social
transformation to come.]{.underline}

[In existential terms, then, many ancestors of the African diaspora
embodied]{.underline} what Søren Kierkegaard (1983) calls an
[existential paradox]{.underline}. [All the evidence around them
suggested failure and the futility of hope]{.underline}. [They first had
to make a movement of **infinite resignation**]{.underline} -- [that is,
resigning themselves to their situation]{.underline}. [Yet they must
simultaneously act against that situation. Kierkegaard called this
seemingly contradictory phenomenon ''faith,'' but that concept relates
more to a relationship with a transcendent, absolute being, which could
only be established by a ''leap,]{.underline}'' as there are no
mediations or bridge. [Ironically, if Afropessimism appeals to
transcendent intervention, it would collapse into faith.
If]{.underline}, [however, the argument rejects transcendent
intervention and **focuses on committed political action**]{.underline},
[of taking responsibility for a future that offers no guarantees, then
the movement from infinite resignation becomes **existential political
action**]{.underline}.

[At this point, the crucial meditation would be on politics and
political action. [An attitude of infinite resignation]{.mark} to the
world without the leap of committed action [would simply be]{.mark}
pessimistic or [nihilistic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Similarly, [[an
attitude]{.mark} of hope or [optimism]{.mark} about the future [would
lack infinite resignation]{.mark}. We see here the underlying failure of
the two approaches. Yet ironically, there is a form of failure at
failing in the pessimistic turn versus the optimistic one, since if
focused exclusively on resignation as the goal, then the ''act'' of
resignation would have been achieved, which, paradoxically, would be a
success; it would be a successful failing of failure]{.underline}. [[For
politics to emerge]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[there are two
missing elements]{.mark} in inward pessimistic resignation.]{.underline}

[The [first is that politics]{.mark} is a social
phenomenon]{.underline}, [which means **it [requires]{.mark} the
[expanding options of a social world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Turning
away from the social world, though a statement about politics, is
not]{.underline}, however, [in and of itself political]{.underline}.
[The ancients from whom much western political theory or philosophy
claimed affinity had a disparaging term for individuals who resigned
themselves from political life]{.underline}: idio¯te¯s, [a private
person, one not concerned with public affairs, in a word]{.underline} --
[an idiot. I mention western political theory because that is the
hegemonic intellectual context of Afropessimism]{.underline}. We don't,
however, have to end our etymological journey in ancient Greek.
Extending our linguistic archaeology back a few thousand years, we could
examine the Middle Kingdom Egyptian word idi (deaf). The presumption,
later taken on by the ancient Athenians and Macedonians, was that a lack
of hearing entailed isolation, at least in terms of audio speech. [The
contemporary inward [resignation]{.mark} of seeking a form of purity
[from the]{.mark} loathsome [historical reality of racial
oppression]{.mark}, in this reading, [collapses]{.mark} ultimately
[into]{.mark} a form of [moralism]{.mark}]{.underline} (private,
normative satisfaction) [[instead of public responsibility]{.mark} born
of and borne by action]{.underline}.

[[The second]{.mark} is [the **importance of
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Politics makes no sense without
it.]{.underline} But what is power? Eurocentric etymology points to the
Latin word potis as its source, from which came the word ''potent'' as
in an omnipotent god. If we again look back further, we will notice the
Middle Kingdom (2000 BCE--1700 BCE) KMT/ Egyptian word pHty, which
refers to godlike strength. Yet for those ancient Northeast Africans,
even the gods' abilities came from a source: In the Coffin Texts, HqAw
or heka activates the ka (sometimes translated as soul, spirit, or, in a
word, ''magic''), which makes reality. All [this amounts to a
straightforward thesis on power as the ability with the means to make
things happen.]{.underline}

[There is an alchemical quality to power. The human world, premised on
symbolic communication, brings many forms of meaning into being, and
those new meanings afford relationships that build institutions through
a world of culture,]{.underline} a phenomenon that Freud (1989) rightly
described as ''a prosthetic god.'' It is godlike because it addresses
what humanity historically sought from the gods: protection from the
elements, physical maledictions, and social forms of misery. [Such power
clearly can be abused. It is where those enabling
capacities]{.underline} (empowerment) [are pushed to the wayside in the
hording of social resources into propping up some people as gods that
the legitimating practices of cultural cum political institutions
decline and stimulate pessimism and nihilism. That institutions in the
Americas very rarely attempt establishing positive relations to Blacks
is the subtext of Afropessimism and this entire meditation.]{.underline}

[The [discussion points]{.mark}, however, [to]{.mark} a **[demand for
political commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Politics]{.mark} itself
emerges under different names throughout the history of our species, but
the one occasioning the word ''politics'']{.underline} is from the Greek
po´lis, which [[refers to]{.mark} ancient Hellenic city-states. It
identifies [specific]{.mark} kinds of [activities]{.mark} conducted
inside the city-state, [where order necessitated]{.mark} the [resolution
of conflicts through rules]{.mark} of discourse the violation of which
could lead to (civil) war, a breaking down of relations appropriate for
''outsiders.'']{.underline} Returning to the Fanonian observation of
selves and others, [it is clear that imposed limitations on certain
groups amounts to impeding or blocking the option of
politics]{.underline}. [Yet, as a problem occurring within the polity,
the problem short of war becomes a political one]{.underline}.

[Returning to Afropessimistic challenges, the question becomes this: [If
the problem of antiblack racism is]{.mark} conceded as [political, where
antiblack institutions of power have]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[as their
project, the impeding of Black power]{.mark}, which in effect requires
barring Black access to political institutions,]{.underline} **[then
[antiblack societies are]{.mark} ultimately [threats]{.mark} also [to
politics]{.mark} [defined as the human negotiation of the expansion of
human capabilities or]{.mark} more [to]{.mark} the point:
[freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[Anti-politics is one of the reasons why societies in which antiblack
racism is hegemonic are also those in which racial moralizing dominates:
moralizing stops at individuals at the expense of addressing
institutions the transformation of which would make immoral individuals
irrelevant.]{.underline} [**As a political problem, it demands a
political solution**. It is not accidental that Blacks continue to be
the continued exemplars of unrealized freedom.]{.underline} As so many
from Ida B. Wells-Barnett to Angela Davis (2003) and Michelle Alexander
(2010) have shown, [the expansion of privatization and incarceration is
squarely placed in a structure of states and civil societies premised on
the limitations of freedom]{.underline} (Blacks) -- [ironically, as seen
in countries such as South Africa and the **U**nited **S**tates, in the
name of freedom]{.underline}.

[That [power is a facilitating]{.mark} or enabling [phenomenon]{.mark},
a functional element [of the human world, a viable response must
be]{.mark} the **[establishing]{.mark} of [relations that reach beyond
the]{.mark} singularity of the [body]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [I bring
this up because [proponents of Afropessimism]{.mark} might [object
to]{.mark} this analysis because of its [appeal to a human
world]{.mark}. If that world is abrogated, the site of struggle becomes
that which is patently not human]{.underline}. It is not accidental that
popular race discourse refers today to ''black bodies,'' for instance,
instead of ''black people.'' [[As the human world is discursive, social,
and relational,]{.mark} this [abandonment amounts to]{.mark} an appeal
to the non-relational, the incommunicability of singularity, and
[appeals to the body]{.mark} and its reach]{.underline}. At that point,
it's perhaps the psychologist, psychiatrist, or psychoanalyst who would
be helpful, as turning radically inward offers the promise of despair,
narcissistic delusions of godliness, and, as Fanon also observed,
madness. [Even if that slippery slope were rejected, [the performative
contradiction of attempting to communicate]{.mark} such singularity or
[absence]{.mark} thereof [requires,]{.mark} at least for consistency,
the appropriate course of action: [silence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} remaining [question]{.mark} for
Afropessimism,]{.underline} especially those who are primarily
academics, [[becomes]{.mark} this: [Why write]{.mark}? It's a question
for which, in both existential and political terms,]{.underline} I don't
see how an answer could be given from an Afropessimistic perspective
without the unfortunate revelation of cynicism. [[The marketability of
Afropessimism is]{.mark} no doubt in the immediate and **[paradoxical
satisfaction in dissatisfaction]{.mark} it offers**]{.underline}. [[We
are]{.mark} at this point on familiar terrain. As with ancient logical
paradoxes [denying the viability of]{.mark} time and motion, [the best
option]{.mark}, after a moment of immobilized reflection,
is]{.underline}, eventually, [[to move on, even where the pause is
itself significant]{.mark} as an encomium of thought]{.underline}.

For Thomas, there is no meaningful difference between laws designed to
entrench racial subordination and those designed to alleviate conditions
of oppression. **[Critics may point out that colorblindness in practice
has the effect of entrenching existing racial disparities]{.underline}**
in health, wealth, and society. **[But [in framing the debate in purely
ideological terms, opponents]{.mark} are able to [avoid the contentious
issue of outcomes and make viability determinations based exclusively on

Analytically, moreover, there is somehow no white colonialism for Blacks
to fight in Africa or Black countries of Black people anywhere and no
terrible landlessness that afflicts the African diasporas of Blackness
captive within white settler and/or imperial state formations, for
Wilderson and Afro- pessimism ( 2.0 )

The pessimist rejection of anti-colonialism goes particularly awry with
Fanon. The institution of academia came to Fanon late with great
selectivity. It isolates him from the whole tradition of Black
anti-colonialism (or anti-colonialist Blackness) so that he becomes a
cipher, a sort of color-blinding Rorschach test even. In fact, Fanon is
isolated from himself. The Fanon taken up like a weapon by the Black
liberation movement of the 1960s and \'70s with the \"African
Revolution\" at large was a militant practitioner and is the author of
an extant four-volume body of work recently even collected in the form
of a hefty oeuvre complète by French as well as Arabic world
publishers(i.e., La Découverte and Al Hibr). The Fanon examined in
academia got reduced to a very few pages of Black Skin, White Masks,
which was written when Fanon still thought he could be \"French\" and
faithful to French colonial empire while opposing physiognomic but not
cultural or \"civilizational\" racism. That text of the middle-class
assimilé is of two minds---ambivalent with its currents of brilliance.
Yet this \[End Page 295\] Fanon becomes \"post-colonialist\" for US
academia when truthfully he becomes \"anti-colonialist\" and only later
both in battle and in the related texts likewise disregarded by
Afro-pessimism (2.0): Wilderson privileges the colonized Fanon rather
than A Dying Colonialism and Toward the African Revolution as well as
The Wretched of the Earth.

The standard suppression of The Wretched of the Earth cannot succeed in
Red, White & Black. Wilderson tries to dichotomize Fanon so that Black
Skin, White Masks (1952) is cast as a text about \"race\" and
\"slavery,\" and thereby \"Blackness\": The Wretched of the Earth is by
contrast cast as a \"post-colonial\'s\" text primarily about \"land
restoration,\" or \"settler colonialism,\" as if they can be cast apart
from \"Blackness\" and Black struggles.32 This is a false dichotomy.
Fanon\'s corpus does not yield this schism. It should go without saying
that Black Skin, White Masks is itself a text of colonialism. It is
often and falsely read as an exclusively \"Caribbean\" text,
inapplicable to Afro-North America or even non-French colonies in the
Caribbean, despite its central references to Chester Himes and Richard
Wright as well as \"Brer Rabbit\" folklore; and even though this Fanon
had written, \"I come back to one fact: Wherever he goes, the Negro
remains a Negro.\"33 The Wretched of the Earth is often and falsely read
as an exclusively \"Algerian\" text, inapplicable to North America,
despite its numerous references to \"niggers\" as well as Négritude or
\"Negro-African\" culture---Blackness, especially for the Second
Congress of Black Writers and Artists in Rome; despite its global
\"Third World\" politics; and despite Fanon\'s aggressively militant
Pan-Africanism. It remains easy for some to ignore Fanon\'s insistent
categorization of the Algerian revolution as an African revolution as
well as how \"anti-Black racism\" along with anti-Black slavery has
lived on the African continent, not exclusively in Africa\'s Black
diaspora. Curiously, Wilderson\'s Incognegro would expose the
counter-insurgent canonization of Black Skin, White Masks in certain
quarters, thanks to his youthful contact with the Black Panther Party,
which did not dichotomize Blackness or anti-Blackness and colonialism or
anti-colonialism in its own revolutionary Fanonism. It trafficked mostly
in Les damnés de la terre: \"...my father had caught me with it last
night and beat the living daylights out of me---so I knew it must be
good. That had never happened with Invisible Man. Then, using one of my
old cocktail party gimmicks, I quoted a passage of Fanon from memory:
\'From birth, I began,\' it is clear to him that this narrow world,
strewn with prohibition, can only be called into question by absolute
violence.\' I told Darnell that for some strange reason that had made me
think about Kenwood, but why, I didn\'t know; nor did I know why my
father had beaten me when Fanon\'s other book, Black Skin, White Masks,
was nestled on his bookshelf beside the works of Sigmund Freud\"
(Wilderson 2008, 247).34 While Sexton counts the sum total of references
to \"Fanon\" in Red, White & Black, as if this datum \[End Page 296\]
alone should impress critical audiences, his tabulation begs the
question of which Fanon is referenced and how in a manner all too
faithful to the white academic management of Fanon and Fanonism as a
crisis to be contained by whatever means:35 Red, White & Black seeks to
quarantine The Wretched of the Earth from Kenwood or Minnesota, and all
settler sites of US colonialism, conceding it away from \"Blackness\" in
an ongoing quarrel with Native American, post-colonialist, and sometimes
Palestinian \"analogy,\" even though Wilderson needs to mine its
rhetoric at key moments---to speak of putting the enemy \"out of the
picture\" and bringing about \"the end of the world\" via \"absolute
violence,\" for example, when narratively these words then become the
words of \"Fanon\" rather than those of The Wretched of the Earth
specifically, given Wilderson\'s conventional academic preference for a
colonially decontextualized Black Skin, White Masks.

No antithesis of \"slavery,\" colonialism becomes unrecognizable as
colonialism in Wilderson in ways sacrificial of the Blacks and Blackness
subject to it---on and off official plantations. Firstly, colonialism
cannot be granted as an object of study to \"postcolonial\" theory in US
or Western academia. It can only appropriate the matter or study of
colonialism---from the long history of anti-colonialist theory and
praxes preceding it and persisting in spite of it---as a colonizing
political act itself, an arrogant critical appropriation that Wilderson
routinely accepts without question. What\'s more, slavery in
\"Plantation America\" is colonial slavery, just as colonialism is a
slaveocratic mode of colonialism in the Western Hemisphere. Walter
Rodney was sure to note as much explicitly in articles such as \"Slavery
and Underdevelopment\" (1979) as well as \"Plantation Society in
Guyana\" (1981). There is no system of slavery in any part of these
Americas that is not still settler colonial slavery; no settler
colonialism without chattel slavery or racial slavery and their
neo-slaveries. Finally in this regard, colonialism is not reducible to a
simple matter of cartography---or \"the postcolonial\'s capacity for
cartographic restoration.\"36 The likes of C.A. Diop and Césaire aside,
this is why Amilcar Cabral could write Our People Are Our Mountains
(1972); and why Sylvia Wynter would engage Anibal Quijano\'s
\"coloniality of power\" framework with \"Unsettling the Coloniality of
Being/Power/Truth/Freedom\" (2003); and why one apparently disappeared
Black radical tradition would theorize \"internal colonialism\" or
\"domestic colonialism\" along with \"eternal colonialism\" and
\"neo-colonialism,\" from within the US imperial colony, long before the
commercialization of \"postcolonialism\" or \"postcolonial theory\" in
Western academia. This is further why Fanon himself would write in A
Dying Colonialism: \"It is not the soil that is occupied. It is not the
ports or the airdromes. French colonialism has settled itself in the
very center of the Algerian individual and has undertaken a sustained
work of cleanup, of expulsion of self, of rationally pursued
mutilation\" (Fanon 1965, 65).37 This \[End Page 297\] is why Fanon
himself would write for an El Moujahid article now in Toward the African
Revolution: \"True liberation is not that pseudo-independence in which
ministers having a limited responsibility hobnob with an economy
dominated by the colonial pact. Liberation is the total destruction of
the colonial system, from the pre-eminence of the language of the
oppressor and \'departmentalization,\' to the customs union that in
reality maintains the former colonized in the meshes of the culture, of
the fashion, and of the images of the colonialist.\"38 This is also why
it is important to recall that it was never a strictly cartographic
colonialism bereft of slavery and Blackness that led Fanon to promulgate
his vision of \"new humanity\" so fully and graphically in The Wretched
of the Earth after A Dying Colonialism beyond Black Skin, White Masks.

**[Fanon\'s \"Worlds,\" Revisited]{.underline}**

Thus [[there is the serious problem of]{.mark}]{.underline} elliptical
truncation in [[Wilderson\'s]{.mark} repeated quotation of the \"[end of
the world\" line]{.mark}]{.underline} taken from Fanon\'s Black Skin,
White Masks. **[[The \"world\" is never so generic and singular as
pessimism would have it]{.underline}]{.mark}**, whether in or outside
this or that Fanon---whether it is the critical but \"French\" colonial
Fanon or the radically decolonizing Fanon who wages pan-African revolt
against the French and all colonialism. The younger Fanon wrote, \"The
Martinican is a man crucified. ...\[M\]y friend had fulfilled in a dream
his wish to become white---that is, to be man. ...I will tell him, \'The
environment, society are responsible for your delusion.\' Once that has
been said, the rest will follow of itself, and what that is we know. The
end of the world.\"39 The \"world\" in question is quite a specific one.
It is not the only world that is, or ever was, before another must be
created into being out of necessity. It is the white world that
represents itself \"as if\" (to borrow a turn of phrase from Wynter
here) it were the only world in truth.

Through the triple mechanism of capture, removal, and objectification,
[the [slave was]{.mark} forcibly [locked within a system that
prevented]{.mark} ~~him~~ [\[them\] from freely making]{.mark} of
~~his~~ [\[their\] life]{.mark}---and from ~~his~~ life---[something
true]{.mark}]{.underline}, something with its own consistency that could
stand on its own. [Everything produced by the slave was taken from
~~him~~]{.underline}: the products of his labor, offspring, the work of
his mind. He authored nothing that fully belonged to him. [Slaves were
considered mere merchandise, objects of luxury or utility to be bought
and sold to others. [At the same time]{.mark}, however, [they were
**human beings** endowed with the **ability to speak**, **capable of
creating and using tools**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Often deprived of
family ties, they were deprived as well of inheritance and of the
enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor. Those to whom they belonged,
and who extracted their unpaid labor, denied them their full humanity.
[Yet, [on a purely **ontological level**]{.mark} at least, [**their
humanity was never entirely erased**. They constituted]{.mark}, by the
force of things, [a **supplemental humanity** engaged in **constant
struggle** to **escape imprisonment**]{.mark} and repetition, and
[driven]{.mark} by a desire [to return to the place where **autonomous
creation had**]{.mark} **once [been
possible]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [suspended humanity of the
slave was defined by the fact that ~~he was~~ [\[they were\] condemned

perpetually]{.mark}**[, to announce]{.mark} ~~his~~ [\[their\]
radical]{.mark}, unsinkable [desire]{.mark}, and [to seek
liberty]{.mark} or vengeance. This was especially true when the enslaved
refused the radical abdication of the subject that was demanded of
them.]{.underline} Although legally defined as movable property,
[[**slaves always remained human**,]{.mark} despite the cruelty,
degradation, and dehumanization directed at them. Through their labor in
service of the master, [they **continued to create a world**.
Through]{.mark} gesture and [**speech**, they **wove relationships** and
a **universe of meaning**, **inventing languages**, **religions**,
**dances**]{.mark}, and [**rituals** and **creating

**abjection to which they were subjected** **never entirely eliminated
their capacity** to create symbols.]{.underline} By its very existence,
the [community of the enslaved **constantly tore** at the veil of
hypocrisy and lies in which slave-owning societies clothed
themselves.]{.underline} The [[slaves were **capable of rebellion**
and]{.mark} at times **[disposed of their own lives]{.mark}** through
suicide, thus [dispossessing their masters of their so-called
property]{.mark} and de facto abolishing the link of servitude. Those
who were burdened with the name "Black" were forcibly placed in a world
apart, yet [they retained]{.mark} the **[characteristics that made them
human beyond subjection]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Over time [[they
produced **ways of thinking**]{.mark} and languages [that were truly
their own]{.mark}. They invented their own literatures, music, and ways
of celebrating the divine. They were forced to **found their own
institutions**---schools, newspapers, political organizations, a public
sphere dif­ferent from the official public sphere.]{.underline} To a
large extent, [the term "Black" is the sign of minoritization and
confinement.]{.underline} It is an island of repose in the midst of
racial oppression and objective dehumanization.

#### Reducing black people to fungible bodies and reading their experiences through pain creates the worst form of depoliticization -- not only do they disregard black agency and resistance, they further perpetuate a narrative of white domination

Second only to a desire for increased diversity, better mental health
services were a chief priority for student protesters. Activists framed
their concerns and grievances in the language of personal trauma. We
shouldn't be surprised. While every generation of black Americans has
experienced unrelenting violence, this is the first one compelled to
witness virtually all of it, to endure the snuffing out of black lives
in real time, looped over and over again, until the next murder knocks
it off the news. [We are also talking about a generation that has lived
through two of the longest wars in U.S. history, raised on a culture of
spectacle where horrific acts of violence are readily
available]{.underline} on their smartphones. What Henry [Giroux
insightfully identifies as an addiction does nothing to inure or
desensitize young people to violence]{.underline}. On the contrary, it
anchors violence in their collective consciousness, produces fear and
paranoia -- wrapped elegantly in thrill -- and shrouds the many ways
capitalism, militarism, and racism are killing black and brown people.
So [one can easily see why the language of trauma might appeal to black
students. Trauma is real; it is no joke]{.underline}. Mental health
services and counseling are urgently needed. **[But [reading black
experience through trauma can easily slip into thinking of ourselves as
victims and objects rather than agents, subjected to]{.mark} centuries
of [gratuitous violence that have structured and overdetermined
our]{.mark} very [being]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the argot of our day,
"**[[bodies]{.mark}" -- [vulnerable and threatening]{.mark} bodies --
[increasingly stand in for]{.mark} actual [people with names,
experiences, dreams, and desires]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I suspect that
the popularity of Ta-Nehisi Coates's Between the World and Me (2015),
especially among black college students, rests on his singular emphasis
on fear, trauma, and the black body. He writes: "In America, it is
traditional to destroy the black body---it is heritage. Enslavement was
not merely the antiseptic borrowing of labor---it is not so easy to get
a human being to commit their body against its own elemental interest.
And so enslavement must be casual wrath and random manglings, the
gashing of heads and brains blown out over the river as the body seeks
to escape. It must be rape so regular as to be industrial. . . . The
spirit and soul are the body and brain, which are destructible---that is
precisely why they are so precious. And the soul did not escape. The
spirit did not steal away on gospel wings." [Coates]{.underline} implies
that the person is the brain, and the brain just another organ to be
crushed with the rest of the body's parts. Earlier in the book, he
[makes the startling declaration that enslaved people "knew nothing but
chains.]{.underline}" [I do not deny the violence Coates so eloquently
describes]{.underline} here, and I am sympathetic to his atheistic
skepticism. **[But [what sustained enslaved African people was a memory
of freedom, dreams of seizing it, and conspiracies to enact it
]{.mark}]{.underline}**-- fugitive planning, if you will. **[[If we
reduce the enslaved to]{.mark} mere [fungible bodies, we cannot]{.mark}
possibly [understand how they created families, communities, sociality;
how they fled]{.mark} and [loved]{.mark} and [worshiped]{.mark} [and
defended themselves]{.mark}; [how they created the world's first social
democracy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "**[[Trauma is real. But reading black
experience through trauma can lead to thinking of ourselves as victims
rather than agents.]{.mark}"]{.underline}** Moreover, [[to identify
anti-black violence as heritage]{.mark} may be true in a general sense,
but it [obscures the dialectic that produced]{.mark} and reproduced [the
violence of a regime dependent on black life for]{.mark} its
[profitability]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[It was]{.mark}, after all, [the
resisting black body that needed "correction]{.mark}]{.underline}**."
Violence was used not only to break bodies but to discipline people who
refused enslavement. And the impulse to resist is neither involuntary
nor solitary. [It is a choice made in community, made possible by
community, and informed by memory, tradition, and witness. If Africans
were entirely compliant and docile, there would have been no need for
vast expenditures on corrections, security, and violence. [Resistance is
our heritage]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [[resistance is our
healing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Through collective struggle, [[we alter
our circumstances]{.mark}; [contain, escape, or]{.mark} possibly
[eviscerate]{.mark} the source of [trauma]{.mark}; [recover our bodies;
reclaim]{.mark} and redeem [our dead; and make ourselves
whole]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is difficult to see this in a world where
words such as trauma, PTSD, micro-aggression, and triggers have
virtually replaced oppression, repression, and subjugation. Naomi
Wallace, a brilliant playwright whose work explores trauma in the
context of race, sexuality, class, war, and empire, muses: "Mainstream
America is less threatened by the 'trauma' theory because it doesn't
place economic justice at its core and takes the focus out of the realm
of justice and into psychology; out of the streets, communities, into
the singular experience (even if experienced in common) of the
individual." Similarly, George Lipsitz observes that [emphasizing
"interiority," personal pain, and feeling elevates "the cultivation of
sympathy over the creation of social justice." This is partly why
demands for reparations to address historical and ongoing racism are so
antithetical to modern liberalism.]{.underline} "[Through collective
struggle, we alter our circumstances; contain, escape, or possibly
eviscerate the source of trauma]{.underline}." [[Managing trauma does
not require dismantling structural racism]{.mark},]{.underline} which is
why university administrators focus on avoiding triggers rather than
implementing zero-tolerance policies for racism or sexual assault.
Buildings will be renamed and safe spaces for people of color will be
created out of a sliver of university real estate, but proposals to
eliminate tuition and forgive student debt for the descendants of the
dispossessed and the enslaved will be derided as absurd. This is also
why diversity and cultural-competency training are the most popular
strategies for addressing campus racism. As if racism were a
manifestation of our "incompetent" handling of "difference." If we
cannot love the other, we can at least learn to hear, respect,
understand, and "tolerate" her. Cultural competency also means reckoning
with white privilege, coming to terms with unconscious bias and the
myriad ways white folks benefit from current racial arrangements.
Powerful as this might be, the solution to racism still is shifted to
the realm of self-help and human resources, resting on self-improvement
or the hiring of a consultant or trainer to help us reach our goal.
Cultural-competency training, greater diversity, and demands for
multicultural curricula represent both a resistance to and manifestation
of our current "postracial" moment. In Are We All Postracial Yet?
(2015), David Theo Goldberg correctly sees postracialism as a neoliberal
revision of multicultural discourse, whose proposed remedies to address
racism would in fact resuscitate late-century multiculturalism. But why
hold on to the policies and promises of multiculturalism and diversity,
especially since they have done nothing to dislodge white supremacy?
Indeed I want to suggest that the triumph of multiculturalism marked a
defeat for a radical anti-racist vision. True, multiculturalism emerged
in response to struggles waged by the Black Freedom movement and other
oppressed groups in the 1960s and '70s. But the programmatic adoption of
diversity, inclusion, and multiculturalism vampirized the energy of a
radical movement that began by demanding the complete transformation of
the social order and the eradication of all forms of racial, gender,
sexual, and class hierarchy. The point of liberal multiculturalism was
not to address the historical legacies of racism, dispossession, and
injustice but rather to bring some people into the fold of a "society no
longer seen as racially unjust." What did it bring us? Black elected
officials and black CEOs who helped manage the greatest transfer of
wealth to the rich and oversee the continued erosion of the welfare
state; the displacement, deportation, and deterioration of black and
brown communities; mass incarceration; and planetary war. We talk about
breaking glass ceilings in corporate America while building more jail
cells for the rest. The triumph of liberal multiculturalism also meant a
shift from a radical anti-capitalist critique to a politics of
recognition. This means, for example, that we now embrace the right of
same-sex couples to marry so long as they do not challenge the
institution itself, which is still modeled upon the exchanging of
property; likewise we accept the right of people of color, women, and
queer people to serve in the military, killing and torturing around the
world. "I want to suggest that the triumph of multiculturalism marked a
defeat for a radical anti-racist vision." At the same time, contemporary
calls for cultural competence and tolerance reflect neoliberal logic by
emphasizing individual responsibility and suffering, shifting race from
the public sphere to the psyche. The postracial, Goldberg writes,
"renders individuals solely accountable for their own actions and
expressions, not for their group's." Tolerance in its multicultural
guise, as Wendy Brown taught us, is the liberal answer to managing
difference but with no corresponding transformation in the conditions
that, in the first place, marked certain bodies as suspicious, deviant,
abject, or illegible. Tolerance, therefore, depoliticizes genuine
struggles for justice and power: **[[Depoliticization involves
construing inequality, subordination, marginalization, and social
conflict, which]{.mark} all [require political analysis and political
solutions,]{.mark} as personal and individual, on the one hand, or as
natural, religious, or cultural on the other.]{.underline}** Tolerance
works along both vectors of depoliticization -- it personalizes and it
naturalizes or culturalizes -- and sometimes it intertwines them. But
[how can we embrace our students and acknowledge their pain while
remaining wary of a culture that reduces structural oppression to
misunderstanding and psychology]{.underline}? Love, Study, Struggle
Taped inside the top drawer of my desk is a small scrap of paper with
three words scrawled across it: "[Love, Study, Struggle]{.underline}."
It serves as a daily reminder of what I am supposed to be doing.
[[Black]{.mark} study and [resistance]{.mark} [must begin with]{.mark}
love.]{.underline} James Baldwin understood love-as-agency probably
better than anyone. For him it meant to love ourselves as black people;
it meant making love the motivation for making revolution; it meant
**[[envisioning a society where]{.mark} everyone is embraced, where
[there is no oppression]{.mark}, [where]{.mark} [every life is
valued]{.mark} -- [even those who]{.mark} may once [have been our
oppressors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It did not mean seeking white
people's love and acceptance or seeking belonging in the world created
by our oppressor. In The Fire Next Time (1963), he is unequivocal: "I do
not know many Negroes who are eager to be 'accepted' by white people,
still less to be loved by them; they, the blacks, simply don't wish to
be beaten over the head by the whites every instant of our brief passage
on this planet." But here is the catch: if we are committed to genuine
freedom, we have no choice but to love all. To love all is to fight
relentlessly to end exploitation and oppression everywhere, even on
behalf of those who think they hate us. This was Baldwin's point --
perhaps his most misunderstood and reviled point. [To love this way
requires relentless struggle, deep study, and critique]{.underline}.
**[[Limiting our ambit to suffering, resistance, and achievement is not
enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [We must go to the root -- the
historical, political, social, cultural, ideological, material, economic
root -- of oppression in order to understand its negation, the prospect
of our liberation]{.underline}. Going to the root illuminates what is
hidden from us, largely because most structures of oppression and all of
their various entanglements are simply not visible and not felt. For
example, **[[if we argue that state violence is merely a manifestation
of anti-blackness because that is what we see and feel, we are left with
no theory of the state and]{.mark} have [no way of understanding
racialized police violence in places]{.mark} such as Atlanta and
Detroit, [where most cops are black]{.mark}, unless we turn to some
metaphysical explanation.]{.underline}** For my generation, the formal
classroom was never the space for deep critique precisely because it was
not a place of love. The classroom was -- and still is -- a performative
space, where faculty and students compete with each other. Through study
groups, we created our own intellectual communities held together by
principle and love, though the specters of sectarianism, ego, and
just-plain childishness blurred our vision and threatened our
camaraderie. Still, the political study group was our lifeblood -- both
on and off campus. We lived by Karl Marx's pithy 1844 statement: "But if
the designing of the future and the proclamation of ready-made solutions
for all time is not our affair, then we realize all the more clearly
what we have to accomplish in the present -- I am speaking of a ruthless
criticism of everything existing, ruthless in two senses: The criticism
must not be afraid of its own conclusions, nor of conflict with the
powers that be." "If we argue that state violence is merely a
manifestation of anti-blackness because that is what we see and feel, we
are left with no theory of the state and have no way of understanding
racialized police violence." Study groups introduced me to C. L. R.
James, Frantz Fanon, Walter Rodney, Barbara Smith, Angela Davis, Karl
Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Chancellor Williams, George E.
M. James, Shulamith Firestone, Kwame Nkrumah, Kwame Turé, Rosa
Luxemburg, Antonio Gramsci, Chinweizu Ibekwe, Amílcar Cabral, and
others. These texts were our sources of social critique and weapons in
our class war on the bourgeois canon. As self-styled
activist-intellectuals, it never occurred to us to refuse to read a text
simply because it validated the racism, sexism, free-market ideology,
and bourgeois liberalism against which we railed. Nothing was off
limits. On the contrary, delving into these works only sharpened our
critical faculties. Love and study cannot exist without struggle, and
struggle cannot occur solely inside the refuge we call the university.
Being grounded in the world we wish to make is fundamental. As I argued
in Freedom Dreams nearly fifteen years ago, "Social movements generate
new knowledge, new theories, new questions. [The most [radical
ideas]{.mark} often [grow out of a concrete intellectual engagement with
the problems of aggrieved populations confronting systems of
oppression."]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Ironically I wrote these
words with my students in mind, many of whom were involved in campus
struggles, feeling a bit rudderless but believing that the only way to
make themselves into authentic activists was to leave the books and
radical theories at home or in their dorms. The undercommons offers
students a valuable model of study that takes for granted the
indivisibility of thought and struggle, not unlike its antecedent, the
Mississippi Freedom Schools.

Questioning the Transformative View: Some Doubts About Trashing The

The implications for Blacks of trashing liberal legal ideology are
troubling, even though it may be proper to assail belief structures that
obscure liberating possibilities. Trashing legal ideology seems to tell
us repeatedly what has already been established \-- that legal discourse
is unstable and relatively indeterminate. Furthermore[, trashing offers
**no idea of how to avoid the negative consequences of engaging in

world that it embodies]{.underline}. Yet Critics offer little beyond
this observation. Their [focus on delegitimating rights rhetoric seems
to suggest that]{.underline}, once rights rhetoric has been discarded,
[there exists a more productive strategy for change]{.underline}, one
[which does not reinforce existing patterns of domination]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, **[no such strategy has yet been
articulated]{.underline}**, and [it is difficult to imagine that racial
minorities will ever be able to discover one.]{.underline} As Frances
Fox Piven and Richard Cloward point out in their \[\*1367\] excellent
account of the civil rights movement, [popular struggles are a
reflection of institutionally determined logic and a challenge to that
logic]{.underline}. 137 **[[People can only demand change in ways that
reflect the logic of the institutions that they are
challenging]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 138 [[Demands for change that do not
reflect the institutional logic]{.underline}]{.mark} \-- that is,
demands [[that]{.mark} do not engage and subsequently [reinforce]{.mark}
the [dominant ideology \-- will]{.mark} probably [be
**ineffective**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 139 The possibility for
ideological change is created through the very process of legitimation,
which is triggered by crisis. [[Powerless people can]{.mark} sometimes
[trigger]{.mark} such a [crisis by challenging an institution]{.mark}
internally, that is, [by using its own logic against
it]{.mark}.]{.underline} 140 [[Such crisis occurs when powerless people
force open]{.mark} and politicize [a contradiction between the dominant
ideology and their reality]{.mark}]{.underline}. The political
consequences \[\*1368\] of maintaining the contradictions may sometimes
force an adjustment \-- an attempt to close the gap or to make things
appear fair. 141 Yet, because the adjustment is triggered by the
political consequences of the contradiction, circumstances will be
adjusted only to the extent necessary to close the apparent
contradiction. [This approach to]{.underline} understanding
[legitimation and change is applicable to]{.underline} the [civil
rights]{.underline} movement. Because Blacks were challenging their
exclusion from political society, the only claims that were likely to
achieve recognition were those that reflected American society\'s
institutional logic: legal rights ideology. Articulating their formal
demands through legal rights ideology, civil rights protestors exposed a
series of contradictions \-- the most important being the promised
privileges of American citizenship and the practice of absolute racial
subordination. [[Rather than using the contradictions to suggest]{.mark}
that [American citizenship was]{.mark} itself [illegitimate]{.mark} or
false, civil rights [protestors proceeded as if]{.mark} American
[citizenship were real, and demanded to exercise the "rights"]{.mark}
that citizenship [entailed.]{.mark} By seeking to restructure reality to
reflect American mythology]{.underline}, [[Blacks]{.mark}]{.underline}
relied upon and ultimately [[benefited]{.mark} from politically inspired
efforts to resolve the contradictions by granting]{.underline} formal
[rights.]{.underline} Although it is the need to maintain legitimacy
that presents powerless groups with the opportunity to wrest concessions
from the dominant order, it is the very accomplishment of legitimacy
that forecloses greater possibilities. In sum, the potential for change
is both created and limited by legitimation.

### 2AC -- Futurism good

#### The trajectory of blackness is forward toward the future -- taking the Middle Passage as the essential fact of black identity destroys agency

previously written for Seven Scribes, Paste magazine, and the Toast.

**[[The trajectory of blackness is always forward]{.mark}, up,
away]{.underline}**. On and on, on to the next, next 15 one coming[, [we
shall overcome]{.mark}, move bitch, I'm not gon' stop, I'm not gon' give
up, ain't no mountain high enough, I'mma touch the sky]{.underline}---
**[[blackness doesn't just orient itself toward the future, it
accelerates toward it]{.mark}, fast and furious]{.underline}**. Almost
instinctively, **[[blackness wills itself into an eternal procession
toward inevitably better days, progress
incarnate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Confronting this will, in Physics of
Blackness: Beyond the Middle Passage Epistemology Michelle Wright traces
the trajectory of blackness to its point of origin, profoundly
transforming blackness in the process. Written as a critique of the
metanarrative of blackness, and its tendency to privilege straight,
American black men, the book is necessarily confrontational. Wright
begins by immediately sidestepping the question of what blackness is.
Wright takes the nebulousness of blackness as a given. For her, [[the
question isn't what is blackness: the question is what makes
blackness]{.underline}? [What holds it together]{.underline}]{.mark} [so
that it doesn't seem so nebulous despite stretching out across nations
and centuries and peoples]{.underline}? What are its fundamental forces?
Using physics as a grand metaphor, Wright pinpoints space and time as
the forces underlying blackness, arguing that the geography and
temporality of the Middle Passage fundamentally define blackness. For
Wright, the Middle Passage is treated as the Big Bang of blackness, the
sole point from which blackness expands outward, forming the beautiful
nebulas of blackness that we recognize today. This cosmology of
blackness -- Wright dubs it the "Middle Passage epistemology," following
Annette Henry -- is firmly accepted within black studies and at large,
but Wright isn't a stargazer. In her eyes, the blackness that stems from
the Middle Passage is destructive. Rather than linking black people, it
creates hierarchies that tend to privilege straight black men. The
book's first two chapters confront the Middle Passage epistemology
head-on, using Newtonian physics to explain how and why the Middle
Passage orients blackness by anchoring it to a single event. Newton's
laws of motions, Wright shows, are loaded with assumptions about time
and space, namely that [[time]{.mark} always [moves forward, linearly,
and]{.mark} that [this forward motion is inherently good,
progressive]{.mark}]{.underline}. The notion that time is progressive
preexisted Newton, Wright notes, but the laws of motion naturalized this
assumption, making it fact rather than worldview. Wright highlights how
[[this worldview of constant progress works for blackness]{.mark},
noting that it threads a compelling linear narrative that [moves "from
slavery to rebellions to civil disobedience" in a way that "underscores
Black achievement and drive" and "allows us to]{.mark} cogently and
compellingly [graph the antiprogressive thrust of white Western
politics]{.mark} and practices, all the [while documenting a history of
defiance and]{.mark} collective [uplift]{.mark}."]{.underline} In other
words, "Murder to Excellence" is a damn good story. But is it a story
that we should continue to tell? According to Wright, the answer is no.
**[[Though the Middle Passage epistemology is deeply uplifting]{.mark}
and encouraging, [if it is taken as fact, it has]{.mark} three troubling
[consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline}** First, **[[it undermines
the]{.mark} work of [struggle by]{.mark} making success inevitable
rather than bitterly fought for[, flattening the uphill]{.mark} and
toiling [battle of procuring]{.mark} (and losing) [rights]{.mark} into a
treadmill of fated, easy victories]{.underline}**. Second, [[if the
Middle Passage is the origin of blackness, then from its birth blackness
has never been determined by black people; it is just a]{.mark}n ongoing
[series o]{.mark}f chain [reactions to white racism**. The lack of
agency in such a narrative is condescending at
best**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Finally, and most important for Wright,
[because the Middle Passage tends to prioritize the experiences of
straight black men]{.underline} (e.g., Amistad, 12 Years a Slave,
Roots), [if it is used as the defining event of blackness, the
experiences of black women, LGBTQ black people, and black people from
outside the Americas and the Caribbean are never mentioned]{.underline}.
In other words, there are entire constellations of blackness between
murder and excellence, but when seen through the rigid telescope of the
Middle Passage, they can only be faint blips, trifling cosmic dust. To
counter the Middle Passage epistemology, [Wright turns to quantum
physics, which unites space and time as spacetime and allows spacetime
to curve, bend and stretch in multiple directions]{.underline}. Quantum
physics holds promise for Wright because [[blackness can become
multidimensional, arcing along multiple timelines]{.mark} instead of
one]{.underline}. The solution that emerges from this turn to quantum
physics is "epiphenomenal spacetime," **[[a way of thinking about space
and time]{.mark} in the moment [that moves beyond rigid cause and effect
and considers causes and effects, probabilities and possibilities,
blackness as multitude rather than singularity]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The centerpiece of this quantum blackness is the chapter "Quantum
Baldwin," in which Wright critiques James Baldwin's essay "Encounter on
the Seine." In Baldwin's essay, he roams Paris, coming across the Eiffel
Tower and reflecting on what France variously represents for black
Americans, African immigrants, and white Americans. Rather than finding
common ground with African immigrants, Baldwin sees a 300-year gulf
between black Americans and Africans and shirks away, lonely. The black
American experience is uniquely alienating, he concludes. Wright
challenges Baldwin, criticizing him for using black American men as a
stand-in for all black people, and arguing that [the gulf between
Africans and black Americans only exists if you follow the logic of a
timeline that allows just one narrative of blackness]{.underline}. If
Baldwin had actually spoken with some French African immigrants in
epiphenomenal spacetime, outside of a timeline in which Africans and
black Americans are distant relatives, he could have discovered -- or
created -- other points of proximity: shared education, shared
occupation, shared sexuality (Baldwin was gay), shared alienation from
home. After all, how did he know he was staring across a 300-year gulf?
The French African could have been a second-generation immigrant to
France, or a worker from a Caribbean colony, or even an American tourist
from Louisiana. None of these alternatives are implausible and each
could have complicated Baldwin's encounter on the Seine. But [Baldwin
could never know because he stuck to what he knew, blackness from one
source, one dimension, one trajectory]{.underline}. Wright concludes the
book by detailing some of the black experiences that have been lost
because of the dominance of the Middle Passage epistemology. Slaves that
were traded across the Indian and Pacific Oceans, black soldiers who
fought for the German army in World War II, African women who were
displaced by battles in Africa during World War II, and African
immigrants to Europe and Asia are just a few of the vast collectives of
black people who aren't accounted for by the Middle Passage
epistemology. Many of these groups might not even identify as black, but
perhaps they don't identify as black because they haven't been given a
chance, because their stories are seen as deviations from the timeline
rather than enrichments, footnotes rather than headers. **[[There are
clear benefits to sticking to the]{.mark} familiar, [chanting "We gon'
be alright" and marching forward]{.mark}, a million strong, [propelled
by the jet fuel potential that is blackness]{.mark} -- [forged under
pressure, distilled, refined]{.mark}, flammable, [hurtling
along]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The past and the present often seem to
justify this breakneck speed. [[Slavery, Jim Crow, new slaves, the New
Jim Crow, the Scottsboro Nine, Emmitt Till, the Jena Six , Trayvon
Martin]{.mark}--- [life tends to feel]{.mark} frustratingly [cyclical
for blackness]{.mark}]{.underline}. Accordingly, **[[the speeding
straight arrow of the future holds]{.mark} particular [promise, offering
a chance to slash through the cycles of misery]{.mark} like Alexander
through the Gordian knot]{.underline}**. Perhaps Kanye West puts it most
concisely: "**[[from the bottom so the top's the only place to
g]{.mark}o now."]{.underline}** But what if blackness can be more than a
million black men? Physics of Blackness takes the inherent collectivity
of blackness seriously, embracing a multiverse of black experiences that
includes the descendents of the Middle Passage and all other routes.
**[[This view of blackness transforms it into a relation among people
rather just than]{.mark} a relation to [a fixed point. The trajectory of
blackness can]{.mark} still [be forward, up, and away]{.mark}, but now
it is also across, down, between, through: murder to excellence to
beyond and back]{.underline}**.

### 2AC -- Hope good

#### The belief that reform and progress are [possible]{.underline} is [beneficial]{.underline} and [distinct]{.underline} from the [harmful]{.underline} belief that it's [inevitable]{.underline}\-\--their refusal of the [mere possibility]{.underline} of progress actively constitutes the social as static\-\--it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that locks in white supremacy

\*modified for ableist language that we do not endorse

**[These days]{.underline}**, the [invocation of faith in]{.underline}
the [transformative possibility of]{.underline} self and [society risks
**naiveté**]{.underline}. We live in a time, after all, when the ties
that bind us have badly frayed, when we seem unable to properly regard
the pain of our fellows, and when political leaders seem hell-bent on
exploiting it for gain and to satisfy their own narcissism. [To defend
the role of faith in political struggle may seem odd. Yet, **hear me
out**]{.underline}. Ta-Nehisi Coates's latest book, We Were Eight Years
in Power: An American Tragedy, is his clearest expression yet of
political fatalism---his "deeply held belief that white supremacy was so
foundational to this country that it would not be defeated in my
lifetime, my child\'s lifetime, or perhaps ever." As in Coates's Between
the World and Me (2015), [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} again [[encounter
white supremacy]{.mark} not as a political ideology, but [as the
**defining feature** of the U.S.]{.mark} polity---its **essential
nature**]{.underline}. The book comprises previously published
essays---one for each of the eight years Barack Obama held the
presidency---prefaced by moving biographical and personal meditations
that give each chapter philosophical weight. Taken together, it is about
Obama and the United States---and it is about Coates. It charts the
course of Coates's career from a time when he could not make ends meet
to his recent position of speaking for and to Americans about Black
America. Obama's presidency made this possible; it opened the door for a
"crop of black writers and journalists who achieved prominence during
his two terms." This is also a book about shattering a great
illusion---the idea that Obama's presidency represented black power.
"Obama, his family, and his administration were a walking advertisement
for the ease with which black people could be fully integrated into the
unthreatening mainstream of American culture, politics, and myth. And
that was always the problem." For Coates, Obama represented a
possibility that had always been denied, the idea that a black American
could one day inhabit the highest office of the land. And if a black
American could be president, couldn't the United States be more than the
explicit racism of its past and the institutional racism of its present?
Coates himself was taken by this seductive idea, something he laments
throughout the book. As he explains: It is not so much that I logically
reasoned out that Obama's election would author a post-racist age. But
it now seemed possible that white supremacy, the scourge of American
history might well be banished in my lifetime. In those days I imagined
racism as a tumor that could be isolated and removed from the body of
America, not as a pervasive system both native and essential to that
body. Herein lies the explanation for why a man who curries favor with
white supremacists assumed the presidency after Obama. Donald Trump's
ascendancy was a virulent reaction not only to Obama, but to the idea
that his presidency signaled the country's embrace of a multiracial
polity. [The running theme]{.underline} in Coates's book [is that white
supremacy is native and essential]{.underline}. It is the source of his
motivation. [Coates's goal is to distance]{.underline} both [black
Americans]{.underline} and himself [from thinking of white supremacy as
a focus of transformative politics]{.underline}. And [his theme should
guard against the familiar tendency to deny the national past by
invoking its ever-present commitment to redemption]{.underline}.
Sometimes denial comes in the form of efforts to sanitize history,
Coates tells us, as was the case with Americans seeking to reconcile
themselves to a civil war that was about rights, or railroads, or
tariffs---anything but race. But denial also comes in the form of
believing in "an arc of cosmic justice," the sense "that good acts were
rewarded and bad deeds punished . . . " Coates argues instead that U.S.
history is merely the record of its fundamental nature. Transcendent
stories cannot relieve us of this burden. [[For Coates]{.mark}, the
[desire to transform the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[reflects]{.mark} a [naïve]{.mark}
religious [longing]{.mark}. When Coates tells us]{.underline} that
"[cosmic justice, collective hope, and national redemption" are
meaningless]{.underline} to him, [he is asking black Americans to resist
the temptation to allow those things]{.underline} (which all seem to be
interchangeable throughout the book) [to have meaning for
them]{.underline}. This is his "black atheism." [It removes]{.underline}
the [desire to appeal to white Americans because it removes the belief
that white Americans are "interested listeners]{.underline}" (even if
they are regular readers). In doing so, black Americans arm themselves
against disappointment because they drop their "expectations of white
people . . . " Challenging Coates is difficult, not because of the
assuredness of his analysis, but because of his reputation as "America's
best writer on race." Coates bristles at this reputation, but he has
also embraced his status. He has mastered the balance between speaking
to black pain and suffering (acknowledgement, after all, is so central
to one\'s ethical and political standing in a community otherwise
defined by disregarding black life) and lacerating a class of white
Americans, many of whom perversely see such attacks as moments of
cathartic release. This is as Coates intends. Similar to his affection
for hip-hop music---the way in which he was captured and captivated by
the lyricism of its artists---he seeks to deploy his writings as a
talisman. "Out here," he tells us, "in the concrete and real, sentences
should be supernatural, words strung together until they compelled any
listener to repeat them at odd hours . . . " Coates understands the
power of music, and from his love for it, he crafted his "earliest sense
of what writing should mean." His audience is captured precisely because
his words are incantations that leave them spellbound. But when the
United States selects its eloquent spokesperson on the "race issue"---as
it always does---all other voices become mere noise, and the complexity
of our political traditions and our lived experiences are flattened out.
In Coates's view, for instance, Harriet Tubman, Ida B. Wells, and Martin
Luther King Jr. were all failures. They performed the same script, they
failed to move their audience to action, and they never reshaped U.S.
life and culture. "All of these heroes," Coates insists, "had failed to
cajole and coerce the masters of America." [In Coates's
telling]{.underline}, [fine [historical distinctions disappear]{.mark},
time stands still, and [the **past and future collapse into**]{.mark}
**the political [horrors of the present]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This is
what happens when [we listen only to a single voice]{.mark}; no
conversation is possible. [We are **~~disabled~~\[prevented\] from
speaking**]{.mark} **thoughtfully and [accurately]{.mark}** [about
political]{.mark} and cultural [transformation on racial
matters]{.mark}]{.underline}. But there is a sleight of hand in
[[Coates]{.mark}'s "black atheism]{.underline}"; it [**[conflates hope
with certainty]{.mark}**, and [hope becomes]{.mark} [our fatal
flaw]{.mark}. Yet **[we don't need to believe]{.mark} that [progress is
inevitable]{.mark}** [to think]{.mark} that, through [our
efforts]{.mark}, we [may]{.mark}]{.underline} be able to [[move toward a
more just society]{.underline}. [We **can**]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, [[be sure]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[no good will come
of]{.mark} the [refusal to engage]{.mark} in this work]{.underline}**.
There is much in this that should concern us. Coates describes the pain
visited on black bodies and engenders white guilt. [He erodes the idea
that who we are need not determine who we may become. He obstructs
rather than opens any attempt to reckon with our racial past and present
in the service of an inclusive future]{.underline}. And [he participates
in a politics where words and actions can never aspire to change the
political community]{.underline} in which we live, [and for that reason
they only **fortify our indignation and deepen our
suspicion**]{.underline}---namely, [that as black Americans, we are as
alien to this polity as it is alien to us]{.underline}. The aspiration
to defend a more exalted vision of this country's ethical and political
life is taken as the hallmark of being asleep, dreaming in religious
illusions. To be alive to an unvarnished reality, to be woke, is to
recognize that no such country is possible. [[This runs roughshod
over]{.mark} that thread in the]{.underline} grand [tradition of U.S.
[struggles for justice]{.mark}]{.underline}---a tradition [[in which
**hope and faith are forged through political darkness**]{.mark}. Hope
involves attachment and commitment to the possibility of realizing the
goods we seek. Faith is of a broader significance, providing hope with
content. Faith]{.underline}, the black scholar Anna Julia Cooper
suggested in 1892, [is grounded in a vision of political and ethical
life that is **at odds with the community one inhabits**]{.underline}.
It is a vision that one believes ought to command allegiance, for which
one is willing to fight, and in which one believes others can find a
home. [[Faith looks on the present from]{.mark} the perspective of [a
future vision of society, and uses]{.mark} [the vision]{.mark} as a
resource [to remake the present]{.mark}]{.underline}. And so faith, the
philosopher and psychologist William James explained in 1897, is "the
readiness to act in a cause the prosperous issue of which is not
certified to us in advance." In other words, **[faith has never been
exhausted by the political reality one happens to be living
in]{.underline}**. [Political faith has always rested on the
idea]{.underline} that [we are not finished, a thought that Coates
rejects out of hand]{.underline}. In the nineteenth century, Ralph Waldo
Emerson called this capacity for human renewal "ascension, or the
passage of the soul into higher forms." In our political life this
means, as James Baldwin well knew, that both [[our liberal democratic
institutions and its culture "depends on choices one has got to
make]{.underline}]{.mark}, for ever and ever and ever, [[every
day]{.underline}]{.mark}." [[Faith]{.underline}]{.mark} has always been
a loving but difficult commitment precisely because it [**[makes
politics about maybes rather than certainties]{.mark}**. One of the
greatest dangers of [U.S. exceptionalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, for
instance, [is that it has [habituated us to think about]{.mark} the
structure of [political life as necessarily
progressing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Writing in the wake of the Montgomery
bus boycott---a successful nonviolent campaign against racial
segregation---King sought to chasten the obvious excitement: "Human
progress is neither automatic nor inevitable. [Even a superficial look
at history reveals that no social advance rolls in on the wheels of
inevitability]{.underline}." [Yet [Coates]{.mark} appears
[simply]{.mark} to [**invert U.S. exceptionalism**, replacing it with
the **equally fatalistic idea**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is
fundamentally broken]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In a world [where the good
or bad is fated]{.mark} to happen,]{.underline} **[[faith]{.mark} and
hope [have no foothold]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
[This]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately **[[weakens]{.mark} our
[resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}** and undermines our ability to take
seriously the idea of an "American experiment." [Black activists have
not forged their faith with the stone of U.S.
exceptionalism]{.underline}. Rather, [they have used their darkest hours
to "make a way out of no way"---to address the triple crises
of]{.underline} **[exclusion, domination, and violence]{.underline}**.
Abolitionists such as David Walker faced it in the form of the
enslavement of black folks. Frederick Douglass encountered it with the
rise and crash of reconstruction. Wells faced it as she confronted the
horror of lynching and the disposability of black life. And in our own
time, Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists are reminded of a similar
disposability of black life that goes unpunished. And yet, they are
keepers of the faith, recognizing that its **[vitality is not exhausted
by the reality they struggle against]{.underline}**. In her recent New
York Times article, "Black Lives Matter Is Democracy in Action," Barbara
Ransby narrates [a powerful account of [BLM activists creating contexts
for collective leadership]{.mark} and using those opportunities
[to]{.mark} transform the power of voice into actions that [meet]{.mark}
the [needs of ordinary people]{.mark}]{.underline}. This effort [[would
be **impossible for people who accept Coates's
perspective**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Their efforts may not win the day,
but they certainly won't win the day without the faith that winning is a
possibility. [[Faith does not deny the present, but **refuses to be
defined by it**]{.mark} **and sink into it**. We now face a president
who seeks to colonize every waking moment of our lives with feelings of
dread]{.underline}, thus arresting our ability to imagine a reality
beyond television, social media feeds, and newspapers. **[The [illusion
of our present]{.mark} moment [is not expressed in]{.mark} political
[faith, but in the belief]{.mark} that [we can respond constructively
without]{.mark} such [faith]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Political faith
is]{.mark} **fully [realistic about]{.mark} the [present
disasters]{.mark}** [and **rejects illusions about assured**]{.mark}
**future [progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [while **also**
insisting]{.underline}]{.mark} [that [we are not certain to
fail]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is hopeful without being
optimistic]{.underline}. [We may falter,]{.underline} and the material,
psychological, and political goods of [white supremacy may deplete our
desire to transform. We know the history]{.underline}---from the 1880s
to the 1960s---[of white backlash in response to a more expansive racial
justice]{.underline}. In fact, we are living through one such backlash
given the ascendancy of Trump. [But our [political community is what it
is because we have made it]{.mark} this way. [It is not fated]{.mark} to
be]{.underline}. [**[Believing otherwise makes white supremacy something
more]{.mark}** than a collection of choices, habits, and
**[practices]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[it makes it **part of human
nature**]{.underline}]{.mark} itself. Coates wants us to face the facts
and embrace black atheism. But throughout the book he often slides from
working in the historical register to speaking in the idiom of
philosophical metaphysics---at one moment he stands in time and at
another he stands outside of it, confidently telling us how history will
end. For this reason, [[Coates doesn\'t **dismantle white supremacy**;
he]{.mark} **ironically [provides it]{.mark} with
[support]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Please understand my concern. Coates is
right: he doesn't have a "responsibility to be hopeful or optimistic or
make anyone feel better about the world." [We must]{.underline}, as he
has often done, [**speak the truth**. But we must not claim to know what
we cannot possibly know.]{.underline} **[Humility creates space for
hope]{.underline}**. This is why James Baldwin remains so helpful and
why his work is ubiquitous these days. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, he insisted, [is a collection of
choices]{.underline}. And precisely for this reason, we must learn how
to let go of former identities as we quest after better ones. He was not
a political strategist, but a keen observer and analyst of U.S.
political and ethical culture and in this regard, his writings are
directed to cultivating a new orientation. Baldwin's insight for us was
that we find it challenging to live together precisely because we have
not always understood what it means to allow features of ourselves to
perish. In depicting our many selves, Baldwin reduces the burden of
letting go. **[If there is only one self at stake]{.underline}**, as
Coates believes, [if white supremacy is the country's only identity,
then letting go is entering an abyss]{.underline}.

[Perhaps]{.underline}, as so many tell us, [[the sun is setting
on]{.mark} the [U.S. empire]{.mark}]{.underline}. The death of an empire
is nothing to lament, tied as intimately as empires are to death and
destruction. [But [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is **not only an empire**]{.mark}. Its
[liberal democratic tendencies]{.mark} run deep and [have often been
used]{.mark} **not merely for good, but [to bring about]{.mark} the
[good as it relates to racial equality]{.mark}**[. As]{.mark} the
[empire dies, why should we **abandon the idea**]{.mark} **that
[something new may yet be born?]{.mark}** What [we must]{.mark}
ask]{.underline} ourselves now, is what in our past might we retrieve
for our present, [how might those resources be reimagined to
[articulate]{.mark} a [political faith]{.mark} [more]{.mark} humane and
[just than]{.mark} the [reality]{.mark} we find ourselves living,
[and]{.mark} how might we [allow **portions of ourselves to
die**]{.mark} **with grace [so that we might flourish with
dignity?]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Answering]{.mark} these questions
**[begins with denying]{.mark} that the story of [who we are is]{.mark}
simple and [settled]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

for the jail expansion, [we confronted the challenge of sustaining our
movement.]{.underline} I learned that our [in[ability to sustain
antiracist struggles is]{.mark} often [linked to]{.mark} the [ways we
**frame**]{.mark} **our [organizing visions]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[[People]{.mark} often [join]{.mark} a struggle [because they believe
in]{.mark} fighting for [a specific cause]{.mark}]{.underline} (to stop
the jail expansion, to stop the drones, to stop racist policing).
[[When]{.mark} their [cause suffers]{.mark} losses because state
representatives engage in the normative business of refusing them
recognition, [activists]{.mark} often [experience]{.mark} **emotional
exhaustion** and **[defeat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They **become
skeptical** that organizing efforts make a difference]{.underline}.

Our focus on winning specific campaigns rather than creating sustained
and sustaining antiracist praxis sometimes misguides our organizing.
[[Every]{.mark} campaign [win can]{.mark} later [be]{.mark}come
[appropriated]{.mark} to produce injustice]{.underline}. Take, for
example, the feminist movement's victory to grant legal recognition to
gender specific issues in prisons. This victory is now being used by the
state to argue for expanding "gender-responsive" prisons, perpetuating
logics that expand mass incarceration instead of imagining other
possibilities for redress and accountability. [[Strategic adjustments by
the state]{.mark}, antagonistic political forces, and numerous other
factors [create]{.mark} the [chaos]{.mark} in which we
work]{.underline}. I learned again that **[[justice is not]{.mark} a
[static]{.mark} thing we achieve once and for all]{.underline}**.
[[It]{.mark} is something that [has to be persistently struggled for on
the basis of shared principles]{.mark} as conditions
change]{.underline}.

[Those who see themselves on a lifelong journey to uphold principles of
justice and to build life-sustaining outcomes eventually understand that
**[victories can become losses]{.mark}** and that losses can galvanize
movements.]{.underline} I learned from my cocreators in the SGWG that
[[the point is]{.mark} simply to struggle for justice, honesty, respect,
integrity, and love]{.underline}. **[[We struggle because we find white
supremacy intolerable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [We struggle because we
find [U.S. warfare, mass incarceration, and immigrant detention
**unjustifiable**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [We struggle because we see how
gender and sexual violence destroys families and communities. [We
struggle because we cannot accept]{.mark} the ways [economic
inequalities]{.mark} limit impoverished people's creative power and
potential.]{.underline} [These were the shared principles and feelings
that sustained our commitments to organizing]{.underline}.

[[People call us fools]{.mark}. Pragmatists call us [naïve]{.mark}.
Skeptics [laugh at us]{.mark}. [But we are]{.mark} comforted and
[motivated by the fact that]{.mark}, at the very least, [we]{.mark} try
to [abide by our principles]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[We do this
imperfectly and]{.mark} always [incompletely]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[[When we try not to engage]{.mark} in the labor of [hatred]{.mark},
denial, disavowal, guilt, and projection; [when we reveal]{.mark} the
[lies repeated by white]{.mark} heteropatriarchal
[supremacy]{.mark}]{.underline}

[; [when we do not reject]{.mark} the fact [that we are all complicit in
systems of]{.mark} denigration and [destruction]{.mark} in some way;
[when we do not shy away]{.mark} from our social and political
[responsibility to end oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}---[that is when
[the process of struggling for justice begins to offer]{.mark} an
unchartered sense of [liberation]{.mark}, an unlegislated experience of
freedom, and a mutually interdependent place to belong.]{.underline}

### 1AR -- Hope good 

#### Our hope is distinct from a faith in inevitable progress. The embrace of hope is especially important for [people of color]{.underline} -- that is not equivalent to white optimism, but we think we can take productive moves to improve the world.

**Leonardo '11** (Zeus, Prof. of Cultural Studies @ Graduate School of
Education, U. of California, Berkeley, "After the Glow: Race ambivalence
and other educational prognoses," Educational Philosophy and Theory,
Vol. 43.6, pp. 693-695)

Ultimately, a post-race perspective enables educators to distinguish
between hope and optimism. Whereas color-blindness is usually associated
with a white mindset or lived experience, post-race is a theory of
color, which does not mean that scholars of color are always its author.
A bright student of mine once suggested that 'hope is white'.8 By this
she meant that whites exhibit an abundance of hope concerning racial
progress when compared to a rather pessimistic black prognosis of the
same problem. I took it to mean that even hope is racial and subject to
its rationality. It struck me as insightful and I would like to end this
essay with a commentary on hope and optimism. I would refine the insight
this way: [while whites are optimistic about race they are not hopeful,
whereas [people of color are]{.mark} precisely the opposite, **[hopeful
but pessimistic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When it comes to race progress,
whites show much optimism because small increments of improvement are
taken as signs of white tolerance. It produces the psychological
advantage of focusing on 'how far we have come' instead of the more
loaded 'how far we still have to go'. For if whites compare present
inequalities with past cruelties, not only do black lives look that much
better but white tolerance looks that much greater. Whereas Gramsci
(1971) once distinguished between the 'pessimism of the intellect and
the optimism of the will', whites show an optimism of the intellect and
pessimism of the will. In short, **[[we cannot equate white optimism
with real hope,]{.mark} which takes a certain will that whites have
shown themselves to lack]{.underline}**. They are prone to exaggerate
racial progress because focusing on the continuing significance of
racism indicts their collective inability to end the problem once and
for all. They feel good without necessarily having to make good. [For
all the optimism they express toward racial progress, they lack hope in
its actional sense]{.underline}. For whites, hope is abstract. This is
hardly post-racial. **[In contrast, [if people of color]{.mark} have
[represented anything]{.mark} in the history of race relations, [it is
hope]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [It is one of the few 'advantages' that
people of color have over whites. **[Hope is built into the experience
of people of color as an ontological part of their
being]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Freire, 1993). [How else does one
explain their ability to withstand centuries of racial oppression? It is
premised on the hope that it will one day end despite the fact that they
are disappointed by whites' ability to converge racial progress with
their own interests]{.underline} (Bell, 1992). **[Time and time again,
people of color cling on to [hope]{.mark} as the force that [prevents
them from despair and resignation. It is historical and allows them to
see setbacks as opportunities for defiance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
fact, they project hope onto whites more than they sometimes deserve, a
surplus hopefulness that whites underappreciate because they would
rather emphasize people of color's animosity over their grace. We have
seen Barack Obama's campaign was built on the audacity of hope and
Reverend Jesse Jackson's battlecry was 'keep hope alive'. Even Derrick
Bell's apparent bleakness is contradicted by his early endorsement of
Obama for president, as evidenced by his public support of him many
months preceding Obama's victory over his then favored opponent, Senator
Clinton.9 Hope is what propelled Bell to support change. As Obama
accepts his Nobel Peace Prize, we recognize that it was made possible by
his going to war with a unilateral decision-making process turned into a
science by eight years under the Bush regime. As a concrete possibility,
peace will be approached by people of color through a critical, honest
appraisal of racialization. Their hope attenuates the otherwise
realistic pessimism they feel about race relations, which may keep them
bitter. **[A language of hope is concrete for people of color because
[it is not just a projected ideal but a way to exist in the
present]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [It is a dream, not a fantasy. It is not
an abstract feeling but a concrete emotion, or better yet, an emotional
praxis]{.underline} (Chubbuck & Zembylas, 2008).

### 2AC -- reformism good

#### [The aff is effective]{.underline} in the interim and brings revolutionary change closer rather than pushing it away---this should frame your ballot 

Richard **Delgado 9**, self-appointed Minority scholar, Chair of Law at
the University of Alabama Law School, J.D. from the University of
California, Berkeley, his books have won eight national book prizes,
including six Gustavus Myers awards for outstanding book on human rights
in North America, the American Library Association's Outstanding
Academic Book, and a Pulitzer Prize nomination. Professor Delgado's
teaching and writing focus on race, the legal profession, and social
change, 2009, "Does Critical Legal Studies Have What Minorities Want,
Arguing about Law", p. 588-590

The [CLS critique of piecemeal reform]{.underline}¶ [Critical scholars
reject the idea of piecemeal reform. [Incremental change, they
argue,]{.mark} merely postpones]{.underline} the [wholesale reformation
that must occur to create a decent society]{.underline}. Even worse[,
[an unfair]{.mark} social [system survives by using piecemeal reform
to]{.mark} disguise and [legitimize oppression]{.mark}. Those who
control the system weaken resistance by pointing to the occasional
concession to]{.underline}, or periodic court [victory of, a black
plaintiff or worker as evidence that the system is fair]{.underline}
and¶ just. In fact, Crits believe that teaching the¶ common law or using
the case method in law school is a disguised means of preaching
incrementalism and thereby maintaining the current power structure." To
avoid this, CLS scholars¶ urge law professors to abandon the case
method, give up the effort to ﬁnd rationality and order¶ in the case
law, and teach in an unabashedly political fashion.¶
**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** CLS [**[critique of]{.mark} piecemeal
[reform is]{.mark} familiar, [imperialistic and
wrong]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Minorities know from bitter experience
that occasional court victories do not mean the Promised Land is at
hand[. [The]{.mark}]{.underline} [[critique]{.underline}]{.mark} is
imperialistic in that it [[tells minorities]{.mark} and other oppressed
peoples [how they should interpret events affecting them. A court order
directing]{.mark} a housing [authority to disburse funds for heating
in]{.mark} subsidized [housing may postpone the revolution, **or it may
not**. In the meantime, the order keeps]{.mark} a number of poor
[families warm]{.mark}. This may mean more to them than it does to a
comfortable academic working in a warm office. [It s]{.mark}macks of
[paternalism to assert that the possibility of revolution later
outweighs]{.mark} the certainty of heat now]{.underline},¶ unless there
is evidence for that possibility. The [Crits do not offer]{.underline}
such [evidence. Indeed,]{.underline} some [**[incremental changes may
bring revolutionary changes closer]{.mark}**, not push them further
away. Not all small reforms induce complacency; [some]{.mark} may [whet
the appetite]{.mark} for further combat. The welfare family may hold a
tenants' union meeting in their heated living room]{.underline}. CLS
[scholars' critique of piecemeal reform often misses these
possibilities, and neglects the question of whether total change, when
it comes, will be what we want.]{.underline}

#### Reformism key to check anti-blackness -- society is always in flux and policy helps shapes societal norms 

Eddie **Glaude 16**, Professor of African American Studies and Religion
at Princeton, "Democracy in Black: How Race Still Enslaves"

[But Goldwater failed to realize that **[governmental
indifference]{.mark} can harden hearts, [and]{.mark} government
[action]{.mark} [can create conditions that soften them]{.mark}.
[People\'s attitudes aren\'t static or untouchable]{.mark}. They are
molded by the quality of interactions with others, and one of the great
powers of government involves shaping those interactions-not determining
them in any concrete sense, but defining the parameters within which
people come to know each other and live together.**]{.underline} Today,
for example, most Americans don\'t believe women should be confined to
the home raising children, or subjected to crude advances and sexist
remarks by men. The women\'s-rights movement put pressure on the
government, which in turn passed laws that helped change some of our
beliefs about women. Similarly, the relative progress of the 1960s did
not happen merely by using the blunt instruments of the law. [[Change
emerged from the ways those laws, with grassroots pressure, created new
patterns of interactions, and ultimately new
habits]{.mark}.]{.underline} Neither Obama\'s election to the presidency
nor my appointment as a Princeton professor would have happened were it
not for these new patterns and habits. None of this happens overnight.
[It takes time and increasing vigilance to protect and secure
change.]{.underline} I was talking with a dose friend and he mentioned a
basic fact: that we were only fifteen years removed from the passage of
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 when Ronald Reagan was elected president
and Republicans began to dismantle the gains of the black freedom
struggle. [[Civil rights legislation]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
policies of [the Great Society]{.mark} [had just started to reshape our
interactions]{.mark} when they started to be rolled back. We barely had
a chance to imagine America anew-to pursue what full employment might
look like, to let the abolition of the death penalty settle in, to
question seriously the morality of putting people in prison cells, and
to enact policies that would undo what the 1968 Kerner Commission
described as \"two Americas\"¬ before the attack on \"big government\"
or, more precisely, [the attack on racial equality was
launched]{.mark}.]{.underline} The objective was to shrink the size of
government (\"to starve the beast\") and to limit its domestic
responsibilities to ensuring economic efficiency and national defense.
Democrats eventually buckled, and this is the view of government, no
matter who is in office, that we have today. It has become a kind of
touchstone of faith among most Americans that government is wasteful and
should be limited in its role-that it shouldn\'t intrude on our lives.
Politicians aren\'t the only ones who hold this view. Many Americans do,
too. Now we can\'t even imagine serious talk of things like full
employment or the abolition of prisons. [We have to change our view of
government, especially when it comes to racial matters. [Government
policy ensured the vote]{.mark} [for African Americans and dismantled
legal segregation]{.mark}. Policy established a social safety net for
the poor and elderly; it put in place the conditions for the growth of
our cities. All of this didn\'t happen simply because of individual will
or thanks to some abstract idea of America. It was tied up with our
demands and expectations.]{.underline} Goldwater was wrong. So was
Reagan. And, in many ways, so is Obama. **[[Our racial habits are shaped
by the kind of society in which we live, and our government plays a big
role in shaping that society]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As young children,
our community offers us a way of seeing the world; it lets us know what
is valuable and sacred, and what stands as virtuous behavior and what
does not. When Michael Brown\'s body was left in the street for more
than four hours, it sent a dear message about the value of black lives.
[When everything in our society says that we should be less concerned
about black folk, that they are dangerous, that no specific policies can
address their misery, we say to our children and to everyone else that
these people are \"less than\"-that they fall outside of our moral
concern.]{.underline} We say, without using the word, that they are
niggers. [One way to change that view is to enact policies that suggest
otherwise. Or, to put it another way, [to change our view of government,
we must change our demands of government]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
For example, for the past fifty years African American unemployment has
been twice that of white unemployment. The 2013 unemployment rate for
African Americans stood at 13.1 percent, the highest annual black
unemployment rate in more than seventy years. Social scientists do not
generally agree on the causes of this trend. Some attribute it to the
fact that African Americans are typically the \"last hired and first
fired.\" Others point to changes in the nature of the economy; still
others point to overt racial discrimination in the labor market. No
matter how we account for the numbers, the fact remains that most
Americans see double-digit black unemployment as \"normal.\" However, a
large-scale, comprehensive jobs agenda with a living wage designed to
put Americans, and explicitly African Americans, to work would go a long
way toward uprooting the racial habits that inform such a view. It would
counter the nonsense that currently stands as a reason for long-term
black unemployment in public debate: black folk are lazy and don\'t want
to work. [If we hold the view that government plays a crucial role in
ensuring the public good-if we believe that all Americans, no matter
their race or class, can be vital contributors to our beloved
community-then we reject the idea that some populations are disposable,
that some people can languish in the shadows while the rest of us dance
in the light.]{.underline} The question \'\'Am I my brother\'s or my
sister\'s keeper?\" is not just a question for the individual or a
mantra to motivate the private sector. It is a question answered in the
social arrangements that aim to secure the goods and values we most
cherish as a community. In other words, we need an idea of government
that reflects the value of all Americans, not just white Americans or a
few people with a lot of money. [[We need]{.mark} [government seriously
committed to racial justice]{.mark}. As a nation, we can never pat
ourselves on the back about racial matters.]{.underline} We have too
much blood on our hands. Remembering that fact-our inheritance, as
Wendell Berry said-does not amount to beating ourselves over the head,
or wallowing in guilt, or trading in race cards. Remembering our
national sins serves as a check and balance against national hubris.
We\'re reminded of what we are capable of, and our eyes are trained to
see that ugliness when it rears its head. But when we disremember-when
we forget about the horrors of lynching, lose sight of how African
Americans were locked into a dual labor market because of explicit
racism, or ignore how we exported our racism around the world-we free
ourselves from any sense of accountability. Concern for others and a
sense of responsibility for the whole no longer matter. Cruelty and
indifference become our calling cards. We have to isolate those areas in
which long-standing trends of racial inequality short-circuit the life
chances of African Americans. [In addition to a jobs agenda, **[we need
a comprehensive]{.mark} [government response]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
problems of public education and [mass incarceration]{.mark}**. And I do
mean a government response. Private interests have overrun both areas,
as privatization drives school reform (and the education of our children
is lost in the boisterous battles between teachers\' unions and private
interests) and as big business makes enormous profits from the
warehousing of black and brown people in prisons. Let\'s be clear:
private interests or market-based strategies will not solve the problems
we face as a country or bring about the kind of society we need. **[We
have to push for massive]{.mark} [government investment in early
childhood education and in shifting the center of gravity of our society
from punishment to restorative justice]{.mark}**.]{.underline} We can
begin to enact the latter reform by putting an end to the practice of
jailing children. Full stop. We didn\'t jail children in the past. We
don\'t need to now. In sum, government can help us go a long way toward
uprooting racial habits with policies that support jobs with a living
wage, which would help wipe out the historic double-digit gap between
white and black unemployment; take an expansive approach to early
childhood education, which social science research consistently says
profoundly affects the life chances of black children; and dismantle the
prison-industrial complex. We can no longer believe that
disproportionately locking up black men and women constitutes an answer
to social ills. [This view of government cannot be dismissed as a naive
pipe dream, because political considerations relentlessly attack our
political imaginations and limit us to the status quo.]{.underline} We
are told before we even open our mouths that this particular view won\'t
work or that it will never see the light of day. We\'ve heard enough of
that around single payer health care reform and other progressive
policies over the Obama years. Such defeatist attitudes conspire to
limit our imaginations and make sure that the world stays as it is.
**[But those of us who don\'t give a damn about the rules of the current
political game must courageously [organize]{.mark}, [advocate]{.mark},
and [insist]{.mark} [on the moral and political significanc]{.mark}e of
a more robust role for government. [We have to change the terms of
political debate]{.mark}. Something dramatic has to happen. American
democracy has to be remade.]{.underline}** John Dewey, the American
philosopher, understood this: The very idea of democracy, the meaning of
democracy, must be continually explored afresh; it has to be constantly
discovered and rediscovered, remade and reorganized; while the political
and economic and social institutions in which it is embodied have to be
remade and reorganized to meet the changes that are going on in the
development of new needs on the part of human beings and new resources
for satisfying these needs. Dewey saw American democracy as an
unfinished project. He knew that the aims and purposes of this country
were not fixed forever in the founding documents, but the particular
challenges of our moment required imaginative leaps on behalf of
democracy itself[. Otherwise, undemocratic forces might prevail; tyranny
in the form of the almighty dollar and the relentless pursuit of it
might overtake any commitment to the idea of the public good; and bad
habits might diminish our moral imaginations.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- cruel optimism bad

#### Their appeal to 'cruel optimism' is a [capitalist ploy]{.underline} to [naturalize oppression]{.underline}. A future oriented frame is necessary to challenge structural violence.

Optimism: Duty or Cruelty?

More recently, further [objections have been made within]{.underline}
queer and [affect theory]{.underline} in particular [to the
normativizing tendencies]{.underline} inherent [in politics]{.underline}
in general: [perhaps political optimism or revolutionary hope are simply
ways of interpellating]{.underline} queer [subjects into compulsory
affective circuits in which \"negative\" feelings and emotions must be
renounced in the name of \"positive\" ones]{.underline}, or into certain
hetero- or homonormative visions of the \"good life\" that is to be
sought in revolutionary movements. Such a process, according to some
queer theorists, thus installs a form of affective normativily into
politics, which demands certain investments and obscures the
distribution of \"positive\" and \"negative\" feelings across gender,
sexual, racial, class, and national axes (see Duggan and Munoz 2009 and
Berlant 2011). [As such]{.underline}, much [recent]{.underline} queer
[theory has drawn on]{.underline} certain forms of [psychoanalysis to
advocate the]{.underline} political [use-value of]{.underline} precisely
[these \"negative\"]{.underline} and \"non-normative\" [affects and
feelings---including hopelessness, melancholia, shame, unhappiness---in
the name of]{.underline} queer [resistance]{.underline} (see Eng and
Kazanjian 2002, Duggan and Munoz 2009, Ahmed 2010, Halperin and Traub
2010). In its most extreme form (which we take up extensively in Chapter
3). queer theorist Lee [Edelman]{.underline} (2004) has
[argued]{.underline} that any politics whatsoever is always already both
heteronormative and conservative insofar as it imagines \"the Child\" as
the horizon and beneficiary of any political action. The [focus on the
future inherent to any political agenda]{.underline}, according to
Edelman, [involves a compulsory renunciation of the present in the name
of the children]{.underline} who will inherit that \"better\" future.
[Queers are, according to Edelman]{.underline}, those not fighting for
the children and are thus [figured as the death drive of the social
order]{.underline}---a status Edelman forcefully exhorts queers to
actively take up in the \"insistence that the future stop here\" (2004:
31).

[So does all of this mean that we are, to use]{.underline} Lauren
[Berlant\'s]{.underline} (2011) [term, \"cruel
optimists\"?]{.underline}3 [We would answer this simply: [there
is]{.mark} surely [**nothing crueler** than to say]{.mark} that [there
is no way out of the **horrific**]{.mark} **and brutal
[exploitation]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} advanced [**capitalism** that leaves
the]{.mark} majority of the [world]{.mark}\'s population [in]{.mark}
conditions of **[dire poverty]{.mark}** and [targeted for
**extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Embracing the death drive, or what
amounts to the same thing, [**abandoning oneself** to the impending doom
of]{.mark} the species and [the planet]{.mark} when you have no
possibility of life is not such a big deal, and [is]{.mark} **certainly
[not]{.mark}** an act of]{.underline} \"queer\" or \"posthumanist\"
[[resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Centuries ago, Immanuel Kant argued
that [[**we have a duty to be optimistic**, not because things]{.mark}
are [necessarily]{.mark} going to [get better, but **because
they might**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Kant, [[we are **not obligated**
to believe in any particular]{.mark} vision of the [future]{.mark} or
its possibility, [but]{.mark} the fact [that ideals such
as]{.mark}]{.underline} perpetual peace ([and]{.underline} we would add:
[[the **end of capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[**cannot be proven
impossible** **obliges** us to **live as if**]{.mark}** (not necessarily
believe) [they were]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To quote Kant:

> [for there can be no obligation \... to believe]{.underline} something
> \[i.e., [a specific end]{.underline}\]. [What is incumbent upon us as
> a duty is to **act in conformity with the idea of that end**, **even
> if** there is not the slightest theoretical likelihood that it can be
> realized, as long as its impossibility cannot be demonstrated
> either]{.underline}. Now morally practical reason pronounces in us its
> irresistible veto: there is to be no war\... [So the question is no
> longer whether perpetual peace is something real or a fiction, and
> whether we are not deceiving ourselves in our theoretical judgment
> when we assume that it is real]{.underline}. [Instead we must act as
> if it is something real, though perhaps it is not]{.underline}\...
> [and even if the complete realization of this objective always remains
> a pious wish, still we are certainly not deceiving ourselves in
> adopting the maxim of working incessantly toward it]{.underline}. [For
> this is our duty]{.underline} \... (1996: 490-1, emphasis added)

And, moreover, [[as spectators]{.mark} ([if not participants]{.mark}) in
revolutionary struggle, [we]{.mark} **actually [shape]{.mark}** the way
those [struggles]{.mark} will be read]{.underline}. So for Kant, [the
spectators who cheered on the French Revolution played a role in history
in that the significance they gave to that revolution became part of the
new reality that that revolution constituted]{.underline}. [And cannot
the same be said for those who cheered on the \"Arab Spring,\" as well
as those who heroically participated in it?]{.underline} Can it not be
said of those who stayed up all night watching the votes be counted in
recent elections in Greece, Spain, and South Africa to see if new
socialist parties would be voted in? [[The **deep irony** of]{.mark}
much [recent]{.mark}]{.underline} feminist and queer [[theory is that
it]{.mark} effectively [tells us that]{.mark}, in the name
of]{.underline} \"queerness\" and [\"posthumanism,\" **[everything
must]{.mark} ultimately [remain exactly as it is]{.mark}**[, given that
the hope for a different future is]{.mark}]{.underline} heteronormative
and any idea of transforming the world [[is humanist delirium; that we
should instead embrace]{.mark} ephemerality, [extinction]{.mark}, and
the death drive (all of [which **capitalism**]{.mark} **has
[conveniently made]{.mark} readily [available]{.mark}**); [and that
anyone who]{.mark} writes or [claims otherwise is]{.mark} nothing but a
[nostalgic]{.mark}, humanist fool [providing]{.mark}]{.underline}
deluded idiots with [[cruel optimism]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[How do
these thinkers know that we are fated to fragility, death, extinction,
poverty, war, capitalism, depression, melancholia, and unbearable
sex?]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 2AC -- Barlow 

#### The alts literature base is wrong - it's too totalizing and fails to articulate material methods of implementation - [they can't solve]{.underline}.

\[BK\]

[Any exploration of Afro-Pessimism must begin with an exploration of the
Middle Passage. [The Middle Passage is often]{.mark} [conflated with the
Transatlantic Slave Trade]{.mark} which is understood as the economic
exchange of goods for slaves. [While]{.mark} [it is true that the Middle
Passage is primarily concerned with the advent of Chattel Slavery, it is
a reductionist view to attribute the system of Black production to that
singular point in time]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[There were other avenues
for slave trade]{.mark} that [existed as well]{.mark}, and as such, [it
is more productive to have an epistemic orientation that understands the
Middle Passage's beginning at the metaphysical desires for Black
flesh]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The beginning of the Middle Passage must
not be when the African got onto the ship, but rather when those in
power began to imagine the flesh. Any other theorization would omit the
symbolic conceptions that inspired European exploitation of the flesh,
and those exploits are what continue the drive for Black violence
today]{.underline}. White people operated on libidinal conceptions of
the African long before there ever existed a slave. The libido is a
concept most relevant in the field of psychoanalysis which studies and
attempts to map the unconscious mind. It influences and shapes the basis
for sexual desire as a pursuit of power. [The libidinal economy then is
an organization of signs and symbols at the level of the metaphysical
that originate from a sexualized need for control. Simply put, the
libidinal economy can be understood as an intersection between sexual
desire and domination.]{.underline} In terms of Africa, "White violence
against the black body was compelled by a complex mixture of conscious
identification, unconscious fears, and subconscious longings" (Tibbs and
Woods 2008). Evidence of this is at the first European interaction with
the African. [Their first recorded observations of the Africans were not
of their culture, but rather they were imaginations of the alleged
African sexual bestiality]{.underline} (L-SAW 2010). Thus, the African
became known by a bestial and sexual rubric within the white mind, and
that shaped further interactions. Evidence of white libidinal [desires
to control and possess the African are also in the lines of demarcation
drawn between the civilizations]{.underline}. The very basis of racial
slavery began "...with desire for the symbols of purity, honor, and
humanity represented by whiteness and made possible by blackness and for
the pleasure, exoticism, and self-loathing epitomized by blackness as
constructed in opposition to whiteness (Tibbs and Woods 2008)." This is
the organization of those metaphysical curiosities that fueled the
projection of sexual representations onto the flesh. This libidinal
construction is how African breasts and buttocks came to be represented
as sexually abnormal, and in turn, it is ultimately what led to the
construction of the Black woman as sexually insatiable. [This was the
basis for the white libidinal imagination to set the stage for a type a
slavery previously unknown to the world: racial slavery.]{.underline}
The Middle Passage created a grammar of suffering that transformed an
entire race of people into a commodity of sexualized objects. In the
creation of the Black, there was no requirement for contravention in a
political or economic sense. In the white mind, the very existence of
the Black was an act of social contravention. For the first time, even
"...prior to the contingency of the 'transgressive act' (such as losing
a war or being convicted of a crime)," an entire body of people became
permanently natural slaves (Wilderson 2010). The African was now
identified as Black and came to be known in the world by a metric of
slaveness which was understood to be a mere enforcement of the natural
order of the universe. This was justified in the varying accumulations
of white representations written onto Black bodies grounded in the
inherent white desire to control and manipulate the flesh. The new era
of racial slavery would become a substantial indicator of Black
positionality throughout the world. The Middle Passage destroyed the
cultural, social, and political remnants of what was once the African
and forged it into a walking symbiosis of what was now Black. In this
regard, racial slavery was like no other. Even in the case of the
holocaust, "Jews went into Auschwitz and came out as Jews. Africans went
into the ships and came out as Blacks...That is why it makes little
sense to attempt analogy: the Jews have the Dead (the Muselmenn) among
them; the Dead have the Blacks among them" (Wilderson 2010). The African
went into the Middle Passage having a specific geographical home, a
specific native language, and a specific faith, but she came out as
Black[. [This is not to say that Black bodies lost everything on the
slave ship,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[but rather the history of its
existence is one that was deprived at the hands of the slave
master]{.mark}. The traces of cultural fragments that managed to survive
were subsequently demonized and degraded. This argument is not to prove
that there is no Black history, but]{.underline} [[that Black history
exists in a state of oscillation. It is simultaneously there and not
there]{.mark}. As a method of keeping the slaves divided, the slave
master would prevent the slaves from practicing indigenous religious and
cultural traditions]{.underline}. Generally, "every effort conceivable
was made to destroy all vestiges of what might endure as African social
consciousness. \[This country\] was founded on the systematic,
conscientious, and massive destruction of African cultural remnants"
(Mayer 2000). This is why Blackness is that which can only be defined as
in the context of absence.

The Problem with Social Death Applications. While the ontological state
of Black social death is an important concept for resistance scholars to
understand, the typical **[[advocacy of complete]{.mark} societal
[pessimism in response to]{.mark} that [ontological arrangement is
incomplete]{.mark} at best. Many in Afro-Pessimism use the basis of
social death to determine the question of Black political orientation in
a way that is problematic.]{.underline}** This is not to say that social
death theorization is not important, but that there is a vital
distinction that needs to be made both in terms of its application
toward traditional political processes and ensembles of Blackness. Frank
**[Wilderson]{.underline}**, Associated Professor of African-American
Studies and Drama at the University of California-Irvine, is quite
possibly the leading Afro-Pessimist scholar. He **[concludes his
discussion of social death by advocating for one to "embrace its
disorder,]{.underline}** its incoherence, and allow oneself to be
elabo­rated by it if, indeed, ones politics are to be underwritten by a
desire **[to take down this country]{.underline}**" (2007). In summary,
**[his application of [social death is used as a reason why Black life
cannot be oriented at any level of meaningful production within society.
While Wilderson is correct that]{.mark} the material labor and symbolic
[currency born out of Blackness will always be consumed by whiteness,
his conclusion is paradoxical]{.mark} at some level. [If
humanism]{.mark} is the grammar by which civil society
[determines]{.mark} the register of [subjectivity, why then is that
matrix appropriate in determining the state of Black
life]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if Black life is inherently the position of
what is incommunicable? If social death theory's application is one that
concludes an impossibility of meaningful Black productivity, then
**[[Afro-Pessimism becomes nothing but]{.mark} a body of literature that
[echoes the same sentiments as those who would understand Black
life]{.mark} as a state of nothingness [in plain racist
terms]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Understanding **[[Black ontology]{.mark}
should definitely involve an understanding of the social deadness of the
Black subject in relation to society, but it [should not be used as the
standard to measure internal liberation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
distinction here is important because too often Afro-Pessimists scholars
like Wilderson conceptualize Black resistance as a singular orientation
toward society. Indeed **[[their work is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
important to understand the manner in which society operates upon Black
subjects, but it is **[[insufficient to describe an ethic that allows
for the pursuit of meaning within Blackness
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this regard, **[scholars should
understand Black resistance as occurring on two different levels: the
ontological and the intra-ontological. The distinction being made is
between the ontological state of Blackness as determined outside of
humanity proper versus the life within the ontological state of
Blackness]{.underline}** as understood through social death. If social
death is the state of the Black, what then speaks to the state of the
Black amongst Blacks? It would be a mistake on the part of any scholar
to concern themselves with one and not the other. **[This paper uses the
term intra-ontology in reference to the varying ontologies within social
death. This is the Black among Blacks.]{.underline}** These are those
spaces within Blackness that only the Black can ever understand or
occupy. **[Though they exist outside of the production of the
human]{.underline}** (within the category of social death), **[[there
are Black affektual politics that have been with the slave]{.mark} since
the ship. [These are the emotional and spiritual ontologies within
Blackness that connected slaves]{.mark}]{.underline}** of different
lands, languages, and religions into one community**[. Black
intra-ontology can never achieve the plane of recognition because it can
only be understood within Blackness]{.underline}**, which by definition
is the position of social death, **[but those affektual spirits and
emotions ought not be neglected.]{.underline}** Social death should
guide Black resistance strategy in understanding the position of the
Black within civil society, but it speaks not to the arrangement of
Black intra-ontological questions. **[[If this is measured by social
death it only produces a cycle of endless internal psychic
violence]{.mark} because the Black would only be met with the discovery
of a violent reality of its existence through affirmations of social
death.]{.underline}** Intra-ontological resistance must not be a
question of how the world understands Blackness, because the position of
the slave is one that cannot be articulated in terms of hegemony**[. If
it is so that the Black inherently experiences the world through a
different ontological register, then measures of B[lack liberation
cannot be articulated through the lens of humanist
grammars]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Jared Sexton, the Director of the
African-American Studies School of Humanities at the University of
California-Irvine, is another leading scholar in Afro-pessimism. He
explains that **[[there is]{.mark} indeed [social life]{.mark} that
exists [within social death]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There are many that
condemn the invocation of social death as overly pessimistic, but "this
acceptance or affirmation is active; it is a willing or willingness, in
other words, to pay whatever social costs accrue to being black, to
inhabiting blackness, to living a black social life under the shadow of
social death. This is not an accommodation to the dictates of the
antiblack world" (Sexton 2010). This is to say that **[it is indeed
possible to both affirm the state of social death and actively pursue
the social life that exists within Blackness.]{.underline}** This is not
the typical critique of social death, but rather it is a necessary
specification of the social life within social death that Sexton speaks.
**[Social death is adequate in terms of measuring the ontological state
of the human versus the Black, but a different rubric is required in
mapping social life within social death.]{.underline}** One such rubric
is fleshly politics. This concept derives from the plantation in regards
to the manner in which **[[slaves would temporarily]{.mark} reclaim and
[weaponize their bodies as a site of political
protest]{.mark}]{.underline}** against their state of enslavement.
Fleshy politics is an example of an appropriate rubric for measuring
liberation within intra-ontological politics because **[these bodily
resistances surely did not change the physical state of enslavement, but
it did immeasurable good for the mental and psychological state of those
in the master's cage.]{.underline}** Alternate orientations to the flesh
"excavates the social (after)life of these categories: it represents
racializing assemblages of subjection that can never annihilate the
lines of flight, freedom dreams, practices of liberation, and
possibilities of other worlds" (Weheliye 2014). In contrast to
Wilderson's line of flight away from bodily coding, **[it is important
to reclaim the atrocity of the flesh as a means of agency within capture
through the remapping of whiteness.]{.underline}** The enslaved female
flesh was the site of great violence, but there is a false "dichotomy
between the material/political and the personal, in large measure
\[because even though the\] body, so deeply personal, is also a
political arena. Their work has demonstrated the extent to which
women\'s bodies were unique sites of domination under slavery" (Camp
2002**). [[Though the body was in the possession of the slave master,
the enslaved found personal meaning in its temporary recapture in
fleshliness]{.mark} which satisfied an innate desire for
selfhood.]{.underline} [The illegality of using the flesh as a site of
pleasure became a political counter-investment. While [conventional
Afro-Pessimists would argue]{.mark} that [this]{.mark} personal
orientation [does nothing]{.mark}]{.underline}** in terms of the
ontological position within Blackness**[, the personal victory the
enslaved experiences as a result of that temporary reclamation is
meaningful in both psychological and emotional terms]{.underline}**.
This is important **[because [if there is never room for personal
liberation]{.mark},]{.underline}** and Black resistance is only
understood in terms of material questions within civil society, **[[it
reproduces the same sacrificial logic that social death
explains.]{.mark} Resistance [strategies that only take meaning in
notions of full agency are recipes for failure because these only
measure Black liberation on the register]{.mark} of civil society [which
can never grapple with]{.mark} the inherent confine in which [Black
life]{.mark} exists.]{.underline}**

#### Wildersonian calls for the end of the world reify the position of ontological blackness by theorizing through a matrix that can only breed ressentiment and tactical flinches are good for subverting humanism.

The question remains of how to create consistency in ontological and
intra-ontological resistance**[. Is it materially possible to both call
for a disruption of civil society while finding points of productivity
in society? The answer is yes, at the margins.]{.underline}** It is here
that this paper makes another substantive departure from conventional
pessimistic theorization, and again, it is useful to refer to
Wilderson's work. His theorization of the Black's antagonistic
relationship with the world concludes that **[the world is parasitic on
Black life. Thus, he forwards the end of the world as the only ethical
alternative.]{.underline}** Afro-Pessimists are often criticized for
their highly theoretical abstraction with this concept. Though there are
no explicit specifications of what the end of the world is or how Black
resistance movements are to specifically get there, it is widely
accepted that the position is more of an epistemic orientation rather
than one that forwards literal destruction. In addition, **[[Wilderson
calls for]{.mark} Black refusal to engage in civil society in
an [unflinching paradigmatic analysis meaning that any form of
engagement with civil society would require Black abjection.]{.mark}
This is the point of friction that this paper seeks to
address.]{.underline}** Even though Black bodies stand in an
antagonistic relationship to the world, there needs to be a distinction
made. **[[The notion that any]{.mark} level of [stability within civil
society affirms Black Death]{.mark} has two major problems. First, it
[produces the exact same pattern of ressentiment which
reproduces]{.mark} the internalization of [self-hate]{.mark} which only
sets the stage for communal violence in an attempt to cleanse. [If the
standard for measuring]{.mark} the effectiveness of [Black movements is
the destruction of]{.mark} every part of [society, then failure is
the]{.mark} only appropriate [descriptor for every]{.mark} Black
resistance [strategy]{.mark} in history. If this is the case, t[he
internalization of Black slaveness becomes]{.mark} all but
[inevitable]{.mark} by reinforcing psychological, mental, and emotional
chains of depression on all those who seek to resistance. The second
problem is that [Black bodies have no means of creating instability at
the]{.mark} state or [societal level. Society is a manifestation of
hundreds of years of]{.mark} economic and political
[accumulation]{.mark} that has yielded countless weapons against the
oppressed. Simply expecting the dominant order to forgo the use of those
weapons is a fantasy.]{.underline}** The scope of orienting towards the
end of the world in terms of instability is far too large. **[[The end
of the world is not possible]{.mark}. Afro-Pessimism is far too
separated from the material practice of resistance in this
regard]{.underline}**. If the justification for detaching from state
involvement is that it requires a sacrificing of Black flesh, then
resistance strategies must consider the effect of a complete embrace of
political refusal. Calls for absolute Black pessimism is also an
abjection of Black flesh in the same manner Wilderson bases the need for
the end of the world because an open refusal and rejection to at least
seemingly conform to degrees of social norms will have deadly
consequences for Black bodies. **[[For pessimists to call for Blacks to
openly embrace physical death]{.mark} in pursuit of theory [is]{.mark}
irresponsible and [unethical.]{.mark} Wilderson uses the question
of flinching as a misnomer. The term seems to suggest that any
participation in or any implicit affirmation of society is an
insufficient Black politic.]{.underline}** The problem is that at its
core the very nature of **[Black life is one that requires a series of
strategic and tactical flinches. This means that in different situations
and settings, Black bodies take different forms.]{.underline}** If
confronted on the street by a racist police officer, asking for one to
unconditionally refuse to recognize the position of the officer is in
turn asking for Black suicidal politics. As posited above, there is
something inherently valuable within Black intra-ontological
arrangements, and as such, suicide is a non-starter. Not only is this a
strategy for sustaining intra-ontological freedom, but it is also a
strategy for pursuing the disorganization of civil society. It
problematizes society's ability to easily script the nature of Black
life and Black resistance. [**[Tactical flinches allow Blackness to
become a thousand different villains disguised as
citizens]{.underline}**.]{.mark} It is a protective mechanism for those
who seek to fight against tyranny without inciting the wrath of the
tyrannical. **[[This is not to say]{.mark} that [Black resistance
should]{.mark} ever [flinch in its orientation to civil society]{.mark}
at a fundamental level. It is to say that in order for Black life to
exist in a world that wishes its death, it is necessary to disguise that
orientation]{.underline}** and strategically present it in certain
settings. Some will be highly critical of this notion because it will be
perceived as a call to sacrifice expressions of authentic self in an
appeasement of the dominant order. Instead, this is a call to reassess
the very understanding of political orientation. **[Black resistance
should embody refusal]{.underline}** at the core level; that should be
internalized, and it is the very process of mystifying that core refusal
in acts of fugitive transgressions against civil society that renders
its violence inoperable. **[This is not a sacrifice of the authentic
self, but the mystification and protection of authentic Blackness in an
act of rebellion against societal production of anti-Black violence.
This is an effective means of navigating Black ontological
questions.]{.underline}** Again, Black liberation cannot be measured in
terms of the absence of white violence, but it must be measured using
different rubrics. In terms of Black ontological resistance as an
ensemble, this resistance is a question is the maintenance of Black
communities through the inoperability of violence by complicating
perceptions of Black criminality. Since the slave has no capacity to
orchestrate the manifestation of the end of the world, then Black
orientation to the end of the world must begin with one of constructing
the illegality of the body. This is the means in which Black movements
must employ fleshly politics in modern resistance strategies**[. [The
end of the world should not be understood through]{.mark} the
i[nstability]{.mark} of civil society or the state, [but]{.mark} rather,
it should be understood through [the ability of Black communities to
render themselves self-sufficient]{.mark} which should very well include
a strategic and criminal relationship with civil society.]{.underline}**

### 2AC -- Alt Fails

#### The alt abrogates their ethical responsibility to engage in praxis based thought and answer the question "what is to be done?" and they are wrong about their ontological framing claims

**Gordon 15** (the leading scholar of Fanon in the US, PhD from Yale,
Professor of Philosophy and African American Studies at UConn) (Lewis,
Lewis Gordon presents "What Fanon Said", Speech at Red Emma's hosted by
former Towson debater Ben Morgan, 6/10/2015, Transcribed by Quigley,

And what he said Sartre failed to understand is that genuine dialectical
thinking is not closed but open. That [[for Black revolutionary thought
to be revolutionary it has to have contingency,
possibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**.** And one of the things to bear in
mind about this is that a lot of us don't understand the difference
between contingency and accident. You see [[in the human world there is
contingency, that's why there's freedom]{.underline}]{.mark}. But
nothing, nothing that goes down is accidental. The world that we're
living in today, [[everything]{.mark} that is going on]{.underline}, is
not accidental because they [[are functions of human
agency]{.underline}]{.mark}. So in effect what Fanon was arguing is that
if you're going to deal with the question of [[social
transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}, if you're going to deal with
questions such as revolution, it [[requires putting the human being back
into human relations]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [what many people are
looking for are [models in which]{.mark} some how words]{.underline},
thought, ideas [[function like wizardry]{.underline}]{.mark}. That [[if
you]{.mark} can [get the right words]{.mark},]{.underline} [[like an
incantation, you change the world]{.mark} but]{.underline} what [[Fanon
is arguing]{.underline}]{.mark} is that [[no**,**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the [words are to clarify what you are to do]{.mark}]{.underline}. So
in effect we could argue that Fanon is making an important existential
political thesis which is that [[praxis will
produce]{.mark}]{.underline} the thought, the ideas, [[the world]{.mark}
to come]{.underline} [[but you must take responsibility for
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. And in fact a lot of Fanon's thought is about
that question of responsibility and how radical is it. Well you see
[[we're]{.underline}]{.mark} not just [[responsible for trying to build
the ethical face]{.mark}, the political actions at hand]{.underline},
more radically, and you know that point I said about justifications,
we're even responsible for responsibility. So it means that [[if you're
going to be committed to issues of social chance]{.underline}]{.mark},
for Fanon, [[you have to ask]{.underline}]{.mark}, in a nutshell,
[[what're you gonna do?]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Results matters -- failure to have a course of action for mobilizing populations dooms the alt. EVEN if they win their ethics claims, you have to evaluate the question of alt solvency first.

**Day 9** (Christopher, The Historical Failure of Anarchism:
Implications for the Future of the Revolutionary Project,
http://mikeely.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/historical_failure_of_aanarchism_chris_day_kasama.pdf)

The strength of anarchism is its moral insistence on the primacy of
human freedom over political expediency. But human freedom exists in a
political context. [[It is not sufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[to]{.mark} simply [take the most uncompromising position in defense of
freedom**.** It is neccesary to actually win
freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}. Anti-capitalism doesn't do the victims of
capitalism any good if you don't actually destroy capitalism.
[[Anti-statism doesn't do the victims of the state any good if you don't
actually smash the state]{.mark}.]{.underline} Anarchism has been very
good at putting forth visions of a free society and that is for the
good. But [[it is worthless if we don't develop an actual strategy for
realizing those visions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It is not enough to be
right, we must also win.]{.underline}

**Continues...**

Finally [[revolutionaries have a responsibility to have a plausible plan
for making revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}. Obviously [[there are not
enough revolutionaries to make a revolution at this
moment]{.underline}]{.mark}. We can reasonably anticipate that the
future will bring upsurges in popular opposition to the existing system.
Without being any more specific about where those upsurges might occur
it seems clear that it is from the ranks of such upsurges that the
numbers of the revolutionary movement will be increased, eventually
leading to a revolutionary situation (which is distinguished from the
normal crises of the current order only by the existence of a
revolutionary movement ready to push things further). People who are fed
up with the existing system and who are willing to commit themselves to
its overthrow will look around for likeminded people who have an idea of
what to do. [If we don't have a plausible plan for making revolution we
can be sure that there will be somebody else there who will. [There is
no guarantee that revolutionary-minded people will be spontaneously
drawn to anti-authoritarian politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. The plan
doesn't have to be an exact blueprint. It shouldn't be treated as
something sacred. It should be subject to constant revision in light of
experience and debate. But at the very least it needs to be able to
answer questions that have been posed concretely in the past. We know
that we will never confront the exact same circumstances as previous
revolutions. But we should also know that certain problems are
persistent ones and that if we can't say what we would have done in the
past we should not expect people to think much of our ability to face
the future.
