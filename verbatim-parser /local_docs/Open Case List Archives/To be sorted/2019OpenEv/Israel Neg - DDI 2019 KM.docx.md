[Israeli contributions to US national interests]{.underline}

In addition to and outside of the peace process, history provides
numerous examples [of specific Israeli actions that have benefited US
national interests]{.underline}.

During the Cold War, the most celebrated were Israel's daring theft of
Soviet radar from Egypt in 1969, Israel's positive reply to President
Nixon's request to fly reconnaissance missions and mobilize troops to
help turn around Syria's invasion of Jordan in 1970, and Israel's
sharing of technical intelligence on numerous Soviet weapons systems
captured during the 1967 and 1973 wars. More recently[, Israeli
counterproliferation efforts -- including bombing the Iraqi nuclear
reactor]{.underline} in 1981 --have contributed substantially to US
interests. And the 2007 attack on the North Korea -- supplied Syrian
reactor, never formally acknowledged by Israel, [ensured that Bashar
al-Assad's progress toward a nuclear weapon--and a very dangerous
proliferation move by North Korea--was stopped at an early
stage.]{.underline}

On a number of occasions, Israel has also made difficult decisions not
to act--policy choices sometimes made in discordance with its own
strictly national interests and perspectives--and that restraint has
been important to US national interests. Such was the case with Israel's
decision to accede to a US request not to retaliate against Iraqi Scud
attacks during the first Gulf War, which American officials feared would
lead to Arab states withdrawing from the international coalition.
Similarly, after a sometimes ugly dispute with Washington, [Israel
agreed to terminate the sale of problematic weapons and military
technology to China and deprive itself of both a major market for its
world-class military exports and a source of influence with
Beijing.]{.underline}

Today, Israeli contributions to US national interests range across a
broad spectrum.

For example:

• [Through joint training and exercises as well as exchanges on military
doctrine]{.underline}, [the United States has benefited in the areas of
**counter-terrorism cooperation**,]{.underline} [tactical intelligence,
and experience in urban warfare]{.underline}. The largest-ever US-Israel
joint exercise is scheduled for spring 2012.

[• Israeli technology promotes American interests]{.underline}.
Increasingly, US homeland security and military agencies are turning to
Israeli technology to solve some of their most vexing technical
problems. This support ranges from advice and expertise on behavioral
screening techniques for airport security to acquiring an
Israeli-produced tactical radar system to enhance force protection.
[Israel has been a world leader in the development of **unmanned aerial
systems**, for both intelligence collection and combat, and it has
shared with the US military the technology]{.underline}, the doctrine,
and its experience regarding these systems. Israel is also a global
pacesetter in active measures for armored vehicle protection, [defense
against **short-range rocket threats**]{.underline}, and the techniques
and procedures of robotics, all of which it has shared with the United
States.

• In the vital realm of **[missile defense cooperation]{.underline}**,
the United States has a broad and multifaceted relationship with Israel,
[its most sophisticated and experienced partner]{.underline} in this
preeminent domain for the United States. Israel's national missile
defenses--including the US deployment in Israel of an advanced X-band
radar system and the more than 100 American military personnel who man
it--[will be an integral part of a larger missile defense architecture
spanning Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Persian Gulf that
will **help protect US forces and allies** throughout this vast
area]{.underline}. For this reason, the director of the Pentagon's
Missile Defense Agency recently praised the specific contribution that
Israel's integrated, multi-layered command- and-control network [makes
to the US military's ability to defend against **the Iranian missile
threat**.]{.underline}

• While it is certainly true that Israel gains significantly from
generous US financial assistance to its military--most of it spent in
[America--Israel's defense industries have certain unique competencies
that benefit the United States]{.underline}. One result is [the growing
importance to the US military of Israeli defense goods, as the United
States has taken advantage of access to unique Israeli capabilities in
key "niche" areas of military technology.]{.underline}

OVERALL, THE value of annual US purchases of Israeli defense articles
has increased steadily over the past decade, from less than a half
billion dollars in the early 2000s to about \$1.5 billion today. Among
the Israeli-developed defense equipment used by the US military are
short-range unmanned aircraft systems that have seen service in Iraq and
Afghanistan; targeting pods on hundreds of Air Force, Navy, and Marine
strike aircraft; a revolutionary helmet-mounted sight that is standard
in nearly all frontline Air Force and Navy fighter aircraft; lifesaving
armor installed in thousands of MRAP armored vehicles used in Iraq and
Afghanistan; and a gun system for close-in defense of naval vessels
against terrorist dinghies and small-boat swarms. Moreover[, American
and Israeli companies are working together to jointly produce Israel's
**Iron Dome**--the world's first combat proven counter-rocket
system.]{.underline}

• **[Counter-terrorism and intelligence cooperation]{.underline}** is
deep and extensive, with [the United States and Israel working to
advance their common interest in defeating the terrorism of Hamas,
Hezbollah, and al-Qaida]{.underline} and its affiliate groups [by
sharing information, supporting preventive actions, deterring
challenges, and coordinating overall strategy.]{.underline} Joint
Special Forces training and exercises, collaboration on shared targets,
and [close cooperation among the relevant US and Israeli security
agencies testify to the value of this relationship.]{.underline}

• More broadly, [Israel is a full partner in intelligence operations
that benefit both countries, such as efforts to interdict the supply of
parts **to Iran's nuclear program** or to **prevent weapons
smuggling**]{.underline} in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. This
intimate relationship reinforces overall US intelligence efforts by
providing Washington [with access to Israel's unique set of capabilities
for collection and assessments on key countries and issues in the
region]{.underline}, since [Israel is able to focus resources and
attention on certain targets of central importance to the United
States]{.underline}. Such was the case, for example, when Israel passed
to the United States conclusive photographic evidence that Syria, with
**[North Korean assistance]{.underline}**, had made enormous strides
toward "going hot" with a plutonium-producing reactor. As Israel's
strategic intelligence collection capabilities (e.g., satellite and
unmanned aerial systems) mature and improve, this cooperation and
[exchange of intelligence information and analysis will increasingly
serve US national interests.]{.underline}

• Given that [Iran and its allies in the greater Middle East represent
clear and present dangers to US interests]{.underline},
[Israel]{.underline}'s military-- the most powerful in the region--plays
an important role in addressing those threats posed especially by Syria,
Hezbollah, and to some extent, Iran itself. [The ability of the Israeli
armed forces to deter the military ambitions of destabilizing regional
actors promotes American national interests because it presents our
common enemies with an additional -- and potent -- military capability
to resist their aggression.]{.underline}

• Looking to the future, Israel's world class expertise in two
cutting-edge areas of national security -- **[cyber
defense]{.underline}** and national resilience planning and
implementation -- will increasingly redound to the benefit of the United
States. Israel is a primary place where [the United States can build an
enduring partnership to try to secure the cyber commons]{.underline}, as
enunciated in the administration's International Strategy for
Cyberspace. With its world-class information technology, **[R&D, and
cyber security capabilities]{.underline}**, [Israel will be an ever more
important player in efforts to secure cyberspace and to **protect
critical US national infrastructure from cyber attack.**]{.underline}

Through the Israel-based activities of major US companies or the
licensing in the United States of Israeli technologies, Israel's
[excellence in cyber security already benefits critical US
infrastructure such as banking, communications, utilities,
transportation, and general Internet connectivity]{.underline}. And if
security concerns of both parties can be managed, **[Israel can become a
major partner in efforts to exploit the military applications of cyber
power]{.underline}**, in the same way that the two countries have
established collaborative relationships in intelligence and
counter-terrorism.

Finally, drawing on its experience in [**building a flourishing economy
and vibrant democracy** despite decades of conflict and
terrorism]{.underline}, Israel has a role to play in helping the United
States deepen its own internal resilience in [dealing with terrorist
threats against the homeland **and the impact of natural
disasters**]{.underline}.

In a political context, it is important to note that
[Israel]{.underline} -- unlike other Middle Eastern countries whose
governments are partners with the United States -- [is already a stable
democracy, which will not be swept aside by sudden uprising or explosive
revolution]{.underline}, a fact that may become more important in the
turbulent period ahead.

Moreover, for all our periodic squabbles, Israel's people and
politicians have a deeply entrenched pro-American outlook that is
uniformly popular with the Israeli people. Thus, Israel's support of US
national interests is woven tightly into the fabric of Israeli
democratic political culture, a crucial characteristic that is currently
not found in any other nation in the greater Middle East.

We do not argue that Israel's assistance to the United States is more
valuable to the United States than American support of Israel is to
Israel. [Nor do we deny that there are costs to the]{.underline} United
States, in the [Arab world and elsewhere]{.underline}, for its support
of Israel, as [there are costs to US support of other beleaguered --and
sometime imperfect]{.underline} -- friends, from West Berlin in the Cold
War to Kuwait in 1990-91 to Taiwan today.

We are, [however, convinced that in a net assessment those real **costs
are markedly outweighed by the**]{.underline} many [**ways in which
Israel bolsters US national interests**]{.underline} and the benefits
that Israel provides to those interests.

### 1nc -- worse for palestine

#### the aff would be perceived as an imbalance -- only a risk Israeli aggression increases

Further, [given the Palestinian sensitivity and aversion to being
consigned to perpetual power inferiority vis-à-vis a Jewish
state]{.underline} (recall the importance of power parity in settling
Arab disputes), it would appear necessary that [any agreement requiring
disarmament or arms control]{.underline} (an Israeli demand regarding a
future Palestinian state) **[be posed as a mutual and not a unilateral
process]{.underline}**, [with third-party security guarantees as well as
developmental assistance programmes]{.underline} built in. Budd, for
example, has pointed out that such guarantees would be imperative and
that unfortunately while the Oslo peace process of the 1990s focused
productively [on the objective concerns of both sides, it did little to
change the cognitive structure, the historical myths and mindsets, i.e.,
the cultural constructs on both sides.]{.underline}33 [If]{.underline},
for example, a [Palestinian state emerged in two parts -- Gaza and the
West Bank -- with only a road connecting them through Israeli territory,
**it could become another symbol of Arab inferiority**, vulnerability
and humiliation]{.underline}. Third-party (American) security guarantees
played a critical part, along with significant ongoing financial
assistance to both sides, in the Israeli--Egyptian 536 F. S. PEARSON
Camp David accords. It also appears that considerable mutual respect had
been built between the Israeli and Egyptian armed forces after the 1973
war, leading to a more durable, if not exactly cordial agreement that
has withstood the test of time and innumerable nearby crises, as for
example in Gaza. As described in secret dispatches to Washington in 1973
by then US Ambassador to Israel, Kenneth Keating, 1. While we have not
had opportunity in past few days to learn private views of Israeli
leadership on such matters, those Israelis with whom we have spoken,
including [Israeli military officers, seem to be experiencing some
changes in attitude toward Arabs]{.underline} which is parallel to
growing Egyptian self-confidence vis-à-vis Israel \... For example,
these Israelis are [saying they must rethink their previous assumption
about Arab]{.underline} character, courage, [ability to learn modern
technology, and capacity for planning, coordination, and keeping of
secrets]{.underline}. They are impressed by Egyptian--Syrian strategy
and war effort so far. 2. **[This does not necessarily bode well for
future Middle East peace efforts]{.underline}**. Out of its newly gained
respect for Arab military prosess \[sic\], [Israel may be still more
concerned about seeking enlarged borders than before.]{.underline} But
changed Israeli attitude could, at least in one small respect, help:
Israeli references to Arabs \... in future \... omit note of
condescension occasionally present in past.34 Friday 13 October 1973.

### 1nc -- fill-in

#### US arms sales are perceived as a larger extension of US attempts to undermine Chinese influence

**Efron et. al 19** (Shira Efron, Howard J. Shatz, Arthur Chan, Emily
Haskel, Lyle J. Morris, Andrew Scobell, "The Evolving Israel-China
Relationship", RAND corporation, published 2019,
<https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR2600/RR2641/RAND_RR2641.pdf> -
BIB)

Finally, some [policymakers in China might view China's relationship
with Israel as an opportunity to make inroads with a key U.S. ally in
the Middle East as part of a broader strategy by China to undermine U.S.
diplomacy and global alliance]{.underline} and partner [networks. China
clearly understands the close alliance that exists between Israel and
the United States, to include closely monitoring]{.underline} **[U.S.
arms sales to Israel and their implications for China]{.underline}**.39
[China]{.underline} also [perceives U.S.]{.underline}
[alliances]{.underline} in Asia, but also in other parts of the world,
[as inherently antithetical to Chinese interests and]{.underline} in
some cases seeks to actively [undermine their value and
utility]{.underline}.40 Chinese scholars have devoted attention to the
history and value of the U.S.-Israeli alliance over time, for example.41
Therefore, in all likelihood, [**China views its relationship with
Israel as an extension of** a larger **effort to undermine** key
alliance relationships with **the United States**]{.underline} and might
look for opportunities to forge closer ties with Israel at Washington's
expense.

There are limitations to Chinese influence in this regard. Given China's
desire to be perceived as a nonaligned and noninterventionist partner in
the region, and considering China's strong trade and military ties with
certain countries in the Middle East---some of which have contentious
relations with both the West and Israel---China could encounter
roadblocks that will limit closer relations with Israel. [Although China
seeks to deepen its ties with Israel, it is also aware of]{.underline}
its limitations vis-à-vis supplanting [the role of the United States
within Israeli foreign policy.]{.underline}42 Despite this recognition
of its limitations, [the Chinese reportedly have hinted to Israelis
**that the geostrategic situation might well be different over the
longer term**]{.underline}---in 50 years, for example---**[and might
turn more in China's favor]{.underline}**.43 It is too early to say
whether this statement reflects Chinese intentions in the region in the
long run or pushes Israel to change its policies.

#### china perceives israel as the core asset of US middle eastern influence

**Gilsinan 19** (KATHY GILSINAN national secuirity and global affairs
writer for *The Atlantic*, "The U.S. Is Worried About China's
Investments---This Time in Israel", JUL 11, 2019,

BIB)

U.S. national-security officials have for years warned developing
nations about the [dangers of allowing Chinese investment in their
countries]{.underline}. But now the [Defense Department is worried about
**China's investments in** one of America's closest allies,
**Israel**]{.underline}. China's ultimate aim, defense officials fear,
is the same as the one it has pursued in Africa, East Asia, and
elsewhere: **[to chip away at America's influence.]{.underline}**

For the U.S., [a Chinese incursion in Israel, which cooperates with
Washington on]{.underline} some of the most sensitive national-security
issues---including [Iran's regional activities and the ongoing fight
against the Islamic State]{.underline}---[is especially
concerning.]{.underline}

China's economic campaign is under way as it builds up its military
across the board. [Beijing is]{.underline}, for the first time in the
modern era, [beginning to project its military power outside its own
region]{.underline}---most notably [building its first-ever overseas
base]{.underline} in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa and adjacent to one
of the world's most important oil-transit choke points, through the Bab
al-Mandeb Strait. [That base also happens to sit cheek by jowl with a
U.S. base of about 4,000 people; it is a key hub in the U.S. drone
wars]{.underline} in Somalia and Yemen.

"While we are not asking Israel to avoid dealing with China entirely, we
have open discussions with all our closest allies and partners on the
national security implications of Chinese investment," said Michael
Mulroy, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East,
in a written statement to The Atlantic.

Mulroy noted that within three years, [a Chinese state-owned company is
expected to operate part of the Haifa port, near an Israeli naval base
that serves as a frequent port of call for the U.S.]{.underline} Navy's
Sixth Fleet. China's investment in the port [prompted a rare objection
from the U.S. Navy to Israeli counterparts]{.underline} when it was
first disclosed last year. As Amos Harel, a correspondent for the
Israeli newspaper Haaretz, noted in the paper, "[China is acquiring vast
influence over essential infrastructures in Israel and, indirectly, also
a closer look at some of Israel's military capabilities."]{.underline}

School of Government, Harvard University, "THE ISRAEL LOBBY AND U.S.
FOREIGN POLICY", MIDDLE EAST POLICY, VOL. XIII, NO. 3, FALL 2006,
<http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/IsraelLobby.pdf> -BIB)

What Is the Lobby? We use \"the lobby\" as a convenient short-hand term
for [the loose coalition of individuals and organizations that actively
work to shape U.S. foreign policy in a proIsrael direction.]{.underline}
Our use of this term is not meant to suggest that \"the lobby\" is a
unified movement with a central leadership or that individuals within it
do not disagree on certain issues. The lobby is not a cabal or
conspiracy, and its activities are essentially consistent with the
interest-group tradition that has long governed American political life.
[The core of the lobby consists of American Jews who make a significant
effort in their daily lives to bend U.S. foreign policy so that it
advances Israel\'s interests.]{.underline}65 Their [activities go beyond
merely voting for candidates]{.underline} who are proIsrael to include
writing letters, contributing money and supporting pro-Israel
organizations. But [the lobby is not synonymous with American
Jews]{.underline}. Israel is not a salient issue for many of them, and
many do not support the lobby\'s positions. In a 2004 survey, for
example, roughly 36 percent of Jewish-Americans said they were either
\"not very\" or \"not at all\" emotionally attached to Israel.66
Moreover, some groups that work on Israel\'s behalf --- such as the
\"Christian Zionists\" discussed below --- are not Jewish.
Jewish-Americans also differ on specific Israeli policies. [Many of the
key organizations in the lobby, like AIPAC and the Conference of
Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, are run by hardliners who
**generally supported the expansionist policies of
Israel**]{.underline}\'s Likud party, [including its
hostility]{.underline} to the Oslo peace process. The bulk of U.S.
Jewry, on the other hand, is more favorably disposed to making
concessions to the Palestinians, and a few groups --- such as Jewish
Voice for Peace --- strongly advocate such steps.67 Despite these
differences, the majority of organized groups in the American Jewish
community favor steadfast U.S. support for Israel. Not surprisingly,
[American Jewish leaders often consult with Israeli officials so that
the former can maximize their influence in the United
States]{.underline}. As one activist with a major Jewish organization
wrote, \"[It is routine for us to say: \'This is our policy on a certain
issue, but we must check what the Israelis think]{.underline}.\' We as a
community do it all the time.\" 68 [There is also a strong norm against
criticizing Israeli policy]{.underline}, and **[Jewish-American leaders
rarely support putting pressure on Israel]{.underline}**. Thus, Edgar
Bronfman, Sr., the president of the World Jewish Congress, was accused
of \"perfidy\" when he wrote a letter to President Bush in mid-2003
urging him to pressure Israel to curb construction of its controversial
\"security fence.\" 69 Critics declared, \"[**It would be obscene** at
any time **for the president** of the World Jewish Congress to lobby the
president of the United States **to resist policies being promoted by
the government of Israel.\"**]{.underline} Similarly, when Israel Policy
Forum president Seymour Reich advised Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice to [pressure Israel to reopen a critical border crossing in the
Gaza Strip]{.underline} in November 2005, critics [denounced his action
as \"irresponsible behavior]{.underline}\" and [declared, \"There is
absolutely no room in the Jewish mainstream for actively canvassing
against the security-related policies . . . of Israel]{.underline}.\" 70
Recoiling from these attacks, Reich proclaimed, \"**[The word pressure
is not in my vocabulary when it comes to Israel]{.underline}**.\"
Jewish-Americans [have formed an impressive array of organizations to
influence American foreign policy]{.underline}, of which AIPAC is the
most powerful and well known. In 1997, Fortune magazine asked members of
Congress and their staffs to [list the most powerful lobbies in
Washington]{.underline}.71 [AIPAC was ranked second behind]{.underline}
the American Association of Retired People ([AARP]{.underline}) but
[ahead of heavyweight lobbies like the AFL-CIO and the National Rifle
Association (NRA)]{.underline}. A National Journal study in March 2005
reached a similar conclusion, placing AIPAC in second place (tied with
AARP) in Washington\'s \"muscle rankings.\" 72 [The lobby also includes
prominent Christian evangelicals]{.underline} like Gary Bauer, Jerry
Falwell, Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson, as well as Dick Armey and Tom
DeLay, former [majority leaders in the House]{.underline} of
Representatives. These \"Christian Zionists\" [believe Israel\'s rebirth
is part of Biblical prophecy, **support its expansionist** agenda and
think pressuring Israel is contrary to God\'s will.]{.underline}73 In
addition, the lobby also draws support from neoconservative gentiles
such as John Bolton, the late Wall Street Journal editor Robert Bartley,
former Secretary of Education William Bennett, former UN Ambassador
Jeanne Kirkpatrick and columnist George Will. Sources of Power The
United States has a divided government that offers [many avenues for
influencing the policy process]{.underline}. As a result, [interest
groups can shape policy in many different ways: lobbying elected
representatives and members of the Executive Branch, making campaign
contributions, voting in elections, molding public opinion]{.underline},
etc.74 Furthermore, special-interest groups enjoy disproportionate power
when they are committed to a particular issue and the bulk of the
population is indifferent. This is often the case in foreign affairs.
[Policy makers will tend to accommodate those who care about the issue
in question, even if their numbers are small]{.underline}, confident
that the rest of the population will not penalize them. [The Israel
lobby\'s power flows from its unmatched ability to play this game of
interest-group politics]{.underline}. In its basic operations, it is [no
different from the farm lobby, the NRA, steel and textile-workers
groups, and other ethnic lobbies]{.underline}. **[What sets the Israel
lobby apart is its extraordinary effectiveness]{.underline}**. But there
is nothing improper about American Jews and their Christian allies
attempting to sway U.S. policy towards Israel. To repeat: the lobby\'s
activities are not the sort of conspiracy depicted in antisemitic tracts
like the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. For the most part, the
individuals and [groups that comprise the lobby are doing what other
special-interest groups do, just much better]{.underline}. Moreover,
[pro-Arab interest groups are weak to non-existent, which makes the
lobby\'s task even easier]{.underline}.75

In fact, Burton (1998) went so far as to suggest that such [critical
identity-related issues are not subject to bargaining or compromise
along the lines that more material matters]{.underline} are, as **[there
is an implicit "need" to have one's identity recognized and
legitimated]{.underline}**. While many scholars are critical of this
approach as being too deterministic and opaque (Rubenstein, 2001;
Marker, 2003), there is certainly some merit in recognizing that unmet
needs can---albeit contextually---count as an independent variable
worthy of consideration when analyzing conflicts (Rubenstein, 2001).
Thus[, feelings of existential threat can lead to intractability or
emerge as the result of intractability]{.underline}. Either way, such
**[intractability produces dichotomous "us versus-them]{.underline}**"
[thinking that is characteristic of identity-based
conflicts]{.underline} (Kriesberg, 2003a). For our purposes, [social
identity is understood to be socially constructed insofar as there has
historically been mobility between various elements of identity,
including religious, ethnic, racial, and other considerations depending
on the context]{.underline}---although some elements of ethnicity are
more malleable than others (Kriesberg, 2003a). Identity-based conflicts,
[especially ethnic oriented conflicts such as the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict result in competitive thinking, in which social groups broadly
share similar values, beliefs, and aspirations that seemingly---or
realistically---contradict those shared by a competing social
group]{.underline}. While intractability is not necessarily a permanent
condition, it is unlikely to be alleviated unless some form of mutually
beneficial congruence is established between the competing social groups
in question. It should be noted that possessing a set of identities is
natural and necessary, and is not a problem in and of itself; rather
**[the denial of a particularly salient element of a collective group's
identity is likely to result in social conflict]{.underline}** [that
will almost certainly be intractable until recognition of that element
of identity is respected]{.underline}. That is, **[there needs to be a
legitimation of one's identity vis-à-vis an adversarial social
group]{.underline}** that can lead to a positive-sum set of social
relations that hitherto [is impossible to achieve]{.underline} (Marker,
2003). As Marker [poignantly illustrated regarding the

### 1nc -- FMF -- alt cause

#### **alt cause -- US signed a 10-year deal granting foreign military financing that fuels israel's domestic defense industry** 

**Plitnick 19** (Mitchell Plitnick Speaking to an audience at the annual
summit of the far-right Christians United for Israel, "U.S. Aid To
Israel: What You Need To Know", Lobe Log, APRIL 22, 2019,
<https://lobelog.com/u-s-aid-to-israel-what-you-need-to-know/> - BIB)

These new realities can and should lead to a serious discussion about
U.S. aid to Israel. But this is not a simple question. [Advocates of
cutting that aid, or of using it as leverage to pressure Israel, must
understand how this aid works]{.underline}, how big a challenge it
represents for advocacy, and how to make a potentially successful
argument against it.

The Obama MOU

On September 14, 2016, U.S. and Israeli representatives signed a new
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that outlined the terms of U.S. aid to
Israel for fiscal years 2019-2028. The government of Benjamin Netanyahu
toyed with the idea of waiting for the next administration. Whether led
by Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, it was likely to feature a president
with a more positive disposition toward the Israeli right wing and to
Netanyahu personally than Obama had. In the end, however, Netanyahu
decided that, with Obama offering a significant increase in annual aid,
it was better to take the deal on the table.

[Obama]{.underline}'s MOU [increased Foreign Military Financing (FMF)
from \$3 billion per year to \$3.3 billion]{.underline}. It also
guaranteed an additional \$500 million per year for missile defense
funding. The previous MOU, negotiated by George W. Bush, required the
president to request separate funding for missile defense every year.

Total aid rose from \$3 billion to \$3.8 billion annually, but it came
with some new conditions. Over the course of the **[10-year agreement, a
special exception allowing Israel to use up to 26.3 percent of FMF aid
money]{.underline}** for "off shore procurement" (OSP) will phase out.
OSP refers to materials bought from sources outside the United States.
Israel's exception meant that it could spend 26.3 percent of the money
it got with Israeli companies, [granting the Israeli weapons and
technology industry a significant boost.]{.underline}

The old MOU, for instance, permitted Israel to use up to \$400 million
of the annual [FMF grant to buy jet fuel]{.underline}. This privilege
was discontinued in FY '19, meaning that Israel will have to purchase
the fuel with its own funds. This reflects Obama's driving purpose
behind these changes: to maximize the benefits to U.S. corporations by
increasing the [FMF funds that return to the U.S. market]{.underline}.

However, Zakheim argued that the only reason Israel can afford them is
because [US military assistance frees up money from other defense
needs.]{.underline}

"[Remaining costs borne by Israel have in effect been subsidized by the
US taxpayer by virtue of the Offshore Procurement (OSP) program. This
program, virtually unique to Israel, allows it to apply American foreign
military assistance funding to projects of its own,"]{.underline} he
said.

Israel currently receives \$3 billion annually from the US and that will
increase to \$3.8 billion per year starting in 2018 and through 2028
under a package agreed in September.

The aid agreement is seen in Israel as key to helping it maintain its
"qualitative military edge" over potential threats, including from an
emboldened Iran now flush with cash after many nuclear-related sanctions
were lifted during the past year in a deal signed with world powers.

[For the US, Israel is cited as a rare island of stability in a region
in turmoil, as well as an ally on non-nuclear security issues in the
region, including cyber warfare and efforts to rein in Islamist terror
groups.]{.underline}

#### The plan could be circumvented by congress through OSP -- they can't fiat an end to FMF, just FMS

**Conahan '91** (Frank C. Conahan, Assistant Comptroller General,
"Isreal: U.S. Military Aid Spent In-Country," *United States General
Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs
Devision*, 5/23/1991, <https://www.gao.gov/assets/220/214192.pdf>)

[The offshore procurement program was established in fiscal year
1984]{.underline} to fund Israel's development of the Lavi fighter
aircraft. [Although US. military aid to foreign recipients is generally
required to be spent in the United States,]{.underline} [Congress can
make exceptions through legislation, and the executive branch can
authorize the expenditure of these funds outside the United States on a
case-by-case basis. Both methods have been used to allow Israel to spend
military aid on offshore procurements.]{.underline}

For fiscal years 1984-91, Congress earmarked almost \$2.8 billion in
Foreign Military Financing (formerly known as Foreign Military Sales)
funds for offshore procurements in Israel. The amount earmarked for
these purchases increased from \$260 million in 1984 to \$476 million in
1991. Since the cancellation of the Lavi program1 in 1987, the program's
purpose has been modified as follows:

"\...That to the extent that the Government of Israel requests that
funds be used for such purposes, grants made available for Israel by
this paragraph shall, as agreed by Israel and the United States, be
available for advanced fighter aircraft programs or for other advanced
weapons systems \[emphasis added\], as follows: (1) up to \$160,000,000
shall be available for research and development in the United States;
and (2) not less than \$476,000,000 shall be available for the
procurement in Israel of defense articles and defense services,
including research and development."2 Under section 42(c) of the Arms
Export Control Act, [the executive branch can also approve the use of
U.S. military aid for offshore procurement]{.underline}s if it
determines that the acquisition is not detrimental to the U.S. economy
or the industrial mobilization base. As a result of section 42(c)
rulings, Israel was granted \$90 million for jet fuel and \$75 million
for unspecified purchases in addition to the amount authorized by
Congress.3

The Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA) administers Foreign
Military Financing funds and oversees all Israeli purchases with these
funds, including those outside the United States. Israel notifies the
United States in advance of the purchases it plans to make in-country,
and Israel's Ministry of Defense oversees in-country contracts and
payments. DSAA requires that Israel provide contractor certification of
the value of foreign (non-US. and non-Israeli) components that are not
eligible for U.S. financing.'Israel pays its contractors in local
currency and is reimbursed by DsAA'for eligible costs in U.S. dollars, a
"hard currency. !'

But [while campaigning during the 2015 Israeli election, which his party

tried to walk back, but one that's [consistent with his long-held belief
that Palestinians can't be trusted to be peaceful
neighbors.]{.underline}

Israel has real reasons to be skeptical of the Palestinian side. [One
major one is the Hamas-Fatah split. Since Hamas took control of Gaza,
Israel has been concerned that any peace agreement with the Palestinian
Authority wouldn't stick in Gaza,]{.underline} [where it has no real
control. That's especially worrying for the Israeli leadership given
Hamas's public commitment to Israel's destruction. Moreover, it's not
clear that Abbas could sell Palestinians on the concessions he'd
inevitably need to make in order to make a deal with
Israel.]{.underline}

[The two sides' basic skepticism of each other's willingness and ability
to make peace is the fundamental reason that the peace push]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} second component in the ideological [case for
supporting Israel is its status as a liberal democracy. This factor is
perhaps the strongest ideological tie that binds Israel to the United
States]{.underline}, since it places Israel firmly in the camp of
Western nations while simultaneously [standing as a glaring contrast to
the surrounding Arab states]{.underline}. The United States has
throughout its history favored alliances with other democracies, and
Israel is no exception in this regard.99 [Spreading democracy and
democratic values throughout the world]{.underline} has been American
policy over the last century, [and Israel fits neatly into this
plan]{.underline}.100 George Shultz remarked that "**[the birth of
Israel also marked the entrance onto the world stage of a new
democracy]{.underline}**. . . . [Israel's success as a thriving
democracy helps sustain our faith in the democratic way of life not only
in America but throughout the world]{.underline}."101 Israel's
democratic character makes it easier for the United States to cooperate
with it while maintaining a clear conscience,102 which is not the case
with other Middle Eastern countries, as the controversy over CIA
renditions of suspected terrorists to allies such as Egypt and Morocco
has made abundantly clear. Finally, since September 11, 2001, the United
States has a new, although unfortunate, [common bond with Israel in that
both countries have suffered civilian casualties at home as a result of
terrorism]{.underline}. [This has served to strengthen American affinity
for Israel, as there is a perception that the United States can now
fully appreciate the inherent sense of unease and danger that exists in
everyday Israeli civilian life]{.underline}. The best example of this is
the concurrent resolution passed by both chambers of Congress in
December 2001 denouncing [Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israeli
civilians and expressing solidarity with Israel in the two countries'
joint fight against terrorism]{.underline}. Other similar expressions
occur on a regular basis in newspaper editorials and politicians'

### 1nc -- Germany -- no solvency

#### Germany and Israel have a special relationship- mean Germany continues to sell arms to Israel no matter what

**Deutsche Welle German** 5-12-20**15**,( \"A Special Case: The
German-Israeli Security Cooperation,\" No Publication,

DIO

Ursula von der Leyen is currently in Israel on the occasion of the 50
year anniversary of the start of diplomatic relations between Germany
and Israel. [The German defense minister]{.underline} will visit the Yad
Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem and host a reception for defense
officials from both countries on the German frigate \"Karlsruhe\" in the
port of Haifa.

On her two-day visit, von der [Leyen will also sit down with her Israeli
counterpart]{.underline} Moshe [Ya\'alon to discuss the countries\'
bilateral security cooperation and ways to strengthen it further.
Germany and Israel have a special relationship]{.underline}, not just
since Angela Merkel announced in a 2008 speech that protecting Israel\'s
security was part of Germany\'s \"raison d\'être.\"

The special case of arms exports to Israel

Looking at the total amount of Euros, Israel was the largest
third-country recipient of German arms exports in the first half of
2014, according to the German government\'s armament export interim
report. Third countries are those that aren\'t EU- or NATO-members.

Israel leading this group is remarkable, because according to
guidelines, [Germany is not supposed to export weapons to a country that
is at war or facing conflicts at its borders - conditions that
definitely apply to Israel, which fought a war with Gaza last summer and
is in constant conflict with the Palestinian territories]{.underline}.

But Israel is a special case for two reasons, explained Sylke Tempel,
editor-in-chief of \"Internationale Politik\" (International Politics)
and the \"Berlin Policy Journal,\" two publications of the German
Council on Foreign Relations. According to the political analyst,
[Germany sells weapons to Israel because of the history linking the two
countries - and for geopolitical reasons.]{.underline}

\"It\'s the state that became a home for Holocaust survivors and the
only state in the world that would welcome Jewish refugees without any
question, should Jews be persecuted again,\" Tempel told DW. \"[And
Israel is the most pluralistic democracy in the region.]{.underline}
Sure, it\'s a democracy with flaws, but it is a democracy.\"

Contentious submarines

The reason that [Israel tops the list of buyers for Germany\'s arms
exports]{.underline} in the first half of 2014 [is a deal for six
submarines]{.underline} that both countries agreed on in 2005. Back then
Germany agreed to sell Israel six Dolphin submarines that would be
tailored to Israel\'s military needs. Four have already been delivered,
with two yet to come.

The Dolphins are surrounded by controversy, because experts have raised
the questions of whether the submarines could be outfitted with nuclear
warheads that Israel could use as a deterrent to stave off aggressions
from Iran.

\"If there was proof for this, the German government would have to
investigate,\" Christian Mölling, expert for security and defense with
the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told DW.
\"Because then it wouldn\'t just be an arms deal, it would be nuclear
proliferation. But I think [because it\'s Israel and it\'s such a
special case]{.underline}, some people on the German side would be more
likely to look the other way.\"

Learning the art of asymmetric warfare

The German forces profit from the close security partnership as well.
[The military leases surveillance drones from the Israeli army, the
Israel Defense Forces]{.underline} (IDF). And soldiers from the German
Bundeswehr traveled to Israel to learn the ways of asymmetric warfare
from their IDF colleagues.

The Israelis have a lot more experience with fighting opponents who use
non-traditional means like road bombs and who hide among civilian
populations. The German soldiers were able to put this training to use
in their deployment in Afghanistan, where they had to fight insurgents
using a similar approach.

The fact that this training cooperation was even possible shows just how
far the relationship between Germany and Israel has come in the last 70
years.

\"In 1965, 20 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, it was
inconceivable that an Israeli government would have let German soldiers
enter the country who were old enough to have fought in the Wehrmacht
\[the Nazi forces,\" Tempel said. \"[That cooperation on the security
level was possible at all is due to the improvement of political
relations over time.\"]{.underline}

Valuable ship deal

And the close partnership continues to be profitable for both sides. On
Monday, [Germany and Israel agreed on a deal that will see Germany sell
four warships to its partner. T]{.underline}he Corvettes will cost a
total of 430 million Euro (\$479 million). [According to a statement by
the Israeli defense ministry, Israel plans to use the small warships to
defend its offshore energy assets, the gas fields off the Israeli
coast]{.underline}.

Berlin will fund 115 million Euro (\$128 million) of the package.
[Defense expert Mölling said such a subsidy isn\'t common and chalked it
up to the special relationship between the two countries]{.underline}.

The German company ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems is supposed to deliver
the ships within the next five years.

### 1nc -- israel supports itself

#### Israel's DIB is strong -- means they don't need US support

**Frantzman 5-23**-2019,

(Seth J. Frantzman, Seth Frantzman has been covering conflict in the
Middle East since 2010 as a researcher, analyst and correspondent for
different publications) \"Israel's revolutionary defense industry,\" The

[Elbit Systems is Israel's largest defense company and frequently ranks
among the most important in the world]{.underline}. In 2018, it was the
27th most important company in its defense field by revenue globally. It
is a key part of Israel's hi-tech and groundbreaking defense technology
sector that has made Israel the eighth most important country in defense
supplies.\
\
In terms of what Israel excels at, weapons platforms such as air
defense, improving communications technology and unmanned aircraft
systems, including electro-optical imaging, Elbit is integral to the
whole ethos of what makes Israel unique.

[Elbit describes itself as an "international high technology company
engaged in a wide range of defense, homeland security and commercial
programs around the world."]{.underline}\
\
[It's in the news frequently, most recently for a \$30 million
high-precision guided mortar sale in Asia, and a new partnership with
DA-Group to produce and market Elbit Systems' Immune Satellite
Navigation System (iSNS).]{.underline}\
\
[This confronts the threat posed by GPS jamming, which has affected
Finland and Scandinavian countries.]{.underline}\
\
[Technology is a key part of war fighting today. The long-arc of the
history of warfare has gone through several technological revolutions,
from developments like radar in the 1930s to the Revolution in Military
Affairs that theorized dominance based on technology. Today's challenge
is even more sophisticated, harnessing every technology to make weapons
more precise and armies more aware.]{.underline}\
\
[To understand how Elbit is changing both the Israeli defense market and
the world, the Magazine spoke to Joseph Gaspar, Elbit Systems executive
vice president and chief financial officer.]{.underline}

THE DISCUSSION came in the wake of [Elbit announcing \$3.68b. in
revenues for 2018]{.underline}. It also comes in the wake of a long and
important acquisition Elbit made of IMI Systems.\
\
The world is changing in terms of its needs for military equipment. Many
countries that suffer from antiquated weaponry want the technology that
Israel has that helps them upgrade things like bombs to turn those
"dumb" munitions into smart bombs that are more precise. High-level
defense equipment is so expensive, like the US F-35, that countries want
to be able to improve what they already have.\
\
There are also tensions between Russia and NATO that drive defense
spending, and the US pressure for NATO countries to increase their
support for the alliance.\
\
The decline of ISIS hasn't meant the end of the war on terror. Instead,
the ISIS threat has spread throughout the Sahel in Africa and to south
Asia, with the attack in Sri Lanka and other networks. Iran is also on
the march and raising tensions in the Middle East.

In every case it is technology of the kind Israel excels at, that is
often needed to help check these adversaries.\
\
Companies like Elbit want to balance their increasing importance in the
US defense market, the largest defense spender in the world, with the
rest of the world. For instance, the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute revealed in late April that global defense spending
increased to \$1.8 trillion in 2018, 2.6% more than in 2017.\
\
The US and China are among the largest spenders, but India, Saudi
Arabia, France, Russia, the UK and Germany are in the top 10 as well.\
Israel doesn't sell to all of these countries, but it sells to many
important countries and developing countries.

After announcing \$3.68 billion in revenues in 2018, can you describe a
bit about Elbit's acquisition of IMI in terms of how it will impact the
company's approach going forward?\
\
"I would say that it was a long process \[acquiring IMI\]. We were in
negotiations with the \[Israeli\] government for over two years and
finally it happened in November last year \[2018\]. We have a basic
strategy of growing the business organically and looking for
acquisitions -- which we did quite a lot over the years in Israel and
abroad. IMI is one more acquisition in Israel that we did to comply with
what we think is very strategic for the company, which is growth of our
portfolio of technology, products and solutions to offer to customers in
Israel and internationally.\
\
"Our strategy in acquisition is to enlarge the portfolio and acquire
strategic positions in countries and get better access to customers. IMI
was categorized in the first part of that. IMI was a government-owned
operation with \$500m. revenues, give or take, and it was a losing
operation. The government was subsidizing them and helping them in many
ways, but they were not profitable. We started at the low level and had
to bring them all the way up to the level of profitability of Elbit. We
have done that in the past.

"One example was ELISRA, an electronics warfare company from Bnei Brak.
They had \$350m. in revenues and were losing money when we acquired them
in 2007. Today, we have built a lot of synergy, and ELISRA is at the
profitability rate of the whole organization. It took us several years,
but we are there.\
\
"We have three major product lines at IMI: precision munitions;
short-to-medium and long-range rockets; and defense systems for armored
vehicles. All of them are product areas that Elbit did not have
offerings in prior to IMI. [The acquisition puts us in a new and
stronger position in the various markets where we are selling our
solutions."]{.underline}We see quite a lot of synergy potential with the
IMI capabilities that we will be able to offer our customers:
[integrated solutions for ground-based armored vehicles, and integrated
artillery solutions that include guns, mortars, rockets and command and
control centers.]{.underline} In the past, we were not really able to
offer to our customers a wholly integrated one-project solution, but
with these capabilities from IMI we are able to offer that one-stop shop
for upgrade programs for armored vehicles, including the guns and the
protection systems for tanks and armored vehicles; artillery solutions;
and small 120 mm weaponry, including mortars; guns and rockets; medium,
long range and integrated artillery centers -- all of this combined to
provide integrated artillery defense solutions.

"[In addition, this enables us to provide to our customers with
integrated intel and recon systems that we had before]{.underline},
these are usually airborne on vehicles and other airborne platforms, but
once we have the capability from IMI we have precision guided munitions
to close the loop quickly once the target is detected and identified and
can be hit with guided precision munition.

"As we all know the precision munition is important in these days in the
modern world. We cannot be part of any munition that has collateral
damage or civilian damage accuracy and the whole world is going toward
this solution in time and location, this is extremely important and
IMI's solutions are very effective.\
\
"We see significant potential from our market presence. [Elbit derives
20% of our revenues from the Israeli market and 80% from international
markets.]{.underline} IMI is the other way around: 17% from
international markets and over 80% from the Israeli market. So [we
identify a potential to expand that business to the international
market, leveraging our worldwide presence and good relationship with
customers internationally.]{.underline} We expect the IMI portfolio do
derive 60% of its revenues internationally within several years, without
reducing its position in Israel.

"With the acquisition of IMI, we believe we are in a different category
of defense companies. [We are now in the \$4-5b. revenues range with a
10b. backlog of orders, which is higher than before]{.underline}. With
IMI, we will have a third of our business in Israel for the coming years
and about a quarter in Europe, US and Asia-Pacific each. So we have a
diversified portfolio and nicely balanced customer base, which minimizes
business risk, as defense budgets may decline or grow in some areas in
world, but worldwide there is growth. Also, [our broad portfolio of
products and solutions gives us a solid position.]{.underline} If I
compare us to our peers in the US, who are on average 80% US-based and
20% international, we see a lower risk situation for Elbit .

"WE RESTRUCTURED the company after the acquisition to five business
units in addition to our US operations.

"We split the land and C4I division into two. The Land Division, which
includes IMI, will be focused on land solutions that include armored
vehicles, artillery and ammunition. The C4 and Cyber division is focused
on command, control, communications, computers, radio and cyber
business. "In addition, we have the iSTAR Division, including the UAV
and electro-optic business and the airborne and the EW business
(ELISRA). In each business division, we are well focused and consider
ourselves as one of the three leading companies in the area from the
point of view of products, technology and customer base.

"From the operations point of view, IMI is very advanced
technologically. They had very good people in some areas, but they were
losing money. So what we did -- and we are only three months in the game
-- we significantly reduced the head count of the operations, by several
hundred people, many of them close to retirement. We accelerated that
process a bit and we restructured the IMI business into strategic units
along the lines above, such as defense for armored vehicles, rockets and
precision munitions.

"We will build a new and modern production facility in the Negev that
will be essentially funded by Israeli government, this will help us
reduce production costs and increase profitability. We are also planning
to integrate IMI into our ERP (enterprise resource planning) system.
That will help reduce inventory, improve cash flow and improve the
operating aspect of the business in production and engineering."We plan
to strengthen international marketing within IMI and help it with
Elbit's international worldwide marketing networks to enhance its
position internationally and come close to our 80% to 20% ratios in
Elbit. We provided financial support to IMI, which for years was in a
bad position financially with credit lines that hurt them in delivering
the goods and services.

"We will integrate them in our overall corporate procurement
organization so they can take advantage of the scale of Elbit in the
purchasing process. "All of that has started to happen. It will take a
bit of time until we see results, but we plan to bring IMI to
profitability already in 2019. Trying to bring them to the average level
of Elbit is not a target we will be able to achieve in months -- it
could take a couple of years -- but it will grow and we will reach it.
The growth from the international market business will help improve
profitability."

Can we discuss how this impacts the US market?"We consider the US market
our second domestic market due to volume and importance. When we are
successful in US, we can be successful worldwide. We have approximately
1,700 employees in several locations there; the largest is in Fort
Worth, Texas. We also have production and engineering capabilities in
New Hampshire and other places.

"We operate there under an SSA (special security agreement with the US
Department of Defense), so we are considered as any other US operation
or company that can take upon itself classified programs. This is where
we are. IMI was not very active in the US prior to the acquisition,
although they had some business there.

"Recently, IMI was successful with the US army, to adopt to their
Bradley platform the armored vehicle defense system of IMI (IRON FIST).
This is the first major program. We expect in the next few months to get
a contract and be able to supply systems for evaluations. Hopefully,
they will perform well and that opens a path for the future for IMI in
the US.

"In 2018, we continued to supply helmets for pilots of the F-35 and
other fighter aircrafts. We won a new position on the F-35, the central
display unit in the cockpit. [Lockheed Martin selected us and that is a
significant win for future F-35 production.]{.underline} We are involved
in other things that we can't release information about, but in the next
several months we will be able to deliver that to the market. [Our
products are in the cockpits of fighters and helicopters, including
mission computers, displays, maps and a lot of equipment that goes on
the major fighting aircraft and platforms.]{.underline}

["We are well positioned on the F-16 and F-18 for the US Air Force and
Navy and we have positions on the F-15, the V-22, the Apache, Black
Hawks and Bradley's. So we feel very comfortable in the US; business is
good and growing there.]{.underline} We are also the prime contractor on
the IFT, the electronic wall between Arizona and Mexico, we are the
prime contractor providing towers along the border and on those towers a
lot of sensors, radar, night vision, day vision and these are coupled to
command and control centers. So when they detect an intrusion they
analyze it and give guidance to the forces to check it and do what they
do. We are a prime contractor. It costs several hundreds of millions
\[of dollars\] to set it up. The customer is happy; we are waiting for
further decisions on this active issue."

What is next in other markets, such as Europe and Asia?

"In the European market, we see growth in defense budgets, driven by
several factors, such as the perceived challenge from the east or
immigration from Africa and the Middle East, which creates challenges to
internal security. All of this creates a good business environment for
solutions that we have in defense electronics, border control and
upgrades for systems, including recon and intel systems, cyber
solutions, and so on. They are appreciated by many of the European
countries."We are well-positioned in the UK; Elbit operates five
subsidiaries employing hundreds of people, acting locally and doing
interesting work. That is a big market for us. We have customers in
Italy, Belgium, Austria, Romania, Germany and Switzerland, plus some
Scandinavian countries as well. One of biggest UAS programs is with
Switzerland and one we had in the past was \[with\] the WatchKeeper and
the following in the UK. That market has grown to 22-23% of our
revenues.

"Defense budgets are growing in many countries in Asia-Pacific as well,
including in South Korea. Some countries in the Far East sense
challenges with what the Chinese are operating and they are buying
equipment. We have a major subsidiary in Australia and have provided
command and control solutions and night vision equipment for ground
forces.

"Other growing markets include India, which has a huge defense market
with growing needs, without addressing specifics.

["Generally speaking, we are facing a positive environment with an
increasing need for internal and external security.]{.underline} The one
continent that it is a little on the low side is Latin America. It used
to account for over 10% of our revenues but now is down to 5-6%. Still,
our position there is good, in Brazil, for example, and we hope the
region will return to growth.

"In Israel, our position is even stronger with IMI and we get our share
of the cake."

[China's official press has also highlighted its aid to
Palestine]{.underline}, with official press agencies [calling its
economic and humanitarian aid "an important expression of China's
support for the Middle East peace process]{.underline}." Such
statements, however, have often been disingenuous about the scale of
China's donations. According to Dr. Miyagi, **[it gave just \$11 million
of the \$7.4 billion pledged]{.underline}** by the international
community at the 2007 International Donors' Conference [for
Palestine.]{.underline}

**[To expect larger aid contributions --- or more action --- likely
misinterprets China's intentions as a global power]{.underline}**.
Although China's increasing international stature has been the subject
of considerable speculation, [specialists on its foreign policy insist
that it has few ambitions towards the kind of global interventionist
role that the US has played as a superpower]{.underline}. While [China
has massive economic clout as a state, the everyday wealth of its people
is still just a fraction of that of most Americans]{.underline} or
Europeans. Rather, according to Dr. Miyagi, C[hina's priority has become
the maintenance of a stable world order which will supply it with
uninterrupted raw materials and energy, and continue to buy its
products]{.underline}.

[If there are actors hoping that China might offer an alternative to US
hegemony]{.underline} and pushing the international community [into a
more just position on Palestine]{.underline}, [it is not likely to
happen soon]{.underline} --- if ever. As Dr. Miyagi points out,
[Palestine occupies a symbolic position for]{.underline} both
[China]{.underline} as a former revolutionary state and for China's Arab
economic partners. **[However, Palestine itself has no oil and only a
tiny consumer market to offer]{.underline}**. While [China may provide
balance to the US's constant pro-Israel positions]{.underline} at the UN
and other international arenas, [the days of]{.underline} its
unequivocal **[support for Palestinian rights are]{.underline}**, it
seems, **[long gone]{.underline}**.

[The United States insisted that Israel cut off the HARPY
deal]{.underline}. In addition, it demanded the resignation of senior
MOD officials and an agreement---or "understandings," [according to
Israelis---that all defense transfers and dual-use exports to China be
subject to U.S. approval]{.underline}. These additional consultation
mechanisms between the [U.S. Department of State]{.underline} and the
Israeli MOD "[put an end to China-Israel defense technology
relations]{.underline}."35 The HARPY incident gave rise to Israel's 2007

Political and Military Relations

[Netanyahu has repeatedly expressed his hope that broader economic
relations with China would translate to more alignment]{.underline} at
the United Nations. [This has happened in the case of India, whose trade
with Israel has surged in the last two decades]{.underline}. Following
this uptick in trade, India, on several occasions in recent years,
[abandoned its previous pattern of voting with Arab states against
Israel in the UN]{.underline} system. However, China has not changed its
voting pattern, and it aligns against Israel whenever there is a vote in
the UN bodies.

Israel's growing relationship with [India also includes significant arms
sales, but that is not true with China.]{.underline} While Chinese navy
ships have docked in Israel, **[arms sales and military cooperation are
limited due to U.S. pressure.]{.underline}**

In 2004, the George W. Bush administration demanded that Israel renege
on its pledge to upgrade the Harpy missile system, which Israel
Aerospace Industries (IAI) had sold to China in 1994 for about \$55
million. [U.S. officials cited security concerns and]{.underline}
claimed [the missile system]{.underline} contained American technology.
Israeli officials denied the allegations, and IAI followed through on
contractual commitments to China.

As a result, the United States suspended Israel from the Joint Strike
Fighter (JSF) project---which led to what is now known as the F-35
stealth fighter---and demanded the resignation of General Amos Yaron,
the Israeli Defense Ministry's director general. Israel did return to
the JSF a few months later but at considerable cost: The Defense
Ministry had to establish a department for overseeing defense exports,
and the director general did in fact retire. [The U.S.-Israel military
relationship includes exercises, intelligence sharing, and \$3.8 billion
in U.S. military aid, and]{.underline} **[the United States remains in a
powerful position to curtail Israeli military sales]{.underline}** to
China.

#### **internal link xt -- Israel provides access to critical tech key to outpacing china**

investment, but the money keeps rolling in", South China Morning Post, 3

"Many [Israeli companies have unique technologies but they are very
small and lack resources,]{.underline} so it's kind of a good
cooperation. **[In the past, Israeli firms tended to look to the West
for funding, but now many of them look to China."]{.underline}**

While much of the cooperation came in the form of direct investment,
Levi said a growing number of Israeli firms were heading to China to
form joint ventures, raising intellectual property rights issues.

As **[Washington and Beijing continue to fight a tech
war]{.underline}**, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Israel's
Channel 13 recently that [countries needed to be "wide-eyed and awake"
to the risk posed by China, or face potential repercussions such as
reduced intelligence sharing with the US.]{.underline}

During a closed-door meeting at Tel Aviv University in January, Nadav
Argaman, head of Israel's security agency Shin Bet, called for the
establishment of an oversight mechanism on Chinese investments, local
broadcaster Channel 10 reported. As examples, [he cited the operation by
a state-owned Chinese company of parts of Haifa port, the largest of
Israel's three major seaports]{.underline}, and a Chinese construction
company building a light rail system in Tel Aviv.

**["Chinese influence in Israel is particularly dangerous in terms of
strategic infrastructure and investments in larger
companies]{.underline}**," he was quoted as saying.

In January, Daniel Shapir, a former US ambassador to Israel, said in an
interview with local business newspaper Calcalist that [Israeli
start-ups would face "real repercussions" when trying to take their
technologies to the US market if they had a significant Chinese investor
component.]{.underline}

Nonetheless, Israeli investors remain largely bullish on the future of
tech cooperation with China. Ehud Levy, co-founder and general partner
at Canaan Partners Israel, which focuses on early-stage tech
investments, said [it was increasingly difficult for Chinese investors
to put their money in the US because]{.underline} of CFIUS restrictions,
[so they were turning to Israel]{.underline}, and the world's "second
Silicon Valley".

While there had been board discussions about whether Israeli companies
should accept Chinese investors, deals still went through if the Chinese
source was deemed reputable, he said.

"There is a discussion, there is kind of a buzz about it," he said. "I'm
not concerned. I think it's a kind of short-term bug that will not
affect things in the long-term because there is an intrinsic economic
value, and [there is good synergy between Israeli innovation and the
needs in China."]{.underline}

Yang said he did not think the Israeli government would even agree to a
CFIUS-like mechanism as it would hurt start-ups' funding options and
their ability to enter the Chinese market.

### 2nc xt -- lobbying -- no solvency

**Plan fails -- organizations lobby Congress to maintain support for
israel**

**Mearsheimer and Walt 06** (John J. Mearsheimer, Stephen M. Walt, Dr.

2006, [[http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/IsraelLobby.pdf]{.underline}](http://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/IsraelLobby.pdf) -BIB)

Strategies for Success The [lobby pursues two broad]{.underline}
strategies to promote U.S. support for Israel. First, it wields
significant influence in Washington, pressuring both Congress and the
Executive Branch to support Israel down the line. Whatever an individual
lawmaker or policy maker\'s own views, the lobby tries to make
supporting Israel the \"smart\" political choice[. Second, the lobby
strives to ensure that public discourse about Israel portrays it in a
positive light, by repeating myths about Israel and its founding and by
publicizing Israel\'s side in the policy debates of the
day.]{.underline} The goal is to prevent critical commentary about
Israel from getting a fair hearing in the political arena. [Controlling
the debate is essential to guaranteeing U.S. support, because a candid
discussion of U.S.-Israeli relations might lead Americans to favor a
different policy.]{.underline} Influencing Congress A key pillar of the
lobby\'s effectiveness is its influence [in the U.S.
Congress]{.underline}, where [Israel is virtually immune from
criticism]{.underline}. [This is in itself a remarkable]{.underline}
situation, [because Congress almost never shies away from contentious
issues.]{.underline} Whether the issue is abortion, affirmative action,
health care or welfare, there is certain to be a lively debate on
Capitol Hill. Where Israel is concerned, however, potential critics fall
silent; there is hardly any debate at all. [One reason for the lobby\'s
success with Congress is that some key members are \"Christian
Zionists\" like Dick Armey, who said]{.underline} in September 2002,
[\"My number-one priority in foreign policy is to protect
Israel.\"]{.underline}76 One would think that the number-one priority
for any congressman would be to \"protect America,\" but that is not
what Armey said. [There are also Jewish senators and congressmen who
work to make U.S. foreign policy support Israel\'s interests. Pro-Israel
congressional staffers are another source of the lobby\'s
power.]{.underline} As Morris Amitay, a former head of AIPAC, once
noted, \"There are a lot of guys at the working level up here \[on
Capitol Hill\] ... who happen to be Jewish, who are willing ... to look
at certain issues in terms of their Jewishness .... These are all guys
who are in a position to make the decision in these areas for those
senators .... You can get an awful lot done just at the staff level.\"
77 It is [AIPAC]{.underline} itself, however, that [forms the core of
the lobby\'s influence in Congress]{.underline}.78 AIPAC\'s success is
[due to its ability to reward legislators and congressional candidates
who support its agenda and to punish those who challenge
it.]{.underline} Money is critical to U.S. elections (as the recent
scandal over lobbyist Jack Abramoff\'s various shady dealings reminds
us), and [AIPAC makes sure that its friends get financial support from
the myriad proIsrael political action committees. Those seen as hostile
to Israel, on the other hand, can be sure that AIPAC will direct
campaign contributions to their political opponents. AIPAC also
organizes letter-writing campaigns and encourages newspaper editors to
endorse pro-Israel candidates.]{.underline} There is no doubt about the
potency of these tactics. To take but one example, [in 1984, AIPAC
helped defeat Senator Charles Percy from Illinois, who]{.underline},
according to one prominent lobby figure, [had \"displayed insensitivity
and even hostility to our concerns.\"]{.underline} Thomas Dine, the head
of AIPAC at the time, explained what happened: \"All the Jews in
America, from coast to coast, gathered to oust Percy. And the American
politicians --- those who hold public positions now, and those who
aspire --- got the message.\" 79 Other U.S. politicians who have felt
AIPAC\'s wrath include former representatives Paul Findley (R-IL), Pete
McCloskey (R-CA), Cynthia McKinney (D-GA), and James Moran (DVA), just
to name a few.80 One could also include Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY),
whose support for Palestinian statehood and public embrace of Suha
Arafat (wife of Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser
Arafat) provoked strong criticism from groups in the lobby. Not
surprisingly, Clinton became an ardent defender of Israel once she began
running for office herself.81 AIPAC prizes its reputation as a
formidable adversary, of course, because this discourages anyone from
questioning its agenda. [AIPAC\'s influence on Capitol Hill goes even
further]{.underline}, however. [According to Douglas Bloomfield, a
former AIPAC staff member, **\"It is common for members of Congress and
their staffs to turn to AIPAC first when they need information, before
calling the Library of Congress, the Congressional Research Service,
committee staff or administration experts.\"**]{.underline} 82 More
important, he notes that AIPAC is \"often called upon to draft speeches,
work on legislation, advise on tactics, perform research, collect
co-sponsors and marshal votes.\" The bottom line is that
[AIPAC]{.underline}, which bills itself as \"America\'s Pro-Israel
Lobby,\" [has an unchallenged hold on the U.S. Congress.]{.underline}83
Open debate about U.S. policy towards Israel does not occur there, even
though that policy has important consequences for the entire world.
Thus, one of the three main branches of the U.S. government is firmly
committed to supporting Israel. As former Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC)
noted as he was leaving office, \"You can\'t have an Israeli policy
other than what AIPAC gives you around here.\" 84 Small wonder that
former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon once told an American
audience, \"When people ask me how they can help Israel, I tell them ---
help AIPAC.\" His successor, Ehud Olmert, agrees, remarking, \"Thank God
we have AIPAC, the greatest supporter and friend we have in the whole
world.\" 85 Influencing the Executive [The lobby also has significant
leverage over the Executive Branch. That power derives in part from the
influence Jewish voters have on presidential elections.]{.underline}
Despite their small numbers in the population (less than 3 percent),
[Jewish-Americans make large campaign donations to candidates from both
parties. The Washington Post once estimated that Democratic presidential
candidates \"depend on Jewish supporters to supply as much as 60 percent
of the money.\"]{.underline} 86 Furthermore, Jewish voters have high
turn-out rates and are concentrated in key states like California,
Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. This increases
their weight in determining electoral outcomes. Because they matter in
close elections, presidential candidates try not to antagonize Jewish
voters. [Key organizations in the lobby also directly target the
administration in power. For example, pro-Israel forces make sure that
critics of the Jewish state do not get important foreign-policy
appointments. Jimmy Carter wanted to make George Ball his first
secretary of state, but he knew that Ball was perceived as critical of
Israel and that the lobby would oppose the appointment.]{.underline}87
This litmus test encourages any aspiring policy maker to become an overt
supporter of Israel (or at the very least, to refrain from criticizing
U.S. support for Israel). Thus, public critics of Israeli policy have
become an endangered species in the U.S. foreign policy establishment.
These constraints still operate today. [When 2004 presidential candidate
Howard Dean called for the United States to take a more \"even-handed
role\" in the Arab-Israeli conflict, Senator Joseph Lieberman accused
him of selling Israel down the river and said his statement was
\"irresponsible.\"]{.underline} 88 Virtually [all of the top Democrats
in the House of Representatives signed a hard-hitting letter to Dean
criticizing his comments]{.underline}, and [The Chicago Jewish Star
reported that \"anonymous attackers ... are clogging the e-mail inboxes
of Jewish leaders around the country, warning --- without much evidence
--- that Dean would somehow be bad for Israel.\"]{.underline} 89 This
worry was absurd, however, because Dean is in fact quite hawkish on
Israel.90 His campaign co-chair was a former AIPAC president, and Dean
said his own views on the Middle East more closely reflected those of
AIPAC than of the more moderate Americans for Peace Now. [Dean had
merely suggested that to \"bring the sides together,\" Washington should
act as an honest broker. This is hardly a radical idea, but it is
anathema to the lobby, which does not tolerate the idea of
even-handedness when it comes to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The lobby\'s
goals are also served when pro-Israel individuals occupy important
positions in the Executive Branch. During the Clinton administration,
for example, Middle East policy was largely shaped by officials with
close ties to Israel or to prominent pro-Israel
organizations]{.underline} --- including Martin Indyk, the former deputy
director of research at AIPAC and cofounder of the pro-Israel Washington
Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP); Dennis Ross, who joined WINEP
after leaving government in 2001; and Aaron Miller, who has lived in
Israel and often visits there.91 These men were among President
Clinton\'s closest advisors at the Camp David summit in July 2000.
Although all three supported the Oslo peace process and favored creation
of a Palestinian state, they did so only within the limits of what would
be acceptable to Israel.92 In particular, [the American delegation took
most of its cues from Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, coordinated
negotiating positions with Israel in advance, and did not offer its own
independent proposals for settling the conflict. Not surprisingly,
Palestinian negotiators complained that]{.underline} 45 MEARSHEIMER AND
WALT: THE ISRAEL LOBBY [they were \"negotiating with two Israeli teams
--- one displaying an Israeli flag, and one an American
flag.\"]{.underline} 93 The situation is even more pronounced in the
Bush administration, whose ranks have included fervently pro-Israel
individuals like Elliot Abrams, John Bolton, Douglas Feith, I. Lewis
(\"Scooter\") Libby, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz and David Wurmser. As
we shall see, these officials consistently pushed for policies favored
by Israel and backed by organizations in the lobby.

BIB)

[Cultural perspectives and conflict]{.underline}

As with other cultures and groups[, Arab and Israeli conflict patterns
have both rational and non-rational components. Non-rational or
**emotive factors**, such as fear and loathing, or imperatives of
upholding honour, fulfilling ancient narratives and myths, and
overcoming or avenging historical traumas, **can be** seen as **less
amenable to**]{.underline} negotiation than **[concrete
issues]{.underline}** such as prisoner exchanges or the division of
resources, **[and may challenge hopes for reconciliation]{.underline}**.
Among so-called [rational or pragmatic interests are financial concerns,
security provisions, political, individual and group]{.underline}
(including family) [empowerment]{.underline}. Indeed, some [concrete
issues, such as division of land, take on spiritual and mythical as well
as historic meanings]{.underline} for various groups or subgroups and
retard mutual accord. Thus **[issues of territory]{.underline}**, so
pertinent to most wars5 [have elements of both emotion and pragmatics
because territory is so **highly symbolic of** both **group identity**
and security interests, as well as economic and resource
concerns]{.underline}. However, both rational and non-rational factors
can be and have been successfully negotiated and must be acknowledged
and treated in conflict resolution processes. Such factors influencing
negotiation outcomes are common for nearly all world cultures, but what
may distinguish some cultures from others are the cognitive lenses
through which they see and interpret these motives, symbols and
interests, as well as opponents' actions. We have learned that historic
experience and prevailing norms and philosophical principles play a
large role in such interpretations. It is, of course, an
oversimplification to label any large group as one 'culture', or perhaps
worse, 'civilization'.6 Among Arabs, for example, are many regional and
sectarian subcultures -- the Bedouin, Berber, Druze; the villager,
nomad, or city dweller; the North African, Levantine, or Southwest Asian
-- along with religious variations between Sunni, Shi'a, Alawi, Zaidis,
Christian Chaldean, Orthodox, Maronite, Coptic, etc. Tribal, [clan and
ancestral customs and practices can mean a great deal in settling local
feuds and in laying conditions for mutual accommodation and
coexistence.]{.underline} Yet so can overarching commonalities among all
or most of the subcultures themselves, commonalities such as the
importance of honour, 'face', status, and justice/ injustice
interpretations. Similarly, [Jews,]{.underline} while [united by many
cultural characteristics and **memes**]{.underline}, also diverge among
and within ethnic (Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Beta Israeli Amharic, etc.),
secular and religious (sects of Chasidic, Reconstructionist,
Conservative, Neolog, Haredi, etc.) groupings. Social practices may
differ slightly or markedly between these communities and [it
is]{.underline} sometimes **[difficult for one subgroup to fully accept
the validity of another]{.underline}** -- as when Orthodox authorities
refuse to accept Reform marriage, worship, or conversion rites. Yet both
Arabs and Jews may unite across many of these lines to oppose
'outsiders'

## framing

### 1nc -- a2: set col framing

#### a "settler colonial" paradigm is a form of cognitive denial that severs cultural and historical connections to Israel and refutes the notion of Jews as a legitimate people.

BIB)

Language and Perception: "[Settler-Colonialism]{.underline}"

[Despite the essentially parallel processes of independence from
colonial and protectorate influence]{.underline} over the first half of
the twentieth century, only one of the national movements at the time
and only one of the resulting states, namely [Israel, is accused of
being "colonial.]{.underline}" [The accusation]{.underline} of
colonialism [against Israel is not without difficulty]{.underline}.
Since [the traditional definition of colonialists exploiting the native
population and resources does not broadly apply to Jews]{.underline} and
Zionism, [how then, to continue the narrative of Israeli
colonialism]{.underline}? The answer [was the application of another
type of colonialism]{.underline}, that [of the
"settler-colonialist]{.underline}," to the Zionist enterprise.31

[This term]{.underline}, however, [can assume validity **only if** it is
assumed that **the "settlers" have no indigenous roots and rights in the
area**]{.underline}. As such, [this is]{.underline} yet **[another use
of language to shape perceptions and another example of psychological
manipulation for political purposes]{.underline}**. [Unlike any other
"settler-colonial" state]{.underline} in history, Israel stands alone in
that [there is no identifiable foreign power that can be identified as
the colonial entity]{.underline}. It goes without saying that the notion
of **["settler" also dismisses any historical or biblical connection of
Jews to the area]{.underline}**. Hence, the importance of [denial of
Jewish rights, history, and claims to the area.]{.underline}

The notion of [Israeli colonialism]{.underline}, however, [is so
established in certain academic and political circles that **its
colonial identity is never questioned**, and "settlers" are
automatically considered agents of a colonial effort]{.underline}.32

[Lest there be any confusion about what a "settler" is,]{.underline}
despite the impression of some that the term applies only to those
Israelis who have established communities in disputed territory after
1967, [those who use the terminology "settler-colonialist" against
Israel clearly mean the entire Zionist enterprise, including the
original territory of the State of Israel]{.underline} in 1948.33 In
fact, many contemporary [Palestinian activists]{.underline} blithely and
routinely [assume, in their writing, that all Israelis are colonialists
and all of "historic" Palestine has been occupied]{.underline} (e.g.,
Qumsiyeh,34 Abunimah35).

Reestablishing Accuracy: [Cognitive Dissonance and Confirmation
Bias]{.underline}

The **["colonial Israel" charge is thus rooted in an ideological and
cognitive denial of any Jewish connection to]{.underline}** Palestine
and the ancient Land of **[Israel]{.underline}**. This can be either
[through a belief that the connection is weak because of the passage of
time]{.underline},36 or, as has been the case in Arab circles and in
some revisionist Israeli ones,37 **[by flatly denying Jewish roots in
the area.]{.underline}**

Cognitive dissonance is the phenomenon whereby established beliefs are
challenged by new, conflicting information that arouses a challenge to
those core beliefs. Confirmation bias, on the other hand, is the term
applied to seeking evidence that validates prior attitudes and beliefs.
[When confronted with dissonance, some may alter their beliefs to
conform to the new information]{.underline}, but many, especially [those
that are ideologically invested with and committed to a particular view,
continue in their established attitudes by adding justifications or
interpretations that support or "confirm" the original
cognition.]{.underline}

[Just as committed Zionists would not accept a colonial narrative**,
presenting facts and arguments in response to accusations against Israel
would not change attitudes**]{.underline} for anti-Zionists, even when
their core beliefs or attitudes feeding that position are challenged. In
practice, **[ideologues seem to respond to challenges through
"confirmation bias,"]{.underline}** [seeking information consistent with
their ideology]{.underline} that supports their core beliefs when
dissonance is aroused.38 [Attempting to change attitude]{.underline}s,
thus, [would appear to have a chance for success only]{.underline}
**[when these attempts target those who are not predispositioned or
biased towards particular political ideologies]{.underline}** and when
the information is accurate, not tendentious, and based on solid data.

The mechanism of dissonance reduction that is most central to [the
"settler-colonialist" argument is the notion that]{.underline} **[Jews
do not constitute a national entity and thus cannot possibly have
legitimate rights]{.underline}** to what was known as Palestine. For
those who are familiar with [Jewish history and traditions, such as the
specifics of the Jewish legal system applicable only in Israel or the
role of the "Land of Israel" in Jewish liturgy]{.underline}, the
speciousness of [these notions is self-evident]{.underline}. For many
others, however, t[his is either not recognized or not
relevant]{.underline}.39 **[Challenging these beliefs involves two
overlapping mechanisms:]{.underline}** First[**, a firm recognition of
the reality of Jewish roots** and historical sovereignty in the
area]{.underline}, and second, **[an acknowledgment that the modern
reconstitution of Jewish nationalism was achieved through a legitimate
process]{.underline}** [consistent with international law and the right
to self-determination]{.underline}. Both **[tenets are taboo and are not
even subject to discussion]{.underline}** for many anti-Zionist
ideologues.

[Ideology, when unyielding and unbending, will be resistant to any
cognitive dissonance]{.underline}.40 That is why, **[despite the
historical record, the core notion of Israel as a "settler-colonialist"
nation will continue to resonate in circles where nationalism is frowned
upon, where religious history is irrelevant, where post-modern
ideologies are entrenched and philosophically embraced, and where the
notion of Jews as a people is not recognized.]{.underline}**

[Historical continuity with pre-colonial]{.underline} and/or pre-settler

communities. (United Nations, n.d., para. 3) Naturally, this definition
makes no judgment on the existence of a multiplicity of Indigenous
peoples within a given space; it merely demonstrates the generally
agreed-upon criteria that pertains to Indigenous Peoples across the
world. It is apparent then that many [Palestinian Arabs consider this
definition to apply to themselves, but deny its reciprocal application
to the Jews]{.underline}, ergo **[invalidating any claims to Jewish
self-determination]{.underline}**. However, official Palestinian
Authority media frequently denies Jewish indigeneity in the territory of
historic Eretz Yisrael (Land of Israel)/Palestine. [Such pronouncements
are mainstream within Palestinian political discourse]{.underline}. For
instance, on May 14, 2011, Abdallah AlIfranji, an advisor to Palestinian
president Mahmoud Abbas, relayed words on behalf of the President, where
he remarked: National reconciliation \[between Hamas and Fatah\] is
required in order to face Israel and Netanyahu. We say to him
\[Netanyahu\], when he claims -- that they \[Jews\] have a historical
right dating back to 3,000 years BCE -- we say that the nation of
Palestine upon the land of Canaan had a 7,000-year history BCE. This is
the truth, which must be understood and we have to note it, in order to
say: "Netanyahu, you are incidental in history. We are the people of
history. We are the owners of history." (Palestinian Media Watch, 2011,
para. 2) [To buttress such arguments, Palestinian Arabs must expound
genealogical claims to Peoples who predate the Jewish
presence]{.underline} in the land. The premise of such
assertions---albeit with little evidence (Bukay, 2012)---involves, for
instance, a claim of descent to the Jebusites of ancient Canaan, the
original inhabitants of Jerusalem according to the Old Testament, [in an
effort to invalidate later Jewish claims]{.underline} to the city
(Wenkel, 2007). In other cases, Palestinians have orchestrated ritual
observances to the ancient god, Baal, as a purported demonstration of
their Canaanite heritage (Breger, 1997). By denying Jewish indigeneity
and inventing a supersessionist Palestinian Arab indigeneity, **[the
Palestinian political narrative has engaged in a form of cultural
appropriation as a tool by which to delegitimize the Zionist
enterprise]{.underline}** in its totality, [and sever Jewish connection
to the land]{.underline} (Bukay, 2012). As Bukay asserted, "\[[t\]his
fictitious history, which ignores all historical documentation and
established historical methods, is based on systematic distortions of
both ancient and modern history with the aim of denying Israel's right
to exist]{.underline}" (p. 23). Without prejudicing any claims of some
Palestinian Arabs on the subject of indigeneity, [Jewish attachment to
the land predates any documented Arab presence by
millennia]{.underline}. In fact, and again, without prejudicing any
justifiable Palestinian claims to national sovereignty or indigeneity of
their own, as Yahel et al. (2012) reminded, "**[Jews are the only nation
that can claim an uninterrupted presence on the land from biblical times
to date]{.underline}**---for a significant amount of the time as its
rulers" (p. 8). By extension of this fact, [the Jews have ties to the
land prior to the emergence of any imperial powers]{.underline} in the
modern era: The Land of Israel has a dual history, marked both by
constant waves of immigration and invasion by various peoples and
uninterrupted Jewish presence in the land from time immemorial. The Jews
have always considered the Land of Israel their national homeland, [have
lived in it as a sovereign nation in historical times, maintained at
least a toehold there despite persecution, and returned to it time and
again after being exiled]{.underline}. This [spiritual relationship is
also expressed in both Jewish daily prayers and Israel's Declaration of
Independence]{.underline}. (Yahel et al., 2012, p. 14) Of note, some
[Arab groups may have migrated to]{.underline}, and settled in, [the
land following the return of Jews from exile]{.underline} in 538 B.C.E.
It is well known that beginning in the seventh century, with the
expansion of various Islamic empires into the Levant, including
Palestine, came a variety of ethnic groups, including Arabs, but all
under the aegis of Islamic imperial rule from that point forward until
the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (Yahel et al., 2012). This
[history could reasonably provide descendants of those Arabs with
sufficient claims to national rights--- including Indigenous
rights---but not at the expense of the Jewish rights to the
same]{.underline}. At issue is not the supplanting of the rights of one
party over the other---**[there can be more than one Indigenous
population within a given territory]{.underline}**---but rather the
denial of Jewish indigeneity altogether. [Nor does such an
acknowledgment privilege one group to have dominion over
another]{.underline}---an important, but altogether separate discussion.
Acknowledging this history, one would have to take great pains [to
divest the Jewish People from their rightful Indigenous
heritage]{.underline} in the land. To do so [would demand a loosening of
the threshold required to make a reasonable claim to
indigeneity]{.underline}, **[which would actually serve to strengthen
the Jewish claim]{.underline}** versus its competitors (albeit, without
prejudicing those claims that could meet the threshold) (Yahel et al.,
2012). Thus, the view of the Jewish People as a distinct nation bound to
the land of Eretz Yisrael Palestine, both physically and spiritually, is
a well established, millennia-old trait. Important, however, is the fact
that **[such rhetorical distortions serve to exacerbate the current
intractability of the conflict between Israelis and
Palestinians.]{.underline}** According to Kriesberg (2003b), the
intractability, or persistence of a social conflict is influenced by
various factors, including [the belief or **perception that the goals of
one group** (i.e., Zionism) **contradicts the goals of another** (i.e.,
Palestinian]{.underline} Arab nationalism). Such conflicts are typified
by persistently destructive relationships despite efforts to positively
transform them by members of both sides of the conflict, as well as
third party mediators. Moreover, while not always the case, it is common
for intractable conflicts to be inherited and perpetuated
intergenerationally, **[which tends to further ossify the conflict and
make it more difficult to de-escalate]{.underline}** so as to pursue
some form of mutually acceptable peaceful outcome. Accordingly, the
reason such conflicts tend to be intractable is precisely because they
centre around issues of identity---involving both the perceptions social
groups in conflict have of themselves and their real, or perceived,
enemies. This perception informs how they relate to each other, how they
believe the conflict should be resolved, and how best to achieve that
end. In essence, [such conflicts are more typically zero-sum than
conflicts over mere material concerns in that the idea of compromise is
often seen as a price that is too high to pay and comes at the expense
of a core element of group identity]{.underline}---often [to the point
of feeling that the existence of one's group identity hinges on the
collective ability to resist compromise.]{.underline} As Kriesberg
wrote: Members of one or more sides in every conflict have grievances,
some of which contribute to intractability. [This is the case when
members of one side feel grossly wronged by the oppression and
injustices imposed by the other side, or feel that their very existence
is threatened. Such feelings tend to be found in conflicts that are
intractable]{.underline}. (Kriesberg, 2003b, para. 15)

Postcolonialism and Its Discontents

Thus far, it can be established that a [rejection of Jewish indigeneity
to the land requires the employment of fallacious history with the
rhetoric of decolonization]{.underline}. This involves the use of
politicized communications [to link the phenomenon of Zionism with
historical European settler colonialism through a post-colonialist and
postmodernist lens]{.underline} (Bukay, 2012). This is achieved through
the reductive ascription of complex social ills to the legacies of
imperialism and colonialism (Salzman, 2007), working retroactively to
illustrate a predetermined causal linkage. Therefore, without focusing
on the positive or negative consequences of history, the question
becomes whether Zionism is a form of Indigenous self-determination for
the Jewish People, or an illegitimate settler colonial project involving
the disenfranchising of an Indigenous population for the benefit of an
alien population. Given the ideological diversity within "Zionism"
(Jewish Virtual Library, n.d.a) at its most basic, a distilled
definition of [Zionism involves the commitment to the (re)establishment
of a Jewish national home in the Jewish People's historic
homeland]{.underline} (Eretz Yisrael/Palestine) in one fashion or
another (Jewish Virtual Library, n.d.b). The different ideas surrounding
how this type of national polity should emerge is beyond the scope of
our discussion, but essentially [it was an emancipation movement
emerging out of the European nationalistic milieu of the late 19th
century]{.underline} (Bareli, 2001), [aiming to assert Jewish
sovereignty and the creation of a Jewish body politic in at least
part]{.underline} of the ancient lands of [Israel]{.underline}. However,
[critics of Zionism consider it to be]{.underline} nothing more than a
form of [British facilitated colonial exploitation and dispossession by
foreigners]{.underline} to the land[, in order to]{.underline} establish
a polity that [asserts its dominance over an Indigenous
population]{.underline} (Bareli, 2001). Viewed as such, Zionism, then,
is inherently illegitimate. However, as such [critics are largely
informed by settler colonial theories]{.underline}, [a historically
contextualized response is required to separate fact from
fiction]{.underline} with "...neither moral judgmentalism nor
apologetics on behalf of Israeli interests" (Bareli, 2001, p. 103), or
presumably for that matter, Palestinian Arab interests. What then, is
"settler colonialism?" Greenstein provided a comprehensive definition,
which is instructive: 15 \[Settler colonialism\] identifies a cluster of
societies in which colonial rule -- the overseas extension of
Europe-based states -- was combined with large-scale immigration of
metropolitan settlers. Politically, it focuses on particularly resilient
forms of domination that serve the interests of settlers who made a new
home for themselves in overseas territories. Facing resistance from
indigenous people to their subjugation, settler societies were shaped
historically by ongoing conflict. This has provided them with common
features and a sense of shared destiny, based on the similar challenges
they faced. Solidarity between those at the losing end -- indigenous
groups, slaves and other people marginalized through this form of
colonial rule -- is the other part of the process. (Greenstein, 2017,
p. 1) Thus, one can see that [settler colonialism]{.underline} as a
phenomenon [is]{.underline} quite [malleable]{.underline}, and
applicable to many scenarios and can take on many forms (Greenstein,
2017). However, [the one thing that all cases of settler colonialism
have in common is]{.underline}, according to Greenstein, "[the
distinction between indigenous people and settlers]{.underline}
(including their descendants)" (p. 3). Greenstein argued that while
J[ews can certainly, to an extent, be viewed as Indigenous]{.underline}
to the territory, as "...if not as individuals then as a collective --
The Jewish People -- that [maintained unique identity and link to the
country over millennia]{.underline}, regardless of specific time and
space configurations" (Greenstein, 2017, p. 3). However, he seemingly
qualified Jewish indigeneity to those residing within Palestine prior to
Zionist (re)colonization. Speaking with regard to the consequences of
the 1948 Arab-Israeli War following partition, Greenstein wrote: It
involved the displacement of indigenous people by recently-arrived
settler immigrants: a vast majority of local Jews by 1948 had moved to
Palestine in the previous three decades, and new immigrants from Eastern
Europe and the Middle East doubled their numbers within the next four
years. In the other cases \[wars between equally indigenous parties to a
conflict\] those involved were equally indigenous to the scene as they
had co-existed in the same territory for centuries. (Greenstein, 2017,
p. 10) That is, Greenstein appeared to dismiss the notion that those
Jews who immigrated in the recent decades prior to the 1947 partition of
[Palestine could claim indigeneity to the land, and seems to privilege
Arab indigeneity by virtue of longstanding residence, while failing to
apply the same standard to those Arabs who recently migrated to
Palestine as well.]{.underline} Thus, **[for this critique to sustain
itself, it is essential for Jewish notions of indigeneity to be
dismissed]{.underline}** or 16 minimized, [insofar as an indeterminate
number of Jews in Palestine prior to partition had not lived among the
Arab population "for centuries."]{.underline} This perspective
privileges longstanding association with a land---as is undoubtedly the
case with many Palestinian Arabs---over the Jewish Indigenous
connection, **[without identifying a reason]{.underline}**, [nor a
threshold for these criteria.]{.underline} This therefore problematizes
Greenstein's approach, as [no time threshold is established to
constitute a "legitimate" length of time by which to claim
indigeneity]{.underline}, or have indigeneity extinguish. Moreover,
[this application of indigeneity is arbitrarily applied to only one set
of Jews within a specific set of criteria, while not applying to the
collective Jewish People]{.underline}, as per the commonly accepted
application of the concept elucidated via UNPFII. Other critiques focus
on different elements of the Zionist enterprise. According to Wolfe
(2006), both [settler colonialism and genocide are linked in a "logic of
elimination,"]{.underline} whereby genocide can be---but is not
necessarily---a component of settler colonial processes. In other words,
settler [colonialism seeks an "elimination" of sorts, but is not
invariably genocidal in its outcome]{.underline} (Wolfe, 2006). [The
primary motive of settler populations is to gain access to territory by
eliminating native societies, either physically, or culturally through
assimilation, and supplant it with a foreign society]{.underline}, a
process which can take many forms (Wolfe, 2006). Wolfe applied this
concept to Zionist colonization in Palestine, claiming that the process
of colonization involved efforts to disenfranchise not only Palestinian
Arab labour, but also to fashion an exclusively Jewish state, from
"...the negative process of excluding Palestine's Indigenous owners"
(Wolfe, 2006, p. 390[). Implicit, of course, is the suggestion that
Jews]{.underline}--- Zionist or not---[are not Indigenous to the
territory]{.underline}. Wolfe stated his contention bluntly, and applied
to Israel (even defined by pre-1967 borders) the same condition he
applied to all settler colonial societies that: \[...\] settler
colonialism is an inclusive, land-centred project that coordinates a
comprehensive range of agencies, from the metropolitan centre to the
frontier encampment, with a view of eliminating Indigenous societies.
Its operations are not dependent on the presence or absence of formal
state institutions or functionaries. (Wolfe, 2006, p. 393) 17 Yet in his
[conflation of Israel's founding with settler colonialism, Wolfe engaged
in emotive polemics describing Israel's "...chronic addiction to
territorial expansion]{.underline}" (Wolfe, 2006, p. 401) and
[implicitly denied Jewish indigeneity to the territory by suggesting
that the Zionist enterprise had driven "...so many of its original
inhabitants into the sand]{.underline}" (p. 401). Of importance here is
that aside from [a critique of particular Israeli policies---which may
or may not be legitimate---the denial of Jewish indigeneity is taken for
granted, which then paves the way for a simplistic and erroneous
equation between Zionism and settler colonialism.]{.underline} Lloyd
goes further by considering Zionism to be an "...exemplary settler
colonial project" (Lloyd, 2012, p. 59), arguing that [Zionism
necessitated---and continues to necessitate--- the "functional absence"
of "native people" in Palestine]{.underline} (p. 61), [effectively
downplaying Jewish indigeneity to the land, and privileging Palestinian
Arab indigeneity.]{.underline} Furthermore, Lloyd cited the existence of
Zionist Eurocentricism and desires among them to emulate European
nationstates, which will be addressed in more detail below, as evidence
of Zionist imperialism, and as a typical manifestation of settler
colonies around the world. Lloyd stated: Accordingly, the foundations of
Zionism are imbued with the contradictory pulls of European nationalisms
in general, between an inwardly directed demand for selfdetermination
and an outwardly directed desire for expansion through the colonisation
of others considered inferior to Europeans\...insisting on the
equivalence of the European Jews to other European nationalities and
therefore on the right to self-determination while at the same time
negotiating with the German Kaiser, British Colonial Secretary Joseph
Chamberlain, and the Ottoman Sultan in turn for a land to colonise,
embodies the terms that would come to shape Zionism through and through.
Zionism's conception of a nationality lay in the ethnic but largely
secular nationalisms of Europe. Like its nineteenth-century European
forebears, Zionist nationalism was founded in the belief in the
historical destiny of a given people to self-determination and
sovereignty. (Lloyd, 2012, pp. 63-64) Thus, Lloyd equated Zionism with
European settler colonialism by virtue of the existence of similar
worldviews between some Zionists and Western European nations.
Importantly, Lloyd suggested that Zionist settler colonialism is
characterized, as all settler colonialism is, on the appropriation of
Indigenous land, "\...rather than the political and economic
subordination of the 18 Indigenous population, the monopolisation of its
resources, or the control of its markets" (Lloyd, 2012, p. 66). However,
as Penslar (2001) lucidly illustrated, [this characterization requires
the obfuscation of the underlying motivations behind Zionism as an
Indigenous revival of the Jewish People in their historic homeland:
Zionism was a product of the age of imperialism; its adherents shared a
number of common sensibilities with European advocates of colonial
expansion in the Middle East. Yet the movement was not, in and of
itself, a form of colonial practice]{.underline}. Due to myriad
historical and ideological factors, Zionism sought to realize itself in
the Middle East, in an area chosen not for its strategic value, natural
resources or productive capabilities, but [solely because of the Jews'
historic, religious and cultural ties to the area known to them as the
Land of Israel.]{.underline} (Penslar, 2001, p. 96) As can be deduced,
many settler colonial models apply malleable criteria to accommodate a
critique of Zionism. Shimoni argued that postcolonialist theory is often
used as a tool through which to weaponize critique, by associating
anything with "colonialism"---rightly or wrongly, and often without
sufficient critical inquiry---to be beyond the pale (Shimoni, 2007).
Steinberg suggested that [such lenses utilize selective bias to
determine a priori "oppressors" and "oppressed" groups, and allow for
ideological positions to disproportionately value subjective
interpretations of events in order to produce notionally valid results
(]{.underline}Steinberg, 2007). Given our discussion of Jewish
indigeneity and its subsequent rejection by many Palestinian Arabs, as
well as a discussion of postcolonialist attempts to correlate Zionism
with settler colonialism, we turn to an elaboration of Zionism itself to
demonstrate the incongruence between the two concepts.

#### There is a clear difference between "settler colonialism" and "settlerism". "Settler colonialism" implies a foreign settler is "exploiting the land" -- distinct from the Jews who are coming back to their homeland.

DIO

Zionism Versus Settler Colonialism

First and foremost, Zionism was indeed (re)colonialist to the extent
that it was a movement of primarily---but not exclusively---Jews of
European extraction to Palestine. The intent was to settle the land and
encourage Jewish newcomers to compete for land and labor with both the
Palestinian Arab residents and Arab economic migrants beginning in the
1880s and continuing onward until the 1947 partition of Palestine (and
beyond) (Bareli, 2001). During this period, both Jews and Palestinian
Arabs competed for recognition with the British imperial 19 authorities,
in what amounted to a "civil war" between two separate nationalistic
communities (Bareli, 2001). [Unlike "settler societies" elsewhere, Jews
did not view themselves as foreign to the land, but as Indigenous
returnees seeking national independence]{.underline} (Troen, 2007). [For
this fundamental reason, Palestine was chosen over alternative
locations]{.underline} (Goff et al., 1998; Gans, 2007). While certainly
influenced by European thought, the Zionists invoked the cultural
distinctness of the Jewish People, a difference recognized by Europeans
historically through the "othering" and persecution of European Jews for
centuries (Bareli, 2001). Jews, according to Shimoni, were perceived as
the "\...quintessential Oriental Other" (Shimoni, 2007, p. 860) in the
myriad of societies they inhabited throughout history. Over time, they
had, to varying extents, internalized the ideals of their host
societies, engaged in self-hatred and the internalization of
stereotypes, and desired to mimic dominant cultural norms (Shimoni,
2007). Zionism was perceived by many of its adherents as the way to
assert a more confident identity and (re)construct the "New Jew" through
a re-association with the symbolism and connection of the land of Eretz
Yisrael/Palestine. [This particularly involved the pursuit of Jewish
resilience, and self-sufficiency for the Jews that were undoubtedly
influenced by European thought, but nevertheless distinct from European
nationalism]{.underline} (Shimoni, 2007). [For postcolonialist critiques
of Zionism---irrespective of its positive and negative
consequences---the matter of Jewish indigeneity to the land is denied,
ignored, or dismissed as irrelevant. Such critiques consign Zionism to a
political, historic, and socioeconomic vacuum, by conflating Zionist
(re)colonization with true cases of settler colonialism elsewhere,
thereby making Zionism appear as not only possessing a parasitic
quality, but also an arbitrary and predatory approach towards the
Palestinian Arabs. Such arguments disenfranchise Jews, while privileging
Palestinian Arabs, of their Indigenous patrimony, while ignoring the
"othering" that has also transpired on the side of Arab nationalists in
general, and Palestinian Arab nationalists, in particular.]{.underline}
Speaking to this trend in postcolonialist analysis of Zionism, Shimoni
asserted that, \[...\] [nothing is said of the degradations deriving
from the traditional dhimmi status of Jews as a tolerated but
subordinate and oft-humiliated religious minority]{.underline} within
the realm of Islam; not to speak of consequent self-righteous
indignation at any expressions of Jewish assertiveness, and the
pathological shame-and-honour syndrome which precludes any thought of
Jewish sovereignty within any part whatsoever of the claimed geo- 20
political realm of Islam. Moreover, as unquestionably sound scholarship
has shown, [Arab representations of Jews have increasingly projected
unmistakably anti-Semitic motifs,]{.underline} avidly adopted from
Christian Europe. (Shimoni, 2007, p. 863) However, as alluded to
elsewhere, this is not to suggest that Eurocentricism did not exist
among many Zionists. Many did in fact believe that their way of life was
superior to that of Palestine's Arab inhabitants, which was all but an
inescapable legacy of the European environment in which the early
Zionists found themselves (Bareli, 2001). However, there were those
Zionists who valorized---often romanticizing and idealizing---"the
Orient," causing intraZionist discord over what manifestation Zionism
should take on (Shimoni, 2007). Among such Zionists were those who
claimed that the Jews and Arabs were essentially distant family, with
some maintaining---albeit with scant evidence---that some Palestinian
Arabs were indeed descendants of ancient Hebrews, as a way to
demonstrate their fealty to the land and the region (Penslar, 2001).
David Ben-Gurion himself made this assertion, which had the de facto
effect of linking Jewish indigenity to any claims made by the
Palestinian Arab population, and vice versa (Pearl, 2008). Others viewed
the Palestinian Arabs as a corporate group (Muir, 2008) and called for
social integration with Palestinian Arabs, and for Jews to learn Arabic
in their schools (Karsh, 2008), all the while recognizing that the land
had enough room for both national groups (Gans, 2007). It would seem
then that among prominent Zionist thinkers---at least
rhetorically---there was no conflict in admitting that Jews were not
Palestine's sole Indigenous inheritors. According to Penslar, [Zionism's
mission civilisatrice was directed primarily at other Jews, with the aim
of having the Jewish People shed off the yoke of Europe and transform
themselves economically and politically through the (re)invention of an
Indigenous folk culture in their historic homeland. There was no
colonial attempt to force affiliation with Judaism or Zionist ideals
upon the Palestinian Arab population, unlike other European colonial
projects in North America, Africa, and Asia]{.underline} (Penslar,
2001). [The "New Jew" was to use Hebrew as a living national
language---a language always Indigenous to the region, most palpably in
Eretz Yisrael]{.underline}/Palestine (Bareli, 2001)---in direct
opposition to those who sought other languages as the Jewish lingua
franca (Troen, 2007). Importantly, [Zionists invested capital in, rather
than extracting resources from, Palestine for the benefit of a colonial
metropole, demonstrating that Jewish (re)colonization was not 21 carried
out for economic or merely "Eurocentric" purposes.]{.underline} In fact,
local economic conditions became attractive (for all) only following the
considerable influx of Jewish capital to Palestine from abroad (Bareli,
2001). Ultimately, however, the conflict was that of two competing
nationalisms. Both the Zionists and the Palestinian Arabs sought to
curry favour with the British imperial powers, and argue their
respective positions. The majority of mainstream Zionists indeed sought
to peacefully (to the extent possible) establish a Jewish majority in
Palestine, all while recognizing that there would always be---and
rightfully so---a permanent Arab minority within a Jewish State (Karsh,
2008). [Jewish indigeneity as a basis for Zionist aspirations did not
preclude the same rights for the Palestinian Arab population, despite
the reverse being true by a significant proportion of the Palestinian
Arab community]{.underline} (Shimoni, 2007). In this respect, we see at
the very least that the opposition to Zionism in Palestine was not over
its effect, but rather its intent. Moreover, today's [postcolonial
attempts at critiquing Zionism tend to critique both Zionism's intent
and effect, and demonstrating the congruence between Zionism and settler
colonialism, which is a far different exercise than what informed the
original reasoning by Palestinian Arabs themselves surrounding their
rejection of Zionism. A further characteristic of postcolonial discourse
on Zionism is the failure to contextualize Zionism within its historical
environment.]{.underline} The enterprise itself began in the late 19th
century within the Ottoman Empire, and continued under British imperial
rule following the Ottoman surrender. [In such a political environment,
Jews had limited authority over their own affairs, as imperial law
determined the limits of the Zionist enterprise in all spheres of life
(Penslar, 2001). Moreover, unlike in other imperial contexts, Jews were
not provided free lands and indentured labour in service of a foreign
imperial enterprise, but instead had to purchase land and hire labor
through their own means]{.underline} (Golan, 2001). However, as
reiterated elsewhere, investment in Palestine was the norm, rather than
the reverse, as Troen (2007) clearly illustrated: Jewish colonization
during its first forty years took place in the Ottoman Empire and was
not part of the process of imperial expansion in search of power and
markets. It was not a consequence of industrialization and financial
interests. Indeed, as numerous scholars have noted, Jewish settlement
was so unprofitable that it has been judged to be economically
irrational. (Troen, 2007, p. 881; italic emphasis added) 22 This meant
that Zionist (re)colonization of Palestine required the buttressing of
Jewish self-sufficiency in agriculture and commerce, to augment a unique
societal foundation for further growth. At times, although certainly not
always, this process resulted in exclusionary policies in relation to
Arab labor, whereby Arabs lost employment prospects as Zionists
encouraged and pressured Jewish employers to hire only Jewish employees
(Cohen, 2011). Yet the behavior was carried out to ensure Jewish
self-sufficiency without any imperial aegis (Shimoni, 2007). That is,
Zionism was meant to produce Jewish national continuity,
self-sufficiency, and independence within Eretz Yisrael/Palestine,
alone, with no loyalty to any other country. As Shimoni put it, "those
postcolonialist studies which ignore this intrinsic truth are guilty of
the\...privileging of consequences over intentions" (Shimoni, 2007, p.
866).

#### The alt is to reject the 1AC for using harmful discourse in the debate space. We advocate Israeli and Palestinian policies can be questioned without the term "settler colonialism".

[It is possible]{.underline}, however, [to conceive of Zionism as being
simultaneously an Indigenous project of Jewish national
reconstitution]{.underline} in Eretz Yisrael/Palestine and a settler
colonial enterprise, insofar as people point to the effect of Zionism
rather than its intent (as mentioned above). Through this perspective,
analysts could point out particular Israeli policies which are
detrimental to Palestinian national interests, rights, needs, and
desires. However, [such critiques would merit appropriate consideration
in the context of a critique of Israeli policies, along the lines of
critique levied against any other country---no more and no less. Zionism
itself could not be considered the fulcrum upon which any and all social
ills evident within the IsraeliPalestinian conflict hinge]{.underline}.
There are myriad reasons for the state of affairs that contemporarily
plague Israelis and Palestinians. Thus, [it is necessary to reiterate
that Jewish indigeneity and subsequent self-determination is not in
question, just as Palestinian national rights are not in question.
However, individual Israeli and Palestinian policies can certainly be
questioned, without drawing inaccurate parallels to settler colonialism,
or extinguishing the rights of any one group.]{.underline}

**Schenker**, David **08** \[Assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs, M.A., University of Michigan; Certificate, Center for
Arabic Study Abroad (CASA), American University in Cairo; B.A.,
University of Vermont\]. "Review of Arms Transfers to Israel: The
Strategic Logic behind American Military Assistance." Middle East Forum,
Middle East Forum, 2008, Summer,
www.meforum.org/1938/arms-transfers-to-israel.//AC

Rodman\'s study of U.S. arms transfers to Israel provides important
insight into this critical and oft-misunderstood element of the
strategic relationship. Relying on extensive U.S. archival research, the
book details the evolution of this relationship from Israel\'s early
reliance on Western European equipment through the start of U.S. arms
sales during the Johnson era to the end of the Reagan administration.

[Rodman\'s thesis is that **arms sales have provided Washington with
critical leverage over Israel**, enabling the United States to \"wring
concessions out of Israel in order to advance American national
interests,\" particularly during Middle East wars. For Israel\'s part,
according to Rodman, **weapons purchases from the United States
constitute an acceptable sacrifice of autonomy for
security**.]{.underline} The slender volume is a quick and absorbing
read and is full of well-footnoted examples illustrating the complicated
dynamics of U.S. and Israeli decision-making related to weapons sales.

The argument is convincing. Rodman points out that U.S. efforts to
influence other Israeli policies via this lever, such as its pursuit of
a nuclear weapons program, have proved decidedly less effective except
during Middle East wars, when, as Rodman argues, [U.S. influence on
Israeli policy has been dramatic. In 1967, **pressure from Washington
forced Israeli restraint in the face of Egyptian provocations**, such as
the closure of the Straits of Tiran. When the United States recognized
the futility of diplomacy, Rodman says, Washington gave the Jewish state
a tacit \"green light\" to embark on war. The same held true, Rodman
points out, during the 1969-70 War of Attrition when Israel was
compelled to stop its bombing raids against Egypt after Washington
threatened to withhold the military aid and diplomatic support necessary
for the raids to continue.]{.underline}

In perhaps the most striking example[, in **1973 U.S. pressure appears
to have dissuaded the government of Israel from taking preemptive
military action** against Syria and Egypt. \"Caught between the Israel
Defense Forces General Staff and the Nixon administration,\" Rodman
says, \"the Meir government chose to follow the position of Israel\'s
patron rather than the advice of its own military experts.\" After the
outbreak of hostilities, the Meir government accepted the Nixon
administration\'s cease-fire proposal because, Rodman writes, Israel had
no alternative but to \"**trade the postwar concessions desired by the
United States for continued American \[military\]
support.**\"]{.underline}

As Rodman deftly points out, Israel\'s conduct during the 1967-1973
period is \"not comprehensible unless it is examined in the context of
the American-Israeli patron-client relationship.\" Arms Transfers to
Israel provides a comprehensive picture of the origins and development
of the U.S.-Israeli military assistance relationship. In doing so,
although not intentionally, Rodman\'s study goes a long way toward
dispelling the now fashionable myth that the strategic relationship with
Israel is driven primarily by domestic U.S. politics.

\"US Military Aid to Israel -- from Another Perspective,\" Human Rights
Watch,
https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/11/14/us-military-aid-israel-another-perspective//ER

In the West Bank, [the Israeli military]{.underline} [[applies harsh
rules]{.underline}](http://www.militarycourtwatch.org/page.php?id=w8gxM9rINua108414AzlUTPyTHMr)
[to Palestinian children and tries them in military courts, which have a
[near-100
percent](http://www.haaretz.com/nearly-100-of-all-military-court-cases-in-west-bank-end-in-conviction-haaretz-learns-1.398369)
conviction rate. Settler children living in the same territory are
instead subject to Israel's civil laws and courts]{.underline}.

[With US funds providing 18.5 percent of [Israel's annual defense
budget](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf), **the US has the
leverage to change those practices**]{.underline}, if only it would use
it. [And there's no getting away from the risk that US military aid --
US\$127.4 billion over the decades -- may be underwriting unlawful
Israeli practices.]{.underline}

[If Israeli soldiers suspect a Palestinian child of throwing a rock at a
settler's car, they may, under the rules they apply, raid his home in
the middle of the night, drag him out of bed, and keep him awake for
hours for interrogation without allowing him to call a parent to say
where he is.]{.underline} Interrogators often pressure the child to sign
the record of his interrogation, written in Hebrew, which most
Palestinian children do not understand. And the rules permit security
officials to hold him [for up to four
days](http://www.militarycourtwatch.org/page.php?id=RyO5OsFMaZa27579A0cctVm0lxd)
without taking him before a judge.

[But if an Israeli child living in a West Bank settlement throws a rock
at a Palestinian car, he is legally protected from being interrogated at
night by Israeli police, and can have a parent present at the
interrogation.]{.underline} The police must notify Israel's Public
Defense Office of the arrest and cannot interrogate the child before the
office responds, unlike in the case of a Palestinian child. Israeli
authorities can hold him for at most 24 hours before taking him before a
judge.

[This discriminatory system is violently enforced. The [majority of
Palestinian
children](http://www.militarycourtwatch.org/files/server/BRIEFING%20PAPER%20-%20OCT%202017%20-%20FINAL.pdf)
arrested by Israeli forces say that they are subjected to
abuse]{.underline}, according to Military Court Watch, a rights group --
often blindfolded with their hands tied painfully, physically abused,
threatened, deprived of sleep, and strip searched. Children as young as
11 have described to me how Israeli police or soldiers [put them in
chokeholds](https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/07/19/israel-security-forces-abuse-palestinian-children),
and kicked, threatened, and left them outside for hours in cold weather.
Children said they urinated on themselves in fear during their arrest,
and had nightmares about their detention later.

Defense for Children International Palestine, a rights group,
interviewed 429 children detained between 2012 and 2015, and found that
three-quarters of them suffered physical violence. Two Israeli rights
groups, B'Tselem and HaMoked, [recently
concluded](http://www.btselem.org/publications/summaries/201710_unprotected)
that even in East Jerusalem, where Israeli laws rather than military
laws apply, ill-treatment is "the primary mode of conduct adopted by the
State of Israel for dealing with boys who are suspected of stone
throwing." Police subjected one boy to a 12-hour interrogation during
which they said they would not give him food or water or allow him to go
to the bathroom unless he confessed, the rights groups reported.

[**Nothing short of serious pressure is likely to end abuses** that a
[2013 UNICEF
report](https://www.unicef.org/oPt/UNICEF_oPt_Children_in_Israeli_Military_Detention_Observations_and_Recommendations_-_6_March_2013.pdf)
found to be "widespread, systematic and institutionalized]{.underline}."
Israel [half-heartedly
implemented](https://www.unicef.org/oPt/UNICEF_oPt_Children_in_Military_Detention_Bulletin_No_1_October_2013.pdf)
a few reforms, like a "pilot" program in 2014 of [issuing
summonses](http://www.militarycourtwatch.org/page.php?id=cVS0aT7YTza668553A8V0ouP9Z8o)
instead of terrifying [nighttime
arrests](http://www.militarycourtwatch.org/print.php?id=dlhWkhy63ea478353A0EwbP7jl94).
But Israel limited the program to two West Bank areas and [repeatedly
suspended
it](http://www.militarycourtwatch.org/files/server/Translation%20Parliamentary%20Letter%20January%2015%202015%20-%20Palestinian%20Child%20Rights%20-%20Dutch%20MFA.pdf),

Most summonses were delivered to children [during night raids by armed
forces](https://972mag.com/idf-suspends-plan-to-minimize-nighttime-arrests-of-children/102205/)
-- causing the same fear that the program was supposed to avoid.

#### Pretty decent conditions card about the Palestinian children 

Peter **Beinart**, **5-20**-2019, a Senior Columnist at The Forward and
Professor of Journalism and Political Science at the City University of
New York. \"It's Time to End America's Blank Check Military Aid to
Israel,\" Forward,
https://forward.com/opinion/424591/its-time-to-end-americas-blank-check-military-aid-to-israel//ER

Last month, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declared that
American aid
to [Israel](https://forward.com/culture/qa/427138/israel-everything-you-need-to-know/) is
"something that can be discussed" in Washington. Her comments made news
precisely because [America's policy of giving Israel billions in aid
without expecting any policy changes in return hasn't actually been
discussed --- or at least questioned --- in either party in more than a
quarter-century. That needs to change.]{.underline}

To understand why, ask yourself this question: Why did Israelis last
month re-elect a prime minister who [opposes a Palestinian
state](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Netanyahu-A-Palestinian-state-wont-be-created-586017)
and --- by
[championing](https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/04/08/netanyahu-i-will-not-remove-a-single-israeli-settler-from-judea-and-samaria/)
settlement growth and [vowing to
annex](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/world/middleeast/netanyahu-annex-west-bank.html)
parts of the West Bank --- is working to make one impossible?

There are several common answers. One is historical: Over the last two
decades the second intifada and rocket fire from the Gaza Strip have
created an enduring right-wing majority among
[Israeli](https://forward.com/fast-forward/424538/most-democrats-like-israel-but-not-netanyahu-poll/)
Jews. A second answer is demographic: Netanyahu's center-left rivals
lean heavily on the votes of secular Ashkenazi Jews, whose share of the
Israeli population is shrinking. Netanyahu [relies
more](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/17/the-ultra-orthodox-will-determine-israels-political-future-haredi-likud-netanyahu-shas-deri-utj/)
on Orthodox Jews, whose share is rising.

There's truth to both these explanations. But there's a third, which
American politicians and pundits rarely acknowledge:
[[Israelis](https://forward.com/fast-forward/424506/israel-terror-attacks/)
re-elected [Netanyahu](https://forward.com/tag/benjamin-netanyahu/)
because he showed them he could undermine the two-state solution with
international impunity]{.underline}. Indeed, he made that accomplishment
a central theme of his campaign.

Again and again in recent years, Netanyahu has mocked political rivals
who warned that his policies toward the Palestinians were making
[Israel](https://forward.com/fast-forward/424422/israel-kan-hamas-eurovision-webcast-hack/)
a global pariah. In a speech to supporters in 2017 he quoted former
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who predicted in 2011 that, "Israel's
delegitimization is on the horizon." To which Netanyahu
[responded](https://972mag.com/the-diplomatic-tsunami-that-never-came/129278/),
"Nonsense... Israel is enjoying an unparalleled diplomatic spring."

In a campaign [ad](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=771289586562769)
this year, Netanyahu juxtaposed an ominous 2013 quote from former
foreign minister Tzipi Livni --- "The prime minister of Israel is
leading the State of Israel to severe isolation" --- with images of him
alongside Donald Trump and other world leaders. In another
[ad](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/world/netanyahu-releases-campaign-ad-showing-him-lecturing-obama/2019/03/28/b7807954-75eb-49d2-969d-1acd8fcca08c_video.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.80354167c26d),
he showed himself in the Oval Office telling a dejected-looking Barack
Obama that
[Israel](https://forward.com/fast-forward/424504/williams-college-israel-student-group/)
will never return to the 1967 lines.

Netanyahu's message, as Hagai El-Ad of the Israeli human rights group
B'Tselem has
[noted](https://972mag.com/the-diplomatic-tsunami-that-never-came/129278/),
was that Israel can have it all: [It can deny Palestinians basic rights
and enjoy international favor at the same time. Even presidents like
Obama, who disapprove of Israel's actions, don't penalize Israel for
them. They fold.]{.underline}

Netanyahu was right. It['s not just Trump who has enabled his assault on
the two-state solution. Obama did too. For eight years as president,
Obama warned that Israeli policies in the West Bank were endangering
Palestinian rights, American interests and Israel's future as a
democratic and Jewish state.]{.underline}

And yet[, during those eight years, Obama never used American aid to
Israel as a lever to change the policies he decried.]{.underline} Obama
watched Netanyahu rebuff him again and again. He watched as Netanyahu in
2011 travelled to the White House to publicly repudiate his vision of a
Palestinian state near the 1967 lines.

He watched as Netanyahu in 2014 ["flatly
refused"](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-the-peace-talks-secret-fruits-1.5254436)
to give Secretary of State John Kerry "[the slightest hint about the
scale of the territorial
concessions](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-the-peace-talks-secret-fruits-1.5254436)"
he was willing to make to the Palestinians. [He watched as Netanyahu
used settlement growth to
"[sabotage](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4515821,00.html),"
in the words of one American official, Kerry's efforts at brokering a
two-state deal.]{.underline}

[Then, after all that]{.underline} --- and after Netanyahu's fervent
lobbying against the [Iran](https://forward.com/tag/iran/) nuclear
agreement --- [Obama in 2016 rewarded him with the largest military aid
package in Israeli history.]{.underline}

"[America is a thing you can move very
easily](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/checkpoint-washington/2010/07/netanyahu_america_is_a_thing_y.html),"
Netanyahu once boasted to settlers. Obama and Trump have both
illustrated the point.

The American government's capitulation --- under both Democrats and
Republicans --- is the unspoken elephant in the room when Americans
discuss Israel's embrace of permanent occupation. [It is impossible to
understand the looming death of the two-state solution without
understanding that, for more than a twenty-five years, no American
president has made Israel pay a price for undermining it.]{.underline}
During that time, the notion that an American president might refuse to
subsidize policies that brutalize Palestinians, harm America's image,
and threaten Israeli democracy, has become almost inconceivable. It's
time for a new generation of American progressives --- especially
progressive Jews --- to make it conceivable again.

One reason conditioning aid has become inconceivable is that any
American president who proposed it would be labeled anti-Israel, if not
anti-Semitic. But by that standard, these epithets should be affixed to
most of the presidents of the mid to late twentieth century.

During the cold war, as Nathan Thrall details in his indispensable book,
[The Only Language They
Understand](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KFWXADG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&tag=thefor03-20),
presidents we now routinely think of as pro-Israel routinely used
American aid to influence Israeli policy.

When Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, after attacking Egypt
alongside Britain and France in 1956, mused about annexing Egyptian
territory, Dwight Eisenhower threatened to end all US aid unless Israeli
troops withdrew immediately.

In 1975, when Israel refused Henry Kissinger's demand for a partial
withdrawal from the Sinai desert, which it had conquered in 1967, Gerald
Ford vowed a
"[reassessment](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Arab-Israeli-Conflict-Americas-Monograph/dp/0226769623?tag=thefor03-20)"
of "our relations with Israel," and refused any new military or economic
assistance until the withdrawal was done.

When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1977, Jimmy Carter told Menachem Begin
that Israel's use of American armored personnel carriers violated the
[Arms Export Control
Act](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&sys_id=b9a933addb7c930044f9ff621f961932),
which prevented American weaponry from being used for offensive
operations. Unless Israel left Lebanon immediately, Carter warned,
future arms sales "will have to be terminated."

In 1982, when the Reagan administration
[determined](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL30982.pdf) that Israel's
use of cluster bombs in Lebanon may have violated America's Mutual
Defense Assistance Agreement with the Jewish state, Reagan banned new
sales of the bombs to Israel for six years. In 1991, George H.W. Bush
[initially
refused](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/18/world/bush-rejects-israel-loan-guarantees.html)
to give Israel the \$10 billion in loan guarantees it requested to
resettle Soviet immigrants until it froze settlement growth in the West
Bank.

This history not only undercuts the claim that conditioning American aid
reflects hostility to Israel, it also undercuts the claim that
conditioning aid doesn't work. In recent years, former diplomats like
[Dennis
Ross](https://www.amazon.com/Doomed-Succeed-U-S-Israel-Relationship-Truman/dp/0374536449?tag=thefor03-20),
and establishment American Jewish leaders like [Malcolm
Hoenlein](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-searches-for-middle-east-peace/2012/07/14/gJQAQQiKlW_story.html?utm_term=.49fab39d1523),
have insisted that only American reassurance, not American pressure,
produces Israeli concessions.

[But during the cold war, **American pressure produced Israeli
concessions again and again**. When Eisenhower threatened American aid
in 1956, Israeli troops began leaving Egypt within 36 hours. Ford's
threat to halt new arms sales forced a partial Israeli withdrawal from
the Sinai in 1975 and Carter's threat forced Israel's withdrawal from
Lebanon in 1977.]{.underline} The following year, Carter again
threatened aid during the Camp David talks that led to Israel leaving
the Sinai completely. And although Bush failed to restrain settlement
growth, his initial refusal to provide loan guarantees, according to the
[Oxford
historian](https://www.amazon.com/Iron-Wall-Israel-Norton-Paperback/dp/0393321126?tag=thefor03-20)
Avi Shlaim, "forced" Israel to participate in the 1991 Madrid
Conference, where [for the first
time](https://adst.org/2015/10/the-1991-madrid-peace-conference/) it
publicly negotiated with a delegation of Palestinians.

Of course, American pressure was rarely the sole reason for Israel's
actions. Had Egyptian President Anwar Sadat not offered peace, it's
unlikely Israel would have fully left the Sinai. Had Palestinians not
launched the first intifada, which raised the price of Israel's
occupation, and had the PLO not recognized Israel's existence, it's
unlikely Israel would have signed the 1993 Oslo Accords. Had Saudi
Arabia not unveiled the Arab Peace Initiative in 2002, Ariel Sharon may
not have withdrawn Israeli settlers from Gaza in a bid to
[undercut](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20202970?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
the Saudi effort three years later.

Palestinian and Arab behavior matters. And it matters who leads Israel.
But Israelis are more likely to elect rejectionists to lead them --- and
rejectionists are more likely to remain rejectionists once in office ---
when they know their rejectionism will not harm Israel's most important
alliance.

Netanyahu's decade-long political dominance in Israel, and his
decade-long defiance in Washington, would simply not have been possible
under the old rules. Which is why progressives need to bring back those
old rules --- or at least a modified version of them --- if they truly
want Israel to change course.

[To condition American aid on Israeli behavior would not single Israel
out. In theory, the [Foreign Assistance
Act](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43361.pdf), as amended in the late
1990s, prohibits the United States from providing aid or training to any
foreign military units that have committed "gross violations of
internationally recognized human rights."]{.underline}

[Congress also places [additional human rights
conditions](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hjres31/BILLS-116hjres31enr.pdf)
on American aid to numerous specific governments]{.underline}, including
Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Columbia, El Salvador, Egypt, Guatemala,
Haiti, Honduras, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. [Before Trump ended American
assistance to the Palestinian Authority, its
[aid](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22967.pdf) was among the most
heavily conditioned of all.]{.underline}

What distinguishes American aid to Israel is precisely its exemption
from the rules and limitations that govern assistance to other nations.
While the United States [phased
out](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf)economic assistance to
the Jewish state a decade ago, Israel receives far more military aid
than any country where the United States is not currently at war.
Outside of active American combat zones like Afghanistan, Iraq and
[Syria](https://forward.com/tag/syria/), the United States gives most of
its military aid through something called Foreign Military Financing: a
line of credit through which governments can buy American weapons. In
Trump's 2019 budget request, [61
percent](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) of that foreign
military financing goes to Israel. Israel also receives its financing in
a more advantageous way than other countries. Every other foreign
government receives a set amount of money per year, which it can spend
on American weapons. Seth Binder of the Project on Middle East Democracy
compares it to a debit card: You can only spend what America has already
given you. Israel, by contrast, enjoys something called "cash-flow
financing." Binder compares it to a credit card: Israel can buy American
weapons merely by committing to spend money America will give it in the
future. Under the Memorandum of Understanding Obama announced in 2016,
Israel is due to receive \$3.8 billion per year until 2028. And because
of cash-flow financing Israel can spend some of that future money now.
That helps it buy expensive items --- as it did in 2017 when it
purchased [17 F-35 fighters at close to \$100 million per
plane](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-finalizes-agreements-to-buy-17-more-f-35-jets/)
--- which would be hard to afford using America's aid for only one
particular year.

The United States also gives Israel its aid right away. While most other
nations can access American aid only when they agree upon an arms
purchase, Israel is given a lump sum at the beginning of every fiscal
year. Since Israel doesn't spend all that money right away, it puts the
rest in the bank, where it accrues interest, which makes the amount it
actually receives in American aid even higher than the official \$3.8
billion figure.

Finally, Israel is the only nation that can spend part of its aid buying
weapons from its own manufacturers, not those in the United States. In
that way, Israel has used American assistance to fund its defense
industry, which now ranks as the [8th
largest](https://www.statista.com/chart/17316/share-of-global-arms-exports-by-country/)arms
exporter in the world. The ten-year deal Obama signed in 2016 phases out
this "offshore procurement" in 2028. Israel, however, is still allowed
to spend [at least 20 percent of its
aid](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) on Israeli weaponry
through 2024, and smaller percentages after that: A total of [more than
\$5.6
billion](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3123877-2016-September-14-US-Israel-MOU.html).

But even observers who acknowledge that i[t's not inherently anti-Israel
to condition American aid, and that such conditionality has proven
effective at changing Israeli behavior in the past]{.underline}, might
still resist doing so for one simple and understandable reason:
Security. Israel faces genuine threats, both from hostile governments
like Iran and violent groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah.
American aid helps protect Israel from them.

Americans should care about keeping Israelis safe. That means continuing
to give Israel the roughly \$500 million per year the US currently
provides for missile defense and guaranteeing Israel's military edge
over its regional foes. But [there are ways to condition aid that don't
weaken Israeli security. They actually enhance it.]{.underline}

What follows does not exhaust the possibilities. In the years to come,
[Democrats should consider a range of proposals that balance their
commitment to Israeli security with their commitment to Palestinian
rights. But it's worth detailing two types of conditionality in
particular. The first involves specific Israeli practices that the
United States should refuse to fund because they serve no legitimate
security goal and produce immense suffering.]{.underline}

[One such practice is the detention of Palestinian children. In the West
Bank, Israel maintains two legal systems: a civil system that guarantees
robust legal protections to its Jewish citizens and a military system
that guarantees far fewer rights to its Palestinian
non-citizens]{.underline}. Under this system of military law, the
Israeli army routinely arrests Palestinian children.

Between 2012 and 2015, [Defense of Children International-Palestine
[interviewed](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/dcipalestine/pages/1527/attachments/original/1460665378/DCIP_NWTTAC_Report_Final_April_2016.pdf?1460665378)
more than 400 Palestinian children]{.underline} --- a[lmost one-third of
them under the age of 16 --- that Israel had arrested in the West Bank.
It found that many were arrested in the middle of the night. Most were
blindfolded, strip-searched and had their hands bound. In the vast
majority of cases, neither they nor their parents were told why they
were being arrested.]{.underline}

A majority reported being physically abused during their arrests and a
quarter reported physical abuse while being interrogated in detention.
While in detention --- which can last from 24 to 96 hours, depending on
a child's age --- almost all were interrogated in the absence of their
parents or a lawyer. [Which helps explain why the UN Children's Fund
(UNICEF) has
[reported](https://www.unicef.org/oPt/UNICEF_oPt_Children_in_Israeli_Military_Detention_Observations_and_Recommendations_-_6_March_2013.pdf)

call Gaza "the world's largest open-air prison." [In a form of
collective punishment, Israel refuses to abandon its blockade over Gaza
as long it is ruled by a terrorist government intent on destroying its
state. While Hamas [deliberately

Israel continues to accept many civilian deaths as [collateral

194 Palestinians have been killed and 29,000 wounded since the beginning
of the 2018 Gaza Border Protests.

Still, the United States and its allies have refused to criticize
Israel's use of excessive military violence. Israel, which gets more
U.S. foreign aid than [any other
country](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33222.html), has
requested a record-high [\$3.8

its clout with its Arab allies to facilitate Israel's regional

process.]{.underline}

[Building trust with the Palestinians will be difficult but essential
for any negotiations]{.underline}. The Trump administration's funding
cut for the United Nations' Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA and its
announcement of the embassy move to Jerusalem has added insult to injury
of decades of pro-Israeli bias. The United States should support
courageous groups of Palestinian peace activists while calling out
the [dangerous

### \--Israel Says Yes 

#### Israel caves to leverage---Trump has political capital with them

[Philip H. **Gordon**](https://www.cfr.org/expert/philip-h-gordon),
2-28-**2019**, Mary and David Boies Senior Fellow in U.S. Foreign
Policy, \"Rethinking U.S. Policy Toward the Palestinians,\" Council on
Foreign Relations,
https://www.cfr.org/report/rethinking-us-policy-toward-palestinians//ER

To avoid such dire outcomes, the Trump administration should rethink its
current course. It should forego introducing a comprehensive peace plan
that, under current circumstances, has almost no chance of success and
instead take steps toward improving conditions on the ground and
preserving prospects for more ambitious agreements. These steps include
restoring previous levels of financial assistance for refugees and
humanitarian projects in the West Bank and Gaza[, using U.S. leverage
with Israel to improve daily life and freedom of movement for
Palestinians, including by constraining settlement expansion, committing
to the goal of a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem to
balance the move of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv, amending recent
congressional legislation---the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act
([ATCA](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2946/text))---with
a waiver so that assistance to the PA can be preserved, and taking steps
to improve Palestinian economic growth.]{.underline}

Trump's Counterproductive New Approach

For most of his first year in office, Trump avoided initiatives that
could upset prospects for peace and maintained a serious dialogue with
the Palestinian leadership. But this generally balanced approach changed
dramatically in December 2017 with the U.S. decision to recognize
Jerusalem as Israel's capital and to move the U.S. embassy
there---without getting anything from Israel in return. Trump argued
that this unilateral move---one that was opposed by 128 countries in the
United Nations---took the issue of Jerusalem "[off the
table](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-trump-netanyahu-meet-in-davos-1.5766434)."
In fact, it placed the issue front and center as an obstacle to
agreement not just for Palestinians but for the Arab leaders Trump had
been counting on to support the plan. After Trump announced the move,
Palestinian leaders broke off contacts with Trump officials; those
contacts have yet to resume.

The Trump administration's next major step was to cut [financial
assistance](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22967.pdf) to the
Palestinians. In August 2018, the administration announced plans to
eliminate all fiscal year (FY) 2017 assistance to the West Bank and
Gaza, amounting to some \$231 million. The targets included U.S.-funded
projects---such as schools, hospitals, and water and sewage projects
that serve thousands of Palestinians---many of which will now be
[abandoned](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/17/685932903/palestinian-school-and-sewage-projects-unfinished-as-u-s-cuts-final-bit-of-aid).
The administration also cut \$10 million in funding for [reconciliation
programs](https://www.usaid.gov/west-bank-and-gaza/fact-sheets/conflict-management-and-mitigation-program)
that bring together individuals of different ethnic, religious, and
political backgrounds from areas of conflict. As a result, the U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID) has suspended projects in
the West Bank and Gaza, and plans to lay off local staff.

The refugee issue cannot simply be defined away.

A month later, the administration announced it would reprogram all U.S.
humanitarian contributions previously allocated to UNRWA, which provides
support to some five million Palestinian refugees and their descendants.
As the world's leading donor to UNRWA, the United States had been
providing around \$359 million (roughly 25 percent of the agency's
overall 2017 budget). The Trump administration maintains that this move
will save money and force other countries to pay the bills and that
denying assistance to the descendants of refugees will undermine their
political claims. But the refugee issue cannot simply be defined away,
and long-term substitute funding has, unsurprisingly, proven difficult
to secure: UNRWA now needs more than \$1 billion to maintain 2018 levels
of assistance, a situation its director calls "[the most severe
financial
challenge](https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-launches-2019-emergency-appeals-and-budget-requirement-totaling-us-12)"
in the agency's history.

The administration has also been shutting down mechanisms for dialogue
and cooperation with Palestinians. In September 2018, Trump announced he
was closing the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in DC. He
followed that move by announcing the closure of the U.S. consulate in
Jerusalem---which has for decades been the conduit for U.S.-Palestinian
relations---placing its functions under the authority of the U.S.
ambassador to Israel. Justified by the administration in terms of
improving
"[efficiency](https://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2018/10/286731.htm),"
in reality the move means treating Palestinians of the West Bank
bureaucratically and symbolically as part of a [greater
Israel](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/10/24/merging-the-us-consulate-and-embassy-in-jerusalem-shows-us-is-no-longer-truly-pursuing-a-two-state-solution/)
and reinforcing the Israeli perspective in diplomatic reporting to
Washington.

In October 2018, Trump signed ATCA, a law that subjects all recipients
of nonmilitary financial assistance to potential lawsuits by U.S.
citizens; it went into effect on February 1, 2019. While many members of
Congress supported ATCA with good intentions, the law had the
[consequence](https://www.lawfareblog.com/shedding-light-anti-terrorism-clarification-act-2018)
of forcing the Palestinian Authority to reject all remaining U.S.
assistance to avoid billions of dollars in potential legal liabilities.
The result---an end to all U.S. security assistance to the PA---has left
even [Israeli security
officials](https://www.axios.com/government-shutdown-threatens-derail-israeli-palestine-security-a4327e68-6e8b-46ef-ace8-aeb2d69ef7b2.html)
deeply concerned. The position of U.S. security coordinator, a
three-star U.S. general who since 2005 has overseen the training of
Palestinian security forces for critical counter-terrorism and
counter-narcotics work, will assume a cooperation-only mission.

According to the Trump administration, these moves are designed to make
clear to Palestinians that they need to accept new realities and agree
to the U.S. peace plan. As the president's top advisor on the issue,
Jared Kushner,
[explains](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/world/middleeast/kushner-palestinians-israel.html),
"All we're doing is dealing with things as we see them and not being
scared out of doing the right thing. I think, as a result, you have a
much higher chance of actually achieving a real peace." Kushner has
[also
said](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/world/middleeast/jared-kushner-interview-transcript.html)
that he believes the Palestinian leadership is refusing talks with the
United States about the peace plan because "they are scared we will
release our peace plan and that the Palestinian people will actually
like it," apparently
[assuming](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/kushner-israeli-palestinian-peace-plan/563606/)
that the Palestinian people are more ready for compromise with Israel
than their leadership. Trump has himself been even blunter about using
U.S. humanitarian aid as leverage,
[telling](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5342645,00.html)
the Palestinians publicly that "we're not paying until you make a deal.
If you don't make a deal we're not paying."

Instead of compelling Palestinians to accept a deal, the new measures
are having the opposite effect.

Instead of compelling Palestinians to accept a deal, however, the new
measures are having the opposite effect. With the end of U.S. assistance
and with U.S. alignment with Israeli positions on crucial political
issues, Palestinian leaders have cut off political contact with Trump
officials. Two-thirds of Palestinians now
[oppose](http://www.pcpsr.org/sites/default/files/poll%2067%20full%20text_March2018_%20English.pdf)
the resumption of contact with U.S. negotiators and 88 percent view the
United States as biased toward Israel. The clearest product of the
administration's approach has not been Palestinians bowing to U.S.
demands but seeking---and to a degree gaining---support for greater
international recognition of Palestinian statehood and for diplomatic
and economic pressure on Israel.

Policy Recommendations

The Trump administration's new approach toward the Palestinians does not
well serve the interests of the United States or the people of the
region. A better course of action would include the following steps:

Put off the announcement of a plan for comprehensive peace until
prospects for success are more propitious. Under current circumstances,
there is little chance that peace negotiations will get started and
virtually no chance such talks would succeed. The majority of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's current cabinet does not even
support a two-state solution and PA President Mahmoud Abbas is too weak
and unpopular to sell an agreement even if he agreed to one. Under these
conditions, if past is prologue, the most likely result of a U.S. peace
initiative will be immediate Palestinian rejection, followed by
qualified Israeli support, which would only further poison the
atmosphere between Palestinians on the one hand and Israelis and
Americans on the other. The outcome of the April 9 Israeli elections
could or could not provide an opening, but launching a comprehensive
peace plan before both sides are ready to negotiate seriously with each
other would do more harm than good.

Worsened conditions could lead to civil unrest.

Restore financial assistance, including to UNRWA, to pre-FY2017 levels.
There is little sign that cuts in U.S. assistance to the Palestinians
will force them to the negotiating table and every sign that the cuts
will have serious humanitarian
[consequences](https://www.npr.org/2019/01/31/689742245/opinion-heres-why-u-s-aid-to-palestinians-needs-to-continue).
Aid organizations
[assess](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=23B6F77C-F583-42C7-A8A7-48320D139CE1)
the cuts will affect critical services: emergency food aid, health care
for anemia and malnutrition, access to clean water, rehabilitation
services for cerebral palsy, and breast cancer treatment. Worsened
conditions could lead to civil unrest and drive increasing numbers of
Palestinians toward groups and individuals that advocate for violence to
achieve their political aims.

Announce the U.S. policy goal of a Palestinian state with a capital in
East Jerusalem. U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel
was consistent with long-standing U.S. ambitions and, in many ways,
simply recognized a practical reality. And the Trump administration
constructively made clear that Jerusalem's borders and issues of
sovereignty would still be up for negotiation. Still, by taking Israel's
side on such a sensitive issue and not even recognizing the Palestinian
aspiration to statehood with a Palestinian capital in Jerusalem, the
administration deeply alienated not just Palestinians but Arab leaders,
who have
[reiterated](https://www.axios.com/israel-saudi-arabia-relations-trump-peace-plan-a1a906b6-0c01-4f9b-b833-74f850181297.html)
they will only support Trump's plan or normalize relations with Israel
if this issue is addressed. The administration could mitigate the damage
of its unilateral move by announcing that the creation of a Palestinian
state with a capital in East Jerusalem is also a U.S. policy goal.

Amend the Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act to permit assistance to
Palestinians. The Trump administration should ask Congress to amend this
law to allow the restoration of assistance to Palestinians---at a
minimum for PA security forces. Failure to do so will severely undermine
the PA's ability to fight terrorism and drug trafficking on the West
Bank, ironically making more likely the very types of attacks the act is
designed to deter.

[Use U.S. leverage with the new Israeli government to curb settlement
expansion, close illegal outposts, improve Palestinian freedom of
movement, and prevent annexation of territory. **Trump has built up
significant political capital with Israel** by supporting Israeli
positions on core issues such as Jerusalem and refugees and by taking a
tough approach to Iran. President Trump should use some of that capital
to apply diplomatic pressure on the Israeli government to improve the
quality of Palestinian daily life, including by curbing settlement
activity.]{.underline} Such pressure could come in the form of
willingness to criticize Israel publicly in international bodies and to
support enhanced Palestinian representation in such bodies. [If the
issue of settlements is not addressed, over the long run, it will
further undermine Israeli democracy and the prospects for Trump's
"ultimate deal."]{.underline}

#### **Israel will comply** 

**Arad 18
(**<https://besacenter.org/perspectives-papers/arms-export-policy-israel/>)

Within the context of its security dialogue with the US, Israel must
relay its strong opposition to the release of the F-35 fifth-generation
fighter jet to the Arab states. Israel must retain its regional
exclusivity of this platform since its regional aerial superiority
depends, to a large degree, on the technological advantages that the
F-35 fighter affords it. In addition, [areas of cooperation in arms
exports need to be earnestly explored with regard to those systems for
which Israeli-US collaboration provides mutual benefits in securing arms
deals.]{.underline} Air defense systems seem to be the prime candidate
for this kind of partnership. At the same time, rules of competition
need to be established with regard to the other arms export endeavors
that will be contested between the US and Israel. Finally, [Israel
should be wary of relaxing standards and procedures for approving arms
exports. A more competitive global arms market is no excuse for the
reversal of human rights, corruption, and security restrictions on arms
sales.]{.underline}

[Palestinian and Arab behavior matters. And it matters who leads Israel.
But Israelis are more likely to elect rejectionists to lead them --- and
rejectionists are more likely to remain rejectionists once in office ---
when they know their rejectionism will not harm Israel's most important
alliance.]{.underline}

Netanyahu's decade-long political dominance in Israel, and his
decade-long defiance in Washington, would simply not have been possible
under the old rules. Which is why progressives need to bring back those
old rules --- or at least a modified version of them --- if they truly
want Israel to change course.

[To condition American aid on Israeli behavior would not single Israel
out. In theory, the [Foreign Assistance
Act](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43361.pdf), as amended in the late
1990s, prohibits the United States from providing aid or training to any
foreign military units that have committed "gross violations of
internationally recognized human rights."]{.underline}

Congress also places [additional human rights
conditions](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hjres31/BILLS-116hjres31enr.pdf) on
American aid to numerous specific governments, including Afghanistan,
Burma, Cambodia, Columbia, El Salvador, Egypt, Guatemala, Haiti,
Honduras, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Before Trump ended American assistance
to the Palestinian Authority,
its [aid](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22967.pdf) was among the
most heavily conditioned of all.

[What distinguishes American aid to Israel is precisely its exemption
from the rules and limitations that govern assistance to other nations.
While the United States [phased
out](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) economic assistance to
the Jewish state a decade ago, Israel receives far more military aid
than any country where the United States is not currently at
war]{.underline}. Outside of active American combat zones like
Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, the United States gives most of its
military aid through something called Foreign Military Financing: a line
of credit through which governments can buy American weapons. [In
Trump's 2019 budget request, [61
percent](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) of that foreign
military financing goes to Israel. Israel also receives its financing in
a more advantageous way than other countries. Every other foreign
government receives a set amount of money per year, which it can spend
on American weapons. Seth Binder of the Project on Middle East Democracy
compares it to a debit card: You can only spend what America has already
given you. Israel, by contrast, enjoys something called "cash-flow
financing." Binder compares it to a credit card: Israel can buy American
weapons merely by committing to spend money America will give it in the
future]{.underline}. Under the Memorandum of Understanding Obama
announced in 2016, Israel is due to receive \$3.8 billion per year until
2028. And because of cash-flow financing Israel can spend some of that
future money now. [That helps it buy expensive items --- as it did in
2017 when it purchased [17 F-35 fighters at close to \$100 million per
plane](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-finalizes-agreements-to-buy-17-more-f-35-jets/) ---
which would be hard to afford using America's aid for only one
particular year.]{.underline}

[The United States also gives Israel its aid right away. While most
other nations can access American aid only when they agree upon an arms
purchase, Israel is given a lump sum at the beginning of every fiscal
year. Since Israel doesn't spend all that money right away, it puts the
rest in the bank, where it accrues interest, which makes the amount it
actually receives in American aid even higher than the official \$3.8
billion figure.]{.underline}

Finally, [Israel is the only nation that can spend part of its aid
buying weapons from its own manufacturers, not those in the United
States. In that way, Israel has used American assistance to fund its
defense industry]{.underline}, which now ranks as the [8th
largest](https://www.statista.com/chart/17316/share-of-global-arms-exports-by-country/)arms
exporter in the world. The ten-year deal Obama signed in 2016 phases out
this "offshore procurement" in 2028. Israel, however, is still allowed
to spend [at least 20 percent of its
aid](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) on Israeli weaponry
through 2024, and smaller percentages after that: A total of [more than
\$5.6
billion](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3123877-2016-September-14-US-Israel-MOU.html).

[But even observers who acknowledge that it's not inherently anti-Israel
to condition American aid, and that such conditionality has proven
effective at changing Israeli behavior in the past, might still resist
doing so for one simple and understandable reason: Security. Israel
faces genuine threats, both from hostile governments like Iran and
violent groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah. American aid
helps protect Israel from them.]{.underline}

Americans should care about keeping Israelis safe. That means continuing
to give Israel the roughly \$500 million per year the US currently
provides for missile defense and guaranteeing Israel's military edge
over its regional foes. But there are ways to condition aid that don't
weaken Israeli security. They actually enhance it.

[What follows does not exhaust the possibilities. In the years to come,
Democrats should consider a range of proposals that balance their
commitment to Israeli security with their commitment to Palestinian
rights. But it's worth detailing two types of conditionality in
particular. The first involves specific Israeli practices that the
United States should refuse to fund because they serve no legitimate
security goal and produce immense suffering]{.underline}.

#### the unparalleled support for Israel in other regions of foreign policy gives the U.S. leverage to stop extrajudicial killings

Alex **Kane**, 5-12-20**17**(Alex Kane is a New York-based freelance

\"Inside Sources Say the State Dept Refuses To Trace Whether Israel Is
Using U.S. Military Aid Illegally,\"In These
Times, <http://inthesetimes.com/features/israel-palestine-killings-us-aid-military-weapons.html>)//ellalaur

[Israel's army has long deployed U.S. weapons to kill Palestinian
civilians.]{.underline}

An In These Times survey of detailed reports published by the United
Nations, Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch and
Amnesty International reveals that, since 2009, at least 272
Palestinians appear to have been killed by U.S.-made weapons used by
Israeli forces.

Fourteen of these killings occurred during law enforcement situations
(outside of an active war zone), such as during demonstrations. Some of
these incidents have been captured on video. In [one video from
2016](https://www.btselem.org/video/20160324_soldier_executes_palestinian_attacker_in_hebron),
for example, an Israeli soldier, armed with a U.S.-made M4 assault
rifle, executed an injured Palestinian who was lying still on a Hebron
street after he stabbed a soldier.

The full death toll of Palestinians killed by U.S. weapons is likely far
higher, since many reports are not able to identify the weapon used.

It's not supposed to be this way. [U]{.underline}.[S. arms exports to
Israel (and other countries) are governed by laws placing restrictions
on sales to nations that abuse human rights. Campaigns to cut U.S.
military aid to Israel have latched onto a particular measure, known as
the Leahy Law]{.underline}. [The law prohibits U.S. assistance or
training from flowing to foreign military units that have committed a
gross violation of human rights, unless the foreign government has held
that unit accountable.]{.underline}

But interviews with human rights advocates, congressional aides and
former and current U.S. officials reveal that enforcement of the Leahy
Law in Israel is lax, with no tracking of which army units receive U.S.
weapons.

[Human rights advocates say they have brought the State Department
evidence of specific crimes committed by soldiers who clearly used U.S.
weapons, only to have that evidence brushed off. A current U.S.
official, who asked for anonymity because they are not authorized to
speak to the press and could be fired as a result,]{.underline} told In
These Times that they are not aware of any time when an Israeli unit was
cut off from U.S. assistance under the Leahy Law.

This lack of enforcement allows Israel to get away with extrajudicial
executions of Palestinians, human rights advocates say.

[Maria LaHood, deputy legal director at the [Center for Constitutional
Rights](https://ccrjustice.org/), says the United States' "unparalleled
support for Israel" gives it leverage to end these extrajudicial
killings if it chooses. "Our government does not lack the legal tools to
put an end to Israel's human rights violations," she says. "It lacks the
political will."]{.underline}

"The Only Language They Understand: Forcing Compromise in Israel and
Palestine." New York: Metropolitan Books, 2017)//ellalaur

"Between Begin's 1977 proposal and the signing of the Camp David
Accords, Carter faced numerous setbacks. To overcome them, he put
tremendous strain on Israel. In February 1978, he colluded with Sadat on
a nine-step plan to force an agreement on Begin. The following month, he
told Begin sternly that the main "obstacle to peace, to a peace treaty
with Egypt, is Israel's determination to keep political control over the
West Bank and Gaza, not just now, but to perpetuate it even after five
years." Dayan wrote, "Though Carter spoke in a dull monotone, there was
fury in his cold blue eyes, and his glance was dagger sharp." Begin
admitted to his aides that the meeting was one of the most difficult
moments of his life. Two days later, Carter told a group of Senate
leaders, "We cannot support Israel's policy which is incompatible with
the search for peace." He then pushed through an arms "ale to the Saudis
over vehement objections from Israel and its supporters in Congress.
When Vice President Mondale visited Israel in July 1978, Ariel Sharon
accused the administration of "sowing the seeds for war by
over-pressuring Israel and over-promising the Arabs."43 At Camp David
itself, Carter squeezed the parties by putting forward his own
proposals, warning Sadat of the end of their personal friendship and the
relationship between their two countries, and threatening Begin with
American censure and the termination of US aid.44 Israel's former deputy
national security adviser Charles Freilich wrote in his book on the
country's decision-making:

On the tenth day \[of the thirteen-day Camp David summit\] Carter
threatened to state publicly that whereas he had reached full
understanding with Sadat, Begin's refusal to dismantle the Sinai
settlements and recognize the applicability of Resolution 242 to the
West Bank had prevented agreement. American pressure came to a head on
the twelfth and penultimate day, as [Carter threatened direct sanctions:
"I will not be able to turn to Congress and say, 'Continue providing
Israel "with assistance,' when I am not sure that you really want
peace]{.underline}." It was at that meeting that Begin finally conceded
on the settlements and Palestinian clauses. He would later tell the
Knesset: "there was the possibility of saying no to President Carter and
the Camp David summit would have blown up that very day.... I knew that
Israel would not be able to withstand it ... not in the U.S., not in
Europe, not before the Jews of the United States.... Israel could not
have stood ... facing the entire world."45

[But most of the concessions in the Camp David Accords had been made by
mid-December 1977, only six months after Begin took office the previous
June.]{.underline} [They were unprecedented for any Israeli government,
and particularly striking for one so hawkish and wholly committed to
Greater Israel]{.underline}. Begin consented to a full withdrawal from
Sinai although his foreign minister had often said that he preferred
keeping the territory to having peace. Begin was the first Israeli prime
minister to agree even to the presence of Palestinians in official
negotiations over the future of the West Bank and Gaza, and he was
harshly attacked for it by the centrist Labor Party.

"Begin had gone from ruling out any possibility of ever negotiating with
the PLO to accepting its members in negotiations. From insisting that
Palestine was Jordan, he came around to proposing the establishment of
Palestinian self-governance in Gaza and the West Bank.46

To many Palestinians, Begin's concessions were mere crumbs. [But they
were **enormous compromises** in the minds not just of the Likud but of
the Israeli center and left. When implemented under Oslo, they changed
the conflict irrevocably and brought about, for the first time since
1967, seemingly irreversible steps toward Palestinian
self-determination.]{.underline}

In fairly short order, [Jimmy Carter succeeded in forcing one of the
most right-wing, annexationist figures in Israel's history to do
precisely what he had most sought to avoid: plant the seed of a
Palestinian state.]{.underline}

II\. Israeli Withdrawals

Zionism will not evacuate a single yard of land without a
political-military struggle that compels it to do so."---GEORGE HABASH

In the decades since the Camp David Accords, every American president
has tried to finish what Jimmy Carter started. Each has failed, and
these failures have led to a widespread conclusion, not just in the
United States but throughout the world, that the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict may be insoluble. The parties are intransigent, the issues are
intractable, the interests of political leaders are too narrow, and on
each side the power of constituencies opposed to partition is too great.
Palestinian leaders are paralyzed by their lack of legitimacy. Israeli
governments are constrained by fractious coalition politics. American
presidents are shackled by the power of Israel's domestic supporters.
Arab states are divided and distracted by more urgent concerns. The role
of religion, dueling claims to sovereignty over sacred spaces, large
refugee populations, demands for restitution too great to be satisfied,
the smallness of the territory, Israel's vulnerability to surprise
attack, the trauma of the Holocaust, the freshness of wounds from
terrible violence, the absence of trust, and the irreconcilability of
conflicting historical narratives---all, it would seem, render the
conflict too difficult to resolve."

"Yet Carter's experience suggests a different view. Faced with the
threat of real losses---whether human, economic, or political---Israelis
and Palestinians have made dramatic concessions to avert them. Through
persistent coercion, both have taken steps toward accepting an
international consensus around Palestine's partition into two states
along the pre-1967 lines. Carter's achievement is but one of many
examples demonstrating each party's responsiveness to force, that is, to
all forms of pressure---including violence---that threaten significant
costs.

In Israel's case, each of its territorial withdrawals was carried out
under duress. Following the 1956 Suez Crisis, when Israel colluded with
France and the United Kingdom to invade Egypt, Prime Minister David
Ben-Gurion refused to withdraw from Sinai and Gaza. At the end of the
war, he wrote that the Red Sea island of Tiran, off the coast of Sinai,
would now be "part of the third kingdom of Israel," and in his victory
speech he hinted at annexing Egyptian territory. International
intimidation of Israel brought about a swift and complete reversal. The
Soviet premier sent a letter threatening rocket attacks and the
deployment of volunteer forces to assist the Egyptian army. President
[Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration issued an ultimatum: if Israel
didn't unconditionally withdraw]{.underline}, it [would lose all aid
from the United States and from American Jews, and the US would not
oppose Israel's expulsion from the UN.48 Within a day and a half of his
victory speech, Ben-Gurion announced Israel's withdrawal.]{.underline}

[Israel's next retreats came on the heels of the devastating October
1973 war, which alerted the country to the necessity of peace with Egypt
and the effectiveness of Egyptian and Syrian forces.]{.underline} The
war had shaken Israel, at one point causing a teary-eyed Moshe Dayan to
predict the "destruction of the third temple."49 [In the wake of the
conflict, Israel signed three agreements to undertake limited
withdrawals, one in Syria and two in Sinai. Each was made under acute
pressure by the United States, which had been subjected to a painful
Arab oil embargo in response to its support for Israel.]{.underline}

In its first Sinai withdrawal agreement, negotiated during a war of
attrition with Egypt, Israel made greater concessions than those it had
refused to make previously, which was among the reasons the Egyptians
called the 1973 war a victory. Stalled talks on the second Sinai
withdrawal were successfully concluded thanks only to a US threat in the
form of a "reassessment" of relations with Israel---the prime minister
called it "[one of the worst periods in American-Israeli
relations"---during which the United States suspended consideration of
economic assistance and refused to provide any new arms deals. The
agreement to withdraw from parts of Syria in 1974 was, like the first
Sinai disengagement, completed under the strain of an ongoing war of
attrition, with Syrian forces striking Israeli territory and IDF
positions."]{.underline}

#### Ensuing one sided negotiation solves for both- attracts participation of the opposed antagonist

[Intended to spur two-sided negotiations toward a diplomatic objective,
GFB responds to mediation problems and strengthens the mediator's
leverage in two ways. It reflects: (1) the search for leverage to spur
negotiating movement; and (2) the fundamental conflict between the
primary antagonists' interests, which hampers the search for a mutually
acceptable negotiating formula]{.underline}. We discuss these in turn.

Mediation leverage is usually understood in relation to antagonists who
ex- perience mutual pain and heavy costs in an MHS condition, and
thereby are attracted to unilateral action to relieve themselves of
those pressures (Zartman 2000). The mediator seeks to forestall such
action. "\[T\]he mediator may even need to reinforce a stalemate," write
Touval and Zartman (1985: 11), "using its own resources to add negative
arguments and inducements to keep the parties from trying to resolve the
situation unilaterally." But Israel and the Palestinian Authority are
not subject to MHS13 (Maundi 2006: 162).

[In the absence of MHS, an independent-minded American mediator can use
GFB to push negotiation movement]{.underline}. We have already noted how
the me- diator can use her country's relationship between the
antagonists, and dip- lomatic crises, to promote conflict with and
between the antagonists to gain such movement. [A third source of
mediation leverage for movement is dimin- ished asymmetry of
Israeli-Palestinian capabilities. Currently, Israel's superior
capability in relation to the Palestinian Authority makes it difficult
for the US to oppose Israeli officials who reject negotiations and
promote a so-called "one state" solution of a Palestinian entity under
Israeli authority. American rec- ognition of Palestine adds to
Palestine's negotiating leverage, making the an- tagonists more equal in
strength. A fourth source of leverage comes from the possibility of
negotiating with a more receptive antagonist separately. If one opponent
decides not to participate, ensuing one-sided negotiations can still
enhance the security positions of both antagonists. And initiating, or
threaten- ing to initiate, separate negotiations may attract the
participation of an antag- onist that is opposed to negotiations, but
decides to participate in a settlement rather than remain outside
it.]{.underline}

American mediation techniques must also be adapted to conflicting
Israeli- Palestinian interests. [The biggest shortcoming in American
mediation on Palestine is not the search for shared perceptions or
definition of their conflict; neither seems attainable (Raiffa 1982:
215--216). Without shared perceptions, there can also be no transition
toward an agreed upon goal (Zartman 1988). The practical negotiating
problem is that the antagonists understand Israeli- Palestinian
relations very differently and cannot reconcile those understand-
ings.]{.underline} [The Israeli government and settlers envision a
Palestine deferential and subordinate to Israeli authority, while
Palestinian leaders aim for self-determi- nation, with a Palestinian
state functioning as an equal to Isr]{.underline}ael. Under these
circumstances, moving the antagonists beyond their current deadlock
makes it desirable to build elements of an agreement inductively,
irrespective of how those elements are interrelated (Zartman & Berman
1982: 89ff).

#### Getting concessions on Israel requires capitalizing on leaders' weakness- value of alliance

Barry H. **Steiner** 20**18**( Steiner :A.B., University of Southern
California (International Relations), 1963; Ph.D., Columbia University
(Political Science), 1970.His research and teaching specialty areas

[Israeli leaders in each case parried demands by the US for compromise,
and their opposition required interminable American
counter-effort]{.underline}. Shamir was asked to make mostly symbolic
accommodation. Begin was asked to concede authoritative governmental
functions to the Palestinians, going beyond the de- mand for autonomy.
Netanyahu was pressured to give up territory controlled by Israel to the
Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu's concessions were neutralized when his
government fell, while Begin, whose government was weakened by his
concessions on the Sinai, made no concessions on Palestinian governance.

[A second case commonality was the special American relationship with
Israel, which, along with American attention to the Israeli objections,
impaired American ability to push new and innovative mediation steps.
The cases sug- gest that protecting this relationship had higher
American priority than peace- making over Palestine.]{.underline} It
provided a safety net that absorbed frictions between the two countries
which emerged over peacemaking. Yet [while it encouraged a strain on
peacemaking agreement, it also appeared to license strong disagree-
ment, and the assumption by Israeli officials, whose security interests
in the negotiations were stronger than that of the Americans, that, in
Miller's words (2008: 274), "they could push America around and get away
with it."1]{.underline}8

What can be said about the difference between Madrid, when the US con-
fronted the Israelis, and Wye and Camp David I, when it did not? In the
for- mer, the tougher American approach seemed to coincide with a
decline in Israeli resistance to pressure. American demands to Israel to
recognize PLO- sympathetic Palestinians then caused a split in the
Israeli national unity gov- ernment, the Labor contingent being willing
to break up the Cabinet for the sake of moving ahead on peacemaking. And
Shamir, divided earlier from his own party by his resistance to holding
a conference, became more accommo- dating when he faced the prospect of
isolation within Israel over his opposi- tion to negotiations.

The American non-confrontational approach to Camp David I and Wye eased
the Israeli negotiation problem by suggesting the US wanted to avoid a
negotiation breakdown. Non-confrontational American officials would not
intend -- as Baker had done earlier with Shamir -- to weaken Begin and
Netanyahu at home and/or capitalize on splits within the Israeli
Cabinet. A confrontational American approach advocated within the
American govern- ment in those cases would have necessitated
capitalizing upon Begin and Netanyahu's domestic weaknesses (Friedman
1994).

[For confrontation-minded American officials, our cases distinguish
three ways to capitalize upon Israeli leader weaknesses. One approach,
reflected in the background to the Madrid Conference, would accentuate
differences on the peacemaking front within Israel by encouraging
establishment of a na- tional unity government in which a peace faction
would have considerable prominence. The second confrontational approach,
contemplated by some of Carter's advisors, would condition the
American-Israeli alliance upon Israel cooperation on Palestine. It would
be based on the American assumption that Israel values the alliance more
than it opposes comprehensive peace. A third approach, postponing
confrontation, is suggested by Carter's Camp David I decision not to
pressure Begin to make concessions to the Palestinians. Confronting
Israel directly was then merely an option that the US ultimately decided
not to pursue.]{.underline}

#### Pressure works\-- U.S. relations are too important to Israel 

Stephen M. **Walt**, 1-26-**2009**, professor of international relations
at Harvard University. \"Can the United States put pressure on Israel?:
A user\'s guide,\" Foreign Policy,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/04/10/can-the-united-states-put-pressure-on-israel-a-users-guide//ER

[But what about pressure on Israel? The United States has only rarely
put (mild) pressure on Israel in recent decades (and never for very
long), even when the Israeli government was engaged in actions (such as
building settlements) that the U.S. government opposed.]{.underline} The
question is: if the Netanyahu/Lieberman government remains intransigent,
what should Obama do? Are there usable sources of leverage that the
United States could employ to nudge Israel away from the vision of
"Greater Israel" and towards a genuine two-state solution? Here are a
few ideas.

1\. [**Cut the aid package?** If you add it all up, Israel gets over \$3
billion in U.S. economic and military aid each year, which works out to
about \$500 per Israeli citizen. **There's a lot of potential leverage
here,**]{.underline} but it's probably not the best stick to use, at
least not at first. Trying to trim or cut the aid package will trigger
an open and undoubtedly ugly confrontation in Congress (where the
influence of AIPAC and other hard-line groups in the Israel lobby is
greatest). So that's not where I'd start. Instead, I'd consider a few
other options, such as:

2\. Change the Rhetoric. The Obama administration could begin by using
different language to describe certain Israeli policies. While
reaffirming America's commitment to Israel's existence as a
Jewish-majority state, it could stop referring to settlement
construction as "unhelpful," a word that makes U.S. diplomats sound
timid and mealy-mouthed. Instead, we could start describing the
settlements as "illegal" or as "violations of international law." The UN
Charter forbids acquisition of territory by force and the Fourth Geneva
Convention bars states from transfering their populations (even if
voluntarily) to areas under belligerent occupation. This is why earlier
U.S. administrations described the settlements as illegal, and why the
rest of the world has long regarded them in the same way. U.S. officials
could even describe Israel's occupation as "contrary to democracy,"
"unwise," "cruel," or "unjust." Altering the rhetoric would send a clear
signal to the Israeli government and its citizens that their
government's opposition to a two-state solution was jeopardizing the
special relationship. 3. Support a U.N. Resolution Condemning the
Occupation. Since 1972, the United States has
[vetoed](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/usvetoes.html)
forty-three U.N. Security Council resolutions that were critical of
Israel (a number greater than the sum of all vetoes cast by the other
permanent members). If the Obama administration wanted to send a clear
signal that it was unhappy with Israel's actions, it could sponsor a
resolution condemning the occupation and calling for a two-state
solution. Taking an active role in drafting such a measure would also
ensure that it said exactly what we wanted, and avoided criticisms that
we didn't want included. 4. Downgrade existing arrangements for
"strategic cooperation." There are now a number of institutionalized
arrangements for security cooperation between the Pentagon and the
Israel Defense Forces and between U.S. and Israeli intelligence. The
Obama administration could postpone or suspend some of these meetings,
or start sending lower-grade representatives to them. There is in fact a
precedent for this step: after negotiating the original agreements for a
"strategic partnership," the Reagan administration suspended them
following Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Today, such a step would
surely get the attention of Israel's security establishment. 5. Reduce
U.S. purchases of Israeli military equipment. In addition to providing
Israel with military assistance (some of which is then used to purchase
U.S. arms), the Pentagon also buys [millions of
dollars](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3469677,00.html) of
weaponry and other services from Israel's own defense industry. Obama
could instruct Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to slow or decrease
these purchases, which would send an unmistakable signal that it was no
longer "business-as-usual." Given the battering Israel's economy has
taken in the current global recession, this step would get noticed too.
6. Get tough with private organizations that support settlement
activity. As David Ignatius [recently
noted](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/25/AR2009032502800.html)
in the Washington Post, many private donations to charitable
organizations operating in Israel are tax-deductible in the United
States, including private donations that support settlement activity.
This makes no sense: it means the American taxpayer is indirectly
subsidizing activities that are contrary to stated U.S. policy and that
actually threaten Israel's long-term future. Just as the United States
has gone after charitable contributions flowing to terrorist
organizations, the U.S. Treasury could crack down on charitable
organizations (including those of some prominent Christian Zionists)
that are supporting these illegal activities.

7\. Place more limits on U.S. loan guarantees. The United States has
provided billions of dollars of loan guarantees to Israel on several
occasions, which enabled Israel to borrow money from commercial banks at
lower interest rates. Back in 1992, the first Bush administration held
up nearly \$10 billion in guarantees until Israel agreed to halt
settlement construction and attend the Madrid peace conference, and the
dispute helped undermine the hard-line Likud government of Yitzhak
Shamir and bring Yitzhak Rabin to power, which in turn made the historic
Oslo Agreement possible.

8\. Encourage other U.S. allies to use their influence too. In the past,
the United States has often pressed other states to upgrade their own
ties with Israel. If pressure is needed, however, the United States
could try a different tack. For example, we could quietly encourage the
EU not to upgrade its relations with Israel until it had agreed to end
the occupation.

I don't think Obama needs to employ all of these steps --and certainly
not all at once --- but t[he United States clearly has plenty of options
if pressure turns out to be necessary.]{.underline} And most of these
measures could be implemented by the Executive Branch alone, thereby
outflanking die-hard defenders of the special relationship in Congress.
Indeed, even hinting that it was thinking about some of these measures
would probably get Netanyahu to start reconsidering his position.

Most importantly, Obama and his aides will need to reach out to Israel's
supporters in the United States, and make it clear to them that pressing
Israel to end the occupation is essential for Israel's long-term
survival. He will have to work with the more far-sighted elements in the
pro-Israel community --- including groups like J Street, the Israel
Policy Forum, Brit Tzedek v'Shalom, and others --- and make it perfectly
clear that his administration is not selling Israel down the river. And
yes, we are also going to have to keep pressing Hamas to moderate its
positions and push the Palestinian authority to create more effective
governing institutions.

[The key point to grasp is that using U.S. leverage on both sides--and
not just one--is not an "anti-Israel" policy, if that is what it will
take to make the two-state solution a reality]{.underline}. It is in
fact the best thing we could do for ourselves and for Israel itself. In
effect, [the United States would be giving Israel a choice: it can end
its self-defeating occupation of Palestinian lands, actively work for a
two-state solution, and thereby remain a cherished American ally. Or it
can continue to expand the occupation and face a progressive loss of
American support as well as the costly and corrupting burden of ruling
millions of Palestinians by force.]{.underline}

Indeed, that is why many---though of course not all--Israelis would
probably welcome a more active and evenhanded U.S. role. It was former
Prime Minister Ehud Olmert [who
said](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/929439.html) "if the two-state
solution collapses, Israel will face a South-Africa style struggle for
political rights." And once that happens, he warned, "the state of
Israel is finished." The editor of Ha'aretz, David Landau, conveyed much
the same sentiment last September when he
[told](http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c41_a1531/News/Short_Takes.html)
former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the United States should
"rape" Israel in order to force a solution. Landau's phrase was shocking
and offensive, but it underscored the sense of urgency felt within some
segments of the Israeli body politic.

[Indeed**, I suspect it would not take much U.S. pressure to produce the
necessary shift in Israel's attitudes**. As the recent [bipartisan
statement](http://www.usmep.us/bipartisan_recommendations/A_Last_Chance_for_a_Two-State_Israel-Palestine_Agreement.pdf)
notes, "most Israelis understand and appreciate that, at the end of the
day, what really matters most for Israel's security is a relationship of
trust, confidence, and friendship with the U.S." If the United States
believes that a two-state solution is the best option, then it will have
to convey that this "trust, confidence, and friendship" can be retained
if Israel changes course, but cannot be taken for granted.]{.underline}

#### U.S. has leverage---Defense offsets

Muscle: Using Financial Leverage for Middle East Peace,\" Foreign Policy

[As negotiations on Israeli settlements commence in this environment of
uncertainty,]{.underline} the Obama administration will need all the
bargaining chips it can marshal. [The key is to find a form of leverage
that is costly enough to impact Israeli behavior without threatening
their security and is also relatively cheap for the administration to
apply.]{.underline} [**Defense "offsets**" --- incentives granted by
private companies to facilitate the purchase of military goods ---
**satisfy all these conditions, and may be especially effective in the
struggle for Middle East peace.**]{.underline}

Like most industrialized nations, U.S. defense manufacturers routinely
grant offsets to purchasing governments, usually in the form of
agreements to co-produce specific weapons or invest in commercial
enterprises. It has long been U.S. practice not to allow offsets on
products and services purchased with U.S. military assistance funds ---
except when it comes to Egypt and Israel. [The billions of dollars in
additional defense assistance that Israel has secured through this
legislative loophole may prove to be a significant source of leverage in
the Middle East peace process.]{.underline}

#### Leverage works---allows Netanyahu to reverse policy

Yousef **Munayyer**, 4-19-**2009**, is a policy analyst with the
American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington, \"Leverage
U.S. military aid to halt Israeli settlements,\"
https://www.inquirer.com/philly/opinion/currents/20090419_Leverage_U_S\_\_military_aid_to_halt_Israeli_settlements.html//ER

[These facts run contrary to stated U.S. policy toward the peace
process, but the new government of Israel and the residents of Ariel and
other settlements who voted for Likud do not seem to care.]{.underline}

[Every American administration since Jimmy Carter\'s has taken a
position against settlements in the West Bank**.** They are not only
illegal under international law, but they also jeopardize Israel\'s
long-term security, stability, and prospects for peace with its
neighbors.]{.underline}

Settlements and the security structures that surround them debilitate
the livelihoods of Palestinians, cut them off from each other, and make
a viable Palestinian state unachievable. From 1994 to 2004, after the
start of the Oslo peace process, which was based on the principle of two
states, the settler population grew a striking 89 percent.

On a recent trip to the region, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton criticized settlement construction and the demolition of
Palestinian homes in Jerusalem. Yet expansion plans continue to be
developed by the Israeli Civil Administration.

[Clearly, words have yet to alter the course of Israeli policies, and if
the past is prologue, a Netanyahu-led government will not be helpful in
ending construction. In fact, the last time Netanyahu was prime
minister, settlement construction increased to its highest levels in 20
years.]{.underline}

When it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we are running out of
time to save a two-state solution. Waiting for \"pro-peace\" governments
to be elected on both sides is like waiting for the planets to align.
[With the right wing on the rise in Israel and a fragmented Palestinian
polity, the ideal configuration seems light-years away. Israel is on a
crash course with an irreversible entanglement in Palestinian
territory.]{.underline}

It\'s time for a new approach that will make it clear to the Israeli
government that there must be a permanent freeze on settlement
construction and expansion.

In 2007, the United States and Israel signed a memorandum of
understanding guaranteeing Israel \$30 billion in military assistance
over the next decade. This assistance, however, has never been
conditioned or leveraged to ensure compliance with U.S. policy on
settlements.

By conditioning assistance on compliance with a complete and permanent
freeze on settlement construction, the United States can send a clear
message to Israel.

[This message could also help Netanyahu. Since the domestic constituency
that put him into power is sympathetic to settlement expansion,
**limitations on U.S. assistance can give Netanyahu the ability to argue
that his hands are tied and that a settlement freeze is
necessary.**]{.underline}

If we are shipping our tax dollars overseas in these tough economic
times, the least we should do is make sure they are being used to
further U.S. objectives. If the United States truly is a friend to
Israel, it should show some tough love, and conditioning aid is the
right way to start.

Despite what many Americans think, [Israel is not, strictly speaking,
our ally]{.underline}. (Alliances are defined by mutuality among
nations, and no one would expect Israel to come to our defense if we
were attacked by a third party.) [Israel is our client, and we are its
patron to the tune of more than \$3 billion a year in aid]{.underline}.
In return for that support, Israel gives us access to intelligence
gleaned from its many agents and assets in the Greater Middle East.
[That support also gives us considerable leverage over Israeli actions,
but only if we use it. More than any previous president, Trump has opted
not to use it --- to give Netanyahu a green light to do pretty much
anything he wants]{.underline}. And Netanyahu is taking full advantage
of the opportunity. Fully aware that his American counterpart may well
have less than two years left in office, the Israeli prime minister
appears to understand the need to move quickly.

#### U.S. FMF provides leverage---Israeli leaders hands are tied 

Will **Blesch**,, 5-14-**2019**, writer for Israeli national news,
\"Should Israel do without US financial aid?,\" Israel National News,
http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/23867//ER

[According to a 2018 U.S. Congressional Report on U.S. foreign aid to
Israel, "Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign
assistance since World War II]{.underline}. To date, the United States
has provided Israel \$134.7billion (current, or noninflation-adjusted,
dollars) in bilateral assistance and missile defense funding. [Almost
all U.S. bilateral aid to Israel is in the form of military assistance,
although in the past Israel also received significant economic
assistance."]{.underline} (2) [The most recent bout of funding includes
the following: · \$3.1 billion in Foreign Military Financing, of which
\$815.3 million is for off-shore procurement;]{.underline} · [\$705.8
million for joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense projects,including \$92
million for Iron Dome, \$221.5 million for David\'s Sling, \$310 million
for Arrow 3, and \$82.3 million for Arrow 2; · \$47.5 million for the
U.S.-Israeli anti-tunnel cooperation program; · \$7.5 million in
Migration and Refugee Assistance; · \$4 million for the establishment of
a U.S.-Israel Center of Excellence in energy and water technologies; ·
\$2 million for the Israel-U.S. Binational Research & Development
Foundation (BIRD) Energy program; and · The reauthorization of War
Reserves Stock Allies-Israel (WRSA-I) program through fiscal year
2019.]{.underline} "For FY2019, the Trump Administration is requesting
\$3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing for Israel and \$500 million
in missile defense aid to mark the first year of the new MOU. The
Administration also is seeking \$5.5 million in Migration and Refugee
Assistance (MRA) funding for humanitarian migrants to Israel." (2) [This
clearly shows a frightening dependence on America in order to maintain a
"qualitative military edge**." It also provides the United States with
leverage.**]{.underline} What was it Shakespeare said? "Neither a
borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend" [As

influence on internal matters of security**. As long as

that are solely good for our own nation.]{.underline}

#### **Leverage key to solve Israeli abuses**

**Beinart 19** (<https://fmep.org/resource/11095/>)

Last month, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez declared that
American aid to Israel is "something that can be discussed" in
Washington. Her comments made news precisely because [America's policy
of giving Israel billions in aid without expecting any policy changes in
return hasn't actually been discussed --- or at least questioned --- in
either party in more than a quarter-century. That needs to
change.]{.underline} To understand why, ask yourself this question: Why
did Israelis last month re-elect a prime minister who [opposes a
Palestinian
state](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Netanyahu-A-Palestinian-state-wont-be-created-586017)
and --- by
[championing](https://www.israelhayom.com/2019/04/08/netanyahu-i-will-not-remove-a-single-israeli-settler-from-judea-and-samaria/)
settlement growth and [vowing to
annex](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/world/middleeast/netanyahu-annex-west-bank.html)
parts of the West Bank --- is working to make one impossible? There are
several common answers. One is historical: Over the last two decades the
second intifada and rocket fire from the Gaza Strip have created an
enduring right-wing majority among
[Israeli](https://forward.com/fast-forward/424538/most-democrats-like-israel-but-not-netanyahu-poll/)
Jews. A second answer is demographic: Netanyahu's center-left rivals
lean heavily on the votes of secular Ashkenazi Jews, whose share of the
Israeli population is shrinking. Netanyahu [relies
more](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/17/the-ultra-orthodox-will-determine-israels-political-future-haredi-likud-netanyahu-shas-deri-utj/)
on Orthodox Jews, whose share is rising. There's truth to both these
explanations. But there's a third, which American politicians and
pundits rarely acknowledge:
[Israelis](https://forward.com/fast-forward/424506/israel-terror-attacks/)
re-elected Netanyahu because he showed them he could undermine the
two-state solution with international impunity. Indeed, he made that
accomplishment a central theme of his campaign. Again and again in
recent years, Netanyahu has mocked political rivals who warned that his
policies toward the Palestinians were making
[Israel](https://forward.com/fast-forward/424422/israel-kan-hamas-eurovision-webcast-hack/)
a global pariah. In a speech to supporters in 2017 he quoted former
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who predicted in 2011 that, "Israel's
delegitimization is on the horizon." To which Netanyahu
[responded](https://972mag.com/the-diplomatic-tsunami-that-never-came/129278/),
"Nonsense... Israel is enjoying an unparalleled diplomatic spring." In a
campaign [ad](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=771289586562769) this
year, Netanyahu juxtaposed an ominous 2013 quote from former foreign
minister Tzipi Livni --- "The prime minister of Israel is leading the
State of Israel to severe isolation" --- with images of him alongside
Donald Trump and other world leaders. In another
[ad](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/world/netanyahu-releases-campaign-ad-showing-him-lecturing-obama/2019/03/28/b7807954-75eb-49d2-969d-1acd8fcca08c_video.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.80354167c26d),
he showed himself in the Oval Office telling a dejected-looking Barack
Obama that
[Israel](https://forward.com/fast-forward/424504/williams-college-israel-student-group/)
will never return to the 1967 lines. Netanyahu's message, as Hagai El-Ad
of the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem has
[noted](https://972mag.com/the-diplomatic-tsunami-that-never-came/129278/),
was that Israel can have it all: It can deny Palestinians basic rights
and enjoy international favor at the same time. Even presidents like
Obama, who disapprove of Israel's actions, don't penalize Israel for
them. They fold. Netanyahu was right. It's not just Trump who has
enabled his assault on the two-state solution. Obama did too. For eight
years as president, Obama warned that Israeli policies in the West Bank
were endangering Palestinian rights, American interests and Israel's
future as a democratic and Jewish state. And yet, during those eight
years, Obama never used American aid to Israel as a lever to change the
policies he decried. Obama watched Netanyahu rebuff him again and again.
He watched as Netanyahu in 2011 travelled to the White House to publicly
repudiate his vision of a Palestinian state near the 1967 lines. He
watched as Netanyahu in 2014 ["flatly
refused"](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-the-peace-talks-secret-fruits-1.5254436)
to give Secretary of State John Kerry "[the slightest hint about the
scale of the territorial
concessions](https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-the-peace-talks-secret-fruits-1.5254436)"
he was willing to make to the Palestinians. He watched as Netanyahu used
settlement growth to
"[sabotage](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4515821,00.html),"
in the words of one American official, Kerry's efforts at brokering a
two-state deal. Then, after all that --- and after Netanyahu's fervent
lobbying against the Iran nuclear agreement --- Obama in 2016 rewarded
him with the largest military aid package in Israeli history. "[America
is a thing you can move very
easily](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/checkpoint-washington/2010/07/netanyahu_america_is_a_thing_y.html),"
Netanyahu once boasted to settlers. Obama and Trump have both
illustrated the point. [The American government's capitulation --- under
both Democrats and Republicans --- is the unspoken elephant in the room
when Americans discuss Israel's embrace of permanent
occupation.]{.underline} It is impossible to understand the looming
death of the two-state solution without understanding that, for more
than a twenty-five years, no American president has made Israel pay a
price for undermining it. During that time, the notion that an American
president might refuse to subsidize policies that brutalize
Palestinians, harm America's image, and threaten Israeli democracy, has
become almost inconceivable. It's time for a new generation of American
progressives --- especially progressive Jews --- to make it conceivable
again. [One reason conditioning aid has become inconceivable is that any
American president who proposed it would be labeled anti-Israel, if not
anti-Semitic. But by that standard, these epithets should be affixed to
most of the presidents of the mid to late twentieth
century.]{.underline} During the cold war, as Nathan Thrall details in
his indispensable book, [The Only Language They
Understand](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KFWXADG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&tag=thefor03-20),
presidents we now routinely think of as pro-Israel routinely used
American aid to influence Israeli policy. When Israeli Prime Minister
David Ben-Gurion, after attacking Egypt alongside Britain and France in
1956, mused about annexing Egyptian territory, Dwight Eisenhower
threatened to end all US aid unless Israeli troops withdrew immediately.
[In 1975, when Israel refused Henry Kissinger's demand for a partial
withdrawal from the Sinai desert, which it had conquered in 1967, Gerald
Ford vowed a
"[reassessment](https://www.amazon.com/Other-Arab-Israeli-Conflict-Americas-Monograph/dp/0226769623?tag=thefor03-20)"
of "our relations with Israel," and refused any new military or economic
assistance until the withdrawal was done.]{.underline} When Israel
invaded Lebanon in 1977, Jimmy Carter told Menachem Begin that Israel's
use of American armored personnel carriers violated the [Arms Export
Control
Act](https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/?id=ddtc_kb_article_page&sys_id=b9a933addb7c930044f9ff621f961932),
which prevented American weaponry from being used for offensive
operations. Unless Israel left Lebanon immediately, Carter warned,
future arms sales "will have to be terminated." In 1982, when the Reagan
administration [determined](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/RL30982.pdf)
that Israel's use of cluster bombs in Lebanon may have violated
America's Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement with the Jewish state,
Reagan banned new sales of the bombs to Israel for six years. In 1991,
George H.W. Bush [initially
refused](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/18/world/bush-rejects-israel-loan-guarantees.html)
to give Israel the \$10 billion in loan guarantees it requested to
resettle Soviet immigrants until it froze settlement growth in the West
Bank. [This history not only undercuts the claim that conditioning
American aid reflects hostility to Israel, it also undercuts the claim
that conditioning aid doesn't work. In recent years, former diplomats
like [Dennis
Ross](https://www.amazon.com/Doomed-Succeed-U-S-Israel-Relationship-Truman/dp/0374536449?tag=thefor03-20),
and establishment American Jewish leaders like [Malcolm
Hoenlein](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-searches-for-middle-east-peace/2012/07/14/gJQAQQiKlW_story.html?utm_term=.49fab39d1523),
have insisted that only American reassurance, not American pressure,
produces Israeli concessions.]{.underline} But during the cold war,
American pressure produced Israeli concessions again and again. When
Eisenhower threatened American aid in 1956, Israeli troops began leaving
Egypt within 36 hours. [Ford's threat to halt new arms sales forced a
partial Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai in 1975 and Carter's threat
forced Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon in 1977.]{.underline} The
following year, Carter again threatened aid during the Camp David talks
that led to Israel leaving the Sinai completely. And although Bush
failed to restrain settlement growth, his initial refusal to provide
loan guarantees, according to the [Oxford
historian](https://www.amazon.com/Iron-Wall-Israel-Norton-Paperback/dp/0393321126?tag=thefor03-20)
Avi Shlaim, "forced" Israel to participate in the 1991 Madrid
Conference, where [for the first
time](https://adst.org/2015/10/the-1991-madrid-peace-conference/) it
publicly negotiated with a delegation of Palestinians. Of course,
American pressure was rarely the sole reason for Israel's actions. Had
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat not offered peace, it's unlikely Israel
would have fully left the Sinai. Had Palestinians not launched the first
intifada, which raised the price of Israel's occupation, and had the PLO
not recognized Israel's existence, it's unlikely Israel would have
signed the 1993 Oslo Accords. Had Saudi Arabia not unveiled the Arab
Peace Initiative in 2002, Ariel Sharon may not have withdrawn Israeli
settlers from Gaza in a bid to
[undercut](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20202970?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
the Saudi effort three years later. [Palestinian and Arab behavior
matters. And it matters who leads Israel]{.underline}. But Israelis are
more likely to elect rejectionists to lead them --- and rejectionists
are more likely to remain rejectionists once in office --- when they
know their rejectionism will not harm Israel's most important alliance.
Netanyahu's decade-long political dominance in Israel, and his
decade-long defiance in Washington, would simply not have been possible
under the old rules. Which is why progressives need to bring back those
old rules --- or at least a modified version of them --- if they truly
want Israel to change course. [To condition American aid on Israeli
behavior would not single Israel out. In theory, the [Foreign Assistance
Act](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R43361.pdf), as amended in the late
1990s, prohibits the United States from providing aid or training to any
foreign military units that have committed "gross violations of
internationally recognized human rights."]{.underline} Congress also
places [additional human rights
conditions](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hjres31/BILLS-116hjres31enr.pdf)
on American aid to numerous specific governments, including Afghanistan,
Burma, Cambodia, Columbia, El Salvador, Egypt, Guatemala, Haiti,
Honduras, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Before Trump ended American assistance
to the Palestinian Authority, its
[aid](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22967.pdf) was among the most
heavily conditioned of all. What distinguishes American aid to Israel is
precisely its exemption from the rules and limitations that govern
assistance to other nations. While the United States [phased
out](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf)economic assistance to
the Jewish state a decade ago, Israel receives far more military aid
than any country where the United States is not currently at war.
Outside of active American combat zones like Afghanistan, Iraq and
Syria, the United States gives most of its military aid through
something called Foreign Military Financing: a line of credit through
which governments can buy American weapons. In Trump's 2019 budget
request, [61 percent](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) of
that foreign military financing goes to Israel. Israel also receives its
financing in a more advantageous way than other countries. Every other
foreign government receives a set amount of money per year, which it can
spend on American weapons. Seth Binder of the Project on Middle East
Democracy compares it to a debit card: You can only spend what America
has already given you. Israel, by contrast, enjoys something called
"cash-flow financing." Binder compares it to a credit card: Israel can
buy American weapons merely by committing to spend money America will
give it in the future. Under the Memorandum of Understanding Obama
announced in 2016, Israel is due to receive \$3.8 billion per year until
2028. And because of cash-flow financing Israel can spend some of that
future money now. That helps it buy expensive items --- as it did in
2017 when it purchased [17 F-35 fighters at close to \$100 million per
plane](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-finalizes-agreements-to-buy-17-more-f-35-jets/)
--- which would be hard to afford using America's aid for only one
particular year. The United States also gives Israel its aid right away.
While most other nations can access American aid only when they agree
upon an arms purchase, Israel is given a lump sum at the beginning of
every fiscal year. Since Israel doesn't spend all that money right away,
it puts the rest in the bank, where it accrues interest, which makes the
amount it actually receives in American aid even higher than the
official \$3.8 billion figure. [Finally, Israel is the only nation that
can spend part of its aid buying weapons from its own manufacturers, not
those in the United States. In that way, Israel has used American
assistance to fund its defense industry, which now ranks as the [8th
largest](https://www.statista.com/chart/17316/share-of-global-arms-exports-by-country/)arms
exporter in the world]{.underline}. The ten-year deal Obama signed in
2016 phases out this "offshore procurement" in 2028. Israel, however, is
still allowed to spend [at least 20 percent of its
aid](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33222.pdf) on Israeli weaponry
through 2024, and smaller percentages after that: A total of [more than
\$5.6
billion](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3123877-2016-September-14-US-Israel-MOU.html).
But even observers who acknowledge that it's not inherently anti-Israel
to condition American aid, and that such conditionality has proven
effective at changing Israeli behavior in the past, might still resist
doing so for one simple and understandable reason: Security. Israel
faces genuine threats, both from hostile governments like Iran and
violent groups like Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Hezbollah. American aid
helps protect Israel from them. [Americans should care about keeping
Israelis safe. That means continuing to give Israel the roughly \$500
million per year the US currently provides for missile defense and
guaranteeing Israel's military edge over its regional foes]{.underline}.
But there are ways to condition aid that don't weaken Israeli security.

#### unconditional support of Israel is the reason we lack credibility in democracy- only being conditional solves

AFFECT HOST NATION DEMOCRATIZATION?"
<https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1060022.pdf>)//ellalaur

Carothers and Marina Ottaway expressed the following themes regarding
democracy promotion in the Middle East. First, the gradualist, top-down
approach to democratization rarely works.158 Second, democratization
requires opposition groups with large constituencies to form political
parties that can truly compete with the incumbent for power, and those
are typically Islamist groups, not democratic political parties. 159
Democracy's ideological challengers (e.g., Islamism and nationalism) do
not have enough mass appeal to replace it as the world's dominant
political system.160 [However, democracy's primacy is not assured, and
it still faces entrenched political challenges in many countries, which
complicate the already complex process of democratization.161 Third,
external actors have minimal influence compared to domestic political
power brokers.162 Fourth, the United States lacks pro-democracy
credibility because of its unconditional support for Israel, its neglect
of Palestinians' rights, and its consistent support for friendly
autocrats in recent decades.163 They concluded that "outside actors
will]{.underline}

in most instances not be the primary determinants of change\[, but\]
they can make positive contributions."164 [Carothers argued that
external aid is somewhat influential, but not as much as donors would
like to think. He mentioned that the 1991 U.S. Congress requirement for
IMET to emphasize to new democracies "civilian control of the armed
forces, human rights, and other democracy-related topics."165 He argued
that IMET (including E-IMET) is an ineffective tool for changing
civil-military relations, because militaries and government
bureaucracies are deeply entrenched and resistant to institutional
change, even if they favor democratization, which they often do not.166
It is not a matter of training, but one of incentives]{.underline}.
Joshua Kurlantzick concurred that the U.S. IMET program "is not
effectively promoting democracy and respect for civilian command of the
armed forces."167 He recommended more rigorous human rights screening as
a pre-requisite for funding foreign officer involvement in U.S. training
programs. [He asserted that "failing to use U.S. training to emphasize
respect for democratic institutions sends a message that assistance does
not distinguish between abusive and law-abiding militaries."168 The
second mechanism is that the presence or absence of host nation
characteristics, historical experiences, or societal pre-conditions
influence democratization more than U.S. SA. Seymour M. Lipset explained
how past British rule is highly correlated with
democracy]{.underline}.169 It is a historical, institutional influence
that is particularly relevant to the Pakistan case study, and it
supports the idea that prior experience with democracy and civil society
support democratic consolidation. [Stephen M. Walt argued that U.S.
democracy promotion is best accomplished by diplomacy and by setting a
credible democratic example domestically, not by "foreign-imposed regime
change."170 His logic is that there are many societal pre-requisites for
democracy to thrive, and democratization by military intervention
"almost always triggers violent resistance."171 He added that
non-military foreign policy tools can be effective when applied to
countries who have budding democratic movements and the economic, legal,
and social precursors to democracy.]{.underline}

TEL AVIV: [A new crisis erupted in the Persian Gulf]{.underline} Friday
[when Iran's Revolutionary Guards announced they had seized a British
oil tanker]{.underline}, and appeared to seer it toward a Guard facility
on the Iranian island of Qeshm. The seizure [sends a new jolt of tension
through the region]{.underline}, a day after the US Navy said it had
brought down an Iranian drone that had flown too close to the USS Boxer
in the Strait of Hormuz.

[In nearby Israel, with elections looming and Iran ramping up
pressure]{.underline} for talks to resume on lifting sanctions, **[the
new incidents appear to some to be proof that war may be creeping
near.]{.underline}**

"[Some countries will only wake up to the Iranian threat when nuclear
missiles fall on European soil]{.underline}" Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said July 16.

This harsh comment **[reflects the growing concern in
Israel]{.underline}** that Washington might ease sanctions imposed on
Iran, and some European nations will continue to adhere to the nuclear
deal [as a result of declarations by senior Iranian political
figures.]{.underline} "They are the masters of sweet deceiving talk," an
Israeli expert on Iran said.

"[**The Iranians are now shortening the time to the point where they
will have enough enriched Uranium for a nuclear bomb**. They lie when
they declare that they are not working to achieve nuclear
capability]{.underline}" Brig. Gen. (Reserve) Yossi Kuperwasser told
Breaking Defense. Kuperwasser was head of the research division in the
Israel Defense Force (IDF) Military Intelligence division and director
general of the Israel Ministry of Strategic Affairs.

In an exclusive interview, the intelligence expert said **[the Iranians
had no intention to stop their race to a nuclear weapon.]{.underline}**
The JCPOA agreement talked about keeping them one year away from the
point where they have enough enriched uranium for a bomb: "I assess that
now [they are eight months from this point and the time is being
shortened]{.underline}."

The intelligence expert said that **[Teheran has a clear strategic plan
to build a military nuclear capability]{.underline}**: "[They continue
with this strategy but use all the tricks in the book to disguise
it]{.underline}."

In a clear sign of just how frustrated the Israeli government is with
continuing talks about lifting Iranian sanctions, Netanyahu urged the EU
to act immediately against Iran. In a video posted on his social media
accounts he invoked the memory of Britain's failed attempt to appease
Nazi Germany on the eve of World War II.

"The response by the European Union to the Iranian violations \[of the
nuclear deal\] reminds me of the European appeasement of the 1930s,"
Netanyahu said in the Hebrew-language clip. "Also then, there was
someone who buried his head in the sand and didn't see the approaching
danger.

"It seems that [there are those in Europe who won't wake up until
Iranian nuclear missiles fall on European soil]{.underline}. And [then,
of course, it will be too late]{.underline}. In any case, we will
continue to do everything necessary to prevent Iran from obtaining
nuclear weapons," added the prime minister.

Earlier this month, [Iran announced that it had exceeded a 300 kilogram
stockpile limit for 3.67 percent enriched uranium and had started
enriching to 4.5 percent fissile purity.]{.underline}

[Nuclear experts are concerned that Iran's enrichment moves could
shorten the year-long period it would need to produce the 90% enriched
uranium required for a nuclear weapon.]{.underline}

Iran's actions are not "considered to be significant non-compliance," EU
foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said at a press conference, as
European foreign ministers held crisis talks about saving the JCPOA
nuclear deal.

In his visit this week to the U.S., Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad
Javad Zarif highlighted what he called the world's rejection of
America's unilateral policies, saying it's time for Washington to
"return to the international community".

Zarif said on Monday his country does not want a war with the US but
added that President Trump must lift harsh economic sanctions on Tehran
to clear the way for negotiations.

[The skepticism in Israel in about the latest Iranian declarations
remains deep.]{.underline}

Retired Maj. Gen. Amos Gilad told Breaking Defense that "[because of the
US sanctions they may slow the race towards the bomb, and instead make
some show of force, but **the Iranians will continue the race and will
have a nuclear bomb."**]{.underline}

Gilad served as Director of Policy and Political-Military Affairs at the
Ministry of Defense. During his 30 years of service at the IDF, Gilead
had been, among other positions, head of the Military Intelligence
Research Division.

[Israel has declared time after time that it won't accept Iran armed

Security Affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey,
California, "**[The U.S. and Iran Are Marching Toward
War]{.underline}**", Foreign Affairs,

BIB)

With each passing day, the United States and Iran draw each other deeper
into conflict. So far, they have stopped short of war. But [the
likelihood of an armed conflict increases with every additional
provocation]{.underline}, [whether it is an attack on a civilian tanker
ship or another round of sanctions]{.underline}. Both countries, with
their all-or-nothing strategies, are to blame. President Donald Trump's
administration has pursued a "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran
built on suffocating economic sanctions and a de facto oil and gas
embargo. [Iran has pursued a maximum resistance strategy, escalating
into attacks on shipping lanes, downing a U.S. drone]{.underline} over
the Persian Gulf, [and rejecting out of hand all opportunities for
de-escalatory talks]{.underline} with Washington. **[With both states
unwilling to back down, the march toward war continues.]{.underline}**

A DEEPER SOURCE OF CONFLICT

That relations could have deteriorated to this degree is remarkable.
Only four years ago, Washington and Tehran signed a historic
multilateral agreement that curtailed Iran's nuclear enrichment program
in exchange for U.S. sanctions relief. The deal didn't end the mistrust
between the two countries, nor did it solve long-standing disagreements
about Iran's foreign policy in the Middle East, but it created a
much-needed mechanism for diplomatic engagement, which the deal's
proponents saw as necessary to avoid a war.

Trump was an outspoken critic of the deal on the campaign trail, and
upon taking office, he began to ratchet up pressure on Tehran. For all
its faults, the Trump administration at least seemed to grasp a crucial
fact: although [Iran's nuclear program had become a focal point of
U.S.-Iranian tensions]{.underline}, it was never the real source of
acrimony between the two countries. The roots of those [tensions lay
deeper]{.underline}---**[in Iran's support for militant groups at war
with Israel]{.underline}**, such as Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad,
and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and in its ties to enemies of the United
States' Gulf allies, such as the Houthis in Yemen. No less consequential
was Iran's support for Iraqi militias that killed hundreds of U.S.
military personnel at the height of the Iraq war and that continue to
threaten U.S. troops there.

Hoping to induce a change in the Islamic Republic's behavior, Trump
withdrew from the deal in 2018 and embarked on a sanctions-based
"maximum pressure" campaign. His [administration presented Tehran with a
list of 12 demands]{.underline}, most of which [concerned Iran's
regional activities,]{.underline} with the remainder relating to the
country's [nuclear and ballistic missile programs]{.underline}. Taken
together, [Trump's conditions essentially asked Iran to abandon its
grand strategy and surrender its most valuable military
deterrents]{.underline}. In exchange, the United States promised not
only to lift sanctions on Iran but also to help restore its economy and
normalize diplomatic relations.

The Islamic Republic, unsurprisingly, rejected the demands outright.
Tehran then looked to Europe, Russia, and China, hoping that some or all
of these actors would pressure the Trump administration to walk back its
demands or else provide a means of bypassing the U.S. sanctions regime.
Yet Iran had apparently neither amassed enough clout nor earned
sufficient goodwill to secure foreign backing against the United States.
[The regime was effectively alone.]{.underline}

[THE LOGIC OF ESCALATION]{.underline}

[With U.S. sanctions beginning to take their toll, Iran needed to find a
way out of this bind.]{.underline} It had three options: It could give
in to U.S. demands or at least appease Washington by seeking dialogue.
It could tough it out and hope that Trump would lose his 2020 reelection
bid. Or [it could push back and raise the stakes by showing it was
prepared to escalate.]{.underline}

Judging by its recent behavior, the Islamic Republic seems to have
chosen the third option. Iran is widely believed to have been
responsible for an attack against commercial ships in the Gulf of Oman
on May 12. [U.S. officials had repeatedly warned that Iran might be
planning such a strike, and many observers anticipated that the incident
would trigger a U.S. military response]{.underline}. Instead of
escalating, however, the United States responded with calls for dialogue
without preconditions.

Assuming that Iran was indeed behind the attack, the operation was a
clear victory for Tehran. By mounting a costly but nonlethal attack on
civilian shipping lanes, it had shifted U.S. policy from escalation to
dialogue. Trump followed through by asking Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe to deliver a letter to Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei,
expressing his desire for talks. But when Abe met with Khamenei in
Tehran on June 13, both the letter and the offer for dialogue were
summarily dismissed. That same day, two more oil tankers, including a
Japanese-flagged vessel, were attacked in the Gulf of Oman. The United
States again pegged Iran as the probable culprit, and this time the U.S.
Navy provided surveillance video showing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC) personnel onboard a patrol craft removing a suspected
limpet mine from the hull of one of the tankers before speeding off
toward the Iranian port at Bandar-e-Jask.

[Iran had engineered an opportunity for dialogue and promptly squandered
it.]{.underline} Even if the U.S. overture was insincere, as Iran's
leaders probably assumed, Iran never cared to test it. Appearing open to
de-escalatory dialogue would have won Iran leverage with the United
States and sympathy from the international community.
[Instead]{.underline}, Khamenei flippantly rejected the off-ramp he'd
been offered, embarrassing the prime minister of a neutral foreign power
and **[risking open war with the United States]{.underline}** by
attacking civilian targets in the Gulf of Oman.

[Such behavior is]{.underline} counterproductive and dangerous, but [not
altogether unexpected]{.underline}, given the tight boundaries Khamenei
has imposed for how to engage with the United States: Iran's leader has
demanded a complete reversal of the Trump administration's policy but
refuses to engage in talks while sanctions are still in place.
[Unwilling to suffer through sanctions or seek compromise, Iran has only
one remaining option: **to escalate and challenge the Trump
administration**'s resolve.]{.underline}

In keeping with this logic, [Iran proceeded on June 20 to shoot down a
U.S. Navy surveillance drone over international waters]{.underline}.
(Iran claims the drone was over Iranian territorial waters.) The choice
of an unmanned target likely signaled Tehran's desire to escalate within
limits, but its action still forced an American response. Trump
reportedly ordered a series of U.S. strikes against Iranian missile and
radar positions but halted the operation at the last minute. Instead,
the United States claimed to have carried out limited cyberattacks
targeting command-and-control nodes for Iran's missile systems. The
[Trump]{.underline} administration also [announced additional sanctions
on a massive financial conglomeration]{.underline} controlled by
Khamenei and on a host of IRGC navy commanders---and warned of possible
future sanctions against Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.

Trump's response shows that Washington has become just as boxed in as
Tehran. **[The president's policies have led the United States to the
brink of an elective war with Iran]{.underline}**, and his
administration's behavior---[especially the threat of sanctions against
Iran's top diplomat]{.underline}---has [undercut the sincerity of his
repeated calls for talks.]{.underline} Sanctions seem to be the only
tool the administration is comfortable with, but at this point new
sanctions are almost ceremonial, since the most economically damaging
ones have long ago been enacted. Even so, they make negotiations more
difficult: following the latest round of sanctions, Iranian officials
declared any window for diplomacy closed for good---an admittedly rich
declaration given Iran's previous refusal to engage in talks.

[Neither side seems to want a war, but both are steadily moving in that
direction.]{.underline}

Over the last week, the rhetoric on both sides has sunk to the level of
schoolyard taunts. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani snapped that "The
White House has become stricken with mental disability." Trump, perhaps
responding to some news reports that rendered Rouhani's Persian more
crudely as "retarded," shot back with what seemed like a new U.S.
redline, tweeting, "[Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met
with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean
obliteration."]{.underline}

What remains are [two states unwilling to compromise]{.underline},
unable to talk, and [too proud to back down]{.underline}. Neither side
seems to want a war, but both are steadily moving in that direction,
boxed in by their own maximalist policies and intransigence. But peace
will not come through attacking ships or shooting slow planes out of the
sky. [A lasting solution to the crisis requires compromise and an end to
Iran's destabilizing foreign policy in the region]{.underline}. These
days, it seems less and less likely that Iran will follow this
path---but it's the one the Iranian people deserve.

#### Israeli missile defense effectively deters Iranian aggression -- continued investment key

[Israeli superiority in missile defense]{.underline}

[The most likely war that Israel will face is one involving missiles and
rockets.]{.underline} Hezbollah possesses an estimated 100,000 missiles
and rockets, and Hamas an estimated 10,000.51 [Iran can strike Israel
with ballistic missiles and continues to advance its missile
programs]{.underline}. **[Missile defense is thus critical to dissuade
enemies and to reassure Israel]{.underline}**. Fortunately, [Israel
possesses what may be the most effective layered missile defense
capability in the world]{.underline}. The Iron Dome is a one-of-a-kind
system [designed to shoot down short-range rockets]{.underline},
including the most rudimentary systems launched by Hamas from Gaza. Iron
Dome deployed in 2011. [It achieved an 85]{.underline} percent success
rate in Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 **[and a 90 percent success
rate]{.underline}** in Operation Protective Edge in 2014.52 Its command
system [can detect where a rocket will land, allowing Israel
to]{.underline} judiciously [employ its interceptors]{.underline}
against only those rockets that threaten a valuable target. Meanwhile,
[the Arrow 3 missile defense system can protect against long-range
ballistic missiles**, such as those that Iran might
launch**]{.underline} against the Jewish State. The Arrow 3 has an
extended range and [can engage missiles close to their point of
launch]{.underline}, meaning that [Israel could conceivably destroy an
Iranian ballistic missile while it was still over Iran]{.underline}.53
Finally, David's Sling offers a middle layer of defense against short-
and medium-range ballistic missiles. I[ron Dome has proven itself in
combat, and David's Sling and Arrow have tested successfully, though
they have not yet been used in combat.]{.underline}

[**Continued investment in reliable and superior missile defense systems
would reassure Israel and dissuade enemies**. It would reduce the risk
of an adversary cheating on a nuclear arms]{.underline} control
agreement, as well as the likelihood that Israel would find itself in a
Samson-like situation. Meanwhile, Israel can threaten Iran with its
Jericho ballistic missiles, against which [Tehran has no comparable
missile defense capability]{.underline}. Israel can also deter threat
actors in Lebanon, Syria, and the Palestinian Territories with
conventional force. Despite the conventional wisdom that the 2006
Lebanon War was a political victory for Hezbollah, the group's leader,
Hassan Nasrallah, remarked that he would "[absolutely not" have provoked
Israel into that war had]{.underline} he known the [damage that it would
inflict on his constituents.54]{.underline}

[Israeli Defenses]{.underline}

**[Another factor that complicates Iranian strategic planning is
Israel's expanding missile defense program]{.underline}**, [composed of
the Israeli Arrow system and the US-produced Patriot PAC-2
system]{.underline}. The only Iranian weapon systems that may be able to
penetrate Israeli defenses are longrange ballistic missiles, currently
undergoing development and testing. Iranian aircraft and seaborne
systems will almost certainly be unable to penetrate Israeli fighter
aircraft and other defenses.27 **[Missile defense is one of the most
important guarantees of Israel's future security]{.underline}**,
although it is laden with technological as well as command and control
challenges. [Currently, the Israelis seek to expand their existing
missile defenses into an elaborate, layered system of protection,
capable of defending against any potential foe or array of
threats]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} level of protection [involves a
number of different interceptor systems]{.underline} designed [to
destroy incoming ballistic missiles at various ranges and
altitudes]{.underline}. The idea is for the longest range, high-altitude
defensive missiles (Arrow 3, as yet undeployed) to destroy all or most
of the incoming systems far from Israel. "Leakers" from this first line
of defense would then be intercepted by shorter-range interceptors,
including the Arrow 2 and the Patriot PAC-2 and PAC-3.28 The backbone of
this defensive umbrella is the Arrow interceptor missile system, which
has been under development since the mid-1980s. The development of this
particular defensive system has received an especially high priority as
a result of the Iraqi missile strikes against Israel in 1991.
Thirty-nine Iraqi extended-range Scud (al Hussein) missiles were fired
at Israel, some of which penetrated Israel's Patriot defenses and hit
targets with their conventional warheads.29 At that time, the Arrow was
not yet operational. [Lessons from that conflict served to dramatically
intensify Israeli interest in missile defense]{.underline}. While [there
is probably no such thing as leakproof missile defense, the protection
of a small nation with a limited number of targets is much more
achievable than protecting a large span of territory]{.underline} such
as the United States. [**One of the major concerns for the Israelis who
are developing missile defenses is** the potential for **Iran to develop
more sophisticated missiles**]{.underline} having penetration aids
capable of spoofing defensive systems. [**Israel's technological edge
and its ongoing collaboration with the United States regarding missile
defense are major factors** in the effort to defeat Iranian
technology.]{.underline} Although Israel's missile defense system
appears robust, even its strongest advocates point to the fact that it
has never been tested under combat conditions. This fact is responsible
for an element of uncertainty about the system's ability to protect
Israel from an actual missile attack. The legacy of the missile strikes
from Operation Desert Storm remains a disturbing precedent.

The issue of [Palestinian collateral damage is]{.underline} one of the
most important political and ideological issues facing Iranian
strategists, although it is [seldom mentioned in discussions of Iranian
strategic options.]{.underline} **[It is not possible to attack Israel
with nuclear weapons without also subjecting large numbers of nearby

such fallout is]{.underline} difficult to determine since it depends
upon a variety of factors including wind direction, type of explosion
(ground or air), and explosive yield. Nevertheless, [high lethality
rates can be expected as far away as 20 miles under normal
conditions]{.underline}.16 [Additionally, a number of Israel's one
million Arab citizens and resident aliens live near Jewish population
centers.]{.underline} **[There is a distinct possibility that
Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza would also be subjected to
fallout]{.underline}**. Unfortunately for the Palestinians, [Iranian
targeting accuracy for its long-range missiles is highly
suspect.]{.underline} The [capabilities of these systems is quite
doubtful due to ongoing problems associated with Iran's missile testing
program]{.underline}.17 [If Iranian missile accuracy is off even
slightly]{.underline}, **[the Palestinians]{.underline}**, Jordanians,
Lebanese, or Syrians **[may pay a higher price for an Iranian nuclear
strike than the Israelis]{.underline}**. This problem is further
compounded because, [unlike Israel, none of the Arab countries has a
modern civil defense system to shelter populations]{.underline}, **[and
certainly no ballistic missile defense program]{.underline}**. While [it
is conceivable that Iran might accept the deaths of a large number of
Muslims]{.underline}, such a decision would not be taken lightly by
Iranian leadership and is not consistent with their nonstop statements
of concern for the Palestinians.

#### continued investment in missile defense is the *lynchpin* for Iranian deterrence now but doesn't preclude withdrawal if Iran can be managed

The questions that arise are how dangerous will an Iran armed with
nuclear weapons be, and what will be the primary targets for Iranian
nuclear weapons should Tehran obtain such a capability? In particular,
[the incendiary rhetoric of Iran]{.underline}ian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad [suggests that]{.underline} it is reasonable to wonder if
**[there is a high risk that Iran will attack Israel with nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** [during some future period of high]{.underline}
Israeli-Iranian [tension]{.underline} (such as might emerge out of a new
Lebanon war similar to that of 2006). A related question is what can
Israel do about such a situation? This article forecasts a serious
chance of failure in the current American and global efforts to prevent
Iran from developing nuclear weapons regardless of whether such attempts
are pursued through the use of [economic and political sanctions or air
strikes. It is doubtful that either option can guarantee the end of the
Iranian nuclear program]{.underline} for reasons to be discussed later.
The more radical option of air strikes has a significant potential to
undermine other western goals in the Middle East, including stabilizing
Iraq, while failing to do much more than delay the Iranian weapons
program for a few years at best. An alternative possibility is that
[Israel as a potential Iranian strategic adversary will be able to
establish a system of deterrence **and missile defense** based on a
combination of technology it already possesses or is developing**. Such
a system would seriously limit**]{.underline} (perhaps even overcome)
**[the chances of a successful Iranian strike against
Israel]{.underline}**, [while raising the cost of even an unsuccessful
attack to apocalyptic levels for the Tehran regime]{.underline}.
[Ideally]{.underline}, **[Israeli-sponsored deterrence will not have to
be maintained indefinitely]{.underline}** [if the United States and
Europe can generate a diplomatic strategy for managing Iranian
power]{.underline}, especially if a more moderate leadership eventually
emerges in Iran. In this regard, some (but not all) Israeli leaders have
not ruled out the possibility that the United States can achieve
important diplomatic gains that will benefit Israel in negotiations with
Iran.6

<https://www.inss.org.il/person/asculaiephraim/> - BIB)

The ultimate concern that motivates most critics of Israel's missile
defense is the fear that its costs will come at the expense of
retaliatory weapons. In reality, deployment of the Arrow did not, as far
as is known, block or slow down any other Israeli R&D or acquisitions
program. From various statements of Israeli officials as well as from
hints in the public domain, it can be reasonably assumed that Israel has
not given up any offensive option against Iran. [The zero sum game
feared by the critics concerning investment in offensive versus
defensive weapons is illusory]{.underline}. [In Israel's particular
situation, missile defense is not slated to replace offensive options --
on the contrary, it is deployed to protect them]{.underline}. The task
of Israel's [missile shield is]{.underline} not [to ensure]{.underline}
against the penetration of a single nuclear missile -- this cannot be
achieved with confidence in any case -- but to enhance the
[survivability of the retaliatory assets]{.underline}, thus [posing an
existential dilemma to any aggressor]{.underline}. In the absence of any
communication channels with the leadership **[of a nuclear Iran, an
Israeli missile shield will serve as the most visible survivability
measure]{.underline}**, and each successful test will send another
powerful reminder of Iran's dilemma. At the same time, defense must not
be seen as a comprehensive solution for achieving deterrence. The first
and foremost condition for a credible deterrence is devastating
retaliation assets. Missile defense's mission is to secure the
survivability of those assets. It would be better for Israel and the
entire world that Iran remain non nuclear. [Iran's
nuclearization]{.underline} will pose a powerful challenge that
[requires]{.underline} significant national resources to establish a
credible and [stable deterrence posture. The missile defense
shield]{.underline} that Israel has been prescient enough to deploy
ahead of time **[is a key element in this deterrence]{.underline}**, and

more than doubled from \$37 million in FY 2008 to \$80 million in FY
2010. **[With the mounting Iranian threat]{.underline}** and Israel\'s
role as America\'s strongest ally in the Middle East, lawmakers say**[,
Congress will need to continue to strongly fund these
programs.]{.underline}** \"I continue to view the Jewish state as
America\'s most important military and intelligence and economic ally
and friend in that most dangerous and important part of the world,\"
said Rep. Steve Rothman (D-N.J.), who sits on the Appropriations
subcommittees on Defense, Homeland Security and State and Foreign
Operations. \"Therefore, [considering that those who still threaten
Israel continue to ramp up their efforts in obtaining more]{.underline}
lethal and accurate [weaponry]{.underline}, [it serves]{.underline}
America\'s vital national interests in protecting Israel [to continue to
provide]{.underline} her with a [substantial qualitative and
quantitative military]{.underline} and intelligence
[edge]{.underline},\" Rothman told The Hill. Facing the vow of the new
Republican House majority to slash spending across the board,
appropriators say those cuts need to be made wisely and put national
security interests first. Rep. Kay Granger (R-Texas), named chairwoman
Friday of the House Appropriations subcommittee on State and Foreign
Operations, said that her panel\'s funding has jumped 33 percent over
the past two years, and lawmakers on the subcommittee will look to those
recent funding additions first when it comes to cuts. That could include
presidential initiatives on global health and climate change. \"As we
look at cuts we have to always look at national security and the
security of our partners, which is our security, too,\" Granger told The
Hill. \"More seriously than at any time, we have to prioritize what is
the most important thing at this time,\" she said. Granger said that
Defense Secretary Robert Gates\'s [cuts to the]{.underline} Pentagon
[budget]{.underline} unveiled Thursday, which don\'t touch the
anti-missile programs, \"**[reaffirmed the need for missile
defense]{.underline}**.\" \"Given the rightful focus by this Congress on
watching every penny of taxpayer dollars we\'re going to want to make
certain that every penny spent by our subcommittee is spent wisely, and
that includes how best to continue to meet America\'s vital national
security interests in Israel\'s national security interests,\" Rothman
said. Both lawmakers cite strong bipartisan support for continuing to
fund the missile defense programs. Although specific requests in the new
year and new Congress aren\'t yet known, [funding may increase even more
as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle use the tools at their disposal,
including oversight and spending, to address the Iranian
threat.]{.underline} \"[The U.S. Congress is clearly continuing to be
strongly in support of]{.underline} our most important ally in the
region --- [Israel]{.underline} --- [and thus is concerned about any
step]{.underline} by any nation or other entity [that might threaten
her]{.underline},\" Rothman said. When it comes to those threats, the
appropriators aren\'t just [concerned about Iran]{.underline}, as
evidenced by the [Iron Dome funding to shield Israel from
attacks]{.underline} by Hamas or Hezbollah. Granger notes that Hezbollah
is now estimated to have about 45,000 missiles, four times as many since
the 2006 war when the group, considered a terrorist organization by the
U.S., fired Katyusha rockets from Lebanon into Israel. Hezbollah, a
political party that has been gaining traction in Lebanon, has been
beefing up its arsenal despite the U.N. Security Council resolution
ending the conflict that called for Hezbollah to disarm. On Dec. 22,
Rothman fired off a letter to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who
visits Washington this month, asking the European ally to back off its
plans to sell 100 anti-tank missile systems to the Lebanese Armed
Forces. \"As you know, Lebanon is in a precarious situation whereby
Hezbollah is in a powerful position to usurp the Lebanese Armed Forces
(LAF),\" Rothman wrote. \"If this were to occur, Israel would be in
grave danger of having your anti-tank missiles used against her.\"
Rothman said he wasn\'t able to get additional signatures on the letter
because members were trying to wrap up business before the holiday
break, but he said \"100 percent\" of the Defense subcommittee members
agree with him. \"The concerns expressed in my letter are shared by at
least 90 percent or more of the U.S. Congress,\" he said. Sarkozy
hasn\'t yet responded. Granger said there should be \"some very serious,
serious discussions\" about the French arms sales and other concerns
about allies potentially undermining Israeli defense efforts.
**[Washington needs to continue to \"keep the lead\" on missile
defense]{.underline}** while keeping the GOP commitment to cut funding
back to 2008 levels, she said. Granger\'s subcommittee still has some
work from last year to take up, she said, but will quickly get to
oversight hearings to figure out which programs are working, which are
not, and how spending can be done most efficiently. [\"There\'s just an
urgent need in that area to continue the very strategic partnership we
have with Israel]{.underline},\" she said. Rothman said that
appropriators will need to respond to the \"developing and ever-changing
threats that confront Israel.\" \"[Since there has been a consistent and
robust support for both joint U.S.-Israel]{.underline} military
endeavors, research and development endeavors as well [as support
for]{.underline} Israeli programs such as [the Iron Dome]{.underline} in
the past, I [fully expect there to be no break whatsoever in our strong
support]{.underline} for the Jewish state and her military and
intelligence needs,\" he said.

#### missile defense solves war and iran nukes turn the case -- makes the Palestinian condition worse

No. 94, Tel Aviv: Institute for National Security Studies, July 2008,
"How Iran Can Attain its Nuclear Capability -- and Then Use It",

[The Contribution of Israeli Missile Defense to Deterrence
Credibility]{.underline}

Military victories are predicated on the actual use of force. In
contrast, the essence of deterrence is the non-use of force to achieve
what we might call "cognitive decision." [Israel's missile defenses must
be demonstrably capable of intercepting and destroying incoming
missiles]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} Israel's [retaliatory forces
must be capable of overcoming hostile air defenses]{.underline} and
delivering devastating blows on the aggressors' territory, but their
very use -- even if they score stellar results -- will be synonymous
with the failure of deterrence. The primary measure of effectiveness for
Israel's strategic assets, whether offensive or defensive, is how
threatening they are perceived by the other side; how they fare in
actual conflict is secondary. Retaliatory systems that would be
considered vulnerable to a surprise attack are not likely to achieve the
cognitive decision that is a prerequisite for stable deterrence. In the
Cold War both superpowers achieved cognitive decision by deploying
multiple families of retaliatory systems and by using their huge land
masses for dispersion, with multiple basing modes on the ground, under
the sea, and in the air and heavy sheltering in silos (and also, at
least in the case of the Soviet Union, by extreme land mobility). This
secured the survivability of their strategic retaliation weapons beyond
any reasonable doubt. War games conducted on both sides demonstrated
that a second strike from the other side was bound to come, no matter
how devastating the first strike. Once this cognitive decision was
reached, investments in further survivability measures yielded
diminishing returns. This made missile defense superfluous at the time,
paving the way towards the ABM treaty. In contrast,
[Israel's]{.underline} tiny land area cannot offer the wide spaces
needed for dispersion, and its relatively modest economy cannot afford a
superpower-style multiplicity of retaliatory measures. Israel's
population, economic assets, and [military bases are all concentrated in
an area not much larger than Rhode Island]{.underline}. **[This, and the
perception that]{.underline}** Israel's **[investments in defense are
declining]{.underline}** over time, **[could act as powerful temptations
for an aggressive action by Iran]{.underline}**. A rational aggressor,
fanatic as it might be, [will strive to wipe out Israel's retaliatory
means before it proceeds to launch a nuclear strike on Israeli
cities.]{.underline} This, of course, would be a grave error on the side
of Iran, an error that would incur terrible consequences for Iran (as
well as Israel). The prime objective of Israel's deterrence is, then, to
dissuade Iran from making such an error in the first place. To
illustrate the point, consider Israel's main strategic strike asset --
the Israel Air Force fleet of long range attack aircraft. Open
literature on the IAF force structure and disposition13 reports that it
deploys in twelve air bases, six of which host the more modern types of
aircraft (names and locations of those air bases are provided in the
literature). Theoretically, then, a first strike by no more than six
nuclear Shahab 3 missiles -- one for each prime air base -- would be
enough to knock out Israel's airborne second strike option, paving the
way to an entirely immune follow-up strike against Israel's centers of
population. [It is reasonable to assume that the Iran would plan on
launching some extra Shahab missiles to compensate for malfunctions and
inaccuracies]{.underline}, but in any event, it is obvious that the
concentration of Israel's strategic assets in a small number of
locations requires just a handful of Shahab missiles to take them out,
not much more than the salvo of Iraqi missiles that hit Israel during
the Gulf War in 1991. **[Enter Israel's missile defense
system]{.underline}**, which changes the situation completely. As
pointed out by Pedatzur, rational Iranian planners would have to factor
in an [efficient defense system with an upper performance limit equal to
what Israel has demonstrated in repeated tests]{.underline} -- [any
lesser assumption would be tantamount to gambling with Iran's continued
existence]{.underline}. In concrete terms, this means that the [Iranians
will have to factor in a **kill rate for the Arrow of at least 80
percent** in each individual engagement]{.underline}. According to open
literature,14 Israel has now deployed three Arrow batteries. Each
battery includes eight launchers each holding six interceptors, for a
total of 144 [Arrow interceptors]{.underline} deployed and ready to
fire. In addition, Israel deploys several Patriot [PAC 2 batteries, to
be upgraded to PAC 3]{.underline} capabilities, [providing the second
tier for its missile shield]{.underline}.15 A simple statistical
analysis indicates that [if every single Iranian Shahab aimed at an IAF
base is engaged by one single Arrow missile, three out the six targeted
bases will survive with absolute certainty and that **there is a 90
percent chance that four bases will remain untouched**]{.underline}
(figure 1, curve 1). With the launching of only six interceptors, [the
bulk of the Arrow and Patriot missile will remain ready to face a
follow-up strike]{.underline}. [From the point of view of the
aggressor]{.underline}, [this is]{.underline} tantamount to [failure,
**since enough air bases will survive to launch a massive
retaliation**.]{.underline} Iran could increase its chances of taking
out the IAF on the ground by launching several Shahab missiles at each
air base. Curves 2, 3, 4, and 5 in figure 1 show the chances of survival
of the IAF prime bases against salvos of 12, 18, 24, and 30 Shahab
missiles, respectively, when each is engaged by a single Arrow or
Patriot interceptor. [In the case of a massive salvo of 30 nuclear
Shahabs]{.underline}, each engaged by one Israeli interceptor, there is
a 90 percent chance that five out of the six prime IAF bases will be
hit, seriously eroding Israel's capability to launch a retaliatory
strike. However, professional Iranian [planners will have to take into
account a multi-tier defense system that can engage each incoming Shahab
twice, three times, and even more.]{.underline}16 Again, simple
calculations show that when engaging each of the thirty incoming threats
by two interceptors, [**Israel's missile shield could destroy the vast
majority of the incoming Shahab missiles and ensure the survival of at
least three bases** and possibly four]{.underline}, as seen in curve 6
of figure 1. This simple war game could be extended even further with
increasingly heavier salvos, countered by increasing number of
engagements, [with the same disappointing results from Iran's
perspective.]{.underline} Diluting the salvos with conventional Shahabs
to exhaust Israel's interceptor stockpiles will decrease the prospects
of destroying the IAF, since the impact from a conventional warhead is
not likely to impede its air operations seriously. [A preliminary strike
at the missile defense assets (provided the Iranians know their
location) will again yield disappointing results since]{.underline}
**[the system will defend itself with the same efficiency]{.underline}**
-- and between the strike on its missile defense and the subsequent
strike on its air bases, the IAF could slip through a devastating strike
package. It should be noted that launching a massive 30 nuclear Shahabs
salvo is a major undertaking even for a much more advanced nuclear power
such as France or the UK. [The lethal effect of thirty nuclear bombs
going off almost simultaneously]{.underline} -- near the ground or in
the upper atmosphere -- **[will be devastating not only to Israel's
population but to the Palestinian]{.underline}**, Lebanese, Jordanian,
and Egyptian populations. Under certain meteorological
**[conditions]{.underline}**, the lethal effects could spread to Iraq
and even to Iran itself. This simple war game can be repeated by any
Iranian science student with a \$25 calculator and access to the
internet. Without the need for Israeli leaders to make detailed or
threatening declarations, it brings home the truth: that [Israel's
missile shield, by its very existence, overturns the strategic equation
in two ways]{.underline}. First, [it transforms]{.underline} the IAF
with its [small]{.underline} number of prime [bases from an easy
prey]{.underline} (in Iran's perception) [to an almost impregnable
objective]{.underline}. Second, [it raises the ante for Iran, forcing
its planners to specify ever-increasing salvos of nuclear
Shahabs,]{.underline} the collateral effect from which could seriously
risk Iran's own security and safety. Since all the information needed to
make such somber evaluations is readily available to Iran from its own
sources, [its stands to reason that the calculus of gains versus losses
will be sobering enough to dissuade Iran]{.underline}, even in the midst
of an ongoing crisis, from making a potentially disastrous mistake. The
cognitive decision, the crucial condition for effective deterrence, is
thus achieved. **[The stabilizing effect of Israel's missile
shield]{.underline}** goes beyond the dry arithmetic of gains versus
risks. [The Arrow system was co-developed with the US]{.underline} and
is reportedly **[designed to interoperate with US missile defense
systems]{.underline}**. The IAF holds frequent and well-advertised
missile defense exercises with the US Army and US Navy. Any Iranian
planner must factor in the presence of unknown numbers of US ground and
naval missile defense assets at the time of the planned strike. Such
assets could take part in the defensive action and catapult the
effectiveness of Israel's missile shield even beyond its published
performance. Furthermore, [an Iranian offensive action that would result
in US casualties might draw US retaliation in kind, even in the unlikely
case that Israel's retaliatory assets are overwhelmed.]{.underline}

Amid the fissile atmosphere in the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz, [a
single mistake could unleash catastrophe.]{.underline}

Earlier this week, Javad Zarif, [the Iranian foreign minister, warned of
the high stakes in play]{.underline}. \"All through history Iran has
provided security in these waters,\" he told CNN\'s Fareed Zakaria.
\"[The United States is intervening in order to make these waters
insecure for Iran. You cannot make these waters insecure for one country
and secure for others.]{.underline}\"

\"Do you believe that [as a result]{.underline} of this \-- whoever is
to blame \-- [you could have an escalation which would result in a
military incident]{.underline}?\" Zakaria asked him.

\"[In such a small body of water if you have so many foreign vessels, I
mean **accidents will happen**]{.underline}\...\" the Iranian foreign
minister replied, emphasizing that Iran did not want war and called on
all parties to \"work\" to avoid war.

He drew attention to the US killing of 290 civilian passengers on board
Iran Air flight 655, shot down by the USS Vincennes during the \"tanker
wars\" of the 1980s.

Tehran has repeatedly called for a return to negotiations with the US,
but only if the US lifts economic sanctions first. This week there were
signs that the Trump administration was preparing to make good on its
offer to talk directly with Iran, without preconditions, reportedly
tapping Senator Rand Paul as the man to make the overtures.

On board the Boxer, CNN asked Brigadier General Trollinger, the
commander of the Task Force controlling the USS Boxer, if [an apparently
minor misstep by a junior sailor or Marine could have dangerous
consequences \-- like a war]{.underline}?

\"That\'s absolutely accurate,\" the general replied. \"All the training
we do, all the education we do is the express purpose of getting after
that, to make sure that we eliminate or reduce rather\... mitigate to
the best of our ability \... any risk of miscalculation.\"

[The alternative is almost unthinkable.]{.underline} But in complex

is an option.]{.underline}

In answering the question of "[what can Iran do with it]{.underline},"
one cannot avoid the possibility that **[Iran would use its nuclear
capabilities against others]{.underline}**. It is certainly a technical
possibility. Is it also a viable proposition? [In order to deter, it is
sufficient that nuclear weapons be viewed by all, including the owner of
these weapons, as a weapon of last resort. The case of Iran cannot be
viewed in the same way.]{.underline} [Many experts claim that "the
government of Iran is rational.]{.underline}" That may well be true in a
very general way. The history of recent years demonstrates, 30 I Ephraim
Asculai however, that the Iranian government's rationale is not always
similar to that employed by others, for example Western governments.
[The basic aims of the state, the basic values of Iran, and the methods
used to achieve these aims differ markedly from those of today's Western
states.]{.underline} The theological state, [the support of
terrorism,]{.underline} the abuse of human rights, the unwillingness to
even negotiate a solution to the nuclear issue, the **[fierce statements
against Israel]{.underline}**, and many other facts [demonstrate
this]{.underline}. On the other hand, the Iranian negotiating tactics
and their use -- if not manipulation -- of the international community's
institutes and approaches are admirable, in that they try to present a
"sensible" point of view that succeeds in winning precious time for
Iran. Thus, the government is behaving in a rational way, according to
its own beliefs and political aims. Does the Iranian government view its
nuclear weapons in the same way that most of the world does? The common
wisdom is that nuclear weapons are weapons of deterrence, and are not
intended for use in anger. What are the Iranian internal constraints;
what are its checks and balances on the deployment and use of nuclear
weapons? Would Iran also view nuclear weapons mainly as a deterrent and
not as a weapon in a usable arsenal? Iran must also take into
consideration the retaliatory capabilities of those the weapons would
target, their allies, and those who would find themselves in an
untenable situation should Iran demonstrate its political capability to
attack others with nuclear weapons. What is the price Iran would be
willing to pay for such an action? These questions are not answerable at
the present time. Therefore, **[it must be assumed here that there is a
possibility the Iran would put its nuclear weapons to direct
use.]{.underline}**

Iron Dome was declared operational in early 2011. Its first major test
came in November 2012 during a weeklong Israel-Hamas conflict (termed
"Operation Pillar of Cloud/Defense" by Israel). Israeli officials claim
that Iron Dome intercepted 85% of the more than 400 rockets fired by
Gaza-based militants. Between 2012 and 2014, Israel upgraded Iron Dome's
various tracking and firing mechanisms and expanded the number of
batteries deployed from five to nine. [[During Israel's 2014 conflict

militants]{.mark}]{.underline}, media reports (generally based on
Israeli claims) seem to indicate that [[Iron Dome had a successful
interception rate close]{.mark} [to 90%]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
According to statistics reported by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF),
Gaza-based terrorist groups fired 35 projectiles into Israel in 2017, of
which the vast majority landed in open territory and an estimated 10
struck in residential areas or were intercepted by Iron Dome.39 To date,
[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [provided \$1.397 billion

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will give

the largest such aid package in U.S. history]{.underline}, under a

U.S. official said. While the package constitutes the most U.S. military
aid ever given to any country, it entails concessions by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to officials on both sides.
RELATED COVERAGE Obama says \$38 billion Israel aid package to help
ensure security Those include Israel's promise not to seek additional
funds from Congress beyond what will be guaranteed annually in the new
package, and to phase out a special arrangement that has allowed Israel
to spend part of its U.S. aid on its own defense industry instead of on
American-made weapons, the officials said. Nearly 10 months of drawn-out
aid negotiations underscored continuing friction between President
Barack Obama and Netanyahu over last year's U.S.-led nuclear deal with
Israel's arch-foe Iran, an accord the Israeli leader opposed. The United
States and Israel have also been at odds over the Palestinians. But the
right-wing Netanyahu decided it would be best to forge a new arrangement
with Obama, who leaves office in January, rather than hoping for better
terms from the next U.S. administration, according to officials on both
sides. ADVERTISEMENT A new pact now allows him to avoid uncertainties
surrounding the next president, whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or
Republican Donald Trump, and to give Israel's defense establishment the
ability to plan ahead. Obama's aides wanted a new deal before his
presidency ends, seeing it as an important part of his legacy.
Republican critics accuse him of not being attentive enough to Israel's
security, which the White House strongly denies, and of taking too hard
of a line with the Israeli leader. "DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD" The \$38
billion memorandum of understanding covers U.S. fiscal years 2019-2028
and succeeds the current \$30 billion MOU signed in 2007, which expires
at the end of fiscal 2018. "Prime Minister Netanyahu and I are confident
that the new MOU will make a significant contribution to Israel's
security in what remains a dangerous neighborhood," Obama said in a
written statement. The agreement was signed at the State Department by
U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon and by Jacob Nagel, acting
head of Netanyahu's national security council. According to a White
House "fact sheet," [[the deal includes]{.underline}]{.mark}: -annual

hasn\'t done badly against short-range Hamas rockets in the recent
fighting). Considering we could be talking about Iranian WMDs, a leaky
missile defense shield isn\'t exactly reassuring.

But this is only part of the equation. Just as in the Cold War,
[uncertainty is everything in nuclear deterrence.]{.underline} While
Iran could undoubtedly overwhelm Israeli missile defenses by firing
enough rockets, [the Arrow system means Tehran can\'t be sure how many
missiles would get through]{.underline}, or which targets would or would
not be hit. [The effect may be more psychological than
physical]{.underline} (no less for [providing psychological reassurance
to the Israeli public]{.underline}), but [it is]{.underline} still
[significant]{.underline}.

#### Israel will flip their shit -- increases settlements, lash out leads to war 

**Pearl '15** (Mike Pearl, interviewer at Vice News, interviewing Rob
Pinfold, a PhD Candidate in War Studies at King\'s College, London,
studying the topic of Israeli withdrawal from territory. He currently
works as a Research and Teaching Assistant at the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, "We Asked a Military Expert What Would Happen if the US
Stopped Giving Money to Israel," *Vice News*, 3/6/15,
<https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/dpwnkm/what-would-happen-if-the-us-stopped-giving-money-to-israel-305>)

VICE: Hi, Rob! What would happen if the US stopped sending money to
Israel?

Rob Pinfold: I think it would be a mess for Israel basically.

Would it be good for the US?

[The US would have a lot less traction over Israel]{.underline}. It
would be a downside for the US, and it would also be a downside for the
\[Middle East\]. For a long time the US has been trying to use its aid
politically to change Israel\'s behavior.

What behaviors wouldn\'t the US be able to control?

[I think any end to this aid would mean that Israel would be much more
likely to take radical moves that would not necessarily have the support
of the international community. I think it would be
dangerous.]{.underline}

What are the likely events in the short term?

[I think that the big difference you\'d see straightaway is an
escalation in settlement building because the Israeli right would really
be able to unleash it.]{.underline}

You see a lot, the Israeli government in particular, they\'ve announced
some big settlement-building initiatives of several thousand homes in
East Jerusalem over the green line. And then the Americans say, \"Na-uh,
sorry, this is not happening,\" and then the idea is quieted for another
five years, and then it happens again, ad nauseam.

[But without any American influence over Israel, especially with this
aid, I think you would see a drastic exploration in settlement
building.]{.underline}

Would they attack Hamas targets in Gaza?

I think they would need to be provoked. Very, very rarely does Israel
just willy-nilly launch itself into a conflict, not just because of
influence from the US but also at the end of the day, Israel is a
democracy---so actually instigating conflict has to have that
legitimacy, otherwise it becomes a big issue.

But what if they were provoked?

[Israel in the future would be much more unpredictable and any war would
be likely to go on for a lot longer, because there wouldn\'t be one big
power to really exert the pressure and squeeze both sides into a
ceasefire]{.underline}.

And how would the US react if they couldn\'t influence them with money?

Military action is somewhat unfeasible, in my eyes, against Israel. It
just wouldn\'t happen. You might have some sort of short-term sanctions
against the regime by the US on Israel, and maybe on other belligerents
as well.

And what would the outcome be?

Israel wouldn\'t lose the conflict, that\'s for sure. They get a lot of
money from the States in terms of support in terms of the Iron Dome
anti-missile program, but at the end of the day they have enough
hardware already in the sheds to be able to thoroughly defeat any
belligerents---for example, non-state-level actors like Hamas or
Hezbollah, but also state-level actors like Iran.

I don\'t think it would be a question of turning the tide of battle it
would just be a question of how long the war would go on, how bloody it
would be, and who would get dragged in.

Who would get dragged in?

I think the US, even if they really fell out with and really strongly
dislike\[d\] Israel, would probably still work toward a cessation of
hostility as a superpower. I think that no matter what happens, we would
go back to some sort of paradigm representing what we have at the
moment. But the fighting would probably be longer and bloodier, and the
US would have less of an ability to stop it straight away.

Would Israel make moves on Iran?

[I think the Saudis would be ready to turn a blind eye to an Israeli
attack \[on Iran\], which has been suggested before. So I think again
the probability of mass-casualty warfare and violence would be much
higher if the US, tomorrow, said, \"Screw you, guys. I\'m going home.
This is too much effort.\"]{.underline}

What kind of warfare would we see?

In terms of Iranian retaliation, [Iran has a lot of medium- to
long-range missiles.]{.underline} They\'re not very accurate, but they
stopped firing them at the end of the Iran-Iraq war, so [they do have a
very hefty stockpile that they could then fire at Israel. Israel would
inevitably retaliate with their stock]{.underline}. So it\'d be quite
hard for them to launch a bombing campaign against Iran because they\'d
have to go through unfriendly territory on the way.

What might the targets of Israel\'s military action be?

I think you\'d see one Israeli strike, one very pinpointed, strategic
attack on Iranian nuclear assets. Then afterwards Israel would basically
try to hold its own, because Iran would unleash its proxies on the
region, which are primarily Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in
Lebanon.

I think we\'d see fighting very close to Israel\'s doorstep and I think
[you\'d see a lot of devastation of both Gaza and Lebanon.]{.underline}
But on the flip side you\'d also see a lot more damage to Israel\'s home
front than you\'ve seen in a very long time.

Would Iran have any luck?

The missiles that Iran has have overwhelmed the Iron Dome system. The
Iron Dome system can shoot down the missiles that you saw \[from\] Hamas
\[during the war this past summer\]. The Iron Dome can deal with that,
but it wouldn\'t be able to do with the stockpiles of rockets that Iran
has.

Would things escalate beyond exchanging missile attacks?

If there is more damage to the Israeli home front, the Israeli domestic
scene would be more willing for the Israeli military to go all out on
flattening large parts of Lebanon and Gaza. There would be much less
resistance to a ground invasion, and much less resistance to moving
troops in. Israel historically has very quick campaigns and very
decisive victories. So I think the leashes would be off, so to speak. I
think the Israeli army would be going en masse into Lebanon and into
Gaza and wherever else they\'d be getting attacked from. But the
fighting would be mainly restricted to the area around Israel, unless
they do some sort of massive campaign into Iran.

Does Israel have the fire power to successfully cripple the Iranian
nuclear program?

That\'s a tough one because it\'s anyone\'s guess, really. I don\'t know
exactly where and how the Iranians are hiding all their material.

They probably know.

It would still be very hard for Israel. Their planes would have to
refuel in midair, in enemy territory. Their equipment is very limited.
It\'s not known if they actually have any bunker-busting missiles, like
the Americans have, that can penetrate deep underground. I think we\'d
probably have to see Israeli forces in Iran---special forces teams,
demolition teams, that kind of thing.

It would have to involve some sort of covert support from the Saudis to
have a very good chance of success. It would be very, very difficult and
it would end in a lot of casualties on both the Israeli and the Iranian
side. If the Israelis want to do it, there is nothing stopping them from
doing it. If they see them as a potential threat, they will go in and
they will go in hard.

[Would the fighting be limited to just Iran, Lebanon, and
Gaza?]{.underline}

[I think it would definitely trigger a whole powder keg in the entire
region.]{.underline} You look at the Middle East today, and it\'s the
most unstable it\'s been in absolutely years. You have the Islamic State
operating out of both Iraq and Syria. They\'re making headway in Lebanon
as well. Egypt has its own problems with iihadists in the Sinai. It\'s
very unstable\... in Libya. \[And\] [any conflict with Iran would not
just be limited to Gaza, it would also spread to the West Bank where
there are a lot of Iranian agents.]{.underline}

But in the long-term, if a terrible war weren\'t immediately sparked,
how would a halt in funding from the US affect Israel\'s military
budget?

[In Israel, the military budget is very much sacrosanct. Any cut to the
military budget, and you\'re putting the state in existential
danger]{.underline}. Personally I think [you\'d see cuts to many other
social, welfare, or educational programs within Israel before you\'d see
massive, damaging cuts to the army. They\'d try to keep the military
budget as steady as possible. So you\'d see a damaging of Israeli
society.]{.underline}

[Could Netanyahu stay in power?]{.underline}

[I personally don\'t think so. If any Israeli leader were willing to
seriously jeopardize their ties \[with the US\], \[causing\] a complete
cut off of all military and financial aid, I personally---and I could be
proven wrong---I don\'t think the government would be able to withstand
the pressure within Israel that would result from that.]{.underline}

Today, [Israel's government seems strong in its belief that it has the

[government is openly hostile to Israel]{.underline}. Citing fears that
Iran would use nuclear weapons against Israel, Netanyahu has warned,
"Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons would be infinitely more costly
than any scenario you can imagine to stop it." He told Iran and other
adversaries not to "test" Israel. If the nuclear deal ruptures further
and Iran does restarting uranium enrichment, Israel might launch
targeted airstrikes against it. Risks of an Israeli strike History
suggests other countries are unlikely to actively deter Israeli military
aggression in the guise of nuclear nonproliferation. The Trump
administration has expressed anti-Iranian sentiment and is a staunch
backer of Netanyahu's government. And while European powers will
recognize preemptive Israeli strikes on nuclear facilities as a
violation of international law and of the sovereignty of Israel's
neighbors, they also see Iran's nuclear program as a grave global
security concern. A nuclear Iran could escalate ongoing Middle East
conflicts into nuclear exchanges, and, as some commentators say, spur
other regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to develop nuclear
weapons themselves. Of course, [potential Israeli attacks on Iran
present their own serious risks]{.underline}. Because most of Iran's
reactors are in full operations, air strikes may mean cutting off the
power supply to Iranian citizens and could release large amounts of
radioactive contaminants into the air. [Iran, a militarily well-equipped
country, would surely retaliate against any Israeli attacks. That, too,
would trigger a conflict that would spiral throughout the Middle
East.]{.underline}

C. TBMD IN ISRAEL

[Israel has made a fierce effort in its protection against missile
attacks]{.underline}. According to Samaan and Lasonjaras, Israel
launched its first TBM, dubbed the Arrow, in 1988, and it released an
advanced version emerged in 2000 (Arrow II).

The benefits of the Arrow with relation to its high cost has raised
concerns among experts as to whether the project is worth it. To make
the Arrow II more efficient, developers have subjected it to a variety
of tests, the most significant of which was in 2004.118 [The United
States is a significant financier and technical advisor of the TBMD
program in Israel because of U.S. strategic interests in the
region.]{.underline} The TBMD has two batteries, one near Tel Aviv and
another one in the south of Haifa. The placement of these batteries is
to boost the efficiency of defense over a large area. In general terms,
Israel continues to advance its TBMD; in tests, the Arrow II has made 14
intercepts, while the original Arrow system made nine intercepts.

1\. The Role of the United States in Israel TBMD

[The United States plays a significant role in the TBMD of Israel in a
couple of ways. First, United States has been the core co-financer of
Israel's Arrow anti-BMD system to boost Israel's security and ensure
that it could defend itself against the glaring threats from its
neighbors in the Middle East. The co-financing has also allowed the
United States to be directly associated with the TBMD in Israel; the
TBMD is a significant warning to potential enemies of Israel that it has
a strong defense mechanism.]{.underline} In 2007, the U.S. Congress
allowed the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to extend American funding of
the Arrow System Improvement Program. Additional funding enhanced the
development of Arrow III. To date, estimates show Israel has spent over
\$2.8 billion were spent on the development of the TBMD in Israel; the
United States funded over 60 percent of the costs.

It is vital to observe that [the co-financing by the United States has
allowed Israel to develop a strong missile defense system. The threat of
attack from countries with advanced programs (such as Iran) has
necessitated extensive research.120 Second, the United States plays a
significant role in the demonstration and testing of Israel's TBMD
system.]{.underline} The United States was directly involved in the
first demonstration phase in 1988 when the U.S. Department of Defense
Initiative presented Arrow I, which weighed about 2,000 kilograms. First
tested in 1995, Arrow II had a smaller weight of 1,300 kilograms.122
Further tests were run on Arrow II when successfully completing 14
intercepts. [The testing has been vital in leading to the population
trust in the effectiveness of the TBMD for the protection of the
country.]{.underline}

[Third, the United States has increased the level of research funding it
provides to Israel and the subsequent participation in the development
of Israeli missile defense systems. The biggest focus by the United
States has been the mitigation of the long-range weapons development in
the Middle East. Based on the research, focus has been placed on the
capabilities for defense against potential nonconventional missile
attacks.]{.underline}

#### US assures Israel through TBMD

MISSILE DEFENSE IN THE MIDDLE EAST," *Naval Postgraduate School*, March
2019, <https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1073667.pdf>)

3\. The Role of Israeli TBMD

The Israeli Missile Defense Organization has been at the forefront of
boosting the development of the TBMD. [Israel has been actively
researching and developing missile programs with the goal of boosting
the protection of the entire country against guerrillas, such as
Hezbollah, and other enemies, such as Syria and Iran. The role of the
Israeli BMD is to intercept hostile missiles (e.g., weapons of mass
destruction), which that have the potential of destroying any part of
Israel]{.underline}. The capability of the TBMD reaches 1,500 miles and
nine times the speed of sound, and the Arrow III has been outstanding in
terms of boosting the rate of defense against hostile missiles from
Israel's enemies. Additionally, the capacity to detect and track
missiles as far as 300 miles and disable the incoming warhead by
exploding in an estimated 40 to 50 yards of the target.125 The ability
to detect the different types of warheads makes it easier for the
defense system to destroy all types of hostile missiles entering
Israel's air space.126 [This strategy has gone a long way toward
guaranteeing Israel the desired level of safety, and the support from
the United States makes it better.]{.underline}

Israel's TBMD program has also significantly benefited from NATO since,
in both cases, the decision makers have used missile defense as a
convenient political tool.127 For instance, the development of Iron Dome
planted the political opinion that Israel needed a strong system of
defense to stand against all forms of enemies entering its space. The
TBMD has been a vital political tool for Israel and has been present in
the agenda of most politicians. Because of a strong defense mechanism
created by Arrow 3 and Iron Dome, the government has been able to
convince the population it is doing everything it can to protect the
population against any attacks. For instance, the success of the Iron
Dome during the Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012, wherein the Israeli
Defense Forces conducted a military operation in Gaza, allowed the
government to justify the need for developing stronger defensive
mechanisms that would make every citizen safe in the country.

a\. Strengths

One of [the strengths of Israeli defense is its collaboration with the
United States in a creating multilayered missile defense system, which
when compared to other missiles defense systems elsewhere, many
considered to be the most advanced.]{.underline}128 The advancement in
technology is significant because [it ensures that there is a strong
defense system for the country in terms of its security.]{.underline}
For instance, the Arrow III interceptor is a strong and multilayered
system that has given Israel a major advantage and allowed boosting its
own defense. [The country has the system to defend itself against the
current and future threats in the region, especially from such states as
Iran.]{.underline}

More so, collaborating with the United States is an advantage because of
the financial capabilities that it offers in regard to the improvement
of the Arrow system and other projects of creating defense missiles.129
[The United States has played a vital role in boosting Israel's
position]{.underline} by ensuring that it does not have to spend its own
capital by providing the effective funding required for the country to
attain its goal of building a strong and secure system. The largest
funding has been allocated for the Arrow ballistic missiles; [the United
States has cooperated with Israel in this project to provide the
necessary financial resources to build the most efficient TBMD
system.]{.underline}

Israel possesses many intermediate- or short-range warheads. It also has
a number of Patriot batteries and other sophisticated systems to react
quickly to any missile threat. In addition, its low-level missile
systems may counterattack the enemy's aircraft or any unmanned aerial
vehicles.130 [As a result, Israel is in a stable position since it can
defend itself from any major or minor missile attack in the region
effectively]{.underline}. It is constantly improving its ability to
tackle all types of missile attacks.

The TBMD capacities include the:

1\. Arrow 2 and Arrow 3, which have three batteries each and are
groundbased;

128 O'Rourke, Sea-Based Ballistic Missile Defense, 57--59.

129 Samaan and Lasconjarias, "The Israeli Experience," 3.

130 O'Rourke, Sea-Based Ballistic Missile Defense, 59--60.

2\. David's Sling, which is currently in use and can be used on ground,
naval,

or aerial platforms;

3\. Iron Dome, which has 10 batteries and is used on ground;

4\. Patriot-2, which has three batteries, is mobile, and can be used
from the

ground; and

5\. Green pine radar, which has two batteries and istransportable or can
be used

on ground.131

Israel has started the integration of naval ships into the Iron Dome
system; the project aims to protect the Israeli ships and other assets
at sea.132 Israel has successfully tested this system in simulated
projectiles that mimicked external threats in that region. Therefore,
apart from the protection on land, Israel has benefitted in terms of
achieving the protection on the sea.

The inclusion of the multilayered aerial shield into David's Sling, the
Iron Dome, and the Raytheon's Centurion Super machine gun means that
Israel's active missile defense program has reached success. As such,
Israel is the first country in the Middle East able to protect itself
against threats of any range; this ability definitely provides Israel
with a strategic position in the region.133 [Diverse systems ensure that
the country does not experience any threat or fear of threats.
Consequently, the government could easily assure all citizens of the
high level of protection against attacks.]{.underline}

b\. Weaknesses

[One of the weaknesses that Israel faces is that it is a very small
country. Therefore, the presence of any ballistic missiles in the Middle
East represents a great threat to the country; hence, it has to develop
ways of protecting itself (e.g., with the anti-defense missile). The
small size of the country tends to be a disadvantage since an attack on
it can be launched easily and within a short time.]{.underline}

Another weakness is that, [despite the fact that Israel owns these kinds
of defense systems, it can face some problems frequency interference
connected with the technology and thus the use of multiple defense
systems]{.underline}. This fact may deter the development and use of the
lower level missiles defense systems.134 In addition, this issue may
bring disagreement civilian and military sectors concerning the
allocation of funds for different goals and reasons.

c\. Opportunities

Allied with Jordan and Egypt, Israel can use that opportunity and locate
stage some of its BDM systems in these countries to increase its own
security coverage and thus protect itself from enemies. For example,
Israel can use the Jordan Valley to defend against its enemies easily
even with short-range and medium-range defense missiles. Increasing the
area of the TBMD operations provides alternatives in most missile
interception tests while also ensuring that a larger area is covered for
its ultimate protection.135

The United States funds Israeli research and development of the BDM
system, and it is an opportunity for the country to improve not only its
economic advantage in the region but also its. [The United States has
continuously focused on offering the necessary support to Israel against
enemy threats by supporting it in the development of TBMD]{.underline}.
Of course, this assistance is based on the U.S. interests in the Middle
East.136 Even so, [Israel can take advantage of the increasing research
and development means to boost its security against missile attacks, and
thus fully protect its citizens from all types of missile
attacks.]{.underline}

The war and conflicts inhibit the economic development of Israel as well
as its relationship with Jordan, which, as it is stable, can assist in
peace talks, help soften the conflict between countries in that region,
and create a better environment for the growth. Israel can reach out to
other countries and see if they could design an amicable solution to the
current security problems and reduce armaments in the region.

Israel needs low-level defense systems in populated areas since the Iron
Dome, a high-level defense system, has been created to protect only the
strategic areas. The lowlevel defense systems give the government of
Israel the chance to demonstrate its commitment to the protection of all
its citizens against missile attacks. [Politicians have been using the
missile defense systems to assure the citizens of their firm intention
to safeguard them]{.underline}. Therefore, they should implement their
agendas by creating low-level defense systems to protect populated
areas, which have been and will likely continue to be target for missile
attacks, especially from groups such as Hezbollah.

#### Arms sales increasing -- sustains the DIB 

**Thompson 18** (Loren Thompson, Chief Operating Officer of Lexington
Institute, Apr 20, 2018, \"Trump Drone Decree Signals Arms Exports Are
Now A Key Feature Of U.S. Economic Policy,\" Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/lorenthompson/2018/04/20/trump-drone-decree-signals-arms-exports-are-now-a-key-feature-of-u-s-economic-policy/#b2f560f32a56//KDES).

Donald [Trump is turning out to be the best thing to happen to the
defense industry since Ronald Reagan left town. On Thursday of this
week, the White House released a presidential memorandum loosening the
restrictions on overseas sales of unmanned aerial vehicles, colloquially
known as \"drones.\" Defense companies have been arguing for years that
regulations concerning the export of drones were too burdensome, and
enabled competitors to capture foreign markets.]{.underline}

Clearly, the White House has heard these complaints.

But [the implications]{.underline} of the April 19 memorandum
[are]{.underline} far more [momentous]{.underline}, because [it commits
the federal government to actively facilitating arms sales to overseas
allies and partners. The government has always been a participant in
decisions to export weapons, but now it looks poised to become a
promoter]{.underline}. The memorandum cites several reasons why this is
desirable: [it creates jobs, it reduces the trade deficit, it spurs
innovation, it maintains our military\'s warfighting edge, and it
reduces the need for other countries to seek U.S. \"boots on the
ground.\"]{.underline}

The Obama administration would have agreed in principle with many of
these objectives. In practice, though, [its baroque process for
reviewing proposed arms transfers often impeded the ability of U.S.
defense companies to compete in places like the Persian Gulf, and in the
case of unmanned aerial vehicles, it enabled China to seize a large
share of the global market.]{.underline}

Trump\'s memorandum won\'t open the floodgates to arms sales \--
Congress will still play a critical role in approving major transactions
\-- but [as the new policy is implemented weapons sales to other
countries are nearly certain to increase, and that is good news for the
defense industry. Some companies such as Boeing, General Atomics,
Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Textron are positioned to reap significant
sales gains]{.underline} (I have financial ties of one sort or another
to most of these companies).

But there is more to this story than the loosening of curbs on arms
exports. Military production is getting wrapped into a broader White
House industrial policy aimed at revitalizing the entire U.S.
manufacturing base. The administration is about to release the results
of a year-long investigation into the health of the defense industrial
base, and it has included in its expansive definition of that sector
many basic industries that contribute production inputs to military
items.

To a far greater degree than any previous administration,
[the]{.underline} Trump [White House sees the defense industry as an
integral part of the overall industrial economy and a tool through which
it can bolster the health of struggling sectors such as steel and
aluminum.]{.underline} The traditional view of military contractors in
both Republican and Democratic administrations has been that they are a
unique and separate part of the economy \-- one requiring special
handling \-- but President Trump apparently favors a different approach.

In Trump\'s conception, Washington can get a lot more mileage out of its
defense dollars if it consciously includes economic and trade
considerations in its spending practices. The Pentagon is the world\'s
biggest purchaser of advanced technology and accounts for a significant
share of all domestic manufacturing jobs, so to Trump it is just common
sense that defense and economic policies should be viewed as different
facets of a unified agenda.

The Trump approach may seem novel in an American context, but it is
actually the way that most countries \-- including Russia and China \--
deal with their defense industries. Few nations have the luxury of
segregating their military producers from the rest of the economy, and
making purchases without regard to the potential economic and trade
fallout. So the Trump strategy actually aligns Washington with the way
most of our allies and adversaries think about military production and
arms exports.

Thursday\'s memorandum makes it clear that the U.S. will not be selling
weapons indiscriminately to all comers. Proposed transactions will still
be reviewed to ascertain that they are compatible with U.S. security
objectives. But the amount of time required will be greatly compressed
from what it was, and [the volume of arms exports will likely grow
significantly. So if you thought things couldn\'t get any better for the
U.S. defense industry, guess again. They just did.]{.underline}

#### Israel sales key to sustaining US defense industry

**Badillo 19** Anna Badillo Defense Post, 4-9-2019, \"The US-Israel
'special relationship' subsidizes American military industry and Israeli
colonialism,\"
https://thedefensepost.com/2019/04/09/us-israel-arms-sales-opinion///ALiang

U.S. military loans started arriving in Israel in November 1971, when
the Nixon administration signed a Memorandum of Understanding with
Israel to build up its domestic industrial-arms sector through technical
and manufacturing assistance. Grants started to replace loans in 1974.
[The U.S. government shortly afterwards started to permit Israel to
spend 26% of the annual military grant on purchases in Israel -- a
unique arrangement, since by U.S. law recipient countries must spend all
of their foreign military financing in the U.S.]{.underline} According
to Ajl, "[the Israeli military industry often relies on U.S.
technological inputs, and the U.S. forbids Israel from manufacturing
crucial heavy weaponry, such as fighter jets, in order to maintain
control over Israel]{.underline}." U.S. military grants to Israel were
often quid pro quo, as Israel increasingly took on the work for which
the U.S. could not publicly take responsibility, given popular unease in
the States over aid to fascist dictatorships. As the International
Jewish Anti-Zionist Network noted in their report, Israel's Worldwide
Role in Repression, in the 1970s, Israel armed the brutal military
regime of the Argentinian junta that imposed seven years of state
terrorism on the population. Israel also provided most of the arms that
Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio "Tachito" Somoza used in the last year of
his dictatorship to oppose the revolution, a conflict that killed tens
of thousands of Nicaraguans in the 1970s. By the 2000s, [the Israeli
military-industrial complex had produced an industry capable of
competing in small-arms and high-end security technology on a worldwide
scale.]{.underline} Israel started to export arms that have been refined
through high-technology colonial policing of the Palestinian population,
especially in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In recent years, [Israel
has risen to one of the top 10 arms exporters in the world.]{.underline}
Last May Haaretz reported, "[Israel's defense-related exports in 2017
totalled \$9.2 billion, an all-time record and whooping 40% increase
over 2016 -- when defense-related transactions totaled \$6.5
billion."]{.underline} The Obama administration adjustments to Israel's
military aid package came amidst a shifting geopolitical environment,
both within the U.S. and Israel. There was a shift in original MOU that
would slowly phase out the provisions through which Israel could spend
up to 26% of its funding package within Israel, to Israel spending more
of this funding on the advanced military capabilities that only the
United States can provide -- as much as \$1.2 billion per year,
according to Ajl. In addition, this MOU locked in \$500 million annually
for missile defense.The MOU mandates Israel update its fighter aircraft
fleet, which is a direct investment into the U.S. military-industrial
complex, given that fighter-jet factories are exclusively based in the
United States. Not only does U.S. foreign policy and Israeli-settler
colonialism shape what happens across historic Palestine, it also shapes
what happens across the Middle East region. [The firm establishment of
Israel's military defense industry also provides an excuse to sell
ever-more-sophisticated weapons to other regional U.S. allies,
especially Saudi Arabia. As long as Israel has the latest U.S.
technology, other countries can buy older models, again to the great
profit of the U.S. defense industry. Israel thus is the spark plug for
an entire region-wide weapons bazaar, while also providing such
countries the means to destroy and dismantle even poorer countries like
Yemen.]{.underline} This keeps the entire region aflame, oppressed and
desperate, and thus unlikely to upset hierarchical regional and
international social structures. Ajl suggests that one of reasons the
United States pushed through this MOU before Obama left office is the
rising discontent within the U.S. population over ongoing support for
Israeli colonization of historic Palestine and the surrounding region.
Frida Berrigan, author of Made in the U.S.A.: American Military Aid to
Israel, writes that a major barrier to any shift in American policy
towards Palestine-Israel is "financial pressures from a U.S military
industrial complex accustomed to billions of dollars in sales to Israel
and other Middle Eastern nations locked in a seemingly perpetual arms
race with each other by all buying American and using Foreign Military
Financing (FMF) to pay the bills." [The United States is the primary
source of Israel's far superior arsenal. Israel's dependence on the U.S.
for aid and arms means that the Israeli military relies on spare parts
and technical assistance from the U.S. to maintain optimum performance
in battle. During the Bush administration, from 2001 to 2005, Israel had
actually received more in U.S. military aid than it has in U.S. arms
deliveries. Over this time period, Israel received \$10.5 billion in FMF
-- the Pentagon's biggest military aid program -- and \$6.3 billion in
U.S. arms deliveries. According to Berrigan, the most prominent of those
deals was a \$4.5 billion sale of 102 Lockheed Martin F-16s to
Israel.]{.underline} Unlike other countries, [Israel receives its
Economic Support Funds in one lump sum early in the fiscal year rather
than in four quarterly installments. While other countries primarily
deal with the Department of Defense when arranging to purchase military
hardware from U.S. companies, Israel deals directly with U.S. companies
for the vast majority of its military purchases in the United
States]{.underline}. Other countries have a \$100,000 minimum purchase
amount per contract, but Israel is allowed to purchase military items
for far less, according to Berrigan. Today, Israel has been the
beneficiary of approximately \$125 billion in U.S. aid. An unimaginable
sum, more than any other country since World War II. U.S. aid is
projected to further increase to \$165 billion by the end of the new
10-year package, in 2029, according to Charles D. Freilich, a former
Israeli deputy national security adviser. U.S. aid constitutes some 3%
of Israel's total state budget and about 1% of its GDP, a highly
significant sum. Moreover, U.S. aid constitutes some 20% of the total
defense budget, 40% of the budget of the Israel Defense Forces, and
almost the entire procurement budget, according to Freilich. [Israel's
dependence on the U.S. is not limited to financial aid and weapons
sales. According to Freilich, the U.S. provides technologies for the
development of unique weapons systems that Israel needs, such as the
Iron Dome and the Arrow rocket and missile defense systems.]{.underline}
It mans the radar deployed in Israel, which is linked to the global
American satellite system. Fredilich writes, "There is simply no
alternative to American weapons, and our dependence on the United States
is almost complete; the bitter truth is that without the United States,
the IDF would be an empty shell[." The United States is Israel's largest
trading partner, at least partially due to their bilateral free trade
agreement, the first the United States signed with any
country.]{.underline} The U.S.-Israel special relationship is rooted in
preferential arms trade agreements as a way to subsidize the U.S.
military industry and reinforce support for Israeli colonialism. This
special relationship is locked into an arms trade cycle where both the
Israeli and American elite class benefits, at the expense of the
indigenous population. The U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over
occupied territories provides a boost for Israeli colonialism. We must
ask ourselves, "If Trump has consented to Israeli illegal seizure of the
Golan Heights and Jerusalem, why not also the West Bank?" Prime Minister
Netanyahu has vowed to annex Israeli settlements in the West Bank if he
is re-elected, which will likely be considered as the final blow to the
so called possibility of a two-state solution. The Trump administration
is expected to announce his "ultimate deal" following the Israeli
elections and after a new government is formed. It is only a matter of
time till the Trump administration decides to follow suit and recognize
Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank, which will drive the final nail
into the coffin of the Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations and
solidify Israeli apartheid.

#### The DIB is key to economic innovations -- spin-off tech

[Zur, 19]{.underline} Zur, Christian. executive director for procurement
policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and serves as council executive

"Amid budget talks, remember that America's defense-industrial base is
indispensable." June 27, 19.
https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/06/27/amid-budget-talks-remember-that-americas-defense-industrial-base-is-indispensable/

As Congress takes up the annual defense budget, it is worth
acknowledging the comfort and quality of life to which we are accustomed
owes its legacy in no small part to the collaborative force of the
[greatest public-private partnership in American history: the
defense-industrial base]{.underline}.

Those who would downplay this partnership may not fully grasp the extent
to which the U.S. has benefited immeasurably beyond its immediate
national security needs. From safe and reliable commercial aviation, to
cancer research and treatment, to the internet itself, the [innovation
that has supported our military]{.underline} over the decades have
[simultaneously enhanced the lives of all Americans]{.underline}.

The advantages accrued by the nation's investment in technology have not
always been readily apparent, and the relationship has not always been
easy or straightforward. The U.S. military often has to create an
industrial capability where once there was none.

Fortunately, the DNA of the [commercial technology sector is directly
intertwined into our]{.underline} robust and diverse [defense-industrial
base.]{.underline} Influencing current innovation ranging from satellite
telecommunication to hybrid vehicles, Silicon Valley itself and
countless university labs owe their founding to defense investment
grants and contracts.

Beyond the qualitative measures of these standout technologies, the
[defense-industrial base supports]{.underline} one of the [largest
high-skill and high-wage workforces in the nation.]{.underline} Indeed,
the [U.S. defense]{.underline} and aerospace industry [employs 2.4
million workers]{.underline} with an average salary 44 percent above the
national average.

Despite antiquated procurement practices imposed by Congress and
successive administrations, today's industrial base is flexible and
resilient and able to meet every U.S. military requirement without fail.
By every measure, that is success.

But as the late Sen. John McCain cautioned at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce in 2015, global research and development is more than twice
that of the United States, and Chinese R&D levels are projected to
surpass the United States by 2022.

As recently noted in the context of U.S. space dominance being under
challenge by foreign competitors, we must unharness American ingenuity
and allow industry to develop and deploy innovation at increasing speed
and efficiency.

No different than other industrial sectors, defense companies
reorganized and internally reformed over the past few decades. Today,
America's top defense suppliers zealously manage their own compliance
and contract performance, rather than relying on government procurement
officers to oversee product development milestones and service delivery.

As legislative and executive branch policymakers resolve budget
differences over the coming months, it is worth recognizing the broad
and diffused impact of such deliberations over the years. [From the
convenience of weather data and digital photography to omnipresent
mobile communications, the innovation of our defense-industrial base has
delivered for all Americans.]{.underline}

#### Econ decline causes global wars 

**Liu 18** Qian Liu, China-based economist. "From economic crisis to
World War III." Project Syndicate. 11/8/2018.
<https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-crisis-military-conflict-or-structural-reform-by-qian-liu-2018-11>

The next economic crisis is closer than you think. But what you should
really worry about is what comes after: [in the **current social,
political, and technological landscape**, a **prolonged economic
crisis**, combined with rising income inequality, could]{.underline}
well **[escalate into a major global military conflict]{.underline}**.

[The]{.underline} 20[08]{.underline}-09 global financial [crisis almost
bankrupted governments and caused systemic collapse]{.underline}.
[Policymakers managed to pull the global economy back]{.underline} from
the brink, [using massive monetary stimulus, including]{.underline}
**[q]{.underline}**uantitative **[e]{.underline}**asing
[and]{.underline} near-[zero]{.underline} ([or even
negative]{.underline}) interest [rates]{.underline}.

But monetary stimulus is like an adrenaline shot to jump-start an
arrested heart; it can revive the patient, but it does nothing to cure
the disease. Treating a sick economy requires structural reforms, which
can cover everything from financial and labour markets to tax systems,
fertility patterns, and education policies.

Policymakers have utterly failed to pursue such reforms, despite
promising to do so. Instead, they have remained preoccupied with
politics. From Italy to Germany, forming and sustaining governments now
seems to take more time than actual governing. Greece, for example, has
relied on money from international creditors to keep its head (barely)
above water, rather than genuinely reforming its pension system or
improving its business environment.

The lack of structural reform has meant that the unprecedented excess
liquidity that central banks injected into their economies was not
allocated to its most efficient uses. Instead, it raised global asset
prices to levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008.

In the United States, housing prices are now 8% higher than they were at
the peak of the property bubble in 2006, according to the property
website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which measures
whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is now higher
than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great Depression in
1929.

As monetary tightening reveals the vulnerabilities in the real economy,
the collapse of asset-price bubbles will trigger another economic crisis
-- one that could be even more severe than the last, because we have
built up a tolerance to our strongest macroeconomic medications. A
decade of regular adrenaline shots, in the form of ultra-low interest
rates and unconventional monetary policies, has severely depleted their
power to stabilise and stimulate the economy.

If history is any guide, [the consequences of this mistake could extend
far beyond the economy]{.underline}. [According to
Harvard's]{.underline} [Benjamin Friedman, **prolonged periods of
economic distress** have been characterised]{.underline} also [by public
**antipathy toward minority groups or foreign countries** -- attitudes
that can help to **fuel unrest**]{.underline},
**[terrorism]{.underline}**, [or even]{.underline}
**[war]{.underline}**.

For example, [during the Great Depression]{.underline}, US President
Herbert [Hoover signed]{.underline} the 1930
**[Smoot-Hawley]{.underline}** Tariff Act, intended to protect American
workers and farmers from foreign competition. In the subsequent five
years, global trade shrank by two-thirds. [Within a decade, **World War
II** had begun]{.underline}.

To be sure, WWII, like World War I, was caused by a multitude of
factors; there is no standard path to war. But there is reason to
believe that high levels of inequality can play a significant role in
stoking conflict.

[According to research by]{.underline} the economist Thomas
[**Piketty**, a spike in income inequality is often followed by a
**great crisis**]{.underline}. Income inequality then declines for a
while, before rising again, until a new peak -- and a new disaster.
Though causality has yet to be proven, given the limited number of data
points, this correlation should not be taken lightly, especially with
wealth and income inequality at historically high levels.

This is all the more worrying in view of the numerous other factors
stoking social unrest and diplomatic tension, including technological
disruption, a record-breaking migration crisis, anxiety over
globalisation, political polarisation, and rising nationalism. All are
symptoms of failed policies that could turn out to be trigger points for
a future crisis.

Voters have good reason to be frustrated, but the [emotionally appealing
**populists**]{.underline} to whom they are increasingly giving their
support are offering ill-advised solutions that [will **only make
matters worse**]{.underline}. For example, [despite the world's
unprecedented interconnectedness, **multilateralism is increasingly
being eschewed**]{.underline}, as countries -- most notably, Donald J.
[Trump's US -- pursue unilateral, isolationist policies]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [**proxy wars** are **raging in Syria and
Yemen**]{.underline}.

Against this background, [we must take seriously the possibility that
the **next economic crisis could lead to a large-scale military
confrontation**]{.underline}. By the logic of the political scientist
Samuel Huntington, considering such a scenario could help us avoid it
because it would force us to take action. In this case, the key will be
for policymakers to pursue the structural reforms that they have long
promised while replacing finger-pointing and antagonism with a sensible
and respectful global dialogue. The alternative may well be global
conflagration.

[Defense-Industrial Cooperation]{.underline} In recent decades,
**[Israel has emerged as a major defense industrial
playe]{.underline}**r. In 2010, Israel exported more than [\$7 billion
in arms, making it one of the four largest arms exporters in the
world]{.underline}. The close ties that have emerged between the
defense-industrial establishments of Israel and the United States during
this time have yielded important benefits for both.68 Israel and the
United States have long [cooperated in the modification and development
of U.S. weapons systems,]{.underline} with Israel providing feedback to
U.S. manufacturers regarding the performance of their weapons in combat,
resulting in numerous modifications to these systems that have benefited
both militaries.69 Likewise, the [success of U.S. arms in Israeli
service, such as the]{.underline} F-4 [Phantom]{.underline}, F-16
Falcon, and F-15 Eagle [fighters, has contributed to]{.underline} their
[worldwide commercial success]{.underline}.70 Israel benefits greatly
from [U.S. military assistance]{.underline}, although, as previously
noted, some [75 percent of the assistance is spent in the United
States.]{.underline} However, Israel's **[defense industries have unique
attributes that benefit U.S. defense contractors]{.underline}** that
partner with them. These include the close [cooperation between military
operators]{.underline} and those involved in weapons [R&D]{.underline},
which ensures that new weapons are tailored to the needs of the former,
[and the speed with which Israel fields new systems.]{.underline} For
instance[, the Iron Dome]{.underline} rocket-defense system (which is
being marketed jointly by Raytheon and Rafael) was fielded in less than
four years. Moreover, in the past decade, Israel has emerged as a major
supplier of defense articles to the U.S. military, with **[sales growing
from \$300 million to \$1.5 billion annually]{.underline}** (about 20
percent of Israel's total arms exports).71 In many cases, [Israeli firms
have partnered with American companies to enhance the prospects of sales
to the U.S. military]{.underline} and to third countries, enabling
**[U.S. firms to benefit from Israeli R&D and combat]{.underline}**
experience while [preserving or creating U.S. jobs.]{.underline} The
numerous Israeli-origin defense articles used by the U.S. military
include battlefield ISR systems, UAVs, airborne targeting pods,
precision munitions, helmetmounted sights, armored bulldozer kits, armor
used on more than 15,000 fighting vehicles (MRAPs, Bradley IFVs, M1
tanks, and AAV-7 and Stryker AFVs), and naval point-defense systems.

[The transformation of US-Israel relations from a one-way-street to a
mutually-beneficial two-way-street, has occurred despite the tactical,
short-term US-Israel disagreements over]{.underline} the Arab-Israeli
conflict and [the Palestinian issue]{.underline}. The significant
compatibility between the [strategic, long-term regional and global
challenges and threats facing both nations has transcended such
disagreements.]{.underline}

In 2018, [Israel's Air Force features the US-developed and manufactured
F-35 stealth fighter, serving as a battle-tested laboratory for the US
Air Force]{.underline} and the plane's manufacturer (Lockheed Martin),
as it has been for the manufacturers of the F-15, F-16, [missiles and
missile launchers, tanks, armed personnel carriers and hundreds of
additional US military systems. Israel has shared with the US lessons
learned by Israeli pilots]{.underline}, who fly under a do-or-die state
of mind[. This has helped stretch the performance of the US-made
aircraft beyond conventional standards]{.underline}. Such lessons [have
enhanced the capabilities of the US Air Force and the quality of the
next generation of the F-35]{.underline}, [**saving the manufacturer
many years of research and development,** enhancing US competitiveness
in the global market, increasing US exports and expanding US
employment.]{.underline} In other words, [the annual transfer of \$3.8
billion to Israel]{.underline} (which funds the acquisition of US
military systems) is not "foreign aid" to -- [but a highly profitable
investment in -- Israel.]{.underline}

The Middle East accounts for around 5 percent of global GDP. It is
growing by about 5 percent annually and accounts for about 5 percent of
U.S. exports. Arab cash purchases and generous taxpayer funding of arms
transfers to [Israel play a vital role in keeping production lines open
and sustaining the U.S. defense industrial base. Including military
goods and services, the United States has a substantial but declining
share of the region's imports --- about one-fourth of them.]{.underline}
By way of comparison, China's share is nearly two-fifths and India's
one-fifth, almost all non military in nature. The Middle East is [a
significant market for American engineering, educational, and consulting
services.]{.underline} Otherwise, as long as Arab oil producers'
currencies remain linked to the dollar, the region's markets cannot be
said to be of more than marginal importance to the U.S. export economy.

# T -- FMS and DCS =/= FMF

## 1nc -- FMF

#### interpretation and violation -- FMS and DCS is distinct from Israeli FMF

**NDIA no date** (The National Defense Industrial Association is an
association for the United States government and the defense industry,
<http://www.ndia.org/policy/international/fms-vs-dcs>, "Foreign Military
Sales vs Direct Commercial Sales" -- BIB)

[FMS Process]{.underline}

[FMS -- an acquisition program administered through]{.underline} the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency ([DSCA]{.underline}), with final
approval by the State Department -- supports security cooperation
between the U.S. and its allies. While [the U.S. government contracts
out to the defense industry on a competitive or sole-source basis, it
may also sell directly from its own stockpiles]{.underline}. When buying
directly from the government's stockpiles, foreign customers will have
more leverage in the unit price of a defense system -- as these same
systems are also acquired by the U.S. military and defense agencies.

**[For qualified FMS customers, the U.S. Congress provides funding
through foreign military financing (FMF]{.underline}**). [Authorized by
the State Department]{.underline}, and administered through DSCA, FMF
funding is a non-repayable loan legally granted to strategic countries
-- **[most notably Israel]{.underline}**, Egypt, Afghanistan, and Iraq.
While FMS cases must have departmental approval, they are exempt from
the export licensing process.

Foreign customers view the FMS process as more transparent, reliable,
and secure. The U.S. government takes on more of the contractual risk
than the customer in the short run, and supports the sustainment of the
defense system in the long run. A September 2016 White House approval of
the sale of fighter jets to the Middle East illustrates the impact that
FMS has on the U.S. economy, while concurrently serving U.S. national
security interests.

[DCS Process]{.underline}

DCS is regarded as a more flexible process, as t[he purchaser consults
directly with industry about specific products and services it
need]{.underline}s. Foreign customers leverage more negotiating power
regarding the type of contract (fixed price or firm fixed price), how
the contract is written, final delivery requirements, and methods of
payment. However, they must carry more risk and administrative burdens.
DCS has the added benefit of giving customers options to purchase more
non-standard systems that are mission specific, and designed to tackle
readiness challenges. In these cases, the Pentagon does not support
these types of mission requirements in their stockpiles, or in their
annual budget.

Qualifying for an export license through DCS is based on how a product
or service [is categorized. The State Department's Directorate of
Defense Trade Controls]{.underline} (DDTC) executes authority in issuing
export licenses to all defense related products and services on the U.S.
Munitions List (USML), pursuant to the International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR). The Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and
Security (BIS) grants export licenses to more commercial and "dual-use"
defense products and services on the Commerce Control List (CCL),
pursuant to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR).

Like the FMS program, DCS advances interoperability between the U.S
military and its allies. Furthermore, **[foreign countries use FMF
funding to purchase U.S. defense products and systems through both the
FMS program and, on occasion, the DCS process.]{.underline}**

#### Prefer it:

#### Limits & Ground: aff expands the topic to include all types of military aid -- that lets affs skirt the topic and get away with anything as long as arms are incorporated somewhere

**[FMF vs. FMS]{.underline}**

Clients often ask me about [the difference between Foreign Military
Financing and Foreign Military Sales]{.underline}. In reality, FMF and
FMS **[aren't directly comparable.]{.underline}** [FMF provides funding
for defense purchases, while FMS is the program for managing the sale
and transfer of military items]{.underline}. Sales funded by FMF are
almost always processed through the FMS program. (Only a few countries
have exceptions to use [FMF funds for Direct Commercial
Sales]{.underline}.) The FMS program, on the other hand, may be used for
FMF-financed sales, or for sales paid for by the foreign customer.

U.S. aerospace and defense exports (1) sustain a domestic workforce in
the manufacturing sector, (2) support national security programs through
the [foreign military sales (FMS) and direct commercial sales (DCS)
processes]{.underline}, and (3) narrow the U.S. trade deficit gap. In
2016 alone, aerospace and defense exports reduced the overall deficit by
\$80-90 billion dollars.
