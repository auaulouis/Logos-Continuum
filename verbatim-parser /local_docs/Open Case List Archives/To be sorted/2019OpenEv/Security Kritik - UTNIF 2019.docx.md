#### **Limiting arms sales is a ruse of governmentality to enable the smooth functioning of wider networks of racism, colonial order, and imperial power. The aff's naïvely optimistic embrace of tactical disarmament without structural demilitarization sustains liberal militarism**

This article has offered [a more complete understanding of the dynamics
of arms trade regulation]{.underline} in the late nineteenth century. In
this concluding section, I also draw on this understanding to [**provide
insights into** current **debates about** norms, **arms regulation, and
arms control as governmentality**. The 1890 Brussels Act can be
understood as the first matryoshka doll of arms trade governance---a
discrete initiative that]{.underline}, in this case, [aimed to regulate
the import of a specified class of weapons into a specified area of
Africa. From the perspective of proponents, the act was the outcome of a
grand humanitarian campaign to restrict the arms (and liquor) trade to
Africa]{.underline}. Indeed, it can be understood, in part, as an effort
to graft a regulatory arms trade norm onto an established and
constitutive anti-slavery norm. [At the same time, policymakers were
also motivated by a more prosaic concern to maintain qualitative
military superiority over colonial subjects in Africa. Nevertheless,
**judged in isolation**, the campaign for the Brussels Act can be
understood as a relatively successful initiative that managed to merge
the requirements of colonial order with a particularly paternalist and
orientalist humanitarianism]{.underline}. Moreover, with the exception
of the arms traffic to Abyssinia and Somalia, implementation of the act
was more extensive than has generally been acknowledged. [However, the
Brussels Act represented **just one element in a larger network of
regulation** aimed at restricting the supply of arms to colonial
subjects in all the spaces of empire. This constituted the second
Matryoshka doll of arms trade governance. Thus, rather than being an era
of free trade in arms, the period was actually characterized by a dual
regime of regulation: the operation of a peacetime liberal export norm
for transfers from imperial metropoles combined with widespread efforts
to manage arms flows into, within, and between the spaces of
empire]{.underline} (using post-export blockades, import controls,
internal regulations, and restrictions on transfers between colonial
spaces). [This contrasts with the contemporary **emphasis on producer
export controls** as a primary (if not exclusive) vehicle for managing
the global trade in conventional arms. When located in this broader
network of prohibitory regulation, the humanitarian underpinnings of the
Brussels Act **are** revealed to be **far less significant than the
concerns about** the **maintenance of colonial order and** qualitative
military advantage for **imperial power**]{.underline}s. Of course, [the
operation of a free trade in arms philosophy combined with competition
for colonies, markets, and influence amongst imperial powers is
generally deemed to have trumped substantive efforts at limiting arms
flows. However, practices of proscription and permission were both part
of the attempt to delineate who could legitimately use which gradations
of weapons according to where they were located in the triple
hierarchies of civilization, loyalty, and utility to
empire]{.underline}. This is not to deny that local actors constantly
engaged in strategies of evasion or that imperial policies were
perennially reversed or amended. Indeed, both permissive and
proscriptive arms trade norms were the site of recurring contestation
that played out in the form of competing appeals to transnational
constitutive norms such as sovereignty, free trade, colonialism, and the
standard of civilization. [Nevertheless, the oscillations in policy this
produced are better understood less as a failure of prohibition and more
as **constituting the fluid cartography of regulation that** was (and
**is) a defining feature of arms control as
governmentality**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the process of **serially
reinventing the border between legitimate and illegitimate ownership**
of, and trade in, the means of violence represented an important
political project in its own right, irrespective of the actual material
impact on arms flows]{.underline}. Indeed, [the understanding of arms
trade governance as a Sisyphean endeavor was (and remains) central to
the legitimizing politics of arms control as governmentality;
sanctifying the performative of regulatory and institutional refinement,
an á la carte approach to normative frameworks (e.g. humanitarianism,
free trade, military necessity) and their application to specific arms
trade policy questions]{.underline}. Nevertheless, by the early 1900s
colonial powers had developed fairly extensive mechanisms of regulation
that, in general, were probably as effective as the mechanisms of
contemporary arms trade regulation heralded by optimists as signaling a
shift to a novel form of global arms governance. [What insights, then,
can we draw into contemporary debates in the literature on post-Cold War
arms trade regulation? First, the simplistic claim that contemporary HAC
initiatives, including those on small arms, are "novel" just does not
stand up to historical analysis. This bears repeating time and time
again given the frequency with which the former claim is recycled. What
is more useful, therefore, is to reflect on the ways in which
contemporary HAC is or is **not novel compared** to antecedents such as
the Brussels Act and to use this reflection as the basis for evaluating
current debates in the literature on HAC]{.underline}. There are some
notable differences. The Brussels Act was concerned with restricting
what were then considered new, modern, and technologically cutting-edge
firearms, whereas contemporary small arms are generally viewed as a
mature technology. Even more notably, the overt racism that
characterized the discursive landscape of nineteenth-century HAC has
largely disappeared. Similarly, a feature of contemporary transnational
initiatives on small arms, landmines, and the ATT has been the way these
initiatives have been actively promoted by key states and civil society
organizations from the Global South (Efrat 2012, 66; Bromley, Cooper,
and Holtom 2012, 1039). The global architecture of small arms regulation
also includes regional agreements, such as the ECOWAS moratorium on
SALW, that are composed solely of states from the Global South. [This is
certainly indicative of changes in power relations between North and
South.]{.underline} Nevertheless, northern [NGOs remain the primary
gatekeepers determining what issues (e.g., landmines as opposed to
thermobaric weapons) become the focus of civil society
campaigns]{.underline} (Carpenter 2014). Northern actors have also been
the largest funders of HAC campaigns on small arms, landmines, and
cluster munitions, whilst northern NGOs have been the largest recipients
of this funding (Stavrianakis 2011, 208; O'Dwyer 2014). Moreover, whilst
HAC campaigns are certainly framed as expressions of cosmopolitan
solidarism, they have also drawn on largely uninterrogated standard of
civilization norms and are not immune to the recycling of orientalist
assumptions about the legitimacy and motivations of different suppliers,
recipients, and users of the instruments of violence (Stavrianakis 2011;
Mathur 2014). Furthermore, there have been notable moves to liberalize
arms exports, particularly with respect to intra-Western transfers
(Cooper 2011, 147--49). [This indicates the need to **abandon the
uncritical assumption of the optimists** that the merging of arms
control and humanitarianism must, by definition, be both positive and
transformative]{.underline}. As demonstrated here, the
**[merging]{.underline}** of **[the two is not]{.underline}**
necessarily **[incompatible with colonialism, racism, and imperial
violence]{.underline}**. Moreover, both Brussels and the broader
operation of [arms control as governmentality illustrate
how]{.underline} HAC [initiatives may not represent a victory for "good
norms" over "bad norms" but the way in which **such initiatives are
situated within the regulatory logics produced by both**.]{.underline}
Indeed, [victories for HAC may **neither challenge nor reconstitute
hegemonic practices of security and economy**. Instead, they may be
achieved because apparently disparate and divergent normative frameworks
constitute historically contingent norm hierarchies that produce the
conditions of possibility for the emergence of particular modes of arms
trade governance and their associated logics of permission and
restraint. Certainly, arms trade regulation in the age of empire,
including its humanitarian variants, **never challenged the logic of
liberal militarism and in many respects** was **harnessed** to
**it**]{.underline}. [The Brussels Act, in particular, represented an
early example of the "devil's bargain" in which humanitarian restraint
was achieved at the expense of legitimizing the arms, forms of violence,
and ways of war practiced by hegemonic powers]{.underline}. There are
similarities here with many contemporary HAC campaigns, which have been
equally focused on controlling violence in the peripheries. Such
campaigns have also been characterized by the way in which key groups
such as the ICRC have sought to distance themselves from disarmament
activists and antimilitarism to make HAC agendas more palatable to
policymakers (Carpenter 2014, 105 and 117). [This indicates the need for
caution in assuming that successive limited humanitarian initiatives can
change the dominant logics of militarism whilst also extracting a
critique of militarism from those same initiatives.]{.underline} Of
course, the recent success of the humanitarian campaign to ban nuclear
weapons might suggest a shift in HAC towards a more effective merging of
humanitarianism and antimilitarism. Even here, however, it is notable
that campaigners have attempted to retain the distinction between
legitimate and illegitimate weapons, and the distinction between
disarmament as an overarching goal and strategy and disarmament as a
weapons-specific tactic (Fihn 2017; UNIDIR 2017, 10). Moreover, it is
notable that nuclear weapon states have neither signed the ban treaty
nor abandoned expensive nuclear modernization programs (Korb 2017).
Thus, [both Brussels and contemporary HAC initiatives illustrate the
"limits of possibility" inherent in pursuing the **empty** **promise of
tactical** humanitarian "**disarmament" without strategic
demilitarization.** It is worth noting in this context that in
historical terms, the Brussels Act and the broader range of initiatives
to manage arms flows in the spaces of Empire were essentially
transitory---they **did not produce a lasting change in arms trade norms
or in the international system**]{.underline}. In part at least, this
was because prohibitory arms trade norms emerged as elements in the
normative superstructure of the era rather than as constitutive norms in
their own right. At the same time, it was also the case that from the
1930s onwards, changes in the substance of transnational constitutive
norms pertaining to sovereignty, security, economy, and colonialism
created the permissive conditions for a new set of regulatory arms trade
norms to emerge through new processes of grafting and counter-grafting.
There were, of course, elements of earlier approaches in the use of arms
supplies to "the friendlies" in the wars of decolonization and
anticommunism. More generally, however, arms trade regulation in the
Cold War was characterized more by a sovereign approach to arms control
that emphasized the creation and expansion of peacetime national export
licensing systems and the use of regulation to achieve security between
states. Arms trade norms were ultimately at the mercy of these far
larger shifts in foundational constitutive norms. [All this should
prompt due modesty on the part of the optimists heralding the normative
transformations supposedly wrought by HAC initiatives]{.underline} such
as those on small arms. [This article also highlights the need for a
more thoroughgoing **genealogical approach** to the histories of both
HAC and arms trade regulation (governmental and sovereign). This is more
obviously the domain of the critical school of thinking on arms trade
regulation. In the case of the optimists, both the evident flaws of
humanitarian arms trade regulation in the late nineteenth century and
its essentially transient nature demonstrate why they need to think more
historically about the relationship between humanitarianism and arms
regulation. Indeed, despite the differences between nineteenth- and
twenty-first-century HAC, they have yet to convincingly demonstrate why
things might turn out differently this time around.]{.underline}

#### The aff perpetuates discourse of the imagined threatening identity of China leading to an American national identity of neorealist and neoliberal dominance while legitimizing US security policy. 

**Turner 2013** (Oliver, lecturer of International Relations @
University of Edinburgh, "\'Threatening\' China and US security: the
international politics of identity," Cambridge University Press, 39:4,
903-924)

What protagonists of [both sides of the argument
demonstrate]{.underline} in equal measure, however, is [the tendency to
assume that a single physical reality about China]{.underline} can
[be]{.underline} [determined]{.underline}. [This aim of classifying
China as a threat]{.underline} (or indeed a non-threat) [is a legacy of
the **historical dominance** within IR of the]{.underline} overtly
positivist [neorealist and neoliberal]{.underline} schools.8 Positivist
approaches to the discipline rely upon testable theory and empirical
analysis with the expectation that the world can be definitively under-
stood. The traditional influence of these approaches has precluded a
more wide- spread appreciation of how, in fact, a single authoritative
understanding about China is unachievable. The inherent contestability
and subjectivity of judgments about that country was once noted by John
King Fairbank who argued that '\[a\]t any given time the ''truth'' about
China is in our heads'.9 From this understanding [the
existence]{.underline} (or absence) [of a China threat cannot be
satisfactorily explained with reference to material forces alone. The
'threat']{.underline} described by Director Clapper [can never be
dispassionately observed through assessments of an external world, as he
seemingly claimed to be able to do.]{.underline} The purpose of this
article is not to speculate as to whether China 'is' or 'is not' a
threat to the United States. It does not concern itself with China's
nuclear arsenal nor dispute the existence and expansion of its
capabilities, or the possibility of there being a cause of future
violence. It argues that while the material realities of China are
important, the nature and extent of their importance is, and has always
been, regulated by ideas. Of course, the understanding that
international affairs are guided by more than the distribution of state
capabilities is not original; it has long been a primary contestation of
the 'critical', or post-positivist, [IR movement that the world is
mutually constitutive of material and ideational forces]{.underline}.10
Moreover, authors including Evelyn Goh emphasise the centrality of ideas
within Sino-US relations and to the formulation of US China policy at
key moments.11 Chengxin Pan specifically [examines the China 'threat' as
a discursive construction and its importance to Washington's relations
with Beijing]{.underline}.12 Beyond these important works
[the]{.underline} discipline remains relatively quiet on the salience of
[ideational forces in producing a fantasised China 'threat' and in
enabling US policies in response]{.underline}.13 It also broadly fails
to explain how those policies them- selves reinforce the understandings
which make them possible in the first place. This is the arena of
enquiry towards which the article is directed. It contributes to a small
but growing literature which challenges the contours of the modern day
China Threat Theory, exposing it as fundamentally flawed and even
potentially dangerous. It does this by demonstrating that, in many
respects, [today's China 'threat' to US security conforms to those which
have emerged before.]{.underline} It shows how, across the duration of
Sino-US relations, [China 'threats' have]{.underline} always
[emerged]{.underline} in part [from **representation and
interpretation**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} thus [how fears about
that country]{.underline} today [continue to be manufactured and
engineered in a way not unique from those of the]{.underline} (sometimes
distant) [past]{.underline}. In late 2011 the Obama administration
shifted its foreign policy focus from Afghanistan and Iraq to the Asia
Pacific.14 To a significant extent this 'pivot', as it is commonly
described, is motivated by the growth of China. Accordingly, as
increasing concentrations of US political, economic, and military
recourses are diverted to the Asian region, American perceptions of
China and their significance to the enactment of Washington's foreign
policies there have once more become increasingly pertinent. The first
part of the article has two purposes. First, it explicates how it can be
argued that [the China 'threat' to US security is a subjective
representation of American society]{.underline}. It is explained that
while the 'dangers' have an undeniable material base, [China's
capabilities are **attributed ideas** which produce a **threatening
identity** regardless of Beijing's intentions]{.underline}. Second, it
examines the significance of American representations to US China
policy. It is asserted that particular [discourses have always made true
a threatening China and enabled and legitimised policy performances in
response]{.underline}. It is also argued that [those
performances]{.underline} themselves have [reaffirmed the identities of
both China and the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. As such, it is shown that [US China policies
function to protect the]{.underline} (equally [imagined and socially
constructed]{.underline}) [American identity from which the 'threat' is
produced]{.underline}. The second part of the article applies these
arguments to three case studies: the mid-to-late nineteenth century when
an influx of Chinese immigrants entered the United States; the early
Cold War period following the establishment of the People's Republic of
China (PRC); and the modern day period when a 'rising' China is
increasingly powerful and influential. These are the temporal moments at
which ['dangers' from China to American security have been interpreted
as the most immediate and acute.]{.underline} The article concludes with
an overview of the findings and their implications for our
understandings of, and potential approaches towards, the modern day
China 'threat' to the United States. Imagining China: the construction
of threat and political possibility In his analysis of the China Threat
Theory [Chengxin Pan argues]{.underline} that [the 'threat' is an
imagined construction of American observers]{.underline}.15 [Pan does
not deny the importance of the PRC's capabilities but asserts that they
appear threatening from understandings about the United States
itself]{.underline}. '\[T\]here is no such thing as ''Chinese reality''
that can automatically speak for itself', Pan argues.
'\[[T]{.underline}\][o fully understand the US ''China
threat'']{.underline} argument, [it is essential to recognize its
autobiographical nature']{.underline}.16 The [geographical]{.underline}
territory of [China]{.underline}, then, [is not separate
from]{.underline} or external to, [American representations]{.underline}
of it. [Rather]{.underline}, [it is actively constitutive of those
representations]{.underline}.17 [The analysis which]{.underline} follows
[demonstrates]{.underline} that [China 'threats' to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [have]{.underline} to some
extent always [been]{.underline} established and **[perpetuated through
representation and discourse]{.underline}**. Michel Foucault described
discourse as 'the general domain of all statements', constituting either
a group of individual statements or a regulated practice which accounts
for a number of statements.18 [American discourse of China
can]{.underline} therefore be [manifest]{.underline} as disparate and
single [statements about that country or as collectives of related
statements such as the China Threat Theory]{.underline}. Ultimately,
American representations of China are discursive constructions of truths
or realities about its existence. The article draws in part from the
work of David Campbell who suggests that dangers in the international
realm are invariably threats to understandings about the self. ['The
mere existence of an alternative mode of being]{.underline}', argues
Campbell, 'the presence of which [exemplifies that different identities
are possible]{.underline} \... [is sometimes enough to produce the
understanding of a threat]{.underline}.'19 As a result, interpretations
of global danger can be traced to the processes by which states are made
foreign from one another through discourses of separation and
difference.20 In this analysis it is demonstrated that particular
American discourses have historically made the US foreign from China.
Case study one for example demonstrates that nineteenth- century racial
discourses of non-white immigrant Chinese separated China from a United
States largely defined by its presumed Caucasian foundations. In case
study two we see that Cold War ideological discourses of communism
distanced the PRC from the democratic-capitalist US. These types of
discourses are shown to have constituted a 'specific sort of boundary
producing political performance'.21 [Across the history of Sino-US
relations]{.underline} then [when 'dangers' from China]{.underline} have
[emerged]{.underline}, **[they have]{.underline}** always **[been
perceived through the lens of American identity]{.underline}**. [In
consequence, they have]{.underline} always [existed as dangers to that
identity]{.underline}. In this analysis it is argued that a key purpose
of depicting China as a threat has been to protect components of
American identity (primarily racial and ideological) deemed most
fundamental to its being. As such, [representations of a threatening
China have most commonly]{.underline} been advanced by, and [served the
interests of]{.underline}, those who support [actions to defend that
identity]{.underline}. The case study analyses which follow reveal that
this has included politicians and policymaking circles, such as those
within the administration of President Harry Truman which implemented
the Cold War containment of the PRC. It also exposes the complicity of
other societal individuals and institutions including elements of the
late nineteenth-century American media which supported restrictions
against Chinese immigration to the western United States.

#### This investment in securitization sustains an affective economy of perpetual preemptive warfare 

**Massumi 14** (Brian Massumi, professor in the Communication Department
of the University of Montreal, 2013-2014, "The Remains of the Day," *On
Violence* Volume 1, modified)

To help answer our questions, [preemption can\'t be thought of as simply
a doctrine. Doctrines change as political actors and institutions turn
over]{.underline}. Preemption was a doctrine -- in the aftermath of
9-11, it became the stated war doctrine of the George W Bush
administration. [But as **a formative historical force with a power to
regather itself** and follow its own momentum, it overflowed the Bush
administration and flowed into the Obama administration, and will likely
flow beyond it.]{.underline} In addition, [it can be argued that it
overflowed the borders of the United States, **going
global**]{.underline}.

[Preemption in this sense is a tendency that **cannot be reduced to a
time- and place-specific doctrine**. Tendencies are
**self-propagating**]{.underline}. They have a power to repeat their
operations in different times and places. Doctrines must be applied.
**[Tendencies are self-applying. They are self-driving]{.underline}**.
This makes them a force to be contended within their own right

[The question, then, is how preemption constitutes a self-driving
tendency that has to be construed as a force of history passing through
shifts in doctrine and changes in casts of characters.]{.underline}

We\'ll start from the way preemption was formulated as a doctrine by
George W Bush in response to the 9-11 attacks \-- and then consider how
what was encapsulated in that doctrine took on a momentum of its own.

This is the doctrine, Bush\'s own words: \"If we wait for threats to
fully materialize, we will have waited too long. **[We must take the
battle to the enemy]{.underline}**, disrupt his plans and confront the
worst threats before they emerge. In the world we have entered, **[the
only path to safety is the path to action.\"]{.underline}**

Now some might actually see this as an example of \"the more things
change, the more they stay the same,\" because the right to preemptive
attack has been a part of the practice of war for as long as there have
been wars, and is a part of classical war theory and the law of war.
However, [in the past, preemptive attack was considered justified in
response to \"a clear and present danger]{.underline}.\" **[the Bush
doctrine changed danger to threat]{.underline}**.

[The first thing this does is **shift the emphasis to the affective
register**]{.underline}. A clear and present danger is observable and in
principle objectively verifiable, whereas **[a threat only has to be
felt to be.]{.underline}** [It has a visceral reality that is
**self-confirming**]{.underline}. **[If you feel threatened, you
are]{.underline}** -- end of story. On 9-11 we felt it.

Although formalized as a State doctrine, [preemption establishes a
direct relation to life at its **most visceral level**]{.underline}. In
other words, [**to affect** -- to what hits us in the gut so immediately
that all we can do is reel, not yet reflect, not yet knowing how to act
in response]{.underline}. Affect at this level of the visceral hit that
suspends considered reflection and momentarily ~~paralyzes~~ \[stifles\]
action isn\'t what we normally think about as emotion. Through a
triggering event like 9-11, [it hits collectively, directly riveting a
whole population to a situation it is not yet capable of
categorizing]{.underline}. It braces us together in uncertainty, in the
terror of not yet being able to answer the question, \"what just
happened?\" [**Unlike an emotion**, affect at this level it is less
something we each have personally, than it is **something that has us
collectively**]{.underline}. [We are **taken up together in the
terror**.]{.underline} We are vaulted into it together. We are agape, in
suspense together. [We are all in it together, in the disorientation of
terror. We are swept up by it. We are moved by it]{.underline}

[Preemption establishes a direct link between the institutional level of
policy -- the formal level of collective organization \-- and the
informal affective level of sweeping collective disorientation and
agitated]{.underline} ~~paralysis~~ \[[inaction]{.underline}\]. With
preemption, this political link to the level of affective immediacy
becomes a motor of what happens. It goes off and running. [It sets in
motion an historical tendency that is **difficult to put the brakes on**
once it starts]{.underline}. That tendency has a certain logic of its
own.

I\'m not saying that the connection of politics to a visceral level
where reflection is momentarily suspended makes politics simply
irrational. I\'m saying that it gives preemption a logic of its own, and
that to understand what changed on 9-11, and how it stays the same the
more it changes, [we have to understand that logic, and what\'s
different about it.]{.underline}

There is something else that happens with preemption. There is another
significant shift, this one concerning time. Classically, a preemptive
attack is justified when there is \"a clear and present danger.\" **[But
threat inhabits the future.]{.underline}** Threats don\'t clearly
present themselves. [They vaguely loom, and their looming **casts a
shadow on the present**.]{.underline} [A threat is how an **uncertain
future makes-itself-felt in the present**.]{.underline} This has
immediate consequences on the plane of action. Even in ~~paralysis~~
\[inaction\], it can change how we will be disposed to act. [This
viscerally felt, affective presence of an uncertain future has
consequences for the future. In a weird way, **threat is a way in which
the future affects itself**]{.underline}.

What I\'ve just described is like a time-loop. [The future comes back to
the present to trigger a reaction that jolts the present back to the
future, along a different path of action than would have eventuated
otherwise]{.underline}. Threat is a strange animal: a future cause.
**[It comes from the future, to act on the futurity from which it
came]{.underline}**. In a sense, **[threat makes future
self-causing]{.underline}**. **[There is a kind of short-circuit in
time]{.underline}**. [A future cause (the looming of the threat) loops
through affect in a way that effectively **changes what goes
down**]{.underline}. Threat loops through affect to effect, never
surrendering the future tense.

By contrast, the classical doctrine of preemption as it was understand
pre-9-11 specifically referred to danger, not threat, as already
mentioned. Danger involves the linear relationship between cause and
effect that we are used to dealing with in our common-sense everyday
lives. A situation clearly presents itself; its objective
characteristics are analyzed; the analysis suggests reasonable paths of
action; a direction is chosen, and the present marches the straight and
narrow path to the future, as dictated by the decision. The effects of
the decision flow logically, step-bystep from it. Of course [all kinds
of **accidents can happen**. The path can be **miscalculated**. The
deliberations can be **flawed**, the implementation
**flubbed**]{.underline}. But the point remains that [there is an
assumption that decisions affecting the future can be based on
**objectively verifiable, empirically present conditions**, and that
political response begins with deliberation and is guided by
it.]{.underline} Here, the causes of things precede them in time. Their
effects feed forward from the empirical past, through the observable
present, and if all goes well, into a better future. [It\'s all nicely
ordered, **comfortably linear.**]{.underline}

[All of this gets seriously **twisted by threat**]{.underline}. Because,
once again, **[it\'s enough for a threat to be felt to make it
real]{.underline}**. [It needs no objective validation to have an effect
as a future cause. **It doesn\'t operate in the realm of the
objective**]{.underline}. [The future is precisely what is **not yet
objectively present**]{.underline}. **[It\'s not empirically
observable]{.underline}**. Preemption operates in the realm of affect.
Its concern is threat. If it is enough for threat to be felt for it to
be real and effective, then it\'s logical that the actions that
effectively flow from the feeling of threat are going to be justified
affectively as well. With preemption, the justification for actions, the
legitimation of political decision, tends to become fundamentally
affective. It is reasonable to say that a shift of this magnitude marks
a threshold where \"everything changes.\" [It\'s the **death knell** of
centuries of politics that were supposed to be guided by the \"**reason
of State**.\"]{.underline}

To get a sense of how this works, consider Bush\'s well-known rationales
for invading Iraq: 1) Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction; 2)
Iraq was a haven for Al-Qaeda and would be used as a launching pad for
further attacks.

The first rationale was vigorously discounted at the time by people
objectively a position to know, such as UN weapons inspector Hans Blix.
It was subsequently found to be entirely lacking any factual foundation.
What was Bush\'s response when he had to face up to the fact that he had
embarked on a costly war on objectively false premises? Did he apologize
for the thousands of allied lives lost? For the hundreds of thousands of
Iraqi lives lost? Did he admit having made a mistake? No, he reaffirmed
that his decision to invade had been right in spite of having no factual
basis. Because, he said, we can be certain that if Hussein had had
weapons of mass destruction, he would have used them. In a word, if he
could have, he would have. Maybe it\'s true he couldn\'t have then. But
had the US not invaded, he might have could-have later on.

[What threat does is **shift the mode of political decision from the
objective to the conditional** -- the \"could have / would have\" -- and
**treat the conditional as a certainty**]{.underline}. **[And it is a
certainty -- affectively speaking.]{.underline}** Bush certainly felt
that Hussein would have if he could have. This certainty is not an
informed judgment about a set of objective conditions. [It\'s a gut
feeling that there is a potential for something to happen]{.underline}.
The thing is, **[it is impossible to disprove a
potential]{.underline}**. [Even if nothing has happened years later,
nothing is disproven, because it might still happen years after that.
There\'s nothing to say that it couldn\'t. **No one can
know.**]{.underline} The only certainty is that you have to act now to
do everything possible to preempt the potential. In the vocabulary of
Bush\'s Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, [the only thing certain
is that **you have to \"go kinetic,\"** even though you don\'t really
know and can\'t know and know you don\'t know.]{.underline} There are
known knowns, Rumsfeld famously said and there are known unknowns. But
in the post 9-11 era of threat and terror, [what we\'re dealing with and
have to act on are the \"**unknown unknowns**]{.underline}.\" As Bush
put it in the quote cited earlier, \"the only path to safety is the path
to action\" -- against threats have not yet emerged. What has not yet
emerged can be nothing other than an unknown unknown.

[The best way to act when faced with the unknown unknown of a felt
threat vaguely looming is ... **quickly**]{.underline}. Otherwise you
may have acted too late.\"We will have waited too long,\" Bush warned.
[The only way to act quickly on an unknown unknown is to act
intuitively, using the same \"gut feeling\" you used to
feel-thethreat-into-reality]{.underline}. Bush, it is well known, prided
himself on deciding with his guts. He once actually said he used his
advisors primarily as \"mood rings.\"

So not only does preemption locate our actions in a realm of affect; not
only does it politically legitimate actions affectively; it makes affect
what makes them. **[All of this short-circuits objective assessment or
evidence-based reasoning]{.underline}**. **[Hair-trigger
action]{.underline}** [replaces deliberation. Rapid-response tactical
capabilities **replace considered strategy**.]{.underline} Remember the
outrage when members of Bush\'s inner circle were quoted by
investigative journalist Ron Suskind ridiculing what they called the
\"reality-based\" community. While you\'re off deliberating all nice and
civil about what\'s really real, they said, we\'re busy making reality,
in our gutsy, preemptive way. The phrase \"reality-based\" was
sarcastic. It\'s the height of illusion, they were saying, to treat a
looming threat as if it were a clear and present danger that can be
responded to in the old-fashioned way, as if the world were still
orderly and linear. **[No, what\'s realistic is go kinetic with utmost
urgency]{.underline}**. And when you do that, [you\'re not sitting back
reflecting on the reality, you\'re making it, you\'re producing
it.]{.underline}

How can an approach to decision-making based on vaguely looming
futurities that have not yet emerged, that are still in potential, that
as-yet exist only in the conditional, as would-haves and could-haves, in
a way that short-circuits the present of considered reflection into a
future time-loop -- how can that actually produce the real? How can
action legitimately bootstrap itself into reality, from a grounding in
affect and potential?

The answer is obvious if you think about the second rationale Bush gave
for going into Iraq. Iraq, he said, was a staging ground for Al Qaeda.
[Yes, the cynic might say. Iraq was a staging ground for Al Qaeda and
Al-Qaeda-like terrorist groupings -- but only **after the invasion, and
as a direct result of that preemptive action**]{.underline}. It was the
US invasion that created the conditions for AlQaeda to move in and
capitalize on the chaos and resentment the invasion unleashed. The
retort to that, following the logic of preemption, is simple. It
happened. That\'s the reality. Iraq did become a staging ground for
terrorrism -- which only goes to show that **[the potential was there
after all]{.underline}**.

the University of London. "Rethinking militarism as ideology: The
critique of violence after security," *Security Dialogue*, Vol. 49 (1-2)
-- Special issue on Militarism and security: Dialogue, possibilities and
limits. 44-- 56, doi: 10.1177/0967010617730949, p. 52-54)

[The range of critical security studies literatures calling for
desecuritization]{.underline} therefore [do not yet offer a full account
of militarism]{.underline} as I have elaborated it above, [in which
organized political violence is made desirable through ideology and
thereby loses strategic impetus and restraint. This is important because
it has also shaped the response of those seeking to reclaim security
against these critiques. Revealingly, these responses tend either to
reject the call for desecuritization as too pacifist or to develop
**safeguards** against the specific effects that these critics identify
with 'militarization', **rather than engaging with the underlying
ideological nature of militarism**. While this has certainly left their
analysis wanting, and reveals an equally unsatisfactory
conceptualization of militarism, it also shows the limitations and
vulnerability of critical security studies arguments calling for
desecuritization]{.underline}. For example, Booth argues that security
should only ever be the 'means' for the 'end' of emancipation (Booth,
2007: 114--115) and that means and ends should be related
'non-dualistically' (i.e. the means should be consistent with the ends
sought; see Booth, 2007: 428--441). He explicitly includes political
violence as a means that must be subject to this rule (Booth, 2007:
429--431), and he even embraces aspects of Gandhian nonviolence (Booth,
2007: 115). [Discussing the critique offered by securitization theory,
he responds, 'we would all presumably agree that the unnecessary
securitisation (militarisation) of issues is to be deplored, but there
are occasions when introducing a military dimension is
sensible']{.underline} (Booth, 2007: 168). [Booth's ethical criteria for
the use of force therefore give him the confidence to respond that not
all militarization is a bad thing, and that it can be used for
progressive ends]{.underline}. What is notable here is that Booth also
invokes a thin notion of 'militarization', more or less reducible to the
decision to use force, to establish his claim. He is quite comfortable
with the risks of militarization identified by securitization theory
because he believes he has circumvented them. By contrast, the critique
of militarism as ideology gives us more powerful tools to disagree with
Booth here. For Booth ignores the danger that, in conditions of
militarism, war can begin to serve a wide array of non-strategic
instrumentalities as a result of its ideological penetration of social
relations. Militarism can entrench a pattern of conflict by binding
social relations, subjectivities and identities to the pursuit of war,
thereby making war far less amenable to ethico-political discipline than
he imagines. By [setting up emancipation as an imperative that must be
'secured', including militarily, Booth opens a dangerous pathway to the
entrenchment of violence.]{.underline} Responding to critiques of
securitization in their cosmopolitan approach, [Burke, Lee-Koo and
McDonald]{.underline} are more sensitive to these dangers, admitting
that the use of force can entrench conflict and thus impair the longer
term pursuit of global security (Burke et al., 2014: 19--21). In
response, they argue that the ultimate aim of security practice should
always be nonviolence, 'a gradual but determined demilitarisation of
global politics' in which force is permissible under strict conditions
but always regrettable -- 'a pacifism of ends rather than means' (Burke
et al., 2016: 74). They [place their confidence in a set of detailed
principles restricting the use of force in different circumstances,
which they hope will help to avoid these risks]{.underline} (Burke et
al., 2014: 71--97, 119--145). [Again, however, the ambition for
nonviolence rests on the thin basis of an aspiration for
'demilitarization', something that they in fact derive from the critique
of securitization, rather than an understanding of militarism as
ideology]{.underline}. As I have explained above, [what characterizes
militarism is not violence with a lack of a true justification but an
ideological desire for war and military activity. Militarism is
therefore fully compatible with a credible justification for violence,
and may even draw strength from it]{.underline}. Burke, Lee-Koo and
McDonald's criteria for the use of force may well be stricter than
available alternatives, therefore, but this is still no guarantee
against militarism. Even if they succeeded in preventing some wars, they
would still not ensure that the remaining, apparently justified wars did
not indulge in and encourage militarism. [Cosmopolitan theories
therefore do not disrupt the ideological factors making war desirable;
rather, they risk supplementing them with additional justifications. A
more effective critical intervention against cosmopolitan security is
therefore to highlight the dangers of militarism as ideology, rather
than simply to call for demilitarization]{.underline}. Conclusion [What
the above arguments stress is the importance of embracing a critical
concept of militarism, one premised on the explicit ambition to disrupt
its ideological effects]{.underline}. With this in mind, it is worth
considering why most critical security studies scholars prefer to adopt
the term 'militarization' rather than 'militarism'. 'Militarization' in
this usage seems to imply the process of making something a military
concern. In this way, it is similar to Shaw's account, in which
militarization implies an increase in the penetration of social
relations in general by military relations -- or, in other words, the
process by which more and more things are made military concerns. [For
Shaw, the concept of militarism functions as a measure of this
penetration. But this is not the same as a critical concept of
militarism, in which the specific kind of penetration being analysed is
an ideological penetration and in which the intention is to disrupt this
penetration through critique]{.underline}. [Like Shaw, critical security
studies has also understood militarism as a **measure** (of
'militarization') **rather than as a critical concept**, with the result
that **its analytic and political potential has been blunted** when
engaging in the critique of violence.]{.underline} However, this may
also be a reflection of an underlying tendency in critical security
studies itself. For we could argue that [neither security nor
securitization are critical concepts in the sense intended by ideology
critique. Instead, they are more like measures, in that they measure
either how secure something is or how securitized an issue has become.
One consequence of this, which is particularly problematic for scholars
seeking desecuritization, is that these concepts therefore also actively
participate in the process they seek to critique: they name things as
'security' issues, even when the argument is that these issues should
not be security issues at all. This proliferation of security concerns,
encouraged as much by scholarship as by practitioners, results in the
'**crowding out' of other frameworks that** may **more accurately
reflect the underlying dynamics** -- concepts such as war]{.underline}
(Barkawi, 2011) [or neoliberalism]{.underline} (Montesinos Coleman and
Rosenow, 2016) -- [and that may be more appropriate for critical
ethico-political interventions into phenomena that critical security
studies interprets as security or securitization. My final suggestion is
that militarism is yet another concept that risks being obscured in
critical security studies analysis by this tendency to measure rather
than critique. By contrast, I have shown above how a more critical
concept of militarism as ideology can offer a **superior starting
point** for an analysis of the shortcomings of various justifications
for the use of force, including those encountered in critical security
studies. Militarism can help us to think more precisely about the
circumstances in which the use of violence to achieve political
objectives (such as 'security') can descend into a more generalized and
intractable desire for war and military activity. My hope is that **from
such an understanding we might** also **better equip ourselves to
intervene in this process and resist it**.]{.underline}

#### **Restricting arms sales doesn't challenge militarism. The 1AC understands violence through symptoms of militarism such as arms sales obscures which wider systems of violence and hierarchy that remain unchecked by the plan**

**Stavrianakis '19** (Anna, Professor of International Relations at the
University of Sussex. "Controlling weapons circulation in a postcolonial
militarised world," *Review of International Studies*, 45: 1, 57--76,
doi:10.1017/S0260210518000190, p. 75-76)

The [disagreements and silences]{.underline} of the ATT negotiations
[demonstrate the ways in which weapons circulation and regulation are
marked by different forms of militarism. The human security agenda has
made significant inroads to international public policy and social
science scholarship, and was an explicit driver of the ATT. While there
is much in the treaty that optimists see as having the potential to
better control the circulation of weapons, the argument put forward in
this article is that it is a mistake to see the treaty as a victory for
human security over militarism. Rather, human security has chipped away
at some of the most egregious manifestations of militarism, been silent
on others, and proved to be an accommodation with global militarism in
its various forms]{.underline}. Human security, political economy and
sovereignty came into contestation during the negotiations as
expressions of different modes of militarism. [Weapons circulation takes
places within a system: there is a world arms market (including legal
and illicit strands) marked by asymmetry, hierarchy, and transnational
practices, in which many major exporting states that claim to care about
human security, in particular European states, already participate in
regimes based on ATT-like principles]{.underline}. Those that don't, or
are ambivalent about such multilateralism -- in particular Russia and
China, and the US, respectively -- are sceptical about claims made on
the basis of human rights and IHL. [Claims to protect human security
disconnect human rights and IHL violations from these patterns of
military asymmetry and hierarchy, and generate resistance from
non-liberal suppliers and recipients]{.underline}. So [the human
security agenda rests on the assumption that international politics can
remain militarised in one way (the absence of efforts at disarmament or
tackling military spending or military asymmetry) and yet be
demilitarised in another]{.underline} (efforts to decrease the
likelihood that weapons will be used in human rights or IHL violations),
in ways that the examples discussed above suggest are untenable.
Resistance to the ATT from a significant minority of Southern states may
well be politically ugly, but needs to be understood in the context of
asymmetry in the world military order, as does US dominance of the
negotiations for a treaty to which it is a signatory but not a State
Party. In the desire to promote the spread of human security practices,
there has been little attention to why an initiative such as the ATT
might be resisted, beyond narrowly strategic or instrumental concerns or
a failure to internalise human security norms. [Thinking about modes of
militarism, and the ways in which the human security agenda has
transformed, but not necessarily diminished, militarism can help us
think more creatively, both analytically and politically, about what is
at stake. We need to understand and explain patterns of militarism
because of the paradoxical role of military power and systematic or
organised violence in international relation]{.underline}s. On the one
hand, military power has historically been fundamental to the
constitution of organised political power, be it in the form of the
state or otherwise. On the other hand, demilitarisation from current
levels and forms is a condition for improved human security. A
contraction of the influence of the "social relations, institutions and
values" of war and war preparation on social relations, institutions and
values more generally120 reduces the likelihood of violent responses to
political problems, reduces the secrecy and corruption associated with
military decisions or military involvement in the economy, and lowers
the opportunity costs associated with high levels of military spending,
to name a few reasons. But militarism has been pushed off the agenda,
precisely because it strikes at the core issues around war preparation
and the constitution of political community and political economy, and
because the maintenance of coercive capacities in the South is central
to aid donors' and Southern elites' interests, not to mention the
entrenched coercive orientation of Northern states' foreign policies.
For these reasons [a human security agenda is limited in terms of its
ability to generate more restrictive weapons transfer practices.
However, it is also deeply interested, in the sense of having political
effects. Human security has become a dominant policy
orientation]{.underline} among aid donors and NGOs, [is eminently
fundable by donors who claim the mantle of benevolence without wanting
to change their weapons transfer practices, and has been mobilised in
scholarship in pursuit of a normative project]{.underline}. While the
practical gains made by any treaty will always be partial, the more
significant ramification is that the [gains]{.underline} made in the ATT
help [set the parameters of politically feasible action, and
obscure]{.underline} some of the [core political projects that are
sustained by the circulation of weapons.]{.underline}

#### Their descriptions of Russian domestic unrest stems from a narcissistic cold war ideology that makes relations impossible 

**Crosston '15** (Matthew, Professor of Political Science at Bellevue
University, "NEMESIS: Keeping Russia an Enemy through Cold War
Pathologies", Forthcoming in Сравнительная Политика, No. 3 (19), 2015,

Moscow, Russian Federation, pgs. 11-15)

There is no stronger example of the schizophrenic nature of American
foreign policy toward Russia than comparing statements written in the
formal National Security Strategy (NSS) of President Obama with actual
testimony given by the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.
[In 2010 the NSS asserted that the U.S. would endeavor to 'build a
stable, substantive, multidimensional relationship with Russia, based on
mutual interests.']{.underline} What's more, the NSS called Russia a
21st century center of influence in the world and a country with whom
America should build bilateral cooperation on a host of issues,
[including forging global nonproliferation; confronting violent
extremism; fostering new trade and development arrangements; promoting
the rule of law, accountability in government and universal values in
Russia; and in cooperating as a partner in Europe and
Asia.]{.underline}15 Now take into account [Director James Clapper while
appearing before Congress in 2013 to discuss global
threats]{.underline}. He [described Russian foreign policy as a nexus of
organized crime, state policy, and business interests (let it be noted
that all three of these descriptors were said
pejoratively)]{.underline}.16 [Clapper went on to warn that both China
and Russia represented the most persistent intelligence threats to the
United States and that Russia could even face social
discontent]{.underline} (read: political disorder and revolution)
[because of a sluggish economy, the constraint of political pluralism,
and pervasive corruption]{.underline}.17 [At first blush these two
accounts seem to offer a completely incompatible attitude toward Russia.
Reading deeper between the lines of the NSS reveals key words, however,
that always trigger contempt from Russian actors in the Kremlin. The
ideal of 'promoting rule of law, government accountability and universal
values' is not an olive branch offering Russia the chance to team up
with America. This ideal is not being promoted with Russia but in
Russia.]{.underline} To follow that goal up with being a 'cooperative
partner' in Europe and Asia has also always signaled to Russian ears an
American skepticism about Russia's ability to be a 'non-meddler'[. In
other words, the NSS comes across to Russians not as a mechanism to
promote deeper co-equal ties between the two countries but rather as a
snobbish slap across the face about how the United States needs to
engage Russia to stop it from getting in its own and others'
way]{.underline}. Clapper's comments in some ways garner even more
derision from Moscow. Not so much the complaints about centralized power
and corruption. Russia has been hearing these criticisms since Yeltsin
first came down off the tanks after the August coup in 1991. Russia has
always been rather dismissive of these arguments. Rather, Clapper's
comments about the possibility of social discontent and unrest, placing
that possibility at the feet of the Russian government because of
repression and incompetence, always comes off as a red flag to the bull
of Russian conspiracy theorists: they are quick to see American
interference in any and all things that go wrong in Russia. And even if
the more rational voices in Russian political power dismiss conspiracy
theories, there is still the obvious interpretation that while America
might not try to personally foment unrest, Clapper's comments make it
seem like instability would be welcomed. The U.S. government at times
can play too fast and loose with semantics: as long as America does not
actively try to create discord it thinks it cannot possibly be seen as a
source of such discord. Very few actors around the globe agree with that
interpretation, especially Russians. [To this day Russians point to
Georgia, to Ukraine, to the countries of the Arab Spring, to Syria, and
believe the build-up to the unrest was either directly orchestrated by
the United States or at least subtly fostered by America. To Russians
there is no difference between 'actively pursuing' and 'subtly managing'
while to Americans they are complete polar opposites. This is what
allows Russia to take statements about bilateral cooperation and
substantive partnership and see nothing but animosity, mistrust, and
manipulation.]{.underline} Indeed, it is surprising there is not more
analysis comparing the U.S. National Security Strategy with the
subsequent Russian foreign policy concept that came out in 2013 on the
heels of Clapper's testimony. It affirms the Putin criticism that
U.S.-Russia relations will always remain complicated because of
fundamental cultural differences. What might be these cultural
differences? Namely, that [American identity is based on individual
wants, racism, genocidal and other extreme forms of violence and thus
will always conflict with Russian identity, which is based on 'loftier
ambitions, more of a spiritual kind]{.underline}.'18 This was only
compounded on September 11th of the same year, when [Putin published a
letter to the New York Times: • The UN could collapse and international
law would suffer if nations take military action without UN approval. •
Such action in Syria would only result in a total destabilization of the
area and a widening of conflict and terrorism. • Russia is protecting,
therefore, international law rather than the Assad regime. • Many in the
world are beginning to see the United States as relying solely on brute
force and that such U.S. reliance has proven ineffective and pointless.
• President Obama's statement that the United States should act when
possible to uphold international norms was 'extremely dangerous,'
arguing that all countries are equal already under international
law]{.underline}.19 [This amounts to nothing more than
posturing]{.underline} presidencies and tit-for-tat foreign policy,
where each side envisions the other as the chief global antagonist while
promoting themselves as the cowboy in the white hat standing up for the
less powerful in the world. But it is important to note that Russia's
tit, as it were, came after America's tat. Rightly or wrongly, Russia is
convinced that America has a global agenda that pushes not only itself
as a single unilateral superpower but also pays special attention to
keeping Russia on the sidelines, politically and militarily
marginalized. What this de facto means for U.S-Russia relations is that
the highest office in both countries cannot actually be counted upon to
inspire new and better interaction and engagement. Rather, the
administrations of the two presidents seem rather intent and eager to
only make things worse. Given the aforementioned section showing how
media outlets and academic think tanks also tend to not improve the
situation, this leaves very little room for analysts to carve some
balance and fairness into the debate. Despite this problem, some are
indeed attempting to carve that space and deserve greater attention.

#### This investment in securitization sustains an affective economy of perpetual preemptive warfare 

**Massumi 14** (Brian Massumi, professor in the Communication Department
of the University of Montreal, 2013-2014, "The Remains of the Day," *On
Violence* Volume 1, modified)

To help answer our questions, [preemption can\'t be thought of as simply
a doctrine. Doctrines change as political actors and institutions turn
over]{.underline}. Preemption was a doctrine -- in the aftermath of
9-11, it became the stated war doctrine of the George W Bush
administration. [But as **a formative historical force with a power to
regather itself** and follow its own momentum, it overflowed the Bush
administration and flowed into the Obama administration, and will likely
flow beyond it.]{.underline} In addition, [it can be argued that it
overflowed the borders of the United States, **going
global**]{.underline}.

[Preemption in this sense is a tendency that **cannot be reduced to a
time- and place-specific doctrine**. Tendencies are
**self-propagating**]{.underline}. They have a power to repeat their
operations in different times and places. Doctrines must be applied.
**[Tendencies are self-applying. They are self-driving]{.underline}**.
This makes them a force to be contended within their own right

[The question, then, is how preemption constitutes a self-driving
tendency that has to be construed as a force of history passing through
shifts in doctrine and changes in casts of characters.]{.underline}

We\'ll start from the way preemption was formulated as a doctrine by
George W Bush in response to the 9-11 attacks \-- and then consider how
what was encapsulated in that doctrine took on a momentum of its own.

This is the doctrine, Bush\'s own words: \"If we wait for threats to
fully materialize, we will have waited too long. **[We must take the
battle to the enemy]{.underline}**, disrupt his plans and confront the
worst threats before they emerge. In the world we have entered, **[the
only path to safety is the path to action.\"]{.underline}**

Now some might actually see this as an example of \"the more things
change, the more they stay the same,\" because the right to preemptive
attack has been a part of the practice of war for as long as there have
been wars, and is a part of classical war theory and the law of war.
However, [in the past, preemptive attack was considered justified in
response to \"a clear and present danger]{.underline}.\" **[the Bush
doctrine changed danger to threat]{.underline}**.

[The first thing this does is **shift the emphasis to the affective
register**]{.underline}. A clear and present danger is observable and in
principle objectively verifiable, whereas **[a threat only has to be
felt to be.]{.underline}** [It has a visceral reality that is
**self-confirming**]{.underline}. **[If you feel threatened, you
are]{.underline}** -- end of story. On 9-11 we felt it.

Although formalized as a State doctrine, [preemption establishes a
direct relation to life at its **most visceral level**]{.underline}. In
other words, [**to affect** -- to what hits us in the gut so immediately
that all we can do is reel, not yet reflect, not yet knowing how to act
in response]{.underline}. Affect at this level of the visceral hit that
suspends considered reflection and momentarily ~~paralyzes~~ \[stifles\]
action isn\'t what we normally think about as emotion. Through a
triggering event like 9-11, [it hits collectively, directly riveting a
whole population to a situation it is not yet capable of
categorizing]{.underline}. It braces us together in uncertainty, in the
terror of not yet being able to answer the question, \"what just
happened?\" [**Unlike an emotion**, affect at this level it is less
something we each have personally, than it is **something that has us
collectively**]{.underline}. [We are **taken up together in the
terror**.]{.underline} We are vaulted into it together. We are agape, in
suspense together. [We are all in it together, in the disorientation of
terror. We are swept up by it. We are moved by it]{.underline}

[Preemption establishes a direct link between the institutional level of
policy -- the formal level of collective organization \-- and the
informal affective level of sweeping collective disorientation and
agitated]{.underline} ~~paralysis~~ \[[inaction]{.underline}\]. With
preemption, this political link to the level of affective immediacy
becomes a motor of what happens. It goes off and running. [It sets in
motion an historical tendency that is **difficult to put the brakes on**
once it starts]{.underline}. That tendency has a certain logic of its
own.

I\'m not saying that the connection of politics to a visceral level
where reflection is momentarily suspended makes politics simply
irrational. I\'m saying that it gives preemption a logic of its own, and
that to understand what changed on 9-11, and how it stays the same the
more it changes, [we have to understand that logic, and what\'s
different about it.]{.underline}

There is something else that happens with preemption. There is another
significant shift, this one concerning time. Classically, a preemptive
attack is justified when there is \"a clear and present danger.\" **[But
threat inhabits the future.]{.underline}** Threats don\'t clearly
present themselves. [They vaguely loom, and their looming **casts a
shadow on the present**.]{.underline} [A threat is how an **uncertain
future makes-itself-felt in the present**.]{.underline} This has
immediate consequences on the plane of action. Even in ~~paralysis~~
\[inaction\], it can change how we will be disposed to act. [This
viscerally felt, affective presence of an uncertain future has
consequences for the future. In a weird way, **threat is a way in which
the future affects itself**]{.underline}.

What I\'ve just described is like a time-loop. [The future comes back to
the present to trigger a reaction that jolts the present back to the
future, along a different path of action than would have eventuated
otherwise]{.underline}. Threat is a strange animal: a future cause.
**[It comes from the future, to act on the futurity from which it
came]{.underline}**. In a sense, **[threat makes future
self-causing]{.underline}**. **[There is a kind of short-circuit in
time]{.underline}**. [A future cause (the looming of the threat) loops
through affect in a way that effectively **changes what goes
down**]{.underline}. Threat loops through affect to effect, never
surrendering the future tense.

By contrast, the classical doctrine of preemption as it was understand
pre-9-11 specifically referred to danger, not threat, as already
mentioned. Danger involves the linear relationship between cause and
effect that we are used to dealing with in our common-sense everyday
lives. A situation clearly presents itself; its objective
characteristics are analyzed; the analysis suggests reasonable paths of
action; a direction is chosen, and the present marches the straight and
narrow path to the future, as dictated by the decision. The effects of
the decision flow logically, step-bystep from it. Of course [all kinds
of **accidents can happen**. The path can be **miscalculated**. The
deliberations can be **flawed**, the implementation
**flubbed**]{.underline}. But the point remains that [there is an
assumption that decisions affecting the future can be based on
**objectively verifiable, empirically present conditions**, and that
political response begins with deliberation and is guided by
it.]{.underline} Here, the causes of things precede them in time. Their
effects feed forward from the empirical past, through the observable
present, and if all goes well, into a better future. [It\'s all nicely
ordered, **comfortably linear.**]{.underline}

[All of this gets seriously **twisted by threat**]{.underline}. Because,
once again, **[it\'s enough for a threat to be felt to make it
real]{.underline}**. [It needs no objective validation to have an effect
as a future cause. **It doesn\'t operate in the realm of the
objective**]{.underline}. [The future is precisely what is **not yet
objectively present**]{.underline}. **[It\'s not empirically
observable]{.underline}**. Preemption operates in the realm of affect.
Its concern is threat. If it is enough for threat to be felt for it to
be real and effective, then it\'s logical that the actions that
effectively flow from the feeling of threat are going to be justified
affectively as well. With preemption, the justification for actions, the
legitimation of political decision, tends to become fundamentally
affective. It is reasonable to say that a shift of this magnitude marks
a threshold where \"everything changes.\" [It\'s the **death knell** of
centuries of politics that were supposed to be guided by the \"**reason
of State**.\"]{.underline}

To get a sense of how this works, consider Bush\'s well-known rationales
for invading Iraq: 1) Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction; 2)
Iraq was a haven for Al-Qaeda and would be used as a launching pad for
further attacks.

The first rationale was vigorously discounted at the time by people
objectively a position to know, such as UN weapons inspector Hans Blix.
It was subsequently found to be entirely lacking any factual foundation.
What was Bush\'s response when he had to face up to the fact that he had
embarked on a costly war on objectively false premises? Did he apologize
for the thousands of allied lives lost? For the hundreds of thousands of
Iraqi lives lost? Did he admit having made a mistake? No, he reaffirmed
that his decision to invade had been right in spite of having no factual
basis. Because, he said, we can be certain that if Hussein had had
weapons of mass destruction, he would have used them. In a word, if he
could have, he would have. Maybe it\'s true he couldn\'t have then. But
had the US not invaded, he might have could-have later on.

[What threat does is **shift the mode of political decision from the
objective to the conditional** -- the \"could have / would have\" -- and
**treat the conditional as a certainty**]{.underline}. **[And it is a
certainty -- affectively speaking.]{.underline}** Bush certainly felt
that Hussein would have if he could have. This certainty is not an
informed judgment about a set of objective conditions. [It\'s a gut
feeling that there is a potential for something to happen]{.underline}.
The thing is, **[it is impossible to disprove a
potential]{.underline}**. [Even if nothing has happened years later,
nothing is disproven, because it might still happen years after that.
There\'s nothing to say that it couldn\'t. **No one can
know.**]{.underline} The only certainty is that you have to act now to
do everything possible to preempt the potential. In the vocabulary of
Bush\'s Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, [the only thing certain
is that **you have to \"go kinetic,\"** even though you don\'t really
know and can\'t know and know you don\'t know.]{.underline} There are
known knowns, Rumsfeld famously said and there are known unknowns. But
in the post 9-11 era of threat and terror, [what we\'re dealing with and
have to act on are the \"**unknown unknowns**]{.underline}.\" As Bush
put it in the quote cited earlier, \"the only path to safety is the path
to action\" -- against threats have not yet emerged. What has not yet
emerged can be nothing other than an unknown unknown.

[The best way to act when faced with the unknown unknown of a felt
threat vaguely looming is ... **quickly**]{.underline}. Otherwise you
may have acted too late.\"We will have waited too long,\" Bush warned.
[The only way to act quickly on an unknown unknown is to act
intuitively, using the same \"gut feeling\" you used to
feel-thethreat-into-reality]{.underline}. Bush, it is well known, prided
himself on deciding with his guts. He once actually said he used his
advisors primarily as \"mood rings.\"

So not only does preemption locate our actions in a realm of affect; not
only does it politically legitimate actions affectively; it makes affect
what makes them. **[All of this short-circuits objective assessment or
evidence-based reasoning]{.underline}**. **[Hair-trigger
action]{.underline}** [replaces deliberation. Rapid-response tactical
capabilities **replace considered strategy**.]{.underline} Remember the
outrage when members of Bush\'s inner circle were quoted by
investigative journalist Ron Suskind ridiculing what they called the
\"reality-based\" community. While you\'re off deliberating all nice and
civil about what\'s really real, they said, we\'re busy making reality,
in our gutsy, preemptive way. The phrase \"reality-based\" was
sarcastic. It\'s the height of illusion, they were saying, to treat a
looming threat as if it were a clear and present danger that can be
responded to in the old-fashioned way, as if the world were still
orderly and linear. **[No, what\'s realistic is go kinetic with utmost
urgency]{.underline}**. And when you do that, [you\'re not sitting back
reflecting on the reality, you\'re making it, you\'re producing
it.]{.underline}

How can an approach to decision-making based on vaguely looming
futurities that have not yet emerged, that are still in potential, that
as-yet exist only in the conditional, as would-haves and could-haves, in
a way that short-circuits the present of considered reflection into a
future time-loop -- how can that actually produce the real? How can
action legitimately bootstrap itself into reality, from a grounding in
affect and potential?

The answer is obvious if you think about the second rationale Bush gave
for going into Iraq. Iraq, he said, was a staging ground for Al Qaeda.
[Yes, the cynic might say. Iraq was a staging ground for Al Qaeda and
Al-Qaeda-like terrorist groupings -- but only **after the invasion, and
as a direct result of that preemptive action**]{.underline}. It was the
US invasion that created the conditions for AlQaeda to move in and
capitalize on the chaos and resentment the invasion unleashed. The
retort to that, following the logic of preemption, is simple. It
happened. That\'s the reality. Iraq did become a staging ground for
terrorrism -- which only goes to show that **[the potential was there
after all]{.underline}**.

#### **Beginning with a widened structural criticism of militarism is a pre-requisite to effective critical ethico-political interventions -- voting aff crowds out critical readings of militarism** 

**Eastwood '18** (James, Professor in the School of Politics and IR at
the University of London. "Rethinking militarism as ideology: The
critique of violence after security," *Security Dialogue*, Vol. 49 (1-2)
-- Special issue on Militarism and security: Dialogue, possibilities and
limits. 44-- 56, doi: 10.1177/0967010617730949, p. 52-54)

[The range of critical security studies literatures calling for
desecuritization]{.underline} therefore [do not yet offer a full account
of militarism]{.underline} as I have elaborated it above, [in which
organized political violence is made desirable through ideology and
thereby loses strategic impetus and restraint. This is important because
it has also shaped the response of those seeking to reclaim security
against these critiques. Revealingly, these responses tend either to
reject the call for desecuritization as too pacifist or to develop
**safeguards** against the specific effects that these critics identify
with 'militarization', **rather than engaging with the underlying
ideological nature of militarism**. While this has certainly left their
analysis wanting, and reveals an equally unsatisfactory
conceptualization of militarism, it also shows the limitations and
vulnerability of critical security studies arguments calling for
desecuritization]{.underline}. For example, Booth argues that security
should only ever be the 'means' for the 'end' of emancipation (Booth,
2007: 114--115) and that means and ends should be related
'non-dualistically' (i.e. the means should be consistent with the ends
sought; see Booth, 2007: 428--441). He explicitly includes political
violence as a means that must be subject to this rule (Booth, 2007:
429--431), and he even embraces aspects of Gandhian nonviolence (Booth,
2007: 115). [Discussing the critique offered by securitization theory,
he responds, 'we would all presumably agree that the unnecessary
securitisation (militarisation) of issues is to be deplored, but there
are occasions when introducing a military dimension is
sensible']{.underline} (Booth, 2007: 168). [Booth's ethical criteria for
the use of force therefore give him the confidence to respond that not
all militarization is a bad thing, and that it can be used for
progressive ends]{.underline}. What is notable here is that Booth also
invokes a thin notion of 'militarization', more or less reducible to the
decision to use force, to establish his claim. He is quite comfortable
with the risks of militarization identified by securitization theory
because he believes he has circumvented them. By contrast, the critique
of militarism as ideology gives us more powerful tools to disagree with
Booth here. For Booth ignores the danger that, in conditions of
militarism, war can begin to serve a wide array of non-strategic
instrumentalities as a result of its ideological penetration of social
relations. Militarism can entrench a pattern of conflict by binding
social relations, subjectivities and identities to the pursuit of war,
thereby making war far less amenable to ethico-political discipline than
he imagines. By [setting up emancipation as an imperative that must be
'secured', including militarily, Booth opens a dangerous pathway to the
entrenchment of violence.]{.underline} Responding to critiques of
securitization in their cosmopolitan approach, [Burke, Lee-Koo and
McDonald]{.underline} are more sensitive to these dangers, admitting
that the use of force can entrench conflict and thus impair the longer
term pursuit of global security (Burke et al., 2014: 19--21). In
response, they argue that the ultimate aim of security practice should
always be nonviolence, 'a gradual but determined demilitarisation of
global politics' in which force is permissible under strict conditions
but always regrettable -- 'a pacifism of ends rather than means' (Burke
et al., 2016: 74). They [place their confidence in a set of detailed
principles restricting the use of force in different circumstances,
which they hope will help to avoid these risks]{.underline} (Burke et
al., 2014: 71--97, 119--145). [Again, however, the ambition for
nonviolence rests on the thin basis of an aspiration for
'demilitarization', something that they in fact derive from the critique
of securitization, rather than an understanding of militarism as
ideology]{.underline}. As I have explained above, [what characterizes
militarism is not violence with a lack of a true justification but an
ideological desire for war and military activity. Militarism is
therefore fully compatible with a credible justification for violence,
and may even draw strength from it]{.underline}. Burke, Lee-Koo and
McDonald's criteria for the use of force may well be stricter than
available alternatives, therefore, but this is still no guarantee
against militarism. Even if they succeeded in preventing some wars, they
would still not ensure that the remaining, apparently justified wars did
not indulge in and encourage militarism. [Cosmopolitan theories
therefore do not disrupt the ideological factors making war desirable;
rather, they risk supplementing them with additional justifications. A
more effective critical intervention against cosmopolitan security is
therefore to highlight the dangers of militarism as ideology, rather
than simply to call for demilitarization]{.underline}. Conclusion [What
the above arguments stress is the importance of embracing a critical
concept of militarism, one premised on the explicit ambition to disrupt
its ideological effects]{.underline}. With this in mind, it is worth
considering why most critical security studies scholars prefer to adopt
the term 'militarization' rather than 'militarism'. 'Militarization' in
this usage seems to imply the process of making something a military
concern. In this way, it is similar to Shaw's account, in which
militarization implies an increase in the penetration of social
relations in general by military relations -- or, in other words, the
process by which more and more things are made military concerns. [For
Shaw, the concept of militarism functions as a measure of this
penetration. But this is not the same as a critical concept of
militarism, in which the specific kind of penetration being analysed is
an ideological penetration and in which the intention is to disrupt this
penetration through critique]{.underline}. [Like Shaw, critical security
studies has also understood militarism as a **measure** (of
'militarization') **rather than as a critical concept**, with the result
that **its analytic and political potential has been blunted** when
engaging in the critique of violence.]{.underline} However, this may
also be a reflection of an underlying tendency in critical security
studies itself. For we could argue that [neither security nor
securitization are critical concepts in the sense intended by ideology
critique. Instead, they are more like measures, in that they measure
either how secure something is or how securitized an issue has become.
One consequence of this, which is particularly problematic for scholars
seeking desecuritization, is that these concepts therefore also actively
participate in the process they seek to critique: they name things as
'security' issues, even when the argument is that these issues should
not be security issues at all. This proliferation of security concerns,
encouraged as much by scholarship as by practitioners, results in the
'**crowding out' of other frameworks that** may **more accurately
reflect the underlying dynamics** -- concepts such as war]{.underline}
(Barkawi, 2011) [or neoliberalism]{.underline} (Montesinos Coleman and
Rosenow, 2016) -- [and that may be more appropriate for critical
ethico-political interventions into phenomena that critical security
studies interprets as security or securitization. My final suggestion is
that militarism is yet another concept that risks being obscured in
critical security studies analysis by this tendency to measure rather
than critique. By contrast, I have shown above how a more critical
concept of militarism as ideology can offer a **superior starting
point** for an analysis of the shortcomings of various justifications
for the use of force, including those encountered in critical security
studies. Militarism can help us to think more precisely about the
circumstances in which the use of violence to achieve political
objectives (such as 'security') can descend into a more generalized and
intractable desire for war and military activity. My hope is that **from
such an understanding we might** also **better equip ourselves to
intervene in this process and resist it**.]{.underline}

#### **Restricting FMS/DCS maintains the colonial order. The aff results in a regulation regime that helps to consolidate power in the West and restore legitimacy to the image of the US** 

**Cooper '18** (Neil, Professor of International Relations and Security
Studies and Head of Peace Studies at University of Bradford. "Race,
Sovereignty, and Free Trade: Arms Trade Regulation and Humanitarian Arms
Control in the Age of Empire," *Journal of Global Security Studies*,
3(4), 2018, 444--462 doi: 10.1093/jogss/ogy013, p. 457-459)

This article has offered [a more complete understanding of the dynamics
of arms trade regulation]{.underline} in the late nineteenth century. In
this concluding section, I also draw on this understanding to [provide
insights into current debates about norms, arms regulation, and arms
control as governmentality. The 1890 Brussels Act can be understood as
the first matryoshka doll of arms trade governance---a discrete
initiative that]{.underline}, in this case, [aimed to regulate the
import of a specified class of weapons into a specified area of Africa.
From the perspective of proponents, the act was the outcome of a grand
humanitarian campaign to restrict the arms (and liquor) trade to
Africa]{.underline}. Indeed, it can be understood, in part, as an effort
to graft a regulatory arms trade norm onto an established and
constitutive anti-slavery norm. [At the same time, policymakers were
also motivated by a more prosaic concern to maintain qualitative
military superiority over colonial subjects in Africa. Nevertheless,
judged in isolation, the campaign for the Brussels Act can be understood
as a relatively successful initiative that managed to merge the
requirements of colonial order with a particularly paternalist and
orientalist humanitarianism]{.underline}. Moreover, with the exception
of the arms traffic to Abyssinia and Somalia, implementation of the act
was more extensive than has generally been acknowledged. [However, the
Brussels Act represented just one element in a larger network of
regulation aimed at restricting the supply of arms to colonial subjects
in all the spaces of empire. This constituted the second Matryoshka doll
of arms trade governance. Thus, rather than being an era of free trade
in arms, the period was actually characterized by a dual regime of
regulation: the operation of a peacetime liberal export norm for
transfers from imperial metropoles combined with widespread efforts to
manage arms flows into, within, and between the spaces of
empire]{.underline} (using post-export blockades, import controls,
internal regulations, and restrictions on transfers between colonial
spaces). [This contrasts with the contemporary emphasis on producer
export controls as a primary (if not exclusive) vehicle for managing the
global trade in conventional arms. When located in this broader network
of prohibitory regulation, the humanitarian underpinnings of the
Brussels Act are revealed to be far less significant than the concerns
about the maintenance of colonial order and qualitative military
advantage for imperial power]{.underline}s. Of course, [the operation of
a free trade in arms philosophy combined with competition for colonies,
markets, and influence amongst imperial powers is generally deemed to
have trumped substantive efforts at limiting arms flows. However,
practices of proscription and permission were both part of the attempt
to delineate who could legitimately use which gradations of weapons
according to where they were located in the triple hierarchies of
civilization, loyalty, and utility to empire]{.underline}. This is not
to deny that local actors constantly engaged in strategies of evasion or
that imperial policies were perennially reversed or amended. Indeed,
both permissive and proscriptive arms trade norms were the site of
recurring contestation that played out in the form of competing appeals
to transnational constitutive norms such as sovereignty, free trade,
colonialism, and the standard of civilization. [Nevertheless, the
oscillations in policy this produced are better understood less as a
failure of prohibition and more as constituting the fluid cartography of
regulation that was (and is) a defining feature of arms control as
governmentality]{.underline}. Moreover, [the process of serially
reinventing the border between legitimate and illegitimate ownership of,
and trade in, the means of violence represented an important political
project in its own right, irrespective of the actual material impact on
arms flows]{.underline}. Indeed, [the understanding of arms trade
governance as a Sisyphean endeavor was (and remains) central to the
legitimizing politics of arms control as governmentality; sanctifying
the performative of regulatory and institutional refinement, an á la
carte approach to normative frameworks (e.g. humanitarianism, free
trade, military necessity) and their application to specific arms trade
policy questions]{.underline}. Nevertheless, by the early 1900s colonial
powers had developed fairly extensive mechanisms of regulation that, in
general, were probably as effective as the mechanisms of contemporary
arms trade regulation heralded by optimists as signaling a shift to a
novel form of global arms governance. [What insights, then, can we draw
into contemporary debates in the literature on post-Cold War arms trade
regulation? First, the simplistic claim that contemporary HAC
initiatives, including those on small arms, are "novel" just does not
stand up to historical analysis. This bears repeating time and time
again given the frequency with which the former claim is recycled. What
is more useful, therefore, is to reflect on the ways in which
contemporary HAC is or is not novel compared to antecedents such as the
Brussels Act and to use this reflection as the basis for evaluating
current debates in the literature on HAC]{.underline}. There are some
notable differences. The Brussels Act was concerned with restricting
what were then considered new, modern, and technologically cutting-edge
firearms, whereas contemporary small arms are generally viewed as a
mature technology. Even more notably, the overt racism that
characterized the discursive landscape of nineteenth-century HAC has
largely disappeared. Similarly, a feature of contemporary transnational
initiatives on small arms, landmines, and the ATT has been the way these
initiatives have been actively promoted by key states and civil society
organizations from the Global South (Efrat 2012, 66; Bromley, Cooper,
and Holtom 2012, 1039). The global architecture of small arms regulation
also includes regional agreements, such as the ECOWAS moratorium on
SALW, that are composed solely of states from the Global South. [This is
certainly indicative of changes in power relations between North and
South.]{.underline} Nevertheless, northern [NGOs remain the primary
gatekeepers determining what issues (e.g., landmines as opposed to
thermobaric weapons) become the focus of civil society
campaigns]{.underline} (Carpenter 2014). Northern actors have also been
the largest funders of HAC campaigns on small arms, landmines, and
cluster munitions, whilst northern NGOs have been the largest recipients
of this funding (Stavrianakis 2011, 208; O'Dwyer 2014). Moreover, whilst
HAC campaigns are certainly framed as expressions of cosmopolitan
solidarism, they have also drawn on largely uninterrogated standard of
civilization norms and are not immune to the recycling of orientalist
assumptions about the legitimacy and motivations of different suppliers,
recipients, and users of the instruments of violence (Stavrianakis 2011;
Mathur 2014). Furthermore, there have been notable moves to liberalize
arms exports, particularly with respect to intra-Western transfers
(Cooper 2011, 147--49). [This indicates the need to abandon the
uncritical assumption of the optimists that the merging of arms control
and humanitarianism must, by definition, be both positive and
transformative]{.underline}. As demonstrated here, the
[merging]{.underline} of [the two is not]{.underline} necessarily
[incompatible with colonialism, racism, and imperial
violence]{.underline}. Moreover, both Brussels and the broader operation
of [arms control as governmentality illustrate how]{.underline} HAC
[initiatives may not represent a victory for "good norms" over "bad
norms" but the way in which such initiatives are situated within the
regulatory logics produced by both.]{.underline} Indeed, [victories for
HAC may neither challenge nor reconstitute hegemonic practices of
security and economy. Instead, they may be achieved because apparently
disparate and divergent normative frameworks constitute historically
contingent norm hierarchies that produce the conditions of possibility
for the emergence of particular modes of arms trade governance and their
associated logics of permission and restraint. Certainly, arms trade
regulation in the age of empire, including its humanitarian variants,
never challenged the logic of liberal militarism and in many respects
was harnessed to it]{.underline}. [The Brussels Act, in particular,
represented an early example of the "devil's bargain" in which
humanitarian restraint was achieved at the expense of legitimizing the
arms, forms of violence, and ways of war practiced by hegemonic
powers]{.underline}. There are similarities here with many contemporary
HAC campaigns, which have been equally focused on controlling violence
in the peripheries. Such campaigns have also been characterized by the
way in which key groups such as the ICRC have sought to distance
themselves from disarmament activists and antimilitarism to make HAC
agendas more palatable to policymakers (Carpenter 2014, 105 and 117).
[This indicates the need for caution in assuming that successive limited
humanitarian initiatives can change the dominant logics of militarism
whilst also extracting a critique of militarism from those same
initiatives.]{.underline} Of course, the recent success of the
humanitarian campaign to ban nuclear weapons might suggest a shift in
HAC towards a more effective merging of humanitarianism and
antimilitarism. Even here, however, it is notable that campaigners have
attempted to retain the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate
weapons, and the distinction between disarmament as an overarching goal
and strategy and disarmament as a weapons-specific tactic (Fihn 2017;
UNIDIR 2017, 10). Moreover, it is notable that nuclear weapon states
have neither signed the ban treaty nor abandoned expensive nuclear
modernization programs (Korb 2017). Thus, [both Brussels and
contemporary HAC initiatives illustrate the "limits of possibility"
inherent in pursuing the empty promise of tactical humanitarian
"disarmament" without strategic demilitarization. It is worth noting in
this context that in historical terms, the Brussels Act and the broader
range of initiatives to manage arms flows in the spaces of Empire were
essentially transitory---they did not produce a lasting change in arms
trade norms or in the international system]{.underline}. In part at
least, this was because prohibitory arms trade norms emerged as elements
in the normative superstructure of the era rather than as constitutive
norms in their own right. At the same time, it was also the case that
from the 1930s onwards, changes in the substance of transnational
constitutive norms pertaining to sovereignty, security, economy, and
colonialism created the permissive conditions for a new set of
regulatory arms trade norms to emerge through new processes of grafting
and counter-grafting. There were, of course, elements of earlier
approaches in the use of arms supplies to "the friendlies" in the wars
of decolonization and anticommunism. More generally, however, arms trade
regulation in the Cold War was characterized more by a sovereign
approach to arms control that emphasized the creation and expansion of
peacetime national export licensing systems and the use of regulation to
achieve security between states. Arms trade norms were ultimately at the
mercy of these far larger shifts in foundational constitutive norms.
[All this should prompt due modesty on the part of the optimists
heralding the normative transformations supposedly wrought by HAC
initiatives]{.underline} such as those on small arms. [This article also
highlights the need for a more thoroughgoing genealogical approach to
the histories of both HAC and arms trade regulation (governmental and
sovereign). This is more obviously the domain of the critical school of
thinking on arms trade regulation. In the case of the optimists, both
the evident flaws of humanitarian arms trade regulation in the late
nineteenth century and its essentially transient nature demonstrate why
they need to think more historically about the relationship between
humanitarianism and arms regulation. Indeed, despite the differences
between nineteenth- and twenty-first-century HAC, they have yet to
convincingly demonstrate why things might turn out differently this time
around.]{.underline}

#### Legal debates about drones normalizes the virtuality of war -- the aff will be circumvented by the military industrial complex

**Gregory '11** (Derek Gregory, Peter Wall Distinguished Professor of
Geography at the University of British Colombia in Vancouver, 2011,
"From a View to a Kill: Drones and Late Modern War," *Theory, Culture &
Society* Volume 28 Numbers 7-8)

[ADVANCED MILITARIES like to boast that their conduct of war has become
surgical, sensitive and scrupulous]{.underline} (Gregory, 2010a). [The
development of a precision-strike capability, the cultural turn towards
a counterinsurgency that places the local population at the centre of
its operations, and the refinement of the legal armature that regulates
armed conflict have all contributed to the celebration of]{.underline}
what Der Derian (2009) calls '[virtuous war'. At its heart]{.underline},
he argues, [is the technical ability and ethical imperative to threaten
and, if necessary, actualize violence from a distance -- with no or
minimal casualties]{.underline}. [Using networked information and
virtual technologies to bring 'there' here in near-real time and with
near-verisimilitude, virtuous war exercises a comparative as well as
strategic advantage for the digitally advanced.]{.underline} Along with
time (as in the sense of tempo) as the fourth dimension, [virtuality has
become the 'fifth dimension' of US global hegemony]{.underline}. (2009:
xxi) And [at the heart of the ascent of war from the virtual to the
virtuous are the drone wars being waged by the USA in the global
borderlands]{.underline}.1 Two qualifications are immediately necessary.
First, remotely piloted aircraft have been used since the First World
War, assault drones were deployed in the closing stages of the Second
World War, and the first major combat use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) was during the Vietnam War, so [there is a considerable history
behind today's remote operations in the borderlands. There it intersects
with the exercise of a profoundly colonial modality of air
power.]{.underline} The British invented aerial counterinsurgency on the
North West Frontier with Afghanistan and in Iraq (Mesopotamia) in the
1920s (Omissi, 1990; Satia, 2008, 2009), and for all the technical
advances there are numerous dispiriting parallels between then and now.
[Perhaps the most telling is the repeated insistence that air attacks
are counterproductive]{.underline}. Two commentators closely identified
with the new US counterinsurgency doctrine insist that 'expanding or
even continuing the drone war \[in Pakistan\] would be a mistake'. They
explain: While violent extremists may be unpopular, for a frightened
population they seem less ominous than a faceless enemy that wages war
from afar and often kills more civilians than militants. \... [\[E\]very
one of these dead noncombatants represents an alienated family, a new
desire for revenge, and more recruits for a militant
movement]{.underline} that has grown exponentially even as drone strikes
have increased. (Kilcullen and Exum, 2009) Colonel F.S. Keen said much
the same of the bombing of Pashtun villages on the North West Frontier
in 1923: 'By driving the inhabitants of the bombarded area from their
homes in a state of exasperation, dispersing them among neighbouring
clans and tribes with hatred in their hearts at what they consider
''unfair'' methods of warfare', he wrote, these attacks 'bring about the
exact political results which it is so important in our own interests to
avoid, viz., the permanent embitterment and alienation of the frontier
tribes' (Keen, 1923: 400; see also Roe, 2008). As my parallel suggests
-- and this is the second qualification -- [the modern debate has
focused on the covert war waged by CIA-operated drones in the Federally
Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan]{.underline}. The campaign was
initiated by President George W. Bush in 2004, and by the end of 2008
there had been 46 strikes directed at killing so-called 'High Value
Targets'. The attacks were ramped up by Obama, and by the end of 2010
there had been another 170 strikes.2 These operations raise complex and
troubling legal questions, not least because the United States is not at
war with Pakistan. [On one side are those who defend the strikes as
limited and legitimate acts of self-defense against attacks from the
Taliban who seek sanctuary across the border and also as an effective
counterterrorism tactic against al-Qaeda. Indeed, Anderson describes
'perfect war', the very summit of 'virtuous war', as 'target selection
perfected to the point of assassination', a doctrine for which drones
have become the weapon of choice]{.underline} ('the only game in town',
according to the Director of the CIA) (see, for example, Anderson, 2009;
Paust, 2009). [On the other side are critics who insist that such
targeting, however 'precise', amounts to extra-judicial killing, and
that if civilian agencies like the CIA conduct military operations then
their agents become unlawful combatants. Their objections also fasten on
the spatiality of the war zone: they draw special attention to the
imprecise legal delineation of the 'global battlespace' invoked by the
United States and to the lack of accountability for civilian
casualties]{.underline} (see, for example, O'Connell, 2009; Rogers,
2010; Solis, 2010). [But for the most part all these arguments assume
that the use of UAVs]{.underline} by the United States Air Force (USAF)
and its military allies in Afghanistan -- including Britain and Canada
-- [is unproblematic, and in doing so they reinforce the claim that
these new technologies enable advanced militaries to conduct 'virtuous
war'. This]{.underline} article [seeks to interrogate those assumptions,
but I have to note that it is not easy to disentangle one campaign from
the other.]{.underline} Some commentators have suggested that the USAF
is involved to varying degrees in the CIA strikes, but in any case the
Air Force uses the Pentagon's Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List
to conduct its own strikes on leaders of the Taliban and others who may
have only a proximate relation to the war in Afghanistan, and makes no
secret of the fact that [a prime function of its Predators and Reapers
is to 'put warheads on foreheads']{.underline} (Mulrine, 2008) (Figure
1).3

#### This investment in securitization sustains an affective economy of perpetual preemptive warfare 

**Massumi 14** (Brian Massumi, professor in the Communication Department
of the University of Montreal, 2013-2014, "The Remains of the Day," *On
Violence* Volume 1, modified)

To help answer our questions, [preemption can\'t be thought of as simply
a doctrine. Doctrines change as political actors and institutions turn
over]{.underline}. Preemption was a doctrine -- in the aftermath of
9-11, it became the stated war doctrine of the George W Bush
administration. [But as **a formative historical force with a power to
regather itself** and follow its own momentum, it overflowed the Bush
administration and flowed into the Obama administration, and will likely
flow beyond it.]{.underline} In addition, [it can be argued that it
overflowed the borders of the United States, **going
global**]{.underline}.

[Preemption in this sense is a tendency that **cannot be reduced to a
time- and place-specific doctrine**. Tendencies are
**self-propagating**]{.underline}. They have a power to repeat their
operations in different times and places. Doctrines must be applied.
**[Tendencies are self-applying. They are self-driving]{.underline}**.
This makes them a force to be contended within their own right

[The question, then, is how preemption constitutes a self-driving
tendency that has to be construed as a force of history passing through
shifts in doctrine and changes in casts of characters.]{.underline}

We\'ll start from the way preemption was formulated as a doctrine by
George W Bush in response to the 9-11 attacks \-- and then consider how
what was encapsulated in that doctrine took on a momentum of its own.

This is the doctrine, Bush\'s own words: \"If we wait for threats to
fully materialize, we will have waited too long. **[We must take the
battle to the enemy]{.underline}**, disrupt his plans and confront the
worst threats before they emerge. In the world we have entered, **[the
only path to safety is the path to action.\"]{.underline}**

Now some might actually see this as an example of \"the more things
change, the more they stay the same,\" because the right to preemptive
attack has been a part of the practice of war for as long as there have
been wars, and is a part of classical war theory and the law of war.
However, [in the past, preemptive attack was considered justified in
response to \"a clear and present danger]{.underline}.\" **[the Bush
doctrine changed danger to threat]{.underline}**.

[The first thing this does is **shift the emphasis to the affective
register**]{.underline}. A clear and present danger is observable and in
principle objectively verifiable, whereas **[a threat only has to be
felt to be.]{.underline}** [It has a visceral reality that is
**self-confirming**]{.underline}. **[If you feel threatened, you
are]{.underline}** -- end of story. On 9-11 we felt it.

Although formalized as a State doctrine, [preemption establishes a
direct relation to life at its **most visceral level**]{.underline}. In
other words, [**to affect** -- to what hits us in the gut so immediately
that all we can do is reel, not yet reflect, not yet knowing how to act
in response]{.underline}. Affect at this level of the visceral hit that
suspends considered reflection and momentarily ~~paralyzes~~ \[stifles\]
action isn\'t what we normally think about as emotion. Through a
triggering event like 9-11, [it hits collectively, directly riveting a
whole population to a situation it is not yet capable of
categorizing]{.underline}. It braces us together in uncertainty, in the
terror of not yet being able to answer the question, \"what just
happened?\" [**Unlike an emotion**, affect at this level it is less
something we each have personally, than it is **something that has us
collectively**]{.underline}. [We are **taken up together in the
terror**.]{.underline} We are vaulted into it together. We are agape, in
suspense together. [We are all in it together, in the disorientation of
terror. We are swept up by it. We are moved by it]{.underline}

[Preemption establishes a direct link between the institutional level of
policy -- the formal level of collective organization \-- and the
informal affective level of sweeping collective disorientation and
agitated]{.underline} ~~paralysis~~ \[[inaction]{.underline}\]. With
preemption, this political link to the level of affective immediacy
becomes a motor of what happens. It goes off and running. [It sets in
motion an historical tendency that is **difficult to put the brakes on**
once it starts]{.underline}. That tendency has a certain logic of its
own.

I\'m not saying that the connection of politics to a visceral level
where reflection is momentarily suspended makes politics simply
irrational. I\'m saying that it gives preemption a logic of its own, and
that to understand what changed on 9-11, and how it stays the same the
more it changes, [we have to understand that logic, and what\'s
different about it.]{.underline}

There is something else that happens with preemption. There is another
significant shift, this one concerning time. Classically, a preemptive
attack is justified when there is \"a clear and present danger.\" **[But
threat inhabits the future.]{.underline}** Threats don\'t clearly
present themselves. [They vaguely loom, and their looming **casts a
shadow on the present**.]{.underline} [A threat is how an **uncertain
future makes-itself-felt in the present**.]{.underline} This has
immediate consequences on the plane of action. Even in ~~paralysis~~
\[inaction\], it can change how we will be disposed to act. [This
viscerally felt, affective presence of an uncertain future has
consequences for the future. In a weird way, **threat is a way in which
the future affects itself**]{.underline}.

What I\'ve just described is like a time-loop. [The future comes back to
the present to trigger a reaction that jolts the present back to the
future, along a different path of action than would have eventuated
otherwise]{.underline}. Threat is a strange animal: a future cause.
**[It comes from the future, to act on the futurity from which it
came]{.underline}**. In a sense, **[threat makes future
self-causing]{.underline}**. **[There is a kind of short-circuit in
time]{.underline}**. [A future cause (the looming of the threat) loops
through affect in a way that effectively **changes what goes
down**]{.underline}. Threat loops through affect to effect, never
surrendering the future tense.

By contrast, the classical doctrine of preemption as it was understand
pre-9-11 specifically referred to danger, not threat, as already
mentioned. Danger involves the linear relationship between cause and
effect that we are used to dealing with in our common-sense everyday
lives. A situation clearly presents itself; its objective
characteristics are analyzed; the analysis suggests reasonable paths of
action; a direction is chosen, and the present marches the straight and
narrow path to the future, as dictated by the decision. The effects of
the decision flow logically, step-bystep from it. Of course [all kinds
of **accidents can happen**. The path can be **miscalculated**. The
deliberations can be **flawed**, the implementation
**flubbed**]{.underline}. But the point remains that [there is an
assumption that decisions affecting the future can be based on
**objectively verifiable, empirically present conditions**, and that
political response begins with deliberation and is guided by
it.]{.underline} Here, the causes of things precede them in time. Their
effects feed forward from the empirical past, through the observable
present, and if all goes well, into a better future. [It\'s all nicely
ordered, **comfortably linear.**]{.underline}

[All of this gets seriously **twisted by threat**]{.underline}. Because,
once again, **[it\'s enough for a threat to be felt to make it
real]{.underline}**. [It needs no objective validation to have an effect
as a future cause. **It doesn\'t operate in the realm of the
objective**]{.underline}. [The future is precisely what is **not yet
objectively present**]{.underline}. **[It\'s not empirically
observable]{.underline}**. Preemption operates in the realm of affect.
Its concern is threat. If it is enough for threat to be felt for it to
be real and effective, then it\'s logical that the actions that
effectively flow from the feeling of threat are going to be justified
affectively as well. With preemption, the justification for actions, the
legitimation of political decision, tends to become fundamentally
affective. It is reasonable to say that a shift of this magnitude marks
a threshold where \"everything changes.\" [It\'s the **death knell** of
centuries of politics that were supposed to be guided by the \"**reason
of State**.\"]{.underline}

To get a sense of how this works, consider Bush\'s well-known rationales
for invading Iraq: 1) Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction; 2)
Iraq was a haven for Al-Qaeda and would be used as a launching pad for
further attacks.

The first rationale was vigorously discounted at the time by people
objectively a position to know, such as UN weapons inspector Hans Blix.
It was subsequently found to be entirely lacking any factual foundation.
What was Bush\'s response when he had to face up to the fact that he had
embarked on a costly war on objectively false premises? Did he apologize
for the thousands of allied lives lost? For the hundreds of thousands of
Iraqi lives lost? Did he admit having made a mistake? No, he reaffirmed
that his decision to invade had been right in spite of having no factual
basis. Because, he said, we can be certain that if Hussein had had
weapons of mass destruction, he would have used them. In a word, if he
could have, he would have. Maybe it\'s true he couldn\'t have then. But
had the US not invaded, he might have could-have later on.

[What threat does is **shift the mode of political decision from the
objective to the conditional** -- the \"could have / would have\" -- and
**treat the conditional as a certainty**]{.underline}. **[And it is a
certainty -- affectively speaking.]{.underline}** Bush certainly felt
that Hussein would have if he could have. This certainty is not an
informed judgment about a set of objective conditions. [It\'s a gut
feeling that there is a potential for something to happen]{.underline}.
The thing is, **[it is impossible to disprove a
potential]{.underline}**. [Even if nothing has happened years later,
nothing is disproven, because it might still happen years after that.
There\'s nothing to say that it couldn\'t. **No one can
know.**]{.underline} The only certainty is that you have to act now to
do everything possible to preempt the potential. In the vocabulary of
Bush\'s Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, [the only thing certain
is that **you have to \"go kinetic,\"** even though you don\'t really
know and can\'t know and know you don\'t know.]{.underline} There are
known knowns, Rumsfeld famously said and there are known unknowns. But
in the post 9-11 era of threat and terror, [what we\'re dealing with and
have to act on are the \"**unknown unknowns**]{.underline}.\" As Bush
put it in the quote cited earlier, \"the only path to safety is the path
to action\" -- against threats have not yet emerged. What has not yet
emerged can be nothing other than an unknown unknown.

[The best way to act when faced with the unknown unknown of a felt
threat vaguely looming is ... **quickly**]{.underline}. Otherwise you
may have acted too late.\"We will have waited too long,\" Bush warned.
[The only way to act quickly on an unknown unknown is to act
intuitively, using the same \"gut feeling\" you used to
feel-thethreat-into-reality]{.underline}. Bush, it is well known, prided
himself on deciding with his guts. He once actually said he used his
advisors primarily as \"mood rings.\"

So not only does preemption locate our actions in a realm of affect; not
only does it politically legitimate actions affectively; it makes affect
what makes them. **[All of this short-circuits objective assessment or
evidence-based reasoning]{.underline}**. **[Hair-trigger
action]{.underline}** [replaces deliberation. Rapid-response tactical
capabilities **replace considered strategy**.]{.underline} Remember the
outrage when members of Bush\'s inner circle were quoted by
investigative journalist Ron Suskind ridiculing what they called the
\"reality-based\" community. While you\'re off deliberating all nice and
civil about what\'s really real, they said, we\'re busy making reality,
in our gutsy, preemptive way. The phrase \"reality-based\" was
sarcastic. It\'s the height of illusion, they were saying, to treat a
looming threat as if it were a clear and present danger that can be
responded to in the old-fashioned way, as if the world were still
orderly and linear. **[No, what\'s realistic is go kinetic with utmost
urgency]{.underline}**. And when you do that, [you\'re not sitting back
reflecting on the reality, you\'re making it, you\'re producing
it.]{.underline}

How can an approach to decision-making based on vaguely looming
futurities that have not yet emerged, that are still in potential, that
as-yet exist only in the conditional, as would-haves and could-haves, in
a way that short-circuits the present of considered reflection into a
future time-loop -- how can that actually produce the real? How can
action legitimately bootstrap itself into reality, from a grounding in
affect and potential?

The answer is obvious if you think about the second rationale Bush gave
for going into Iraq. Iraq, he said, was a staging ground for Al Qaeda.
[Yes, the cynic might say. Iraq was a staging ground for Al Qaeda and
Al-Qaeda-like terrorist groupings -- but only **after the invasion, and
as a direct result of that preemptive action**]{.underline}. It was the
US invasion that created the conditions for AlQaeda to move in and
capitalize on the chaos and resentment the invasion unleashed. The
retort to that, following the logic of preemption, is simple. It
happened. That\'s the reality. Iraq did become a staging ground for
terrorrism -- which only goes to show that **[the potential was there
after all]{.underline}**.

#### **Beginning with a widened structural criticism of militarism is a pre-requisite to effective critical ethico-political interventions -- voting aff crowds out critical readings of militarism** 

**Eastwood '18** (James, Professor in the School of Politics and IR at
the University of London. "Rethinking militarism as ideology: The
critique of violence after security," *Security Dialogue*, Vol. 49 (1-2)
-- Special issue on Militarism and security: Dialogue, possibilities and
limits. 44-- 56, doi: 10.1177/0967010617730949, p. 52-54)

[The range of critical security studies literatures calling for
desecuritization]{.underline} therefore [do not yet offer a full account
of militarism]{.underline} as I have elaborated it above, [in which
organized political violence is made desirable through ideology and
thereby loses strategic impetus and restraint. This is important because
it has also shaped the response of those seeking to reclaim security
against these critiques. Revealingly, these responses tend either to
reject the call for desecuritization as too pacifist or to develop
**safeguards** against the specific effects that these critics identify
with 'militarization', **rather than engaging with the underlying
ideological nature of militarism**. While this has certainly left their
analysis wanting, and reveals an equally unsatisfactory
conceptualization of militarism, it also shows the limitations and
vulnerability of critical security studies arguments calling for
desecuritization]{.underline}. For example, Booth argues that security
should only ever be the 'means' for the 'end' of emancipation (Booth,
2007: 114--115) and that means and ends should be related
'non-dualistically' (i.e. the means should be consistent with the ends
sought; see Booth, 2007: 428--441). He explicitly includes political
violence as a means that must be subject to this rule (Booth, 2007:
429--431), and he even embraces aspects of Gandhian nonviolence (Booth,
2007: 115). [Discussing the critique offered by securitization theory,
he responds, 'we would all presumably agree that the unnecessary
securitisation (militarisation) of issues is to be deplored, but there
are occasions when introducing a military dimension is
sensible']{.underline} (Booth, 2007: 168). [Booth's ethical criteria for
the use of force therefore give him the confidence to respond that not
all militarization is a bad thing, and that it can be used for
progressive ends]{.underline}. What is notable here is that Booth also
invokes a thin notion of 'militarization', more or less reducible to the
decision to use force, to establish his claim. He is quite comfortable
with the risks of militarization identified by securitization theory
because he believes he has circumvented them. By contrast, the critique
of militarism as ideology gives us more powerful tools to disagree with
Booth here. For Booth ignores the danger that, in conditions of
militarism, war can begin to serve a wide array of non-strategic
instrumentalities as a result of its ideological penetration of social
relations. Militarism can entrench a pattern of conflict by binding
social relations, subjectivities and identities to the pursuit of war,
thereby making war far less amenable to ethico-political discipline than
he imagines. By [setting up emancipation as an imperative that must be
'secured', including militarily, Booth opens a dangerous pathway to the
entrenchment of violence.]{.underline} Responding to critiques of
securitization in their cosmopolitan approach, [Burke, Lee-Koo and
McDonald]{.underline} are more sensitive to these dangers, admitting
that the use of force can entrench conflict and thus impair the longer
term pursuit of global security (Burke et al., 2014: 19--21). In
response, they argue that the ultimate aim of security practice should
always be nonviolence, 'a gradual but determined demilitarisation of
global politics' in which force is permissible under strict conditions
but always regrettable -- 'a pacifism of ends rather than means' (Burke
et al., 2016: 74). They [place their confidence in a set of detailed
principles restricting the use of force in different circumstances,
which they hope will help to avoid these risks]{.underline} (Burke et
al., 2014: 71--97, 119--145). [Again, however, the ambition for
nonviolence rests on the thin basis of an aspiration for
'demilitarization', something that they in fact derive from the critique
of securitization, rather than an understanding of militarism as
ideology]{.underline}. As I have explained above, [what characterizes
militarism is not violence with a lack of a true justification but an
ideological desire for war and military activity. Militarism is
therefore fully compatible with a credible justification for violence,
and may even draw strength from it]{.underline}. Burke, Lee-Koo and
McDonald's criteria for the use of force may well be stricter than
available alternatives, therefore, but this is still no guarantee
against militarism. Even if they succeeded in preventing some wars, they
would still not ensure that the remaining, apparently justified wars did
not indulge in and encourage militarism. [Cosmopolitan theories
therefore do not disrupt the ideological factors making war desirable;
rather, they risk supplementing them with additional justifications. A
more effective critical intervention against cosmopolitan security is
therefore to highlight the dangers of militarism as ideology, rather
than simply to call for demilitarization]{.underline}. Conclusion [What
the above arguments stress is the importance of embracing a critical
concept of militarism, one premised on the explicit ambition to disrupt
its ideological effects]{.underline}. With this in mind, it is worth
considering why most critical security studies scholars prefer to adopt
the term 'militarization' rather than 'militarism'. 'Militarization' in
this usage seems to imply the process of making something a military
concern. In this way, it is similar to Shaw's account, in which
militarization implies an increase in the penetration of social
relations in general by military relations -- or, in other words, the
process by which more and more things are made military concerns. [For
Shaw, the concept of militarism functions as a measure of this
penetration. But this is not the same as a critical concept of
militarism, in which the specific kind of penetration being analysed is
an ideological penetration and in which the intention is to disrupt this
penetration through critique]{.underline}. [Like Shaw, critical security
studies has also understood militarism as a **measure** (of
'militarization') **rather than as a critical concept**, with the result
that **its analytic and political potential has been blunted** when
engaging in the critique of violence.]{.underline} However, this may
also be a reflection of an underlying tendency in critical security
studies itself. For we could argue that [neither security nor
securitization are critical concepts in the sense intended by ideology
critique. Instead, they are more like measures, in that they measure
either how secure something is or how securitized an issue has become.
One consequence of this, which is particularly problematic for scholars
seeking desecuritization, is that these concepts therefore also actively
participate in the process they seek to critique: they name things as
'security' issues, even when the argument is that these issues should
not be security issues at all. This proliferation of security concerns,
encouraged as much by scholarship as by practitioners, results in the
'**crowding out' of other frameworks that** may **more accurately
reflect the underlying dynamics** -- concepts such as war]{.underline}
(Barkawi, 2011) [or neoliberalism]{.underline} (Montesinos Coleman and
Rosenow, 2016) -- [and that may be more appropriate for critical
ethico-political interventions into phenomena that critical security
studies interprets as security or securitization. My final suggestion is
that militarism is yet another concept that risks being obscured in
critical security studies analysis by this tendency to measure rather
than critique. By contrast, I have shown above how a more critical
concept of militarism as ideology can offer a **superior starting
point** for an analysis of the shortcomings of various justifications
for the use of force, including those encountered in critical security
studies. Militarism can help us to think more precisely about the
circumstances in which the use of violence to achieve political
objectives (such as 'security') can descend into a more generalized and
intractable desire for war and military activity. My hope is that **from
such an understanding we might** also **better equip ourselves to
intervene in this process and resist it**.]{.underline}

**Stavrianakis '19** (Anna, Professor of International Relations at the
University of Sussex. "Controlling weapons circulation in a postcolonial
militarised world," *Review of International Studies*, 45: 1, 57--76,

The [disagreements and silences]{.underline} of the ATT negotiations
[demonstrate the ways in which weapons circulation and regulation are
marked by different forms of militarism. The human security agenda has
made significant inroads to international public policy and social
science scholarship, and was an explicit driver of the ATT. While there
is much in the treaty that optimists see as having the potential to
better control the circulation of weapons, the argument put forward in
this article is that it is a mistake to see the treaty as a victory for
human security over militarism. Rather, human security has chipped away
at some of the most egregious manifestations of militarism, been silent
on others, and proved to be an accommodation with global militarism in
its various forms]{.underline}. Human security, political economy and
sovereignty came into contestation during the negotiations as
expressions of different modes of militarism. [Weapons circulation takes
places within a system: there is a world arms market (including legal
and illicit strands) marked by asymmetry, hierarchy, and transnational
practices, in which many major exporting states that claim to care about
human security, in particular European states, already participate in
regimes based on ATT-like principles]{.underline}. Those that don't, or
are ambivalent about such multilateralism -- in particular Russia and
China, and the US, respectively -- are sceptical about claims made on
the basis of human rights and IHL. [Claims to protect human security
disconnect human rights and IHL violations from these patterns of
military asymmetry and hierarchy, and generate resistance from
non-liberal suppliers and recipients]{.underline}. So [the human
security agenda rests on the assumption that international politics can
remain militarised in one way (the absence of efforts at disarmament or
tackling military spending or military asymmetry) and yet be
demilitarised in another]{.underline} (efforts to decrease the
likelihood that weapons will be used in human rights or IHL violations),
in ways that the examples discussed above suggest are untenable.
Resistance to the ATT from a significant minority of Southern states may
well be politically ugly, but needs to be understood in the context of
asymmetry in the world military order, as does US dominance of the
negotiations for a treaty to which it is a signatory but not a State
Party. In the desire to promote the spread of human security practices,
there has been little attention to why an initiative such as the ATT
might be resisted, beyond narrowly strategic or instrumental concerns or
a failure to internalise human security norms. [Thinking about modes of
militarism, and the ways in which the human security agenda has
transformed, but not necessarily diminished, militarism can help us
think more creatively, both analytically and politically, about what is
at stake. We need to understand and explain patterns of militarism
because of the paradoxical role of military power and systematic or
organised violence in international relation]{.underline}s. On the one
hand, military power has historically been fundamental to the
constitution of organised political power, be it in the form of the
state or otherwise. On the other hand, demilitarisation from current
levels and forms is a condition for improved human security. A
contraction of the influence of the "social relations, institutions and
values" of war and war preparation on social relations, institutions and
values more generally120 reduces the likelihood of violent responses to
political problems, reduces the secrecy and corruption associated with
military decisions or military involvement in the economy, and lowers
the opportunity costs associated with high levels of military spending,
to name a few reasons. But militarism has been pushed off the agenda,
precisely because it strikes at the core issues around war preparation
and the constitution of political community and political economy, and
because the maintenance of coercive capacities in the South is central
to aid donors' and Southern elites' interests, not to mention the
entrenched coercive orientation of Northern states' foreign policies.
For these reasons [a human security agenda is limited in terms of its
ability to generate more restrictive weapons transfer practices.
However, it is also deeply interested, in the sense of having political
effects. Human security has become a dominant policy
orientation]{.underline} among aid donors and NGOs, [is eminently
fundable by donors who claim the mantle of benevolence without wanting
to change their weapons transfer practices, and has been mobilised in
scholarship in pursuit of a normative project]{.underline}. While the
practical gains made by any treaty will always be partial, the more
significant ramification is that the [gains]{.underline} made in the ATT
help [set the parameters of politically feasible action, and
obscure]{.underline} some of the [core political projects that are
sustained by the circulation of weapons.]{.underline}

Control in the Age of Empire," *Journal of Global Security Studies*,

This article has offered [a more complete understanding of the dynamics
of arms trade regulation]{.underline} in the late nineteenth century. In
this concluding section, I also draw on this understanding to [provide
insights into current debates about norms, arms regulation, and arms
control as governmentality. The 1890 Brussels Act can be understood as
the first matryoshka doll of arms trade governance---a discrete
initiative that]{.underline}, in this case, [aimed to regulate the
import of a specified class of weapons into a specified area of Africa.
From the perspective of proponents, the act was the outcome of a grand
humanitarian campaign to restrict the arms (and liquor) trade to
Africa]{.underline}. Indeed, it can be understood, in part, as an effort
to graft a regulatory arms trade norm onto an established and
constitutive anti-slavery norm. [At the same time, policymakers were
also motivated by a more prosaic concern to maintain qualitative
military superiority over colonial subjects in Africa. Nevertheless,
judged in isolation, the campaign for the Brussels Act can be understood
as a relatively successful initiative that managed to merge the
requirements of colonial order with a particularly paternalist and
orientalist humanitarianism]{.underline}. Moreover, with the exception
of the arms traffic to Abyssinia and Somalia, implementation of the act
was more extensive than has generally been acknowledged. [However, the
Brussels Act represented just one element in a larger network of
regulation aimed at restricting the supply of arms to colonial subjects
in all the spaces of empire. This constituted the second Matryoshka doll
of arms trade governance. Thus, rather than being an era of free trade
in arms, the period was actually characterized by a dual regime of
regulation: the operation of a peacetime liberal export norm for
transfers from imperial metropoles combined with widespread efforts to
manage arms flows into, within, and between the spaces of
empire]{.underline} (using post-export blockades, import controls,
internal regulations, and restrictions on transfers between colonial
spaces). [This contrasts with the contemporary emphasis on producer
export controls as a primary (if not exclusive) vehicle for managing the
global trade in conventional arms. When located in this broader network
of prohibitory regulation, the humanitarian underpinnings of the
Brussels Act are revealed to be far less significant than the concerns
about the maintenance of colonial order and qualitative military
advantage for imperial power]{.underline}s. Of course, [the operation of
a free trade in arms philosophy combined with competition for colonies,
markets, and influence amongst imperial powers is generally deemed to
have trumped substantive efforts at limiting arms flows. However,
practices of proscription and permission were both part of the attempt
to delineate who could legitimately use which gradations of weapons
according to where they were located in the triple hierarchies of
civilization, loyalty, and utility to empire]{.underline}. This is not
to deny that local actors constantly engaged in strategies of evasion or
that imperial policies were perennially reversed or amended. Indeed,
both permissive and proscriptive arms trade norms were the site of
recurring contestation that played out in the form of competing appeals
to transnational constitutive norms such as sovereignty, free trade,
colonialism, and the standard of civilization. [Nevertheless, the
oscillations in policy this produced are better understood less as a
failure of prohibition and more as constituting the fluid cartography of
regulation that was (and is) a defining feature of arms control as
governmentality]{.underline}. Moreover, [the process of serially
reinventing the border between legitimate and illegitimate ownership of,
and trade in, the means of violence represented an important political
project in its own right, irrespective of the actual material impact on
arms flows]{.underline}. Indeed, [the understanding of arms trade
governance as a Sisyphean endeavor was (and remains) central to the
legitimizing politics of arms control as governmentality; sanctifying
the performative of regulatory and institutional refinement, an á la
carte approach to normative frameworks (e.g. humanitarianism, free
trade, military necessity) and their application to specific arms trade
policy questions]{.underline}. Nevertheless, by the early 1900s colonial
powers had developed fairly extensive mechanisms of regulation that, in
general, were probably as effective as the mechanisms of contemporary
arms trade regulation heralded by optimists as signaling a shift to a
novel form of global arms governance. [What insights, then, can we draw
into contemporary debates in the literature on post-Cold War arms trade
regulation? First, the simplistic claim that contemporary HAC
initiatives, including those on small arms, are "novel" just does not
stand up to historical analysis. This bears repeating time and time
again given the frequency with which the former claim is recycled. What
is more useful, therefore, is to reflect on the ways in which
contemporary HAC is or is not novel compared to antecedents such as the
Brussels Act and to use this reflection as the basis for evaluating
current debates in the literature on HAC]{.underline}. There are some
notable differences. The Brussels Act was concerned with restricting
what were then considered new, modern, and technologically cutting-edge
firearms, whereas contemporary small arms are generally viewed as a
mature technology. Even more notably, the overt racism that
characterized the discursive landscape of nineteenth-century HAC has
largely disappeared. Similarly, a feature of contemporary transnational
initiatives on small arms, landmines, and the ATT has been the way these
initiatives have been actively promoted by key states and civil society
organizations from the Global South (Efrat 2012, 66; Bromley, Cooper,
and Holtom 2012, 1039). The global architecture of small arms regulation
also includes regional agreements, such as the ECOWAS moratorium on
SALW, that are composed solely of states from the Global South. [This is
certainly indicative of changes in power relations between North and
South.]{.underline} Nevertheless, northern [NGOs remain the primary
gatekeepers determining what issues (e.g., landmines as opposed to
thermobaric weapons) become the focus of civil society
campaigns]{.underline} (Carpenter 2014). Northern actors have also been
the largest funders of HAC campaigns on small arms, landmines, and
cluster munitions, whilst northern NGOs have been the largest recipients
of this funding (Stavrianakis 2011, 208; O'Dwyer 2014). Moreover, whilst
HAC campaigns are certainly framed as expressions of cosmopolitan
solidarism, they have also drawn on largely uninterrogated standard of
civilization norms and are not immune to the recycling of orientalist
assumptions about the legitimacy and motivations of different suppliers,
recipients, and users of the instruments of violence (Stavrianakis 2011;
Mathur 2014). Furthermore, there have been notable moves to liberalize
arms exports, particularly with respect to intra-Western transfers
(Cooper 2011, 147--49). [This indicates the need to abandon the
uncritical assumption of the optimists that the merging of arms control
and humanitarianism must, by definition, be both positive and
transformative]{.underline}. As demonstrated here, the
[merging]{.underline} of [the two is not]{.underline} necessarily
[incompatible with colonialism, racism, and imperial
violence]{.underline}. Moreover, both Brussels and the broader operation
of [arms control as governmentality illustrate how]{.underline} HAC
[initiatives may not represent a victory for "good norms" over "bad
norms" but the way in which such initiatives are situated within the
regulatory logics produced by both.]{.underline} Indeed, [victories for
HAC may neither challenge nor reconstitute hegemonic practices of
security and economy. Instead, they may be achieved because apparently
disparate and divergent normative frameworks constitute historically
contingent norm hierarchies that produce the conditions of possibility
for the emergence of particular modes of arms trade governance and their
associated logics of permission and restraint. Certainly, arms trade
regulation in the age of empire, including its humanitarian variants,
never challenged the logic of liberal militarism and in many respects
was harnessed to it]{.underline}. [The Brussels Act, in particular,
represented an early example of the "devil's bargain" in which
humanitarian restraint was achieved at the expense of legitimizing the
arms, forms of violence, and ways of war practiced by hegemonic
powers]{.underline}. There are similarities here with many contemporary
HAC campaigns, which have been equally focused on controlling violence
in the peripheries. Such campaigns have also been characterized by the
way in which key groups such as the ICRC have sought to distance
themselves from disarmament activists and antimilitarism to make HAC
agendas more palatable to policymakers (Carpenter 2014, 105 and 117).
[This indicates the need for caution in assuming that successive limited
humanitarian initiatives can change the dominant logics of militarism
whilst also extracting a critique of militarism from those same
initiatives.]{.underline} Of course, the recent success of the
humanitarian campaign to ban nuclear weapons might suggest a shift in
HAC towards a more effective merging of humanitarianism and
antimilitarism. Even here, however, it is notable that campaigners have
attempted to retain the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate
weapons, and the distinction between disarmament as an overarching goal
and strategy and disarmament as a weapons-specific tactic (Fihn 2017;
UNIDIR 2017, 10). Moreover, it is notable that nuclear weapon states
have neither signed the ban treaty nor abandoned expensive nuclear
modernization programs (Korb 2017). Thus, [both Brussels and
contemporary HAC initiatives illustrate the "limits of possibility"
inherent in pursuing the empty promise of tactical humanitarian
"disarmament" without strategic demilitarization. It is worth noting in
this context that in historical terms, the Brussels Act and the broader
range of initiatives to manage arms flows in the spaces of Empire were
essentially transitory---they did not produce a lasting change in arms
trade norms or in the international system]{.underline}. In part at
least, this was because prohibitory arms trade norms emerged as elements
in the normative superstructure of the era rather than as constitutive
norms in their own right. At the same time, it was also the case that
from the 1930s onwards, changes in the substance of transnational
constitutive norms pertaining to sovereignty, security, economy, and
colonialism created the permissive conditions for a new set of
regulatory arms trade norms to emerge through new processes of grafting
and counter-grafting. There were, of course, elements of earlier
approaches in the use of arms supplies to "the friendlies" in the wars
of decolonization and anticommunism. More generally, however, arms trade
regulation in the Cold War was characterized more by a sovereign
approach to arms control that emphasized the creation and expansion of
peacetime national export licensing systems and the use of regulation to
achieve security between states. Arms trade norms were ultimately at the
mercy of these far larger shifts in foundational constitutive norms.
[All this should prompt due modesty on the part of the optimists
heralding the normative transformations supposedly wrought by HAC
initiatives]{.underline} such as those on small arms. [This article also
highlights the need for a more thoroughgoing genealogical approach to
the histories of both HAC and arms trade regulation (governmental and
sovereign). This is more obviously the domain of the critical school of
thinking on arms trade regulation. In the case of the optimists, both
the evident flaws of humanitarian arms trade regulation in the late
nineteenth century and its essentially transient nature demonstrate why
they need to think more historically about the relationship between
humanitarianism and arms regulation. Indeed, despite the differences
between nineteenth- and twenty-first-century HAC, they have yet to
convincingly demonstrate why things might turn out differently this time
around.]{.underline}

### [Link -- Disarmament]{.underline} 

#### Disarm consolidates and preserves US military superiority and hegemonic domination 

**Cooper '06** (Neil, Department of Peace Studies @ University of
Bradford, "Putting Disarmament Back into Frame," *Cambridge Review of
International Studies*, 32.2, pg. 353-376, card p. 361-4)

However, whilst it is important (if only to counter the pessimistic
discourse surrounding this issue) to recognise the various disarmament
outcomes that have been generated under the current arms limitation
system, it is also important to recognise the context in which these
have occurred. In particular, [both disarmament and broader arms
limitation initiatives are now taking place as part of an asymmetrical
arms limitation system that has replaced the emphasis on balance between
the superpowers that dominated Cold War practice.]{.underline} 34 [It is
sufficient at this juncture to note that what characterises this system
of arms limitation is the way in which it is structured to **consolidate
and preserve the military superiority of the US** in particular **and
the West** in general.]{.underline} Moreover, rather than reinforcing
security [this profound military imbalance promotes insecurity -- both
by creating incentives for other actors to pursue asymmetric
technologies (NBC) or strategies (terrorism) that offset the US's
conventional superiority]{.underline},35 [and by diverting resources
that could be expended on human security to militarism.]{.underline} At
best, [the contemporary arms limitation system aims to keep the lid on
such contradictions by setting in place a variety of disciplinary
mechanisms that attempt to constrain asymmetric military responses
whilst simultaneously preserving the asymmetrical advantages of the
West.]{.underline} At worst, in attempting to contain pressures that may
ultimately be uncontainable, [the contemporary arms limitation system
may promote an illusion of relative security whilst positively fostering
a variety of insecurities]{.underline}. However, a few more comments are
in order before we proceed to consider this system of asymmetrical arms
limitation in more detail. Stuart Croft and arms control as threat
construction [The corollary of the preceding critique of arms control
theory is of course a requirement to develop conceptual frameworks (and
framings) that are capable of simultaneously challenging the hegemonic
discourse within the discipline and of producing greater explanatory
value. To date this attempt has been most convincingly pursued by
critical theorists and postmodernists such as Mutimer]{.underline},36
[and Krause and Latham]{.underline}.37 Even within the mainstream
literature on arms limitation however, there has been some attempt to
reconceptualise arms limitation practice. Most notably, Stuart Croft in
Strategies of Arms Control explicitly rejects the distinction between
arms control and disarmament as a basis for framing discussions of arms
limitation.38 Instead he develops a typology based around five different
strategies of arms control: arms control at the conclusion of major
conflicts, arms control to strengthen strategic stability, arms control
to create norms of behaviour, arms control to manage the proliferation
of weapons and arms control by international organisation. [This
certainly represents an improvement on more traditional discussions of
arms limitation. However, there are also a number of
problems]{.underline} with his analysis. First, Croft locates his
typology in a broader analysis that emphasises the idea that arms
control as an activity has been constantly widening (in the sense that
there has been a gradual accretion of strategies deployed to achieve it)
and that arms control agreements have become ever 'deeper' (in the sense
that agreements have become more detailed, arrangements for verification
have become both more common and more sophisticated, and the likelihood
of agreements taking on the qualities of a regime have increased).
Consequently, although Croft states that he is determined to avoid
making judgements on the success or failure of arms control both as
[theory and practice]{.underline}, he [nevertheless manage]{.underline}s
[to produce a **profoundly teleological (and** indeed **optimistic)
account** of the history of arms control/arms limitation.]{.underline}
However, there has not been a straightforward accretion of arms
limitation activity. Partly this is because the relevance of many arms
control agreements has simply declined with the advent of new military
technology. But even where this has not been the case, [**politics and
power** have **constantly** intruded both to **kill off arms limitation
initiatives** and to influence their depth]{.underline}. Examples
include Japanese and German disarmament after the Second World War, and
the US decision to renounce the ABM Treaty. Similarly, the two page SORT
Treaty highlights how the inexorable increase in depth described by
Croft in 1996 was, at best, a function of historically contingent Cold
War practices rather than some evolutionary manifest destiny.39 Second,
Croft states that investigation of the motivation for arms limitation is
outside the remit of his book. Despite noting the influence of politics
and power on arms limitation then, what Croft presents is a largely
mechanistic and apolitical analysis of the subject. Indeed, the
development of arms limitation practice is depicted as an essentially
autonomous process -- as if, to paraphrase Cox, arms limitation were not
always for some purpose and for someone.40 This is not untypical of the
majority of the literature in this field which tends to focus on the
technical minutiae of military strategy, diplomatic texts or policy
battles. The problems that arms limitation deals with are generally
taken as given and the purpose of such activity (just like arms control
theory itself) is to engage in producing 'problemsolving' solutions to
these issues. [What]{.underline} Croft, and [mainstream arms
controllers]{.underline} in general ignore, [is the role that arms
limitation activity plays in both reflecting broader constructions of
threat and in **reinforcing them**]{.underline}. Moreover, [whilst the
idea that arms limitation represents an arena where political power is
exercised is taken as axiomatic, power is generally understood to be
expressed in the relations between states]{.underline} (or internal
bureaucracies) [negotiating]{.underline} (or sometimes imposing)
specific [treaties, and measured in terms of who wins or loses in these
negotiations. The myriad ways in which hegemonic power is expressed
through developments in the dominant modes of arms limitation thinking
and practice rarely intrude]{.underline}. For example, [the power
expressed as a result of the role played by discourse and action over
arms limitation in affirming hegemonic projects of securitisation; the
power manifested in the specific ways in which the system of arms
limitation contributes to **maintain**ing particular **military and
social hierarchies** whether internally]{.underline}, within the state,
[or throughout the global system]{.underline}; and the relationship
between the interests of power and the ways in which [**arms limitation
reflects and reinforces** powerful political, economic and cultural
**tools of legitimation**/delegitimation **surrounding military
technology.**]{.underline} In other words (from a critical security
studies perspective at least), [the key questions surrounding arms
limitation are not so much who wins or loses in negotiations over a
specific treaty or how effective/ineffective that treaty turns out to
be]{.underline}. Rather, [the principal concern is with how the dominant
**discourse and practice of arms limitation** (not always the same
thing) **contributes to processes of securitisation and othering as well
as** military and **broader hegemonic practices**.]{.underline}

### [Link -- Distancing]{.underline} 

#### The 1AC constructs \[X REGION\] as a distant zone dominated by the violence and trauma of technological conflict. This contributes to the aestheticization of virtual warfare by representing the plan as a quick-fix solution to the spectacle of violence while leaving the social processes of militarization unchallenged.

**Deer '16** (Patrick, Associate Professor of English at New York
University, "Mapping Contemporary American War Culture", College
Literature Volume 43, Number 1, Winter 2016)

[When it comes to the conflicts abroad]{.underline}, the
[wars]{.underline} in Iraq and Afghanistan [have]{.underline} frequently
[been represented through the familiar **tropes of militarized** high
**technology, which** both **distance the war zones and turn their
civilian populations into targets, rendering them invisible
as**]{.underline} individual human [**subjects**. Tracing the
metaphors]{.underline}, imagery, and terminologies [through which these
wars have been represented in the domestic public sphere **allows us to
reconstruct the disturbed imaginary of** the recent **wars and see the
ways in which war culture** has struggled to **mediate these conflicts
to its citizens**]{.underline} and soldiers. [By drawing on the
influential discussion of the ways that dominant, residual, and emergent
cultural forms contribute to hegemonic cultural periods or historical
conjunctures]{.underline} by Raymond Williams (1977), [we can gain some
traction on the slippery terrain of our war culture. Recent
**representations for domestic consumption** have tended to **emphasize
high tech warfare, paramilitary special forces, and trauma as the
dominant lenses for understanding the conflicts**. Alongside these
dominant modes of comprehending war, the period has also seen the
powerful emergence and normalization of images of bodily torture, of
embedded reportage, and of the sacralization of veterans. Compared with
the power of these dominant and emergent imaginaries, traditional
panoramic representations of war]{.underline}, familiar [from World War
I, World War II, or even the Cold War---like coherent historical, "big
picture" narratives of war---have become residual ways of representing
conflict]{.underline}. Instead of the persuasive ideological narratives
of "the good war" or the "the struggle against Communism," we have "the
forever war" and the "forgotten war." [One of the dominant tropes is
provided by the imaginary of high tech warfare, waged chiefly through US
air power]{.underline}: the "shock and awe" bombing of Baghdad; the use
of "precision" airstrikes; camera footage from helicopter gunships;
drones assassinating enemy combatants with Hellfire missiles; [satellite
imagery of distant battle zones]{.underline}. [This seductive imaginary
for the American way of war emerged forcefully during the]{.underline}
1991 [Gulf War, in the mediatized spectacle of helicopter and warplane
gun camera footage and endlessly replayed loops of video shot from
cruise missiles and tank and bunker busting bombs just before the moment
of impact. **The projection of warfare as high tech media spectacle had
reached its apogee**]{.underline}. Perhaps appropriately, given its
limited duration, the most powerful responses to the mediatized version
of the 1991 Gulf War were satirical, like Jean Baudrillard's Swiftian
critique, The Gulf War Did Not Take Place (1991), David O. Russell's
imperial romance, Three Kings (1999), Anthony Swofford's enormously
influential and caustic memoir, Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the
Gulf War and Other Battles (2003), or Gabe Hudson's often outrageous
short story collection, Dear Mr. President (2003). In the best
traditions of satire, these [representations of the]{.underline} 1991
[Gulf War]{.underline} frequently [emphasize the]{.underline} newness,
shock, and [discontinuity of]{.underline} that [conflict in order to
contest claims that it provided **a** hygienic, **precise mode of
postmodern warfare that had finally**]{.underline} (as President George
H. W. Bush declared to US troops in March 1991) **[exorcized the ghosts
of Vietnam]{.underline}** (Bush 1991). As Stacey Peebles has
compellingly argued, literary **[representations]{.underline}** of both
the Gulf War and the Iraq war [**continue to be** powerfully **shaped
by**]{.underline} writers' immersion in ["**the digital
battlefield**]{.underline}" (2011). By the time of the "shock and awe"
bombing of Baghdad in March 2003, [these images of violent spectacle
were embedded in the public consciousness along with the mythology of
hygienic "precision" bombing. High tech rhetoric became a constant
feature of]{.underline} Secretary of Defense Donald [Rumsfeld's press
briefings]{.underline}, as he warded off comparisons between the
"decapitation strike" bombing of Baghdad with the area bombing of German
and Japanese cities in World War II: [The care that goes into it, the
humanity that goes into it, to see that military targets are destroyed,
to be sure, but that it's done in a way, and in a manner, and in a
direction and with the a weapon that is appropriate to that very
particularized target]{.underline}. And I think the comparison is
unfortunate and inaccurate. And I think that will be the case when
ground truth is achieved. (Rumsfeld 2003) Despite Rumsfeld's flamboyant
postmodern rhetoric, the "shock and awe" campaign drew on a longer
history both of colonial air power and World War II--era bombing
campaigns (Tanaka and Young 2010; Crowder 2003). [Accompanying tropes of
high technology warfare are the representations of special forces and
elite paramilitary warfare as the dominant human and physical embodiment
of US military power]{.underline}. Already familiar to television
audiences at home through obligatory sequences of anonymous, masked SWAT
teams accompanying the detectives on raids in the Law and Order
franchise, Miami: CSI, and in the post-Vietnam rise of paramilitary
popular culture (Gibson 1994), the US special forces emerged into the
public eye during the media spectacle of the rescue of Jessica Lynch on
April 1, 2003. Their reputation and popularity as a paramilitary elite
survived the subsequent media controversy, and has remained a consistent
source of patriotic pride and media attention despite the travails of
the US military during the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. They
once again received prominence for the role Navy Seal Team Six played in
the May 2011 raid in Pakistan, which killed Osama Bin Laden. And they
featured prominently in the 2012 State of the Union speech, in which
President Obama announced, "One of my proudest possessions is the flag
that the SEAL Team took with them on the mission to get bin Laden"
(Obama 2012). The representations of Navy Seal operators or special
forces soldiers in films like Zero Dark Thirty (2012), Captain Phillips
(2013), or American Sniper (2014), like the best-selling memoirs by
former Navy Seals, present the US military as an elite, hypermasculine
cadre with unrivalled expertise: fast, precise, self-effacing,
self-sacrificing, laconic, likeable, typically Southern and blue collar,
and ever ready to project lethal violence anywhere in the world in a
matter of moments. In Klaus Theweleit's terms, they represent a powerful
re-armoring of the body against the threatening flows of enemy violence
and the traumas of combat that he analyzed in veterans of World War I
(Theweleit 1989). In contrast, [contemporary **representations project
the world as a potential war zone menaced by the threat of terrorism, in
which the normal rule of law** or rules of war **can be** dramatically
**suspended at any moment**. Like the drones and mythical special
forces, **these dominant representations** of war **are permanently on
standby, ready to be dispatched into the battlefields of our
imaginations at the push of a button** or the issue of an order. This
celebration of hypermasculinity]{.underline}, albeit in the guise of the
"trauma-hero," [is also a reminder]{.underline} that the past decade and
a half has also seen a continuation [of the powerful logic of
remasculinization that followed the US defeat in Vietnam]{.underline}
(Jeffords 1989; Scranton 2015). [**This projection of military force at
a distance** is frequently **represented as futuristic** in its use of
"precision" bombing, paramilitary special forces, counterinsurgency
warfare, or drone strikes, **as if inhabiting a temporality** somehow
**different from previous forms of warfare** and from the more barbaric
or primitive violence of the "enemy." This fetishization of militarized
forms of technology meshes with and **reinforces the aestheticization of
violence,** since **it engages in a linguistic redescription of killing
and wounding**]{.underline}, to use Elaine Scarry's invaluable terms
(1985), but [this time redescribed in terms of technology. These
dominant images for wars that have seized the collective imagination
continue to offer the traditional satisfactions of modern war culture:
**they claim to give citizens at home intimate knowledge of** the
**warzones, projecting a** commanding **perspective of the conflict in
which we can share**. Yet]{.underline} unlike the panoramic vision of
Churchill's speeches or of World War II propaganda, [these are delivered
as strategic fantasies: as spectacle mediated through our superior
technologies of violence and surveillance and the stable, omnipotent
tactical perspective of paramilitary special forces. Yet if the
imaginary of high tech "power projection" continues to fascinate and
beguile, it leaves out vast territories of the human experience of war,
especially the day-to-day monotony of military occupation into which the
unpredictable violence of combat can suddenly erupt. **It misdirects our
attention onto particular sites of militarism, which** now **include the
virtual sites of digital media, as if they define** the larger, more
diffusely **militarized war culture**]{.underline}. As Geyer points out,
**[concentrating on "sites" risks distracting us from the social
processes of militarization]{.underline}** (Geyer 1989, 78). [It also
tends to produce overly static inventories of particular media or genres
during wartime. The result can be an overemphasis on the role of
technology]{.underline} and social media [in the transformation of
recent war culture, which risks neglecting the powerful continuities
between the "shock and awe" high tech imaginary of contemporary
conflicts and the official war culture and propaganda of earlier
twentieth-century conflicts.]{.underline}

### Link -- Drones 

#### Debates around the ethicality and international legality of drone violence ignore how the methods of distanced, technological violence point to the veritable retreat of liberalism and thus liberal violence from zones of conflict and instability. 

**Evans '16** (Brad, political philosopher, critical theorist and
writer - Chairperson in Political Violence & Aesthetics at the
University of Bath, "Liberal violence: from the Benjaminian divine to
the angels of history", Theory and Event, 19:1, p23-24)

[The liberal wars of the past decade have been premised on two notable
claims to superiority]{.underline}. The first was premised on [the logic
of technology where it was assumed that high-tech sophistry could
replace the need to suffer casualties. The second was]{.underline}
premised upon a more humanitarian ethos, which [demanded local knowledge
and engagement with dangerous populations]{.underline}. [The
narcissistic violence of the Global War on Terror has put this secondary
vision into lasting crises as the violence of liberal encounter has
fatefully exposed any universal commitment to rights and
justice]{.underline}. Not only did we appear to be the principle authors
of violence, thereby challenging the notion that underdevelopment was
the true cause of planetary endangerment, populations within liberal
societies have lost faith in worldly responsibilities. Metaphysical
hubris displaced by a catastrophic reasoning that quite literally places
us at the point of extinction. [Violence as such has assumed
non-locatable forms as liberalism is coming to terms with the limits to
its territorial will to rule. Physically separated from a world it no
longer understands, it is now left to the digital and technological
recoupment of distance to shape worldly relations with little concern
for human relations]{.underline}. [Drone violence is particularly
revealing of this shift in the liberal worldview.]{.underline} While the
first recorded drone strike was authorised by President George Bush in
Pakistan on 18th June 2004, it has been during the Presidency of Obama
that the [use of the technology has become the more favoured method for
dealing with recalcitrant elements in the global
borderlands.]{.underline} Indeed, it seems, whilst the Bush
administration favoured extraordinary rendition, detention and torture,
the Obama policy for preventing the growth of inmates in camps such as
Guantanamo has been their execution. [Hence inhumane torture and
barbarity replaced by the more dignified and considerate method of
targeted assassination!]{.underline} [While debates on drone violence
tend to centre on questions its legality, especially whether it fits
within established rules of war, little attention is given to the wider
political moment and how the violence points to the changing nature of
liberal power and its veritable retreat from the world of
people.]{.underline} Whereas Bush and Blair launched a one-sided
territorial assault on Iraq and Afghanistan in order to promote
\'civilisation\', Obama has waged his war in the deregulated atmospheric
shadows where [technological supremacy allows for the continuation of
uninhibited forms of violence, while addressing the fact that the
previous interventions failed by any given measure.]{.underline} Hence,
this time, out of respect for public sensibilities a \'precise\' or
\'surgical\' form of violence is delivered remotely to its distant
adversaries. [We should not forget however that the technologies,
infrastructures and aesthetics essential for remote warfare are
essentially the same as those that support the economy and consumer
society. Targeted drone-strikes and the advertising that maintains the
consumer hothouse essentially rely on the same computer-based
technologies and algorithmic sense-making tools.]{.underline} Put
another way, [how Amazon mechanically predicts your next book purchase
is not fundamentally different from how adversarial behavioural patterns
are isolated in authoring a signature-kill.]{.underline} [Drone
technologies are not simply a new tool of warfare that allow for legal
or strategic reassessment. They are paradigmatic to the contemporary
stages of liberal rule.]{.underline} As technological advance
compensates for the "soldiers on the ground" militaristic retreat, [they
further radicalise the very idea of the territorial front
line]{.underline} such that any Schmittean notion of inside/outside
appears like some arcane remnant of an out-dated past. What takes its
place is an atmospheric gaze that further eviscerates the human. From
the perspective of violence, [displacing the primacy of human agency
from the act of killing represents more than the realisation of the
military's dream of zero casualties. It reveals more fully the dominance
of dystopian realism as the defining rationality shaping the political
landscape in the here and now, and beyond]{.underline}52. [Demanding
then of a new conceptual vocabulary that allows us to critique what
happens when violence is neither orderly nor progressive, but is simply
tasked to mitigate the demise liberal power and ambition in an uncertain
world seems more pressing than ever.]{.underline}

### Link -- Drones 

#### Legal debates about drones normalizes the virtuality of war -- the aff will be circumvented by the military industrial complex

**Gregory '11** (Derek Gregory, Peter Wall Distinguished Professor of
Geography at the University of British Colombia in Vancouver, 2011,
"From a View to a Kill: Drones and Late Modern War," *Theory, Culture &
Society* Volume 28 Numbers 7-8)

[ADVANCED MILITARIES like to boast that their conduct of war has become
surgical, sensitive and scrupulous]{.underline} (Gregory, 2010a). [The
development of a precision-strike capability, the cultural turn towards
a counterinsurgency that places the local population at the centre of
its operations, and the refinement of the legal armature that regulates
armed conflict have all contributed to the celebration of]{.underline}
what Der Derian (2009) calls '[virtuous war'. At its heart]{.underline},
he argues, [is the technical ability and ethical imperative to threaten
and, if necessary, actualize violence from a distance -- with no or
minimal casualties]{.underline}. [Using networked information and
virtual technologies to bring 'there' here in near-real time and with
near-verisimilitude, virtuous war exercises a comparative as well as
strategic advantage for the digitally advanced.]{.underline} Along with
time (as in the sense of tempo) as the fourth dimension, [virtuality has
become the 'fifth dimension' of US global hegemony]{.underline}. (2009:
xxi) And [at the heart of the ascent of war from the virtual to the
virtuous are the drone wars being waged by the USA in the global
borderlands]{.underline}.1 Two qualifications are immediately necessary.
First, remotely piloted aircraft have been used since the First World
War, assault drones were deployed in the closing stages of the Second
World War, and the first major combat use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) was during the Vietnam War, so [there is a considerable history
behind today's remote operations in the borderlands. There it intersects
with the exercise of a profoundly colonial modality of air
power.]{.underline} The British invented aerial counterinsurgency on the
North West Frontier with Afghanistan and in Iraq (Mesopotamia) in the
1920s (Omissi, 1990; Satia, 2008, 2009), and for all the technical
advances there are numerous dispiriting parallels between then and now.
[Perhaps the most telling is the repeated insistence that air attacks
are counterproductive]{.underline}. Two commentators closely identified
with the new US counterinsurgency doctrine insist that 'expanding or
even continuing the drone war \[in Pakistan\] would be a mistake'. They
explain: While violent extremists may be unpopular, for a frightened
population they seem less ominous than a faceless enemy that wages war
from afar and often kills more civilians than militants. \... [\[E\]very
one of these dead noncombatants represents an alienated family, a new
desire for revenge, and more recruits for a militant
movement]{.underline} that has grown exponentially even as drone strikes
have increased. (Kilcullen and Exum, 2009) Colonel F.S. Keen said much
the same of the bombing of Pashtun villages on the North West Frontier
in 1923: 'By driving the inhabitants of the bombarded area from their
homes in a state of exasperation, dispersing them among neighbouring
clans and tribes with hatred in their hearts at what they consider
''unfair'' methods of warfare', he wrote, these attacks 'bring about the
exact political results which it is so important in our own interests to
avoid, viz., the permanent embitterment and alienation of the frontier
tribes' (Keen, 1923: 400; see also Roe, 2008). As my parallel suggests
-- and this is the second qualification -- [the modern debate has
focused on the covert war waged by CIA-operated drones in the Federally
Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan]{.underline}. The campaign was
initiated by President George W. Bush in 2004, and by the end of 2008
there had been 46 strikes directed at killing so-called 'High Value
Targets'. The attacks were ramped up by Obama, and by the end of 2010
there had been another 170 strikes.2 These operations raise complex and
troubling legal questions, not least because the United States is not at
war with Pakistan. [On one side are those who defend the strikes as
limited and legitimate acts of self-defense against attacks from the
Taliban who seek sanctuary across the border and also as an effective
counterterrorism tactic against al-Qaeda. Indeed, Anderson describes
'perfect war', the very summit of 'virtuous war', as 'target selection
perfected to the point of assassination', a doctrine for which drones
have become the weapon of choice]{.underline} ('the only game in town',
according to the Director of the CIA) (see, for example, Anderson, 2009;
Paust, 2009). [On the other side are critics who insist that such
targeting, however 'precise', amounts to extra-judicial killing, and
that if civilian agencies like the CIA conduct military operations then
their agents become unlawful combatants. Their objections also fasten on
the spatiality of the war zone: they draw special attention to the
imprecise legal delineation of the 'global battlespace' invoked by the
United States and to the lack of accountability for civilian
casualties]{.underline} (see, for example, O'Connell, 2009; Rogers,

that the use of UAVs]{.underline} by the United States Air Force (USAF)
and its military allies in Afghanistan -- including Britain and Canada
-- [is unproblematic, and in doing so they reinforce the claim that
these new technologies enable advanced militaries to conduct 'virtuous
war'. This]{.underline} article [seeks to interrogate those assumptions,
but I have to note that it is not easy to disentangle one campaign from
the other.]{.underline} Some commentators have suggested that the USAF
is involved to varying degrees in the CIA strikes, but in any case the
Air Force uses the Pentagon's Joint Integrated Prioritized Target List
to conduct its own strikes on leaders of the Taliban and others who may
have only a proximate relation to the war in Afghanistan, and makes no
secret of the fact that [a prime function of its Predators and Reapers
is to 'put warheads on foreheads']{.underline} (Mulrine, 2008) (Figure

### Link -- Global/Local 

#### Simplistic focus on the dominating (or imperial) nature of arm sales is inadequate and only manufactures more violence, we must understand the everyday aspect of hypermasculine and racialized logics of military arms that reinforce a disconnect between military action and suffering outside of state borders to effectively challenge US military interventions and violence

**Basham '18** (Victoria, Reader, Senior Lecturer of International
Relations at Cardiff University, "Liberal militarism as insecurity,
desire and ambivalence: Gender, race and the everyday geopolitics of
war" Militarism and security: Dialogue, possibilities and limits, 2018,

[Reading Cameron's call to arms through a lens attentive to its gendered
and racialized logics reveals other ways in which the]{.underline}
British [liberal state justifies its military interventions and its
maintenance of military 'capabilities'. Cameron's extensive knowledge
and detail about the military's 'big boys' toys' echoes a longstanding
'popular masculine pleasure-culture of war']{.underline} (Dawson, 1994:
3--4), [through which association with war and its technologies confers
a 'virile prestige' on men, including politicians]{.underline} (Cohn,
1987; Kimmel, 2004; Prügl, 2003). [His invocation of the UK's moral
responsibility to its allies also betrays what Young (2003) has called a
'logic of masculinist protection' whereby liberal states take on the
traditionally masculine role of protector]{.underline}. This role for
liberal states cannot be one of simplistic domination, [no matter how
(militarily) strong a state may be. Instead, it can be cast as
chivalrous, self-sacrificing and responsibly masculine in valiantly
facing the dangers of the world.]{.underline} At the same time, while
other liberal states may also see themselves as supposedly failing to be
'warlike' -- and masculine 'enough in the past' (Edgerton, 2006: 1) --
Britain's peculiar history as the once imperial power par excellence
haunts its national military myth[. As a nation frequently characterized
as the former imperial power but now in decline]{.underline} (Edgerton,
2006), [its desire to engage in masculinist protection is contingent
upon particular historical and social factors, as well as its
liberalism.]{.underline} It relies on specific ideas of 'Britishness'
that betray dynamics particular to the UK. [One of these is the multiple
cultural attempts to erase colonial and postcolonial bodies from the
national story]{.underline}, which Gilroy (2005: 431) argues results
from an 'inability to process the loss' of empire, so that 'the shame
that has attended the exposure of Britain's colonial crimes' continues
to shape the 'country's embattled politics of race and nation'. For
Gilroy (2005: 437), [this allows for a seemingly endless stream of
popular revisionist histories in which 'the empire comes back through a
nostalgic filter' that casts Britain as both nation of past glories and
prime victim of the colonial history that has meant it has not been able
to preserve the (imagined) whiteness of Churchill's Britain.
Multiculturalism, as a result, has become a problem, and the arrival of
immigrants and refugees on Britain's 'shores' is increasingly
'experienced as invasive war', reinforcing the idea of a besieged island
nation]{.underline} (Gilroy, 2005: 437). These ideas certainly seem to
resonate in the embittered political struggles around the resettlement
of Syrian refugees in the UK, though [they also reflect wider liberal
logics around migration. While a clear case was made for the UK's
responsibility to bomb parts of Syria, the responsibility to resettle
Syrians fleeing from those bombs was less clear. Stressing in his call
to arms that 'Missiles may kill terrorists. But good governance kills
terrorism', Cameron (2015a: col. 1492) emphasized the need for
'immediate humanitarian support and, even more crucially, longer-term
stabilisation']{.underline}. In boasting that the UK had already
committed over £1.1 billion to this -- 'by far the largest commitment of
any European country, and second only to the United States of America'
-- he made clear that this generosity was aimed at reducing 'the need
for Syrians to attempt the perilous journey to Europe' (Cameron, 2015a:
col. 1492). [While in keeping with the wider liberal logic of
masculinist protection, the British state's concern for deterring
refugees from reaching Europe's borderlands is not about actively saving
Syrian lives, but is biopolitical; it involves letting Syrians die
through prioritizing and seeking to preserve the way of life of the
European population]{.underline} (Foucault, 2004). [Prior to early 2014,
the UK's stance on refugees was to 'be generous with humanitarian aid to
Syria's neighbours rather than to accept Syrian refugees for
resettlement in the UK']{.underline} (Gower and Politowski, 2016: 3).
Under mounting parliamentary (and some public) pressure, the government
established a selective policy of refuge in early 2014. However, by the
end of June 2015 only 216 people (including dependants) had come to the
UK through the scheme (Gower and Politowski, 2016). In the wake of the
Paris attacks, Cameron once again stressed the need to 'help refugees
closer to their homes' to prevent them 'having to make that terrible
journey across the Mediterranean' (Cameron, 2015b). This emphasis echoes
EU-wide border policies and practices of frequently offshoring the
policing of migration to third countries thousands of miles from EU
member-states. [Such practices are often justified by liberal states in
similarly humanitarian terms of trying to deter migrants from embarking
'on hazardous journeys towards the EU']{.underline} (EU Commission,
cited in Vaughan-Williams, 2015: 25). Many of these third countries are
less developed or have poor human rights records, however, resulting in
what Gammeltoft-Hansen (2011: 30) calls 'protection lite': 'the presence
of formal protection, but with a lower degree of certainty about the
scope and/or level of rights afforded'. [Another narrative at the centre
of]{.underline} Cameron's [call to arms also reinforces the disconnect
between military force and the suffering of others external to the UK
homeland. This is that the threat posed to the UK and to the British way
of life necessitates military action]{.underline}. In calling on
Parliament for the UK to join the airstrikes, Cameron (2015a: col. 1494,
col. 1489) claimed that throughout British history, '[the United Kingdom
has stood up to defend our values and our way of life', and stated that
the very reason for military action 'is the very direct threat that ISIL
poses to our country and to our way of life'. It follows, therefore,
that military power and security rationally go hand in hand; but this
biopolitical rationality normalizes further insecurity for Syrians,
whether through the production of more direct violence or through
further displacement. Moreover, it betrays masculinist logics that
overlook how military action and increased military spending can also
make some British citizens less secur]{.underline}e (Blanchard, 2003;
Sylvester, 1994; Tickner, 2004). [Economic trade-offs between warfare
and welfare consistently impact disproportionately on some of the most
vulnerable members of society]{.underline}, including, and in
particular, women, whose lives are shaped by 'everyday patriarchy'
(Blanchard, 2003: 1290). [War preparedness takes funds away from
domestic violence shelters, care provision for the elderly and disabled,
and general healthcare]{.underline}. [The discourses that the British
liberal state drew upon to justify its involvement in airstrikes over
Syria simultaneously utilized and concealed biopolitical, gendered and
racialized logics that enable liberal democratic state military action
and military readiness to become intelligible. Liberal militarism
becomes the solution to insecurity, despite the threat to lives at home
and abroad. However, state narratives and their reproduction in social
and political life are not the only source of liberal militarism.
Bellicose, 'hard-headed' calls to use superior military power at the
state's disposal can be co-constituted by more banal, though no less
'innocuous', forms of militarism]{.underline} (Thomas and Virchow, 2005:
27). [These are found in the stuff of everyday life]{.underline}, and it
is thus to these forms of liberal militarism that I now turn.

### Link -- Covert Ops 

#### The discourse and actions of the covert sphere maintain systems of hypermasculinity, homophobia, racialized otherizing of the East, US imperial actions, and capitalist propaganda

**Melley '12** (Timothy, Professor of English, Affiliate of American
Studies, and Director of the Humanities Center at Miami University, "The
Covert Sphere: Secrecy, Fiction, and the National Security State",
Cornell University Press, pp. 23-31)

[I have stressed the enhanced role of fi ction in the covert sphere, but
I want to be clear that the covert sphere is the sum of public discourse
about secret government. In addition to popular and "literary" fi ction,
this discourse includes histories, documentaries, journalism,
professional intelligence and diplomatic writings, unclassifi ed or
declassifi ed government documents, conspiracy theories, blog posts,
WikiLeaks, water-cooler conversations, and the book you are reading
right now.68 This body of discourse is politically and aesthetically
diverse]{.underline}. While much of it provides political support to the
National Security State, it also includes many incisive critiques.
Although popular fi lms, spy novels, television shows, comic books, and
electronic games have a large role in shaping public attitudes, I spend
many of the pages that follow on writing by Coover, DeLillo, Doctorow,
Didion, and others whose historical fi ctions of Cold War secrecy are as
illuminating as anything on the subject. [Despite the remarkable scope
and variety of covert-sphere narrative, it has several defi ning general
features. First, it is overwhelmingly white and male, both in terms of
authorship and content. Its principal popular genres]{.underline}---the
spy thriller, the western, the detective and combat narratives---[were
the crucible of Cold War hypermasculinity]{.underline}, part of what
Ellen Tyler May and Alan Nadel have both [described as a domestic
"containment culture" that mirrored the logic of U.S. foreign policy in
a gendered form of domestic hypervigilance]{.underline}.69 As Michael
Davidson and Robert Corber have so compellingly shown[, an entire
poetics of masculinity and homophobia developed in response to the
apparent dangers of enemy "penetration," "thought-control," and
subversion.]{.underline} [While rugged male agency became articulated as
a defense against creeping socialism, metaphorically "leaky" forms of
identity came under strict scrutiny: mothers were chastised for
mollycoddling their sons; women experienced extraordinary feminizing
pressures; gay and effeminate men were viewed as insuffi ciently tough
to prevent the spread of socialism, liberalism, and even
cooperation]{.underline}.70 24 Introduction This spectacular intensifi
cation of traditional gender concepts has too often been viewed as a
"mere" cultural effect of "real" political confl ict. But as Amy Kaplan
notes, [the already-gendered relation of the (masculine) geopolitical to
the (feminine) cultural sphere is what produces the erroneous assumption
that real geopolitical confl ict is always the cause, and not the
effect, of "mere" domestic culture]{.underline}.71 It is important to
heed this warning. A number of important studies have shown that U.S.
policy was directly affected by a culture of masculinity among the
architects of the Cold War.72 [The CIA in particular was a clandestine
form of what Michael Davidson calls the "boy gang]{.underline}"---one of
the many 1950s-era insular cohorts of elite, artistically inclined
men.73 [The representations of covert action concentrate on this
priesthood through traditionally male genres and the familiar rhetoric
of a carefully bounded body that does not leak its secrets into the
public]{.underline}. More surprising, perhaps, is what this
hypermasculine imaginary suggests about the transformation of the Cold
War public sphere. As the Cold War covert sector became the arena in
which foreign policy was made, U.S. citizens were shuttled into a more
passive civic role[. By offering security in exchange for submission to
the inscrutable will of a state protector, this new social compact
placed the public in an increasingly feminized relation to a
paternalistic state. This is a signifi cant shift, for the public has
historically been associated with masculinity]{.underline}. As
Habermas's critics have often pointed out, the eighteenth-century public
sphere is a fl awed ideal because its institutions were dominated by men
of privilege. Through at least the nineteenth century, a cult of
domesticity construed the public sphere as male space and the domestic
sphere as a zone of female infl uence outside the rough-andtumble world
of political confl ict and policymaking.74 [As the Cold War state
concealed important political knowledge, however, the public
increasingly took a position "out of the know" and reliant on the
clandestine agents of the state to act in its best political
interests]{.underline}. In other words, the public sphere was tacitly
reconceived along the lines of the feminized domestic sphere. This
transformation might have provoked more notice had it not been
accompanied by the rise of a new cultural imaginary for the
contemplation of clandestine policy. [This imaginary, the covert sphere,
offered an anxious recognition of, and imaginary compensation for, the
feminization of the public sphere. The anxiety came in the nightmarish
form of brainwashed assassins, pliant citizens, and a security state run
amok; the compensation was a steady diet of masculinist
fantasy]{.underline}---heroic violence, individual agency, and rogue
bravado. The Postmodern Public Sphere 25 The compensatory fantasies of
the covert sphere are among its most powerful cultural effects, and an
entire cultural machinery is now in place to cultivate such fantasies.
An astonishing array of toys---including cameras, listening devices, and
robotic vehicles---encourage Western children, especially boys, to view
covert action as a fact of life and a privileged form of subjectivity.
[Youth fi ction not only makes "spycraft" a popular fantasy but it
normalizes the idea of foreign policy as a set of exceptions to
democracy]{.underline}. At seven years old my son selected for a school
assignment the novel NERDS: National Espionage, Rescue, and Defense
Society. This tale of a kid spy agency that is secret even to the
president of the United States begins with a portrait of "the United
States' most valuable spy," Alexander Brand: "He had saved the world on
more than a dozen occasions. He had stopped three invasions of the
United States by foreign powers. He had helped depose six dictators and
four corrupt presidents. . . . Plus, he looked awesome in a tuxedo."75
[Here, the celebration of covert action and plausible deniability is
decidedly "nonserious," allowing readers (and their parents) to laugh
off the implications of a world where U.S. agents routinely manipulate
foreign governments]{.underline}. Within the fantasy of secret agency,
as every child knows, the secret agent always has the power and moral
rectitude to compensate for the abrogation of democracy. [For the past
several decades, video gaming has offered an even richer fi eld for
compensatory fantasy]{.underline}. In hundreds of complex simulations,
these interfaces invite users to imagine that they are hardened special
operations forces engaged in dangerous foreign missions. With several
billions of dollars in sales and approaching one billion user hours, the
Activision Call of Duty series is, according to Activision CEO Bobby
Kotick, "likely to be one of the most viewed of all entertainment
experiences in modern history."76 Such entertainments not only market a
fantasy of hypermasculine combat on the frontiers of empire but also
critique the public sphere as a domestic fantasy. A trailer for Call of
Duty: Black Ops informs the viewer, over a montage of air strikes,
detonations, and small-arms fi re, "A lie is a lie. Just because they
write it down and call it history doesn't make it the truth. We live in
a world where seeing isn't believing, where only a few know what really
happened. We live in a world where everything we know is wrong." While
making an argument about the public's utter deception, the trailer
invites us to pierce the deceptive veil of the domestic sphere and enter
"the real world" of hypermasculine racialized combat, political power,
and 26 Introduction secret knowledge. Another trailer explicitly
connects this fantasy to state sovereignty and the state of exception:
"You will move without boundaries," intones the grave, bass voiceover.
"You will act above the law. You will use every means necessary to stop
the wars that are hidden from the world. And if you succeed, you will do
so without recognition because you . . . do not . . . exist."77
Activision knows that most of its players are the antithesis of the
hardened male action hero, hence a major advertising campaign for the
games---"There's a soldier in all of us"---shows civilian men, women,
and children on the simulated battlefi eld, awkwardly but
enthusiastically engaged in mortal combat. This advertisement concisely
registers the gender dynamic of the covert sphere, which invites
feminized civilians to project themselves into the hypermasculine bodies
of professional warriors. [The result is not merely a fantasy of
masculine agency but also a fantasy of citizenship in which the
middle-class descendants of "the greatest generation," safe on their
living room sofas, imagine risking their lives on behalf of a grateful
nation. Such fantasies facilitate what Susan Jeffords calls "the
remasculinization of America"---in which hair-raising combat fi ctions
resuscitate a wounded national masculinity]{.underline}---and also the
social transformation that Figure 4. In this trailer for Call of Duty:
Modern Warfare 3 a hardened special-ops veteran (Sam Worthington, right)
schools a comically inept "nOOb" (Jonah Hill, left), who is a stand-in
for the sheltered Western consumer. The trailer, like the game, allows
consumers to fantasize real citizenship through the simulation of heroic
male action. The Postmodern Public Sphere 27 Ann Douglas calls the
"feminization of American culture."78 These two social changes are in
fact part of the same general transformation in which an increasingly
passive citizenry is recompensed by the fantasies of the covert sphere.
This is why it seemed so natural to President George W. Bush to suggest
that the public respond to the events of 9/11 by visiting Disney World
and going shopping.79 The work of the post--Cold-War public is to keep
the home well stocked, recall an upbeat version of U.S. history, and not
worry its pretty little head about the grim and secret work of the
state. A second defi ning feature of covert-sphere narrative is its
organization around two rival anxieties: on the one hand, a serious
external threat to the nation; on the other, the threat of the U.S.
security state itself. In both cases, the primary object of
interest---the external enemy or the vast security apparatus
itself---tends to be seen as a source of irrationality, mystery, or
supernatural agency. Narratives dominated by a concern with external
enemies tend to enact the racialized logic Michael Rogin calls
"demonology"---the tradition of shoring up U.S. identity through a
paranoid scapegoating of Native Americans, immigrants, Communists, and
now jihadists. This dynamic is especially notable in narratives of Third
World combat, where demonology not only provides a source of national
identity and purpose but also registers the unknowability of covert
warfare. [In the massive body of work on the U.S. war in Vietnam,
Southeast Asia is routinely rendered as radically other, a site of
surreal horror where the enemy is invisible and the mission
vague]{.underline} (see chapter 3). [In such cases, the distant
frontiers of U.S. empire become a screen for the racialized projection
of Cold War epistemological uncertainty. A similar quality marks
narratives of the security state itself, which is usually depicted as a
vast, mysterious, and astonishingly powerful apparatus]{.underline}. It
is striking how many popular representations of this system depict its
negative consequences for U.S. citizens: its potential for technological
catastrophe (from Fail-Safe \[1964\] and Dr. Strangelove \[1964\]
through Eagle Eye \[2008\] and Echelon Conspiracy \[2009\]); its
labyrinth of cynical, pointless, and ultimately fatal spy games (from
The Spy Who Came in from the Cold \[1963\] through Syriana \[2005\] and
The Good Shepherd \[2006\]); its violent disregard for human rights
(from Three Days of the Condor \[1975\] through Rendition \[2007\] and
Body of Lies \[2008\]); or its wholesale undoing of democracy (Seven
Days in May \[1964\], Executive Action \[1973\], The Conversation
\[1974\], The Parallax View \[1975\], Hangmen \[1987\], The Package
\[1989\], 28 Introduction The Siege \[1998\], Enemy of the State
\[1998\], and many others). [Despite their profound anxiety about the
National Security State, these critiques are hardly rooted in solidarity
with those historically affected by U.S. intervention. They are, on the
contrary, concerned that the security state might be a danger to U.S.
citizens. Indeed, as I explain in chapter 6, one of the distinctive
features of covert-sphere melodrama is that its hero usually takes the
place of the state's enemies, doing battle with the U.S. security
apparatus in an effort to save the world. Like demonological fantasies,
these narratives are narcissistic expressions of American exceptionalism
shaped by the epistemology of the covert sphere.]{.underline} [When the
state engages covertly with a distant and inscrutable enemy, both the
state's enemies and its own methods become a source of mystery,
fascination, speculation, and anxious projection. This structure fosters
public ignorance about U.S. policy and supports the disavowal of U.S.
empire]{.underline}.80 This is one reason why there are such striking
differences between U.S. and postcolonial narratives of U.S. foreign
engagement.81 Third[, the discourse of the covert sphere]{.underline} is
marked by a general sense of epistemological uncertainty, a feeling that
Cold War secrecy has made it diffi cult to know what is true or to
narrate events as history. As Tobin Siebers writes in his compelling
study of Cold War literary criticism, the Cold War [ushered in a
generalized state of "distrust, suspicion, paranoia, and skepticism":
"It is a state that requires skepticism, and this skepticism in turn
preserves the state]{.underline}. This is the cold war effect." As a
result of these general conditions, Siebers suggests, Cold War literary
study began to describe textual "tactics, strategies, and maneuvers" and
made a "virtue of cold war paranoia" by cultivating theoretical
suspicion.82 Similar forms of skepticism are the hallmark of writing by
Pynchon, Heller, Didion, DeLillo, Mailer, Atwood, Coover, Acker,
Burroughs, and other important postmodern literary fi gures. Conspiracy
fi lms such as The Conversation, The Parallax View, and Syriana convey a
haunting sense that no amount of exposure can reveal the state's
terrifying security capabilities. [More conventional espionage plots
tend to end with a fantasy of public revelation, when their protagonists
deliver evidence to the press or testify to Congress]{.underline}
(notable cases include Three Days of the Condor, Hopscotch \[1980\], The
Package, Enemy of the State, and Green Zone \[2010\]). But even these
"heroic public sphere" narratives lavish considerable attention on the
diffi culty of discovering what is real and true. Their protagonists
uncover the The Postmodern Public Sphere 29 nature of the covert state
only through exceptional courage and heroism. As Sergeant Johnny
Gallagher puts it in the covert-ops thriller The Package, "Who the hell
knows what's real?"83 It is signifi cant that such expressions of
skepticism haunt not only postmodern historiographic metafi
ction---where confusion about reality is an aesthetic strategy---but
also more conventional forms like The Package. What does it mean that
Sergeant Gallagher's question could serve as a crude précis of
Baudrillard's "Precession of Simulacra"? [It suggests a connection
between the representation of state secrecy and postmodernism, for the
conditions of public knowledge under a regime of state secrecy generate
forms of suspicion and unknowing uncannily similar to those typically
associated with postmodern representation]{.underline}. I will turn to
this matter momentarily. [Before I do, however, I need to complicate my
account of covert-sphere fi ction by pointing to the epistemological
effect of a very different, and more literal, sort of state fi ction.
The construction of strategic fi ctions is a crucial element of
intelligence work. A "cold" war, after all, is fought substantially
through elaborate simulations and invented plots---propaganda,
psychological operations, and public deception. It is hence no accident
that the early CIA was packed with literature students and
writers]{.underline}. [When the CIA decided it "wanted a terror
campaign" against the left-wing Árbenz regime in Guatemala, as the
operative E. Howard Hunt put it, the agency hired the professional actor
David Atlee Phillips to broadcast fabricated news stories over Voice of
Liberation Radio. These stories were the stuff of pulp fi
ction]{.underline}: they falsely reported that Árbenz was meeting with
visiting Soviet offi cials, that Árbenz would soon confi ne all
sixteen-year-olds to concentration camps for "reeducation," and so on.
The CIA supplemented such operations by planting phony caches of Soviet
arms in the country (Operation WASHTUB), and it later concocted the even
more cynical Operation PBHISTORY, which planted fabricated "historical
proof " of Soviet infl uence in Guatemala.84 As many novelists have
noted, such operations require the mind of a novelist; they often
require the fabrication of imaginary characters and false documents so
rich in detail that unknowing investigators will be able to
"reconstruct" an entirely fi ctional event and believe it really
happened (see chapter 3). The Cold War archive overfl ows with such
plots. It resembles the private papers of a postmodern fabulist whose
unpublished sketches are regularly unearthed by persistent biographers.
To take merely one example, 30 Introduction after scrapping a proposal
to blow John Glenn's February 20, 1962, space fl ight out of the sky and
blame the disaster on "electronic interference on the part of the
Cubans," the Joint Chiefs of Staff formally recommended to President
Kennedy, on March 13, 1962, a campaign of fabricated domestic terrorist
attacks called "Operation Northwoods." [The goal of this false fl ag
operation was to simulate "a Communist Cuban terror campaign in Miami"
in order to provide grounds for the invasion of Cuba]{.underline}.
According to JCS documents, covert U.S. operatives would "make it appear
that Communist Cuban MiGs have destroyed a USAF aircraft over
international waters in an unprovoked attack"; detonate "plastic bombs
in carefully chosen spots" in the United States; and "\[shoot\] down a
chartered civil airliner en route from the United States to Jamaica,
Guatemala, Panama, or Venezuela." Still smarting from the 1961 debacle
of the CIA's simulated "Cuban uprising" at the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy
rejected the proposal.85 [If the Cold War state was in part a fi
ction-making machine designed to sway enemies and citizens alike, it was
also a "literary agent" and "arts patron."]{.underline} During the 1950s
and '60s, the CIA was almost certainly the largest sponsor of serious
art and literature in the Western hemisphere. As Frances Stonor Saunders
has shown, "the CIA was in effect acting as America's Ministry of
Culture" through a series of front organizations, most notably the
Congress for Cultural Freedom.86 [Over seventeen years, the CIA spent
tens of millions of dollars funding an astonishing array of journals,
exhibits, societies and other creative and critical works that projected
what it viewed as a strategically favorable view of Western liberal
capitalism]{.underline}. By 1977, the agency had underwritten the
publication of over one thousand books, including many modernist
classics, new antisocialist fi ction, and works by current and former
agency employees such as John Hunt, Peter Matthiessen, James Michener,
Howard Hunt, and William F. Buckley Jr. [As the chief of the CIA's
covert action staff explained, books were "the most important weapon of
strategic (long-range) propaganda]{.underline}." Hence the CIA developed
a way not only to "get books published for operational reasons,
regardless of commercial viability" but also to "\[stimulate\] the
writing of politically signifi cant books by unknown foreign
authors---either by directly subsidizing the author, if covert contact
is feasible, or indirectly through literary agents or publishers."87 In
short, the work of the Cold War state was quite frequently literary and
cultural work. And while this work often involved the promotion The
Postmodern Public Sphere 31 of modernism (the CIA air-dropped Eliot's
Four Quartets behind the Iron Curtain, for instance), its public effect
was oddly similar to that of postmodernism.88 Its operational goal,
after all, was often to blur the authentic and the fabricated, reality
and representation---precisely the sort of ontological confabulation
that has come to defi ne postmodernism. This is certainly not to say
that the state's work was "postmodern"---only to note that the Cold War
state made a considerable investment in transforming the conditions of
public knowledge at home and abroad. It seems more than a coincidence
that this subject would become the dominant concern of postmodern
expression---a subject I now address in detail.

### Link -- Israel Arm Sales 

#### The aff misses the point: Arms sales aren't what incentivize the Israeli state to genocide Palestinians. The ontological questions of [identity, territory, culture, existence and security]{.underline} are what provoke the never-ending conflict. The aff buys into the over-securitized mindset of Israeli justification and is therefore part of the problem.

Other"; Routledge; pgs. 135-136)

[A final example -- modern Israel -- which is testament to the
non-passage 3 of sovereignty. In particular, the drawn out
death-struggle between Israel 4 and Palestine has been marked by the
perseverance of sovereignty's 5 ontology in the fusion of violence,
religious and territorial identity, and 6 the national security
state.]{.underline} Following the election of the hard-line Ariel 7
Sharon (shadowed by the even harder-line Likud pretender Benjamin 8
Netanyahu) the conflict's worst features were reignited, with suicide
bomb- 9 ings, assassinations, and ferocious IDF operations aimed at
disabling the 40111 Palestinian authority itself[. As I argue in Chapter
3, these culminated in 1 April 2002 with 'Operation Defensive Shield',
the invasion of Palestinian 2 sovereign areas by the IDF, which saw the
shelling of towns and refugee 3 camps, mass arrests, torture, summary
executions of Palestinian 'mili- 4 tants', shootings and the systematic
destruction of houses]{.underline}. In Nablus, Jenin and Ramallah this
caused hundreds of deaths, with little impact -- until 1111 the
construction of the separation wall -- on the ability of suicide bombers
2 to shatter innocent Israeli lives.58 3 [The needs of imperial capital
have little purchase in this conflict, bar 4 a remote and confused link
with US geo-strategy. This is a struggle over 5 identity, sovereignty
and territory: one carried out not only between Arab 6 and Jew, but
between Jews themselves, and between conflicting images 7 of Zionism and
Israeli identity. Twisting through the events of this conflict 8 are
ongoing questions: How do Jews and Arabs fit into Israeli citizenship 9
and identity? What is a 'Jew'? What are the borders of Israel, and can
1011 Israel's existence accommodate the existence of a Palestinian state
or 1 indeed Palestinians themselves?59 2 In short, at the heart of this
conflict lies a profound anxiety about the 3111 existential security,
integrity and unity of Israel, and we may fear that in 4 the wake of the
violence right-wing constructions of Israeli identity are 5 becoming
more powerful.]{.underline} As a major conference on Israeli security in
6 2000, attended by a wide range of powerbrokers on the centre and
right, 7 set out: 'Israel must confront directly developments that
manifest exis- 8 tential dangers. Failure in this confrontation or an
attempt to avert it are 9 liable to lead to the demise of the Zionist
enterprise'. The Herzliya 2011Conference manifested acute anxiety about
Arab birth rates and advocated 1 the containment of such
'geo-demographic' threats through increased 2 Jewish emigration to
Israel and a settlement of the Palestinian conflict that 3 will
'preserve' a 'Jewish majority', i.e. little or no 'right of return' for
4 dispossessed Palestinians, the annexation of Jewish settlements beyond
the 5 'green line', and 'the encouragement of Jewish settlement in
demograph- 6 ically problematic regions' such as the Galilee, the
Jezreel Valley and the 7 Negev 'to prevent a contiguous Arab majority
that would bisect Israel'.60 8 [The most viable political resolution to
the conflict -- the 'two state solu- 9 tion' -- still resides in modern
sovereignty, but we face a fundamental 30111 question of how rigid and
ontologically intransigent such a solution might 1 be. How can it
accommodate difference, provide some measure of justice, 2 and promote
coexistence?]{.underline}61 The ideal is that Palestinian territory
might 3 be released from the ontological grasp of the dream of a Greater
Israel, 4 but the Herzliya conference also suggested deep division
within Israel as 5 to whether a Palestinian state should be permitted
or, if it was to be estab- 6 lished, sought ways to permanently annex
some Palestinian territory to 7 secure Israel against the 'demographic
threat'.62 The Palestinians are most 8 unlikely to accept such a
settlement, while in May 2002 the Likud voted 9 never to accept a
Palestinian state of any kind, and thus the conflict was 4011 set to
continue. [Peace could be a pyrrhic accommodation: while the irre- 1
dentist desire for Greater Israel may one day be defeated at the
negotiating 2 table or in an Israeli election, we can worry that the
exclusivist onto- 3 logical image of the Zionist state will persevere,
(in)secure behind its 'iron 4 wall', while the Palestinian nation is
born into a cauldron of hatred and injustice.]{.underline}

### Link -- Positive Peace

#### The aff perpetuates an essentialist notion of peace as the absence of direct and structural violence. This leaves intact the legitimating principle that makes cultural violence possible 

**Koopman '11** (Sara, Assistant prof of Geography at York University,
"Let's Take Peace to Pieces", Political Geography Volume 30 Issue 4)

Megoran calls for political geographers to not simply to study but to
*build* peace, and offers eight examples of ways that geographers are
already doing so -- yet these seem limited to me. There is a great deal
of work done in geography that is *for* peace if we understand peace as
more than not-war (e.g. geographies of responsibility, of solidarity, or
of struggles for the right to the city). But if peace is broad enough to
encompass all of this, is the term useful? Geographers have not seemed
to think so. Peace is not one of the 'Key Concepts in Geography'
(Holloway, Rice, & Valentine, 2003), nor even one of the 'Key Concepts
in Political Geography' (Gallaher, Dahlman, Gilmartin, Mountz, &
Shirlow, 2008) -- nor is it defined in the 'Dictionary of Human
Geography' (Gregory, Johnston, Pratt, Watts, Whatmore, 2009), nor the
'International Encyclopedia of Human Geography' (Thrift & Kitchin,
2009), nor the recent 'SAGE Handbook of Geographical Knowledge' (Agnew &
Livingstone, 2011). Peace is not to be found in the index of most
geography textbooks, even critical ones on geopolitics and political
geography ( \[Agnew et al., 2007\] and \[Ó Tuathail et al., 2006\] ). To
be fair, there would not be much for review texts to cite, for little
work has been done by geographers directly using the word peace --
though a great deal of critical geography is both about and for peace,
understood more broadly. Is it worth attaching the term peace to that
sort of work? Yes and no. [If the term peace is used but left undefined
it is too often assumed as a universal across time and place, and
sentimentally idealized as either simply not-war, or all that is
good]{.underline}. Megoran argues that peace is more than the antonym of
war, but does not speak to how the two are entangled. Life goes on in
the midst of violent conflict. Children go to school, people fall in
love -- and they organize for justice. Foucault (2003, p. 50) argues
that [war is inside peace, that war is the motor of institutions and
order. But peace too is inside war. The two are intertwined, and we
cannot understand one without the other. If ever there was a clear line
between war and peace, it is all the more blurred]{.underline}, [Gregory
(2010)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629811000667#ref_bib10)
argues, by ['late modern war', which has no clearly defined beginning or
end in place or time.]{.underline} Seeing peace and war as
all-or-nothing opposites is the sort of thinking that either makes
people give up on ever achieving peace or focus just on studying war,
thinking that all it takes for peace is to end war. [To unsettle 'peace'
by exposing how it is both portrayed and visualized, as well as
practiced and materialized, is not just an intellectual exercise but an
integral part of creating peace itself]{.underline}. I fully agree then
with Megoran that is important to question how peace is and has been
defined, though I am far more interested in how peacemakers have defined
it than how geographers have. I am afraid that Megoran himself leans to
reproducing the idea that there is one right definition of peace out
there if we just dig hard enough to find it, even as he looks at how it
has been defined differently. He gives more attention to Biblical
Studies than to Peace Studies, and implies that there is one overarching
definition of peace in the bible. Of course religion and philosophy have
been asking what peace is for millennia, but after the Second World War
the field of peace studies was formed to focus entirely on this issue.
There are now encyclopedias ( \[Cuéllar and Cho, 1999\] and \[Kurtz,
2008\] ) of the major concepts in the field. These include various sorts
of peace, from liberal to feminist to Gaia peace (Groff, 2010). Megoran
gives the breadth of the field of peace studies short shrift. Megoran
does focus on the "father" of Peace Studies: Johan Galtung, who founded
the Peace Research Institute of Oslo in 1958. [Galtung first argued that
negative peace was the absence of direct violence, i.e. bodily harm, and
positive peace was the absence of structural violence, i.e. social
structures with life-shortening consequences]{.underline}. What Megoran
fails to mention is that twenty years later [Galtung added a third type
of violence, cultural violence, i.e. the ideas used to legitimize both
direct and structural violence]{.underline}. Positive peace, Galtung
(1996) now argues, is the absence of both structural and cultural
violence. Ironically though, even in Galtung's 'positive peace' peace is
defined by what it is not. Other arguments about what peace means have
been advanced in peace studies. Goetschel and Hagmann (2009) argue that
[a 'peacebuilding consensus' has formed in diplomatic circles which uses
technocratic interpretations of positive peace that impose a top-down
liberal peace as a benevolent response funded by Western countries. They
call this 'donor peace' and argue that it is not only paternalistic but
hides an economic liberalization agenda that links peace to capitalist
development]{.underline}. Not defining peace makes it susceptible to
these uses. [They argue for re-politicizing the term by facing the
"thorny question of what peace means for different social groups in a
particular place and time"]{.underline} (2009, p. 64). Dietrich and
Sützl (1997) put forward "A Call for Many Peaces" in which they argue
that without being based in concrete places peace is simply an
abstraction, and that to argue for just 'one peace' is intellectual
violence. They imply that peace can only be conceived, and achieved, on
a small scale. I disagree that peace can only be achieved on a small
scale, but it seems clear that peace means different things at different
scales, as well as to different groups, and at different times and
places. [Peace is not the same everywhere anymore than war is. When
peace is portrayed as a mythical singular it becomes so abstract as to
be unobtainable, an issue best left to philosophers. Or perhaps it
becomes so unspecified that it is open to manipulation by politicians
and attached to violent pacification. I want to argue for taking peace
to pieces, not just by place, but also space. Peace(s) are always shaped
in and through the spaces and times through which they are made. Peace
is not a static thing, nor an endpoint, but a socio-spatial relation
that is always made and made again]{.underline} (Agnew, 2009). [Is peace
made through a network, a hierarchy, or in rooms? If we imagine peace as
something delivered by men in suits in a negotiation room, what role can
we play? If we imagine space as simply a container, what can we do to,
and in, it? To take peace to pieces requires both understanding space as
a doing, and grounded contextual definitions of peace.]{.underline} This
has become particularly clear to me in my own research on international
protective accompaniers in Colombia (Koopman, 2011). Accompaniers are
generally people with citizenship privilege (i.e., from North America
and Europe) who, as they put it, 'make space for peace' by walking
alongside Colombian peacemakers who are under threat. I have been
discussing with accompaniers their practices and productions of space,
how these use privilege, and how they understand that their work
produces peace. Accompaniment is a very particular form of peacemaking,
but I want to learn from different, as [McConnell and Williams (in
press)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629811000667#ref_bib18)
put it, situated knowledges of peace. [They call for geographers to
research more "sites and scales, to show how peace is differentially
constructed, materialized and interpreted through space and time".
Geographers are particularly well placed to connect the various
experiences and experiments in peacemaking around the world in
'non-innocent conversations]{.underline}' (Haraway, 1992) [that
acknowledge that peace(s) are shaped by the spaces they are made in. As
geographers we can draw counter-topographical contour lines]{.underline}
(Katz, 2001) [that see connections and weave the peace(s)
together.]{.underline} But do these experiments have to actually use the
word 'peace'? Williams and McConnell (in press) "propose a more
expansive and critical focus around 'peace-full' concepts such as
tolerance, friendship, hope, reconciliation, justice, humanitarianism,
cosmopolitanism, resistance, solidarity, hospitality, care and empathy".
But do these words stand in for peace? [The terms human rights, human
security, and human development likewise are used instead of
peace.]{.underline} Perhaps this is because the term peace can be vague,
broad, amorphous and mythical. So then is it worth using the term peace?
I want to argue that it is, *if* we define it as more than not-war, and
always in grounded contextual ways. Rather than using it *instead* of
other terms, I want to argue for adding it to existing conversations.
Though it overlaps, it is a wider concept than justice or security or
solidarity -- one that can encompass these and more. Using the term
peace also allows for a different sort of thinking. [Security is
traditionally understood to be kept at the national scale, and human
security is measured at the individual scale, but generally understood
to be kept by nations, IGOs and NGOs. Peace, meanwhile, can be
experienced as both intimate and global. Peace can be created at an
individual, family, neighborhood, community, and other scales, and using
the term can foster seeing these scales as intertwined and mutually
constitutive. One of the best ways we can work *for* peace is to
recognize that much of what critical geographers are already looking at
is *about* peacemaking, broadly understood. Using the term peace, even
with various definitions of the term, allows us to connect these
peacemaking projects around the world. As geographers we are well placed
not only to take peace to pieces, but also to connect the
peace(s).]{.underline}

### Link---Problem-Solution 

#### Arms control is integrally linked to the military industrial complex through its promotion of sovereign rule in its ability to manage force. Reject the aff's problem solving methodology that justifies technomanagerial logic and the acceptability of war. 

**Krause '11** (Keith Krause (2011) Leashing the Dogs of War: Arms
Control from Sovereignty to Governmentality\*, Contemporary Security
Policy, 32:1, 20-39, DOI: 10.1080/13523260.2011.556823,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2011.556823>)

So what remains is a set of formal arms control agreements, mostly
bilateral, but also a few that were multilateral, designed to manage the
potentially most dangerous and destabilizing aspects of inter-state
conflict dynamics. [They channeled the confrontation between the
superpowers into a technical and problem-solving logic that would
facilitate decision making about what kinds of weapons to produce and
deploy, and under what circumstances to use them.]{.underline} In
addition, after some of the conceptual confusions of early nuclear
strategy (such as Massive Retaliation), [arms control became part of the
logic by which decisions over appropriate (rational) strategies could be
designe]{.underline}d. In the 1960s and 1970s, in context of the
East-West conflict and nuclear proliferation, maintaining the conditions
of stable deterrence and reducing the risk of war was perhaps a
politically and normatively laudable goal. [But arms control was thus
also linked to deterrence theory and practice, and to the entire
functioning of the so-called military-industrial complex, and not
something distinct and in opposition to it]{.underline}. This vision
would not necessarily be accepted by those -- such as researchers at the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and other
think-tanks -- who saw themselves as growing out of the peace and
anti-nuclear weapons movements, but I ARMS CONTROL FROM SOVEREIGNTY TO
GOVERNMENTALITY 25 think the policy acceptability of SIPRI's work (for
example) came precisely from its progressive acceptance of the
underlying rules of the game.19 What were these rules of the game? There
are four elements of the Cold War practice of arms control that warrant
a deeper exploration in order to illustrate the normalizing and
sovereign logic of arms control. [The first element was the attempt by
proponents of arms control to distinguish it from advocacy of
disarmament in any form. Disarmament was associated with the failed
attempts to negotiate reductions in armaments during the interwar
period. In the 1950s and 1960s, it was associated with the peace and
anti-nuclear movements, and was seen as the preserve of impractical
idealist efforts -- at best politically naı¨ve; at worst politically
suspect]{.underline}. As Jeffrey Larsen notes, 'in the early 1960s
international security specialists began using the term arms control in
place of the term disarmament, which they believed lacked precision and
smacked of utopianism. The seminal books on arms control published in
that era all referred to this semantic problem'.20 [So arms control was
presented by its practitioners as directed towards controlling or
regulating the numbers, types, deployment or use of certain types or
quantities of arms, and disarmament was defined as involving the
reduction or the elimination of particular weapons and weapons systems,
and/or foreswearing of acquisition of new weapons]{.underline}.21
Although occasionally agreements were signed that did eliminate weapons
systems or particular classes of weapons, most notably the 1987
Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty that eliminated an entire class
of nuclear weapons, when seen as part of the broader spectrum of nuclear
capabilities, such [restrictions were tilted more towards the control
side of the equation]{.underline}.[22 Overall, arms control reinforced,
not undermined, sovereign state power. The second, related, element was
the technocratic or problem-solving orientation of arms control
practices. Its political acceptability came from its claim to operate
within the same policy frame as other forms of military-strategic
thinking, including of course deterrence theory and strategy,
alliance-building, and the entire militaryindustrial logic that shaped
Western (and arguably Eastern) security policy. More importantly,
however, it provided legitimacy to a counter-intuitive set of policy
prescriptions (such as leaving your own civilian population vulnerable
to nuclear attack, or revealing the equivalent of state secrets as part
of confidence-building measures).]{.underline} And finally, the
technocratic approach also was, in its strongest version, opposed to the
irrational and uncontrollable prescriptions of what, as early as
President Eisenhower, was called the military-industrial complex. High
level proponents of arms control (Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara,
for example, as well perhaps as Secretary of State Henry Kissinger),
regarded the defence establishment as unable to set limits on its threat
assessment and concomitant arms acquisitions. [They wished to subject
security policy to rational managerial techniques, including such ideas
as diminishing marginal returns to investments in new weapons,
cost-benefit analysis for weapons systems, and trade offs between
competing goals (the guns-versus-butter debate]{.underline}).23 As Henry
Kissinger is once purported to have said, 'What in the name of God is
strategic superiority? What is the significance of it, politically,
militarily, operationally, at these levels of numbers? What do you do
with it?' thus expressing his frustration with the inability of the
nuclear defense establishment to provide a rationale for its weapons
acquisition plans.24 [Even more]{.underline} 26 CONTEMPORARY SECURITY
POLICY [hawkish arms controllers subscribed to the rational calculus,
with, for example, Paul Nitze arguing, with respect to ballistic missile
defense (Star Wars), that it had to be cost effective on the margin in
order to make strategic sense.25 Arms control was thus more rational --
and promised to achieve the same national security goals (including
war-fighting dominance) at lower cost]{.underline}. But the actual
achievements of arms control negotiations, treaties and agreements are
difficult to assess, even if we use some counter-factual analysis. As
noted above, [arms control failed to stem the technological arms race,
failed to reduce spending on weapons, and perhaps played only a marginal
role in preventing a violent superpower confrontation. In all of its
forms, arms control was not a transformative paradigm -- but a
technomanagerial project.]{.underline} The transformation of inter-state
relations via either nuclear disarmament or nuclear holocaust was to be
avoided at all costs, [and the management of the superpower arms race
was a sort of via media between these two Manichean
visions.]{.underline} Parenthetically, some prominent advocates, such as
Robert McNamara, or President Barack Obama, who have argued prominently
for the complete abolition of nuclear weapons, claim implicitly or
explicitly that there is a seamless conceptual thread that goes from
arms control to nuclear disarmament, and that all that distinguishes one
from the other is the relative time horizon or degree of pragmatism of
the advocates.26 But this is both conceptually and practically unlikely
-- [if arms control is a set of techno-managerial practices fully
integrated into the Cold War logic of national security strategy, then
it is unable to make the leap to disarmament -- which involves an
entirely different idea about the place of violence in social and
political life]{.underline}. Recent debates around the ratification of
the New START treaty in late 2010 illustrated how it hardly represented
a step towards deeper nuclear reductions. The third core element of the
arms control paradigm was that the [Weberian state's monopoly over the
use of lethal force could not only be used to impose order domestically
and to create social peace but that it could also be projected outwards
to create a form of international order that reduced the risk of
violence. Just as the domestic form of the Weberian monopoly renders the
population vulnerable to the predatory state]{.underline} (so much so
that scholars such as Rudolph Rummel could argue that democide --
state-sanctioned killing of citizens -- was a greater risk than war);27
the international form also involved rendering entire populations
totally vulnerable to nuclear holocaust. In the name of national
security the very survival of the entire population could be put at
risk, through policies such as Mutual Assured Destruction or treaties
such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty[. It is difficult to
find a better example of techno-managerial logic, instrumental
rationality and the assertion of sovereign power at work. Although
perhaps an extreme example, this faith in the ability of states to
exercise restraint over the use of force, also underlay the entire
edifice of nuclear deterrence policy and strategy.]{.underline} The
final element was that [the arms control paradigm, like the much older
balance of power system, was not a mechanism for maintaining order that
eliminated war or the use of force from the international system. It
assumed that the main risk to be prevented was that of large-scale
inter-state war between great powers or the superpowers, and that a
trade-off between this risk, and the risk of (or fact of) small and
large wars, especially in the postcolonial world, was an acceptable
one.]{.underline} [The use of]{.underline} ARMS CONTROL FROM SOVEREIGNTY
TO GOVERNMENTALITY 27 [violence was either to be part of the logic of
so-called limited (nuclear) war or to be confined to the periphery, to
such places as Indochina, Angola, and Afghanistan]{.underline} (although
this was hardly peripheral to the Soviet Union). [This was analogous to
the operation of the 19th century balance of power system, which
sanctioned the partitions of Poland, the Crimean War, and so forth in
the name of maintaining systemic stability. Similarly, the logic of
limited nuclear war, as presented by scholars such as Henry Kissinger,
rested upon the assumption that the use of force could be carefully
calibrated and controlled.28 The neo-colonialist and political
implications of pushing the problem of war to the periphery are of
course clear, and one could argue that the arms control paradigm
sketched above]{.underline}, especially the treaties that stabilized the
nuclear confrontation between East and West (SALT I and II), [made
certain kinds of proxy wars more possible or acceptable by creating
escalatory fire-breaks that facilitated the relatively risk-free
provision of military assistance to client states and movements. These
fire breaks were easier to create in the global South, where American
and Russian troops managed to avoid confronting each other directly, but
less easy to create in Europe.]{.underline} The history of attempts to
achieve mutual and balanced force reductions (the 1975 name for what in
the late 1980s became the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty),
and of debates over the necessity for intermediate range and tactical
nuclear weapons in Europe, and the problem of extended deterrence (or
the nuclear umbrella) all point towards a set of tensions or
contradictions within the logic of arms control. It is not the place of
this article to demonstrate in detail how these four understandings or
elements of the arms control paradigm were instantiated in particular
Cold War arms control practices (treaties and negotiations). [It is
reasonably clear, however, that such things as the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty (NPT), which enshrined the nuclear supremacy of
the permanent five members of the UN Security Council, or the logic of
the nuclear strategy of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD), or the NATO
doctrine of first use of nuclear weapons, or the lack of any meaningful
restraint on technological innovation for nuclear weapons and delivery
systems, rested upon a deep faith in the ability of the Weberian state
to regulate and control the use of violence]{.underline}. [Some scholars
and analysts went so far as to argue that the possession of nuclear
weapons imposed -- as a sort of structural constraint -- a strong form
of rationality on state behaviour.29 Arms control efforts were simply
one part of this larger logic, and in any event were not designed to
threaten or undermine it. They were, in short, a clear expression of a
Foucauldian form of sovereign rule that reinforced the system of rule of
the contemporary state system.]{.underline}

### Link -- Weapons Optimism 

#### **The plan resets the parameters of politically feasible action and obscures structural criticism -- that sustains and sanitizes the military industrial complex** 

**Stavrianakis '19** (Anna, Professor of International Relations at the
University of Sussex. "Controlling weapons circulation in a postcolonial
militarised world," *Review of International Studies*, 45: 1, 57--76,
doi:10.1017/S0260210518000190, p. 75-76)

The [disagreements and silences]{.underline} of the ATT negotiations
[demonstrate the ways in which weapons circulation and regulation are
marked by different forms of militarism. The human security agenda has
made significant inroads to international public policy and social
science scholarship, and was an explicit driver of the ATT. While there
is much in the treaty that optimists see as having the potential to
better control the circulation of weapons, the argument put forward in
this article is that it is a mistake to see the treaty as a victory for
human security over militarism. Rather, human security has chipped away
at some of the most egregious manifestations of militarism, been silent
on others, and proved to be an accommodation with global militarism in
its various forms]{.underline}. Human security, political economy and
sovereignty came into contestation during the negotiations as
expressions of different modes of militarism. [Weapons circulation takes
places within a system: there is a world arms market (including legal
and illicit strands) marked by asymmetry, hierarchy, and transnational
practices, in which many major exporting states that claim to care about
human security, in particular European states, already participate in
regimes based on ATT-like principles]{.underline}. Those that don't, or
are ambivalent about such multilateralism -- in particular Russia and
China, and the US, respectively -- are sceptical about claims made on
the basis of human rights and IHL. [Claims to protect human security
disconnect human rights and IHL violations from these patterns of
military asymmetry and hierarchy, and generate resistance from
non-liberal suppliers and recipients]{.underline}. So [the human
security agenda rests on the assumption that international politics can
remain militarised in one way (the absence of efforts at disarmament or
tackling military spending or military asymmetry) and yet be
demilitarised in another]{.underline} (efforts to decrease the
likelihood that weapons will be used in human rights or IHL violations),
in ways that the examples discussed above suggest are untenable.
Resistance to the ATT from a significant minority of Southern states may
well be politically ugly, but needs to be understood in the context of
asymmetry in the world military order, as does US dominance of the
negotiations for a treaty to which it is a signatory but not a State
Party. In the desire to promote the spread of human security practices,
there has been little attention to why an initiative such as the ATT
might be resisted, beyond narrowly strategic or instrumental concerns or
a failure to internalise human security norms. [Thinking about modes of
militarism, and the ways in which the human security agenda has
transformed, but not necessarily diminished, militarism can help us
think more creatively, both analytically and politically, about what is
at stake. We need to understand and explain patterns of militarism
because of the paradoxical role of military power and systematic or
organised violence in international relation]{.underline}s. On the one
hand, military power has historically been fundamental to the
constitution of organised political power, be it in the form of the
state or otherwise. On the other hand, demilitarisation from current
levels and forms is a condition for improved human security. A
contraction of the influence of the "social relations, institutions and
values" of war and war preparation on social relations, institutions and
values more generally120 reduces the likelihood of violent responses to
political problems, reduces the secrecy and corruption associated with
military decisions or military involvement in the economy, and lowers
the opportunity costs associated with high levels of military spending,
to name a few reasons. But militarism has been pushed off the agenda,
precisely because it strikes at the core issues around war preparation
and the constitution of political community and political economy, and
because the maintenance of coercive capacities in the South is central
to aid donors' and Southern elites' interests, not to mention the
entrenched coercive orientation of Northern states' foreign policies.
For these reasons [a human security agenda is limited in terms of its
ability to generate more restrictive weapons transfer practices.
However, it is also deeply interested, in the sense of having political
effects. Human security has become a dominant policy
orientation]{.underline} among aid donors and NGOs, [is eminently
fundable by donors who claim the mantle of benevolence without wanting
to change their weapons transfer practices, and has been mobilised in
scholarship in pursuit of a normative project]{.underline}. While the
practical gains made by any treaty will always be partial, the more
significant ramification is that the [gains]{.underline} made in the ATT
help [set the parameters of politically feasible action, and
obscure]{.underline} some of the [core political projects that are
sustained by the circulation of weapons.]{.underline}

new media culture where movies, cartoons, comics, music vidoes, and the

messages have become important forms of influence on individuals. We
also identify and construct ourselves as social beings through the
mediation of images. This is not simply a case of people being dominated
by images, but of people seeking and obtaining pleasure through the
experience of the consumption of these images. An understanding of
contemporary culture involves a focus both on the phenomenology of
watching and the cultural form of images. 52 Consider, for example, the
increase in films infused with US militarized patriotism or the recent
obsession with Internet blogs and now videos posted on UTube from
soldiers stationed in Afghanistan. Hunt explores the political
racist/sexist currency of a cartoon circulating on the internet post9/11
of five Taliban leaders looking horrified after reading a document that
states, "To the Taliban: Give us Osama bin Laden or we'll send your
women to college". 53 I similarly encountered an image via email of
beloved cultural cartoon icon Homer Simpson in front of an American flag

soldiers listen to in order to get 'pumped up' for a mission. Hard rock,
heavy metal, and rap such as 2Pac's "Hit 'Em Up" and Drowning Pool's

surplus-obedience; we obey rather than confront."]{.underline} 56
Afghanistan [The historical production of]{.underline} particular [myths
of Afghanistan have relied on representations]{.underline} of the
country in the West [that are largely simplistic, ahistorical, and
politically motivated. Afghanistan is a]{.underline} sort of ["fuzzy
dream" for]{.underline} most in [the West: embodied in]{.underline} a
series of fabricated images of war and poverty, [de-contextualized
photos]{.underline} without names or places, [numbers and graphs
claiming statistical quantification, and disjointed]{.underline} yet
often repeated phrases and [metaphors]{.underline}. A particular mythic
representation of Afghanistan is being (and has been) proliferated in
the international community, through media, history books, foreign
policy documents, political commentators, academia, and virtually any
other body of communication. [The vigor with which particular discourses
have materialized]{.underline} since 9/11 [are representative of their
link to the]{.underline} Wests militarized '[War on Terror']{.underline}
[and]{.underline} more generally of [the]{.underline} embedded
[relationship between]{.underline} political [policies and militarized
discourses which legitimate the West's military engagement]{.underline}
and development policies. That is, [Afghanistan serves as
an]{.underline} unfortunate [example of the very real power of
discourse]{.underline} [and myth-making which affect the form that
international engagement takes; this in turn reproduces those myths in a
cycle of destructive imperial engagement. In trying to
understand]{.underline} the current political situation in
[Afghanistan]{.underline}, and in attempting to formulate international
policy in the region, [it is vital that we are aware of the dominant
narratives]{.underline} or 'myths' [that are being produced,
who]{.underline} it is that [is producing them and for what purpose, and
what is at stake in failing to interrogate them. Any policy that does
not take the role of deliberately constructed narratives and the mediums
throough which they are disseminated into account will not only continue
to replicate them]{.underline}, perhaps unknowingly, [but
any]{.underline} "securitizing", ["peacebuilding" and "development"
efforts built on these terms can never result in long-term
success.]{.underline} [The emancipatory possibilities]{.underline} [of
such a critical project]{.underline} of discourse deconstruction [lie
in]{.underline}: 1) understanding the raced/classed/gendered power
hierarchies that are their foundation; 2) [uncovering]{.underline} the
nationalized [militarization]{.underline} and the hypermasculinized and
hyperfeminized normativities that are are [embedded within these myths,
and]{.underline}; 3) [the recognition of the detrimental effect of the
West's 'myths' and configuring the reconceptualisation of policy
alternatives through its contestation. By looking critically
at]{.underline} what has become [the]{.underline} common [language
of]{.underline} [foreign engagement]{.underline} in Afghanistan, [the
foundation of historical narratives or 'myths' that perpetuate a certain
image of Afghanistan, and which]{.underline} in turn [results
in]{.underline} very particular [attitudes that imbue foreign policy,
begin to be revealed.]{.underline} I will utilize two broad (and
inextricably linked) categorizations which most accurately encapsulate
the dominant strains of discourse to help clarify how this relationship
is constructed and by thus identifying them as such attempt to de-bunk
the myths they create. These 'myths' which have become normalized and
banal in foreign policy, media, and some academic discourse I define as
the 'heroism' discourse/myth and the 'militarization' discourse/myth.
Superman and G.I. Joe "When we read the history books given to children
in the United States, it all starts with heroic adventure -- there is no
bloodshed -- and Columbus Day is a celebration." 57 [The 'heroism'
narrative can be called]{.underline} by several names: [the 'saviour
syndrome',]{.underline} "mediatically generated" or "hybrid
techno-medical" humanitarianism 58 , ["foreign aid", "humanitarian
intervention", etc.]{.underline} [This narrative constructs foreign
engagement in a region as spectacle and as prized commodities to be
admired and 'sold' to the public;]{.underline} [it constructs the West
as 'saviours' and the 'Other', in this case Afghanistan, as the victim
in need of saving, accomplished through images and tales of
passion]{.underline} and fervour [that]{.underline} often [pathologize
the other and valorize the West]{.underline}ern interveener. When the
US, with the support of the UN, bombed Afghanistan in 2001in response to
the events of September 11 th , the mission was entitled "Operation
Enduring Freedom". Today, [as reconstruction and 'peace-building'
efforts are]{.underline} underway in Afghanistan in tandem with military
operations, political conversations and media productions are [saturated
with]{.underline} calls to "win the hearts and minds" of the people of
Afghanistan and of [the necessary and benevolent role the West must play
in instilling 'freedom', 'justice' and 'democracy' in the war-torn and
poverty stricken region]{.underline}. Debrix, offers an analysis of what
he calls "the global humanitarian spectacle" to demonstrate how medical
and [humanitarian NGO's simulate "heroism, sentiment, and compassion";
medical catastrophes and civil conflicts]{.underline}, he explains,
[have]{.underline} indeed [become prized commodities for globalizing
neoliberal policies of Western states]{.underline} and international
organizations [to sell to 'myth readers':]{.underline} ["They give
Western states]{.underline} and the UN [the opportunity to put
their]{.underline} liberal [humanistic policies into
practice]{.underline}, while, for Western media, humanitarianism simply
sells". 59 [There are several repercusions of this myth]{.underline},
explains Debrix. [First,]{.underline} [this has resulted in real
humanitarian and moral issues being overlooked; Second, images are being
purged of their content]{.underline}. [Myth has thus
becom]{.underline}ing [the very real enemy of true
humanitarianism;]{.underline} that is, [we've become so inundates with
superhero mythologization of real world events that the embedded
paternalism and unrealistic goals go unnoticed]{.underline}. 60
Additionally, [this narrative reinforces a victimology of the 'Other'
and]{.underline} in fact [capitalises on it, while simultaneously hiding
the paternalistic and neo-colonialist ideologies in humanitarian
garb.]{.underline} The role of the media and consciously generated and
disseminated images is particularly pronounced here, as [passion and
spectacle are valued in the commodification of images over content and
history]{.underline}. Jean Baudrillard states "There is no possible
distinction, at the level of images and information, between the
spectacular and the symbolic, no possible distinction between the
'crime' and the crackdown". 61 The militarization narrative, in contrast
to the 'objective benevolence' of the heroism myth, utilizes constructed
and one-dimensional conceptions of militaries, security, and defense.
This narrative relies on the myth that militarization is always a useful
tool in securitization. For example: Following the NATO air strikes in
October of this year that killed at least 50 civilians and an
augmentation of Taliban suicide attacks, Afghanistan's President Hamid
Karzai called on the need for more military operations, an international
air force, and an increase in Afghan soldiers and police as mechanisms
necessary to "tackle the root causes of terrorism". 62 [Words such as
'freedom', 'democracy', 'justice', and 'women's rights' have become
permanent variables in the mantra that has been used]{.underline}
liberally and repeatedly [as part of the]{.underline} common and often
[un-stated, assumptions that intervention]{.underline} by NATO,
American, Canadian, and British forces [will improve the lives of
Afghanistan people over 'there' and increase security for us over
'here']{.underline}. Thus, as the military continues to occupy the
region, [we]{.underline} in the West [are continually told that Afghan
women]{.underline} and men [have]{.underline} now [been]{.underline}
["liberated" from an oppressive regime by the West. This is bolstered by
the assumption that the Afghan people support the US-backed
government]{.underline} and want the military there for security (That
is, that they are better off now than before). [There is a dominant
assumption that the West can "win" the "war on terror" and that military
measures in the Middle East are necessary to prevent future terrorist
attacks.]{.underline} If prospects look dim in the region, this
narrative implies the appropriate response is to increase combat troops
and artillery. Finally, [embedded in these images is the assumption that
reconstruction]{.underline}, delivery of humanitarian aid and
development [can coesist alongside military efforts to fight off
insurgents]{.underline}/terrorists [and "pacify" the
opposition]{.underline}. Thus, [reports on the increasing numbers of
casualties of the war does not appear incongruous with claims of
'peace-making' and 'development']{.underline} - therefore we must
protect it the puppet government and fight the insurgents. 6

### Link -- African Instability 

#### Securitization of Africa creates an "us" vs. "them" dichotomy that justifies violence and myopic policies

**Abrahamsen '05** (Rita Abrahamsen, Senior Lecturer in International
Politics at the University of Wales, December 2004, "Review of African
Political Economy" p. 682-683)

[Even if securitisation could be said to facilitate increased
aid]{.underline}, or to defend limited aid budgets in the face of
competing demands from various constituencies, [there are numerous
reasons to question the desirability of approaching the continent's
problems in security term]{.underline}s. While [the process of
securitisation]{.underline} does not necessarily or immediately give
rise to radically different policies, it nevertheless [has important
political and ethical implications. Most security discourses are
underpinned by an 'us vs. them' distinction and a logic of threat, and
by conceptualising and representing Africa within such a framework, the
relationship to the continent is changed in subtle, yet significant
ways. By approaching Africa as a security concern, rather than as a
developmental or humanitarian challenge, policy becomes guided by the
desire to ensure more and better security for 'us'. While better
security for Britain is presented as simultaneously providing a better
life for people in Africa, the securitisation of the continent leads to
policy responses informed by a desire to safeguard the 'here' against
the 'elsewhere'. This has potentially damaging consequences. Africa is
given a negative image, wrapped up in a politics of fear that may
contribute towards suspicion and hostility towards Africa's
peoples]{.underline}. In this way, [securitisation may contribute both
to deteriorating race relations in Britain, and help justify strict
immigration controls and asylum laws, as well as the erosion of civil
liberties in the face of perceived terrorist threats. At the same time,
securitisation serves to draw attention away from the West's
contribution to the problems of underdevelopment and 'state failure'.
Despite the attention to globalisation]{.underline} and
interconnectedness [in]{.underline} New Labour's
[discourse]{.underline}, underdevelopment, [chaos and state failure
become the expression of 'otherness', rather than an outcome and
reflection of certain deficiencies and shortcomings in contemporary
international relations between the north and the south.]{.underline}
The way in which decades of development policies advocating economic
liberalisation and state curtailment have contributed to the weakening
of the capacities and integrity of these states is overlooked, and the
West remains, in the vocabulary of the Foreign Secretary, the 'doctor'
able to both 'prevent' and 'cure' state failure Straw, 2002. [Policies
informed by this logic may perpetuate the underlying causes of 'state
failure', rather than contribute to their solution]{.underline}. It
remains to be seen how far this logic is behind the so-called Blair
Commission on Africa (see Plaut in this issue).

### Link -- Air Power 

#### The fiction of air power serves to construct a global police system that blurs the line between civilian and target---a failure to strategically reverse aerial power relations causes extinction

**Neocleous '13** (Mark, Department of Politics and History, Brunel
University, "Air power and police power", Environment and Planning D:
Society and Space 2013, volume 31, pages 578 -- 593l)

Moreover, and more pressingly, we need to understand that [from the
wider historical perspective of air power there are no civilian areas
and there are no civilians; the only logic is a police logic. As soon as
air power was created the issue was: what does this do to civilian
space?]{.underline} And, essentially, [the answer has been: 'it destroys
it'. Air power thus likewise destroys the concept of the
civilian]{.underline}. This was the major theme of the air power
literature of the 1920s, found in the work of Mitchell, Seversky,
Fuller, and all the others, but the analysis provided in The Command of
the Air by Giulio Douhet, first published in 1921, expanded in 1927, and
perhaps the first definitive account of the influence of air power on
world history, is representative: [the art of aerial
warfare]{.underline}, notes Douhet, [is the art of destroying cities, of
attacking civilians, of terrorising the population]{.underline}. In the
future, [war "will be waged essentially against the unarmed populations
of the cities and great industrial centres". There are no longer
soldiers and citizens, or combatants and noncombatants: "war is no
longer a clash between armies, but is a clash between nations, between
whole populations." Aerial bombing means war is now "total
war"]{.underline} (Douhet, 2003, pages 11; 158; 223). The major powers
fought against accepting this for some time. (Or at least, fought
against accepting it in their classic doctrine of war as a battle
between militarily industrialised nation-states; the police bombing of
colonies was entirely acceptable to them, as we have seen). But
eventually, in the course of World War 2 they conceded, and by July 1945
[a US Army assessment of strategic air power could openly state that
"there are no civilians in Japan]{.underline}" (cited in Sherry, 1987,
page 311). [This view has been maintained ever since: "There are no
innocent civilians", says US General Curtis LeMay]{.underline} (cited in
Sherry, 1987, page 287). [Recent air power literature on 'the enemy as a
system' continues this very line]{.underline}.(4) Hence, and contrary to
claims made at both ends of the political spectrum that [the recent air
attacks in Beirut and Gaza reveal "the increasing meaninglessness of the
word 'civilian' "]{.underline} (Dershowitz, 2006) or mean that [we might
be "witnessing ... the death of the idea of the civilian]{.underline}"
(Gregory, 2006, page 633), it has to be said that [any meaningful
concept of 'the civilian' was destroyed with the very invention of air
power]{.underline} (Hartigan, 1982, page 119).(5)

The point is that [seen from the perspective of air power as police
power, the use of drone technology over what some would still like to
call 'civilian spaces' was highly predictable. This allows us to make a
far more compelling argument about drones]{.underline}. For [like air
power technology in general, the drone serves as both plane and
possibility]{.underline} (Pandya, 2010, page 143). And [what becomes
possible with the drone is permanent police presence across the
territory]{.underline}. "[~~Unmanned~~ \[unstaffed\] aircraft have just
revolutionized our ability to provide a constant stare against our
enemy]{.underline}", said a senior US military official. "[Using the
all-seeing eye, you will find out who is important in a network, where
they live, where they get their support from, where their friends
are]{.underline}" (cited in Barnes, 2009). Much as this might be
important geopolitically, [with drones being capable of maintaining
nonstop surveillance of vast swathes of land and sea for so long as the
technology and fuel supplies allow, it is also nothing less than the
state's dream of a perpetual police presence across the
territory]{.underline} (Neocleous, 2000). And [it is a police presence
encapsulated by the process of colonisation, captured in the army
document "StrikeStar 2025" which speaks of the permanent presence of
UAVs in the sky as a form of "air occupation"]{.underline} (Carmichael
et al, 1996, page viii).

[Drones have been described as the perfect technology for democratic
warfare, combining]{.underline} as they do [a certain utilitarian
character with an appealing 'risk-transfer']{.underline} (Sauer and
Schoring, 2012), [but perhaps we need to think of them equally as the
perfect technology of liberal police]{.underline}. When in 1943 Disney
sought to popularise the idea of 'victory through air power', the
company probably had little idea just quite what this victory might
mean, beyond the defeat of Japan. But [if there is a victory through air
power to be had on the part of the state it is surely not merely the
defeat of a military enemy but the victory of perpetual
police]{.underline}.

### Link -- Asia Security 

#### **The aff approach to Asia promotes a hegemonic form of peace premised on globalization's ability to eliminate conflict - that perpetuates decentralized forms of intervention and environmental destruction** 

**Muto 2k** (Ichiyo, a writer on political and social affairs, and
activist engaged in the anti-war movement, international solidarity
movement, and other social movements since the 1950s. Active in the
anti-Vietnam war Beheiren movement (1965-74) and founded English
magazine AMPO in 1969, "Redefine and Practice Our Peace, Our Security,
If They Do Theirs", pgs. 137-139)

[Most of the peace movements' premises have been invalidated by the
postCold War hegemonic regime. The crisis has not disappeared, it has
become diffused. Issues of the past have not been resolved, they have
multiplied and became more complex.]{.underline} Old problems, like
nuclear armament, remain unresolved. [Nuclear deterrence is still built
into the core of the reasserted hegemony.]{.underline} The nuclear
monopoly by a few powers is challenged by large and small nations ---
new aspirants for membership in the nuclear club. Yet neither the danger
of nuclear annihilation of the whole human race, nor the likelihood of a
major world war are perceived as the central issue. Instead, freed from
the stifling effects of the Cold War regime, violent regional and other
conflicts have exploded in numerous places. They involve elite
selfinterests, ambitions, and identities, often expressed in various
fundamentalisms, some religious and others not, whereby élites seek
people's support with false claims to solutions for their problems,
which have become aggravated by processes of globalization. [Nationalism
has resurfaced precisely as the globalization process undermines the
basis of nation-states. The globalization process is rapidly widening
socioeconomic disparities between the powerful and rich and the
powerless and poor; it is also irreparably destroying the
environment.]{.underline} Despite their differences, [the Northern
countries that dominate this system use their power to protect their
collective interests against the vast majority of the world's people.
All this heightens the risks to the everyday lives of billions of
people, even in the absence of an apparent violent
conflict.]{.underline} Chaotic situations have arisen in major regions,
foretelling general chaos in the human community. [It is a mistake to
lay the blame for this tendency solely on "bad guys," "rogue states," or
"fanatics." Though their responsibility in specific cases should be
clearly identified, the globalization process is the major destabilizing
factor. Instead of uprooting this destabilizing force, U.S. strategy
promotes destabilization as it seeks to "shape" the world in its
interest and fashion.]{.underline} The firefighter turns out to be the
arsonist. What, then, should our stance be on the question of peace and
social justice? The United Nations Development Program's 1994 Human
Development Report introduced the concept of human security in an effort
to address the post-Cold War situation (UNDP, 1994). In an agenda item
presented to the Social Summit, the UNDP proposed a "new concept of
human security in the decades ahead." The report stated[: For too long,
the concept of security has been shaped by the potential for conflict
between states. For too long, security has been equated with the threats
to a country's border. For too long, nations have sought arms to protect
their security. For most people today, a feeling of insecurity arises
more from worries about daily life than from the dread of a cataclysmic
world event.]{.underline} Job security, income security, health
security, environmental security, security from crime --- these are the
emerging concerns of human security all over the world. As the Canadian
government characterized it (Department of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade, 1999), the UNDP's "human security" represented a
"shift in the angle of vision...an alternative way of seeing the world,
taking the people as its point of reference, rather than focusing
exclusively on the security of territory or governments." This shift in
the angle of vision is necessary and appropriate in the post-Cold War
setting. As part of a new quest for "human development" and "sustainable
development," the UNDP human security concept shifted the emphasis to
personal, economic, and social security, which, given the destructive
effects of the globalization process, certainly addresses the issues and
aspects of people's everyday lives that are totally neglected in
national security discourse. This was a significant leap forward.
However, I believe this approach overlooks crucial points and is
consequently inadequate for us to reposition ourselves vis-à-vis the
current situation concerning peace, security, and justice. An absolute
limitation stems from the fact that the UNDP is a U.N. agency consisting
of nation-states. The fatal weaknesses of the UNDP's human security seem
apparent: (1) [It is uncritical of, and thus fails to come to grips
with, the dominant statemilitary structure as a possible and often major
source of danger to people's security. If we approach the security of
people in a series of countries and territories in Asia and elsewhere,
we immediately find that the violence of national armed forces has been
directed against their own people, particularly when the latter stood up
for the fulfillment of legitimate demands --- freedom, land, labor
rights, and democracy]{.underline}. Parastate organizations struggling
to violently seize state power frequently destroy the lives of the
people whose interests they claim to protect. [This is an extension of
state violence. People have had ongoing traumatic experiences with their
own state military in Burma, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Korea, the
Philippines, Okinawa, and Thailand, to name a few]{.underline}. The UNDP
notion of "human security" is silent on this crucial issue. (2)
Similarly, the UNDP's definition of human security fails to address the
global exercise of violence that turns on the U.S. military's policing
role. It [lacks any criteria whereby we can pass judgment on the Persian
Gulf War, NATO's war against Yugoslavia, and other cases of
"humanitarian intervention.]{.underline}" Though the UNDP does not
address this, the Canadian Foreign Ministry's interpretation (mentioned
above) is worth quoting: "when conditions warrant, vigorous action in
defense of human security objectives will be necessary. [Ensuring human
security can involve the use of coercive measures, including sanctions
and military force, as in Bosnia and Kosovo"]{.underline} (Department of
Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 1999). [Are things so simple?
(3) Though the primacy of people's security in their everyday lives is
declared, the UNDP concept of human security does not tell us where the
basic power to guarantee human security lies. The assumption seems to be
that the state protects human security. In other words, the people
themselves are not identified as the primary agents in ensuring their
own security.]{.underline} Overall, the UNDP's concept of human
[security does not properly address the problematic of military forces
and societal militarization. Though the broadening of the definition of
security to cover social and economic aspects is a significant
contribution, it also serves to separate the military aspect from
socioeconomic aspects of security. In reality, these aspects are
integrated into a whole system of domination.]{.underline}

### Link -- Asteroids 

#### The threat of asteroids is a social construction used to justify militarization of the skies

**Mellor '07** (Felicity, Lecturer in Science Communication at Imperial
College London, 8/8/7, "Asteroid Research and the Legitimization of War
in Space", http://sss.sagepub.com/content/37/4/499.full.pdf)

[Since]{.underline} [the]{.underline} late [1980s,]{.underline} [a small
group of astronomers and planetary scientists has repeatedly warned of
the threat of an asteroid impacting with Earth and causing global
destruction. They foretell a large impact causing global fires, the
failure of the world's agriculture and the end of human
civilization]{.underline}. [But]{.underline}, [these scientists assure
us,]{.underline} [we live at a unique moment in history when we have the
technological means to avert disaster]{.underline}. They call for
support for dedicated astronomical surveys of near-Earth objects to
provide early warn- ing of an impactor and they have regularly met with
defence scientists to discuss new technologies to deflect any incoming
asteroids. [The scientists who have promoted the asteroid impact threat
have done so by invoking narratives of technological salvation --
stories which, like]{.underline} the Strategic Defense Initiative
([SDI]{.underline}), [promise security through a superweapon in
space]{.underline}. [The asteroid impact threat can therefore be located
within the broader cultural history of fantasies about security and
power]{.underline}, which, Bruce Franklin (1988) has argued, is
inextricably linked to the century-old idea that a new superweapon could
deliver world peace. Howard McCurdy (1997 78--82), in his study of the
ways in which the US space programme was shaped by popular culture, has
suggested that the promotion of the impact threat [can be seen as the
completion of Cold War fantasies, which had used a politics of fear to
justify space exploration.]{.underline} McCurdy highlights the align-
ment between the promotion of the impact threat and works of fiction. In
this paper, I consider the reconceptualization of asteroid science that
this alignment entailed. It is beyond the scope of this paper to give a
complete history of the sci- ence of planetary impacts. My focus is on
how a group of scientists moved from seeing impacts as significant
events in Earth history to seeing them as threatening events in the
human future -- a move from historical to futuro- logical narratives.
Nor is there space to give a full account of the empirical developments
that were used to support the construal of asteroids as a threat.
Rather, I wish to make the case that these empirical developments were
given meaning within a specific narrative context which drew civilian
astronomers into contact with defence scientists, especially those
working on SDI. A number of studies (for example, McDougall, 1985;
Forman, 1987; Kevles, 1990; DeVorkin, 1992; Leslie, 1993; Dennis, 1994)
have revealed the ways in which US research programmes and
nominally-civilian scien- tific institutions originated in military
programmes. 1 One aim of this paper is to demonstrate how
[the]{.underline} [boundary between civilian and military science is
blurred not just institutionally]{.underline}, [but also at a
fundamental conceptual level.]{.underline} The civilian scientists
discussed here followed different working prac- tices and traded in
different forms of expertise than did the defence scien- tists. They
were typically astronomers or planetary scientists who worked for NASA
or on NASA-funded research programmes at universities and private
institutes. They saw themselves as distinct from the defence scien-
tists who were typically physicists and engineers working on new weapons
systems or other technologies of national security at the Los Alamos and
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories or at armed services institu-
tions. 2 Yet the two groups came to share an interest in asteroids and
with that a set of assumptions about the nature of human society, the
role of technology and our place in outer space. As they came into
contact, their differing backgrounds meant they disagreed over a number
of issues, yet both sides pursued the collaboration despite the
tensions.

### Link -- Biodiversity 

#### Apocalyptic biodiversity narratives coopt environmental activism

**Doremus 2k** (Holly, Professor of Law, University of California at
Davis, J.D., University of California at Berkeley, Ph.D., Cornell
University, Winter, 2K, The Rhetoric and Reality of Nature Protection:
Toward a New Discourse, 57 Wash & Lee L. Rev. 11)

In recent years, [this discourse frequently has taken the form of the
ecological horror story.]{.underline} That too is no mystery. The
ecological horror story is unquestionably an attention-getter,
especially in the hands of skilled writers \[\*46\] like Carson and the
Ehrlichs. The image of the airplane earth, its wings wobbling as rivet
after rivet is carelessly popped out, is difficult to ignore. [The
apocalyptic depiction of an impending crisis of potentially dire
proportions is designed to spur the political community to quick
action.]{.underline} Furthermore, this story suggests a goal that
appeals to many nature lovers: that virtually everything must be
protected[. To reinforce this suggestion, tellers of the ecological
horror story often imply that the relative importance of various rivets
to the ecological plane cannot be determined.]{.underline} They offer
reams of data and dozens of anecdotes demonstrating the unexpected value
of apparently useless parts of nature. The moth that saved Australia
from prickly pear invasion, the scrubby Pacific yew, and the downright
unattractive leech are among the uncharismatic flora and fauna who star
in these anecdotes. n211 The moral is obvious: because we cannot be sure
which rivets are holding the plane together, saving them all is the only
sensible course. [Notwithstanding its attractions, the material
discourse in general, and the ecological horror story in particular, are
not likely to generate policies that will satisfy nature lovers. The
ecological horror story implies that there is no reason to protect
nature until catastrophe looms.]{.underline} The Ehrlichs\'
[rivet-popper account]{.underline}, for example, [presents species
simply as the (fungible) hardware holding together the ecosystem. If we
could be reasonably certain that a particular rivet was not needed to
prevent a crash, the rivet-popper story suggests that we would lose very
little by pulling it out.]{.underline} Many environmentalists, though,
would disagree. n212 Reluctant to concede such losses, tellers of the
ecological horror story highlight how close a catastrophe might be, and
how little we know about what actions might trigger one. But the
apocalyptic vision is less credible today than it seemed in the 1970s.
[Although it is clear that the earth is experiencing a mass wave of
extinctions]{.underline}, n213 [the complete elimination of life on
earth seems unlikely]{.underline}. n214 [Life is remarkably robust. Nor
is human extinction probable any time soon. Homo sapiens is adaptable to
nearly any environment. Even if the world of the future includes far
fewer species, it likely will hold people]{.underline}. n215 \[\*47\]
One response to this credibility problem tones the story down a bit,
arguing not that humans will go extinct but that ecological disruption
will bring economies, and consequently civilizations, to their knees.
n216 But this too may be overstating the case[. Most ecosystem functions
are performed by multiple species. This functional redundancy means that
a high proportion of species can be lost without precipitating a
collapse]{.underline}. n217 Another response drops the horrific ending
and returns to a more measured discourse of the many material benefits
nature provides humanity. [Even these more plausible tales, though,
suffer from an important limitation. They call for nature protection
only at a high level of generality.]{.underline} For example,
human-induced increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels may cause
rapid changes in global temperatures in the near future, with drastic
consequences for sea levels, weather patterns, and ecosystem services.
n218 Similarly, the loss of large numbers of species undoubtedly reduces
the genetic library from which we might in the future draw useful
resources. n219 But it is difficult to translate these insights into
convincing arguments against any one of the small local decisions that
contribute to the problems of global warming or biodiversity loss. n220
It is easy to argue that the material impact of any individual decision
to increase carbon emissions slightly or to destroy a small amount of
habitat will be small. [It is difficult to identify the specific straw
that will break the camel\'s back]{.underline}. Furthermore, [no
unilateral action at the]{.underline} local or even [national level can
solve these global problems. Local decisionmakers may feel paralyzed by
the scope of the problems, or may conclude that any sacrifices they
might make will go unrewarded if others do not restrain their
actions.]{.underline} In sum, at the local level at which most decisions
affecting nature are made, [the material discourse provides little
reason to save nature]{.underline}. Short of the ultimate catastrophe,
the material benefits of destructive decisions frequently will exceed
their identifiable material costs. n221

### Link - Bioterrorism 

#### Bioterror threat discourse is a self-fulfilling prophecy\-\--degrades structural violence in an incessant atmosphere of paranoia

of Bioterrorism,
http://www.cissm.umd.edu/papers/files/leitenberg_prophecy.pdf)

The meat of the book arrives in its final fifty pages. In the
penultimate chapter, Clark turns to the book's subtitle to examine ''the
politics of bioterrorism in America'' and asks, ''[How did we arrive at
our current]{.underline} national [posture regarding
bioterror]{.underline}ism?'' Answering this question should have been
given significantly more pages than the eleven Clark dedicates to it.
The answer is provided by a too-brief survey of developments between
1985 and 2001. (Presumably because it is targeted at a general reader,
the book also contains only a short reference section. If the book
appears in a second edition, it should expand the sources provided and
correct a small number of technical errors. For example, the destruction
of the U.S. BW stockpile took place in 1970 and 1971, before the 1972
signature of the BWC, not between signature in 1972 and ratification in
1975.) To explain the situation after 2001, Clark quotes terrorism
expert Bruce Hoffman: [\[Bioterror]{.underline}ism\] [was where the
funding was, and people were sticking their hands in the
pot]{.underline}. [It was the sexiest of all the]{.underline} terrorism
[threats and it was becoming a cash cow]{.underline}. [So the
threat]{.underline} of bioterrorism [became a]{.underline} kind of
[self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}. It was archetypical Washington
politics in the sense that [you generate an issue and it takes on a life
of its own.]{.underline} 29 The depiction is valid, although a bit
expressionistic, but much more substantive detail should have been
provided, such as the instrumental role of Vice President Dick Cheney,
described briefly below. Clark's final chapter, ''Assessing the
Threat,'' examines the lessons of the Rajneeshshee, Aum Shinrikyo, and
Amerithrax events and why these respectively failed or succeeded. He
again reviews the specific pathogens usually considered likely
candidates for illegitimate use and considers who might carry out a
bioterrorist attack. He compares the potential consequences of such an
event to natural disease mortality (specifically HIV/AIDS mortality in
the United States). Clark concludes: It's time . . . to refocus our
attention\*and our resources and creative energies\*more specifically
toward some of nature's own threats, rather than depending on spin-offs
from our concern about bioterrorism. . . . The social and economic
disruptions accompanying a bioterrorist attack do not even show up as a
single pixel on the screen of what will happen when the world's glaciers
are gone and sea levels have risen by twenty feet. This even-keeled
assessment is a very far cry from that reached in another 2008 book,
Bioviolence: Preventing Biological Terror and Crime, which author Barry
Kellman of DePaul University says is based on ''the realization that no
other problem facing humanity is so potentially cataclysmic and has been
so inadequately addressed.'' 30 The intellectual history of touting the
bioterrorist threat is a dubious one. It began in 1986 with an attack on
the validity of the BWC by Douglas Feith, then an assistant to Richard
Perle in President Ronald Reagan's Defense Department and more recently
undersecretary of defense for policy until August 2005. Feith introduced
the idea that advances in the microbiological sciences and the global
diffusion of the relevant technology heighten the threat of BW use.
Though advances in molecular genetics and globalization increased
drastically by 2008 in comparison to 1986, the number of states that
maintain offensive BW programs has not. And despite the global diffusion
of knowledge and technology, the threat of terrorist networks creating
BW is low. But the invocation of overly alarmist themes continues. In
2005, Tara O'Toole, chief executive officer and director of the Center
for Biosecurity at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said,
''This is not science fiction. The age of Bioterror is now.'' 31 It
hardly comes as a surprise to learn that the office of Vice President
Cheney was the driving force behind the Bush administration's emphasis
on bioterrorism. 32 But one vital point missed by Clark is that Cheney
was influenced by, among other things, the very same ''Dark Winter''
scenario with which Clark opens his book. The other influences on Cheney
were a veritable hysteria of fears and phantoms in the White House
following the 9/11 and the Amerithrax attacks, several of which
concerned the potential of terrorist use of BW and which reportedly led
Cheney to believe he might soon become a victim. 33 What must be noted
is that [although Al Qaeda's interest in BW failed]{.underline}, [the
group's efforts were]{.underline} specifically [provoked by
the]{.underline} severely [overheated discussion in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [about the imminent dangers of
bioterror]{.underline}ism. [A message from]{.underline} Ayman
[al-Zawahiri]{.underline} to his deputy on April 15, 1999,
[noted]{.underline} that ''[we only became aware of]{.underline} them
\[[BW\] when the enemy drew our attention to them by repeatedly
expressing concerns that they can be produced simply]{.underline} with
easily available materials.'' 34 (In a similar vein, terrorism expert
Brian Jenkins of the RAND Corporation has been at pains to point out
that, ''We invented nuclear terror.'') 35 [If]{.underline} in the coming
decades [we do see a successful attempt]{.underline} by a terrorist
organization [to use BW, blame for it can be]{.underline} in large part
[pinned on]{.underline} the [incessant scaremongering]{.underline} about
bioterrorism in the United States, [which has emphasized]{.underline}
and reinforced [its desirability to terrorist]{.underline}
organization[s]{.underline}. In a recent book written by former national
security advisers Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski, Scowcroft
refers to [the]{.underline} propagation of an ''[environment of
fear'']{.underline} in the United States, which Brzezinski adds has
[made us ''more susceptible to]{.underline} [demagogy'']{.underline}
which ''[distorts your sense of reality'' and ''channels]{.underline}
your [resources into areas which]{.underline} perhaps [are not of
first]{.underline} [importance]{.underline}.'' He continues: [We have
succumbed to a fearful paranoia]{.underline} that the outside world is
conspiring through its massive terrorist forces to destroy us. Is that a
real picture of the world, or is it a classic paranoia that's become
rampant and has been officially abetted? If I fault our high officials
for anything, it is for the deliberate propagation of fear. 3 I know of
no statistical survey, but warnings regarding the bioterrorist threat
have certainly been one of the major components in producing that
''environment of fear.'' A major contribution to that has been the work
of a few, very determined, and very vocal nongovernmental purveyors of
the bioterrorism threat, backed by one or two private foundations. The
Sloan Foundation has also funded at least fourteen conferences in the
United States and overseas; four of these were held by Interpol and
three by the Department of Homeland Security. 37 [Building on the fear
emerging from]{.underline} the [9/11]{.underline} and the Amerithrax
attacks, [this movement]{.underline} [has generated \$57 billion in
federal budget authority]{.underline} to date, [a large federal
bureaucracy, strong congressional advocates, multiple research
institutes and journals, and a thriving contractor industry\*the same
''stakeholders'' who now call for the continuation of efforts to
fight]{.underline} and prevent [bioterror]{.underline}ism. In October
2008, David Koplow, professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center
and a former deputy legal counsel in the Department of Defense, wrote:
It's bad enough when an important federal government program designed to
deal with a pressing national security threat turns out to be mostly a
waste of money; it's worse when that program also turns out to distract
people and agencies from the more serious and fruitful approaches to the
problem; it's worst of all if that program actually contributes to
making the problem even worse than it otherwise would be. The current
bioterrorism program, tragically, accomplishes all three of these. . . .
[\[F\]ar too little has been done to address the genuine biological
threats to Americans and to suffering people around the
world\*]{.underline}the quotidian scourges of [AIDS,
t]{.underline}u[b]{.underline}erculosis, malaria, measles, [and
cholera\*that not just ''threaten'' us in the abstract, but that
actually kill]{.underline} and incapacitate [millions]{.underline} of
people [annually]{.underline}. The most pressing public health threat to
our national well-being might be the annual surge of ordinary influenza,
but it has not benefited from the same sort of political anguish,
emergency funding, and public attention that the national security
entrepreneurs have discovered in the ever-looming fear of international
bioterrorism. . . . Bioterrorism is a serious, important danger, one
that deserves serious, focused attention. But [empowering a
bioterror]{.underline}ism-[industrial complex, and fostering a needless
climate of fear]{.underline}, paranoia, and helplessness [cannot lead to
fashioning reliable, long-term solutions.]{.underline} [Rational policy
requires]{.underline} a genuine, level-headed risk assessment, and [a
sustained, balanced approach, not a knee-jerk p]{.underline}ublic
[r]{.underline}elations [drama.]{.underline} 38 That same month, a World
Health Organization report noted that, ''Disproportionate investment in
a limited number of disease programmes considered as global priorities
in countries that are dependent on external support has diverted the
limited energies of ministries of health away from their primary role.''
39 Attempting to convince ministries of health in African countries to
make bioterrorism a primary concern, as Barry Kellman has advocated, can
only divert them further from their primary role. Nor is this a concern
only in the developing world. [Even as the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [authorized \$57 billion]{.underline} since 2001
[to defend against]{.underline} [select agents, U.S. life expectancy
stood at forty-second in the world, and child mortality ranked
twenty-ninth]{.underline}\*despite the fact that the United States
spends more on health care per person than any other country. 40

### Link -- China 

#### The aff perpetuates discourse of the imagined threatening identity of China leading to an American national identity of neorealist and neoliberal dominance while legitimizing US security policy. 

**Turner '13** (Oliver, lecturer of International Relations @ University
of Edinburgh, "\'Threatening\' China and US security: the international
politics of identity," Cambridge University Press, 39:4, 903-924)

What protagonists of [both sides of the argument
demonstrate]{.underline} in equal measure, however, is [the tendency to
assume that a single physical reality about China]{.underline} can
[be]{.underline} [determined]{.underline}. [This aim of classifying
China as a threat]{.underline} (or indeed a non-threat) [is a legacy of
the historical dominance within IR of the]{.underline} overtly
positivist [neorealist and neoliberal]{.underline} schools.8 Positivist
approaches to the discipline rely upon testable theory and empirical
analysis with the expectation that the world can be definitively under-
stood. The traditional influence of these approaches has precluded a
more wide- spread appreciation of how, in fact, a single authoritative
understanding about China is unachievable. The inherent contestability
and subjectivity of judgments about that country was once noted by John
King Fairbank who argued that '\[a\]t any given time the ''truth'' about
China is in our heads'.9 From this understanding [the
existence]{.underline} (or absence) [of a China threat cannot be
satisfactorily explained with reference to material forces alone. The
'threat']{.underline} described by Director Clapper [can never be
dispassionately observed through assessments of an external world, as he
seemingly claimed to be able to do.]{.underline} The purpose of this
article is not to speculate as to whether China 'is' or 'is not' a
threat to the United States. It does not concern itself with China's
nuclear arsenal nor dispute the existence and expansion of its
capabilities, or the possibility of there being a cause of future
violence. It argues that while the material realities of China are
important, the nature and extent of their importance is, and has always
been, regulated by ideas. Of course, the understanding that
international affairs are guided by more than the distribution of state
capabilities is not original; it has long been a primary contestation of
the 'critical', or post-positivist, [IR movement that the world is
mutually constitutive of material and ideational forces]{.underline}.10
Moreover, authors including Evelyn Goh emphasise the centrality of ideas
within Sino-US relations and to the formulation of US China policy at
key moments.11 Chengxin Pan specifically [examines the China 'threat' as
a discursive construction and its importance to Washington's relations
with Beijing]{.underline}.12 Beyond these important works
[the]{.underline} discipline remains relatively quiet on the salience of
[ideational forces in producing a fantasised China 'threat' and in
enabling US policies in response]{.underline}.13 It also broadly fails
to explain how those policies them- selves reinforce the understandings
which make them possible in the first place. This is the arena of
enquiry towards which the article is directed. It contributes to a small
but growing literature which challenges the contours of the modern day
China Threat Theory, exposing it as fundamentally flawed and even
potentially dangerous. It does this by demonstrating that, in many
respects, [today's China 'threat' to US security conforms to those which
have emerged before.]{.underline} It shows how, across the duration of
Sino-US relations, [China 'threats' have]{.underline} always
[emerged]{.underline} in part [from representation and
interpretation]{.underline} [and]{.underline} thus [how fears about that
country]{.underline} today [continue to be manufactured and engineered
in a way not unique from those of the]{.underline} (sometimes distant)
[past]{.underline}. In late 2011 the Obama administration shifted its
foreign policy focus from Afghanistan and Iraq to the Asia Pacific.14 To
a significant extent this 'pivot', as it is commonly described, is
motivated by the growth of China. Accordingly, as increasing
concentrations of US political, economic, and military recourses are
diverted to the Asian region, American perceptions of China and their
significance to the enactment of Washington's foreign policies there
have once more become increasingly pertinent. The first part of the
article has two purposes. First, it explicates how it can be argued that
[the China 'threat' to US security is a subjective representation of
American society]{.underline}. It is explained that while the 'dangers'
have an undeniable material base, [China's capabilities are attributed
ideas which produce a threatening identity regardless of Beijing's
intentions]{.underline}. Second, it examines the significance of
American representations to US China policy. It is asserted that
particular [discourses have always made true a threatening China and
enabled and legitimised policy performances in response]{.underline}. It
is also argued that [those performances]{.underline} themselves have
[reaffirmed the identities of both China and the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. As such, it is shown that [US
China policies function to protect the]{.underline} (equally [imagined
and socially constructed]{.underline}) [American identity from which the
'threat' is produced]{.underline}. The second part of the article
applies these arguments to three case studies: the mid-to-late
nineteenth century when an influx of Chinese immigrants entered the
United States; the early Cold War period following the establishment of
the People's Republic of China (PRC); and the modern day period when a
'rising' China is increasingly powerful and influential. These are the
temporal moments at which ['dangers' from China to American security
have been interpreted as the most immediate and acute.]{.underline} The
article concludes with an overview of the findings and their
implications for our understandings of, and potential approaches
towards, the modern day China 'threat' to the United States. Imagining
China: the construction of threat and political possibility In his
analysis of the China Threat Theory [Chengxin Pan argues]{.underline}
that [the 'threat' is an imagined construction of American
observers]{.underline}.15 [Pan does not deny the importance of the PRC's
capabilities but asserts that they appear threatening from
understandings about the United States itself]{.underline}. '\[T\]here
is no such thing as ''Chinese reality'' that can automatically speak for
itself', Pan argues. '\[[T]{.underline}\][o fully understand the US
''China threat'']{.underline} argument, [it is essential to recognize
its autobiographical nature']{.underline}.16 The
[geographical]{.underline} territory of [China]{.underline}, then, [is
not separate from]{.underline} or external to, [American
representations]{.underline} of it. [Rather]{.underline}, [it is
actively constitutive of those representations]{.underline}.17 [The
analysis which]{.underline} follows [demonstrates]{.underline} that
[China 'threats' to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[have]{.underline} to some extent always [been]{.underline} established
and [perpetuated through representation and discourse]{.underline}.
Michel Foucault described discourse as 'the general domain of all
statements', constituting either a group of individual statements or a
regulated practice which accounts for a number of statements.18
[American discourse of China can]{.underline} therefore be
[manifest]{.underline} as disparate and single [statements about that
country or as collectives of related statements such as the China Threat
Theory]{.underline}. Ultimately, American representations of China are
discursive constructions of truths or realities about its existence. The
article draws in part from the work of David Campbell who suggests that
dangers in the international realm are invariably threats to
understandings about the self. ['The mere existence of an alternative
mode of being]{.underline}', argues Campbell, 'the presence of which
[exemplifies that different identities are possible]{.underline} \...
[is sometimes enough to produce the understanding of a
threat]{.underline}.'19 As a result, interpretations of global danger
can be traced to the processes by which states are made foreign from one
another through discourses of separation and difference.20 In this
analysis it is demonstrated that particular American discourses have
historically made the US foreign from China. Case study one for example
demonstrates that nineteenth- century racial discourses of non-white
immigrant Chinese separated China from a United States largely defined
by its presumed Caucasian foundations. In case study two we see that
Cold War ideological discourses of communism distanced the PRC from the
democratic-capitalist US. These types of discourses are shown to have
constituted a 'specific sort of boundary producing political
performance'.21 [Across the history of Sino-US relations]{.underline}
then [when 'dangers' from China]{.underline} have [emerged]{.underline},
[they have]{.underline} always [been perceived through the lens of
American identity]{.underline}. [In consequence, they have]{.underline}
always [existed as dangers to that identity]{.underline}. In this
analysis it is argued that a key purpose of depicting China as a threat
has been to protect components of American identity (primarily racial
and ideological) deemed most fundamental to its being. As such,
[representations of a threatening China have most commonly]{.underline}
been advanced by, and [served the interests of]{.underline}, those who
support [actions to defend that identity]{.underline}. The case study
analyses which follow reveal that this has included politicians and
policymaking circles, such as those within the administration of
President Harry Truman which implemented the Cold War containment of the
PRC. It also exposes the complicity of other societal individuals and
institutions including elements of the late nineteenth-century American
media which supported restrictions against Chinese immigration to the
western United States.

### Link -- China Epistemology 

#### Furthermore, traditional China studies are epistemologically bankrupt -- they rely on a neoliberal "with us or against us" mentality which shuts down debate and ensures an academic cloister -- reject their scenarios

**Vukovich '13** (Daniel F Vukovich, associate professor of the
humanities at the University of Hong Kong, PhD in English from the
University of Illinois, 2013, "China and Orientalism: Western Knowledge
Production and the P.R.C.", pp 13-17, ableist language modified)

These two different texts, then, help illustrate the dynamic content of
Sinological-orientalism as well as its dispersion. [The critique of
orientalism has]{.underline}, however, [met with great resistance within
the China field, and almost invariably takes the form of either flat-out
dismissal or an uncomprehending caricature of Said\'s project that
renders it an "exaggerated" critique of ethnocentric bias]{.underline}.
An essay by historian Philip C. C. Huang will serve to illustrate the
non-debate and the history of the logic of sameness within China
studies. He notes that [traditional thought invariably positioned China
as the "Other]{.underline}," in that it was entirely different from the
West.27 In response to this, Huang and some others in his generation -
those in the wake of the 1949 revolution and the Cold War - took it as
their task to prove that China was just like the West after all: \[Our\]
well-intentioned efforts were perhaps motivated above all by the desire
to assert China\'s equivalence to the West\.... \[The\] only way to
counter the denigration of China as "the other" seemed to be to maintain
that it was just like the West.28 ("Theory" par. 24) Thus [Huang evinces
a tacit desire]{.underline} and theme in past scholarship: [for
equivalence or sameness]{.underline}. He implies this dynamic is no
longer dominant in China studies, but it is the argument of the present
study that it is so. Yet [this sameness has shifted in political terms.
Whereas for this earlier period the point]{.underline} (now seen by
Huang as an "emotional dictate") [was to counter a denigrating essential
difference imputed to China, in the current phase it reflects an often
explicitly neo-lib-eral and pro-Western politics]{.underline} (par. 27).
[Here the worst thing that could happen would be for China to "turn
back" and away from capitalism]{.underline}. No one mentions that this
might mean cutting off one\'s access to the field. Huang perceptively
notes that [this old approach remained as "Western-centric" as its
alternative (China as a copy of the West).]{.underline} But he follows
this up with a call for "social history" and a return to the facts;
these will show us what theories are valid. The status of the
lying-in-wait "facts" is not addressed, and [Said\'s challenges to
conventional historicism and epistemology are ignored]{.underline}.
Huang accuses Said of denying that "facts" exist prior to or beyond
representations. But [Orientalism\'s project was to present the
constructed but real discourse on its own terms, and to show that it
indexes the West more than any "Islam" or "Orient."]{.underline} And
[representations and knowledges, orientalist or otherwise, are not fake
but are social facts themselves]{.underline}. My retorts here will seem
familiar to scholars in cultural and literary studies, and this in
itself is instructive. As Ravi Palat aptly summarizes the situation:
"'Crisis' in Asian Studies denotes shortages of funds rather than an
epistemo-logical questioning of the field" (Palat 110). [Palat diagnoses
the basic dichotomy (extreme specialization/extreme generalization) and
the cult of expertise underpinning Asian studies]{.underline} (110).
This last is based in "field time" and native language-proficiency.29
These in turn provide "perfect-transparent knowledge as the only
condition for gaining access to the real" (Harootunian, History 40). For
China especially, language fluency is the sacred skeleton key, though to
be fair this is itself part of nativist Chinese thinking. One could pile
on here. There are the attacks on engaged, political scholarship from
Simon Leys to Geremie Barme and Steven Mosher.30 [One tactic is to
decide that orientalism is just self-delusional bias, and then to turn
this back onto un-named scholars who "supported" - whatever that means -
Chinese communism]{.underline}. Such were ~~blind to~~ \[ignorant of\]
the true reality of China\'s complete repression and totalitarianism.31
To be "in the true" of China studies and reportage, one has to be
critical of the past and current regime because it has not yet broken
free. Philosophical acumen, comparative and textual/interpretive skills,
or self-reflexivity are not needed. Language training and field-time
stand in for (adequate, rigorous) disciplinary and theoretical
grounding. In a presidential address to the American Association of
Asian Studies in 1980, Benjamin Schwartz responded to Said\'s book. He
defended the "objective validity" of knowledge that can be used for
"understanding in the Weberian sense."32 More to the point here is his
defensiveness about area studies and the "anti-Western" nature of
Said\'s argument. He notes that the human and natural sciences are just
as capable of being politically manipulated as orientalism and area
studies. That is correct, but misses the point that Said would agree,
and was moreover talking specifically about colonial forms of power and
intellectual culture. Note, too, that Schwarz concedes Said\'s argument
that the field of orientalism (and area studies) are "defined
canonically, imperially and geographically" and not "disciplines defined
intellectually" (Orientalism 326).33 Schwartz, however, thinks this
enables the area specialist, through comparative analysis, to see
through and steer beyond a "spurious universality\... derived from the
West" and the trap of an "ahistorical culturalism" (or relativism).34
But surely this [a false choice: comparative historicism or ahistorical
relativism.]{.underline} And the former would need anyway to deal with
the argument that comparativism smuggles in universal/Western norms and
standards of comparison.35 In the end, Schwarz recommends minor house
cleaning. We should "rid ourselves of stale categories" and seek new
"nomenclatures, some of them perhaps derived from the cultures we are
studying."36Perhaps we can use some of their terms, but let us not go
too far in a subjective direction. [The basic Saidian question is
elided: Who gets to write the Other, and how? The response to Said and
postcolonialism was from the very beginning one of
incomprehension.]{.underline} But there was Paul Cohen\'s appeal for a
"China-centered" method. He not only criticizes the Eurocentrism of past
approaches (where poor China was always responding to the West), but
also claims that Said\'s basic insight applies to China studies: One
need hardly agree with all of Said\'s strictures to accept the more
general insight that [all intellectual inquiry partakes of a kind of
'imperialism' and that the dangers of misrepresentation are greatest,
the imperialism especially virulent, when the inquirer - or more
precisely the cultural, social, or political world of which he or she is
a member - has also had some part, historically, in shaping the object
of inquiry]{.underline}. (Discovering 150) This admirably concise
distillation of Said\'s argument is followed by a conventional
alternative: "China-centered analysis" seems a plain historicism that
simply seeks to be less chauvinist and more sensitive to the Chinese
context. A decent and humane suggestion, but how? Harootunian argues
that Cohen\'s model "rejects theory out of hand for the 'facts' and thus
the authority of native knowledge and experience" ("Postcoloniality"
138). The discipline is still not defined intellectually, but
linguistically and geographically. However much we might center
ourselves in China, this nonetheless begs a lot of questions (and
endless "facts") about which China. And then there are the irreversibly
global and cross-cultural dimensions of both "China" and "the West."
Orientalism and the postcolonial turn, then, have made little impact on
the production of knowledge within the China field. That field thus
stands in sharp contrast not only to, say, anthropology or literature,
but also South Asian, African, and Latin American studies. But it is
instructive to further see how this turn has been avoided. In a series
of essays, Zhang Longxi argued that "Western theory" - he often singles
out the Palestinian Said\'s work in particular - has had a pernicious
effect within Chinese intellectual culture. Said himself noted that his
work had at times - in the Middle East - been taken up by some in
narrowly nationalist and nativist terms.37 Zhang\'s complaint is the
same, seeing the uses of Said and 'postmodern' theory as anti-Western,
politically conservative and supportive of the dreaded Communist regime.
Zhang thus equates nationalist and fundamentalist uses of Orientalism in
Arabic countries to leftist or 'anti-Western' critical intellectuals in
China. But it is hard to say what in principle is nationalist,
'nativist', or otherwise dangerous to such appropriations of Said. He
singles out Rey Chow - as anti-communist a critic as they come - for
criticizing the representation and whiteness of the Tiananmen event as
broadcast to the world from CNN. Chow\'s use of Western theory is
"misapplied" and unaware of the proper Chinese "context" in which
criticisms of democracy are by definition conservative and beyond the
pale (Zhang, 1992, 121). This appeal to the "Chinese context" and to
"Chinese reality" surfaces in other essays by Zhang Longxi, including
his criticisms of Zhang Kuan\'s influential essays on orientalism and
Western hegemony in China studies and in the mainland 1980s.38 The
critique is again based on how [Chinese reality - defined entirely by
gestures to a repressive state - is by definition different than the
Western one]{.underline}: such critical theory may be radical in the
latter case, but not in China. Yet the question of which China - that of
the middle class, the variegated intelligentsia, the urban workers, the
migrant laborers, the peasants, the national minorities, and so on
-cannot be asked. ["China" is represented by a sheer dichotomy between
anti-imperialists who turn out to be conservatives, and
pro-capitalist/Western liberals]{.underline} who turn out to be the
true, cosmopolitan voice of the people. What we have, then, are clear
battle grounds underlying the use of theory and orientalism, especially
amongst the diaspora or Western-based writers (i.e. the majority).
"[Pomo" theory is either misplaced or, if it is to be used, must be
directed against the Party-state and not in the name of
anti-imperialism, nationalism, or some other form of "pro-China"
politics]{.underline}. (From within China this often plays out in the
opposite direction.) Zhang Longxi\'s work introduced the issue of
cross-cultural analysis into Chinese literary studies, but it also is
clearly over-determined by a political agenda, even more than by its
empiricism. That is, a strident anti-communist liberalism, a project
shared by many others.39 ["Leftism" does not fit Chinese reality.
Critiques of Western hegemony]{.underline} on the part of mainland
Chinese intellectuals [must be dismissed as nativist, nationalist, and
so on]{.underline}. Thus it is the anti- anti-orientalists who seem far
too confident about what the local, mainland context means and what it
does to theory. [For such intellectuals committed in the first instance
to a largely imaginary battle with the Chinese state, it is at best
premature to inveigh against Western imperialism and colonial discourse
when what China needs first is good old (capitalist) democracy as found
in the West. This type of reason reaches its apex in the Charter 08
group]{.underline} composed of mainland liberal and neo-liberal
intellectuals, and their Euro-American scholarly cohort. [The chief
architect of the Charter is Liu]{.underline} Xiaobo, a currently
imprisoned intellectual who won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. His stakes
are far different. There is something inspiring, or at least seductive,
about the classical liberal, universalist language of the Charter (calls
for freedom of speech, protest, and so forth in the context of the
current Party-state) and in Liu\'s great personal courage. But what is
most striking for my purposes is Liu\'s unrepentant stance on China
needing "three hundred years of foreign colonization" so that it may
politically, intellectually, and culturally catch up. Moreover, [there
is the Charter\'s insistence on privatizing the remaining public
dimensions of the economy and instituting a complete system of private
property]{.underline}.40 [Its substantive economic views are
neo-liberal. Colonialism and more capitalism will bring forth
"individual freedom" and human rights in China]{.underline}. At the risk
of criticizing an unfairly imprisoned "dissident" this is an
Occidentalism, an internalized orientalism writ large. [It also follows
the logic of becoming-sameness outlined here. It is no accident that Liu
is close to several experts in the China field.]{.underline} When we
recall the colonial roots of liberal thinking, from Locke to Liu, it is
unsurprising that Zhang Longxi wants to ground cross-cultural analysis
on humanistic and explicitly depoliticized grounds ("the variety of our
world and the totality of what we may proudly call the heritage of human
culture") ("Myth" 131). One sees this same gesture in a recent boundary2
paper extolling individualism and generic humanism as the way forward
for China and the U.S.41 Later, I map a similar, de-politicizing logic
within "Sinography" - a far more "theoretical" venture - and its
disavowal of orientalism and postcolonialism. [What these diverse
figures share, then, is not simply an anti-regime stance, but a
politicized valorization of depoliticization.]{.underline}

### Link -- China Realism

#### Their application of realism to China is not just false but colonial -- their theory relies on a western drive for certainty and integration which causes mass violence

**Pan '12** (Chengxin Pan, PhD, senior lecturer in international
relations at Deakin University, November 2012, "Knowledge, Desire and
Power in Global Politics: Western Representations of China's Rise," pp
46-8, gender modified)

No doubt, [some would protest that the 'China threat' conclusion stands
on the firm ground of realism, and has nothing to do with the way the
West identifies itself]{.underline}. For example, [according to
Mearsheimer, in a world of anarchy, 'states can never be certain about
the intentions of other states']{.underline},20 [and therefore have to
treat each other as a potential threat.]{.underline} Yet, I would argue
that [such an insatiable demand for transparency from others is itself a
telltale sign of the Western quest for certainty, security, and identity
as the modern knowing subject]{.underline}. Similarly, [the realist
first-image of human nature, which is often implicitly invoked in the
explanation of the China threat, has less to do with human nature per se
than with the Western quest for scientific truth about human society.
The Hobbesian 'discovery' of the first \[hu\]man and human nature, as C.
B. Macpherson argues, was not the objective knowledge of man per se, but
rather a conscious or unconscious autobiographical reflection of Western
modern \[hu\]man and his living condition in a 'bourgeois market
society']{.underline}.21 [Insofar as the 'China threat' paradigm has
been informed partly by the Hobbesian fear of every \[hu\]man against
every \[hu\]man, this China threat representation is best seen as a
mirror image of some historically specific and selective self-experience
of the West]{.underline}. [Two specific arguments in the 'China threat'
discourse are illustrative of this point. The first is the
widely-invoked Germany analogy]{.underline}. Former US Deputy Secretary
of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, who was instrumental in the formation of
Washington's official view of China as a 'strategic competitor', 22 was
convinced by the 'obvious and disturbing analogy' between Wilhelmine
Germany and today's China. Though briefly acknowledging the differences
between the two powers, he insisted on their many 'similarities'. For
him, [just as Germany's transition from the statesmanship of Bismarck to
the incompetence of his successors contributed to the tragedy of World
War I, so too China, which is in the process of a similar transition
'from two decades of extremely skilful management of its international
relationships to a new leadership of uncertain quality', poses a serious
threat to the international order]{.underline}.23 In an influential
piece published in The National Interest, Richard Betts and Thomas
Christensen similarly argue that Like Germany a century ago, China is a
late-blooming great power emerging into a world already ordered
strategically by earlier arrivals; a continental power surrounded by
other powers who are collectively stronger but individually weaker (with
the exception of the United States and, perhaps, Japan); a bustling
country with great expectations, dissatisfied with its place in the
international pecking order, if only with regard to international
prestige and respect. The quest for a rightful "place in the sun"
will... inevitably foster growing friction with Japan, Russia, India or
the United States.24 [What this Germany analogy can tell us is that the
Western knowledge of the China threat is based, more than anything else,
on a fear of repetition of a European nightmare scenario. Its fear of
China, situated in the broader sense of paranoia that Europe's past may
become Asia's future]{.underline},25 [is derived less from China's rise
or its uncertain intentions than from the self-righteous certainty about
the universality of Western historical trajectory. The America analogy
tells a similar story. Kagan argues that 'if Americans want to
understand Chinese power and ambition today, they could start by looking
in the mirror'.]{.underline}. 26 [This is exactly what Mearsheimer has
done]{.underline}. [After extrapolating American history in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries to a status of the unchangeable
'tragedy' of great power politics in general, Mearsheimer insists that
China will have to, almost slavishly, follow the same path:]{.underline}
for sound strategic reasons, \[China\] would surely pursue regional
hegemony, just as the United States did in the Western Hemisphere during
the nineteenth century. So we would expect China to attempt to dominate
Japan and Korea, as well as other regional actors, by building military
forces that are so powerful that those other states would not dare
challenge it. We would also expect China to develop its own version of
the Monroe Doctrine, directed at the United States. Just as the United
States made it clear to distant great powers that they were not allowed
to meddle in the Western Hemisphere, China will make it clear that
American interference in Asia is unacceptable.27 [Clearly, Mearsheimer's
'China threat' assessment is based not so much on what China does in the
present as it is on what the US itself did in the past]{.underline}.28
[His repeated anxious 'expectations' of China testify to a paranoia of
both China's Otherness and its emerging sameness. His fear reflects, in
the final analysis, the lingering ambivalence of colonial desire towards
the mimicry of the American self-experience by an Oriental Other. The
autobiographical nature of the 'China threat' discourse is so obvious
that many references to the 'China menace' (such as the 'Beijing
Consensus' and 'Chinese Lake') are directly modelled on the
Western/American self. Little wonder that Mel Gurtov, while reading a
2005 US Defense Department report on China's military threat, found the
report's comments on China ironically more fitting to describe US power
and intention than China's]{.underline}.29

### Link -- China Rhetoric 

#### The deployment of the aff's rhetoric actualizes the China threat

**Pan '12** (Chengxin Pan, PhD, senior lecturer in international
relations at Deakin University, November 2012, "Knowledge, Desire and
Power in Global Politics: Western Representations of China's Rise," pp
105-7, ableist language modified)

[If changing Chinese public opinion and Beijing's growing assertiveness
in foreign policy are better understood in the context of mutual
responsiveness, then threatening as they may appear, they at least
partly reflect the self- fulfilling effect of the China threat theory as
practice]{.underline}. That is, [they are to some extent socially
constructed by Western representations of the China threat]{.underline}.
At this juncture, we may return to the question raised earlier---What's
the cost of having an enemy? The cost, simply put, is that [perceiving
China as a threat and acting upon that perception help bring that feared
China threat closer to reality]{.underline}. [Though not an objective
description of China, the 'China threat' paradigm is no mere fantasy, as
it has the constitutive power to make its prediction come true. If this
China paradigm ends up bearing some resemblance to Chinese reality, it
is because the reality is itself partly constituted by it. With US
strategic planners continuing to operate on the basis of the China
threat, this self-fulfilling process has persisted to the present
day.]{.underline} For example, [in July 2010, when China objected to the
joint US- South Korean navy exercise in the Yellow Sea to no avail, it
announced that its navy would conduct live fire drills in the East China
Sea for the duration of the US-South Korean manoeuvres]{.underline}. 129
[Meanwhile, a Global Times]{.underline} (a Chinese daily tabloid
affiliated with the official People's Daily) [editorial opines that
'Whatever harm the US military manoeuvre may have inflicted upon the
mind of the Chinese, the United States will have to pay for it, sooner
or later'.]{.underline}130 [All such Chinese 'belligerence' seems to
have provided fresh evidence to the 'China threat' paradigm, whose image
of China has now been vindicated]{.underline}.131 [Without acknowledging
their own role in the production of the 'China threat', 'China threat'
analysts thus play a key part in a spiral model of tit-for-tat in
Sino-US relations]{.underline}. Mindful of this danger, [some
cool-headed observers have warned that a US attempt to build a missile
defence shield could be reciprocated by China deploying more
missiles]{.underline}.132 Even the highly classified US National
Intelligence Estimate (NIE) report Foreign Responses to U.S. National
Missile Defense Deployment has hinted at this possibility.133 In early
2006, [Mike Moore, contributing editor of The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, predicted that if the US continues to weaponise space by
deploying a comprehensive space-control system, 'China will surely
respond']{.underline}.134 [And respond it did]{.underline}. [In early
2007, it launched a ballistic missile to destroy an inoperational
weather satellite in orbit]{.underline}. That test immediately caused a
stir in the international press, even though it came after Washington's
repeated refusal to negotiate with China and Russia over their proposed
ban on space weapons and the use of force against satellites. A
Financial Times article noted that '[What is surprising about the
Chinese test is that anyone was surprised']{.underline}.135 In a similar
vein but commenting on the broader pattern of US strategy on China over
the years, Lampton notes that '[Washington cannot simply seek to
strengthen ties with India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and central
Asian states as an explicit offset to rising Chinese power and then be
surprised when Beijing plays the same game']{.underline}.136
Nevertheless, [such surprise is commonplace in the China watching
community, reflecting an intellectual]{.underline} ~~blindness~~
[\[ignorance\] to the self-fulfilling nature of one of its time-honoured
paradigms]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} ~~blindness~~
\[[ignorance]{.underline}\], [in turn, allows the justification of more
containment or hedging]{.underline}. In this way, [the 'China threat'
paradigm is not only self-fulfilling in practice, but also
self-productive and self-perpetuating as a powerful mode of
representation]{.underline}. One might take comfort in the fact that
neither Beijing nor Washington actually wants a direct military
confrontation. But that is beside the point, for [the lack of aggressive
intention alone is no proven safe barrier to war. As in the cases of the
Korean War and the Vietnam War, the outbreak of war does not necessarily
require the intention to go to war]{.underline}.137 [Mutual suspicion,
as US President Theodore Roosevelt once observed of the Kaiser and the
English, is often all that is needed to set in motion a downward
spiral]{.underline}.138 [And thanks to the 'China threat' paradigm and
its mirror image and practice from China, mutual suspicion and distrust
has not been in short supply]{.underline}.139 A war between these two
great powers is not inevitable or even probable; the door for mutual
engagement and cooperation remains wide open. Nevertheless, ~~blind~~
\[[ignorant]{.underline}\] [to its own self-fulfilling consequences, the
'China threat' paradigm, if left unexamined and unchecked, would make
cooperation more difficult and conflict more likely.]{.underline} It is
worth adding that my treatment of Chinese nationalism and realpolitik
thinking is not to downplay their potentially dangerous consequences,
much less to justify them. Quite the contrary, for all the apparent
legitimacy of reciprocal counter-violence or counter-hedging, [Chinese
mimicry is dangerous, as it would feed into this tit-for-tat vicious
cycle and play its part in the escalation of a security dilemma between
the US and China]{.underline}. Thus, to emphasise Chinese responsiveness
is not to deny Chinese agency or exonerate its responsibility. While the
general nature of Chinese foreign policy may be responsive with regard
to the US, its 'contents' are not simply passive, innocent mimicry of US
thinking and behaviour, but inevitably come with some 'Chinese
characteristics'. That said, those 'Chinese characteristics'
notwithstanding, [there is no pregiven China threat both unresponsive to
and immune from any external stimulus]{.underline}. To argue otherwise
is to deny an important dimension of Chinese agency, namely, their
response-ability. [By examining the self-fulfilling tendency of the
'China threat' paradigm, we can better understand that Sino-American
relations, like international relations in general, are mutually
responsive and constitutive]{.underline}. Thus, [both China and the US
should be held accountable to the bilateral relationship of their mutual
making]{.underline}. To the extent that this 'China threat' knowledge
often denies such mutuality, and by extension, US responsibility in the
rise of the China threat, it is all the more imperative to lay bare its
intrinsic link with power practice.

### Link -- Climate Refugees 

#### Disaster has been transformed into development -- the 1ac's framing of uncertainty and conflict fuels a larger discourse that has been refashioned by the national security state to justify its liberal projects globally -- that creates endless feedback loops that make conflict inevitable

**Duffield '12** (Mark Duffield, Global Insecurities Centre, School of
Sociology, Politics and International Studies, University of Bristol,
UK, "Challenging environments: Danger, resilience and the aid industry:
from protection to resilience" Security Dialogue, 43(5) 475--492)

[The perception of an increasingly hostile operational
environment]{.underline} is not confined to aid agencies working in the
global south. It [resonates with government views of what national
security now means for liberal states.]{.underline} In comparison with
the supposed predictability of superpower rivalry during the Cold War,
[security experts now tell us that the world is more unknown and
volatile]{.underline} (Rasmussen, 2001). [National security has been
refashioned around the principle of radical uncertainty]{.underline}
(Cabinet Office, 2008; Department of Homeland Security, 2005). Building
on complexity and network theory, [national security imagines its
exogenous risk environment as a potentially borderless social-ecological
terrain shaped by the emergent properties of radically interconnected
contingent events]{.underline}. As Michael Dillon (2007: 46) has argued,
'[the contingent has now become the primary strategic principle of
formation for the generic security of life which liberal governmental
rule now purses globally'.]{.underline} [Security occupies a networked
terrain of feedback loops and multiplier effects]{.underline} [that are
made dangerous by the immanent possibility of synchronous
failure]{.underline} (Pelosky, 2002). [It occupies a magical space of
flows where butterflies can flap their wings in Australia and cause
hurricanes in America.]{.underline}

[Such]{.underline} radical [interconnectedness allows us to
imagine]{.underline}, for example, [how a drought]{.underline} in
Africa, or a similar zone of imagined indwelling social-ecological
breakdown, [might increase rural poverty and augment environmental
stress.]{.underline} In turn, [the resulting scarcity exacerbates local
conflict and further entrenches poverty]{.underline} (Collier et al.,
2003; International Development Committee, 1999). [Poverty, scarcity and
conflict are also drivers of population displacement, refugee flows,
international shadow economies and even terrorism, all of which threaten
international security]{.underline} (World Bank, 2011). [Our current
understanding of dangerous climate change]{.underline} [merges
effortlessly with this global security imaginary]{.underline} (Busby,
2007). [Climate change has become a force multiplier]{.underline} for
all the various social, economic and political factors that exacerbate
poverty and thus, through the radical interconnectivity of contingent
events, global insecurity (Mitchell and Van Aalst, 2008; Oxfam, 2009).
[This complexity-based view]{.underline} of the coming age of
catastrophe [has]{.underline}, in turn, [been seamlessly absorbed across
the socio-economic and environmental policy spectrum]{.underline} (World
Economic Forum, 2010). [Not only does it shape national security, it
also informs donor governments' humanitarian and development
thinking]{.underline} (UNDP, 2004). A recent review of the UK Department
for International Development's humanitarian assistance, for example,
has predicted that more people in the underdeveloped world 'will be
affected by humanitarian emergencies in the coming decades. Not only
will they become more frequent, they will also be increasingly
unpredictable and complex' (Humanitarian Emergency Response Review,
2011: 9). Indeed, [such vulnerability defines what underdevelopment has
become in the post-Cold War era.]{.underline}

While complexity thinking is the new conventional wisdom, as recently as
the 1970s such views would have appeared fanciful to the disaster
experts of the day. The dominant approach to disaster was then shaped by
modernist assumptions and concerns. Emergencies were not regarded, as
now, as being integral to the human--environment relationship. They were
unscheduled events, discrete accidents or unusual occurrences lying
outside of society that 'destabilise or violate ordinary life and
relations to the habitat' (Hewitt, 1983: 6, emphasis in original). The
aim of emergency response was to place some form of protective barrier
or quarantine between the site of the disaster, its victims and normal
society. In his important critique from 1983, Kenneth Hewitt argues that
the modernist approach to emergency had three interconnected components
or belief systems: first, that geophysical processes, and their human
impacts, could be predicted; second, that one could plan comprehensively
and respond managerially to either contain such processes or, where
impossible, relocate the human activities or populations concerned; and
finally, including the logistical capacities of military and
quasi-military forces, that one could create a centralized emergency
response capacity based on a hierarchy of relief organizations.
[Modernist responses to emergency situations typically involved things
like flood-control works, cloud seeding, urban zoning, buildingcode
enforcement, avalanche defence, sealing off affected areas, refugee
camps or civil-defencestyle relocations of threatened
populations]{.underline}.

As Hewitt argues, such [acts of separation and quarantine tended to
reinforce the otherness of emergency.]{.underline} [Rather than
radically interconnected events, disasters were]{.underline} more or
less [random and isolated misfortunes.]{.underline} An important
consequence of this walling-off of disaster was that [modernism found it
difficult to contemplate human activity itself as creating emergency
conditions]{.underline}. [Actions that invited catastrophe could arise
only by accident, negligence or deliberate sabotage. To argue that
'government, business, science or other institutions create disaster has
been outlawed from rational discourse']{.underline} (Hewitt, 1983: 17).
Such possibilities could exist only as so-called conspiracy theories.
[Emergency was not]{.underline}, as it has once more become, [a moral
judgement on human actions: it was more an unplanned
side-effect.]{.underline} Rather than being drivers of catastrophe,
things like [poverty, scarcity and conflict]{.underline}, for example,
[were the unfinished business of progress]{.underline}. To be sure,
uncertainty occupies a central place in both modernist and postmodernist
conceptions of disaster. Importantly, however, each accords it a
different significance. For modernism, it was the inexact and incomplete
knowledge of when, where and upon whom emergency might fall that
provided 'scientific credibility for the treatment of natural disasters
as "accidents"' (Hewitt, 1983: 20). However, despite the best of
efforts, the accurate prediction of disasters has remained, in large
measure, uncertain. [Continuing uncertainty is essential to the
postmodernist critique.]{.underline} [Rather than justifying the
walling-off of emergency, today's conventional wisdom pulls in the
opposite direction.]{.underline} As Pat O'Malley has argued, however,
this is not simply a conceptual difference; [it reflects a longstanding
political struggle between two rationalities of security. Modernist
society was to be managed through scientific knowledge operating
according to quasi-natural laws revealed in probability and
risk.]{.underline} In opposition, [a countervailing neoliberal
rationality exists where 'security and freedom are founded]{.underline}
(and morally founded) [in]{.underline} techniques of [individual
foresight and agency']{.underline} (O'Malley, 2009: 33). The neoliberal
counter-revolution broke out on multiple fronts during the 1970s. For
this liberal imaginary, '[freedom was registered precisely by the
uncertainty of the future, a future that could not be predicted
accurately if indeed subjects were (liberally) free to invent it
anew']{.underline} (O'Malley, 2009: 33). From this perspective, [the
challenge of radical interconnectivity is not to protect against
it]{.underline}, especially since it cannot be wholly predicted, [but to
consciously embrace the reality of its immanence]{.underline} (Peters,
1987). Instead of fearing disasters per se, [we are urged to learn the
new life-skills of preparedness and resilience and so exploit the
emergent opportunities that disorder invariably creates]{.underline}
(Bahadur et al., 2010; Folke, 2006).4

[While resilience thinking and neoliberalism are different]{.underline},
[they are intertwined]{.underline} [in terms of their
emergence]{.underline} (O'Malley, 2009; Walker and Cooper, 2011). Since
the 1990s, [resilience has quickly become an expansive lingua franca of
preparedness, adaptation and survivability]{.underline}. Distinguished
by its effortless ability to move across the natural, social and
psychological sciences, it is multidisciplinary in a radical sense of
the term, while also enjoying epic scalability. It can be invoked at the
level of organisms and individual psychology, is found in natural
habitats and social institutions, and forms a vital property of the
built environment. One can use the same conceptual framework to talk,
for example, about the resilience of freshwater aquatic systems
(Holling, 1973), how cities maintain or lose essential functions
(Coaffee and Wood, 2006) or, for that matter, how aid workers cope with
stress (Blanchetiere, 2006; Comoretto et al., 2011). [If emergency,
through the interconnectivity it reveals, constitutes a new ontology of
life, then resilience has become a monotonous characteristic of
everything]{.underline}. Commonly understood as the capacity to absorb
shocks and bounce back, [resilience]{.underline} [is]{.underline} also
[the]{.underline} important [ability to move between different states of
temporary equilibrium, like those characterizing periods of prolonged
disturbance and crisis, while at the same time maintaining system
functionality]{.underline} (Folke, 2006). Indeed, the acolytes of
resilience would go further. [It is not simply a question of bouncing
back; in embracing uncertainty as opportunity, the aim is to bounce back
better]{.underline} (DFID, 2011: 9). [Disaster]{.underline} -- or, at
least, the possibilities that its immanence creates -- [is now the new
development]{.underline} (Bahadur et al., 2010; Schipper and Pelling,
2006; UNDP, 2004).

As a condition of its possibility, this new development depends upon its
client communities and populations being free of modernist technologies
of certainty and autonomy. To have a chance of working, [communities
have to be exposed, opened up or]{.underline}, in some way, [abandoned
to the possibility of risk and uncertainty. Only then is there a real
opportunity that foresight, enterprise and responsibility can take
root.]{.underline}

Compared to modernist forms of protection, such [processes of 'freeing
up' suggest the emergence of a new biopolitics.]{.underline} [While
resilience has strengthened its hold in the present climate of austerity
and neoliberal consolidation]{.underline}, since the 1970s, in order to
create this possibility, [a biopolitical opening up has been taking
place on numerous levels and sites across the
development--underdevelopment divide.]{.underline} [Some of this
neoliberal stripping away has been imposed]{.underline}, especially in
the economic and social welfare fields. [Other aspects have been
embraced in the name of freedom itself, particularly with regard to
consumption, debt and self-identity.]{.underline} In this multileveled,
wide-ranging and ambiguous process, [modernist technologies of
society-wide protection, regulation and social insurance have been
progressively exchanged for more self-oriented skills of
self-management, preparedness and resilience]{.underline} (Dean, 1999;
Rose, 2000). Before I critically revisit the perception that aid work
has become more dangerous, the postmodern reinterpretation of disaster
will be examined as an example of this broad shift.

Internalizing emergency

This section provides a genealogical sketch of the transition from the
modernist view of disaster as something external to society to seeing it
as intrinsic to the internal functioning of society itself, and thus
requiring urgent governance. By the end of the Cold War, the disaster
zone had been reworked as a morally conflicted space of predatory
winners and hapless losers. Working through such categories, [the
internalization of emergency provided a powerful moral justification for
liberal interventionism and the post-Cold War expansion of the aid
industry into challenging environments. It rationalized aid workers own
'freeing up' or exposure to new risk environments and the willingness of
many to embrace this opportunity.]{.underline} Modernism banished God
from disasters; rather than a divine punishment for human failings, they
were reworked as accidents or unusual occurrences. [The postmodernist
turn]{.underline}, however, [has brought an eschatology of human folly
back into the equation]{.underline} (Duffield and Evans, 2011). Since
the 1970s, [the modernist conception of disasters as]{.underline} more
or less [random events outside of normal society has been progressively
abandoned.]{.underline} [Emergency has been internalized and normalized
as integral to the functioning of society.]{.underline} [Human agency
and choice have once again become important]{.underline}-- [hence the
need to govern their outcomes.]{.underline} [While the present
climate-change debate epitomizes this shift]{.underline} (Grove, 2010),
[earlier changes in the interpretation of famine anticipate this
move.]{.underline} During the 1970s, it was still common for
policymakers to regard famine as resulting from absolute and externally
induced food shortages. The work of Amartya Sen (1981) has been
influential in shifting our understanding of famine from outside to
inside society. [Rather than absolute shortages, famine now resides in
the unequal social capital and degrees of market exclusion]{.underline}
that befall individuals and define their different abilities to access
that food which is available in the marketplace. [Rather than
socio-economic reform and income redistribution, Sen's]{.underline}
entitlement [approach emphasizes 'individual inclusion and choice-making
capacities']{.underline} (Chandler, forthcoming).

### Link -- Climate Refugees 

#### The apocalyptic framing of climate refugees necessitates the redefining of the "human" worthy of protection -- that mobilizes violent humanitarian projects that converts local suffering into national gain

**Methmann and Oels '15** (Chris Methmann, Independent Researcher,
Angela Oels, Distance Teaching University in Hagen, "From 'fearing' to
'empowering' climate refugees: Governing climate-induced migration in
the name of resilience" Germany Security Dialogue, 2015, Vol. 46(1)
51--68)

[This articulation of climate refugees as a threat to national security
is in line with the longstanding xenophobia and securitization of
migration in Western liberal democracies in general]{.underline}
(Huysmans, 2006). All too often [these liberal democracies enable the
use of sovereign power in the name of a threat to national
security]{.underline} (Bigo, 2008).

Saving climate refugees

The dominant discourse shifted during the 1990s (Morrissey, 2009). This
was due to three interrelated developments. First, a growing number of
scholars questioned the theoretical, methodological and empirical
foundations of the discourse linking environmental change to violent
conflict and migration. Migration and conflict were understood as
multi-causal, depending on the adaptive capacity of affected
populations, so that large-scale projections were judged to be
implausible (Suhrke, 1994; Barnett, 2001; Peluso and Watts, 2001).
Second, the 1990s was a decade of 'humanitarian' military interventions.
In such cases, [the international community refused to be a witness to
'crimes against humanity' and declared itself responsible for the
protection of victims of civil war.]{.underline} Consequently,
['sovereignty had to give way to intervention in order for a new world
of global rights and global security to be enforced']{.underline}
(Chandler, 2012: 214).

[A third important influence was political campaigning for a
redefinition of security in terms of human security. The]{.underline}
[motivation]{.underline} behind this move [was the hope of freeing up
substantial resources for development]{.underline} (which at that time
were used for defense). In 1994, [the United Nations Development
Programme]{.underline} published a report entitled New Dimensions of
Human Security (UNDP, 1994) which [redefined security from the security
of states to that of people.]{.underline} [Human security successfully
became the dominant discourse in development policy and was influential
within the UN system, though often without the explicit use of the
term]{.underline} (Chandler, 2012). [Environmental change soon became
reconceptualized as a threat to human security]{.underline} (Barnett,
2001; Dalby, 2002). [The growing importance of the concept of
vulnerability was characteristic of this shift]{.underline} (Methmann
and Oels, 2014).

For proponents of a human security approach to environmental change,
[the main goal is to 'peacefully reduc\[e\] human vulnerability to
human-induced environmental degradation by addressing the root causes of
environmental degradation and human insecurity']{.underline} (Barnett,
2001: 229). Some more radical proponents of this approach relate
vulnerability to Northern consumption, economic globalization, human
rights and ecological interdependence (Dalby, 2009). In any case, [the
concept allows for the precise location and mapping of those people who
are most vulnerable to environmental change, and the initiation of
interventions and management based on these predictions]{.underline}
(O'Brien et al., 2004). In addition, [vulnerability defines the umbrella
under which environmentally and climate-induced migration are often
discussed]{.underline} (Thow and de Blois, 2008; Renaud et al., 2011).

Against this backdrop, [climate change induced migration is represented
as a threat to human security.]{.underline} As Duffield and Waddell have
argued, [human security defines 'the "humans" requiring securing and, at
the same time, call\[s\] forth the state/non-state networks of aid,
subjectivity and political practice necessary for that
undertaking']{.underline} (Duffield and Waddell, 2006: 2). In doing so,
[a space for intervention is created that Western governments may
fill.]{.underline} A good case in point with regard to this discourse is
the UN Secretary-General's 2009 report on climate change and its
possible security implications (UN GA, 2009). [Foucault describes
biopolitics as the identification and top-down intervention into
pathogenic parts of the population: in line with this, the UN report
suggests that '\[a\]dequately planning for and managing
environmentally-induced migration will be critical']{.underline} (UN GA,
2009: 17). [The report mobilizes a legal discourse which focuses on the
rights of affected populations:]{.underline}

[Islands becoming uninhabitable or disappearing as a result of sea-level
rise raise the issue of the legal status of the citizens and legal
rights of these States, including over fisheries.]{.underline} \[...\]
[Legal and political arrangements may be necessary for the protection of
affected populations.]{.underline} (UN GA, 2009: 21)

[This biopolitical discourse results in a call for]{.underline} [a new
legal climate refugee status]{.underline} [that would grant protection
to climate change induced migrants, including the right to
non-refoulement and access to humanitarian aid.]{.underline} Most people
displaced by climate change cannot be granted these rights under the
Refugee Convention because the Convention requires political persecution
as the basis for offering protection. Moreover, most of those displaced
by climate change are internally displaced and will not cross a national
border. Nevertheless, they are conceptualized as in need of
international support. It has been suggested that [the Refugee
Convention be extended to recognize 'environmental
persecution']{.underline} (Conisbee and Simms, 2003: 33), [or to create
a new legal instrument either as a stand-alone convention]{.underline}
(Docherty and Giannini, 2009; Environmental Justice Foundation, 2008)
[or as a protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change]{.underline} (WBGU, 2007; Biermann and Boas, 2010). [Because it
is difficult to make individual decisions regarding
eligibility]{.underline} [for climate refugee status]{.underline},
[Biermann and Boas propose declaring entire regions to be threatened by
climate change and suggest resettling their populations collectively in
advance.]{.underline} [When orderly management fails or comes too late,
such discourse could mobilize humanitarian aid and humanitarian military
intervention in the name of the human rights of affected
populations]{.underline}. However, [the use of such violent measures is
not framed as overriding the sovereignty of affected states but as
empowering partnerships with these governments]{.underline} (Chandler,
2012: 225). This demonstrates how [a sovereign economy of power can be
mobilized in the name of human rights within a government based on
liberal biopower.]{.underline}

[A case in point is the response to Hurricane Katrina]{.underline},
which struck New Orleans in 2005. The media have often described the
'victims' of this hurricane as the first 'climate refugees' in
industrialized countries (Oels and Carvalho, 2012). The use of this
label is remarkable, because the vast majority were US citizens
displaced within the USA. [The US media portrayed New Orleans after
Katrina as a 'snake-pit of anarchy']{.underline} (Tierney et al., 2006:
68). In response to this and other influences, Governor Kathleen [Blanco
called on the thousands of armed forces deployed to New Orleans to
restore public order]{.underline}. As a result, [the pursuit of
'looters' took priority over saving lives]{.underline} (Tierney et al.,
2006: 75). [Because all survivors were treated as potential looters or
criminals, the US military's approach to rescue was one of
body-searching and arresting survivors to make sure that they did not
remain in unsafe buildings]{.underline} (Tierney et al., 2006: 70).
Hurricane Katrina thus represents a case in point of the use of
sovereign power in a regime of liberal biopower.

### Link -- Cyber War 

#### Securitizing creations of cyberwar are constructed and create conditions for permanent war

**Lawson '12** (Sean Lawson is Assistant Professor in the Department of
Communication at the University of Utah. His essays on science,
technology, and security have appeared in the journals Social Studies of
Science, Security Dialogue, Cold War History and Journal of Information
Technology & Politics. \"Putting the \"war\" in cyberwar: Metaphor,
analogy, and cybersecurity discourse in the United States\"; First
Monday,
<http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3848/3270>)

Although in the case of the law of war, cyber war proponents have too
quickly abandoned definitions, rules, and norms of war that are and
should still be relevant to cyber conflict, in the case of cyber
deterrence, many of these same individuals have too quickly adopted a
framework that is "deeply flawed and largely unworkable" (Lewis, 2009b).
First and foremost, this is the case because, as Martin Libicki of RAND
notes, "Cyberspace is its own medium with its own rules. \[\...\] Thus,
deterrence and warfighting tenets established in other media do not
necessarily translate reliably into cyberspace" \[30\]. [Not only does
the nuclear deterrence analogy tend to lead its users to "exaggerate the
destructive capacity of cyber weapons," it also results in a tendency to
focus on hypothetical worst cases while ignoring actual
threats]{.underline} (Lewis, 2009b). For example, while Raduege admitted
that "low--level" attacks are predominant, he nonetheless advocated that
national policy should focus on "strategic attacks" that "could one day"
occur (Raduege, 2011). This tendency presents several problems. First,
if cyber weapon capabilities have been exaggerated, then it is unlikely
that strategic cyber attacks, if they did occur, could be decisive in
the way that nuclear weapons could be \[31\]. Ironically, however,
[without the potential for decisiveness, the threat of cyber retaliation
alone would likely have little deterrent value]{.underline}, meaning
that [one would have to rely upon threats of physical retaliation to
deter cyber attacks]{.underline}. In turn, [this could encourage an
escalation to physical confrontation]{.underline} --- that is, assuming
the defender follows through on his threat of retaliation, without which
any future threats would lose credibility. Second, [the threat of
massive retaliation]{.underline}, either cyber or physical, [has not and
will not deter the actual and pervasive "low--level" cyber attacks
experienced on a daily basis]{.underline}. It is important to remember
that during the Cold War, the threat of massive retaliation did not
deter all war. It only deterred all--out nuclear war. As Raduege (2011)
notes, the Cold War ended up taking the form of numerous proxy wars
fought around the globe, from Southeast Asia to Latin America.
Similarly, not only will [U.S. capabilities for]{.underline} and threats
of [massive retaliation]{.underline} in response to cyber attacks not
deter the daily occurrence of low--level attacks, it [will likely
encourage potential adversaries to constantly seek to pose challenges
that fall below the threshold that would trigger massive
retaliation]{.underline}, either cyber or kinetic. Finally, all of this
points to another problem: a simplification of nuclear deterrence and
Cold War history. Nuclear strategists confronted these same problems in
the 1960s as it became increasingly clear that Eisenhower era threats of
"massive retaliation" had lost their credibility and value. This
resulted in a robust debate about "flexible response," escalation, the
role of conventional forces in promoting nuclear deterrence, and much
more. In short, there was no one nuclear deterrence strategy during the
Cold War. Nuclear strategy evolved over time (Freedman, 1989).
Unfortunately, current notions of cyber deterrence are more akin to the
1950s strategy of massive retaliation that was ultimately deemed
incredible and dangerous in comparison to the later, more nuanced
variants of deterrence. Finally, [a number of other differences between
nuclear weapons and cyber weapons render the quest for cyber deterrence
inappropriate at best and even potentially
counterproductive.]{.underline} Cyber attacks generally suffer from a
crisis of cause and effect. In one variant, this is what cyber war
experts call the "attribution problem" --- i.e., [it is difficult to
know who the attacker is because of online anonymity]{.underline}. As
Mike McConnell and others have noted, deterrence is impossible without
the ability to credibly threaten the attacker. But deterrence is also
difficult if one cannot reliably know in advance the effects of one's
response. In cyberspace, [the "collateral damage" caused by cyber
attacks can be unpredictable, which could reduce "the willingness of
political leaders to incur the risk of a retaliatory response that goes
awry, widening a conflict or creating unfavorable political
consequences"]{.underline} (Lewis, 2009a). The unpredictable results of
a cyber response could encourage the use of a more predictable but more
deadly physical response. It is for all of these reasons that Myriam
Dunn Cavelty warns against the use of the [language of deterrence and
aggression with respect to cyber threats]{.underline}. Such language [is
counterproductive because it results in a self--fulfilling prophecy:
actions taken by one state to increase its security can make others feel
less secure, resulting in their taking similar actions, which confirms
to the first state that it is insecure, and so on]{.underline} (Dunn
Cavelty, 2010).

### Link -- Deterrence 

#### Deterrence is a lethal and tautological ideology that enables unchecked violence 

**Barash '18** (David Ph.D., professor of psychology emeritus at
University of Washington, 1-14-2018, \"Nuclear deterrence is a myth. And
a lethal one at that,\"
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/nuclear-deterrence-myth-lethal-david-barash)

In his classic The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy (1989), Lawrence
Freedman, the dean of British military historians and strategists,
concluded: 'The Emperor Deterrence may have no clothes, but he is still
Emperor.' Despite his nakedness, this emperor continues to strut about,
receiving deference he doesn't deserve, while endangering the entire
world. [**Nuclear deterrence is** an idea that became **a** potentially
**lethal ideology**, one that remains influential **despite having
been** increasingly **discredited**.]{.underline} [After the United
States' nuclear bombings]{.underline} of Hiroshima and Nagasaki [in
1945, war changed]{.underline}. Until then, the overriding purpose of
military forces had ostensibly been to win wars. But according to the
influential US strategist Bernard Brodie writing in 1978: '[From now on
its chief purpose must be to avert them]{.underline}. It can have almost
no other useful purpose.' Thus, [nuclear deterrence was born, a
seemingly rational arrangement by which peace and stability were to
arise by the threat of mutually assured destruction]{.underline} (MAD,
appropriately enough). Winston Churchill described it in 1955 with
characteristic vigour: 'Safety will be the sturdy child of terror, and
survival the twin brother of annihilation.' [Importantly, deterrence
became not only a purported strategy, but **the very grounds on which**
governments justified nuclear weapons themselves. Every government
that]{.underline} now [possesses nuclear weapons claims]{.underline}
that [they deter attacks]{.underline} by their threat of catastrophic
retaliation. [Even a brief examination]{.underline}, however, [reveals
that deterrence is not remotely]{.underline} as [compelling]{.underline}
a principle as its reputation suggests. In his novel The Ambassadors
(1903), Henry James described a certain beauty as 'a jewel brilliant and
hard', at once twinkling and trembling, adding that 'what seemed all
surface one moment seemed all depth the next'. [The public has been
bamboozled by the shiny surface appearance of deterrence]{.underline},
with its promise of strength, security and safety. [But what has been
touted as profound strategic depth crumbles with surprising ease when
subjected to critical scrutiny. Let's start by considering the core of
deterrence theory: that it has worked.]{.underline} Advocates of nuclear
deterrence insist that we should thank it for the fact that a third
world war has been avoided, even when tensions between the two
superpowers -- the US and the USSR -- ran high. Advocates of nuclear
deterrence insist that we should thank it for the fact that a third
world war has been avoided, even when tensions between the two
superpowers -- the US and the USSR -- ran high. Some supporters even
maintain that deterrence set the stage for the fall of the Soviet Union
and the defeat of Communism. In this telling, the West's nuclear
deterrent prevented the USSR from invading western Europe, and delivered
the world from the threat of Communist tyranny. There are, however,
compelling arguments suggesting that [the US and the former Soviet Union
avoided world war for several possible reasons, most notably because
neither side wanted to go to war.]{.underline} Indeed, the US and Russia
never fought a war prior to the nuclear age. [Singling out nuclear
weapons]{.underline} as the reason why the Cold War never became hot
[is]{.underline} somewhat [like saying that a junkyard car, without an
engine or wheels, never sped off the lot only because no one turned the
key.]{.underline} Logically speaking, **[there is no way to demonstrate
that nuclear weapons kept the peace during the Cold War, or that they do
so now.]{.underline}** Perhaps peace prevailed between the two
superpowers simply because they had no quarrel that justified fighting a
terribly destructive war, even a conventional one. There is no evidence,
for example, that the Soviet leadership ever contemplated trying to
conquer western Europe, much less that it was restrained by the West's
nuclear arsenal. Post facto arguments -- especially negative ones --
might be the currency of pundits, but are impossible to prove, and offer
no solid ground for evaluating a counterfactual claim, conjecturing why
something has not happened. In colloquial terms, if a dog does not bark
in the night, can we say with certainty that no one walked by the house?
Deterrence enthusiasts are like the woman who sprayed perfume on her
lawn every morning. When a perplexed neighbour asked about this strange
behaviour, she replied: 'I do it to keep the elephants away.' The
neighbour protested: 'But there aren't any elephants within 10,000 miles
of here,' whereupon the perfume-sprayer replied: 'You see, it works!'
[We should not congratulate our leaders, or deterrence theory, much less
nuclear weapons, for keeping the peace.]{.underline} What we can say is
that, as of this morning, those with the power to exterminate life have
not done so. But this is not altogether comforting, and history is no
more reassuring. The duration of 'nuclear peace', from the Second World
War to the end of the Cold War, lasted less than five decades. More than
20 years separated the First and Second World Wars; before that, there
had been more than 40 years of relative peace between the end of the
Franco-Prussian War (1871) and the First World War (1914), and 55 years
between the Franco-Prussian War and Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo
(1815). [Even in war-prone Europe, decades of peace have not been so
rare. Each time, when peace ended and the next war began, the war
involved weapons available at the time --]{.underline} which, for the
next big one, would likely include nuclear weapons. [The only way to
make sure that nuclear weapons are not used is to make sure that there
are no such weapons. **There is**]{.underline} certainly **[no reason to
think that the presence of nuclear weapons will prevent their
use]{.underline}**. The first step to ensuring that humans do not
unleash nuclear holocaust might be to show that the Emperor Deterrence
has no clothes -- which would then open the possibility of replacing the
illusion with something more suitable. It is possible that the post-1945
US-Soviet peace came 'through strength', but that need not imply nuclear
deterrence. It is also undeniable that the presence of nuclear weapons
on hair-trigger alert capable of reaching each other's homeland in
minutes has made both sides edgy.

### Link -- Deterrence 

#### The pursuit of deterrence is the collapse of war and peace into a form of social life that maintains its coherence through destruction. The image of the bomb becomes the stimulant for the modern political economy and converts the world into a target -- results in the neoliberal destruction of politics and the environment 

**Chow '06** (Rey, Professor in Comparative Lit at Brown, "The Age of
the World Target: Self-Referentiality in War, Theory, and Comparative
Work" pgs. 31-33)

[If the dropping of the atomic bomb created \"deterrence,\"]{.underline}
as many continue to believe to this day, [what is the nature of
deterrence?]{.underline} (We can ask the same question about
\"defense,\" \"protection,\" \"security,\" and other similar concepts.)
[The atomic bomb did not simply stop the war; it also stopped the war by
escalating and intensifying violence to a hitherto unheard of scale.
What succeeded in \"deterring\" the war was an ultimate (am)munition;
destruction was now outdone by destruction itself. The elimination of
the actual physical warring activities had the effect not of bringing
war to an end but instead of promoting and accelerating
terrorism]{.underline}, and importantly, [the terrorism of so-called
\"deterrent\" weaponry. **The mushroom cloud**]{.underline}, therefore,
[**is** also **the image of this semiotic transfer, this blurring of the
boundary between war and peace**. The transfer ushered in the new age of
relativity and virtuality, an age in which powers of terror are
indistinguishable from powers of \"deterrence,\" and technologies of war
indissociable from practices of peace]{.underline}. These new forces of
relativity and virtuality are summarized in the following passages from
Virilio: There is no war, then, without representation, no sophisticated
weaponry without psychological mystification. [**Weapons are tools** not
just of destruc· tion but also **of perception**-that is to say,
**stimulants that make themselves felt through chemical, neurological
processes** in the sense organs and the central nervous system,
**affecting human reactions** and even the perceptual identification
**and differentiation** of object]{.underline} \... . . . By
demonstrating that they would not recoil from a civilian holocaust, the
Americans triggered in the minds of the enemy that information explo·
sion which Einstein, towards the end of his life, thought to be as
formidable as the atomic blast itself. \... Even when weapons are not
employed, they are active elements of ideological conquest.[24 This
fuzzing of the line between war and representation, between war
technology and peacetime technology, has brought about a number of
consequences. First, the visual rules and boundaries of war altered.
While battles for· merly tended to be fought with a clear demarcation of
battlefronts versus civilian spaces, the aerial bomb, by its
positionings in the skies, its intrusion into spaces that used to be
off·limits to soldiers, and its distance from the enemies]{.underline}
(a distance which made it impossible for the enemies to fight back) ,
destroyed once and for all those classic visual boundaries that used to
define battle. [Second, with the transformation of the skies into war
zones from which to attack, war was no longer a matter simply of
armament or of competing projectile weaponry; rather, it became
redefined as a matter of the logistics of perception, with seeing as its
foremost function, its fore· most means of preemptive combat. Third, in
yet a different way, the **preemptiveness** of seeing as a means **of
destruction continues to operate as such even after** the **war**.
Insofar as the image of the atomic blast serves as a peacetime weapon to
mobilize against war, it tends to preclude other types of
representation]{.underline}. For a long time nuclear danger remained the
predominant target against which peace coali· tions aimed their efforts,
while the equally disastrous effects caused by chemical and biological
weapons (nerve gases such as sarin and bacteria such as anthrax) seldom
received the same kind of extended public consideration until the Gulf
War of 1991. [The overwhelming effect of the continual imaging of the
mushroom cloud means that the world has been responding to the nuclear
blast as if by mimicry, **by making the nuclear horror its point of
identification** and attack, **and by being oblivious**]{.underline}
(until fairly recently) [**to** other forms of **damage to the
ecosphere** that have not attained the same level of
visibility.]{.underline}

### Link -- Deterrence 

#### Deterrence is the perfection of the disappearance of warfare into a global collaboration over logistical perception that normalizes the control of all life. 

**Chow '06** (Rey, Professor in Comparative Lit at Brown, "The Age of
the World Target: Self-Referentiality in War, Theory, and Comparative
Work" pgs. 33-35)

[The dropping of the atomic bombs effected]{.underline} what Michel
Foucault would call [a major shift in epistemes, a fundamental change in
the organization, production, and circulation of
knowledge\_]{.underline}25 [**War** after the atomic bomb **would no
longer be** the **physical, mechanical struggles between** combative
**oppositional groups, but would**]{.underline} increasingly [**come to
resemble collaborations in the logistics of perception between
partners** who occupy relative, but always mutually implicated,
positions]{.underline}.26 As in the case of [the competition between the
United States and the Soviet Union]{.underline} for several decades, war
[was]{.underline} more and more [to be fought in
virtuality]{.underline}, as an exchange of defensive positionings, [a
tacitly coordinated routine of upping the potential for war, a race for
the deterrent. Warring in virtuality meant competing with the enemy for
the stockpiling, rather than actual use, of preclusively horrifying
weaponry. **To terrorize the other**, one specializes **in
representation**, in the means of display and exhibition]{.underline}.
As [Virilio writes, \"A war of pictures and sounds is replacing the war
of objects (projectiles and missiles) .\"27 In the name of arms
reduction and limitation, the SALT and START agreements served to
promote, improve, and multiply armament between the United States and
the Soviet Union, which were]{.underline}, strictly speaking, [allies
rather than adversaries in the so-called \"Star Wars\"]{.underline} or
SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative) .28 Moreover, [war would exist from
now on as an agenda that is infinitely self-referential: war represents
not other types of struggles and conflicts what in history classes are
studied as \"causes\"-but war itself. From its previous conventional,
negative signification as a blockade, an inevitable but regretted
interruption of the continuity that is \"normal life,\" war shifts to a
new level of force. It has become **not the cessation of normality,
but** rather, **the very definition of normality itself.** The space and
time of war are no longer segregated]{.underline} in the form of an
other; [instead, they operate from]{.underline} within the here and now,
as [the internal logic of the here and now]{.underline}. From being
negative blockade to being normal routine, [war becomes the positive
mechanism, momentum, and condition of possibility of society, creating a
hegemonic space of global communication through powers of visibility and
control]{.underline}. It is important to note that [**the
normativization of** war and **war technology takes place** as well
among-perhaps especially **among-the defeated**]{.underline}. As Dower
writes, [in Japan, deficiency in science and technology was singled out
as the chief reason for defeat, and the atomic bomb was seen
simultaneously as \"a symbol of the terror of nuclear war and the
promise of science.\"]{.underline}29 [Because it was forbidden to
advance in militarism, postwar Japan specialized in the promotion of
science and technology for \"peace\" and for the consolidation of a
\"democratic\" society. Instead of bombs and missiles, Japan became one
of the world\'s leading producers of cars, cameras, computers, and other
kinds of \"high tech\" equipment]{.underline}.3o With Honda, Toyota,
Nissan, Hitachi, Toshiba, Sony, Sanyo, Nikon, Mitsubishi, and their like
becoming household names throughout the world, [the defeated \"victim\"
of the war rises again and rejoins the \"victor\" in a new competition,
the competition in bombarding the world with a different type of
implosion-information.3 1 With the preemptiveness of
seeing-as-destruction and the normativization of
technology-as-information, thus, comes the great epistemic shift, which
has been gradually occurring with the onset of speed technologies and
which finally virtualizes the world. As a condition that is no longer
separable from civilian life, war is thoroughly absorbed into the fabric
of our daily communications-our information channels, our entertainment
media, our machinery for speech and expression. We participate in war\'s
virtualization of the world as we use]{.underline}-without
thinking-television monitors, remote controls, mobile phones, digital
cameras, PalmPilots, and other electronic devices that fill the spaces
of everyday life. We do not usually notice the strangeness of, say,
listening to news on the radio about different calamities while
preparing lunch or dinner, nor are we shocked by the juxtaposition on
television of commercials with reports of rapes, tor- tures, or
genocides. [Our consumption of war, bloodshed, and violence through our
communication technologies is on a par with our consumption of various
forms of merchandise]{.underline}. There is, furthermore, another side
to the virtualization of the world which most of us do not experience
but which is even more alarming: when a war does occur, such as the Gulf
Wars that began in 1991 and 2003, the ubiquitous virtualization of
everyday life means that war can no longer be fought without the skills
of playing video games. In the aerial bombings of Iraq, the world was
divided into an above and a below in accordance with the privilege of
access to the virtual world. Up above in the sky, war was a matter of
maneuvers across the video screen by U.S. soldiers who had been
accustomed as teenagers to playing video games at home; down below, war
remained tied to the body, to manual labor, to the random disasters
falling from the heavens. For the U.S. men and women of combat, the
elitism and aggressiveness of panoramic vision went hand in hand with
distant control and the instant destruction of others; for the ordinary
men, women, and children of Iraq (as for the ordinary people of Korea
and Vietnam in the 1950S and 1960s) , life became more and more
precarious-immaterial in the sense of a readiness for total demolition
at any moment.32 Even as we speak, the Pentagon is reported to be
building its own Internet for the wars of the future, with the goal \"to
give all American commanders and troops \[including those on the
ground\] a moving picture of all foreign enemies and threats-\'a
God\'s-eye view\' ofbattle.\"33

[A telling example of this self-mobilization]{.underline} and
self-anticipation [against one's own conduct can be found in the way
Western states]{.underline} (or, rather, their governmental agencies)
along with some transnational organizations (the World Health
Organization, the United Nations) [have asked populations to
preemptively take care of their health, hygiene, and everyday routines
in the context of the ongoing]{.underline} A⁄H1N1 or ''[swine flu''
pandemic]{.underline}. [In this recent case of popular health scare, as
with many other instances of spreading epidemics over the past decade
(SARS, the H5N1 ''bird flu,'' but also AIDS before), individuals and
groups are asked to be the first layers of securitization by turning
their bodies]{.underline} (or those of family members, neighbors,
coworkers, etc.) into primordial sites of analysis and scrutiny from
where not only the disease but, just as importantly, [the fear about
what might happen with the disease will be monitored]{.underline}. With
the ''swine flu,'' [a constant questioning of one's body movements and
symptomatic features]{.underline}, but also [of one's daily
habits]{.underline}, [becomes an automatic]{.underline} (and autoimmune)
[measure against the endemic fear]{.underline}. Individual and
collective [bodies become the most vital dispositifs of containment of
the pandemic and of the terror that inevitably will spread]{.underline}.
[This management or governance of the ''swine flu'' and its
scare]{.underline} (the disease and its terror are inseparable from the
moment a pandemic discourse is launched) [is said to require constant
self-checking]{.underline} (Do I have a fever? Is my cough a sign that I
have been infected? Did I remember to wash my hands after riding the bus
or the subway?). But [it]{.underline} also [demands]{.underline} what
can be called [selfcarceralization]{.underline} measures (we must stay
home for several days if we feel sick; we must wear protective masks if
we venture outside and have a runny nose; we must close entire schools
for as long as necessary if we suspect that children in the community
have the flu). In the end, [it is a full-blown biopolitics of selfterror
that sets in whereby people must allow themselves to be
quarantined]{.underline}, must accept being placed in hospital
isolation, and must even be willing not to be treated if pharmaceutical
companies fail to produce enough vaccines for everyone[. As the A⁄H1N1
pandemic preemption regime reveals, individual and collective bodies
must always be prepared to immerse themselves into disciplinary and
regulatory procedures, into security mechanisms, and into governmental
tactics]{.underline}. In fact, [they must act as dispositifs of fear
governance themselves]{.underline}. This means that [bodies become the
required lines of forces that connect the possible localized symptoms to
the global pandemic and its terror]{.underline}. From this perspective
on [how bodies in societies of unease enable regimes of biopolitical
terror and are themselves the product of operations of governmentalized
fear,]{.underline} no return to a centralized model of power is
necessary to make sense of the terror embedded in contemporary regimes
of government. Rather, [as the ''swine flu'' case shows, it is the
horizontality, the capillarity, and the propagation of carceral effects
across space and through time that authenticates this (self) imposition
of governmental power and force]{.underline}. But [what this system of
reproduction of self-governmentalized scare tactics and biopolitical
(in)security calls for]{.underline}, however, [is the beginning of a
different understanding of life, or of what life means.]{.underline}
Indeed, [it is not enough anymore to think of life as docile or
regulated. It may also not be sufficient to think of today's living
bodies as abandoned beings]{.underline} (Agamben 1998) [caught in a
state of sovereign exception]{.underline}. Rather, [the
self-rationalizing, self-securitizing, and self-terrorizing bodies that
act, react, and interact in coordination with agents ⁄ agencies of
government and are found at the heart of societies of fear production
are more likely to represent]{.underline} what Mick Dillon has called
''[emergent life']{.underline}' (Dillon 2007).

satisfaction in elaborating fictions of the End is double-edged. On the
one hand, its ultimate object is some version of the crystalline New
Jerusalem, an image of purity so absolute that it denies the organic
messiness of life. \[1\] On the other hand, apocalyptic fictions
typically linger on pain and suffering]{.underline}. [The end result of
apocalyptic purification often seems of less importance than the
narrative pleasure derived from the bizarre and opulent tribulations of
the bodies being burnt by fire and brimstone, tormented by scorpion
stings, trodden like grapes in the winepress]{.underline}. [In this
interplay]{.underline} between the incorporeal purity of the ends and
the violent corporeality of the means [the apocalyptic body is born. It
is a body whose mortal sickness is a precondition of ultimate health,
whose grotesque and excessive sexuality issues in angelic sexlessness,
and whose torture underpins a painless\--and
lifeless\--millennium]{.underline}.The apocalyptic body is perverse,
points out Tina Pippin, unstable and mutating from maleness to
femaleness and back again, purified by the sadomasochistic
\"bloodletting on the cross,\" trembling in abject terror while awaiting
an unearthly consummation (122). But most of all it is a suffering body,
a text written in the script of stigmata, scars, wounds, and sores. [Any
apocalypse strikes the body politic like a disease, progressing from the
first symptoms of a large-scale disaster through the crisis of the
tribulation to the recovery of the millennium. But of all the Four
Horsemen, the one whose ride begins most intimately, in the private
travails of individual flesh, and ends in the devastation of the entire
community, is the last one, Pestilence. The contagious body is the most
characteristic modality of apocalyptic corporeality]{.underline}. At the
same time, I will argue, it contains a counterapocalyptic potential,
resisting the dangerous lure of Endism, the ideologically potent
combination of \"apocalyptic terror\", a nd \"millennial perfection\"
(Quinby 2). This essay, a brief sketch of the poetics and politics of
the contagious body, does not attempt a comprehensive overview of the
historical development of the trope of pestilence. Nor does it limit
itself to a particular disease, [along the lines of]{.underline} Susan
[Sontag\'s classic delineation]{.underline} of the poetics of TB [and
many subsequent attempts to develop a poetics of AIDS]{.underline}.
Rather[, my focus is on the general narrativity of contagion and on the
way the plague-stricken body is manipulated within the overall plot of
apocalyptic millennialism, which is a powerful ideological current in
twentieth-century political history, embracing such diverse
manifestations as religious fundamentalism, Nazism, and other forms of
\"radical desperation\"]{.underline} (Quinby 4\--5). Thus, I consider
both real and imaginary diseases, focusing on the narrative construction
of the contagious body rather than on the precise epidemiology of the
contagion. [All apocalyptic and millenarian ideologies ultimately
converge on the utopian transformation of the body (and the body
politic) through suffering]{.underline}. But pestilence offers a
uniquely ambivalent modality of corporeal apocalypse. On the one hand[,
it may be appropriated to the standard plot of apocalyptic purification
as a singularly atrocious technique of separating the damned from the
saved. Thus]{.underline}, [the plague becomes a metaphor for genocide,
functioning as such both in Mein Kampf and in Camus\'s The
Plague]{.underline}.\[2\] [On the other hand, the experience of a
pandemic undermines the giddy hopefulness of Endism. Since everybody is
a potential victim,]{.underline} [the line between the pure and the
impure can never be drawn with any precision.]{.underline} Instead of
delivering the climactic moment of the Last Judgment, pestilence lingers
on, generating a limbo of common suffering in which a tenuous and
moribund but all-embracing body politic springs into being. The end is
indefinitely postponed and the disease becomes a metaphor for the
process of livi ng. The finality of mortality clashes with the duration
of morbidity. Pestilence is poised on the cusp between divine punishment
and manmade disaster. On the one hand, unlike nuclear war or ecological
catastrophe, pandemic has a venerable historical pedigree that leads
back from current bestsellers such as Pierre Quellette\'s The Third
Pandemic (1996) to the medieval horrors of the Black Death and indeed to
the Book of Revelation itself. On the other hand, disease is one of the
central tropes of biopolitics, shaping much of the twentieth-century
discourse of power, domination, and the body. [Contemporary plague
narratives, including the burgeoning discourse of AIDS, are caught
between two contrary textual impulses: acquiescence in a (super) natural
judgment and political activism. Their impossible combination produces a
clash of two distinct plot modalities.]{.underline} [In his contemporary
incarnations the Fourth Horseman vacillates between the voluptuous
entropy of indiscriminate killing and the genocidal energy directed at
specific categories of victims. As Richard Dellamora points out in his
gloss on Derrida, apocalypse]{.underline} in general [may be used \"in
order to validate violence done to others]{.underline}\" while it may
also function as a modality of total resistance to the existing order
(3). But my concern here is not so much with the difference between
\"good\" and \"bad\" apocalypses (is total extinction \"better\" than
selective genocide?) as with the interplay of eschatology and politics
in the construction of the apocalyptic body.

### Link -- Economic Collapse 

#### Economic disaster serves as the quilting point for modern virtualized preemption; the transformation of economics into a risk factory -- this operative logic of speculative mastery ensures cycles of death-making and self-actualization

**Calkivik '10** (Emine Asli Calkivik, PhD in political science from the
University of Minnesota, October 2010, "Dismantling Security,"
<https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/99479/Calkivik_umn_0130E_11576.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>)

In addition to its enduring religiosity, [the contemporary politics of
security is additionally characterized by its futurity and
virtuality]{.underline}. The politics of security no longer merely
revolve around the question of being, of securing a life as it is.
[Reaching beyond the question of the actual, the realm of security has
now expanded to include "the potential to become dangerous"---a
phenomenon that the notion of "virtual security" aims to
capture]{.underline}.79 As opposed to the actual, "virtual" here does
not denote the non-existent. [Virtual is real, concretely present to the
extent that it exists potentially immanent in every object. The
non-existence of what has not yet happened becomes more real than what
has observably taken place]{.underline}.

Massumi explores the concept of the virtual in his discussion of
preemption as the primary operative logic of the contemporary politics
of security.80 [Operative logic designates an abstract matrix of power
that combines its own ontology and epistemology. In other words, it
brings together a mode of being and ways of knowing. It is at the level
of this operative logic that preemption as definitive of the present age
is differentiated from its Cold War predecessor---the logic of
deterrence]{.underline}. Like deterrence, where mutually assured
destruction assures the present stockpiling of nuclear bombs so as to
defer the potential of global annihilation, preemption also entails
action in the present against a future threat. Yet, unlike its
predecessor that relies on epistemological certainty that assumes
knowable, objective measurability, [epistemology of preemption is one of
contingency and uncertainty; the danger in question is still potential,
and not yet fully formed. What this means ontologically is that neither
the nature of the threat nor the enemy can be specified. For the
preemptive episteme that this logic brings into being, nothing is
perceived to be safe]{.underline}. Consequently, the global situation
becomes not threatening, but threat-generating; [the enemy is no longer
"a who, where, when or even what. The enemy is a
whatnot]{.underline}."81

While Massumi focuses on U.S. foreign policy under the Bush
administration within the context of the so-called Global War on Terror
in his discussion of preemption, [this logic is not limited to a
specific military doctrine of a specific administration. Rather, the
field of operation of preemption has become much more extensive under
the contemporary global security project.]{.underline} Taking as its
ground a potential, preemption makes up for its absent cause by putting
to work an actual affect in its fight against enemies of "global
humanity", whether it be fundamentalist terrorists or infected birds. As
I elaborated in the prelude to the first chapter, in the case of the
avian flu, states, international organizations, philanthropic actors,
and media mobilized across local, national, regional, and global
networks and rendered the flu an emergency before it became an
emergency.82 The future threat of a pandemic is held in the present in a
perpetual state of potential emergency. Hence, the fact that the
pandemic has not yet happened does not mean that it is no less present
and real.

[Preemption is also the point where security meets capital in a world
interlocked by webs of life, death, and debt]{.underline}. As Randy
Martin notes, [preemption (i.e., bringing future into the present) has
been the guiding principle for U.S. fiscal policy since the late
1970s]{.underline}.83 Before it becomes a blueprint for action against
terrorists, [preemption is put to work as the operational logic in
tandem with the rise of finance and speculative capitalism]{.underline}.
Martin argues that the [new financial service industries that emerged
after the demise of Bretton Woods made a virtue out of risk while
speculation was being installed as a productive force for a globally
circulating economy of credit and debt. Ruled by risk management and
harvesting volatility for gain, finance]{.underline}, as Martin
explains, [creates the environment wherein all investments are made on
the basis of anticipated price movements in the future. Investment by
taking risks today requires a new belief in the future: a belief that
the future will not be unpredictably different, but that it will be
calculably the same]{.underline}.84 In this context, inflation is
treated as a distortion to the economic environment that renders loss
unpredictable. Monetarism, which emphasizes regulating the amount of
money in circulation, is the form preemptive action takes in the realm
of political economy. It becomes the predominant policy tool to
guarantee that the worth of investment portfolios would not be
undermined. What makes the fight against inflation resemble contemporary
wars against undefined enemies is that, like terror, Martin notes,
inflation needs only to be present in prospect for its menacing effects
to be felt. In both cases, [preemption converts potential threats into
actual conflicts making "contingencies of the future to be lived out in
present, blurring the distinction between the not-yet and the
now]{.underline}."85 [It transforms future uncertainty into present
risk---where risk denotes the expected outcomes that can be quantified
in terms of likelihood and value]{.underline}.

In her account of biotechnology and capitalism under contemporary
neoliberal rule, Melinda Cooper provides a similar account to Martin's
and explores the way in which [governing through contingency by
rendering uncertainty productive for power and profit becomes the
defining feature of contemporary politics of security and capital
accumulation]{.underline}.86 Distinguishing neoliberalism from Keynesian
understanding of growth, Cooper suggests that unlike the latter---where
the neoclassical presumption of market equilibrium is treated as a law
of nature---[neoliberalism is premised on non-equilibrium
models]{.underline}. As she explains

Where welfare state biopolitics speaks the language of Gaussian curves
and normalizable risk, [neoliberal theories of economic growth are more
likely to be interested in the concepts of the non-normalizable accident
and the fractal curve]{.underline}. Where Keynesian economics attempts
to safeguard the productive economy against fluctuations of financial
capital, neoliberalism installs speculation at the very core of
production. 87

What is striking in these analyses of risk and government through
contingency is the temporal framework that is enacted through the
hegemonic articulation of preemption as the meeting point of
accumulation strategies and global governance of in/securities. Security
entails a relation to the future, but the nature of this relation does
not remain the same because the way in which the future is assessed,
calculated, and mastered can take different forms.88 As Massumi usefully
notes, "\[p\]reemption is not prevention." 89 [Preemption entails
bringing the future into the present rather than acting in the present
to avoid an occurrence in the future]{.underline}. In the preemptive
framework, [the consequences precede the actualization of the event:
potential threats ---the specter of future inflation that would shake
the confidence in the value of investment portfolios or the specter of a
terrorist strike---are rendered with a tangible presence that call for
preemptive strikes]{.underline}. [Preemption, hence, puts in place a
specific form of relation to the future: contingency, uncertainty
entailed by the notion of future---future as what is yet to
come---arrives in its coded form as an already written
future]{.underline}. [Future as present risk]{.underline} [gets
integrated within the realm of the calculable, measurable, and the
profitable. Codified as risk, uncertainty becomes an opportunity to be
cashed in the market place of global values]{.underline}.90

### Link -- Failed States 

#### The affirmative's discourse of "failed states" legitimizes an interventionist epistemology that effaces difference, makes north-south inequality inevitable, and is self-fulfilling

**Eisenträger '12** (Stian Eisenträger, MA student in IR, board member
at International Reporter, a Norwegian NGO, 3-27-12, "Failed State or
Failed Label?: The Concealing Concept and the Case of Somalia,"
<http://www.e-ir.info/2012/03/27/failed-state-or-failed-label-the-concealing-concept-and-the-case-of-somalia/>)

The end of the Cold War shaped a new international political context
where the issues of democracy and human rights were brought out from the
internal to the external scene. The weakened role of the Soviet Union
gave the United States the possibility to increase its global influence.
In this context *the absence of effective government* emerged on the
world political agenda together with the concept of the "failed state"
(Akpinarli 2009). Boutros Boutros-Gali and Kofi Annan, the former
Secretaries-General of the UN, used the "failed state" term as early as
in 1990, although the General Assembly or the Security Council never
used it. Somalia, which was a typical case of the absence of effective
government, was described by the UN without the use of the term "failed
state". The concept was then applied for the first time in the article
"Saving Failed States" published in the winter edition of Foreign Policy
Magazine in 1992-1993 (Helman & Ratner). This article, which was written
in the post-Cold War context with its high aspirations for democracy,
human rights, the more active role of the United Nations in safeguarding
collective security and the emergence of the United States' as the
leading agenda-setting actor, established the basic concept and the
paradigm. [Although some have tried to incorporate "failed states" in
international law, the term is highly debated because of the
neo-colonial notion attached to it]{.underline} (Akpinarli 2009, 87-89).
According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, [the word "fail" can have a
range of different meanings: "to lose strength", "to fade or die away",
"to stop functioning normally", "to fall short", "to be or become absent
or inadequate", "to be unsuccessful" and "to become bankrupt or
insolvent"]{.underline} (Merriam-Webster 2011). Thus, I would argue that
[the word is too imprecise to be meaningful in our attempt to broaden
our understanding of the world. In addition, the word is heavily
value-laden and has loads of negative connotations attached to it, and
therefore I find it unsuitable to use in science.]{.underline} That
journalists and politicians still use the term, which is both catchy and
tabloid, is understandable when we take into consideration the rather
brutal limitations of time and space these two occupational groups have
in their struggle to reach their audiences. Nevertheless, numbers of
scholars have used and still use the failed state label, many even
without engaging critically with the term (Bates 2008; Ghani & Lockhart
2008; Holzgrefe & Keohane 2003, just to mention a few). The urge to
"fix": Securitization and intervention [The failed state paradigm
implies that there is something that needs to be "fixed" or "saved" --
of course by "good" liberal democratic external forces.]{.underline}
"Preventing states from failing, and rescuing those that do fail, are
(...) strategic and moral imperatives", Robert I. Rotberg (2002)
proclaims in an article with the dramatic title "Failed States in a
World of Terror" (the argument is elaborated in his book, bearing the
same title). One can feel the notion of "the white mans burden". [One of
the most neoliberal contributions in the failed states debate is
probably that of Ashraf Ghani & Clare Lockhart (2008, 124) who in their
book "Fixing failed states" boldly declare that "today states must
fulfil their citizens' aspirations for inclusion and development and
also carry out a constellation of interrelated functions".]{.underline}
They conclude that states "in the world today" should perform ten key
functions, which are: 1) Rule of law; 2) A monopoly of the legitimate
means of violence; 3) Administrative control; 4) Sound management of
public finances; 5) Investments in human capital; 6) Creation of
citizenship rights through social policy; 7) Provision of infrastructure
services; 8) Formation of a market; 9) Management of public assets; 10)
Effective public borrowing. So now when we have the list, can we just go
out in the world and start "fixing"? [Fixing "failed states" is a
dangerous exercise: For many policymakers the failed state label
contributes to open up for and make a good excuse for military and other
interventions.]{.underline} Petra Minnerop shows how the US throughout
the second half of the 20^th^ century developed several terms, for
example "rogue states", for "states to which it ascribed a high threat
potential as regards the United States and international security"
(2003). [In the years to follow after the 1992 article in Foreign Policy
Magazine the international community, with the US in the leading role,
carried out military interventions in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq on
the basis that the chaotic situation in these states poses a threat to
the US and international security in general.]{.underline} The terms
"failed state", "rogue state" and "war on terror" have all been given
prominent roles in the public debate. As Akpinarli also remarks, [these
concepts have been invented by the North to "solve" problems in the
South, as well as to advocate for and justify military interventions to
protect international peace and security]{.underline} (Akpinarli 2009).
I would argue that the concept rather causes more trouble than it solves
-- not only in terms of military intervention, but also by keeping
"failed" states in the margins of international relations. It would not
be an exaggeration to claim that [the labelling of "failed states" is a
prime example of what the Copenhagen School of Security has dubbed
*securitization*.]{.underline} The founding fathers of this concept
point out that "a discourse that takes form of presenting something to
an existential threat to the referent object does not by itself create
securitization -- this is a *securitizing move*, but the issue is
securitized only if and when the audience accepts it as such." (Buzan et
al. 1998, 25). The audience -- in this instance, ordinary citizens in
the North -- has to a large extent accepted the "failed state" paradigm,
especially with reference to Somalia. Both the media and the large
organizations working with/in/for the "failed state" are acting as
agents for the securitizing actors -- that is the governments in the
North, especially the United States' government. Somalia has been among
the top five on the list since the first Failed States Index was
published in 2005, and since 2008 Somalia has had the dubious honour of
being the world's "most failed state". Whether it is possible to measure
a state's "failure" is a question that probably requires a book to be
answered. Since 2005 the magazine and Fund for Peace have ranked the
world's countries after measuring the following variables: Demographic
pressures, refugees/IDPs, group grievance, human flight, uneven
development, economic decline, delegitimization of the state, public
services, human rights, security apparatus, factionalized elites and
external intervention (Fund for Peace 2011). No doubt that all these
measurements may give a good indicator of how the situation is in a
number of countries. However, my point and critique is that [the index
fails in grasping the vast empirical variations within the research
object itself]{.underline} in the case of Somalia. Using the juridical
state of Somalia as the object of analysis without looking under the
surface becomes a serious hindrance of capturing the full picture.
Somalia's image problem As Michael C. Williams (2003, 527) excellently
points out, "[Security policies today are constructed not only with the
question of their linguistic legitimation in mind; they now are
increasingly decided upon in relation to acceptable image-rhetorics". In
this context we can identify the visualization of the verbal rhetoric of
the failed state paradigm. The presentation of "failed states" is often
accompanied with depictions of a war-torn hell-hole, and the Foreign
Policy Magazine takes the lead by presenting the Failed States Index
together with a collection of photos appearing under the splash heading:
"Postcards from Hell"]{.underline} (Foreign Policy Magazine 2011). When
the Failed States Index is referred to by other news outlets, this kind
of presentation is reproduced (for a recent example, see: BBC 2011a). I
have yet to see an example of any media organization to examine the
Index more closely. Only telling one side of the story is a serious
problem. We can compare the use of the "failed state" label with how
Somalia is depicted in the daily media coverage. [How many times can you
remember to have seen the pictures from Somalia, the disaster zone, with
starving children, heavily armed Islamist fighters and dead people being
dragged through the streets by a cheering mob?]{.underline} Quite a few
times, I suppose. On the other hand, how many times have you seen
pictures from Somalia showing farmers working in their fields, smiling
and playful children, or the beach in Mogadishu crowded with both men,
women and children? Probably not at all. Of course, the pictures of the
disaster zone of Somalia are real and by every journalistic standard it
is right to publish such pictures. The practice becomes a problem when
these are the only pictures that are being shown, when the stories about
starving children and dangerous terrorists are the only stories that are
being told about Somalia outside Somalia. [This misrepresentation in the
media can for a large part be attributed to the "failed state" label
that is burn-marked on the country, and which pay so little attention to
the variations within the geographical area that makes up the state of
Somalia. When a statement is repeated enough times, it becomes a
"truth".]{.underline} Politicians and scholars, as well as the media
itself are responsible for this brand marking, and the process is
self-reinforcing. The situation has reached the point where members of
the Somali diaspora community in Norway has established an organization
with one of its main goals to adjust the picture that has been made of
Somalia and the Somali people (Iftiin -- somalisk-norsk kunnskapssenter
2011). Somalia has a serious image-problem -- literally. [Not only does
this put the country in risk of external intervention, it also
contributes to keep Somalia and much of its population in the margins of
international relations]{.underline}. There is a lack of representation
of the people inhabiting the territory of the Somali Republic, both
because the TFG lacks authority, but also because of the non-recognition
of the de facto states of Somaliland and Puntland. Here we have to
functional geopolitical entities that are not represented in the UN nor
in other global or regional institutions. Furthermore [foreign investors
and tourists stay away because of the perception and understanding of
the whole of Somalia being a "failed state".]{.underline} Africa and the
Knowledge of Non-Being In his classic work Orientalism, Edward Said
(2003 \[1978\]) scrutinize the history and nature of Western attitudes
towards the East. He argues that [orientalism is a powerful European
ideological creation and a way for dealing with the "otherness" of
Eastern culture, customs and beliefs]{.underline}. Achille Mbembe
applies much of the same argumentation in his critique of Africanism. He
says that historically, [the West has constructed its own civilization,
enlightenment and progress through the "others]{.underline}", thus
non-Western cultures, and especially Africa. Mbembe argues that: "Africa
as an idea, a concept, has historically served, and still continues to
serve, as a polemical argument for the West's desperate desire to assert
its difference from the rest of the world" (Mbembe 2001, 2). One of the
challenges in grasping how things work outside the Western world is that
many, [if not even all, of the concepts we use when describing the
universe of International Relations is based in Western history and
thinking]{.underline}. Max Weber's famous definition of the state as "a
human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the
legitimate use of physical force within a given territory (Weber et al.
1991, 78). In Western thinking, [Weber's definition represents the
*idea* of an "ideal state", and it seems like many have the perception
that Western states fit into this idea or norm]{.underline}. When
analyzing states in Africa, this is revealed when African states are
compared with the *idea* of an "ideal state", which is believed to be a
prototype of a Western state -- leading to the focus on African states'
absences, lacks and incompleteness, as weak or failed. In this way
Mbembe's analysis is straight to the point when he states that "while we
feel we know nearly everything that African states, societies, and
economies *are not*, we still know absolutely nothing about *what they
actually are*". [Our knowledge of Africa is to a large degree based on
the knowledge of non-being]{.underline} (Mbembe 2001, 9). But claiming
that the "Western state" resembles the Weberian state, or even that the
"Western state" is the norm, is highly problematic. First of all, every
state has its own specific features, and the higher the degree of
generalization, the more problematic it is. Secondly, [Weber's state is
an idea of a state that has never existed in practice -- even not in
Europe or North America -- for example when we take into account the
important fact that private violence and private security has existed
through modern history, and even today.]{.underline} Abrahamsen &
Williams (2010), Colás & Mabee (2010) and Thomson (1994) are among
several scholars who have demonstrated how private violence and private
security takes form in e.g. private companies, criminal organizations
and vigilante groups. If the states in Europe and North America are to
be judged by the same standards as the states in Africa, many of these
could get the "failed" label as well. Noam Chomsky, for example, has
turned the tables in his book "Failed States", where he shows that the
US shares features with other "failed states" (2007). But [does the
"failed state" label provide us with more and better insight into how
different states work; does it enlighten us in any way? Definitely not.
The label conceals more than it enlightens]{.underline}. Abrahamsen &
Williams (2010) argues that we must look beyond the state when analysing
security issues in Africa. I would argue that we must look both beyond
and within the state also when we want to analyse states in Africa, and
especially Somalia.

### Link -- Food Security 

#### The 1ac's apocalyptic famine discourse is a weapon of war -- the internalization of emergency has resulted in a bunkerization of aid, creating a system of winners and losers that exacerbate internal tensions -- that increases the probability of war 

**Duffield '12** (Mark Duffield, Global Insecurities Centre, School of
Sociology, Politics and International Studies, University of Bristol,
UK, "Challenging environments: Danger, resilience and the aid industry
From protection to resilience" Security Dialogue, 43(5) 475--492)

Internalizing emergency

This section provides a genealogical sketch of the transition from the
modernist view of disaster as something external to society to seeing it
as intrinsic to the internal functioning of society itself, and thus
requiring urgent governance. By the end of the Cold War, the disaster
zone had been reworked as a morally conflicted space of predatory
winners and hapless losers. Working through such categories, [the
internalization of emergency provided a powerful moral justification for
liberal interventionism and the post-Cold War expansion of the aid
industry into challenging environments. It rationalized aid workers own
'freeing up' or exposure to new risk environments and the willingness of
many to embrace this opportunity.]{.underline} Modernism banished God
from disasters; rather than a divine punishment for human failings, they
were reworked as accidents or unusual occurrences. [The postmodernist
turn]{.underline}, however, [has brought an eschatology of human folly
back into the equation]{.underline} (Duffield and Evans, 2011). Since
the 1970s, [the modernist conception of disasters as]{.underline} more
or less [random events outside of normal society has been progressively
abandoned.]{.underline} [Emergency has been internalized and normalized
as integral to the functioning of society.]{.underline} [Human agency
and choice have once again become important]{.underline}-- [hence the
need to govern their outcomes.]{.underline} [While the present
climate-change debate epitomizes this shift]{.underline} (Grove, 2010),
[earlier changes in the interpretation of famine anticipate this
move.]{.underline} During the 1970s, it was still common for
policymakers to regard famine as resulting from absolute and externally
induced food shortages. The work of Amartya Sen (1981) has been
influential in shifting our understanding of famine from outside to
inside society. [Rather than absolute shortages, famine now resides in
the unequal social capital and degrees of market exclusion]{.underline}
that befall individuals and define their different abilities to access
that food which is available in the marketplace. [Rather than
socio-economic reform and income redistribution, Sen's]{.underline}
entitlement [approach emphasizes 'individual inclusion and choice-making
capacities']{.underline} (Chandler, forthcoming).

[The behaviour and choices made by famine victims]{.underline}, together
with the social and educational assets they can call upon,
[have]{.underline} also [become important for disaster
management]{.underline}. Alex de Waal's (1989) influential study of the
1984--5 famine [in Darfur]{.underline}, for example, revealed that
[humanitarian aid only supplied around 12% of the total food
consumed.]{.underline} [What the affected communities did for
themselves, their coping strategies, was shown to be more important than
the efforts of the international aid industry. These strategies ranged
from gathering famine foods]{.underline} -- that is, wild plants and
roots not normally consumed -- [through livestock sales, to selective
labour migration. This shift in focus from lives to livelihoods in
relation to famine was part of a wider reorientation of development
generally towards the centrality of the choices made by
individuals]{.underline} (Chambers, 1987; Solesbury, 2003). [Development
became less about material advancement and]{.underline}, as reflected in
the establishment of the UNDP's Human Development Index, [more focused
on creating supporting market environments and programmes to help poor
people make the right choices]{.underline} (Booth, 1993). Since
individuals can make the wrong choices, with [the postmodernist turn
moral judgement now infuses relief and development.]{.underline}

[The ability to make bad choices]{.underline}, however, [is not confined
to famine victims]{.underline}. By the end of the 1980s, it had been
recognized that [market failure and lack of social capital did not
exhaust possibilities. Famines could also be deliberately
created]{.underline} (De Waal, 1990). [In Sudan]{.underline}, for
example, it was discovered that [famines had winners and losers, and
that the former were capable of maintaining famine conditions, if not
creating them.]{.underline} David Keen's (1994) important study of
famine in southwestern Sudan during the 1980s, for example, showed how
[local elites]{.underline}, who benefitted from the asset sales and
cheap labour of famine victims, [worked to sustain famine
conditions]{.underline}. Thus, [while famine victims could make good
choices]{.underline} regarding how to cope, [disaster zones]{.underline}
[were]{.underline} also [home to predators who]{.underline}, on the
basis of conscious economic and political calculation,
[could]{.underline} both [gain from famine and]{.underline}, indeed,
[use it as a weapon of war]{.underline} (Duffield, 1991). By the end of
the 1980s, in Africa at least, [emergency had been internalized within
the socio-economic fabric of society and the disaster zone reworked as a
complex and conflicted moral terrain of winners and losers]{.underline}
(Duffield, 1993). Helped by Band Aid and the public anger regarding
international inaction over the mid-1980s famine in Ethiopia, by the
closing years of the Cold War [the internalization of emergency and
revelation of predatory human agency had created a powerful moral
incentive for humanitarian intervention in the internal wars of the
global south.]{.underline} In opposition to modernist conservatism, [aid
agencies were]{.underline} widely [encouraged to put the saving of life
'above any political consideration or bureaucratic
constraint']{.underline} (Duffield, 2001: xx). However, while widely
supported, [the subsequent post-1989 surge in liberal interventionism
effectively downgraded erstwhile third-world sovereignty over a wider
front]{.underline} (Tamás, 2000). At the same time, [oppositional
groups]{.underline} that had been courted as liberation movements during
the period of superpower rivalry [quickly lost political legitimacy with
its passing]{.underline} (Anderson, 1996). [Within the New World
Order]{.underline}, save that sanctioned by the UN or leading liberal
states, [political violence was no longer acceptable. Changing attitudes
to sovereignty, international law and political violence created the
terrain for a marked expansion of the aid industry.]{.underline} As
Antonio Donini (1996: 6) remarked, 'recent years have witnessed a kind
of double lifting of inhibitions that had been largely suppressed by the
Cold War's rules of the game: the inhibition to wage war and the
inhibition to intervene'. At the same time, however, [the dissolving of
modernist constraints was coterminous with the normalization of working
in ongoing conflict and chronic insecurity. The post-Cold War era would
expose aid workers to a new systemic risk terrain, the implications of
which are still unfolding.]{.underline}

Reflecting the postmodernist turn, the idea of a complex emergency first
entered UN usage towards the end of the 1980s in Mozambique (Duffield,
1994: 9). In 1989 it was extended to South Sudan and, following the
first Gulf War and the creation of the UN's Department of Humanitarian
Affairs in 1992, subsequently gained wider circulation. While lacking an
agreed definition, [a complex emergency is usually regarded as a
chronic, multicausal humanitarian crisis involving varying combinations
of political, economic, environmental, conflict and peacekeeping
factors]{.underline} (United Nations, 1994: 23). [As]{.underline} [such,
complex emergencies require a system-wide response on the part of the
aid industry.]{.underline} [However]{.underline}, as Hugo Slim has
pointed out, ['complexity']{.underline} in this case [does not refer to
any new misery inflicted on their victims. The strategies involved
were]{.underline} essentially [the same as those that had killed
millions during the civil wars of the 20th century.]{.underline}
[Complexity 'refers to an increase in the difficulties experienced by
outsiders in the international community who seek to respond to such
wars as essentially non-combatant, humanitarian and peace-promoting
third parties']{.underline} (Slim, quoted in Collinson and Elhawary,
2012: 11). As a logistical metaphor, a complex emergency speaks to the
difficulty of coordinating system-wide aid responses in the new threat
environment produced by the demise of modernist institutions and
restraints. As a constantly updated and 'improved' logistical diagram,
[the complex emergency has undergone a continuous process of change and
adaptation, from negotiated access to stabilization, through to the War
on Terror and the advent of drone warfare.]{.underline} Against this
backdrop of organizational change, [the increasing bunkerization of the
aid industry has been a constant feature.]{.underline}

### [Link -- Food Security]{.underline} 

#### Justifying food policies through catastrophic geopolitical consequences naturalizes a liberal world order that's the root cause of industrial agriculture and environment collapse 

**Le Billon et al '14** (Melanie Sommerville, doctoral student in the
Department of Geography at the University of British Columbia, Jamey
Essex, Assistant Professor of Geography at the University of Windsor, &
Philippe Le Billon, Professor at the University of British Columbia with
the Department of Geography, "The 'Global Food Crisis' and the
Geopolitics of Food Security," *Geopolitics* 19:2, 2014)

Since 2007, [rising prices and pronounced volatility in international
food markets have combined to dramatically refigure global food
security]{.underline} [and produce]{.underline} what many have termed [a
'global food crisis']{.underline}. [Driven by a variety of factors
including demand for agrofuel]{.underline}s, the intersection of food
with oil and financial markets, the [steady erosion of agroecological
systems and social safety nets, and pronounced inequalities in global
agro-food systems, these food price shifts have had profound social and
political effects]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} many [poorer countries,
price spikes led to domestic unrest and widespread food
riots]{.underline}, prompting emergency market-control measures by
several governments. [Increased unrest]{.underline} and rising food
bills [led many governments to reconsider their
agricultural]{.underline} and food [policies]{.underline}, with
exporting states shutting down food surplus shipments, [and several
import-dependent countries further investing in offshore food
production]{.underline}, [a practice linked to a broader 'global land
grab' with severe repercussions for small-scale farmers and the rural
poor]{.underline}. For many observers, [these combined social, economic,
and political features have been read as the markers of a new 'global
food crisis', which has continued into 2013, and shows few signs of
imminent resolution]{.underline}. Internationally, [concerns about a new
global food crisis resulted in new funding streams]{.underline},
combining overseas development assistance with philanthropic capital,
[and emphasising the development opportunities associated with
agriculture]{.underline} as the seat of rural economic growth. [These
new capital flows]{.underline}, in combination with strengthened
activism by agrarian social movements, [have reshuffled the global
governance architecture]{.underline} around agriculture and food
security, creating new political actors and allegiances and
strengthening others. Yet with almost 870 million people continuing to
suffer from chronic and acute hunger, [there are genuine questions about
whether the root causes of global food insecurity have been
addressed]{.underline}, and indeed whether a solution to the crisis is
within grasp.1 [Price shocks]{.underline} and the broader 'food crisis'
[have brought considerable attention to the geopolitical dimensions of
food security and the shifting political geographies]{.underline} of
agro-food systems more generally. In both popular and
[policy]{.underline} forums, [food security increasingly appears as a
matter of urgent geopolitical calculation and strategy]{.underline},
[and as an issue central to discussions]{.underline} of national and
human security, [climate change]{.underline}, development and global
inequality. [Leveraging neo-Malthusian predictions]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} an imminent descent into [socio-political
chaos]{.underline} amidst growing global food supply-demand imbalances,
[such narratives call forth liberal humanitarian]{.underline}
[interventions promising development for the hungry and
security]{.underline} for the (privileged) rest of us in one tidy
package. These doubly securitised framings are now being used to press
forward technological and market-driven solutions to food insecurity
with new urgency. [Even as the global food crisis]{.underline} [has
offered a potent opportunity to challenge dominant agro-food political
paradigms]{.underline}, then, [it has also tended to reinstall
them]{.underline}. [Political geographic knowledges and geopolitical
framings]{.underline} [are not neutral in this process]{.underline},
[but rather are deeply inscribed within it]{.underline}. [This
re-prioritisation of food security]{.underline} within political
discussions [and the geopolitical agenda appears to have gone largely
unnoticed by political geographers]{.underline}. Indeed, [agriculture
and food issues]{.underline} have [long occupied a somewhat marginal
position]{.underline} within the subdiscipline, a curious situation
given the growing attention they have garnered from scholars elsewhere
in geography in recent decades.2 [Our aim in this paper is to
begin]{.underline} [reversing this pattern of neglect]{.underline} and
filling the gap that has resulted. Our paper proceeds in two main parts.
In the first section, [we examine the geopolitical framings of food
security]{.underline} [that have come to dominate popular and policy
narratives]{.underline} in the last few years, [and demonstrate the
importance of critical political geography approaches for unseating
these dominant narratives]{.underline}. We argue that [these framings
promulgate a neo-Malthusian]{.underline} and securitised [reading of
food security that privileges technological]{.underline} and
[market-extending responses deployed through further liberal
humanitarian interventions]{.underline}. Rather than interrupting the
structural conditions underpinning the current food crisis, [such
instances of 'neoliberal geopolitics' obscure both the continuing
relevance of questions regarding inequality and domination within the
global agro-food system, and the role of crisis narratives in
depoliticising recent interventions]{.underline} into this system. [We
call for critical political geography perspectives to attend to the
central role of geopolitical discourses in constituting the political
economy]{.underline} of agro-food production and consumption, and to
highlight counter- and alter-geopolitics readings of food security. In
the second section, we take up this challenge by examining four key
areas where such approaches can help question the status quo, while also
finding common ground with contemporary research in agro-food studies.
In so doing, [we hope to inspire political]{.underline} [geographers to
direct more attention to food and agriculture as important areas of
geopolitical inquiry]{.underline}.

### Link -- Hegemony 

#### The concept of benign hegemony is whitewashing of brutal imperial violence and coercive social Darwinism

**Jalbert '13** (Elie Jalbert, BA honors in anthropology at Concordia
University, "Emergency as Security: Liberal Empire at Home and Abroad,"
pp 31-2, GENDER MODIFIED)

[U.S. history is fraught with contradiction. There seems to have been a
persistent divide between its represented self-image and its actions in
the world]{.underline}. It has viewed itself as a land of the free,
where individuals have free reign to maximize their wealth and pursue
happiness without the constraints of government inhibiting their
freedom, while ignoring the way in which government typically enforced
the rights of one group over another (McCaull, 1976) and provided the
infrastructure and investments that made development possible (Novak,
2008; Limerick, 2012). [It has promoted its exceptional nature and
asserted its difference from all previous empires, advocating
fundamental human rights and opportunity for all, though its society has
been one of profound segregation]{.underline} (Perlstein, 2006), [with a
foreign policy more often than not brutal, repressive, and indeed
essentially imperialistic]{.underline} (Chomsky, 1998; McCoy, 2009)---[a
foreign policy that then in turn transformed domestic policy by
importing its policing practices back home]{.underline} (McCoy &
Scarano, 2009; Chomsky, 1999; De Genova, 2010; Steinmetz, 2005, pp.
357--361). [Founded on the genocide of its Indigenous population, the
U.S. has defined its brave and free persona by glorifying its revolution
that shook off the empire's grip, yet has been leading a global
counterinsurgent "War on Terrorism" that defines resistance as a threat
that must be eliminated]{.underline}. One such contradiction---[the
contrast of a projected benign history of the quest for freedom and
rights with the reality of American ascent to global
domination]{.underline}---is discussed by Novak (2008). In addressing
what he calls the "myth of the 'weak' American state", he shows how
[there is "an almost pathological tendency to confuse American ideal
with historical political reality," and a constant tension between
"liberty and power, freedom and authority, contract and coercion, and
law and violence]{.underline}" (Novak, 2008, p. 754). In the author's
view, the myth of an American weak state has its roots in an
exceptionalist view of the U.S as being a new world exempted from
previous political histories by a "so-called 'natural' development of
individualism, private rights, civil society, free labour, and a free
economy" (Novak, 2008, pp. 754--755). McCaull (1976) considers [this
sense of exceptionalism to be underpinned by a Spencerian theory of
social evolution that presents American industry as the pinnacle
of]{.underline} ~~man's~~ [\[humanity's\] ever ascending rise to
perfection]{.underline}. [This "social Darwinism" that applied
biological notions of survival of the fittest to human society provided
legitimacy for rapacious and competitive social and economic practices
by presenting them as a natural and normal continuation of evolution
toward complexity]{.underline}. Spencer's theory was thus co-opted by
American industrialists as a powerful "scientific" tool of laissez faire
capitalism legitimation, [reminiscent of the Malthusian arguments
discussed earlier, that rooted their reasoning in the laws of nature so
as to give them an air of inevitability]{.underline}.

### Link -- HIV/AIDS 

#### The aff's seemingly liberal move to combat HIV only furthers global securitization -- turns the case 

**Ailio '13** (Jaako Ailio, doctoral student in management,
international relations, and political science at the University of
Tampere, 2013, "Liberal Thanatopolitics and the HIV/AIDS Pandemic,"
*Alternatives: Global, Local, Political* Volume 38 Issue 3)

[Despite the exceptional triumph of the liberal response within the
HIV/AIDS pandemic, especially when compared to responses to other
infectious diseases, there have been some ''illiberal'' exclusions.
These exclusions have been concentrated around the disparity of life
chances resulting from the fact that successful treatment, which in
prosperous Western liberal realms has made HIV infection more a chronic
condition than an immediate threat to life, has not been as widely
accessible in the Global South]{.underline}. While commitment to
universal treatment has been affirmed for a long time, the concurrent
protection of patent rights by pharmaceutical companies and the
protection of Western health care systems from a flood of HIV-positive
immigrants through various travel restrictions and immigration
requirements has frequently produced contrary consequences.30 As a
result, at least those [HIV-positive people who have found themselves
excluded from access to treatment can be considered, from a biopolitical
perspective, to be embodiments of life abandoned to death in an
Agambenian sense. These people have been subjected to the sovereign
exception and thus excluded from all the positive content of the global
HIV/AIDS community by being captured in the ''zone of indistinction
between outside and inside, exclusion and inclusion]{.underline}.''31

On the other hand, as many now suggest, [in the recent years the
relevance of the biopolitical production of abandonment through
sovereign exception in the case of HIV/AIDS pandemic has
decreased]{.underline}.32 This indeed seems to be the case as on more
and more occasions the campaigning and lobbying of the global AIDS
activist and influential international organizations, such as the Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), has been able to change
how things are done. For instance, through campaigning and lobbying, the
access to treatment was framed as a human right, which made it possible
to impose certain limitations on the implementation of intellectual
property rights regarding ARVs. Consequently, a space was opened for the
production and purchase of much cheaper generic drugs. This has been
capitalized on by states outside the prosperous West, most notably
Brazil, which has become a model of efficiency in providing nearly
universal ARVs by cooperating with activists, development agencies, and
the pharmaceutical industry itself. As people grow more resistant,
questions about the future availability of newer drug therapies remain.
Nevertheless, Brazil's model has become celebrated not only within the
Global South but also gradually accepted, at least to a certain extent,
among the governments of the West, who now mostly prefer generic drugs
within their global health initiatives, as well as among the
pharmaceutical companies themselves.33

In addition, in the case of the HIV/AIDS-related travel restrictions and
immigration requirements, [the activists and the international expert
organizations seem to have attained many of their goals]{.underline}.
This is true especially regarding the liberal democracies of the Western
world: in these countries, at present there is a strong compliance with
individual rights when dealing with foreign HIV-positive people whose
condition is no longer considered to be worth special attention. As has
been recommended by expert organizations and demanded by activists, [in
these countries HIV infection of a foreigner does not bring on the
suspension of one's basic right to mobility]{.underline}, as the
foreigner is treated in the same way as any other visitor/immigrant
regardless of HIV status.34 Recently, also the United States, the most
notable exception to the rule in this regard within the liberal realm,
eliminated its travel restrictions based on HIV status and thus
finalized the process that was already launched by the George Bush
administration.35

What should we, then, make of the prospects of the increased extension
of rights even into the traditional zones of abandonment in the case of
the HIV/AIDS pandemic? [Does the penetration of rights into these zones
have the potential to prevent the rendering of people as embodiments of
life abandoned to death? The answer, unfortunately, is no]{.underline}.
In an aporetic fashion, [the penetration of rights to these traditional
abandonment producing zones only changes the form in which life
abandoned to death is produced within the pandemic]{.underline}. As a
consequence, [the foundational abandonment is no longer produced through
the Agambenian type of exception but becomes an inherent quality of the
liberal policies themselves, making it possible to speak about a liberal
thanatopolitics.]{.underline}

This becomes evident when the consequences of the penetration of rights
into the abandonment-producing zones are viewed from the perspective of
how the dispositif of the person clashes with the dehumanizing
tendencies of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In order to bring out this clash,
it is necessary to emphasize three points.

First, it must be stressed that [AIDS ravages the subjectivity of an
individual as ''the disease destroys the very idea of an identity-making
border: the difference between self and other, internal and external,
inside and outside]{.underline}.''36 This refers to the fact that an
immune system's CD4 T cells, in which the HIV virus resides, have under
normal conditions the task of activating and directing the immune
defenses, but in the case of the HIV virus the activation of these cells
paradoxically makes them more hospitable to the virus and actually helps
the virus to replicate. It is therefore incorrect to say that the virus
simply evades the immune system; rather, the virus uses the immune
system's own mechanisms to harm it. [What gets affected is not just
health but the entire ontological scheme, as the defense mechanism that
is thought to guarantee individual's integrity in the face of other
organisms reveals its deficiencies by itself assisting the progression
of the virus which eventually will undermine the system completely,
exposing the body to every germ, and causing the body to
implode]{.underline}. Thus, functioning in the mode strictly opposed to
that of immunity, which internalizes the external, [AIDS turns the body
inside out by ''externalization of the inside]{.underline}.''37

Second, and against the first point, it is necessary to understand how
[the liberal framing of access to treatment as a human right functions
along the lines of the dispositif of the person. As a result, the logic
of intervention and the limit that would need to be transgressed in
order to overcome AIDS once and for all become fundamentally the same.
This is a consequence of the foundational fracture experienced by the
idea of a strictly bordered individual, which, in a paradoxical manner,
becomes remedied by framing the access to treatment as a right of
everyone as far as one is this strictly bordered individual, that is, a
person. The paradoxical consequences of the framing become visible
especially in the resource-poor settings of the Global South where this
framing inadequately pharmaceuticalizes health in an individualizing
manner]{.underline}.38 As the pandemic has followed the fault lines of
the long-term economic processes, these are settings in which the health
infrastructure does not exist and [the rolling out of HIV/AIDS drugs
becomes a matter of innovative projects and people's ability to attach
themselves to these projects]{.underline}.39 This is more easily said
than done, as [the treatment of HIV infection with ARVs has a long-term
therapeutic character requiring that patients fully adhere to their
treatment and that there is a medical apparatus in place that documents
and monitors patients' response to the drugs]{.underline}. This is
essential as over time the HIV in patient's body becomes resistant to
certain ARVs, and thus the drug cocktail that one is using has to be
altered from time to time in order to keep one in shape and alive. Thus,
[what is demanded from these poor and marginalized people, who form the
majority of the HIV-positive people in the world, is self-discipline and
will to overcome their physical and social situation. What is demanded
is that they actively follow and keep attending the treatments and thus
maintain their personhood, their control over their body, their animal
layer inside them. If they are not able to do this, they fall outside
the benefits of their right to treatment, their right to life, and the
virus will finalize their destiny by making their body take control over
them. These people]{.underline}, as João Biehl has written, ''[are
trapped between two possible destinies: dying of AIDS like the poor and
marginalized do---that is, being animalized---and living
pharmacologically into a future, thereby letting the animal sleep and
preventing it from consuming their flesh]{.underline}.''40

Yet, third, [the paradoxical consequences grow even more mind-twisting
when the disappearance of the state-imposed HIV/AIDS-related mobility
restrictions from the Western liberal realm is addressed. As the right
of the HIV-positive people to be treated as individual persons even
beyond the old sovereign demarcation between the Global South and the
prosperous liberal realm of the West is respected, a space is opened
inside this liberalized realm: a space in which there is little room for
those who are not ''proper persons'' but considerable scope for more
direct forms of violence against these same individuals. The absence of
state-imposed mobility restrictions does not simply mean enhanced life
changes for everyone; for example, for failed asylum seekers, illegal
immigrants, and other foreigners without proper authorization, access to
the health services that HIV-positives need to stay alive is made
difficult if they lack money or other legitimate ways to cover their
health expenses]{.underline}.41

Consequently, [the possibility of living in a liberal realm is granted
mainly to those HIV-positive people who can be trusted to take
responsibility for themselves and for the costs of their own care. For
others, access to adequate health services remains blocked. Respect for
their right to be treated in the same manner as any other individual
person means making them liable human subjects in spite of their
dehumanized condition, pushing them even more certainly toward
abandonment. The more the global efforts to provide assistance have
failed, the more ''illegal'' or ''unauthorized'' these people become in
relation to their access to further assistance. This is where, despite
liberal attempts to keep it in check by emphasizing personal rights,
sovereign violence reappears through the opening created by this very
same emphasis on personal rights. HIV-positive people in their entirety
can never be ensured protection through respect for their rights because
it is these rights that ensure that many of them inevitably fall into a
zone of indistinguishability between full human existence and merely
being alive, a zone in which these people are rendered as targets of
violence.]{.underline}

[It is ultimately here in the zone of indistinguishability between full
human existence and merely being alive that the thanatopolitical
potential of liberalism is actualized. The emphasis on human rights and
non-discriminating policies ends up turning against, and even bringing
death to, those promised enhanced life changes. In the case of the
HIV/AIDS pandemic in particular, life as a whole simply cannot be
immunized through efforts premised on the primacy of, and control by,
the personified human life over the body and the animal layer of life;
the progression of the virus has made it impossible to maintain this
distinction. The insistence on the primacy of the personified human life
leads to HIV-positive people being pushed further from the designated
standards of living by placing these standards beyond their
reach]{.underline}. Thus, [the dynamics of the HIV/AIDS pandemic are the
same for the liberal immunitary dispositif of the person as the HIV
virus itself is for the immune system. The dynamics of the pandemic and
the virus itself are both something that these two immunization
mechanisms cannot handle in the way they are supposed to. In both cases,
immunity is unable to fully protect life.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [in both cases, the mechanisms of the immunization do not
only fail but begin in themselves to contribute to the gradual
destruction of that which they should try to protect]{.underline}. In
the case of the HIV virus, the mechanisms of the immune system help the
virus to replicate and thus destroy the body's integrity in the face of
harmful infections. In the case of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, [the
immunitary mechanism of the person begins to produce paradoxical results
as by including people under its projection it begins to abandon those
same people to the mercy of the HIV virus]{.underline}.

Conclusion

Despite Esposito's reluctance to use the term ''liberal
thanatopolitics,'' the term seems appropriate when describing and
conceptualizing liberal responses to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. This is
especially the case for recent liberal responses to the disparity of
life changes between the prosperous West and the Global South. [When the
extension of rights-based policies to traditional abandonment producing
zones is explored from the perspective of Esposito's immunitary reading
of biopolitics and his elaboration of the dispositif of the person, it
becomes clear that liberal policies are unable to prevent producing
abandonment themselves. This is a result of the insistence on the
primacy of personified human life over living matter as such in the face
of the dehumanizing pandemic, which ends up pushing many HIV-positive
people into a zone of indistinguishability between full human existence
and merely being alive. The power of thanatos is no longer expressed as
an exception but has become an inherent quality of liberal
policies.]{.underline}

[Given this inversion of liberal biopolitics into liberal
thanatopolitics, it is clear that a new course is needed]{.underline}.
However, the persistence of the production of abandonment despite the
extension of rights within abandonment-producing zones means that
innovation will be more difficult than many are willing to admit.
[Better policies will not come from further extension or creation of new
rights to people who are now abandoned. This is because to be fully
human is to be in a relational condition that derives its
intelligibility from the subjugation a person enjoys over the biological
layer of life which connects one to other living beings and
things]{.underline}. As the HIV/AIDS pandemic places this subjugation in
doubt, [anything that tries to protect only the human person is bound to
push at least some HIV positives toward abandonment]{.underline}.
Consequently, innovation must move in the opposite direction, also set
out by Esposito, a direction that tries to work with immunity's
etymological and practical horizon, the community. [As the
thanatopolitical inversion of immunity makes plain, community is not
only a contagious relationship with others, thereby representing a risk
of self-dissolution, but also something that, like immunity, protects
us]{.underline}. Community protects us from the excess of immunity that
appears destined to have thanatopolitical consequences. From this
perspective, community is not something that can be removed without
destroying that which was sought to be protected from the excess of
community in the first place. [Thus, contemporary global efforts to halt
the spread of HIV/AIDS pandemic can only benefit from reactivating the
idea of community. What must be found is the way to place the communal,
the impersonal force of life, rather than the notion of the person, at
the center of protection]{.underline}.

### Link -- Human Rights 

#### Human rights are just an attempt to mystify and recuperate an epistemology of domination which ensures mass violence and colonialism

**Calkivik '10** (Emine Asli Calkivik, PhD in political science from the
University of Minnesota, October 2010, "Dismantling Security,"
<https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/99479/Calkivik_umn_0130E_11576.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>)

[Humanitarian interventions of the 1990s---most significantly the NATO
action in response to the Kosovo crisis in 1999]{.underline}, which was
undertaken in complete defiance of the UN Charter---[and the invasions
of Iraq and Afghanistan heightened the controversies surrounding the
notion of human security]{.underline}. In the face of rising concerns
about the uses and abuses of "The Right of Intervention" to protect
humanity, the principle of the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) was
adopted unanimously at the 2005 UN World Summit. Placing emphasis on the
primary responsibility of the state to protect its citizens, the
principle introduced "the novel idea that the international community
should assist states in this endeavor" and situated armed intervention
within "a broader continuum of measures that the international community
might take to respond to genocide and mass atrocities."55 While its
advocates argue that the R2P shifts the terrain from the rights of
interveners to the rights of victims,56 that it is a useful "diplomatic
tool, or prism, to guide efforts to stem the tide of mass atrocities,"57
and that it is "not a new code for humanitarian intervention... \[but\]
a more positive and affirmative concept of sovereignty as
responsibility,"58 critics continue to assert that human security "would
be best divorced from the notion of 'responsibility to protect'"59 so as
not to become [a basis for legitimizing Western militarism]{.underline}.

It is interesting to note that while its liberal advocates have been
busy trying to find new ways to reformulate human security to shield it
from being corrupted by the not-so-benign international community,
radical critics of global liberal governance have not given up on human
security and the project to relieve suffering and secure the life of the
species. Apprehensive about its neo-colonial implications and the way in
which it has been articulated into liberal and statist projects, even
the most ardent critics of human security have nevertheless refrained
from abandoning the concept altogether. The project to develop [a
"critical human security paradigm]{.underline}" is an example.60 The
central aim of the project is [to investigate how the concept of human
security "can be 'protected' from the hegemonizing narratives of
securitization and neo-liberalism]{.underline}."61 The contributors to
the project examine various conceptions of human security in relation to
the non-Western world and try to develop a global, critical perspective
on the concept of human security that would be attentive to the ways in
which it gets entangled in power relations. Their articles paint a
striking picture of how [human security functions toward reproducing
capitalist relations of power and exploitation, gender hierarchies, and
bio-political forms of rule]{.underline}. Despite the deeply problematic
nature of human security, however, the conclusion offered by the project
is that human security cannot and should not be abandoned. [Such
"radical" efforts beg the question of why thought and action have to be
confined to security in addressing violence. Put differently, if
security itself entails violence, why limit thought on violence to the
framework of security]{.underline}?62

In short, through its multifarious articulations, [security has emerged
as the nodal point of a vast, materially consequential discursive
field]{.underline}. The desire for security is presented as a primary,
unquestionable human need and the overriding goal of politics---both
domestic and international. It has become a commonsense category to such
an extent that even critical minds argue that the action of governments
would deserve few questions when they act in the name of the security of
their citizens.63 [Not only is security posited as a universal desire
and a good that could be attained and enjoyed by all, it is presented as
a natural goal, an end that all human beings by nature
seek.]{.underline} [Self-appointed spokespersons]{.underline}---a vast
network composed of state representatives, international courts, human
rights and humanitarian organizations, diverse groups of NGOs,
intellectuals, and other public figures---[legitimate an array of
political interventions ostensibly undertaken to secure humanity by
fulfilling that natural desire to protect the species' more vulnerable
members.]{.underline}

Security has become an imperative that demands ever more attention and
ever more obedience to its rituals. [The realm within which the machine
of security operates has expanded exponentially to include all forms of
life, from the microbe upwards.]{.underline} Wherever one looks, one is
faced with a security warning. Security has transmogrified into a first
principle that one has to heed as one eats, shops, works, or travels.
"We are not a security guard company. We sell a concept of security,"64
says the president of the U.S. security firm Westec. Perhaps this public
relations catch phrase best summarizes the sovereignty of security
within the contemporary global context. We may not know what it means,
what it entails; perhaps we don't even need to know as long as we know
that we want it and are ready to pay the price to purchase it. [We
globally consume security as we are being consumed by it]{.underline}.65

[Drawing boundaries is the inaugural gesture of the law, while policing
boundaries is its routine function]{.underline}. [The genesis of law
signals that \"\[t\]he primordial scene of the nomos opens with a
drawing of a line in the soil \... to mark the space of one\'s
own]{.underline}.\"28 [Modem law\'s insistent claims of its universality
notwithstanding, lines of demarcation that separate legality from
illegality often create zones where bodies and spaces are placed on the
other side of universality, a \"moral and legal no man \'s land, where
universality finds its spatial limit]{.underline}.\" 29 [Material and
discursive orders that enjoy hegemony in any setting, fashion and enable
instruments to draw these lines and carve out such zones]{.underline}.
The story of the Durand Line testifies to this phenomenon.

[The Durand Line was drawn by a colonial power in the nineteenth
century, which was a defining phase in the consolidation of modem
regimes of knowledge, along with the suturing of epistemology with the
state]{.underline}.30 [Therefore, it is critical to identify the
conceptual ensemble that furnished the scaffolding for such a
venture]{.underline}. It is the Author\'s position that [the conceptual
and discursive apparatus of international law, modem geography,
geopolitics, and borders are interwoven in the enabling frame that made
the drawing of this conflict-ridden dividing line possible]{.underline}.

A. International Law and Differentiated Sovereignty

[No sooner was a new world \"discovered,\" than a line, patition del mar
oceano, was drawn]{.underline} by the Treaty of Tordesillas on June 7,
1494.\" This line divided the world beyond Europe between Portugal and
Spain, and supplemented Pope Alexander VI\'s edict Inter caetera divinae
of May 4, 1494, with an agreement between sovereigns. 32 The right of
two royal houses of Europe over the division of the non-European world
as \"lords with full, free, and every kind of power, authority and
jurisdiction\"33 now stood grounded both in divine sanction and
sovereign will and consent.34 [This inaugural act of the incipient
global order injected colonialism into the genetic code of modem
international law]{.underline}.35 The \"amity lines,\" initiated by a
secret clause of the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis of 1559,
institutionalized a differentiation between the European \"sphere of
peace and the law of nations from an overseas sphere in which there was
neither peace nor law.\" 36 [These \"amity lines,\" which mandated
peaceful cooperation in the region within their bounds and gave license
to unbridled conflict without, gave rise to the maxim: \"Beyond the
equator there are no sins]{.underline}.\"37 [In the new global order,
\"\[e\]verything that occurred \'beyond the line\' remained outside the
legal, moral, and political values recognized on this side of the
line]{.underline}.\"38 [In this zone, \"beyond the line\" and \"beyond
the equator,\" doctrines of \"discovery,\" \"terra nullius,\" and
\"anima nullius\" flourished]{.underline}.39 [The career of modem
international law is the story of making, maintaining, and managing this
enduring line]{.underline}.

In the nineteenth century, [colonialism animated a decisive turn in the
evolution of modem international law, even though \"international law
consistently attempts to obscure its colonial origins, \[and\] its
connections with the inequalities and exploitation inherent in the
colonial encounter]{.underline}.\" 40 [The unquestioned universality of
international law \"was principally a consequence of the imperial
expansion]{.underline}."41 [The development of modem conceptions of
sovereignty and the international subject, which are bedrock constructs
of modem international law, has little to do with the professed
foundational concern of international law, i.e., stability of the
relations between sovereign states]{.underline}.42 Rather, [these
constructs were fashioned to manage the colonial relations of domination
and racial difference]{.underline}. 43

[Expansion of colonialism triggered a search for a legal framework that
could legitimize the securing of a range of rights and privileges from
colonized and dominated polities]{.underline}. Recognition of some
measure of sovereignty of the dominated polities was warranted by the
need to ensure that the terms of colonial treaties would be honored,
even though the terms of these treaties betrayed a lack of sovereignty
and equality.44 [This tension raised anew the question of what entities
were eligible to be regarded as proper subjects of international
law]{.underline}. 45 [In response, international law jettisoned
classical natural law constructs of sovereign equality]{.underline}, now
considered \"pseudo-metaphysical notions of what the essential qualities
of Statehood ought to be,\"46 [and turned to positivism based on actual
practice of states]{.underline}. Frames of jus gentium, or principles of
law common to all peoples, yielded to positivist ontology of law and
sovereignty. 47 This sharp turn yielded quick results. By the
mid-nineteenth century, [a new construct of differential sovereignty was
entrenched in international law-sovereigns and international subjects
were not alike in terms of rights, eligibilities, and
competencies]{.underline}. Sovereignty was now to be seen as a
differentially distributed bundle of rights.48 [Several classes of
sovereign states were constituted-some fully sovereign, others partly
so; some part of the \"family of nations,\" some outside it; some
entitled to domination, others with minimal legal
competence.]{.underline} 49 [A sliding-scale of \"layers of
sovereignty]{.underline}\"50 [emerged, stretching from \"Great Powers\"
to colonies, with suzerains, protected states, and protectorates
positioned in be- tween]{.underline}.51 Given that \"the founding
conception of late nineteenth-century international law was not
sovereignty but a collective (European) conscience," 52 [it is no
surprise that this sliding scale of sovereignty mirrored the Eurocentric
scale of \"civilization\" attendant to colonialism]{.underline}.53
\"\[[P\]ositivism\'s triumphant suppression of the non-European
world]{.underline}\"54 [rested on the premise that \"of uncivilized
natives international law t\[ook\] no account]{.underline}.\"55 No
wonder then that \"\[t\]o characterize any conduct whatever towards a
barbarous people as a violation of the laws of nations, only shows that
he who so speaks has never considered the subject.\" 56 [This muscular
and positive international law at the service of states \"with good
breeding]{.underline}\"57 [categorized a confluence of people and
territory as \"backward\" and legitimated colonial acquisition of
\"backward territory.\"]{.underline} 58 Note that [in yet another
deployment of the enduring civilized/ uncivilized binary, the
constituent statute of the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\")
mandates that judges be selected with due regard to \"the main forms of
civilizations . . . of the world,\" and the Court is required to apply
\"the general principles of law recognized by civilized
nations]{.underline}.\" 59 The ICJ has lived up to this mandate by, for
example, reaching out to \"geographical Hegelianism\" to resolve
territorial disputes in Africa.60

[While imperatives of colonialism shaped positivist doctrines of modern
international law, by the late nineteenth century they also ushered in a
new global order where mutual rivalries among colonial powers gave way
when concerted action in the service of maintaining colonial domination
was warranted]{.underline}. The first concrete step in this direction
was containment of the \"scramble for Africa\" at the Berlin Conference
on the Congo (1884-85), which aimed \"to bring the natives of Africa
within the pale of civilization by opening up the interior of the
continent to commerce.\" 61 This Conference, from which Africans were
completely excluded, institutionalized the \"right\" of \"Great Powers\"
to colonial dominion. 62 It was determined that when faced with
assertions of sovereignty over colonized territories, \"it is only the
recognition of such sovereignty by the members of the international
society which concerns us, \[of\] that of uncivilised natives
international law takes no account.\" 63 The logic of nineteenth century
international law could not have had it any other way:

[International law has to treat such natives as
uncivilised]{.underline}. It regulates, for the mutual benefit of the
civilised states, the claims which they make to sovereignty over the
region and leaves the treatment of the natives to the conscience of the
state to which sovereignty is awarded. 64

Consider that the Berlin Conference took place in the midst of Europe\'s
agrarian crisis and the Great Depression of 1873-86, which had \"shaken
confidence in economic self-healing\" and gave colonial expansion
further impetus. This was also the time when a \"specter of
\'overcivilization\' was breeding \"militarism\" and a longing for
\"imperial adventure\" in the U.S. 66 [With the Great Powers\' right to
colonize now secure, collective military interventions to protect
colonial orders were the next step in this progression]{.underline}. The
coordinated military action in China by Western powers to put down the
Boxer Uprising of 1900 was \"the dramatic beginning of the contemporary
phase of international history.\" 67 It was also in 1885, the year of
the Berlin Conference, that British foreign policy and intelligence
officials first developed blueprints for a \"pan- Islamic alliance
\[between\] Egypt, Turkey, Persia, and Afghanistan against czarist
Russia.\"68 This sowed a poison seed, the bitter fruits of which sour
many a palate today. The Durand Line was drawn in this milieu.

[This global framework animated instrumental deployment of the law to
reorder colonized spaces and bodies]{.underline}.69 [Law in the colony
aimed to \"re- duce them to civility,\" those who had \"no skill of
submission]{.underline}.\"70 [Violence was deemed a vital instrument of
colonial progress]{.underline},71 [with law furnishing \"the cutting
edge of colonialism]{.underline}.\"72 [Violence, in general, and the
violence of law, in particular, played \"the leading part in the
creation of civilization]{.underline}.\"73 [Colonial rule deemed
\"\[o\]ur law . .. a compulsory gospel which admits of no dissent and no
disobedience]{.underline}.\" 74 [This overt concert of law and violence
has been aptly characterized \"lawfare\[:\] the effort to conquer and
control indigenous peoples by the coercive use of legal
means.\"]{.underline}75 [The geo-legal space of colonialism brings into
sharp relief \"the blood that has dried on the codes of
law]{.underline}.\"76

[In the colony, law congealed epistemic, structural, and physical
violence. The colonized other, deemed an error of arrested evolution,
was prescribed corrective norms of a higher rational order. This \"soul
making]{.underline}\" 77 [colonial project entailed entrenchment of a
layered legal order. First, the colony was inserted into the global
legal system of hierarchically differentiated
sovereignties]{.underline}.78 [Second, metropolitan law was transplanted
in the colony supplemented by exceptions that ensured that coercion
displaced hegemony as its animating force, thereby ordering a \"rule of
difference\" that mandated performance of nonidentity between the
colonizer and the colonized]{.underline}.80 [Third, through selective
recognition, malleable norms of the colonized were truncated and
reconstituted as fixed \"customary law]{.underline}.\"81 In the career
of the Durand Line all these legal machinations of the colonial project
came into play

#### The plan's end to Japanese freeriding follows the narrative of transcendent humanity where the defeated nation rises from the ashes of war to an agent of global peacebuilding. This is only contributes to a global matrix of violence and racism that mobilizes knowledge for the preemption of all otherness

Program in Literature, "Entanglements, or Transmedial Thinking about
Capture", Chapter 6, 'American Studies in Japan, Japan in American
Studies: Challenges of the Heterolingual Address' pgs. 137-150)

On a previous visit to Japan, in the summer of 2005, when I spoke at an
international conference on Japanese cinema, I discussed Akira
Kurosawa's No Regrets for Our Youth (1946), a film based on the
controversy of the dismissal, in 1933, of a Kyoto University law
professor, Takigawa Yukitoki, on grounds of his pro-communist views by
the Education Minister Hatoyama. Kurosawa's film interested me because
its narrative structure provides a discursive opening for rethinking
political issues such as fascism, imperialism, and militarism with a
transnational awareness. Kurosawa achieved this by a noticeable
transition in the story, whereby the main female character, Yukie,
undergoes a personal transformation from being a Westernized, bourgeois
university student to being a sympathizer with the peasants' and women's
movements in Japan's postwar countryside.6 Despite what seems to be its
realism, the narrative transition in No Regrets for Our Youth is, I
argued, Kurosawa's means of articulating Japan to America in ways that
would become increasingly acute in the postwar world. [Although, because
of censorship during the Occupation led by the U.S. (1945-- 52), there
are no explicit representations of the Second World War in the
diegesis]{.underline} (except for the announcement, in 1941, of Japan's
attack on Pearl Harbor and then eventually of Japan's loss of the war),
[this narrative mechanism bridges the world]{.underline} of the 1930s
and 1940s, [in which Japan was dominated by the furor over war (both in
the form of pro-war and antiwar sentiments), and the postwar world that
apparently embraces the "peace-loving" ways of Japanese agrarian
life]{.underline}. In her function as the narrative hinge, Yukie
objectifies this transition by turning herself into a dutiful widow and
daughter-in-law, a hardworking peasant woman who is determined to
vindicate her husband's (misunderstood) patriotism in the eyes of the
community. Yukie's feminine hands and fingers, which once produced the
tunes of Western music on the piano, are now shown to labor steadily in
the soil, cultivating rice for the village. [In this simple temporal
movement--- what appears to be a series of successive chronological
happenings in a moral fable--- emerges a stark sense of what I would
call epistemic uncertainty]{.underline}. If narrative transition is not
a natural order of things but an event in itself, I asked, what are we
to make of the shift between the early and final parts of the story? As
mentioned, [the early part of the story takes place in contemporary,
urban Japan in what might be called a progressive time]{.underline} (the
1930s): [all the trappings of Westernization, including the activist,
antifascist sentiments, are there, propelling Japan toward a future in
which it can become not only a mimic of but also an equal to the
West]{.underline}. The later part of the story (first near the end of
the war and then after it, in the mid-1940s), by contrast, returns us to
a rural environment in which the most important activity is the
cultivation of rice. [Rather than the progressive time already
encountered in the earlier part, we find here a time that seems
backwardand inward-looking, as though **the process of national
soulsearching in the aftermath of political and military defeat must
involve a (re)turn,** literally, **to roots** and working through those
roots by hand]{.underline}. (At one point Yukie says, "I have found my
roots in that village.") [The politics of temporality set up in the
narrative transition thus evokes the classic opposition between
Westernized modernity and non-Western native tradition, with the paradox
that the seemingly backward and inward, spiritual (re)turn to Japan's
roots is at the same time shown as a forward advancement (including a
proto-feminist awareness of women's liberation). That is to say, the
rehabilitation of tradition is now given to us, the audience, as the
viable way of moving on to the future.]{.underline} Is the later part of
the story really a logical follow-up to the earlier one, then? Who
exactly is making this claim, and to whom is it directed? If the film is
taken as a kind of heterolingual address in Sakai's terms, the
perspectives being implicitly or explicitly invoked are mind-boggling.
Was Kurosawa primarily addressing the national Japanese audience, who,
to all appearances, belonged to the same community as he? Was he at the
same time calling forth--- constructing through the medium of film---
another kind of community, one that is not uniformly or necessarily
predisposed to hearing the same message? When the film is interpreted as
a heterolingual, rather than simply monolingual (or mononational and
monocultural), address, [**its fantastical narrative transition,** with
its puzzling juxtaposition of the two apparently incommensurable parts,
**the "before" and "after**," merits interrogation. If the
stigmatization and ostracization]{.underline} faced by Yukie's husband's
(Noge's) family is an allegory of the stigmatization and ostracization
[**faced by Japan** in the community of nations **at the end of the
war,** it is **through unconditional** submission and **dedication to
the** goal of **renewed, collective self-fashioning**---exactly the kind
of aggressive affect that bolstered both Japan's militarism and the
violence of its antimilitarist activism before and during the
war]{.underline}--- that Noge's family, led by Yukie, now tries to
extricate itself from its predicament. [Albeit **a peaceful
corrective**, the return to the soil seems in tune with patterns of
obsessive mental and physical behavior that were **inscribed in Japan's
wartime catastrophe** in the first place. In both cases, it **is about**
persisting in **(re)gaining footing in and recognition by a hostile
world, with** a stubborn **investment in Japan's exceptionalism**, as is
typically justified in what came to be known as Nihonjinron (the
discourse on the Japanese).]{.underline} [Viewed **as** an attempt at
**heterolingual address, directed** not only **at a uniform** or
predictable **Japanese audience but also** at **a postwar international
public occupied** in multiple senses **by the U**nited **S**tates, the
narrative transition that happens]{.underline} between the first and
second part of this "Japanese" movie may therefore be grasped [as the
enunciation of a certain redefined geotemporal politics in relation to
America. Made very soon after the war, the film hails the audience as
members of a new global configuration--- a kind of "us"---dominated by
America and its own version of expansionism and Orientalism in the
Pacific]{.underline}. Ironically, too, this was the period in which the
official, U.S.-led Occupation forbade the representation of Occupation
forces in Japanese films: "The American censors tried not only to
suppress criticism of it \[the Occupation\], but also to hide the very
fact that Japan was being occupied at all and that foreign officials
were closely supervising the Japanese media."7 [This active prohibition
of reference to a political and military presence meant
that]{.underline} (for a filmmaker such as Kurosawa) [the historicity of
Japan's so-called second chance of the postwar years had to be dealt
with by indirect means. To this extent, the strikingly incongruent
temporalities]{.underline} of Kurosawa's film narrative [can be
read]{.underline}--- irrespective of Kurosawa's personal convictions and
intentions--- [as a kind of response to this prohibition, a response
that takes the form of a silent decoding of the destinies scripted for
the Pacific in its postwar transactions with the United States and the
rest of the capitalist Western world. First among these postwar
transactions (between Japan and the West) is the inducement of
discipline that takes the form of a rationalistic submission and
dedication to the work ethic. **From the ashes of the war, Japan was to
rise to the status of a global economic power through** quantifiable
**capitalist productivity** (in the form of industry and manufacture).
This phenomenon of a hyperproductionism, encouraged and supported by the
United States in its attempt to arrest the spread of communism in East
Asia, was to replicate itself in the emergence of the so-called Asian
Tigers (Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong]{.underline}) in
the 1970s and 1980s, and finally, since the 1990s, [in the rise in world
status of an ideologically capitulating and complicit People's Republic
of China.]{.underline} Second, even though [this magical
capacity]{.underline} for work [is an indispensable ingredient in the
postindustrial capitalist vision of economic growth]{.underline}, in No
Regrets for Our Youth it is enigmatically [associated with another kind
of time: the time of the peasant, of agriculture, and of country life.
As has become clear in the case of contemporary China, the demands and
rewards of capitalism always mean the uprooting of countryside
populations and massive migrations to urban areas where work
opportunities are more abundant. To valorize the work ethic]{.underline}
through an affirmation of a return to the soil is thus, as Kurosawa's
narrative suggests, [to place Japan in an impossible bind: if Japan and
the rest of Asia are given recognition as participants in the global
present through dedication to work, such dedication is granted
intelligibility only as the attribute of a nonpresent time (that is, the
attribute of a continuous tradition, an essential
Asian-ness)]{.underline}.8 The schematization of the story into two
kinds of temporalities, a mere technicality of the plot for some
audiences, turns in this manner into a heterolingual and heterocultural
manner of addressing--- both in the sense of speaking about and in the
sense of speaking to--- America. [To the postwar international public,
the address enunciates America, as Spanos suggests]{.underline} in his
essay on American studies, [as a kind of thinking or language (rather
than as a bounded object) whose effects are felt in the form of an
ontological rupture--- the enigmatic splitting of Japanese society
between the two temporalities just described. Enigmatic because it
is]{.underline}, within the film diegesis, [unclear from where such a
splitting could arise]{.underline}: What causes the rupture in the first
place? Can the problems of modernity and urbanization be resolved by a
return to agriculture and country life? [Can Japan abandon its fascism
and militarism and simply start over again]{.underline} by growing rice?
In retrospect, [what is being foregrounded in the narrative transition
is the problematic nature of an imaginary effort at cultural
recommencement, or cultural reorigination, under the American-centric
circumstances after the war]{.underline}. Considered in this manner, the
supposedly forwardbut slightly awkward-looking image of Yukie on her
final return to the village (as she climbs onto the truck with the help
of other villagers) gives us a good clue to Kurosawa's conception of the
problems at hand. As the leader of the democratic culture movement--- a
symbol of hopefulness, willpower, and emancipation--- Yukie seems rather
out of sync with the villagers, who represent the future yet who are
also quite capable of being stuck in bigotry and malice. It is in this
complex series of significations, shuttling throughout the film among
personal, communal, national, and international levels of intensity, and
superimposed on one another to produce Yukie's face itself as a
time-image, that we should come to terms with Kurosawa's statement "This
woman I wanted to show as the new Japan."9 To sum up, my point about No
Regrets for My Youth is that it may be considered a cinematically
mediated heterolingual address, in which [the epistemic contradictions
and incommensurabilities of imagining Japan's contemporaneity in the
postwar world]{.underline} in terms of its rice-growing ritual, its
return to a pure, rustic Japaneseness, [are]{.underline} plainly
acknowledged and [staged rather than being suppressed. How would we
respond as the recipients of or interlocutors with such an address,
especially from the point of view of American studies?]{.underline} In
the second to last film he made in his career, Rhapsody in August
(1991), Kurosawa dramatizes the problematic of the Japan-U.S.
relationship through another, much older female character, Kane, a
grandmother of four teenagers who are spending their summer vacation in
her farmhouse outside Nagasaki, while their parents (Kane's son, Tadao,
and daughter, Yoshie) are in Hawaii visiting an elder brother of Kane's,
Suzujiro Haruno, who had emigrated to the United States in 1920. The old
woman, we soon learn, is a widow whose husband, a schoolteacher, was
among the civilians killed in Nagasaki on 9 August 1945, when the United
States dropped the second atomic bomb on Japan. While enjoying their
time together with Granny (even though they do not like her cooking) and
recalling what happened in Nagasaki at the end of the war, the young
people receive a letter from their parents with pictures of their
relatives on the other side of the Pacific. Suzujiro, who married a
white American woman who is now deceased, is quite ill, and his son,
Clark, is managing the family's sizable pineapple business. From the
pictures, it is clear that Kane's extended family live the enviable life
of the well-to-do in America. Tadao, Yoshie, and Clark all urge Kane to
go to Hawaii and see her dying brother. In an attempt to persuade their
mother, Tadao and Yoshie fly back to Japan, only to find on their
arrival that Kane has, with the help of the grandchildren, already sent
off a telegram to the Hawaii relatives, indicating her willingness to
visit after she has attended the annual memorial service for her
husband. Anxious that this embarrassing mention of the past might upset
the Hawaii relatives and thus spoil their own business prospects in the
United States, Tadao and Yoshie become rather agitated, especially when
they hear that Clark, on receiving Kane's telegram, has decided to come
for a visit himself. The rest of the film shows the three generations of
the family playing host to Clark after he arrives, fussing over making
him comfortable, answering his questions about the family and their
grandfather (his uncle), and taking him to visit various sites,
including the elementary school playground in Nagasaki where
schoolchildren were killed by the atomic blast, the commemoration
ceremony in the village honoring Grandfather and other victims, and the
pond by the waterfall where the children like to spend their time
playing (and where Clark receives the news that his father has just
died). We also see Clark having a conversation with Kane in which he
apologizes for not knowing what had happened to her in the past and she
repeatedly responds, "It's all right." After Clark's departure, Tadao
and Yoshie are about to take off again, only to notice that something
seems to have overtaken Kane's mind, causing her to act as though she
were back in 1945. She mistakes Tadao for her elder brother and, at the
light and sound of a thunderstorm, hastens to cover the sleeping
children's bodies with white sheets so as to shield them from the glare
of what she thinks is the atomic blast. The next morning, a neighbor
comes with the news that Kane, probably seeing how that day's cloud
patterns resemble the cloud patterns on 9 August 1945, has headed off
for Nagasaki to look for her husband. The last series of scenes shows
the family members running in the storm to try to catch up with her. The
scene finally ends with Kane forging ahead, her umbrella turned inside
out, while the noise of the wind and rain gives way to a children's
choir singing the song "Heidenröselein" (Franz Schubert's setting of
Goethe's early nineteenth-century poem of the same name, translated as
"The Heathrose"), the tune that one of Kane's grandchildren has been
trying to play on her old pedal organ since the beginning of the film.
In contrast to the enigmatic temporal transition in No Regrets for Our
Youth, the engagement with the Second World War and with America in
Rhapsody in August takes the form of memory. Although, as in the earlier
film, narrative is the key to our grasp of the mise-en-scène, it is less
a matter of a progression of external events than a recollection of
catastrophic happenings, a recollection that materializes somewhat
sporadically, in the children's conversations among themselves and with
Kane over the course of several weeks. And even as we become aware of
the burden of history that Kane has been bearing for forty-some years,
Kurosawa offers no newsreel footage or direct voice-over journalistic
accounts of that history. The conspicuous absence of such documentary
evidence of the original event (reminding us of the absence of any
images of the war or any direct reference to the Occupation period in No
Regrets for Our Youth) renders the act of recollection all the more
evocative, as the audience is left to imagine what it was like and what
it must have been like. As we visit, first with the children and then
with Clark, a scene of the crime--- the playground in the elementary
school in Nagasaki where Kane's husband was presumably killed together
with the schoolchildren, and where the monument of a twisted jungle gym
stands as the only visible index to the tragedy of the destruction---
the present becomes foregrounded as the time in which both the
characters and the audience must come to terms with what is remembered.
Such foregrounding of the present raises the stakes for the
heterolingual address to an acute level. [Following the narrative that
results from memory and recollection, **the audience must negotiate its
reactions to** myriad imbrications: **Japan as a victim of** the atomic
bombs and of **America's** ultimate acts of **aggression; Japan's** own
**record of imperialism** and its countless victims in the rest of Asia;
Japan's self-reconstruction as a pacifist nation since the end of the
war; reactionary Japanese politicians' denial to this day of Japan's war
crimes; and the history of Japanese Americans in the United
States]{.underline}. By withholding the customary imagistic and
narrational reminders, and by focusing our attention on the time of now,
Kurosawa has, I believe, once again opened up a space, one that is, like
that in No Regrets for Our Youth, epistemic in import. Whereas in the
earlier film [the staging of epistemic rupture serves to foreshadow
Japan's postwar existence in a global situation dominated by
America]{.underline}, in Rhapsody in August what is of interest [is less
the anticipation of geotemporal politics than the portentous yet mundane
question of authority and agency in the aftermath of an unimaginable
disaster. How are people supposed to behave when their loved ones are
seized from them by war? Faced with the aggressor, in this case America,
how are an atomic bomb widow and her descendents supposed to
survive?]{.underline} Tadao and Yoshie offer one kind of answer: [for
them it is better simply to be silent about the past because the former
aggressors, citizens of a superpower, must be treated with kid gloves;
having cordial relations with them is of vital importance to Japanese
self-interest]{.underline}. Kane herself, on the contrary, insists that
there is nothing wrong with speaking about the past because there is
nothing wrong with speaking truthfully; in that insistence, which seems
to be shared (though perhaps not entirely comprehendingly) by Kane's
grandchildren, we find a refreshing alternative to the unctuous and
obsequious attitudes personified by her son and daughter. Even so,
Kane's memory is thrust into a new dimension of complexity by the
arrival of Clark. The pain she has been enduring for forty-some years is
now unexpectedly brought into sharp focus and subjected to the gaze of
an outsider who is, moreover, not just an American but also a blood
relative. Clark is, strictly speaking, a cultural as well as biological
hybrid, and his status as half-Japanese and half-American can perhaps be
read as an allegory of the inextricably entwined fates of Japan and
America in the postwar era. (Entirely left out of Kurosawa's and the
Japanese characters' purviews is the ugly history of the U.S.
government's internment of Japanese American citizens during the war.)
Be this as it may, Clark's visit to the Japanese village and its
inhabitants is nothing short of a dramatic entrance, the kind of
fictional design that is aimed at or has the potential of bringing about
something significant. What exactly is it? If Clark is a stand-in for
"ethnic America," what does his brief appearance accomplish? Clark's
sojourn makes it impossible not to think of Rhapsody in August as a film
about mourning. It is as though Kane's memory, which has hitherto been
somewhat blurry (as she at first seems to have forgotten, or so she
claims, even about her elder brother in Hawaii), is now--- if I may use
a term from film technology--- remastered with Clark's entry. As her
personal loss and suffering acquire the effects of a restored and
enhanced film, which has reemerged in its full sensorial immediacy from
the fog of old age and antiquated domestic existence, the act of
recollection takes on the significance of an inimitable cinematic
handling of the past. Yet even as the audience is, like her
grandchildren, drawn sympathetically into the mournfulness of Kane's
life story, the knowledge of Japan's imperial aggression against its
neighbors also looms. For a scholar of Chinese descent such as myself,
the compassion Kurosawa so clearly bestows on the victims of Nagasaki is
controverted by the film's silence on Japan's war crimes in China,
Korea, and southeast Asia.10 In this respect, is not the film ironically
a bit like Tadao and Yoshie, its most callous characters? What could be
the rationale for its muteness about the past? The ineluctability of
this kind of antagonistic, rather than comfortable or harmonious,
reaction among members of the film's audience is, I believe, exactly
what lies at the core of Sakai's proposal of the heterolingual address:
How to speak responsibly and nonexclusively to the element of the
genuinely foreign or alien in our midst? By extension, this question
would have to involve not only the demographics of the audience
(Japanese, American, Chinese, Korean, men, women, children, and so
forth) but also what may come across as politically objectionable or
inappropriate language, as for instance the language of a film. In the
case of a film about a survivor of the Nagasaki bombing, how are we to
deal with the existence and eruption of obviously irreconcilable
perspectives, such as those stemming from Japanese national chauvinism,
on the one hand, and, on the other, our knowledge of Japan's criminal
imperialist behavior during the Second World War? The ingenuity of
Kurosawa's handling of this impasse may be glimpsed in several sets of
speeches and exchanges within the diegesis. In an early scene, when the
grandchildren suspect that Kane will not want to go to Hawaii because of
the way her husband died, Kane clarifies that she does not particularly
"like or dislike America" because of what happened, and that rather,
"war is to blame." She reiterates this attitude toward war later, when
she hears Yoshie scolding her son for writing that awkward telegram to
the Hawaii relatives. Taking responsibility for the telegram, Kane
lashes out, "[They claim they dropped the flash to stop war. It's
already been forty-five years now. But the flash hasn't stopped war.
They're still killing people! But you know . . . war is to blame. People
do anything . . . just to win a war. Sooner or later, it will be the
ruin of all of us."]{.underline} Even in English translation, these
simple words are striking in the manner they move from the specific to
the general, through the semantic shifts introduced in the third-person
plural pronoun, "they."11 In its collective anonymity, "they" is
provocative in this context precisely because it is ambiguous--- and
ambivalent. While the word does refer straightforwardly, at first, to
Americans insofar as they were the ones who dropped the flash, the
perspective of Kane's speech steadily broadens to become a criticism of
anyone who supports fighting a war in order to be triumphant and
supremacist: "They're still killing people! . . . People do anything . .
. just to win a war." If the identifiable "they" returns us to a
nameable other--- Japan's national enemy who victimized innocent
Japanese (and other) citizens--- the anonymous "people" signals rather a
general denunciation of war itself, whoever the instigator might be. To
put it differently, if "they" remains (localized in or as) the United
States, Kane's statement can be interpreted as an anguished rejection of
the national enemy, an entity based on the clearly set boundary between
"us" and "them": since "they" killed "our" people, we must continue to
condemn them. Mourning the dead, in this instance, would amount to a
tribal ritual, one that insists on not forgiving or forgetting one's own
condi tion of being injured, and the attendant act of recollection would
serve the purpose of reinstating that boundary between us and them so as
to avenge those of our own who have been sacrificed. (The characters
Shylock and Shin-ae, as discussed in chapter 5, furnish good examples of
this type of mourning and avenging behavior.) Once the notion of "they"
is detached from a particular name to become simply "people," however,
Kane's statements take on a decidedly different kind of connotation: all
those who, like the Americans, provide justifications for the atomic
attack (that it would not only end the war but also end war) are
precisely those who will continue waging war and killing people
indefinitely. Instead of invoking a definitive boundary between us and
them as adversaries based on national, cultural, or other types of
identities, Kane's statements problematize war itself by pointing to the
hypocrisy and delusion of its perpetrators (those who always insist on
giving war yet another round of reasoning, yet another chance). Equally
remarkable is the exchange that occurs between Kane and Clark as they
sit outside her house under the moonlight. Contrary to Tadao and
Yoshie's fears, not only are Clark and his family not offended by the
reminder of what happened in Nagasaki, but his father also immediately
sent him on a visit so that he can do whatever he can to help his aunt.
As he sits face to face with Kane, this is what they say to each other:
Clark: I am terribly sorry for not knowing about Uncle. I'm really
sorry. Kane: That's all right. Clark: You were born and live in
Nagasaki. And still, we didn't realize it. That was wrong of us. We were
wrong. Kane: That's all right. In the same conversation, Kane says
"That's all right" a third time, followed by "This is just fine." She
then finishes by saying, in broken English, "Thank you very much,"
whereupon she reaches out to Clark and shakes hands with him. Once
again, Kurosawa has exploited these simple words to their full ambiguous
capacity. Is Clark sorry because he and his family had no idea of what
happened to Kane, or is he sorry for what the United States did to
Japan? Did he come as a member of the extended family to offer an
apology to his aunt, or did he come as a representative of the United
States, to offer an apology to the Japanese?12 Although I tend to agree
with the view that there is nothing in Clark's words to suggest that he
is delivering more than a personal apology to an elderly relative, the
historical relations between Japan and the United States make it
difficult to dismiss the loaded symbolic dimensions of his deliverance.
This scene is poignant not because of Clark's words but because of
Kane's response: "It's all right." Is she saying it's all right that the
relatives in Hawaii did not think of what happened to her husband
because they were preoccupied with their own affairs, or is she saying
it's all right despite all her suffering, because no one in particular,
not even an American citizen or a blood relative, can or should be held
accountable for the casualties of that perpetual injunction, our love
for war? In Kane's gracious words, the aggression of identitarian
politics, with neatly divided positions between aggressor and aggressed
on the basis of national boundaries, has quietly unfolded (as a paper
boat unfolds into the piece of paper which gives it its erstwhile shape,
to paraphrase Walter Benjamin) into a universal refusal of war. (To
borrow the words of Julia Kristeva, "Might not \[such\] universality be
. . . our own foreignness?").13 This process of unfolding through pure
linguistic ambiguity turns the ordinary speeches and exchanges in this
film into examples of profound heterolinguality, wherein the lifelong
sorrow of an elderly widow, speaking only Japanese and residing in the
countryside, transforms itself into a sophisticated pacifist,
cosmopolitan address. In this transformation, mourning becomes a
fore-giving and an embrace: even those who have inflicted irreparable
damage on one are offered release from their guilt. Perhaps this is the
reason the film ends the way it does, with all the characters running
after Kane in the torrential rain. In their intensity and harshness, the
elements strike like an invincible enemy, against whom human resistance
by means of a feeble umbrella seems laughable. Yet the film concludes
not with the rain stopping or with the characters finding shelter.
Instead, after showing various characters slipping and falling on their
run, the film concludes when Kane's umbrella has so completely collapsed
that it might as well be given up. As she persists by inching forward,
her body drenched and exposed in the midst of the downpour, her fragile
defense against nature's onslaught becoming utterly useless, the noise
of the wind and rain is replaced by children's voices singing these
lyrics of the Schubert song: And the boy a rose did see, a rose standing
in the field. Blooming in innocence, Awed by the color it did yield. A
never-ending fascination For the crimson color of the rose standing in
the field. 14 Is Kane not precisely the bright red rose standing in the
field (like the one seen by her little grandson and Clark outside the
place of the memorial service for the atomic bomb victims), whose life
force demonstrates that war-like defenses are things that cannot and
will not last?15 In his study of postwar world cinema, Gilles Deleuze
writes that Kurosawa is a director whose films are not so much about
arriving at meaningful actions in response to a given situation as about
discovering large metaphysical questions deeply hidden therein. Deleuze
also comments that in Kurosawa's stories, no flight tends to be
possible.16 The way Rhapsody in August ends is certainly not a flight in
the sense of an escape from the situation; at the same time, it
unsettles Deleuze's conclusion, I think, with something rhapsodic. **[In
the transcendence of war]{.underline}** as allegorized by Kane--- [war
not simply in the sense of reciprocal hostility between warring parties
but also in the sense of defensiveness, vengefulness, and
self-aggrandizement against others--- **we find an aesthetic
improvisation of** a type of **postcatastrophe authority and agency,
which comes across** much less **in the form of** action and assertion
than in the form of **letting go.** **In their** de-monumentalization of
(the debt of) memory and **makingpossible of forgiving**]{.underline},
Kane's [**(speech) acts** are no longer simply]{.underline} parts of a
stubborn old woman's [recollection of the past. Rather, they
**constitute and are enunciated**]{.underline} filmically
**[as]{.underline}** the potentiality of a [**heterolingual address, in
which we hear a different "we" emerging, hailing a form of coexistence**
that is yet to be **permitted by the human world.**]{.underline}

### Link -- Mexican Cartels

#### Discourse of the Mexican narco-state under siege by cartels instantiates waves of racialized colonialism by positioning Mexico as culturally inferior and in need of development -- these representations undergird violent neoliberal apparatuses which makes structural violence and Mexican instability inevitable

**Carlos '14** (Alfredo Carlos, PhD Candidate in Political Science at UC
Irvine, former Q. A. Shaw McKean, Jr. Fellow with the School of
Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers University, March 2014,
"Mexico "Under Siege": Drug Cartels or U.S. Imperialism?" *Latin
American Perspectives* Volume 41 Number 2)

According to major U.S. newspapers and policy makers, [Mexico is
currently waging a "war on drugs."]{.underline} Former U.S. Secretary of
State Hillary [Clinton]{.underline} (quoted in Dibble, 2010) [described
the situation as "starting to resemble an insurgency]{.underline}" and
compared it to Colombia's crisis some two decades earlier. [The Los
Angeles Times]{.underline} (February 19, 2009) sponsored a conference
with the University of San Diego's Trans-Border Institute at which it
[suggested that Mexico is "under siege" by drug cartels]{.underline}.
Regular updates on the drug war appear in U.S. newspapers. For instance,
on January 20, 2010, the Associated Press ran a story entitled "7 Bodies
Linked to Drug Cartels Found in Mexico"; on March 19, CNN had one
entitled "Drug Criminals Block Roads in Mexico"; and on June 23 the New
York Daily News announced, "Mexican Drug Violence Nears Bloodiest Month,
President Felipe Calderon Pleads for Country's Support." [A simple
Google News search will show that Mexican drugs, drug-related violence,
and antidrug efforts are front and center in Mexico and the United
States and have become the primary issue between the two countries.
Drug-related violence is not, however, Mexico's foremost problem, and
the reporting on it obscures the more serious and immediate economic and
social problems it faces]{.underline}. More important, [it masks their
origin in U.S. economic foreign policy while providing justification for
continued and future U.S. paternalism and domination]{.underline}. [The
media and the government in the United States have a long history of
constructing and perpetuating this type of discourse about Mexico. It is
linked to discourses surrounding the colonization of the Americas, the
white man's burden, the extermination of the native population, Manifest
Destiny, the Mexican-American War, racial segregation in the United
States, and prejudice against immigrants]{.underline}. While the current
discourse regarding Mexico is different in that Mexicans themselves are
concerned about what is going on, the way it is shaped and manipulated
by the media reflects the earlier ones. Gilbert Gonzalez (2004: 7)
suggests that the [current understandings and representations of Mexico
date back to the 1800s, when "U.S. capital interests sought to penetrate
Mexico." The original discourse was expressly linked to economic
processes, and the same is true of the current drug-related violence
story]{.underline}. In that regard [discourse can be and in this case is
extremely powerful]{.underline}. Meta-Narratives and Dominant Discourses
Michel [Foucault]{.underline} (1972--1977: 120) [argues that "discourse
serves to make possible a whole series of interventions, tactical and
positive interventions of surveillance, circulation, control and so
forth]{.underline}." [Discourses generate knowledge and "truth," giving
those who speak this "truth" social, cultural, and even political
power]{.underline}. [This power "produces; it produces reality; it
produces domains of objects and rituals of truth]{.underline}"
(Foucault, 1979: 194). For Foucault (1972--1977: 119), "[what makes
power hold good, what makes it accepted, is . . . that it traverses and
produces things, it induces pleasure, forms knowledge, produces
discourse]{.underline}." In essence, [power produces discourse that
justifies, legitimates, and increases it]{.underline}. Similarly, Edward
[Said]{.underline} (1994: 14), speaking in reference to literary
discourse, [says that literature as a cultural form is not just about
literature. It is not autonomous; rather, it is about history and
politics.]{.underline} He says that [literature supports, elaborates,
and consolidates the practices of empire. Television, newspapers,
magazines, journals, books, advertisements, and the Internet all help
construct stories, creating cultures of "us" that differentiate us from
"them"]{.underline} (Said, 1994: xiii). [They all elaborate and
consolidate the practices of empire in multiple overlapping discourses
from which a dominant discourse emerges]{.underline}. [Dominant
discourses are constructed and perpetuated for particular
reasons]{.underline}. As Kevin Dunn (2003: 6) points out,
[representations have very precise political consequences.]{.underline}
[They either legitimize or delegitimize power]{.underline}, depending on
what they are and about whom (Said, 1994: 16). [Said asserts that a
narrative emerges that separates what is nonwhite, non-Western, and
non-Judeo/Christian from the acceptable Western ethos as a justification
for imperialism and the resulting policies and practices and argues that
discourse is manipulated in the struggle for dominance]{.underline}
(36). [Discourses are advanced in the interest of exerting power over
others; they tell a story that provides a justification for
action]{.underline}. For Said, [there is always an intention or will to
use power and therefore to perpetuate some discourses at the expense of
others. It is this intentionality that makes them dangerous and
powerful]{.underline}. As Roxanne Doty (1996: 2) suggests, [through
repetition they become "regimes of truth and knowledge]{.underline}."
[They do not actually constitute truth but become accepted as such
through discursive practices, which put into circulation representations
that are taken as truth. Dominant discourses,
meta-narratives]{.underline} (master frames that are often unquestioned
\[see Klotz and Lynch, 2007\]), [and cultural representations are
important because they construct "realities" that are taken seriously
and acted upon]{.underline}. Cecelia Lynch (1999: 13) asserts that
"[dominant narratives do 'work' even when they lack sufficient empirical
evidence, to the degree that their conceptual foundations call upon or
validate norms that are deemed intersubjectively legitimate." They
establish unquestioned "truths" and thus provide justification for those
with power to act "accordingly." They allow the production of specific
relations of power. Powerful social actors are in a prime position to
construct and perpetuate discourses that legitimize the policies they
seek to establish. Narrative interpretations don't arise out of thin
air; they must be constantly articulated, promoted, legitimized,
reproduced, and changed by actual people]{.underline} (Lynch, 1999).
Social actors with this kind of power do this by what Doty (1996) calls
self-definition by the "other." Said (1994: 52) suggests that [the
formation of cultural identities can only be understood
contrapuntally---that an identity cannot exist without an array of
opposites]{.underline}. [Western]{.underline}1 [powers, including the
United States, have maintained hegemony by establishing the "other":
North vs. South, core vs. periphery, white vs. native, and civilized vs.
uncivilized are identities that have provided justifications for the
white man's civilizing mission and have created the myth of a benevolent
imperialism]{.underline} (Doty, 1996: 11; Said, 1994: 51). [The
historical construction of this "other"' identity produces current
events and policies]{.underline} (Dunn, 2003). [Through constant
repetition, a racialized identity of the non-American, barbaric "other"
is constructed, along with a U.S. identity considered civilized and
democratic despite its engagement in the oppression, exploitation, and
brutalization of that "other."]{.underline} Consequently, [dominant
discourses and meta-narratives provide a veil for "imperial encounters,"
turning them into missions of salvation rather than conquests or, in
Mexico's case, economic control]{.underline} (Doty, 1996). Dunn (2003:
174) suggests that [dominant discourses legitimize and authorize
specific political actions]{.underline}, particularly economic ones.
[Scholars, intellectuals, and academics also engage in the perpetuation
of discourses and participate in their construction. There is a large
body of scholarly literature that describes Latin America as a
"backward" region that "irrationally" resists
modernization]{.underline}. Seymour Martin Lipset (1986), drawing on Max
Weber and Talcott Parsons, portrays Latin America as having different,
"inherently" faulty and "detrimental" value systems that lack the
entrepreneurial ethic and are therefore antithetical to the systematic
accumulation of capital. A newer version of this theory is promoted by
Inglehart and Welzel (2005), who focus on countries that allow
"self-expression" and ones that do not. Howard Wiarda (1986) suggests
that the religious history of Latin America promotes a corporatist
tradition that is averse to democratic and liberal values, asentiment
more recently echoed by the political scientist Samuel Huntington
(1996). Along these same lines, Jacques Lambert (1986) argues that the
paternalistic latifundia (feudal-like) social structure of Latin America
provides no incentive for self-improvement or mobility. Ultimately, [the
discourse created by the modernization and development literature
focuses on the "backward" values of the "other" and becomes the West's
justification for the continued underdevelopment of the
region.]{.underline} These interpretations lead to partial, misleading,
and unsophisticated treatment of complex political and economic
dynamics, particularly in Latin America. [They ignore the long history
of colonization and imperialism]{.underline}. Several notable Latin
American intellectuals have countered with a critique of the development
literature through dependency theory and Marxist theories of
imperialism. Writing on underdevelopment, Andre Gunder Frank (1969)
focuses on exogenous factors affecting Latin American economic
development, among them the penetration of capital into the region and
the asymmetrical trading relationships that were created. Celso Furtado
(1986) expands this notion and writes about the international division
of labor and Latin America's weakened position as the producer of
primary raw materials for Europe and the United States. Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and Enzo Faletto (1979) suggest that the domestic
economic processes in Latin American states emerged from this
relationship of dependency. More notably Raul Fernandez and Jorge Ocampo
(1974) argue that the Marxist theory of [imperialism provides an
explanation for the persistence of "backwardness" and identifies the
basic contradictions in Latin America as between imperialism and the
Latin American nations]{.underline}. This Latin American scholarship,
with rich critiques of mainstream modernization theory, has been
dismissed, however, because it comes from non-mainstream academic and
professional circles. Doty (1996: 164) views scholarship as an inventory
in which [non-Western scholarship is excluded because it is not regarded
as legitimate]{.underline}. While dependency theory and Marxist theories
of imperialism were briefly allowed into the inventory in the late 1980s
and the 1990s, they quickly went out of fashion and are now excluded
from the canon, easily dismissed and ultimately illegitimate. Dale
Johnson (1981) suggests that these theories were rejected for their
determinism---the assumption that Latin American nations had no agency
in their own economic development. Others criticized them for assuming
that economic development in its neoliberal form was a positive goal and
still others for providing no prescriptions for change or alternatives
to modernization. Scholars critical of modernization theories, including
Theotônio dos Santos (1971) and Fernandez and Ocampo (1974), addressed
all of these critiques and argued that these theories were not in fact
deterministic but, rather, merely sought to highlight exogenous
historical processes, including the penetration of industrialized
capital, that had affected endogenous economic and political dynamics in
Latin America and led to the persistence of "backwardness." Yet
dependency theory and Marxist theories of imperialism and their
corresponding discourse remained marginalized, largely because the
scholarship itself is not from an industrialized society or from
scholars in the mainstream of their disciplines. [There is an
asymmetrical relationship between scholars from the North]{.underline}
(the United States) [and scholars from the South]{.underline} (Latin
America, Africa, et al.) [and even between white and
nonwhite]{.underline} (American Latino) [scholars]{.underline}. The
literature, while rich in analysis and highlighting critical issues, is
read by many Northern scholars from an impoverished, reductionist, and
simplistic perspective. Discursive authorship is thus not equal, and
clearly [Western representations exert hegemony by constructing
discourses, representations, and narratives from underdeveloped regions
as illegitimate]{.underline} (Dunn, 2003). [It is important, then, to
understand and deconstruct discourses, unmasking their political and
economic motivations and consequences. The goal]{.underline}, as Lynch
(1999) points out, [is to expose the material and ideological power
relationships that underlie them---in the current case, U.S.
imperialism---and to examine counterhegemonic alternatives.]{.underline}
The U.S. Discourse on Mexico [The original U.S. discourse on Mexico
dates back to the 1800s, when Mexicans were depicted as an "uncivilized
species---dirty, unkempt, immoral, diseased, lazy, unambitious and
despised for being peons]{.underline}" (Gonzalez, 2004: 8). [This
discourse set the stage for the creation of]{.underline} what Gonzalez
calls [a "culture of empire," in which the United States made a
concerted effort to dominate Mexico economically and subordinate it to
U.S. corporate interests]{.underline} (2004: 6). [This narrative
depicted the country as a huge social problem and its people as inferior
to Americans, and it continues to dominate U.S. understandings of
Mexico]{.underline}. Sometimes this is done with the help of Mexican
politicians themselves, as in President Felipe Calderón's extension of
the hegemonic discourse of the "war on drugs." [The problem with this
contemporary representation is that it oversimplifies the country's
complex political dynamics and obscures what is really going on. Mexico
is suffering much more from extreme economic inequality, caused in large
part by U.S. economic imperialism and capital extraction (the North
American Free Trade Agreement, the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank), than from drug-related violence]{.underline}. The great
migration that has occurred since 1994 has been the result of a
decimated economy. [While some people may leave Mexico out of fear of
violence, the vast majority of the millions of emigrants have left
because of the necessity to feed their families]{.underline}. [The
discourse about drug-related violence detracts from the recognition of
this fact.]{.underline} [Media coverage of drug-related violence and
other negative reporting about Mexico have steadily increased over the
past 10--15 years and skyrocketed in the recent past]{.underline}. The
Los Angeles Times, for example, has dedicated a web site to the series
"Mexico Under Siege: The Drug War at Our Doorstep." It has reported,
among other things, that President Calderón deployed 45,000 troops and
5,000 federal police to 18 states (Los Angeles Times, February 3, 2010)
and that there were 10,031 deaths from drug-related violence between
January 1, 2007, and June 5, 2009 (Los Angeles Times, June 13, 2012).
(One may question the reliability of these figures, given that on
February 3, 2010, the paper had reported 9,903 such deaths since January
2007 and that on August 18 of that year it had reported a total of
28,228.) As far back as 1997, M. Delal Baer (1997: 138), the director of
the Mexico Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
in Washington, DC, suggested that "[skewed coverage is just another
example of how the U.S. media, average Americans, and their
representatives in Congress increasingly subscribe to a tabloid view of
Mexico]{.underline}." He asserted that "[drug and corruption stories
have increased every year in the New York Times, Washington Post, and
Wall Street Journal]{.underline}, leaping from 338 in 1991, to 515 in
1996, and 538 during the first eight months of 1997 alone" (138). This
was 16 years ago; one can only imagine what the numbers are today as the
drug problem in Mexico is depicted more and more as a U.S. national
security problem. [The U.S. State Department sent out travel warnings in
2009, 2010, and 2011 to all U.S. universities regarding spring-break
travel to Mexico, cautioning them about the increase in crime and
spreading fear about Mexico]{.underline} (Gomez, 2010). [The same was
done with the outbreak of H1N1, originally referred to as the "swine
flu."]{.underline} Within days of the outbreak Mexico was under pressure
from the world community and especially the United States to close down
schools and heavily populated areas in order to avert the spread of the
flu. [The association of a disease named after swine with Mexico
reinforced the "dirty," "unkempt," and "uncivilized"
representations]{.underline} that Gonzalez discusses. Lost on the
majority of the U.S. media and, consequently, on average Americans,
however, was the fact that the outbreak originated in a town where the
Smithfield Corporation, an American company with massive hog-raising
operations known to improperly handle its waste, had a factory farm
(Morales, 2009). The CDCP (2010) reported that only around 11,000 people
died of the H1N1 virus between April through December of 2009, in
comparison with the average of 36,000 people dying in the United States
each year of the "regular" seasonal flu. If the H1N1 flu was such an
epidemic, why was no one reporting on the deaths from the regular
seasonal flu in the United States, which were clearly more numerous? A
large portion of the U.S. Department of State web page on Mexico is
dedicated to warning Americans about such crime, safety, security, and
health issues (U.S. Department of State, 2011). It currently advises
citizens to delay unnecessary travel to Mexico because of the drug war.
One may expect this type of warning from an agency concerned with its
citizens' welfare, but [it is disturbing when the negative narrative
becomes "common knowledge" and is included in government military
strategic reports]{.underline}. In 2008 the U.S. Department of Defense
published a report entitled The Joint Operation Environment offering
perspectives "on future trends, shocks, contexts, and implications for
future joint force commanders and other leaders and professionals in the
national security field." Part 3, Section C, of the report, entitled
"Weak and Failing States," describes the "usual suspects" in this
category---in Sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East, and
North Africa. Discussing the concept of "rapid collapse," it asserts
that while, "for the most part, weak and failing states represent
chronic, long-term problems that allow for management over sustained
periods, the collapse of a state usually comes as a surprise, has a
rapid onset, and poses acute problems." It goes on to suggest that "two
large and important states bear consideration for rapid and sudden
collapse: Pakistan and Mexico." The discussion of Mexico is as follows
(U.S. Department of Defense, 2008: 35): The Mexican possibility may seem
less likely, but the government, its politicians, police, and judicial
infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal
gangs and drug cartels. How that internal conflict turns out over the
next several years will have a major impact on the stability of the
Mexican state. Any descent by Mexico into chaos would demand an American
response based on the serious implications for homeland security alone.
Among the many things that make this statement problematic is its
simplification of Mexico's political dynamics. First, [it assumes that
politicians, the police, and the judiciary are separate from and
therefore adversaries of criminal gangs and drug cartels]{.underline}.
Jorge Chabat (2002), a Mexican expert on drug trafficking and national
security, challenges this assumption, arguing that [the drug cartels buy
off politicians and are imbedded in political structures and
institutions]{.underline}. While the Mexican state has sought to clean
up its politics and provide more transparency, historically the
political elite and government technocrats have used their positions of
power to increase their wealth, turning a blind eye to illicit
operations. The Department of Defense statement is noteworthy because it
goes on to lay the groundwork for potential military intervention in the
event that Mexico descends into chaos. [The problem here, of course, is
who gets to define "chaos]{.underline}." The Drug Enforcement
Administration is already preparing for such an event, maintaining a
presence in Mexico (see Toro, 1999). [Representing Mexico as a potential
"failing state" in the midst of violent anarchy provides the U.S.
justification for continued economic paternalism. The U.S. media and
government have become extremely effective in representing a strange and
threatening foreign culture for the American audience and thus
manufacturing consent as it is considered necessary for action in
Mexico, whether it be further neoliberal economic development or
military intervention]{.underline}. It is therefore not surprising to
see the rise in negative reporting parallel the time line of increased
U.S. capital penetration into Mexico in the mid-1990s. Deconstructing
the Dominant Discourse Since the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, [the United
States has historically operated as if it had the moral high ground in
the international community. It has contrasted its supposed traditional
commitment to human dignity, liberty, and self-determination with the
barbaric brutality of the "others]{.underline}" (Said, 1994). [This
American exceptionalism has been used to legitimate its domination over
other countries. The notion of "world responsibility" is the rationale
for its economic or military endeavors]{.underline}. Because of this, it
may be instructive to look at its track record on some of the issues for
which it criticizes other countries. Because the current negative
discourse about Mexico is constructed around crime, comparing crime
statistics in the two countries is helpful in deconstructing it. In 2010
[there were an estimated 23 million reported crimes of violence and/or
theft in the United States]{.underline}. Of these 1,246,248 were violent
crimes,2 403 per 100,000 people, and of these 14,748 were homicides
(U.S. Department of Justice, 2010a). A murder is committed every 31
minutes (Watt, 2008). According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 1.35 million high school students in 2009 were either
threatened or injured with a weapon on school property at least once,
while approximately 1.2 million acknowledged having carried a weapon on
school property (CDCP, 2009). In the 2007--2008 school year, a record 34
Chicago public school students were killed (IOSCC, 2008). The proportion
of prisoners to its population in the United States is at an all-time
high, with 1.6 million criminals behind bars, more than any other nation
in the world; 1 in every 31 adults is in some part of the criminal
justice system (U.S. Department of Justice, 2010b). This proportion of
prisoners to the total population is six times the world average (IOSCC,
2008). This snapshot does not include crimes committed or provoked by
U.S. military aggression abroad.3 However, these [statistics clearly do
not justify any assertion that the United States is a "failing state."
Yet such data and observations are used to perpetuate a discourse that
jumps to that conclusion about Mexico]{.underline}. In comparison,
Mexico's rate of homicides per 100,000 inhabitants as recently as 2007
was 8.1 and has only risen in response to a heavy government crack-down
in what Youngers and Rosin (2005) call the "cockroach effect." The most
recent data suggest that in 2011 the rate was 23.7, still middling and
actually low compared with those of other Latin American nations (see
Table 1). The United States, with a rate of 4.8, is barely better than
Uruguay and much worse than Canada, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany.
Compared with other industrialized countries, it lags behind, closer to
"chaos." While proportionally more people are victims of homicide in
Mexico than in the United States, [Mexico is far from being an extreme
outlier]{.underline}. It is safe to say that there are many countries in
Latin America that have similar if not much more serious problems of
crime and violence, while at the same time the [United States faces
similar issues within its own borders. Yet, Mexico is scrutinized much
more closely and is the only one viewed with concern as a possible
"failing state]{.underline}." Furthermore, [while more people are killed
in Mexico, more people kill themselves in the United
States]{.underline}. Are we to conclude, then, that people in the United
States are more self-destructive or psychotic? No one would argue that
U.S. society is disintegrating into chaos because a sizable number of
its citizens want to end their lives. Yet similar figures are used to
arrive at this very conclusion when regarding Mexico. Some argue that
Mexico is scrutinized because it borders the United States in a
post-9/11 world or because of corruption or the ineffectiveness of the
Mexican judicial system. And while these critiques have some merit, the
negative discourse that dominates is about the violence, not about
Mexican corruption or their ineffective institutions. If looked at
historically, [Mexico's violence problem has remained relatively
constant over the course of the past 25 years, while the negative
discourse has grown exponentially in this same time period]{.underline}.
The condescending discourse perpetuated in the United States makes it
seem as though Mexico were becoming uninhabitable, when in reality this
is far from the case. While many residents do have concerns about the
violence and it has in fact affected tourism, [there are still people in
Mexico going about their daily lives]{.underline}. There is a web site
called "The Truth about Mexico" that is dedicated to making this very
point. It was created by Americans who have moved to Mexico to live but
is now used by Mexicans as well to challenge the dominant discourse. One
story, entitled "Mexico Murder Rate Reality Check," suggests that,
according to the Mexican attorney general in 2009, "[the drug-related
violence has scared away tourists and prompted some commentators to warn
that Mexico risks collapse]{.underline} . . . but the country registered
about 11 homicides per 100,000 residents last year, down from 16 in
1997" (quoted in Brown, 2009). This was at the height of the negative
reporting and was still a decrease of 30 percent since 1997 at that
point in time. An article regarding the U.S. State Department's
spring-break advisory by Frank Koughan (2009), a former CBS News 60
Minutes producer who has been living in Queretaro since 2006, suggests
that "consumers of American media could easily get the impression that
Mexico is a blood-soaked killing field, when in fact the bulk of the
drug violence is happening near the border. (In fact, one way of putting
this would be that [Mexico is safe as long as you stay far, far away
from the US]{.underline}.)" While there may have been an increase in the
numbers since 2009, the dominant discourse at the time was at least as
horrific as today's, even though the statistics show that between 1997
and 2009 homicide rates had actually fallen and have since grown in
proportion to the expansion of the war on drugs. There has also been
strong public pressure and civic engagement regarding the violence. One
example is the Marcha por la Paz, a march led by the poet-journalist
Javier Sicilia seeking to draw attention to the government's
militaristic tactics for fighting narcotrafficking, which have only
increased and intensified the violence (Samano and Alonso, 2011). The
march in 2011 attracted tens of thousands of participants from 38 cities
in different states in Mexico and from 26 other countries. Yet, the
average television viewer in the United States never hears about events
like this or about the people who have been fighting to end the
violence. [Is there drug violence in Mexico? Yes, but this does not make
Mexico a "failing state."]{.underline} While people are victims of drug
violence in Mexico, in the United States they are also victims of drug,
gang, or random violence and more recently of mass shootings. [Both
countries experience senseless violence that stems from complex societal
and political dynamics that cannot be easily simplified]{.underline}. It
is essential that the dominant narrative be deconstructed in order to
see why such narratives are perpetuated to begin with, which in the case
of Mexico brings us back to continued economic domination. Implications
of the Dominant Discourse [The importance of the drug-related violence
story lies in its masking the nature of U.S. involvement in Mexico's
social and economic problems]{.underline}. [It perpetuates a
relationship of imperialism between the United States and Mexico that
manifests itself in NAFTA, International Monetary Fund and World Bank
lending policies, and direct intervention in Mexico's "sovereign"
internal politics disguised as economic development and military
assistance to help bring order to Mexico]{.underline}. Mexican
politicians have bought the story and have been willing collaborators
with economic development to "help" Mexico. Former President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari and his Institutional Revolutionary Party vigorously
pursued NAFTA as a mechanism for injecting foreign capital into Mexico's
ailing economy (Castañeda, 1993). Jaime Serra, a former secretary of
trade, and J. Enrique Espinoza, an economist formerly on the council of
economic advisers to the president of Mexico, have fervently proclaimed
NAFTA a resounding success (Serra and Espinoza, 2002a), pointing to
increased foreign direct investment as evidence. However, [free trade
has led only to the enrichment of a few monopolistic corporations in the
United States while the economic situation of Mexico's people
deteriorates]{.underline} (Robledo, 2006). Gilbert Gonzalez and Raul
Fernandez (2003: 54) argue that "[NAFTA is just one of the most recent
examples of U.S. domination over Mexico and how it continues to
misdevelop and tear apart the socioeconomic integrity of that
society]{.underline}." [They describe NAFTA as having two purposes: to
"guarantee a free hand to U.S. enterprises willing and able to invest in
Mexico to take advantage of that country's cheaper wages" and to "deny
in various forms and degrees to other economic powers the advantage of
operations in and exporting from Mexico]{.underline}." In effect [this
means continuing Mexico's long history as a U.S. economic colony,
providing cheap labor, raw materials, and manufactures for consumption
in the United States while restricting Mexico's access to the U.S.
market. NAFTA called for the privatization of state companies and the
flexibilization of the labor market through "restrictions on wage
increases, curtailment of vacations and sick-leave time, extensions of
workweek, and increased management powers]{.underline}" (Gonzalez and
Fernandez, 2003: 55). This process was supposed to lead to an opening
for investment, economic growth, and access to diversified export
markets for Mexico. [The impact of NAFTA on Mexican agriculture has been
greater because agricultural production was once the foundation of
Mexico's national development. State investment in agriculture was
reduced by 95.5 percent and credit made available to the rural sector by
64.4 percent]{.underline} (Quintana, 2004: 251). Disinvestment in
Mexican agriculture has meant that agricultural enterprises are unable
to compete with subsidized U.S. commodities. The United States maintains
domestic subsidies that allow it to export corn at 30 percent below the
cost of production, wheat at 40 percent below, and cotton at 57 percent
below---a practice known as "asymmetrical trading" and "dumping" and
deemed illegal in world commerce (Fernandez and Whitesell, 2008). Serra
and Espinoza (2002b) suggest that this is a nonissue because of NAFTA's
tariff-rate quota system, which charges tariffs for exceeding the import
quotas. However, Cavanaugh and Anderson (2002) point out that [under
NAFTA the tariffs were mandated to be phased out in 2008, and even while
they were intact the Mexican government declined to collect them. The
outcome has been the disappearance of profitability for Mexican national
agricultural producers. Five years after NAFTA, corn had lost 64 percent
of its value and beans lost 46 percent while at the same time prices of
staple consumer goods rose 257 percent]{.underline} (Quintana, 2004:
256). Despite these figures the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
(OUSTR, 2006) points to the growth of Mexican agricultural exports to
the United States by US\$5.6 billion during the past 12 years as proof
of the success of NAFTA. However, producers continue to abandon
agricultural endeavors en masse, vacating 1.6 million previously
cultivated hectares (3.95 million acres) in the first eight years of
NAFTA (Quintana, 2004: 256). Peter Goodman (2007) tells the story of
Ruben Rivera, who sat on a bench in a forlorn plaza, rather than working
on his seven-acre farm. He used to grow tomatoes and onions, hiring 150
workers to help at harvest. Now he doesn't even bother to plant. He can
buy onions in the supermarket more cheaply than he can grow them. A crop
of tomatoes yields less than the taxes. He lives off the \$800 sent home
monthly by his three sons, who run a yard work business in Macon, Ga.
Stories like this have become all too common. As Quintana (2004: 256)
puts it, "[One of the historically great agricultural civilizations of
the world \[now places\] its food supplies in foreign
hands]{.underline}." Mexico now imports 95 percent of its edible oils,
40 percent of its beef, pork, and other meat products, 30 percent of its
corn, and 50 percent of its rice. [NAFTA has resulted in the "complete
inability of the Mexican nation to produce the food required to feed its
own people]{.underline}" (Gonzalez and Fernandez, 2003: 57). In the end,
"[free trade" has made Mexico a completely open market for U.S. products
while U.S. producers are guarded against Mexico's products by subsidies
and tariffs. NAFTA was never meant as a development policy for Mexico or
a policy to help cure its social ills. It was a policy of U.S. economic
expansion for the purpose of deepening U.S. hegemony while allowing the
continued extraction of capital]{.underline}. It was promoted by huge
U.S. multinational corporations as benevolent economic development to
allow them to integrate themselves into the Mexican market without
having to deal with that country's requirements and legislative issues.
Mark Weisbrot (2004) of the Center of Economic Policy Research in
Washington suggests that, had Mexico's economy grown at the same pace
from 1980 to the present as it did in the period from 1960 to 1980,
today it would have the same standard of living as Spain. . . . To have
25 years of this rotten economic performance, you'd have to conclude
something is wrong. . . . It is hard to make the case that Mexico's
aggregate economic performance would have been even worse without NAFTA.
Not only has NAFTA not accomplished the growth propulsion its supporters
promised in Mexico but it has had devastating social costs for Mexican
society. [Poverty in rural areas has risen significantly from 37 percent
in 1992 to 52.4 percent in 2002, with 86.2 percent of rural inhabitants
living in poverty]{.underline} (Quintana, 2004: 257). [NAFTA has left
nearly half of Mexico's 106 million people, 51 percent of the total
population in 2010, living in poverty, causing the mass displacement of
workers and forced migration]{.underline} (Dickerson, 2006; World Bank,
2013). Since 1994 an average of 600 peasants a day (at least 1.78
million people) have migrated from rural areas, many to northern cities
along the U.S.-Mexican border and others into the United States
(Quintana, 2004: 258). Migration means family disintegration and the
destruction of the social fabric of Mexico. Many of these jobless
displaced workers will try their luck at crossing a militarized border
into the United States. Peter Goodman (2007), interviewing Luz Maria
Vazquez, a tomato picker from Jalisco, reports that six of her brothers
and sisters are in the United States, most of them without papers. More
than 11 million Mexicans (a conservative estimate) now live in the
United States without documents, and 7 million of them immigrated after
NAFTA, between 1994 and 2005 (Passel, 2006).4 Clearly the politics in
Mexico are much more complex than the drug story in the United States
makes them out to be. Conclusion The dominant discourse about Mexico in
the United States has a long history and has affected the way Mexicans,
Mexican-Americans, and Chicanos are viewed and treated. While much has
changed since the 1800s, the current discourse about Mexico serves the
same basic purpose. [The United States legitimizes its expansionist
economic foreign policy in terms of the burden of civilizing, uplifting,
and promoting development in less developed countries, beginning with
its neighbor to the south]{.underline} (Gonzalez, 2004: 185). [It
employs a foreign policy that advances its imperialist interests. U.S.
government and media agencies generate a representation of Mexico that
has provided avenues for very specific courses of action. Promoting a
discourse of a "chaotic," "unruly," "failing state" has provided
justification for direct U.S. military intervention, especially along
the border, now potentially with armed drones]{.underline} (O'Reilly,
2013), [and legitimized the penetration of U.S. capital interests in
Mexico at the expense of Mexico's own economy and, more important, its
people]{.underline}. Even at its most basic level, [we can only call
this imperialism]{.underline}. While Mexico has an ineffective justice
system, government corruption, and crime and drug-related violence,
these are problems that most modern nation-states also face. In fact,
the United States is itself heavily implicated in the drug trade,
holding by far the largest stocks of cocaine in the world and being
Mexico's primary market (INCB, 2008). It is also the largest supplier of
arms not just to Mexico but to all of Latin America (Chomsky, 2012).
Latin American countries are working together toward the
decriminalization of drugs, which has produced very promising results in
Portugal, while, in stark contrast, "the coercive procedures of the
40-year U.S. drug war have had virtually no effect . . . while creating
havoc through the continent" (Chomsky, 2012). But [the conversation
doesn't revolve around what the United States can do to clean up its own
act; it is about "othering" Mexico.]{.underline} The United States has
had a tremendous impact on Mexico's internal dynamics regarding
migration, unemployment, poverty, and crime. Its [economic imperialism
has contributed to the weakness of Mexico's economy and as a result its
internal politics. NAFTA has stunted Mexican economic growth and led to
the mass displacement of workers, forcing them into job markets that
they would not have considered had they had access to jobs with
dignity]{.underline}. For many it has led to migration to the United
States, while for others it has meant lives of crime and violence. But
no one discusses this, and it gets no media coverage because the focus
is not on the failed U.S.-imposed neoliberal economy but on drug-related
violence. This is done purposefully, since [the story does specific work
and is perpetuated because it benefits U.S. economic interests and works
as a mechanism of justification for continued U.S.
imperialism]{.underline}. For the most part, the concerns that the vast
majority of people experience the vast majority of the time on a daily
basis are not about these drug-violence outrages. Instead they are
economic---how they will pay their bills and clothe, shelter, and feed
their families. Even in the conversation about immigration reform, no
one discusses the fundamental right that people have to live and grow in
the place they consider home. No one discusses that people choose to
migrate only when they have no other options. U.S. imperialism has led
to people's having no other option. [Representing Mexico as a "failing
state" allows the United States to evade responsibility for creating
many of these problems in Mexico while also providing a powerful story
to convince American citizens and Mexican politicians that U.S. economic
intervention in Mexico is necessary]{.underline}. The irony of it all is
that [NAFTA continues to be justified through a narrative of a chaotic
and violent Mexico needing economic programs of development to solve its
social problems, when in fact it is the penetration of U.S. capital that
has caused many of those problems. The meta-narrative helps to
perpetuate an asymmetrical power relationship between Mexico and the
United States. The dominant discourse provides the veil for this
"imperial encounter" to become a mission of salvation rather than of
economic conquest]{.underline}. In the end, the way [Mexico is
represented in the United States has little to do with its actual
internal political or social dynamics, instead it is a means to expand
and maintain U.S. imperialism in Mexico.]{.underline} Over the past 150
years, one thing that has stayed the same is Mexico's position as an
economic colony of the United States, a place to go for cheap labor, raw
materials, and cheap manufactures for consumption at home. [Focusing on
drugs and violence obscures this]{.underline}. While Mexico does have
serious issues of drug-related crime, this crime is not the most severe
of Mexico's problems. Those problems are poverty and unemployment and
the country's inability, for the first time in its history, to feed its
own people. [Mexico is indeed "under siege"---not by drug lords but by
U.S. economic interests---and this has had disastrous social costs for
the Mexican people.]{.underline} This is not, however, the discourse we
engage in. That discourse is purposefully absent.

### Link -- Middle East Instability 

#### The 1AC representations of the Middle East are rooted in binary systems of exclusion which culminate in violence against the Other who occupies the devalued position in this system.

**Hirchi** **\'07** (Mohammed, \"Media Representations of the Middle
East,\" WACC. World Assoc. for Christian Communication. Online)

[This marking of difference is articulated within clear
boundaries]{.underline}; it does not tolerate ambiguous, unstable or
hybrid spaces of indeterminacy. According to Hall: 'Stable culture
requires things to stay in their appointed place. [Symbolic boundaries
keep the categories 'pure', giving cultures their unique meaning and
identity.]{.underline} What unsettles culture is "matter out of place"--
the breaking of our unwritten rules and codes' (1997: 236). [**This
process of purification legitimizes exclusion, intolerance and racism.
It also allocates marginal identities to individuals who do not conform
to the values of the West as a geographical and a cultural
space**.]{.underline} In this perspective, [symbolic representations are
necessary to maintain difference: 'Symbolic boundaries are central to
all culture. Marking "difference" leads us, symbolically, to close
ranks, shore up culture and to stigmatize and expel anything which is
defined as impure, strangely attractive precisely because it is
forbidden, taboo, threatening to cultural order' (Hall, 1997: 237).
Throughout the centuries, symbolic boundaries have been very powerful in
maintaining separation between nations and individuals. Since its first
contacts with the Arab world, t**he West has developed a set of
stereotypes depicting Arabs as uncivilized and
violent**]{.underline}**.** One of the most prominent texts that capture
this historical encounter is the 12th century French epic poem 'The Song
of Rolland.' The Enlightenment, a period during which philosophers
ranked societies along an evolutionary scale from 'barbarism' to
'civilization', enormously contributed to the vulgarization of this
ideology. With the spread of colonization during the 19th century, a
well organized scholarship devoted to the representation of 'Otherness'
emerged as a defining moment in this cross-cultural history. In the
United States, a similar ideology evolved throughout the 20th century[.
From 1945 onward, the United States became increasingly involved with
the Arab world and Israel]{.underline}. As a staunch supporter of
Israel, America found itself in a difficult position to negotiate its
preeminence in a world of competitive interests. Media corporations took
an active role in redefining American cultural and political agendas.
Representation of the Middle East in mainstream American media Many
media experts in the United States would argue that American media cover
the Middle East within the worldview of a primarily Western audience.
The coverage will thus remain negative and stereotypical unless a
redefinition of cultural differences between the United States and the
Middle East is negotiated. [**Diplomatic historians approach U.S.
foreign policy toward the Middle East from a rational perspective
privileging American interests** in the region.]{.underline} Culture, in
this context, plays a subordinate role. In this institutional framework,
news media can be seen as a driving force behind political mobilization,
both domestically and internationally. The media fosters stereotypical
representations of Middle Eastern cultures and peoples and promote
misunderstanding and intolerance in the mainstream American culture.
Since 9/11 and the invasion of Iraq, [these negative representations
became even more anchored in the American cultural
imaginary]{.underline}. Media apparatuses contribute enormously to the
construction of these images and symbols rather than construct a
conceptual model that sheds light on the complex relationship between
the media, culture, and the political process. In the United States,
despite the fact that Arabs have significantly contributed to the well
being of this nation for at least the last two centuries, negative
representations of this ethnic group abound in scope and intensity. The
constructed images manipulated throughout time have delegated Arabs to
second degree citizens, unable to embrace the secular ideals of the
Western worldview. In this respect, [**the representation of Middle
Easterners in the American media is articulated within the framework of
a binary oppositional dynamics where the Middle East is classified as an
undesired space of barbarism and tyranny**.]{.underline} As cultural
critic Stuart Hall puts it, 'binary oppositions are crucial for all
classification/establish a difference to facilitate the tasks of
organizing systems of perceptions and classifications' (1997: 226[).
This system of classification is elaborated to maintain oppositional
relationships between the civilized and the uncivilized, etc. and **to
create an atmosphere of fear and discomfort to enhance 'difference' for
the purpose of controlling the Other**]{.underline}. In this context,
misrepresentation becomes an effective instrument for advancing
political agendas. Throughout the history of the West, negative
portrayals have been used to develop means by which the imperial project
can be achieved through visual representations. These representations
serve as a popular medium to create a link between the Imperial eye and
the domestic imagination. In France for example, the Colonial Exhibition
at the end of the 19th century served to capture the relationship
between the empire and its 'domestic other'. Representation is a complex
phenomenon, especially when dealing with cultural differences. It
engages emotions, attitudes, reactions and tries to control the viewer's
fears and questions. It also promotes a set of cultural values that
respond to the anxieties of the viewer. In this context, the
Middle-Easterner in American popular media is defined according to these
historical and cultural paradigms. Besides his barbarism and his
violence, he is also depicted as belonging to the realm of emotions,
violent savage and blood thirsty. Mainstream images of the Arab in the
American media operate according to a dynamics of cultural distortions;
the Arab is always portrayed as closer to nature than culture,
genetically incapable of 'civilized' refinements. The concept of
'Naturalization' connotes the impossibility of Arabs to embrace culture.
Therefore, [they are imprisoned in a space of stability and of fixed
'difference' and meaning. They are beyond history and incapable of
embracing cultural emancipation.]{.underline}

### Link -- Middle East 

#### The aff's understanding of the middle east is founded upon a racist otherization which ensures unending warfare and genocide

education at Syracuse, MA in international education from NYU, 1-21-14,
"Education as Warfare?: Mapping Securitized Education Interventions as
War on Terror Strategy," *Geopolitics* Volume 19 Issue 1)

To begin, [portraying education as an issue of US national security
relies first on the representation of a menacing brown Other looming in
the dangerous, lawless Middle East. The US state illustrates the
landscapes of faraway places and makes them intelligible to the US
public in ways that support the war machine.]{.underline} [The
state-sponsored 9/11 Commission Report that details the events leading
up to the September 11 attacks, for example, explains that "the
country\'s vast unpoliced regions make Pakistan attractive to extremists
seeking refuge and recruits and also provide a base for operations
against coalition forces in Afghanistan]{.underline}." 26 The Report
names the "north-south nexus of Kandahar-Quetta-Karachi ... the
Baluchistan region of Pakistan ... and the sprawling city of Karachi" as
"centers of Islamist extremism." 27 Moreover, the Report offers that
"Afghanistan was the incubator for al-Qaeda and for the 9/11 attacks"
and where "Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters have regrouped ..." 28 Part of
the United States' "global strategy," the Report asserts, must be to
focus on the "importance of Pakistan in the struggle against Islamist
terrorism" as "within Pakistan\'s borders are 150 million Muslims,
scores of al Qaeda terrorists, many Taliban fighters and -- perhaps --
Usama Bin Ladin." 29 [The Report articulates the threat the Middle East
region and brown bodies putatively pose to US national security,
especially as vast swaths of land putatively incubate and breed
terrorism]{.underline}. Further, the Report obfuscates the borders of
Afghanistan and Pakistan by moving in and out of analyses of each
country with little articulation of difference. By collapsing rural
Pakistan and Afghanistan into a singular region that breeds extremism,
this narrative narrowly locates and conflates terrorism as originating
from Afghanistan and Pakistan and operating indistinguishably through
brown bodies. [Flattening the complex histories and politics of each
country help to portray the Middle East as terrifyingly suffused with
terrorists. Danger and threat to US security are mapped onto brown
bodies wholesale and without disambiguation]{.underline}. Likewise, the
Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) ran a 'backgrounder' information
report, "Terrorism Havens: Afghanistan." 30 This report offers in
response to the question, "What was Afghanistan\'s role in the September
11 attack" that "thanks to the ruling Taliban -- Muslim fundamentalists
who imposed radical Islamic rule on the country -- Afghanistan had
become a base for terrorists, namely Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda
training camps." 31 [After constructing Afghanistan as a safe place for
terrorism to multiply, the CFR Report celebrates the US war in
Afghanistan]{.underline}, arguing that "U.S. and coalition forces still
have a strong presence in the country, where they continue to put down
scattered insurgent attacks against the coalition and the government."
32 [This fearful representation of the rural Middle East -- a haven for
fundamentalism -- centres the security of the United States' homeland
while creating more vulnerable and more violent situations for the
demonised Other]{.underline}. [We see this Bush-era depiction at work
again in a May 2012 New York Times article, which reports that the
current Obama administration assumes "all military-age men in a strike
zone as combatants ... unless there is explicit intelligence
posthumously proving them innocent]{.underline}." 33 [This framing
constructed by the president conflates all brown men and boys in the
Middle East as violent enemy combatants]{.underline}. By this US
account, [brown men and teenage boys are indiscriminately marked as
"insurgents without discrimination and their deaths were dismissed as
being of no account]{.underline}." 34 [This narrative constitutes all
brown men as serious threats to US security, a conceptual strategy used
to justify drone strikes in the Middle East with impunity and to deny
civilian deaths]{.underline}. 35 Popular US [media provide few
alternative scripts to disavow or complicate how the US public
apprehends the brown Other]{.underline}. Drawing from critical
geopolitics, [this is the power of the performative work of discourse:
it renders particular hegemonic imaginative geographies as the singular
way of knowing brown bodies]{.underline} and how to secure the US
homeland. As Gregory reminds us, "[The war on terror is an attempt to
establish a new global narrative in which the power to narrate is vested
in a particular constellation of power and knowledge within the United
States of America" that then "license\[s\] the unleashing of exemplary
violence against \[the Other\]."]{.underline} 36 [These brief but
important examples underscore how the US state and mainstream media
describe the Middle East using "danger words" associated with a "chaotic
outside," a threat to the home, a place portrayed as a "refuge or
sanctuary in a heartless world."]{.underline} 37 In other words, [the
manufactured threat of the outside mobilises action to protect and
defend the home.]{.underline} Similarly, [Hannah refers to this
particular grand narrative as the "ticking-bomb scenario," which
"prompts a reimagining of the landscapes of everyday life as suffused
with an unacceptably high level of risk]{.underline}" 38 [in order to
justify various forms of torture and detention without
trial]{.underline}. [The US defends the use of these violent measures,
otherwise illegal and illegitimate, to the public by explaining that
these practices abate terror and tame these lawless terrorist havens in
order to ensure personal and national security]{.underline} 39 That is,
[the fearful US portrayal of the Middle East has productive force as it
authorises military intervention to eliminate the threat such barbaric
places and people pose]{.underline}.

### Link -- Miscalculation

#### Fears of Accidental War are not material but a product of fear of difference and nuclear hysteria.

**Seng '02** (Tan See, Prof of Security Studies @ IDSS Singapore, July
2002, \"What Fear Hath Wrought: Missile Hysteria and The Writing of
America, IDSS Commentary No. 28,
http://www.sipri.org/contents/library/0210.pdf)

Few, to be sure, would doubt the sincerity of Secretary Rumsfeld when he
averred last June: \"I don\'t think vulnerability is a (viable)
policy.\"84 Clearly, Washington\'s preoccupation with missile defence
has much to do with the Bush Administration\'s concern over what it
perceives as the strategic vulnerability of America to potential
ballistic missile attack. Nonetheless, as important as debates over
whether or not the \"missile threat\" actually exists are to the study
and practice of international relations, [what is]{.underline} equally
if not more [fundamental is the question of how discourses of danger
figure in the incessant writing of \"America\" - a particular and quite
problematic identity that owes its materiality to textual inscriptions
of difference and Otherness. Missile hysteria in US national security
discourse cannot be simplistically reduced to the level of an
ideological explanation]{.underline} - certainly not according to the
classic formulation of Mannheim\'s. 85 Rather, what this paper has
demonstrated is [the centrality of difference and deferral in discourse
to the identity of America - a discourse of danger, fear, and
vulnerability posed by potential missile attacks against the US from
\"rogue states\" and accidental or unauthorized missile launches from a
particular \"China\" or \"Russia.\"]{.underline} The argument maintained
here has been that [a particular representation of America does not
exist apart from the very differences that allegedly threaten that
representation]{.underline}, just as the particular America of recent
lore did not exist apart from Cold War-related discourses of danger. If
missile defence is (as Bauman, cited earlier, has put it) the
\"foolproof recipe\" for exorcising the ghosts or demons of missile
hysteria, then Bush\'s [national security advisors are the exorcists and
shamans as well as the constructors of national insecurity via missile
hysteria.]{.underline} 86 However, the argument has not been that the
Administration, the Rumsfeld Commission, and other missile defence
enthusiasts fabricated, ex nihilo, a ballistic missile threat against
the US by means of a singular, deliberate \"act,\" which is what some
constructivists in international relations, conspiracy theorists, and
partisan Democrats - an interesting if not motley collectivity - would
have us believe. Nor has it been that language and discourse is
\"everything\" as linguistic idealists would have us imagine. Rather,
[through reiterative and coordinated practices by which discourse
produces the effects that it names, a certain normative representation
of America \"emerges\" - wrought, as it were, by fear and written into
being by missile hysteria.]{.underline}

### Link -- NATO Alliance

#### Their faith in NATO enacts a security framework which is bound to a neoliberal white supremacist policing of global affairs. Claims of NATO's neutrality are the result of a view-from-nowhere anthropology that contributes to a concealed system of global policing 

**Forte '12** (Maximillian, Professor of Sociology at Concordia
University, "Militanthro: Anthropology and the Study of NATO and the
U.S. Military", 11/23/2012)

Two articles to which I want to draw attention discuss the important
issues of research methodology for anthropologists studying NATO and the
U.S. military. For those who do not have paid access to these
publications, I will summarize some of the key points. Secondly, I will
make some additional comments for those interested in pursuing research
in these areas. The first article, published in 2003 in Anthropology
Today, is by Gregory Feldman, titled: "Breaking Our Silence on NATO."
Feldman begins by stating a problem, which starts with his observation
that [while anthropologists had studied and written about the expansion
of the European Union into the former Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe,
none had mentioned the parallel and almost simultaneous expansion of
NATO into this same area:]{.underline} "[In contrast to its approach to
EU enlargement, however, anthropology has remained nearly silent about
the enlargement of NATO, the most powerful military alliance in history.
Why the silence about an international organization with lethal powers
to which the vast majority of European countries either belongs or will
soon belong?"]{.underline} (p. 1) Feldman provides three possible
answers for why that is the case. The first, one that is very dated
(likely dating back to around 1991), is that NATO is no longer assumed
to be as relevant as the EU, and that Russia is no longer the enemy, nor
is NATO needed given European integration efforts. [Unsurprisingly, one
mistake being made here is to view NATO only within the confines of
Europe, confines that NATO itself does not respect. Such a confining
European framework, "casts the alliance as something contained within a
bounded Europe stretching from the Atlantic to the Urals in which the
inhabitants share a (teleological) history 'from Plato to NATO'.
"]{.underline} (p. 1) But, as Feldman commented, ["NATO's role is
evidently no longer to protect Europe from itself. Rather, 'NATO is
there to protect rich, white capitalist countries (plus Turkey) from
poor, brown ones']{.underline} as a former student from one of the
latter once noted. [NATO's identity is now constituted in opposition to
'security risks' identified in the South in the form of migration,
international drug and human trafficking and terrorism.]{.underline} The
invocation of Article Five shortly after 11 September 2001 accelerated,
rather than initiated, this process. [NATO's current reconfiguration of
purpose relies on a discourse of military as essential attribute of
nationhood, in which its member states must repel what is implicitly
construed as a 'civilizational' threat."]{.underline} (p. 1) From here
Feldman proceeds to pose two questions that he is sure will and should
interest anthropologists, concerning national identities: "[An
anthropology of NATO could begin by addressing two inextricably linked
questions: how does inclusion in NATO regiment debates about national
identity in its member states, and what are the effects of this on those
European countries excluded from NATO and who by their definition as
Other contribute to the construction of this identity?]{.underline}"
(p. 1) The second answer, or assumption, that Feldman challenges
interested me much more, because [it involves the confining and narrow
assumptions that have become part of the mainstream in current
Anglo-American anthropology. This assumption is that NATO policy (and
actions, we must add), do not involve "ordinary people" and are thus for
some reason "outside the purview of
anthropology/ethnography"]{.underline} (p. 1). [NATO is thus cast as
removed from "everyday life". So what are the problems with this
view]{.underline}. To summarize Feldman's response, the problems can be
listed as: [This view neglects the indirect social and economic impacts
on ordinary people as a result of maintaining excessively large
militaries designed for foreign intervention; It glosses over the
identification of nation with the military]{.underline}; [NATO is not
just a military organization confined to Brussels, but "rather it is a
function of socially reproduced discourses of military, state, nation
and even civilization"]{.underline} (p. 2); [and,]{.underline} [NATO's
effects are localizable and therefore accessible to
anthropologists.]{.underline} The third assumption challenged by Feldman
is that, "[NATO precludes ethnography because its Brussels headquarters
is even more secretive than the European Commission. An anthropology of
NATO necessitates ethnography at headquarters, which is not feasible. No
anthropologist will gain ethnographic access to the elites working in
Brussels, unlike those who have undertaken ethnographies of the European
Commission"]{.underline} (p. 2) Feldman's response is [that this view is
an antiquated one that privileges access to specific (usually "remote")
locations, rather than being in line with more contemporary arguments in
anthropology that reconceptualize "the field" as multiple, interlocking
social and political formations]{.underline}. Where [Feldman came
closest to producing a really challenging answer that opens up horizons,
is in pursuing this line of the geographical decentering of research and
what this means for participant observation: "It is not that participant
observation is irrelevant or unnecessary, but in instances where
face-to-face interaction does not address the necessary research
question, anthropologists should use alternative methods that focus on
non-localizable sites to expose the culturally produced logic
structuring unequal social-political relations"]{.underline} (p. 2,
emphasis added) [There is a genealogy here too, with such ideas
stretching back further in anthropology than some students might
assume,]{.underline} or might have been told. Feldman, thus cites Laura
Nader from over 30 years ago, who drew on Sol Tax before her, and argued
that "[anthropologists should 'shuffle around the value placed on
participant observation' if they are to study the most important
problems of the world today"]{.underline} (p. 2). As an example,
[Feldman points to one of Hugh Gusterson's chosen field sites, one
which, "consisted of a leading foreign policy journal, International
Security, in which...\[security studies\] intellectuals published
articles]{.underline} between 1986 and 1989, [the final years of the
Cold War]{.underline}. This journal was a crucial target of study for
several reasons: [its contributors' status and influence, its mediating
position between academia and government foreign policy circles, the
prestigious universities that support it, its mix of theoretical and
policy-oriented articles, and its acclaimed coverage of the nuclear arms
race and the global balance of power. A range of geographically
disparate but highly influential actors converged on the pages of
International Security..."]{.underline} (p. 2) Those who would
especially appreciate this line of [argument]{.underline} are those
[engaged in what is varyingly called virtual ethnography, cyber
anthropology, or digital studies, and even media studies]{.underline}
(see for example Elizabeth Bird's The Audience in Everyday Life: Living
in a Media World, which takes to task the conventional meanings of
ethnography, and even disputes the concept of an "audience").

### Link -- North Korea

#### Their construction of North Korea as a hostile threat makes their impacts self-actualizing 

**Cumings '15** (Bruce, distinguished service professor in history at
the University of Chicago, "Getting North Korea wrong," Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists, Vol. 71(4)p. 64--76)

[Across the American political spectrum, the general view of North Korea
is that it is an evil regime]{.underline}; Bush was not alone in that
regard. Perhaps it is [this view]{.underline} that [inhibits serious
investigative reporting and debate on North Korea. That
deficiency]{.underline}, in turn, [means that even the highest officials
often know next to nothing about their North Korean
adversary]{.underline}. In his recent memoir, former Defense Secretary
Leon Panetta writes about the Korean conflict as if he just discovered
it, with a boilerplate description of his visit to Panmunjom that could
have been written 40 years ago. In passing, Panetta trots out a
venerable shibboleth from the Orientalist playbook: He eyeballs an
"inscrutable" North Korean soldier across the demilitarized zone, "just
as inscrutable as the regime behind him." Therefore Washington doesn't
know much about the North---"it is an exasperatingly difficult culture
to observe and understand"---[Washington's "insights into the regime
were few and shallow," and the regime was just "infuriatingly hard to
penetrate."]{.underline} But Panetta is curiously matter-of-fact in
saying that "if North Korea moved across the border," the United States
would command the South Korean military and defend the South, "including
the use of nuclear weapons if necessary." Just like hairtrigger
protocols for nuclear weapons, [US forces in Korea are ready to "fight
tonight,"]{.underline} and during his tenure [the chance of war in Korea
was "ever present and imminent"]{.underline} (Panetta, 2014: 274"276).
[This is]{.underline} a naive but [telling]{.underline} passage. [A
small Asian country is "inscrutable" and that fact is infuriating: Power
needs to know]{.underline}, and why don't they let us know everything we
want to know? Following the failed launch of a North Korean longrange
rocket, [Panetta]{.underline} gave an interview to CNN in Brussels on
April 19, 2012 in which he said that the United States is prepared for
"any contingency" when it comes to dealing with North Korea. He
[told]{.underline} his [hosts: "We're within an inch of war]{.underline}
almost [every day in that part of the world]{.underline}, and we just
have to be very careful about what we say and what we do" (CNN Politics,
2012.)

### Link -- Nuclear Fear

#### The naturalization of nuclear war is a tool used to generate fear and shapes the citizen psyche through securitization; Cold war proves.

**Masco '14** (Joseph, is Professor of Anthropology at the University of
Chicago; "The Theater of Operations"; Duke University Press; 45-65)

Has any nation-state invested as profoundly in ruins as Cold War
America? Although many societies have experienced mo- ments of
self-doubt about the future, perhaps even contemplating the ruins that
might be left behind as testament to their exis- tence, it took American
ingenuity to transform ruination into a form of nation building. In this
regard, t[he invention of the atomic bomb proved to be utterly
transformative for Ameri- can society: it not only provided the
inspiration for a new U.S. geopolitical strategy---one that ultimately
enveloped the earth in advanced military technology and colonized
everyday life with the minute-to-minute possibility of nuclear war---but
it also pro- vided officials with a new means of engaging and
disciplining citizens in everyday life. For U.S. policy makers, the Cold
War arms race transformed the apocalypse not only into a technosci-
entific project and a geopolitical paradigm, but also a powerful new
domestic political resource.]{.underline} Put differently, a new kind of
social contract was formed in the first decade of the nuclear age in the
United States, one based not on the protection and improvement of
everyday life but rather on the national contemplation of ruins. Known
initially as civil defense, the project of building the bomb and commu-
nicating its power to the world turned engineering ruins into a form of
international theater. Nuclear explosions, matched with large-scale
emergency response exercises, became a means of de- veloping the bomb as
well as of imagining nuclear warfare (see, for example, Vanderbilt 2002;
Glasstone and Dolan 1977; Kahn 1960). This test program would ultimately
transform the United States into the most nuclear-bombed country on
earth, distributing its environmental, eco- nomic, and health effects to
each and every U.S. citizen.1 By the mid-1950s it was no longer a
perverse exercise to imagine one's home and city devas- tated, on fire
and in ruins; it had become a formidable public ritual---a core act of
governance, technoscientific practice, and democratic participation.
Indeed, in early Cold War America it became a civic obligation to
collec- tively imagine, and at times theatrically enact, the physical
destruction of the nation-state.2 It is this specific nationalization of
death that I wish to explore in this chapter, assessing not only the
first collective formulations of nuclear fear in the United States but
also the residues and legacies of that project for contemporary American
society. Today we live in a world populated with newly charred
landscapes and a production of ruins that speaks directly to this
foundational moment in American national culture (see Stoler with Bond
2006). [The notions of danger, preemption, and emergency response that
inform the U.S. War on Terror derive meaning from the promises and
institutions made by the Cold War security state. Indeed, the logics of
nuclear fear informing that multigenerational state- and nation-building
enterprise exist now as a largely inchoate, but deeply embedded, set of
as- sumptions about power and threat. How Americans have come to under-
stand mass death at home and abroad has much to do with the legacies of
the Cold War nuclear project, and the peculiar psychosocial consequences
of attempting to build the nation through the contemplation of nuclear
ruins.]{.underline} What follows is largely a study of visual culture,
and specifically the domestic deployment of images of a ruined United
States for ideological effect. [I argue that key aspects of U.S.
security culture have been formed in relation to images of nuclear
devastation: the constitution of the mod- ern security state in the
aftermath of World War II mobilized the atomic bomb as the basis for
American geopolitical power, but it also created a new citizen-state
relationship mediated by nuclear fear.]{.underline} This chapter
considers the lasting effects of nation building through nuclear fear by
tracking the production and ongoing circulation of nuclear ruins from
the Cold War's balance of terror through the current War on Terror. It
is not an exercise in viewer response but rather charts the development
and circulation of a specific set of ideas and images about ultimate
danger. I begin with a discussion of the early Cold War project known as
civil defense and track how the specific images created for domestic
consumption as part of that campaign continued to circulate as
afterimages in the popular films of the 1980s and 1990s.3 I show that
the early Cold War state sought explicitly to militarize U.S. citizens
through contemplating the end of the nation- state, creating in the
process a specific set of ideas and images of collective danger that
continues to inform American society in powerful and in- creasingly
complex ways. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on New York and
Washington in 2001, the affective coordinates of the Cold War arms race
provided specific ideological resources to the state, which once again
mobilized the image of a United States in nuclear ruins to enable war.
Ultimately, this chapter follows Walter Benjamin's call to interrogate
the aestheticized politics that enable increasing militarization and
that allow citizens to experience their own destruction as an "aesthetic
pleasure of the first order" (1969, 242).4 Be Afraid but Don't Panic!
The disaster ruins everything, all the while leaving everything intact.
. . . To think the disaster (if this is possible, and it is not possible
inasmuch as we suspect that the disaster is thought) is to have no
longer any future in which to think it. ---Maurice Blanchot, The Writing
of the Disaster Nuclear ruins are never the end of the story in the
United States---they always offer a new beginning. In the early Cold War
period, ruins become the markers of a new kind of social intimacy
grounded in highly detailed renderings of theatrically rehearsed mass
violence. The intent of these public spectacles---nuclear detonations,
city evacuations, duck-and-cover drills---was not defense in the classic
sense of avoiding violence or destruc- tion but rather a psychological
reprogramming of the American public for life in a nuclear age. [The
central project of the early nuclear state was to link U.S.
institutions---military, industrial, legislative, academic---for the
pro- duction of the bomb, while calibrating public perceptions of the
nuclear danger to enable that project.5 As Blanchot suggests, this
effort to think through the ultimate crisis colonized everyday life as
well as the future, while fundamentally missing the actual disaster. The
scripting of disaster in the imagination has profound social effects: it
defines the conditions of insecurity, renders other threats invisible,
and articulates the terms of both value and loss. In the United States,
civil defense was always a willful act of fabulation, an official
fantasy designed to promote an image of nuclear war that would be above
all other things politically useful. It also installed an idea of an
American community under total, immediate, and unending threat, creating
the terms for a new kind of nation building that demanded an
unprecedented level of militarism in everyday life as the minimum basis
for collective security.]{.underline} After the Soviet Union's first
nuclear detonation in 1949, U.S. policy makers committed themselves to a
new geopolitical strategy that would ul- timately dominate American
foreign policy for the remainder of the twen- tieth century. The policy
of containment, as formalized in a report to the president by the
National Security Council, known as nsc 68, proposed as a response to
the Soviet bomb a total mobilization of American society based on the
experience of World War II.6 nsc 68 articulates the terms of a per-
manent [wartime posture funded by an ever-expanding domestic economy,
transforming consumerism into the engine of a new kind of militarized
geopolitics.]{.underline} The report identifies internal dissent as
perhaps the greatest threat to the project of the Cold War and calls for
a new campaign to disci- pline citizens in preparation for life under
the constant shadow of nuclear war. Thus, in the White House, [nuclear
fear was immediately understood to be not only the basis of American
military power, but also a means of in- stalling a new normative reality
in the United States, one that could consoli- date political power at
the federal level by reaching into the internal lives of citizens.
Nuclear danger became a complex new political ideology,]{.underline}
both mobilizing the global project of the Cold War (fought increasingly
on co- vert terms internationally) and installing a powerful means of
controlling domestic political debates about the terms of security. By
focusing Ameri- cans on an imminent end of the nation-state, federal
authorities mobilized the bomb to create the Cold War consensus of
anticommunism, capitalism, and military expansion. Defense intellectuals
in the administrations of presidents Harry Tru- man and Dwight
Eisenhower, however, worried that nuclear terror could become so
profound under the terms of an escalating nuclear arms race that the
American public would be unwilling to support the military and
geopolitical agenda of the Cold War.7 The immediate challenge, as U.S.
nu- clear strategists saw it, was to avoid both an apathetic public
(which might just give up when faced with the emerging destructive power
of the Soviet nuclear arsenal) and a terrorized public (which would be
unable to func- tion cognitively) (Oakes 1994, 34; see also George
2003). For example, a highly influential civil defense study from 1952,
Report of the Project East River, argued that civilian response to a
nuclear attack would be all-out panic and mob behavior: American
society, the report concluded, would not only be at war with the Soviets
but also at war with itself as society vio- lently broke down along race
and class lines (Associated Universities 1952). [A long Cold War
consequently required not only a new geopolitics pow- ered by nuclear
weapons, but also new forms of psychological discipline at home. One of
the earliest and most profound projects of the Cold War state was thus
to deploy the bomb as a mechanism for accessing and controlling the
emotions of citizens.]{.underline} As Guy Oakes has documented, [the
civil defense programs of the early Cold War were designed to
"emotionally manage" U.S. citizens through nuclear fear]{.underline}
(1994, 47). The formal goal of this state program was to trans- form
"nuclear terror," [which was interpreted by U.S. officials as a
paralyzing emotion, into "nuclear fear," an affective state that would
allow citizens to function in a time of crisis]{.underline} (Oakes 1994,
62--63; see also Associated Univer- sities 1952). [By militarizing
everyday life through nuclear fear, the Cold War state sought to both
normalize catastrophic danger and politically deploy an image of
it.]{.underline} Rather than offering citizens an image of safety or of
a war that could end in victory, the early Cold War state sought instead
to cali- brate everyday American life to the minute-to-minute
possibility of nuclear warfare. In addition to turning the domestic
space of the home into the front line of the Cold War (see McEnaney
2000; Elaine May 1990), civil defense officials argued that citizens
should be prepared every second of the day to deal with a potential
nuclear attack. [The civil defense program thus shifted responsibility
for nuclear war from the state to its citizens by mak- ing the enemy
public panic, not nuclear war itself.]{.underline} It was, in other
words, up to citizens to take responsibility for their own survival in
the nuclear age. Val Peterson, as director of the new Federal Civil
Defense Administra- tion (fcda), argued: Ninety percent of all emergency
measures after an atomic blast will depend on the prevention of panic
among the survivors in the first 90 seconds. Like the A-bomb, panic is
fissionable. It can produce a chain reaction more deeply destructive
than any explosive known. If there is an ultimate weapon, it may well be
mass panic---not the A-bomb. . . . War is no longer confined to the
battlefield. Every city is a potential battleground, every citizen a
target. There are no safe rear areas. Panic on Main Street can be as
decisive as panic in the front lines. (1953, 1--2) Panic is fissionable.
Indeed, Peterson argued that Americans were particu- larly "susceptible
to panic" and offered a checklist on how citizens could become "panic
stoppers" by training themselves for nuclear attack and be- coming like
"soldiers" at home (V. Peterson 1953, 17; see figure 1.1). Thus, the
official message from the early Cold War state was that extreme
self-control was the best way for citizens to fight a nuclear war,
revealing a national project to both colonize and normalize everyday
life with nuclear fear. By declaring a war on panic, as Jackie Orr
(2006, 14) has so powerfully shown, the national security state remade
the individual as a permanently milita- rized, if insecure, node in the
larger Cold War system. [Civil defense plan- ners sought ultimately to
saturate the public space with a specific idea about nuclear war, one
that would nationalize mass death and transform post- nuclear ruins into
a new American frontier, simply another arena for citi- zens to assert
their civic spirit, fortitude, and ingenuity. At the heart of the
project was an effort to install psychological defenses against the
exploding bomb, as well as a belief in the possibility of national unity
in a postnuclear environment---all via the contemplation of nuclear
ruins.]{.underline} Indeed, as the Eisenhower administration promoted an
Atoms for Peace program around the world to emphasize the benefits of
nuclear energy and provide a positive vision of atomic science, it
pursued the opposite emo- tional management strategy within the United
States (Osgood 2006; Craig 1998; Hewlett and Holl 1989). [The domestic
response to the growing Soviet nuclear arsenal was a new kind of social
engineering project, pursued with the help of social scientists and the
advertising industry, to teach citizens a specific kind of nuclear fear
while normalizing the nuclear crisis.]{.underline} The goal, as one
top-secret study put it in 1956, was an "emotional adaptation" of the
citizenry to nuclear danger, a program of "psychological defense" aimed
at "feelings" that would unify the nation in the face of apocalyptic
every- day threat (Panel on the Human Effects of Nuclear Weapons
Development 1956, 10--11).8 This took the form of the largest domestic
propaganda cam- paign to date in American history.9 Designed to mobilize
all Americans for a long Cold War, the civil defense effort involved
town meetings and educa- tion programs in every public school; it also
sought to take full advantage of mass media---television, radio, and
particularly film. By the mid-1950s, the fcda saturated newspapers and
magazines with nuclear war adver- tisements and could claim that its
radio broadcasts reached an estimated audience of 175 million Americans
each year.10 [As the campaign evolved, the fcda turned increasingly to
film, cre- ating a library of short subjects on nuclear destruction and
civil defense that were shown across the country in schools, churches,
community halls, and movie theaters.]{.underline} The fcda concluded:
"Each picture will be seen by a minimum of 20,000,000 persons, giving an
anticipated aggregate audi- ence of more than half a billion for the
civil defense film program of 1955" (Federal Civil Defense
Administration 1956, 78). Thus, a key to winning the Cold War was to
produce the bomb not only for military use but also in cinematic form
for the American public. It is important to recognize that the
circulation of these images relied on a simultaneous censorship of
images from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. U.S.
authorities made available images of destroyed buildings from Japan but
withheld the detailed effects of the atomic bomb on the human body, as
well as some firsthand accounts of the aftermath of the bombings.11
Thus, an immediate project of the nuclear state was to calibrate the
image of atomic warfare for the American public through the mass
circulation of certain images of the bomb and the censorship of all
others. In this way, officials sought to mobilize the power of mass
media to transform nuclear attack from an unthinkable apocalypse into an
opportunity for psychological self- management, civic responsibility,
and, ultimately, governance. Civil de- fense officials sought to produce
an "atomic-bomb--proof society" in which nuclear conflict was normalized
alongside all other threats, making public support for the Cold War
sustainable. Civil defense theorists argued that citizens could achieve
this contradic- tory state of productive fear (simultaneously mobilized
and normalized) only by gaining intimacy with nuclear warfare itself, by
becoming familiar with the language of nuclear effects from blast, heat,
and fire to radioac- tive fallout. Irving Janis, a rand analyst,
concluded that the goal of civil defense was ultimately an "emotional
inoculation" of the American public (1951, 220). This inoculation, he
cautioned, needed to be finely calibrated: the simulated nuclear
destruction in civil defense exercises, as well as the film footage of
atomic tests released to the public, had to be formidable enough to
affectively mobilize citizens but not so terrifying as to invalidate the
concept of defense altogether (a distinct challenge in an age of
increas- ingly powerful thermonuclear weapons, which offered no hope of
survival to most urban residents). [A central project of civil defense
was thus to pro- duce fear but not terror, anxiety but not panic, and to
inform the public about nuclear science but not fully educate it about
nuclear war.]{.underline} [The goal was a micro regulation of a national
community at the emotional level.]{.underline} In other words, alongside
the invention of a new security state grounded in nuclear weapons was a
new public culture of insecurity in the United States: figuring the
United States as a global nuclear superpower was coterminous with a
domestic campaign to reveal the country as completely vulnerable,
creating a citizen-state relationship increasingly mediated by forms of
in- choate but ever-present nuclear fear. Indeed, one of the first U.S.
civil defense projects of the Cold War was to make every U.S. city a
target, and every U.S. citizen a potential victim, of nuclear attack.
Through the 1950s the fcda circulated increasingly de- tailed maps of
the likely targets of a Soviet nuclear attack, listing U.S. cit- ies in
order of population and ranking them as potential targets. In one 1955
fcda map (see figure 1.2), the top seventy Soviet targets include major
population centers as well as military bases in the United States---
revealing not only the vulnerability of large cities to the bomb, but
also the increasingly wide distribution of military-industrial sites
across the continental United States. As the size of the U.S. and Soviet
bombs grew and the means of their delivery improved (from bombers to
interconti- nental missiles), so did the highly publicized target lists.
Thomas Martin and Donald Latham's 1963 civil defense textbook, Strategy
for Survival, for example, presented a case for 303 ground zeros within
the United States in case of nuclear war: No one can predict that any
one or combination of these cities would be attacked in any future war.
Thus, it might appear that we are trying to know the unknowable, to
predict the unpredictable, to impose a logical rationale upon war which
is, itself, illogical and irrational. But such an inference is
incorrect. It was shown in Chapter 5 that there are good reasons to
believe that a large fraction of these cities would be attacked in a
future war---but what specific cities would be included in this
fraction? Because there is no precise answer to this question, civil
defense planning must assume that all could be potential targets. Any
other approach is thermonuclear Russian Roulette played with 100 million
American lives. (Martin and Latham 1963, 182) Thermonuclear Russian
roulette. Marking every population center with over 50,000 residents a
likely target of nuclear attack, Martin and Latham saw no safe area in
the United States. From New York to Topeka, from Los An- geles to Waco,
from Albuquerque to Anchorage---[each community could increasingly argue
that it was a first-strike target of Soviet attack. Given the expanding
distribution of the nuclear weapons infrastructure (nuclear ma- terial
production sites, scientific laboratories, command and control cen-
ters, and military bases) in U.S. territories, Americans not only
increasingly lived beside nuclear facilities but also worked inside
them. Indeed, citizens were informed from multiple media sources that
their community was the literal front line of the Cold War, with Soviet
thermonuclear warheads poised to attack.12]{.underline} From 1953 to
1961, the yearly centerpiece of the civil defense program was a
simulated nuclear attack on the United States directed by federal au-
thorities (see T. Davis 2002; McEnaney 2000; Oakes 1994). Cities were
des- ignated as victims of nuclear warfare, allowing civic leaders and
politicians to lead theatrical evacuations of the city for television
cameras, followed by media discussions of blast damage versus fire
damage versus fallout, and the expected casualty rates if the attack had
been real. In 1955, for example, the scenario called Operation Alert
involved sixty cities hit by a variety of atomic and hydrogen bombs,
producing over eight million instant deaths and another eight million
radiation victims over the coming weeks (figure 1.3). The scenario
imagined twenty-five million Americans left homeless and fallout
covering some 63,000 square miles of the United States (Federal Civil
Defense Administration 1956; see also Krugler 2006, 126). In the first
decade of the Cold War, Americans acted out their own incineration in
this manner annually, with public officials cheerfully evacuating cities
and evaluating emergency planning, while nuclear detonations in Nevada
and the South Pacific provided new images of fireballs and mushroom
clouds to reinforce the concept of imminent nuclear threat. [The early
Cold War state sought to install a specific idea of the bomb in the
American imagination through these public spectacles, creating a new
psychosocial space between the utopian promise of American technoscience
and the minute-to-minute threat of thermonuclear incineration. It sought
to make contemplating mass death an intimate psychological experience,
while simultaneously claiming that nuclear war could be planned for
alongside tornados, floods, and]{.underline} traffic accidents. [Civil
defense officials ultimately sought to make nuclear war a space for
nation building and thereby bring this new form of death under the
control of the state.]{.underline} Here is how one of the most widely
circulated U.S. civil defense films of the 1950s, Let's Face It,
described the problem posed by nuclear warfare: The tremendous effects
of heat and blast on modern structures raise important questions
concerning their durability and safety. Likewise, the amount of damage
done to our industrial potential will have a se- rious effect upon our
ability to recover from an atomic attack. Trans- portation facilities
are vital to a modern city. The nation's lifeblood could be cut if its
traffic arteries were severed. These questions are of great interest not
only to citizens in metropolitan centers but also to those in rural
areas who may be in a danger zone because of ra- dioactive fallout from
today's larger weapons. We could get many of the answers to these
questions by constructing a complete city at our Nevada Proving Ground
and then exploding a nuclear bomb over it. We could study the effects of
damage over a wide area, under all conditions, and plan civil defense
measures accordingly. But such a gigantic undertaking is not feasible.
We could build a city to bomb it. The problem voiced here is ultimately
one of scientific detail: how can the security state prepare to survive
a nuclear attack if it does not know in detail how every aspect of
American life would respond to the unprecedented effects of the
exploding bomb and the result- ing social confusion? But after denying
the possibility of building an entire city in Nevada simply to destroy
it, the narrator of Let's Face It reveals that the nuclear state has, in
fact, done just that: Instead we build representative units of a test
city. With steel and stone and brick and mortar, with precision and
skill---as though it were to last a thousand years. But it is a weird,
fantastic city. A cre- ation right out of science fiction. A city like
no other on the face of the earth. Homes, neat and clean and completely
furnished, that will never be occupied. Bridges, massive girders of
steel spanning the empty desert. Railway tracks that lead to nowhere,
for this is the end of the line. But every element of these tests is
carefully planned as to its design and location in the area. A variety
of materials and building techniques are often represented in a single
structure. Every brick, beam, and board will have its story to tell.
When pieced together these will give some of the answers, and some of
the information we need to survive in the nuclear age. A weird fantastic
city. [The test city was also an idealized model of the contemporary
American suburb, and by publicizing its atomic destruc- tion the state
was involved in an explicit act of psychological manipula- tion. As we
shall see, the Nevada Test Site was the location of nuclear war
"simulations" that involved real nuclear explosions and model American
cities destroyed in real time for a national audience.]{.underline} Each
ruin in these national melodramas---each element of bombed U.S. material
culture--was presented as a key to solving the "problem" of nuclear
warfare, a means of cracking the code for survival in nuclear conflict.
[But in this effort to control a specific idea of death, the civil
defense strategy also forced citizens to confront the logics of the
nuclear state, allowing many to reclaim and reinvest these same ruins
with a counternarrative and critique.13 Thus, real and imagined nuclear
ruins became the foundation for competing ideas of national community,
producing both resistance to and the normalization of a militarized
society]{.underline}. But even if the early Cold War effort to produce
an "atomic bomb--proof " society failed, we shall see that the
psychosocial leg- acies of this moment continue to haunt and inform U.S.
national culture.14 In the remainder of this chapter, [I offer a visual
history of nuclear ruins in the United States as a means both of
recovering the affective and imagina- tive coordinates of the nuclear
security state and of exploring the lasting impacts of the Cold War
strategy of emotional management on American society in the age of
counterterror.]{.underline} "Cue for Survival" [On May 5, 1955, a
hundred million Americans watched a typical suburban community being
blown to bits by an atomic bomb on live television (]{.underline}Fed-
eral Civil Defense Administration 1955a, 1956). [Many watched from homes
and apartments that were the explicit models for the test city, and saw
man- nequin families posed in casual everyday moments (at the kitchen
table, on the couch, in bed---or watching TV) experience the atomic
blast. Opera- tion Cue was the largest of the civil defense spectacles
staged at the Nevada Test Site: it promised not only to demonstrate the
power of an exploding bomb but also to show citizens exactly what a
postnuclear American city would look like (Federal Civil Defense
Administration 1955b). In addition to the live television coverage, film
footage was widely distributed in the years after the test, with
versions shown in movie theaters and replayed on television. Some of the
most powerful and enduring U.S. images of atomic destruction were
crafted during Operation Cue and remain in circulation to this day.
Thus, in important ways, the broken buildings, charred rubble, and
scorched mannequins produced in Operation Cue continue to structure
contemporary American perceptions of postnuclear ruins, constituting a
kind of ur-text for the nuclear age.]{.underline} As an experiment,
Operation Cue was designed to test the effects of an atomic blast on
residences, utilities, mobile housing, vehicles, warning systems, as
well as a variety of domestic items and bomb shelter designs. Linked to
each of these objects was a specific test program and research team
drawn from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, Atomic Energy
Commission, and fcda. A variety of civil defense exercises were
conducted in the aftermath of the explosion, including rescue
operations, fire control, emergency evacuations by airplane,
communication and sanitation efforts, and mass feeding experiments. The
test city was designed to resemble a "representative" American
community: it was made up of an assortment of current building styles
(ramblers and two-story brick houses, as well as trailers and mobile
homes), a full range of public utility systems (from electronic towers
to propane gas tanks), and numerous types of bomb shelters. There were
experiments designed to protect paper records, including a variety of
office safes located across the test city. Over 150 industrial
associations participated in the test, ensuring that the very latest
consumer items---cars, furniture, clothing, dishes, televisions, and
radios---were installed in the model homes and streets. Hundreds of
civilian participants were invited to inhabit not the pristine pretest
city but the posttest atomic ruins: civilians were simultaneously
witnesses and test subjects, serving as representative "Americans" to be
tested by viewing the blast and participating in mass feeding and other
emergency operations afterward. The formal inhabitants of Operation Cue
were the mannequin families, dressed and theatrically posed to suggest
everyday activities, communicating through their posture and dress that
the bombing was an unexpected intrusion into an intimate, everyday home
space (figure 1.4). [Operation Cue was designed to appeal to a domestic
audience,]{.underline} and par- ticularly to women.15 Unlike previous
civil defense films, Operation Cue (1955) has a female narrator---Joan
Collins---who promises to see the test "through my own eyes and the eye
of the average citizen." [In its effort to produce a bomb-proof society,
the fcda was concerned with document- ing the effects of the bomb on
every aspect of white, middle-class, suburban life]{.underline} (a de
facto recognition that urban centers could not be protected in a nuclear
war; see Galison 2001). The media strategy involved recalibrating
domestic life by turning the nuclear family into a nuclearized family,
pre- programmed for life before, during, and after a nuclear war. Gender
roles were reinforced by dividing responsibility for food and security
in a time of nuclear crisis between women and men. Similarly, the civil
defense cam- paigns in public schools were designed to deploy children
to educate their parents about civil defense. Normative gender roles
were used to reinforce the idea that nuclear crisis was not an
exceptional condition, but one that could be incorporated into everyday
life with minor changes in household technique and a "can do" American
spirit. f particular concern in Operation Cue, for example, were food
tests and mass feeding programs. In each of the model homes, the
pantries and refrigerators were stocked with food. In her voice-over,
Collins under- scores Operation Cue's focus on women, announcing: "As a
mother and housewife, I was particularly interested in the food test
program, a test that included canned and packaged food." Additionally,
food in various types of packaging was buried along the desert test site
to expose it to radiation, and some of the mannequin families were posed
as if they were involved in food preparation at the time of the
detonation. Conceptually, the argu- ment was that at any moment of the
day---while enjoying one's breakfast, for example---the bomb could drop.
Laura McEnaney argues that the fcda sought to create a "paramilitary
housewife" (2000, 109), emotionally and materially in control of her
home and thinking about postnuclear social life. Formally, the fcda was
interested in whether or not food would be too con- taminated to eat in
the immediate aftermath of a blast, and how to feed large groups of
homeless, injured, and traumatized people. Within this scheme for crisis
management, food was positioned as a primary means of calming
individuals' anxieties and establishing social authority (111).
Informally, the goal was to saturate the domestic space of the home with
nuclear logics and civic obligations and to militarize men, women, and
children to withstand either a very long nuclear confrontation or a very
short nuclear war. Food for the test was flown in from Las Vegas,
Chicago, and San Fran- cisco to document the government's ability to
move large quantities of food around the country in a time of emergency.
The fcda report, Effects of Nuclear Explosions on Frozen Food, concludes
that "under emergency con- ditions similar to this exposure, frozen
foods may be used for both military and civilian feeding" (Schmitt 1956,
3), but this conclusion only hints at the scale of this experiment.
Frozen chicken potpies were a privileged test item and were distributed
through the test homes as well as buried in large freez- ers. The pies
were then exposed to nuclear blast and tested for radiation, as well as
nutritional value, color, and taste. Thus, while building increasingly
powerful atomic and thermonuclear weapons, the security state set about
demonstrating to Americans that even if the nation-state disappeared
under nuclear fire, its newly developed prepared foods would still be
edible (making the chicken potpie a curious emblem of modernity in the
process). Like these bomb-proof pies, all commodified aspects of
American life were to be tested against nuclear blast, as the state
sought to demonstrate not only that there could be a postnuclear moment,
but that life in it could be imagined on largely familiar terms.
[Indeed, documenting evidence of material survival after an atomic blast
was ultimately the point of Operation Cue.]{.underline} The mass feeding
project, for example, pulled equipment from the wreckage after the test,
as well as the food from refrigerators and buried canned goods, and
served them to as- sembled participants: this emergency meal consisted
of roast beef, tomato juice, baked beans, and coffee (Federal Civil
Defense Administration 1955b, 67). [The destruction of a model American
community thus became the oc- casion for a giant picnic, with each item
of food marked as having survived the atomic bomb and each witness
positioned as a postnuclear survivor.]{.underline} Additionally, the
emergency rescue group pulled damaged mannequins out of the rubble and
practiced medical and evacuation techniques on them, eventually flying
several charred and broken dummies to off-site hospitals by charter
plane. The formal message of Operation Cue was that the postnuclear
environment would be only as chaotic as citizens allowed, that resources
(food, shelter, medical) would still be present, and that society---if
not the nation-state---would continue. Nuclear war was ultimately
presented as a state of mind that could be incorporated into one's
normative reality: it was simply a matter of emotional preparation and
mental discipline. The mannequin families that were intact after the
explosion were soon on a national tour, complete with tattered and
scorched clothing. J.C. Pen- ney, which had provided the garments,
displayed these postnuclear fami- lies in its stores around the country.
Presenting a detailed before-and-after photographic record of damage to
each figure, the exhibit stated: "These mannikins could have been live
people, in fact, they could have been you."16 Inverting the appeal of a
standard advertising campaign, the exhibit did not make the blue suit or
polka-dot dress the focal point for viewers. Rather, it was the
mannequin as survivor, whose very existence seemed to show that you
could indeed "beat the A-bomb," as one civil defense film of the era
promised. Invited to contemplate life in a postnuclear ruin as the
docile mannequins of civil defense, the national audience for Opera-
tion Cue was caught in a sea of mixed messages about the power of the
state to control the bomb. This kind of ritual enactment did not resolve
the problem of the bomb; instead, it used nuclear fear to focus citizens
on emo- tional self-discipline. It asked them to live on the knife's
edge of a psychotic contradiction---an everyday life founded
simultaneously on total threat and absolute normality---with the stakes
being nothing less than survival itself. [Indeed, although Operation Cue
was billed as a test of "the things we use in everyday
life,]{.underline}" [the full intent of the overall project was to
nationalize nuclear fear and install a new civic understanding via the
contemplation of mass destruction and collective death.]{.underline}
Consider the narrative of Arthur F. Landstreet (the general manager of
the Hotel King Cotton in Memphis, Tennessee), who volunteered to crouch
down in a trench at the Nevada Test Site, about 10,000 feet from ground
zero, and experience the nuclear detonation in Operation Cue. After the
explosion he explained why it was important for ordinary citizens to be
tested on the front line of a nuclear detonation: [Apparently the reason
for stationing civilians at Position Baker was to find out what the
actual reaction from citizens who were not schooled in the atomic field
would be, and to get some idea of what the ordi- nary citizen might be
able to endure under similar conditions. This idea was part of the total
pattern to condition civilians for what they might be expected to
experience in case of atomic attack]{.underline}. . . . Every step of
the bomb burst was explained over and over from the mo- ment of the
first flash of light until the devastating blast. We were asked to make
time tests from the trench to our jeeps. We did this time after time,
endeavoring to create more speed and less loss of motion. We were told
that this was necessary because, if the bomb exploded directly over us
with practically no wind, the fallout would drop immediately downward,
and we would be alerted to get out of the territory. We would have about
5 minutes to get at least 2.5 to 3 miles distant, so it was necessary
that we learn every move perfectly. (Federal Civil Defense
Administration 1955b, 73) [The total pattern to condition civilians.
Physical reactions to the nuclear ex- plosion are privileged in
Landstreet's account, but a corollary project is also revealed: that of
training the participants not to think in a case of emer- gency, but
simply to act. If the first project was an emotional management effort
to familiarize citizens with the exploding bomb---to psychologically
inoculate them against their own apocalyptic imaginations---the latter
project sought simply to control those same bodies, to train and time
their response to official commands.1]{.underline}7 The atomic bomb
extended the docility of the citizen-subject to new levels, as civil
defense sought to absorb the everyday within a new normative reality
imbued with the potential for an imminent and total destruction. This
short-circuiting of the mind and willingness to take orders under the
sign of nuclear emergency reveal the broader scope of the civil defense
project: anesthetizing as well as protecting, producing docility as well
as agency. This effort to document the potentialities of life in a
postnuclear environment met with almost immediate resistance. In
addition to the mounting scientific challenges to the claims of civil
defense, a "mothers against the bomb" movement started in 1959 when two
young parents in New York refused to participate in Operation Alert by
simply taking their children to Central Park rather than to a fallout
shelter (Garrison 2006, 93--95). The widely publicized effects of
radioactive fallout in the 1950s, as well as the move from atomic to
thermonuclear weapons, provided ample evidence that Operation Cue was
not, in the end, a "realistic" por- trait of nuclear warfare.18 Indeed,
when [Operation Cue was re-released in 1964, the following text was
added to the introduction, minimizing the claims of the film: The
nuclear device used was comparatively small. It had an explosive force
of 30 kilotons, equivalent to 30,000 tons of tnt. Whereas some modern
thermonuclear weapons are in the 20-megaton range--- twenty million
tons---more than 600 times as powerful as the bomb shown here, and with
a much wider radius of destruction. In this test, many of the structures
damaged by the 30-kiloton bomb were ap- proximately one mile from
"ground zero." With a 20-megaton blast, they probably would be
obliterated, and comparable damage would occur out to a distance of at
least 8.5 or 9 miles. They probably would be obliterated. Thus, as a
scientific test of everyday ob- jects, Operation Cue had less value over
time, as the effects of blast, fire, and radiation in increasingly
powerful weapons rendered civil defense almost immediately obsolete as a
security concept.]{.underline} In Cold War ideology, however, the
promise of nuclear ruins was deployed by the state to secure the pos-
sibility of a postnuclear remainder, and with it the inevitable
reconstitution of social order. The discourse of "obliteration" here,
however, reveals the technoscientific limitations of that ideological
project, as the destructive reality of thermonuclear warfare radically
limits the possibility of a post- nuclear United States. After the 1963
Limited Test Ban Treaty, U.S nuclear testing went under- ground and the
effects of the exploding bomb were no longer visible. The elimination of
aboveground tests had two immediate effects: it changed the terms of the
public discourse about the bomb, as the state no longer had to
rationalize the constant production of mushroom clouds and the related
health concerns about the effects of radioactive fallout on American
soci- ety; and it locked in place the visual record of the bomb. Thus,
the visual record of the 1945--62 aboveground test program, with its
deep investment in manipulating public opinions and emotions, remains
the visual record of the bomb to this day. As science, Operation Cue was
always questionable, but as national theater it remains a much more
productive enterprise: it created an idealized consumer dream space and
infused it with the bomb, creating the vocabulary for thinking about the
nuclear emergency that con- tinues to inform American politics (see
figures 1.5 and 1.6). [Thus, the motto of Operation Cue---"survival is
your business"---is not an ironic moment of atomic kitsch but rather
reveals the formal project of the nuclear state, underscoring the links
among the production of threat, its militarized re- sponse, and the Cold
War economic program. As an emotional manage- ment campaign, civil
defense proved extraordinarily influential, installing in American
national culture a set of ideas, images, and assumptions about nuclear
weapons that continued to inform Cold War politics and remain powerful
to this day. I turn now to two afterimages of the 1950s civil defense
program, each set roughly a generation apart, to consider the lasting
con- sequences of this era's emotional management strategy, and to
explore the psychosocial effects of deploying highly detailed depictions
of the end of the nation-state as a means of establishing national
community.]{.underline} Afterimage 1: The Day After The anticipation of
nuclear war (dreaded as the fantasy, or phantasm, of a remainderless de-
struction) installs humanity---and through all sorts of relays even
defines the essence of modern humanity---in its rhetorical condition.
---Jacques Derrida, "No Apocalypse, Not Now" [On Sunday, November 20,
1983, a hundred million Americans turned on their televisions to watch
the United States destroyed by Soviet interconti- nental ballistic
missiles (icbms), and a few survivors in Lawrence, Kansas, negotiate
everyday life in a postnuclear environment (see figure 1.7). Watched by
half of the adult population in the United States, The Day After was a
major cultural event, one that refocused public attention on the effects
of radiation, mass casualties, and postnuclear life without a
functioning state. Presented as a "realistic" portrayal, the blast and
radiation effects depicted in the film were supported by statements from
health experts and transformed into a mo- ment of national dialog about
the physical and biological effects of nuclear war (Rubin and Cummings
1989)]{.underline}. Immediately following the film's broad- cast on abc,
the network presented a roundtable discussion of the film and the
current state of nuclear emergency. Public school teachers across the
country advised students to watch The Day After in order to discuss its
implications in class, thereby nationalizing the discussion. Even Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan, whose arms buildup and provocative nuclear rhetoric
helped instigate the film, watched along with his fellow Americans, an-
nouncing after the program that he too had been terrified by its
depiction of nuclear war. In synchronizing a hundred million viewing
subjects, [The Day After created a national community brought together
by images of its own destruction]{.underline}. In doing so, the film
also replayed the official program of Operation Cue with uncanny
precision and demonstrated the enduring national and cultural legacy of
the 1950s emotional management project. The Day After follows several
idealized Midwestern families, document- ing their lives before nuclear
war breaks out and then attempting to survive in a postnuclear world.
The first hour of the film is devoted to everyday life in Lawrence
(against the backdrop of increasing international tensions); the second
hour is devoted to the brief nuclear strike and then life in a
postnuclear environment. The film rehearses the lessons of Operation Cue
with an eerie fidelity: after nuclear attack, the state is absent, and
it is up to citizens to step in to provide order, food, and medical care
to survivors. The key difference between The Day After and Operation Cue
has to do with the nature of survival: although Operation Cue argued
that life was possible after nuclear attack and promoted the idea that
nuclear war was simply another form of everyday risk (alongside weather,
fire, and traffic accidents), The Day After questioned whether life
after nuclear war was worth living.19 The central protagonist of the
story, a doctor played by Jason Robards, is shown in the final scene
dying of radiation sickness, collapsed in what might be the ruins of his
former home, his wife and children long dead from the attack. No
triumphal narrative of survival and reinvention here. Instead, the final
moment of the film issues yet another warning: The catastrophic events
you have witnessed are, in all likelihood, less severe than the
destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear
strike against the United States. It is hoped that the images of this
film will inspire the nations of this earth, their peoples and leaders,
to find the means to avert the fateful day. Less severe than a full
nuclear strike. Thus, the "realism" of The Day After is revealed in the
end to be a deception---just as was the case with the Opera- tion Cue
film a generation earlier---as the filmmakers are forced to admit that
the horror of nuclear war is ultimately beyond the power of cinematic
representation. The simulated realism of the film perfectly illustrates
Derrida's claim that nuclear war is "fabulously textual" because until
it happens it can only be imagined, and once it happens it marks the end
of the human archive (1984, 23). As the only "remainderless event,"
nuclear war is thus in the realm of the sublime, ungraspable and subject
only to displacements, compensa- tions, and misrecognitions (28). [Thus,
by rehearsing nuclear war in the imagination or via civil defense
exercises, one does not master either the event or its aftermath.
Rather, one domesticates an image of a postnuclear world that stands in
for the failure of the imagination to be able to conceive of the end.
This postnuclear imagination is necessarily an arena of cultural work,
as early Cold War officials immediately recognized---one that pro- motes
an idea of order out of the sublime and often becomes a space of pure
ideology. To this end, the consistency of the nuclear tropes presented
in The Day After and the nationalization of the televised event document
the multigenerational power of nuclear ruins in the American
imaginary.]{.underline} A full generation after Operation Cue,
filmmakers could rehearse with startling specificity the entire 1950s
program of civil defense and provoke a national conversation about life
after nuclear war. The state was no longer needed to enact this national
melodrama of destruction because its terms were al- ready deeply
installed in American culture and subject to simple citation and
repositioning. The entertainment industry could now provide the fire-
storm and fallout as "special effects," rehearsing the lessons of
nuclear crisis that a live television audience first experienced in 1955
via a real nuclear detonation in Nevada. This time, however, the ruins
were engineered not to "emotionally inoculate" Americans against nuclear
war, but rather to shock them into action during the nuclear emergency
of the early 1980s. Put differently, the Reagan administration's
escalating arms race and talk of "winnable" nuclear wars (Sheer 1982)
produced a cultural return to the images and logics of Operation Cue,
mobilized this time as a call to political action rather than
normalization. Thus, the form and content of cinematic nuclear
destruction remained largely unchanged from 1955 to 1983, but its
emotional project was inverted from promoting the docility of the
citizen-subject to mobilizing a national community before the bombs
fall. The Day After reenacted the national melodrama articulated in
Opera- tion Cue twenty-eight years earlier with remarkable precision,
but it did so not to produce a bomb-proof society but rather as a de
facto form of nuclear critique. Similarly, activist groups (including
Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Nuclear Freeze Campaign)
used depictions of nuclear warfare---including targeting and blast
damage maps of U.S. cities and medical analyses of radiation
injuries---to counter the escalating military budgets and nuclear
tensions of the late Cold War.20 In other words, the calibration of the
emotional management project was no longer controlled solely by the
government, allowing counterformulations using the same texts and images
that originally structured the Cold War cultural project. Nuclear ruins
are revealed here to be the grammar of nuclear discourse in the United
States---enabling both pronuclear and antinuclear projects--- inevitably
deployed to articulate the affective terms of national belonging. For
despite its implicit nuclear critique and antiwar message, The Day After
continues to mobilize a nuclear-bombed America as a call to community
rather than as a marker of the end of sociability itself. Afterimage 2:
Armageddon and Deep Impact There was a tacit agreement, equally binding
on everyone, that the true state of material and moral ruin in which the
country found itself was not to be described. The darkest aspects of the
final act of destruction, as experienced by the great majority of the
German population, remained under a kind of taboo like a shameful family
secret, a secret that could not even be privately acknowledged. ---W. G.
Sebald, On the Natural History of Destruction Questioning the near total
silence in German literature about everyday life in the bombed-out ruins
of World War II, [Sebald finds an "extraor- dinary faculty for
self-anesthesia shown by a community that seemed to have emerged from a
war of annihilation without any signs of psychological
impairment"]{.underline} (2004, 11). He attributes this absence of
commentary (about life in the ruins of Dresden and other German cities
that were firebombed by the United States) to a collective understanding
that it was Germany that had pioneered mass bombing years earlier, in
Guernica, Warsaw, and Bel- grade (104). Thus, the national repression he
interrogates is double---that of life in the postwar ruins and that of a
prior position as mass bomber--- linking trauma and destruction as part
of the same psychosocial legacy. I suggest that the United States---a
country that did not experience mass bombings in World War II but that
did conduct them, using both conven- tional and nuclear weapons---took
an opposite national and cultural route in the Cold War. For while
nuclear war did not occur after the destruction of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, rather than repress the bomb, American cul- ture proliferated
its meaning and influence. [The bomb became an intimate part of American
popular and political culture, incorporated into a set of ideas, images,
and institutions that were installed in the 1950s and soon functioned
outside the direct control of the national security state]{.underline}
(see, for example, Brians 2006; Evans 1998; Sontag 1966). In other
words, [we live today in the world made by the Cold War, a global
project that engineered everyday life---indeed, life itself---around the
technological means of apoc- alyptic destruction]{.underline} (see Masco
2006).

imperialistic' nature. This Cold War residue even made the
categorization and scope of the conflicts themselves a source of
political discord: in the West, Chechnya often became 'Southern Russia,'
South Ossetia became 'Georgia,' and Crimea has now become 'Ukraine.' In
other words, time and again Russia preferred keeping situations more
case-specific and minimalized, while the United States]{.underline} (in
Russia's opinion at least) [effectively re-characterized the situations
so that they seemed more far reaching and tyrannical in terms of danger
and concern]{.underline}. No doubt even more galling to Russia has been
the need to answer such criticism [while the United States has pursued
decidedly more aggressive maneuvers on a global scale without
interference and relatively minor criticism. Russia did not interfere
when campaigns were launched in Afghanistan and Iraq. Russia did not
interfere with maneuvers in Libya and Yemen. What Russia bristles at is
when America characterizes its own maneuvers as somehow being something
'above' basic foreign policy priorities and national security objectives
while everything the Russian Federation does in much the same light is
declared 'neo-imperialist' or breaking international law.]{.underline}
Make note: this is not any lame or manic anti American diatribe. Russia
is not anti-American. Russia is simply first and foremost pro-Russia,
just as it expects and assumes America to be first and foremost
pro-America. And here is the tricky part: on this issue, in the eyes of
most of the world when speaking privately, Russia is right. [America is
the only country that indefatigably explains its positions as being
about something more than just purely American interests.]{.underline}
But the U.S. needs to understand that this sermon is being delivered
from a pulpit more and more often to an EMPTY congregation: no one
except America believes this diplomatic propaganda. [Surveying allies
and adversaries alike reveals nothing but dismissive smirks about the
idea that American global maneuvers are based on higher moral principles
rather than on what best positions American national
interests]{.underline}. Again, remember the subtlety: [such
dismissiveness is not anger about America trying to leverage its power
for maximum output. It is rather irritation at how often America tries
to judge and prevent other states from doing the exact same thing on the
regional and/or global stage.]{.underline} Other countries might not
like how Russia expresses its power but they accept those maneuvers, for
better or worse, as the way [the geopolitical game still works on the
modern global stage of differentiated power capacity.]{.underline} As
long as [the United States continues to delude itself on this basic
fundamental aspect of global affairs - envisioning itself as the great
preserver of international principles while never supposedly acting
opportunistically or self-servingly - then it will continue to blow a
mighty wind on situations like Crimea while accomplishing nothing.
Indeed, Russians have complained about the essence of this American
diplomatic grandstanding for decades, in earnest since 9/11 when they
believed America would be joining them in the global fight against
radical Islamic extremism only to be inexplicably]{.underline} (to them)
[rebuffed.]{.underline} [America has long held pride in the fact that it
can and does project its global power independently when it wants to. It
has never, however, responded positively whenever any other nation tries
to do the same, whether it is Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, or
Russia. And for those who think it is alright to 'constrain' such
nations, keep in mind that France, Germany, Israel, and India have all
complained at times of the same thing]{.underline}. There is nothing
wrong with trying to 'manage your power brand' so that it comes across
as something more noble and more righteous than pure nationalist desire.
When the United States seems to actually come across as [complaining
about other countries not buying in and wanting the same right to enact
its political will just like America, then it underserves its own true
global power by seeming a bit petulant and unsubtle. And doing that,
unfortunately, is why Russia has been so successful in maintaining
geopolitical sympathizers outside of Western Europe when it comes to
American posturing. It makes the U.S. look like it is trying to bring a
knife to a foreign policy gunfight.]{.underline}

### Link -- Russia Politics 

#### Their descriptions of Russian domestic unrest stems from a narcissistic cold war ideology that makes relations impossible 

**Crosston '15** (Matthew, Professor of Political Science at Bellevue

Pathologies", Forthcoming in Сравнительная Политика, No. 3 (19), 2015,
МГИМО (Московский Государственный Институт Международного Отношения),
Moscow, Russian Federation, pgs. 11-15)

There is no stronger example of the schizophrenic nature of American
foreign policy toward Russia than comparing statements written in the
formal National Security Strategy (NSS) of President Obama with actual
testimony given by the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.
[In 2010 the NSS asserted that the U.S. would endeavor to 'build a
stable, substantive, multidimensional relationship with Russia, based on
mutual interests.']{.underline} What's more, the NSS called Russia a
21st century center of influence in the world and a country with whom
America should build bilateral cooperation on a host of issues,
[including forging global nonproliferation; confronting violent
extremism; fostering new trade and development arrangements; promoting
the rule of law, accountability in government and universal values in
Russia; and in cooperating as a partner in Europe and
Asia.]{.underline}15 Now take into account [Director James Clapper while
appearing before Congress in 2013 to discuss global
threats]{.underline}. He [described Russian foreign policy as a nexus of
organized crime, state policy, and business interests (let it be noted
that all three of these descriptors were said
pejoratively)]{.underline}.16 [Clapper went on to warn that both China
and Russia represented the most persistent intelligence threats to the
United States and that Russia could even face social
discontent]{.underline} (read: political disorder and revolution)
[because of a sluggish economy, the constraint of political pluralism,
and pervasive corruption]{.underline}.17 [At first blush these two
accounts seem to offer a completely incompatible attitude toward Russia.
Reading deeper between the lines of the NSS reveals key words, however,
that always trigger contempt from Russian actors in the Kremlin. The
ideal of 'promoting rule of law, government accountability and universal
values' is not an olive branch offering Russia the chance to team up
with America. This ideal is not being promoted with Russia but in
Russia.]{.underline} To follow that goal up with being a 'cooperative
partner' in Europe and Asia has also always signaled to Russian ears an
American skepticism about Russia's ability to be a 'non-meddler'[. In
other words, the NSS comes across to Russians not as a mechanism to
promote deeper co-equal ties between the two countries but rather as a
snobbish slap across the face about how the United States needs to
engage Russia to stop it from getting in its own and others'
way]{.underline}. Clapper's comments in some ways garner even more
derision from Moscow. Not so much the complaints about centralized power
and corruption. Russia has been hearing these criticisms since Yeltsin
first came down off the tanks after the August coup in 1991. Russia has
always been rather dismissive of these arguments. Rather, Clapper's
comments about the possibility of social discontent and unrest, placing
that possibility at the feet of the Russian government because of
repression and incompetence, always comes off as a red flag to the bull
of Russian conspiracy theorists: they are quick to see American
interference in any and all things that go wrong in Russia. And even if
the more rational voices in Russian political power dismiss conspiracy
theories, there is still the obvious interpretation that while America
might not try to personally foment unrest, Clapper's comments make it
seem like instability would be welcomed. The U.S. government at times
can play too fast and loose with semantics: as long as America does not
actively try to create discord it thinks it cannot possibly be seen as a
source of such discord. Very few actors around the globe agree with that
interpretation, especially Russians. [To this day Russians point to
Georgia, to Ukraine, to the countries of the Arab Spring, to Syria, and
believe the build-up to the unrest was either directly orchestrated by
the United States or at least subtly fostered by America. To Russians
there is no difference between 'actively pursuing' and 'subtly managing'
while to Americans they are complete polar opposites. This is what
allows Russia to take statements about bilateral cooperation and
substantive partnership and see nothing but animosity, mistrust, and
manipulation.]{.underline} Indeed, it is surprising there is not more
analysis comparing the U.S. National Security Strategy with the
subsequent Russian foreign policy concept that came out in 2013 on the
heels of Clapper's testimony. It affirms the Putin criticism that
U.S.-Russia relations will always remain complicated because of
fundamental cultural differences. What might be these cultural
differences? Namely, that [American identity is based on individual
wants, racism, genocidal and other extreme forms of violence and thus
will always conflict with Russian identity, which is based on 'loftier
ambitions, more of a spiritual kind]{.underline}.'18 This was only
compounded on September 11th of the same year, when [Putin published a
letter to the New York Times: • The UN could collapse and international
law would suffer if nations take military action without UN approval. •
Such action in Syria would only result in a total destabilization of the
area and a widening of conflict and terrorism. • Russia is protecting,
therefore, international law rather than the Assad regime. • Many in the
world are beginning to see the United States as relying solely on brute
force and that such U.S. reliance has proven ineffective and pointless.
• President Obama's statement that the United States should act when
possible to uphold international norms was 'extremely dangerous,'
arguing that all countries are equal already under international
law]{.underline}.19 [This amounts to nothing more than
posturing]{.underline} presidencies and tit-for-tat foreign policy,
where each side envisions the other as the chief global antagonist while
promoting themselves as the cowboy in the white hat standing up for the
less powerful in the world. But it is important to note that Russia's
tit, as it were, came after America's tat. Rightly or wrongly, Russia is
convinced that America has a global agenda that pushes not only itself
as a single unilateral superpower but also pays special attention to
keeping Russia on the sidelines, politically and militarily
marginalized. What this de facto means for U.S-Russia relations is that
the highest office in both countries cannot actually be counted upon to
inspire new and better interaction and engagement. Rather, the
administrations of the two presidents seem rather intent and eager to
only make things worse. Given the aforementioned section showing how
media outlets and academic think tanks also tend to not improve the
situation, this leaves very little room for analysts to carve some
balance and fairness into the debate. Despite this problem, some are
indeed attempting to carve that space and deserve greater attention.

### Link -- Russia (Think Tanks)

#### Their use of think tanks as a way of predicting Russian behavior guarantees error replication 

**Crosston '15** (Matthew, Professor of Political Science at Bellevue
University, "NEMESIS: Keeping Russia an Enemy through Cold War
Pathologies", Forthcoming in Сравнительная Политика, No. 3 (19), 2015,
МГИМО (Московский Государственный Институт Международного Отношения),
Moscow, Russian Federation, pgs. 3-8)

[There are numerous think tanks]{.underline}, both in the United States
and Russia, [which are deeply concerned about the state of
Russian-American relations]{.underline}. Places like the Moscow Carnegie
Centre or [the Brookings Institute in Washington DC are regular go-to
places for the media when seeking expert opinion and analysis. However,
these centers have had a decided slant in allocating blame for the poor
bilateral relations to the Russians, with the explanations ranging from
the fairly simple to the rather mystically esoteric.]{.underline} "If
America did not exist, Russia would have to invent it. In a sense it
already has: first as a dream, then as a nightmare. No other country
looms so large in the Russian psyche. To Kremlin ideologists, the very
concept of Russia's sovereignty depends on being free of America's
influence. Anti-Americanism has long been a staple of Vladimir Putin,
but it has undergone an important shift. Gone are the days when the
Kremlin craved recognition and lashed out at the West for not
recognizing Russia as one of its own. Now it neither pretends nor
aspires to be like the West. Instead, it wants to exorcise all traces of
American influence."2 [It is not difficult to find this Freudian popcorn
political psychology today when it comes to 'analyzing' Russian
positions. It portrays the United States as the victim of a global
oedipal complex when it comes to Russia: first Putin desperately craves
daddy's attention only to then defiantly and recklessly reject him,
petulantly trying to run away from home.]{.underline} It is important to
remark how most countries around the world would actually find it
dangerously myopic and unhealthy to base its own foreign policy on
earning the 'approval' of another country. With ease the far more
standard approach to foreign policy formulation is to determine a
country's own national interests within its local security dilemma and
craft an independent and fierce strategy that can best achieve its
optimal goals. That normal process, ironically, is often described in
America as a 'shift' away from craving attention to exorcising American
demons. In reality there is no shift: Russia has always been about
Russia, as it expects America to be about America, France to be about
France, Nigeria to be about Nigeria, so forth and so on. [What Russia
usually finds so irksome is that when it does what everyone else does in
terms of exercising global power, it is judged as psychologically
unstable or deficient. What the American media outlets and think tank
personalities fail to recognize is how much of this judgment is coming
not from explicitly observable behavior or direct quotes from Russian
actors but is placed upon Russia by the so called experts themselves as
they push a decidedly one-sided interpretation.]{.underline} Russia is
not supposed to aspire to be a copy of the West nor should it be
allowing particular American influence over its policies. This is not
said as anti-Americanism but rather as simple logic: America would never
strive to copy another country and it most certainly would not allow
another country to force-influence its foreign policy. So why should
Russia? It is this very simple and straightforward question that seems
to never be asked by what are otherwise august media institutions and
impressive political think tanks in the West. Sometimes this tendency
can reach near farcical levels. When Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the
Russian parliament's foreign-relations committee, received so much media
attention here when he spoke about ridding Russia of dependence on
America and even fining cinemas that showed too many foreign films,
Western experts needed to recognize the absurd for absurdity. But they
did not. Failure to do so is perplexing given Western analysis always
laments the strengthening of Putin's own presidential power system and
decries how little power sits within the legislative or judiciary
branches of Russian government. Thus, it is nonsensical to highlight
parliamentarians as having real impact. But this happens often in
America with no sense of diplomatic irony. There also tends to be a
failure to focus Russian analysis through the looking glass of
reciprocity. What this means is that [current American thinking
emphasizes how untrustworthy Moscow decision-makers are while completely
ignoring the same Russian criticism lobbed back at
Washington.]{.underline} President Putin openly and publicly discusses
his lack of trust in American power and in the specific policy decisions
emanating from the White House. It is this skepticism that supposedly
forces his own lack of desire to engage the United States. There are
simply too few voices at present in the West trying to analyze this
mindset as a legitimate position. As far as can be determined, the only
reason this is not analyzed more seriously is because the competing
alternative -- that Putin is untrustworthy and Moscow is the cause of
all communication breakdown -- is simply accepted as a de facto axiom.
[In short, if the United States does not trust Russia, it is because of
how Russia behaves on the global stage and its untrustworthy history. If
Russia does not trust the United States, that is simply Russian
posturing and a case of political transference, wanting to blame its own
selfmade problems on someone else so that it can avoid any
accountability. The problem is how readily this is unquestioningly
accepted]{.underline} and how few so-called Russian experts are willing
to step forward and shine a light on such intellectual superficiality.
[Perhaps one of the worst examples of this is the over-reliance on
'insider knowledge' without actually vetting the source's
objectivity.]{.underline} The recent exit of Alexander Sytnik as a
senior fellow from the Russian Institute for Strategic Research is a
prime example. Upon his exit early in 2015, Reshetnikov unleashed a
torrent of information that, while interesting, really does not amount
to more than just gossip and hearsay. Worse, American media and
political analysts adopted it almost wholly as fact rather than as a
possibly compromised source motivated to talk badly about Russia: "The
Russian analyst's scathing remarks about the country's leadership and
about the community of government experts confirm that the concept of
Russian supremacy has a strong hold on the Russian leadership. These
supremacist views are not limited to the post-Soviet space, where 'only
ethnic Russians are capable of creating statehood.' The West is also
seen as decadent and somewhat spiritually inferior to the Russians. The
spread of such views in Russia, especially among the country's leaders,
precludes easy and quick solutions to the Ukrainian crisis, but rather
suggests a relatively lengthy period of tensions between Russia and the
West, even if Russian strongman Vladimir Putin were, for some reason, to
step down."3 (Italics mine) [The tendency is to use personal opinion as
confirmation of fact when it should be recognized as biased material.
The only confirmation is the affirming of preconceived ideas and a
particular agenda that undermines any new attitudinal environment
between Russia and the United States. As a consequence, it is easy to
find 'research' proclaiming Russian goals that have never been publicly
disclosed or addressing Putin objectives that have never been formally
issued. This is not to say that Russia is incapable of having ulterior
motives or secret agendas.]{.underline} Truly every country to one
degree or another has them. The criticism here is the propensity in the
Russian analytical sphere to assume such agendas and then cherry picking
information to affirm the assumption. In [pure methodological terms,
selection bias is rife within the community that analyzes Russia,
leaving those analyses decidedly weak. This bias is only more pronounced
when you leave academically-oriented think tanks/news monitors behind
and observe within the corridors of American power]{.underline}.
Traditionally, the focus has been on a decidedly anti-Russian fervor
coming from the Republican Party. However, this analysis would argue
that except for a very brief and ultimately dashed Obama 'reset,'
Russian-American relations within Washington DC has always been
dominated in both parties by a remarkably typical Republican mindset.
[That mindset sets a fairly stark characterization: Russia is an
aggressive and untrustworthy dictatorship that is an innate
contradiction to American values. As such it will inevitably always be a
threat to U.S. interests and global security]{.underline}. 4 By all
indicators, Russia is a threat not just to itself and its immediate
neighbors but to the entire world, masking its own domestic failings and
instabilities with an aggressive foreign policy that will never
acquiesce to a more peaceful and cooperative global community.5 [Indeed,
in an American political world that likes to specialize in ambiguous
statements and plausible deniability, it is rather remarkable how freely
the American Congress seems to deride Russia: John Boehner: "It is
increasingly evident that Russia is intent on expanding its boundaries
and power through hostile acts." Ted Poe: "The Russian bear is coming
out of its cave because it got its feelings hurt because of the fall of
the Soviet Union, and now it is trying to regain its
territories."]{.underline} Chris Smith: accused a "repressive Russian
regime" of "coddling dictators" around the globe from Central Asia to
Syria to Cuba and Venezuela. Trent Franks: After the conclusion of an
arms deal between Russia and Venezuela, President Putin was called a
"thugocrat" engaged in "dangerous alliances."6 [Keep in mind all of the
above statements were uttered before the 2014 crisis in Ukraine even
broke out. So before the U.S. Congress received what is has subsequently
considered undeniable and irrefutable proof of Russian aggression in
Ukraine, it was already quite prepared to view Russia solely as a
corrupt kleptocracy willfully abusing human rights, powered by an
irrational and paranoid hatred of the United States as the sole driver
of its foreign policy.]{.underline}

### Link -- Somali Instability 

#### Descriptions of Somalia as a rogue insecure state contribute to violent forms of international governance and disavows ongoing local movements against the liberal order. This demonstrates the essentialist elitism that their knowledge production relies on.

**Richmond '15** (Oliver, International Relations prof at University of
Manchester, "Decolonizing security and peace: Mono-epistemology versus
peace formation", Conflict Resolution and Ontological Security: Peace
Anxieties, Routledge, 2015)

[In Somalia, long considered in western circles as the most anarchic of
places, local clan governance has emerged through local organizations
where the state and international actors are absent. Internationals see
Somalia as subject to most levels of insecurity, and in particular as a
threat to the liberal peace ontology.]{.underline} In one of the longest
running failed states [in modern history, informal systems for security,
governance, law, economic support and even representation have emerged
through networks of civil, customary, and business actors in an
'informal mosaic' which is forming a new, localized, peace in each
instance]{.underline} (Menkhaus 2006). Menkhaus (2006, p.87) [has
described this as a 'radical localization' of politics via 'informal,
overlapping polities loosely held by clan leaders and others' also
including elders, the business community, and clergy forming tense
coalitions over power, resources, as well as judicial and law
enforcement matters]{.underline}. Indeed, [neither internationals nor
the centralized state have provided peace, but local peace formation
actors have been more successful in their own way. Customary systems
there have been instrumental in both war and peace, and equally vital to
both]{.underline}. Indeed, Menkhaus goes as far as to argue that the
international system itself is mirrored by the complex system of blood
payments, customary law, negotiation, and force. [Such processes have
also actively worked to undermine the revival of a centralized state,
because the state itself is viewed as a potential threat to peace. In
turn the vestiges of state still functioning often seek to marginalize
the threat of local peace formers to its remaining power]{.underline}
(Menkhaus 2006, p.76). Often, detailed, formal agreements are made and
mediated between customary elders and district or state officials (as in
Ethiopia) (Hagmann 2007, pp.6, 18). Where the state has been absent this
peace formation role has been the only possibility (Hagmann 2007, p.9).
It has provided some level of social and material security, a rule of
law, a customary order, supported by elders, society, the business
community, and even militias, as also in Puntland and most obviously in
Somaliland. This has arisen through the Guurti (an upper parliamentary
house), a legislative and cultural link between traditional, informal
and modern, formal governance without which there would be no rule of
law or social order. It bridges and negotiates in order to maintain
peace (Richards 2012, p. 154--155). This has rested on hybrid forms of
governance, incorporating aspects of the modern state with informal,
local, historical processes in Somaliland. Menkhaus (2006, p.82)
describes this as 'without government, but not without governance'. What
this suggests is that [physical insecurity is not necessary matched by
existential security, even where a peace process or the institutions of
state are coming into being. The northern assumption that the state is a
vital vehicle for peace does not hold in this case either, suggesting
significant epistemological disagreement. Local peace formation
processes across the region, of course, small scale and little able to
deal with direct violence, are actually ontologically secure in their
understanding of how peace may be made, and with what
outcome.]{.underline} They are also unanimous that a centralized state
is a threat to both ontological security and their epistemic framework
of peace. Neither has the liberal peace made a great impression, or has
much in the way of a hybrid peace or state emerged as yet (despite very
significant structural and governmental power lying in the hands of
internationals and donors). [Radically different ontologies of security
for self and others exist in this case at local, state, and
international levels. Homogenization, standardization, liberalization,
westernization and other familiar motifs of peace and conflict
resolution and their claims to produce ontological security through
universalism have not impressed and been ignored. Such patterns of
subaltern agency with respect to peace-making are common, though they
often differ in their approach to building a state and a liberal peace
or rejecting them]{.underline}. Even if such processes are not made
public or formal they often continue informally or as NGOs that do not
want to become part of the state infrastructure though they are crucial
to the debate on peace locally and at the national level (this is the
case with the National Peace Council in Sri Lanka) (Perera 2012). In
South Africa a peace architecture emerged at grassroots level as the
apartheid system was being dismantled and a liberal state was being
built. Many others have since followed, including Ghana, Kenya, South
Sudan, Togo, and Timor-Leste, often assisted by UNDP support and
community forums, women's groups, track II processes, and mediators.

### Link -- South Korea Alliance

#### The appeal to the status of Middle Power serves to invoke South Korea as a model of statecraft, in which the colonized nation enters the status of Great Power. This upholds a code of hierarchy that creates the conditions for endless intervention

**Hughes '12** (Theodore, KOREA FOUNDATION ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF KOREAN
STUDIES IN THE HUMANITIES AT COLOMBIA UNIVERSITY, "DEVELOPMENT AS
DEVOLUTION: Overcoming Communism and the "Land of Excrement" Incident",
from the book "Literature and Film in Cold War South Korea: Freedom\'s
Frontier", Colombia University Press)

[For the past ten years, **South Korea has been invoked as a privileged
example of developmental success, a model-become-reality for Iraq,
Afghanistan, and,** eventually, other sites in **the Middle East**. A
multilayered forgetting enables this instance of
exemplarity]{.underline}. Recall that for Timothy Mitchell [the
"world-as-picture" stages a colonial European modernity marked by a
"double claim": that the model or project is always a mere copy, that
the world it replicates "must be, by contrast, original . . . in a word
(what we imagine as) real.]{.underline}" For Mitchell, as we saw
earlier, "[the effectiveness of this world-as-picture lies not simply in
the process of serialization. It lies in the apparent contrast created
between images, which are repeatable, serializable . . . and the
opposing effect of]{.underline} an original, of what appears to be the
actual nation, the people itself, [the real economy]{.underline}." 86
[Here, the site of the "original,"]{.underline} which Mitchell proceeds
to deconstruct, [is Europe.]{.underline} [The Cold War extends colonial
European modernity, but **with a modification of the picture linked to
responsibilization and** de jure **sovereignty. Replacing
Europe**]{.underline}, or what we might more accurately call the
Euro-American core, [as the "actual" **is a more flexible
hierarchization that allows for the advance of postcolonial nation-state
units in the evolutionist world system**---for example, by possible
inclusion in the OECD, the expanding G-series, etc. Serialization now
enters the picture in a different way. We encounter a serialized
modularity that continuously transforms "copy" into "original," "model"
into referent for the next project. In the end, we]{.underline} may
[witness the elimination of this transfer of model to referent
altogether (a transfer, or its promise, that is itself currently the
enactment of the global regime of responsibilization). **This staging**
would involve what Baudrillard]{.underline} long ago [**designated as**
the "**hyperreal" or**]{.underline}, put somewhat differently, **[the
seamless circulation of]{.underline}** Wiener's "[**pure information**."
We live]{.underline} in the interstices, [in a globalization marked by
desires both for the imagining of transferable reference and for the
cybertechnological doing away of reference altogether. The former, like
the nation-state, is still with us, if, in no other place, at least in
exemplarity or the imagining of the example]{.underline}. Nam's works
attempt to contest Park Chung Hee's articulation of statist,
ethnonational developmentalism, which is itself a continuation of and
reaction against the colonial past and U.S. metropolitan representations
of its free-world developmentalist mission. [To figure development as
devolution is to make visible the relation between Cold War
developmentalism and the history of Euro-American colonial racism that
informs it. Both developmentalism and colonial racism rely upon an
evolutionary narrative]{.underline}. Nam's attempt to interrupt the
developmentalist imagination involves a location of the "original" in
the immediacy of the ethnonationalized body, away from the exemplarity
of Euro-America. [**The** interrogation of the **developmentalist
fantasy** frame and its visual **hailing** of **free-world
subjects**]{.underline} in Nam's work [**underscores** the importance of
appropriations of]{.underline} Hollywood-style [backdrops, the imagining
of **the South Korean** present **landscape as having developed into a
U.S. background populated by South Korean protagonists**.]{.underline}
As noted above, such imaginings are easily found in 1950s and 1960s
popular culture. Kim Ki-do˘k's Yongary, Monster from the Deep (
Taegwoesu yonggari , 1967), for example, provides us with a remake of
Godzilla that turns upon the spectacle of an already developed Korea in
full possession of a space program---we are presented with cars, roads,
clothes, homes, and suburban spaces that seem very much in line with
what we might expect in 1960s Pasadena or Cape Canaveral. The film and
its 1967 audience enter into the space, in the movie theater, of the
future perfect of development---development as an already accomplished
fact and as yet to be achieved. Yongary , in fact, follows statist
anticommunism in its portrayal of the monster as something more than
degraded other. In a pivotal scene and in the midst of Yongary's rampage
through Seoul, the child protagonist dances with the monster to the tune
of a jazzed-up version of "Arirang." Indeed, Yongary and the boy have a
special relationship, informed by the trope of the organicist
nation---body (North Korea) has become separated from head, the boy
genius, product and future vanguard of the developmental South Korean
state. Body and mind, North and South Korea, unite momentarily and
spontaneously, to the rhythm of "Arirang," jazzifi ed, modernized, yet
ethnonational. I noted above the ways in which the resistance Nam mounts
to the Cold War order rearticulates the questioning of Western
exemplarity in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Certainly, Nam's
nationalism coincides, on multiple levels, with the masculinisms and
essentialisms informing both the Japanese imperialism of the past and
the U.S. neocolonialism of the present. [What is the relation between
the call to overcome modernity by the pre-1945 pan-Asian imperial
subject and the call to do the same by the post-1945 South Korean
ethnonational subject]{.underline}? In Nam's texts, as [in South Korean
postcolonial statist-nationalism, this relation makes itself visible in
a certain way: as what is to remain unseen and unspoken]{.underline}. In
the next chapter, we will look at the ways in which the writer Ch'oe
In-hun seeks to move beyond oppositions such as colonial/anticolonial,
nation/empire, East/West, and fi rst world/second world, which played
such a central role in organizing and disciplining Cold War subjects in
South Korea. The search for an alternative begins with the flight to a
"neutral country" in Ch'oe's 1960 The Square (published during the April
19--May 16 period) and comes to a certain end in his 1973 The Tempest ,
a much less well-known text that, like The Ugly American , locates a
noncapitalist fantasy frame in a fi ctional country in Southeast Asia.
As we will see, it was Ch'oe In-hun who fi rst addressed the ways in
which [the contemporary division system was bound up both with the
selective remembering of the colonial past in South Korea and the visual
regime making up the broader Cold War order.]{.underline}

### Link---Taiwan 

#### The 1ac's construction of Taiwan represents the conventional image of US geopolitical domination by using crisis management as a policy posture meant to bolster US national security and its containment policy on China. The discursive imagery of the 1ac is nothing more than western realism meant to maintain American supremacy.

The 'China Threat' Discourse and the New Containment Policy Insofar as
"saying is doing,"105 I want to suggest that the construction of the
'China threat' comes with a built-in, politico-strategic question with
'real-world' consequences---'What should we do about it?'106 In other
words, it is always a clarion call for the practice of power politics,
at t[he apex of which is to "maintain American supremacy]{.underline} in
political and economic terms around the globe."107 This, according to
Benjamin Schwarz: 104 Ibid., p. 103. 105 Nicholas G. Onuf,

155 means not only that [the United States must dominate wealthy and
technologically sophisticated states in Europe and East Asia---America's
"allies"---but also that it must deal with such nuisances]{.underline}
as Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic and Kim Jong Il, [so that
potential great powers need not acquire the means to deal with those
problems themselves.]{.underline} And those powers that eschew American
supervision---such as [China---must be both engaged and contained. The
upshot of "American leadership" is that the United States must spend
nearly as much on national security as the rest of the world
combined.108 At stake here are the vested interests of U.S. national
security agencies and their industrial contractors, for a 'China threat'
scenario would almost guarantee a surge of U.S. spending on
weapons]{.underline} and increased enthusiasm for the national missile
shield.109 In this context, therefore[, it is necessary to focus again
on how the creation of the Chinese Other in the 'China threat' argument
plays an important role in shaping the power relations between the West
(the United States in particular) and China, and how the containment
policy cannot be put into practice without a prior sanction of the
discursive imagery of China as a 'real' strategic threat]{.underline}.
In a short yet decisive article entitled "Why We Must Contain China,"
American columnist Charles Krauthammer takes "a rising and threatening
China" as his starting point of analysis. In consequence, he argues that
"[any rational policy toward" it must "have exactly these two
components": "containing China" and "undermining its ruthless
dictatorship." Indeed, by seeing China as a bully and the mother of all
other enemies]{.underline} (since "it is sending missile and nuclear
technology to such places as Pakistan and Iran"), he urges that this
containment policy "must begin early in its career," and be complemented
by a policy aimed at "undermining its aggressively dictatorial regime."
To further flesh out his containment strategy, Krauthammer offers such
practical options as strengthening regional alliances (with Vietnam,
India, Russia, as well as Japan) to box in China; standing by Chinese
dissidents; denying Beijing the right to host the Olympics; and keeping
China from joining the World Trade Organisation on the terms it
desires.110 Similar policy advice was also offered by an article
published in The Economist, which anchors its argument in an image of
China as "the real source of the current tension" in Asia.111 The only
important difference between the two articles is that the latter is more
frank about the underlying aim of the containment strategy, which is to
prolong U.S. military dominance in that region. It insists that
"South-East Asian 108 Benjamin Schwarz, "Permanent Interests, Endless
Threats: Cold War Continuities and NATO Enlargement," World Policy

countries should stop averting their eyes from reality and instead make
a more active effort to keep an American military presence in the
region. It is unlikely that China would have challenged the Philippines
over the rocky islet it claims in the South China Sea if the American
navy had still had its Philippine base."112 [Commenting on these efforts
to create and strengthen alliances to contain China,]{.underline} former
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger wrote: "continued rapprochement
with India and effervescent U.S.-Japan relations, both fully justified,
now are pursued with more than a whiff of Chinese encirclement."113
Certainly**[, the strategy derived from the 'China threat' argument is
not a monolithic whole of confrontational containment. More often than
not, there exists a subtle, business-style policy of 'crisis
management]{.underline}**.' For example, central to the concerns of
Gerald Segal and David S. G. Goodman in their edited volume China
Rising: Nationalism and Interdependence is how [to "constitute a policy
framework for managing a rising China]{.underline}." 114 Bernstein and
Munro also shy away from the word 'containment' and prefer to call their
China policy 'management,' that is, "**[how can the conflict with China
be managed]{.underline}**?"115 Nonetheless, **[what remains unchanged
here is a continued advocacy of controlling China.]{.underline}** A
perusal of Bernstein and Munro's texts reveals that what they mean by
'management' is almost identical to Krauthammer's explicit containment
stance.116 **[By framing U.S.-China relations as an issue of crisis
management, they leave little doubt of who is the 'manager,' who is to
be 'managed,' and where power and authority should lie]{.underline}**.
Indeed, for Betts and Christensen, coercion and war are part and parcel
of their China management policy: In addressing the China challenge,
[the United States needs to think]{.underline} hard about three related
questions: first, **[how to avoid crises and war through prudent,
coercive diplomacy; second, how to manage crises and fight a war if the
avoidance efforts fails; third, how to end crises and terminate war at
costs acceptable to the United States and its allies]{.underline}**.117

dissident groups, embarrassing China by lending sympathy to Taiwan and
Tibetan exile leaders, maintaining the American military presence in
Asia and keeping it vastly more powerful and effective than China's
military, strengthening Japan and the U.S.-Japanese alliance and, last
but not least, courting the younger, more modern generation in China.

Containment policy is as much about satisfying the Western goal of
absolute security as it is about deterring China. Thus, as Gerald Segal
makes clear, there is really no substitute for coercive containment,
since no alternative to it can meet the need to seek an absolute
security guarantee from China. No one, as he argues, can "count on
China's short-term economic need ensuring a peaceful partner in the 21st
century. Hence the question arises of the limit of the interdependence
strategy to restrain China \[emphasis added\]."118 [In order to "ensure
China's cooperation on matters of regional and international security
\[emphasis added\]]{.underline}," Segal insists that [aggressive
containment must be the order of the day]{.underline}: [If]{.underline}
Hong Kong and southern China's [economies have to be damaged in order to
modify Chinese policies on arms sales or human rights]{.underline}, then
so be it. If industries in Shanghai or some other regions have to be
targeted in order to induce regional leaders to press Beijing on foreign
policy disputes, then so be it. Foreigners will have an increasing stake
in the conclusion that, if Beijing is to remain in the middle of its
kingdom, it will have to be a looser kingdom.119 While seeing the need
for containment,120 Huntington signifies that there still exist other
options to ease the threat, such as the democratisation of China. And to
this end, Huntington virtually comes up with a strategy of
Christianising Chinese leaders. He believes that China's Confucian
heritage, an obstacle to democracy, can be overcome by Christianity, as
in the case of Korea and Taiwan, where "the political leaders most
active in pushing for democracy were Christians."121 For all its
contemporary 'political science' guise, this is reminiscent of a
19th-century missionary conviction that in order for China to be
democratised, it must be Christianised first. [Of course, not all these
strategies will be automatically translated into actual policy and
practice. But more often than not they do make their way into bilateral
relations]{.underline}. For example, alarmed by the 1999 Cox Report of
China's nuclear espionage, the powerful U.S. Senator (now retired) Jesse
Helms was determined to press Washington to do something about it. Among
his key recommendations were to "shore up our own defenses, and those of
our allies... bring Taiwan under a regional missile- 118 Gerald Segal,
"China's Changing Shape," Foreign Affairs 73, no. 3 (1994), p. 55. 119
Ibid., p. 58. 120 For example, Huntington writes that "If the United
States does want to stop Chinese domination of East Asia, it will need
to redirect the Japanese alliance to that purpose, develop close
military ties with other Asian nations, and enhance its military
presence in Asia and the military power it can bring to bear in Asia."

158 defense umbrella," and "build a national missile defense," including
scrapping the Anti- Ballistic Missile Treaty.122 As we now know, almost
all these measures have become part of American foreign policy. In this
context, I argue that it is imperative to ask the question of "What are
the implications of this kind of policy on China?" In a recent article
critical of the containment policy, Joshua Cooper Ramo has specifically
pointed out some of its dire implications for China. As he notes: [If
you do happen to fall into the camp of people who would like to contain
or constrain China, you should be clear that the ultimate impact of that
policy, if it succeeds, will be to condemn hundreds of millions of
people and perhaps more, to lives of poverty and perhaps
chaos]{.underline}. [Effectively "isolating" China or treating it as
"threat" as some offensive- realist policy makers suggest, would have
huge human consequences]{.underline}. Choking off growth in the PRC
could lead to instability and chaos. China's history is a fragile one
and though growth in China at the moment is robust, a real effort to
topple China into chaos would probably succeed. So policy makers who
argue for containment, as Paul Wolfowitz did in 1997, should be direct
about what they are really arguing for: the collapse of China.123 The
ensuing questions are of course "Will China readily accept such an
outcome?" and if not, "What are the implications for its relations with
the countries which seek to contain it?" These are the questions that I
will try to answer in the remaining parts of this chapter, which will
centre specifically on two recent incidents in the course of the new
U.S. pursuit of containing the 'China threat': firstly the Taiwan
Missile Crisis of 1995-1996 and then the Spy Plane incident of 2001.
'Threat' Theory as Practice (I): China and the Taiwan Missile Crisis
(1995-1996) In the eyes of many Western foreign policy analysts, China's
approach to Taiwan is nothing less than a microcosm of China's grand
strategy to dominate Asia. The consensus is that should one continue to
harbour any illusion about Beijing's threatening ambition, the
sabre-rattling missile exercises near Taiwan's coast in 1995- 1996
should be a wake-up call.124 122 Jesse Helms, "'Engagement' with China

of (Neo)Realist Framings of Contemporary China 159 While the 1995-1996
missile crisis has been a favourite 'starting point' to paint an image
of the China threat and to justify a firm Western response to it, the
question of how the situation reached its boiling point is often
conveniently ignored. But it is precisely in this process that [the
mutually reinforcing relationship between the 'China threat' image and
Western containment can be laid bare]{.underline}. As noted in the
previous chapter, with the outbreak of the Korean War, the fear of a
'Red Menace' crossing the frontier prompted the U.S. to deploy its
Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait in order to thwart what it saw as an
orchestrated Communist offensive in Asia. [This move cemented the
separation between Taiwan and the mainland, and it was not until the
establishment of full diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. in
January 1979 that the military tension in the Taiwan Strait began to
ease.]{.underline} Meanwhile, China's economic reform and opening up to
the outside world encouraged a sustained increase in economic, cultural,
and political contacts across the Taiwan Strait. Yet, **[despite these
new developments, the conventional Western image of the 'China threat'
lingered on, and was the rationale behind the passing of the Taiwan
Relations Act by Congress shortly after the normalisation of Sino-U.S.
relations.]{.underline}**125 [To manage such a 'threat]{.underline},'
the Act emphasised (and continues to emphasise) [renewed U.S. commitment
to Taiwan's security even though their diplomatic ties were
severed]{.underline}. Since Taiwan's first direct presidential election
in 1996, the 'China threat' argument, drawing explicitly on 'democratic
peace' theory, has taken on a new dimension: an increasingly assertive
China bullying a now democratised Taiwan. This highly charged,
dichotomised interpretation of the Taiwan question bears significant
strategic implications. "Do you believe a vibrant democracy of about 20
million people on large island off the coast of Asia is worth
defending?" asked an Australian policy analyst. Expecting no other
possible answer, he went on: "Good, then you accept that defence of
Taiwan against Chinese aggression is a worthy cause...."126 In a similar
fashion, The Economist argues that "the best policy is gradually to
expand ties with Force, 1950-96, Taiwan," International Security 26, no.

Christensen, "The Contemporary Security Dilemma: Deterring a Taiwan

Taiwan Relations Act considers "any effort to determine the future of
Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes,
a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of
grave concern to the United States."

already doing."127 **[In this context, despite a promise in a 1982 joint
communiqué with China to reduce its arms sales to Taiwan, America's arms
sales, whose accumulated value since 1992 has reached more than US\$20
billion, has continued unabated. Thus understood, Western realist
research findings and policy postures are from the outset part of the
'China threat' problem. That is, they serve to theoretically legitimate
continued arms sales to Taiwan, which in turn helps not only to bolster
Taiwan's defence capabilities, but also to induce some of its leaders'
independent ambitions]{.underline}**. This is evident, for example, in
both President Lee Teng-hui's high-profile visit to the U.S. in June
1995 and his inflammatory 'two-state' theory on cross-strait relations.
As Chalmers Johnson argues, "Lee was almost surely responding to
continuous signals he had been receiving from Republican leaders in
Washington that they would welcome a confrontation with China and want
to see Taiwan take this extremely provocative step." 128 Also, former
U.S. defence official Chas Freeman remarked that "**[U.S. arms sales to
Taiwan no longer work to boost Taipei's confidence that it can work out
its differences with Beijing]{.underline}**. Instead, they bolster the
view that Taiwan can go its own way."129 This, predictably, reinforces
Beijing's suspicion of the U.S.'s ambition in the region, frustrated its
reunification goal, and prompted it to prepare militarily for what it
fears as a worst-case scenario. This was the context of the 1995-1996
Taiwan Strait missile crisis. [In a bid to hamper Taiwan's independence
move, in the summer of 1995]{.underline} and again during Lee's
re-election campaign in March 1996, **[Beijing launched military
exercises, including missile tests, near the Taiwan Strait. For most
Chinese, the carrying out of military exercises, well within their own
territory, had little to do with attacking Taiwan, much less with
challenging America's security interests in the Western
Pacific]{.underline}**. Rather, it was more about China's long-cherished
dream of national unity, with its 'sabre-rattling' tactics serving as a
display of determination to carry out its reunification policy. However,
interpreting such exercises as China's muscle-flexing with direct
security implications for the region, with "an almost 19th-century
display of gunboat diplomacy,"130 the United States dispatched two
nuclear-powered aircraft-carrier battle 127 The Economist, "Containing

waters near the Taiwan Strait, its biggest military deployment in the
region since the Vietnam War. Without denying the enormous security
repercussions of these missile tests, I suggest that **[the 'China
threat' argument prevents the U.S. from recognising its own role in the
lead up to this crisis]{.underline}**. If the flashpoint of Taiwan does
spill over into regional conflict, it may say as much about the danger
of the dominant Western perspective on the Taiwan question as about the
threat of China's display of force itself. If such a danger was still
somehow obscured in the missile crisis, it was to be manifested in
another standoff in Sino-U.S. relations, namely, the spy plane incident
of 2001.

#### The aff's approach to Taiwanese conflict is structured by normative understandings of sovereignty that make war inevitable

Westphalian Sovereignty, Zero-sum Games, and the Taiwan [Conflict If the
Chinese mainland and Taiwan share the common normative ground of
Westphalian sovereignty, the ensuing question is: How does this
normative convergence contribute to the intractability of the Taiwan
issue?]{.underline} Conventional wisdom has it that conflict arises from
difference, while cooperation rests on convergence, as "democratic
peace" theory would have us believe. But this is true only to a certain
point. Very often, commonality as well as difference is at the core of
social conflict. For instance, a fundamental aspect of the conflict
between Christianity and Islam could be traced back to their
commonly-held monotheism as well as their myriad differences. Indeed, it
is not despite, but because of, their shared belief in the existence of
only one God that their clash has been so irreconcilable. Similarly, it
may be argued that many European conflicts in the colonial era were
animated as much by their shared belief in social Darwinism as by their
differing colonial interests. Thus Otto Klineberg observes that "the
opinions and attitudes of two contending sides may be mirror images of
each other" (\[54\], 94). Ashis Nandy \[55\] calls this phenomenon "the
intimate enemy," whereas Raymond Aron refers to it as "the enemy
partners."5 This may sound odd, but that is because, as Charles Taylor
points out, people have conflated common meaning with consensus. While
the latter is conducive to cooperation, the former is not necessarily
the case. As Taylor (\[56\], 39) explains: We could\... say that common
meanings are quite other than consensus, for they can subsist with a
high degree of cleavage; this is what happens when a common meaning
comes to be lived and understood differently by different groups in a
society. It remains a common meaning, because there is the reference
point which is the common purpose, aspiration, celebration\.... But this
common meaning is differently articulated by different groups. This is
the basis of the bitterest fights in a society\.... Perhaps one might
say that a common meaning is very often the cause of the most bitter
lack of consensus. [In cross-strait relations, Westphalian sovereignty
is precisely such a "common meaning," which can similarly explain the
very lack of consensus between Beijing and Taipei]{.underline}. It is in
this sense that I argue that [the link between Westphalian sovereignty
and conflict needs to be more fully understood]{.underline}. As many
scholars have noted, sovereign states and war often go hand in hand. For
Charles Tilly, "war made the state and the state made war" (\[30\], 42).
In a similar vein, [Michael Howard argues that "no Nation, in the true
sense of the word, could be born without war"]{.underline} (\[57\], 102,
emphasis in original). By "the true sense of the word," there is [little
doubt that Howard means the Westphalian sovereign state.]{.underline}
The irony here is that **[while the Westphalian state is defined by its
ability to monopolize the legitimate use of violence, the process in
which to acquire that monopoly is frequently fraught with
violence]{.underline}** (\[58\], 59). Admittedly, the Westphalian model
of sovereignty is not meant to incite war or violence. Quite the
opposite, Bodin's idea of sovereignty was designed to find a cure to the
scourge of religious conflict that had ravaged France at the time. For
Thomas Hobbes, the main political purpose of the sovereign state (the
Leviathan) was to maintain internal order. Similarly, **[through a clear
demarcation of sovereignty on the basis of territory and the reciprocal
recognition of sovereignty]{.underline}**, the Treaty of Westphalia was
aimed primarily to settle Europe's prolonged religious disputes. That
said, [while Westphalia helps regulate violence by restricting the
monopoly of violence and war-making to territorial states
only,]{.underline} it does not quite succeed in stopping war or violence
per se. As Susan Strange observed, internally [it "did nothing to stop
conflicts over the major sources of revenue and wealth for the
state]{.underline}" (\[59\], 347). Indeed, in his study of the
relationship between identity and violence in Bosnia, David Campbell
goes so far as to argue that [the conventional understanding of
sovereignty and territorial identity was largely responsible for both
ethnic cleansing and slow international intervention]{.underline} in the
Balkans \[60\]. **[Even as the sovereign state manages to establish
order domestically, it can be argued that human violence is merely
displaced "from within the territory of the state into the realm of
interstate relations]{.underline}**" (\[61\], 440). The reason why
Westphalian sovereignty is intimately linked to conflict is
straightforward. To begin with, Westphalian sovereignty, understood as
final authority, does not allow for compromise where sovereignty is
believed to be at stake. **[A struggle for final authority is by
definition a mutually exclusive, zero-sum game.]{.underline}** Hobbes
observes that "If any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless
they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" (\[62\], 184). [Thanks to
the diffusion of the Westphalian norm, sovereign authority is precisely
such a commonly desired thing and cannot be jointly
enjoyed]{.underline}. As such, its exclusive ownership often needs to be
settled by "the victory of one side over the other, a victory that makes
the one sovereign and the other subject" (\[1\], 98). [In international
relations, there are numerous examples of this type of zero-sum struggle
for sovereignty]{.underline}. **[Take the conflict between Israel and
the Palestinians for instance, the indivisible characteristic of
sovereignty]{.underline}** was likened by a former Tel Aviv lawyer to a
"woman," who cannot be shared (\[63\], 66). This analogy, while rather
crude, does strike at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian problem, a
problem which, according to Anthony Burke, has much to do with "the
[conceptual foundations Israel shares with other states---with the
modern \[Westphalian\] ontology of the secure nation-state]{.underline}"
(\[63\], 70--1). [Such a zero-sum struggle for exclusive sovereignty is
also manifested in the contentious and potentially explosive Taiwan
issue.]{.underline} During much of the Cold War period, the two sides,
informed by the Westphalian idea of exclusive sovereign authority,
pretended that the other did not even exist as a political entity, let
alone as an equal. [The KMT government in Taiwan viewed the People's
Republic as a bunch of "Communist bandits" (gongfei) and pursued a
policy of "three no's" vis-à-vis the mainland: no official contacts, no
negotiations, and no compromise]{.underline}. Likewise, Beijing regarded
Taiwan as little more than a "renegade province." In the fight over the
seat in the United Nations in the early 1970s, mainland China insisted
that it would not join unless Taipei was expelled (Taipei buchu, Beijing
buru). [The Taiwan authorities, after losing the UN votes, decided to
withdraw from the UN rather than accepting a proposal of dual
representation, on the ground that "There is no room for patriots and
traitors to live together" (]{.underline}Han zei bu liangli) (\[81\],
108). With final authority believed to be at stake, compromise has thus
been routinely ruled out by both sides as a sign of weakness or even
surrender. In a 1997 interview with Asian Affairs, then Chinese
President Jiang Zemin made this point clear: "You have here a case where
the fundamental interests of a nation lie. [On such a question involving
state sovereignty, a government has no room for any
compromise]{.underline}" \[64\]. **[Echoing this stance, a group of
scholars at an influential think tank in Beijing argued that "we are not
willing to see the loss of the principle of single sovereignty---the
inseparability of sovereignty.... If any compromises are made with
regard to Taiwan, they will not be made over the question of sovereignty
and the one China principle, which is the key to the
problem]{.underline}**" (\[38\], 134). Likewise, in reference to
Beijing's "one country, two systems" proposal, [the Taiwan authorities
made an uncompromising, mirror-image response: "the purpose of 'one
country, two systems' is to demand the ROC's complete surrender to the
Chinese Communists....]{.underline} Therefore, this piece of proposal
from the Chinese Communists is in fact impractical in the objective
sense, and absolutely unacceptable to us in the subjective sense"
\[65\]. [Thus, this unwillingness to make compromise, which in large
degree accounts for the Taiwan impasse, is clearly derived from the
Westphalian notion of exclusionary sovereignty]{.underline}. **[Second,
also complicating this zero-sum standoff is the aforementioned
Westphalian nexus between sovereignty and territory.]{.underline}** [If
the struggle over sovereignty already precludes compromise]{.underline},
then the [Westphalian territorialization of sovereignty
makes]{.underline} such a struggle even more diametrically Manichaean:
**[either a state possesses sovereignty over a particular piece of
territory, or it doesn't]{.underline}** (\[61\], 439). Just as **[there
is no room for compromise over final authority]{.underline}**, so
**[there is no space for territorial ambiguity]{.underline}**;
**[sovereignty]{.underline}**, in the Westphalian sense of the word, has
to be **[clearly demarcated along a geographical boundary that separates
"self" from "Other]{.underline}**." This helps us understand not only
why **[territorial integrity has been at the core of the "one China"
principle, but also why, despite ever-increasing economic links,
solutions to many territorial disputes in Asia still remain
elusive]{.underline}** (\[16\], 121). Third, given that the Westphalian
ideal entails the convergence between the state and the nation, not only
is the struggle over sovereignty concerned with territory, but it is
also about national identity. As noted before, [a central part of the
modern narrative of state sovereignty has been about popular
sovereignty, in which final authority is allegedly invested with the
nation]{.underline}. To the extent that Westp**[halian sovereignty
implies that the nation's identity and survival hinges on territorial
sovereignty, a struggle for the latter then becomes a matter of life and
death for the former]{.underline}**. As the argument goes, if "A
stateless person in the statecentric world is a nonperson" (\[66\],
245). then [a stateless nation in the Westphalian state system would be
no nation at all.]{.underline} **[To compromise on sovereignty and
territorial integrity thus amounts to nothing short of treason or
national suicide]{.underline}**. In this sense, it is not difficult to
understand why the struggle for the olive trees on the banks of the
river Jordan, emblematic of a fight over people's sense of home and
identity, has been so venomous (\[67\], 27). Equally, it is also easy to
understand why the territorial status of Taiwan has taken on such
monumental significance for both sides. An influential book on Taiwan
independence, The Four-Hundred-Year History of the Taiwanese by Shih
Ming, argues that unless the Taiwanese establish their own country, the
future of the nation will remain wretched and uncertain (\[68\], 150).
Without doubt, such a direct appeal to national identity and survival
has contributed a great deal to the further hardening of the resolve of
many Taiwanese for national self-determination. Indeed, it was precisely
on the basis of the democratic right to national self-determination that
the Taiwan authorities under Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian were able
to strenuously refuse to negotiate with Beijing on the prospects of
reunification.

### Link -- Terrorism

#### Their description of terrorist threats justifies endless war

**Jackson '09** (Richard Jackson 9, Reader in the Department of
International Politics, Aberystwyth University, and a Senior Researcher
at the Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Contemporary Political
Violence, 2009, "Knowledge, power and politics in the study of political
terrorism," in Critical Terrorism Studies: A New Research Agenda, p.
70-77)

In sum, [these frequent narratives within the literature
construct]{.underline} the [widely accepted 'knowledge' that non-state
terrorism represents a major security threat]{.underline} to the
international community and to democratic societies in particular, in
part because their inherent freedoms make them more vulnerable to
terrorist infiltration and attack. Moreover, [these narratives
construct]{.underline} a common sense and widely, though not totally,
accepted '[knowledge']{.underline} that contemporary terrorism is a new
and deadlier form of terrorism than any encountered previously, one
[which creates an]{.underline} [exceptional state of
emergency]{.underline} [requiring 'new' counterterrorism
measures]{.underline} [to defeat]{.underline} and [which]{.underline}
[cannot be dealt with using negotiation]{.underline} and dialogue,
methods which have been previously successful in dealing with the 'old'
ideological and nationalist terrorism. The origins and causes of
terrorism6 A surprising number of terrorism studies texts promote the
view that the roots and causes of terrorism lie in individual
psychological abnormality, and religious or ideological extremism
engendered through processes of 'radicalisation'. Although theories of
individual psychopathology among terrorists have fallen out of favour
among most leading scholars in recent years, the notion that terrorist
behaviour is rooted in the personality defects of individuals remains
close to the surface of most texts, not least in the notion that
weak-minded, uneducated, or emotionally vulnerable young Muslims fall
prey to indoctrination and brainwashing -- so-called 'radicalisation' --
by terrorist recruiters operating through madrasahs, radical mosques, or
extremist internet sites (see Haqqani, 2002). Related to this, it is not
uncommon to find texts which argue that 'Islamic' suicide bombers are
primarily young men driven by sexual frustration and impotence. In a
much-cited text on contemporary 'religious terrorism' for example, Mark
Juergensmeyer states that 'the young bachelor self-martyrs in the Hamas
movement .. . expect that the blasts that kill them will propel them to
a bed in heaven where the most delicious acts of sexual consummation
will be theirs for the taking' (Juergensmeyer, 2000: 201). In any case,
such narratives construct the accepted knowledge that terrorists are
different and abnormal and, more importantly, that their actions are
rooted in their personalities rather than other factors related to their
political situation, strategic calculation or experiences of oppression
and humiliation. During the cold war, many terrorism studies texts
suggested that the roots and causes of terrorism lay within communist
ideology and the direct involvement of the Soviet Union (see Raphael,
this volume). Claire Sterling's (1981) popular book, The Terror Network,
for example, posited the existence of a global terrorist network
sponsored by the Soviets that was behind many of the revolutionary and
anti-colonial movements. As Sam Raphael illustrates in this volume, a
great many of the leading terrorism studies scholars at the time
subscribed to the 'Soviet network theory' of terrorism. In many ways,
the cold war focus on left-wing ideology was replaced by what is now a
vast and growing literature on the religious origins of terrorism,
particularly as it relates to Islam (see Jackson, 2007a). Based on David
Rapoport's (1984) initial formulation of 'religious terrorism', the
discourse of 'Islamic terrorism' argues that the roots and causes of
much of the al-Qaeda-related terrorism today can be found in 'Islamic
extremism'. Walter Laqueur for example, suggests that while there is 'no
Muslim or Arab monopoly in the field of religious fanaticism . . . the
frequency of Muslim- and Arab-inspired terrorism is still striking'
(Laqueur, 1999: 129). Similarly, a prominent counterterrorism think tank
publication argues that 'in the Islamic world one cannot differentiate
between the political violence of Islamic groups and their popular
support derived from religion . . . the present terrorism on the part of
the Arab and Muslim world is Islamic in nature' (Paz, 1998, emphasis
added). Marc Sageman argues in relation to al-Qaeda: 'Salafi ideology
determines its mission, sets its goals, and guides its tactics'
(Sageman, 2004: 1). In sum, and similar to narratives of individual
deviance, these narratives construct the widely accepted 'knowledge'
that contemporary terrorism is primarily rooted in and caused by
religious extremism and fanaticism, and not in rational calculation or
other political, cultural, and sociological factors. Responding to
terrorism A final set of assumptions and narratives within the broader
literature relates to questions about how to respond to terrorism.
Following the logic of the preceding notions of the existential threat
posed by the 'new terrorism', as well as the fanatical nature and
origins of religiously-inspired terrorism, it is frequently argued in
the literature that 'new' methods of counterterrorism are required for
its control, and that there are justifiable reasons to employ any means
necessary, including torture, targeted killings, and restrictions on
human rights, to deal with the threat (see Jackson, 2007d). Rohan
Gunaratna, Paul Wilkinson, and Daniel Byman, all major figures in the
field, for example, have openly condoned the extra-judicial
assassination of terrorist leaders as a potentially effective method of
counterterrorism (see Gunaratna, 2003: 233--235; Wilkinson, 2002: 68;
Byman, 2006, 2007). At the very least, it is commonly accepted that
coercive instruments, including sanctions, pre-emption and military
force, are both legal and effective forms of counterterrorism (see for
example, Shultz and Vogt, 2003; Byman, 2003). Often unstated, but
appearing as a subtext, it is implicitly assumed that non-violent
responses to terrorism such as dialogue and political reform are simply
bound to fail in the current context (see Toros, forthcoming). More
specifically, as I have shown elsewhere (Jackson, 2005), the global
counterterrorism campaign known as [the 'war on terror' is based
on]{.underline} a particular series of [defining
narratives]{.underline}. The most important narrative at the heart of
the war on terror is the notion that the attacks of 11 September 2001
amounted to an 'act of war'. This narrative in turn, logically implies
that a war-based counterterrorism strategy is both necessary to counter
the threat and legal under international law. Consequently, a great many
terrorism studies texts take it as axiomatic or common sense that the
war on terror, and force-based counterterrorism in general, is both
legitimate and efficacious. In this way, [the notion that]{.underline}
[responding to terrorism requires]{.underline} force and
counter-violence, and sometimes even [war and torture]{.underline}, [has
come to assume a form of widely accepted 'knowledge'.]{.underline} In
short, the [assumptions, narratives and knowledge-practices]{.underline}
I have described above, and quite a few more besides, collectively [make
up much of the widely accepted body of terrorism
'knowledge',]{.underline} or, the discourse of terrorism studies.
[This]{.underline} ['knowledge' is reproduced]{.underline}, often [with
little deviation from the central assumptions]{.underline} and
narratives, [continuously in]{.underline} the field's journals,
conferences, and in [literally thousands of publications every
year]{.underline} [by academics and think tanks.]{.underline}
Furthermore, as Michael Stohl has recently illustrated, many of these
core narratives or 'myths', as he terms them, have proved to be
extremely durable over several decades (see Stohl, 1979, 2008). A
critical analysis of the terrorism studies discourse Having briefly
outlined some of its main characteristics, the purpose of this section
is to provide a critical analysis of the broader terrorism studies
discourse employing a first and second order critique. The main argument
I wish to advance here is that [most of what is accepted as well-founded
'knowledge' in terrorism studies is]{.underline}, in fact, [highly
debatable and unstable]{.underline}. More importantly, [this
'knowledge']{.underline} [functions ideologically]{.underline} [in
society to reify existing power structures and advance]{.underline}
[particular political projects]{.underline}. First order critique As
explained earlier, a first order or immanent critique employs the same
modes of analysis and categories to criticise the discourse on its own
terms and expose the events and perspectives that the discourse fails to
acknowledge or address. From this perspective, and [employing the same
social scientific modes of analysis]{.underline}, terminology, [and
empirical]{.underline} and analytical [categories employed within
terrorism studies]{.underline}, as well as many of its own texts and
authors, [it can be argued]{.underline} that [virtually all the
narratives and assumptions]{.underline} described in the previous
section [are]{.underline} [contestable and subject to
doubt]{.underline}. There is not the space here to provide
counterevidence or arguments to all the assumptions and narratives of
the wider discourse; I have provided more detailed counter-evidence to
many of them elsewhere (see Jackson, 2008a, 2008b, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c).
It must instead suffice to discuss a few points which illustrate how
unstable and contested this widely accepted 'knowledge' is. The
following discussion therefore focuses on a limited number of core
narratives, such as the terrorism threat, 'new terrorism', and
counterterrorism narratives. In the first instance, the conceptual
practices which construct terrorism exclusively as a form of non-state
violence are highly contestable. Given that terrorism is a violent
tactic in the same way that ambushes are a tactic, it makes little sense
to argue that some actors (such as states) are precluded from employing
the tactic of terrorism (or ambushes). A bomb planted in a public place
where civilians are likely to be randomly killed and that is aimed at
causing widespread terror in an audience is an act of terrorism
regardless of whether it is enacted by non-state actors or by agents
acting on behalf of the state (see Jackson, 2008a). It can therefore be
argued that if terrorism refers to violence directed towards or
threatened against civilians which is designed to instil terror or
intimidate a population for political reasons -- a relatively
uncontroversial definition within the field and wider society -- then
states can also commit acts of terrorism. Furthermore, as I and many
others have documented elsewhere (for a summary, see Jackson, 2008b),
states have killed, tortured, and terrorised on a truly vast scale over
the past few decades, and a great many continue to do so today in places
like Colombia, Zimbabwe, Darfur, Myanmar, Palestine, Chechnya, Iraq and
elsewhere. Moreover, the deliberate and systematic use of political
terror by Western democratic states during the colonial period, in the
'terror bombing' of World War II and other air campaigns, during cold
war counter-insurgency and proinsurgency campaigns, through the
sponsorship of right-wing terrorist groups and during certain
counterterrorism campaigns, among others, is extremely well documented
(see, among many others, Gareau, 2004; Grey, 2006; Grosscup, 2006;
Sluka, 2000a; Blakeley, 2006, forthcoming; Blum, 1995; Chomsky, 1985;
Gabelnick et al., 1999; Herman, 1982; Human Rights Watch, 2001, 2002;
Klare, 1989; Minter, 1994; Stokes, 2005, 2006; McSherry, 2002). [The
assumption that]{.underline} [terrorism can be objectively defined and
studied]{.underline} [is]{.underline} also [highly questionable
and]{.underline} far more [complex]{.underline} than this. It can be
argued that [terrorism is not a causally coherent, free-standing
phenomenon]{.underline} [which can be identified in terms of
characteristics inherent to the violence itself]{.underline} (see
Jackson, 2008a). In the first instance, 'the nature of terrorism is not
inherent in the violent act itself. One and the same act . . . can be
terrorist or not, depending on intention and circumstance' (Schmid and
Jongman, 1988: 101) -- and depending on who is describing the act. The
killing of civilians, for example, is not always or inherently a
terrorist act; it could perhaps be the unintentional consequence of a
military operation during war. Terrorism is therefore a social fact
rather than a brute fact, and like 'security', it is constructed through
speech-acts by socially authorised speakers. That is, ['terrorism' is
constituted by and through]{.underline} an identifiable set of
[discursive practices]{.underline} -- such as the categorisation and
collection of data by academics and security officials, and the
codification of certain actions in law -- [which]{.underline} thus [make
it a contingent 'reality']{.underline} for politicians, law enforcement
officials, the media, the public, academics, and so on. In fact, the
current discourse of terrorism used by scholars, politicians and the
media is a very recent invention. Before the late 1960s, there was
virtually no 'terrorism' spoken of by politicians, the media, or
academics; instead, acts of political violence were described simply as
'bombings', 'kidnappings', 'assassinations', 'hijackings', and the like
(see Zulaika and Douglass, 1996). In an important sense then, [terrorism
does not exist outside of the definitions and practices which seek to
enclose it]{.underline}, including those of the terrorism studies field.
Second, an increasing number of studies suggest that [the threat of
terrorism to]{.underline} Western or [international security
is]{.underline} [vastly over-exaggerated]{.underline} (see Jackson,
2007c; Mueller, 2006). Related to this, a number of scholars have
convincingly argued that the likelihood of terrorists deploying weapons
of mass destruction is in fact, miniscule (B. Jenkins, 1998), as is the
likelihood that so-called rogue states would provide WMD to terrorists.
A number of recent studies have also seriously questioned the notion of
'new terrorism', demonstrating empirically and through reasoned argument
that the continuities between 'new' and 'old' terrorism are much greater
than any differences. In particular, they show how the assertion that
the 'new terrorism' is primarily motivated by religious concerns is
largely unsupported by the evidence (Copeland, 2001; Duyvesteyn, 2004),
as is the assertion that 'new terrorists' are less constrained in their
targeting of civilians. Third, considering the key narratives about the
origins and causes of terrorism, studies by psychologists reveal that
there is little if any evidence of a 'terrorist personality' or any
discernable psychopathology among individuals involved in terrorism
(Horgan, 2005; Silke, 1998). Nor is there any real evidence that suicide
bombers are primarily driven by sexual frustration or that they are
'brainwashed' or 'radicalised' in mosques or on the internet (see
Sageman, 2004). More importantly, a number of major empirical studies
have thrown doubt on the broader assertion of a direct causal link
between religion and terrorism and, specifically, the link between Islam
and terrorism. The Chicago Project on Suicide Terrorism for example,
which compiled a database on every case of suicide terrorism from 1980
to 2003, some 315 attacks in all, concluded that 'there is little
connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, or any
one of the world's religions' (Pape, 2005: 4). Some of the key findings
of the study include: only about half of the suicide attacks from this
period can be associated by group or individual characteristics with
Islamic fundamentalism; the leading practitioners of suicide terrorism
are the secular, Marxist-Leninist Tamil Tigers, who committed
seventy-six attacks; of the 384 individual attackers on which data could
be found, only 166, or 43 per cent, were religious; and 95 per cent of
suicide attacks can be shown to be part of a broader political and
military campaign which has a secular and strategic goal, namely, to end
what is perceived as foreign occupation (Pape, 2005: 4, 17, 139, 210).
Robert Pape's findings are supported by other studies which throw doubt
on the purported religion-terrorism link (see Bloom, 2005; Sageman,
2004; Holmes, 2005). Lastly, there are a number of important studies
which suggest that force-based approaches to counterterrorism are not
only ineffective and counterproductive, but can also be damaging to
individuals, communities, and human rights (see Hillyard, 1993; Cole,
2003). Certainly, there are powerful arguments to be made against the
use of torture in counterterrorism (Brecher, 2007; Scarry, 2004;
Jackson, 2007d), and a growing number of studies which are highly
critical of the efficacy and wider consequences of the war on terrorism
(see, among many others, Rogers, 2007; Cole, 2007; Lustick, 2006). In
sum, [much of what is accepted as unproblematic 'knowledge' in terrorism
studies is]{.underline} actually [of dubious provenance]{.underline}. In
[a major review of the field,]{.underline} Andrew Silke [has described
it as]{.underline} '[a cabal of virulent myths and
half-truths]{.underline} [whose reach extends]{.underline} [even to the
most learned and experienced']{.underline} (Silke, 2004b: 20). However,
the purpose of the first order critique I have undertaken here is not
necessarily to establish the real and final 'truth' about terrorism.
Rather, first order critique aims simply to destabilise dominant
understandings and accepted knowledge, expose the biases and imbalances
in the field, and suggest that other ways of understanding,
conceptualising, and studying the subject -- other ways of 'knowing' --
are possible. [This]{.underline} kind of [critical destabilisation is
useful for]{.underline} [opening up the space needed to ask new kinds of
analytical and normative questions and]{.underline} to [pursue
alternative intellectual and political projects]{.underline}.

### Link -- Terrorism Policy

#### The epistemological crisis of counterterrorism has [institutionalized]{.underline} a policy paradigm of permanent fear -- that makes rational assessment of the threat impossible and paves over the thousands of deaths created by counterterror policies

**Jackson '15** (Richard Jackson, professor of peace studies at the
National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Otago, New
Zealand, (2015) The epistemological crisis of counterterrorism, Critical
Studies on Terrorism, 8:1, 33-54)

The consequences of counterterrorism's epistemological crisis

The significance of the epistemological crisis lies primarily in its
consequences for counterterrorism thought and practice -- which are
inextricably bound together and inseparable, in any case. That is, [the
epistemological crisis can be understood as generative of certain kinds
of thinking, actions and practices.]{.underline} As Daase and Kessler
(2007, 412) describe the process by which contemporary understandings of
terrorism construct the basis for action: "It is the relationship
between what we know, what we do not know, what we cannot know and what
we do not like to know that determines the cognitive frame for political
practice." Or, as Zulaika (2012, 58) quoting Merton notes: "If men (sic)
define situations as real, they are real in their consequences" (1968,
475). [Once the premises of the epistemological crisis have been
accepted as true, and especially once they have been institutionalised
and internalised]{.underline}, [they then form the logic or cognitive
frame for action.]{.underline} From another perspective, it can be
argued that, [once accepted and institutionalised, the epistemological
crisis acts as a kind of policy paradigm, forming a central part of the
"elite assumptions that constrain the cognitive range of useful
solutions available to policy makers"]{.underline} (Campbell 1998b,
385).

Crucially, [the epistemological crisis is not about individual or
collective negligence or the personal failures of counterterrorist
officials]{.underline}; those in charge of preventing terrorism are
likely to be genuinely concerned, responsible individuals acting in what
they perceive to be the best interests of society (Zulaika 2012, 52).
Rather, [counterterrorist failings and abuses are the result of the
broader epistemic structures and conditions -- the policy paradigm --
under which officials are forced to think and act.]{.underline}

[Apart from the trillions of dollars and millions of people in the
"security-industrial complex" who are currently invested in preventing
the coming terror]{.underline} (see Zulaika 2012, 51; Baker-Beall and
Robinson 2014), [the first and most obvious consequences of the
epistemological crisis of counterterrorism are all the fantasy-infused
security practices and postures]{.underline} discussed earlier, [as well
as the extensive programmes of security theatre enacted at airports and
elsewhere, the institutionalisation of the state of exception, and
socially disciplinary practices such as mass surveillance, control
orders, counter-radicalisation programmes, resilience initiatives and
the like]{.underline}. Zulaika (2009, 18) argues that [contemporary
counterterrorism represents a form of thinking that resembles "the
mental world of medieval witchcraft and inquisitorial
nonsense".]{.underline} Considering some of the magical realist thinking
inherent in contemporary counter-radicalisation programmes (see also
HeathKelly 2012a), including the official expression of notions of
pre-crime, the concept of "risky citizens", efforts to control words and
images considered to be capable of infection, and more, such an
assessment is entirely apposite.

[Another]{.underline} obvious and related [consequence of the
epistemological crisis of counterterrorism is the institutionalisation
and sedimentation of a politics of fear]{.underline} (see Jackson 2013,
2007). In an atmosphere of permanently "waiting for terror" and moral
panic, [threat levels are raised and lowered by officials, often on the
basis of fantastical projection rather than hard evidence, and public
fear is manipulated for electoral gain and the promotion of
non-terrorism-related political projects]{.underline}. In the process,
[the interplay of knowledge and ignorance transforms a public fear of
terrorism into a general and permanent epistemic fear]{.underline}
(Zulaika and Douglass 1996), [one which can be easily manipulated for
political gain.]{.underline} From this perspective, the epistemological
crisis of counterterrorism is functional to political elites who can
manipulate uncertainty and the underlying logic of the crisis for direct
political and material gain.

[A third]{.underline} predictable [consequence]{.underline} of the
epistemological crisis in terms of risk management and preemption [are
the well-documented and highly destructive counterterrorist practices of
preemptive war, the use of drones to kill terrorist suspects, torture
and rendition, control orders and mass surveillance.]{.underline} For
example, [given that we cannot know for certain who the terrorist is,
only that they certainly exist and are plotting mass destruction, and
that we cannot take the risk that inaction will allow them to complete
their mission, it makes perfect sense to include as many people as
possible on any terrorist watch list.]{.underline} It is now known that
in the United States, "[More than one million names are included on
secret lists of suspected terrorists]{.underline} maintained by the
Obama administration". While "people on the list are likely to be
subject to enhanced surveillance", not surprisingly in the context of
the epistemological crisis, "[almost half of the people on a key
government list don't have known ties to any specific terrorist
organisation"]{.underline} (Lee 2014; emphasis added). Given the way
that uncertainty and the unknown nevertheless create an imperative to
act preemptively, it is perhaps surprising that many more people are not
on the secret list. Of course, the reason for this is likely to be that
virtually everyone is under surveillance anyway, as the Edward Snowden
revelations demonstrate.

[A fourth consequence]{.underline} of the epistemological crisis [is the
many "false positives"]{.underline} (Heath-Kelly 2012a) [produced by the
moral imperative to act, even if "it turns out to be
wrong".]{.underline} Here [we can note the hundreds of thousands of
people killed in the invasion of Iraq aimed at preempting the "world's
most dangerous regimes]{.underline}... \[[from\] threaten\[ing\] us with
the world's most destructive weapons",]{.underline} as George Bush
famously argued. Similarly, [thousands of others have been rendered,
detained, imprisoned, tortured, assassinated in drone strikes, or like
Jean Charles de Menezes, shot to death in domestic counterterrorist
operations.]{.underline} In each case, [the moral imperative to act
preemptively overwhelmed any caution which might have been engendered by
uncertainty or lack of knowledge.]{.underline}

[Official calculations under the conditions of the epistemological
crisis state that it is better to act than not act, even if it turns out
to be wrong and leaves innocent people dead or injured]{.underline}.
Similar logic applies to the greatly enhanced security measures across
society, mass surveillance, de-radicalisation programmes, control
orders, and the like, as well as efforts to curtail opposition and
dissent in all forms, in case it proves to be the work of terrorists.
[Knowing that there are terrorists in our midst, but not knowing who
they are or what they are planning, we are bound to watch everyone,
detain anyone, secure everything, preempt attacks and prevent terrorist
intentions from emerging in the first place.]{.underline}

[Another consequence]{.underline} of the epistemological crisis [is that
the symptoms]{.underline} -- or the "signs of future threat", as Martin
(2014) puts it -- [rather than the]{.underline} deeper roots or [causes
of terrorism become the primary focus of action.]{.underline}6 That is,
[preventing the inevitable coming attacks becomes the main objective of
counterterrorism, rather than the prevention of the circumstances and
conditions that lead to terrorism in the first instance]{.underline}
(Frank 2014, 333). [This is both a consequence and cause of the taboo
which prevents direct knowledge of terrorist subjectivity. It is also
the result of rendering previous knowledge about terrorist behaviour
obsolete]{.underline}, the fatalism of accepting that terrorism will
occur whatever actions are taken, and the processes of knowledge
subjugation about the kind of policies and circumstances which give rise
to terrorism in the first place. In any case, counterterrorism efforts
have become fixated on the anticipation of imagined future plots, rather
than focused on the current actual threat and its causes (Mueller 2006).

Finally, [the epistemological crisis precludes the possibility of the
rational evaluation or cost-benefit analysis and assessment, of
counterterrorist policies]{.underline} (Mueller and Stewart 2011), [and
acts to pacify dissent and opposition to state security
programmes.]{.underline} Instead, in a context bound by anti-knowledge
and the unknown, speculation, imagination and counter-factual,
[unprovable knowledge becomes a substitute form of
assessment]{.underline}, [and the (non)victims of terrorist attacks that
never occurred (but could have) are counted as evidence of
success:]{.underline}

[Fighting terror is like fighting car accidents: one can count the
casualties but not those whose lives were spared by
prevention.]{.underline} [Hundreds, if not thousands, of Israelis go
about their lives without knowing that they are unhurt because their
murderers met their fate before they got the chance to carry out their
diabolical missions.]{.underline} [This silent multitude is the
testament to the policy's success.]{.underline} (Luft 2003, 3) Clearly,
within such a paradigm, evidence-based reform and refinement of
counterterrorist policy is unnecessary and illogical in any case. This
means that [mistakes]{.underline} tend to [recur and lessons cannot be
learned.]{.underline}

### [Link -- Ukraine]{.underline} 

#### Fear of Russian involvement in Ukraine reflects Western hypocrisy and only serves to divert attention from American aggression against Russia and Muslim states

**Donovan '14** (G Murphy Donovan is the former Director of Research for
Russian (nee Soviet) Studies at USAF Intelligence, "Russophobia and
Islamophobia," American Thinker, 3-14,
<http://www.americanthinker.com/2014/03/russophobia_and_islamophilia.html>)

It's hard to believe that it has been a quarter of a century since
Ronald Reagan began to dismantle the ideological wall that divided
Europe. Harder still to believe that [American politicians, Right and
Left, are trying to resuscitate the Cold War \-- or something hotter.
Recent events in the Ukraine seem to be giving the citizens of Europe
and America]{.underline} hot flashes of [deja-vu]{.underline}. At the
tactical level, [US policy has devolved to "regime change." At the
strategic level, US policy is simply incoherent, if not nihilistic;
swapping corrupt oligarchs for neo-fascists or religious
zealots]{.underline}. The logic for supporting recent coups have little
to do with common sense \-- or democracy. And [with Iraq, Afghanistan,
Libya, Egypt, and now the Ukraine, language needs to be coined to avoid
words like coup]{.underline}. [By any other name, a coup is still a
coup. And using a post-facto election to legitimize a coup is a little
like putting a new hat on a dead cat. The Kerry/Obama team is giving
subtlety and sovereignty bad names]{.underline}. [When Vladimir Putin,
tongue in cheek, says there are no Russian troops in the Ukraine, he
mocks John Kerry and Victoria Nuland who orchestrate dissidents in
Maidan square, in some cases neo-fascists]{.underline} who did not get
their way on the bail-out treaty with the EU. The auction for the
Ukraine is now closed. The price doubled overnight, from 16 to 35
billion dollars and counting. Politicians break it, now the taxpayer
gets to pay for it. Kerry is now offering to buy the next Ukrainian
election too. Speaking of elections, Europe and America might need
referendums at home on future bailouts, foreign and domestic. The EU and
US look like the "two broke girls" of Capitalism. Angela Merkel might be
the only European politician with any jingle left in her jeans these
days. [When Putin says he protects Crimean Russians]{.underline}, again
with a sneer, [he mocks]{.underline} Samantha Power's, now Barak
[Obama's, humanitarian interventions. The fast track to imperialism is
paved with words like "humanitarian."]{.underline} When Russia sponsors
a referendum in the Crimea, the Kremlin pre-empts, indeed ridicules, the
EU sponsored presidential election to be orchestrated by Kiev in May
2014. When demagogues like Hillary Clinton compare Russian behavior to
Nazi Germany, she mocks Allied history and the sacrifice of 5 million
Russians in WWII. Russian blood chits, we might add, that made the
Allied victory over Nazis possible in 1945. [The name of the game in the
Crimea is not the Ukraine in any case. Maidan Square and the Crimea are
merely board pieces]{.underline}, according to Vicky Nuland at the State
Department; moveable parts in another Great Game \-- [Europe versus
Russia redux]{.underline}. Back to the future, indeed! [The pillars of
Obama foreign policies are now explicit; Russophobia on one hand and
Islamophilia on the other. Indeed, a renewed Cold War with
Russia]{.underline}, sponsored by a lame duck, [allows Media shills to
change the subject. With the Ukraine in the headlines, the domestic
health care debacle and those failed Muslim wars fade to background
noise]{.underline}.

### Link -- Ukraine 

#### The Crimea crisis has been over-coded by our old Cold War fears to construct Russia as the same evil Soviet threat. This only increases antagonism.

**Peschlova '14** (Kristina Peschlova, "Discourse Strategies in Response
to the Crimean Crisis: The Case Studies of Lithuania and Slovakia," MA
thesis (Central European University, Department of International
Relations and European Studies), 2014. 48-50, 55-56)

After signing the association agreement with Ukraine, Grybauskaite said
in an interview that "We are only in \[sic\] the beginning of a cold war
... And this cold war we already saw in the form of quasi-military
actions, today we're seeing elements of the beginning of an economic
blockade for Ukraine and maybe for some other, even European countries
... We also see an absolutely open propaganda and informational war
already. Especially, we see it on our borders, in the Baltic States,
it's already open." [According to Grybauskaite, "We are facing the
largest security threats]{.underline} and challenges [after Second World
War"]{.underline} and "it's practically a prelude and [a beginning of a
'New Cold War' if Russia will not stop]{.underline}." Lithuanian
President positioned herself and her country again of the side of the
"West," [creating a clear division between "us" and "them," "othering"
Russia]{.underline}. She draw attention to the urgency of the issue that
already threatens the Baltics and is just a matter of time when it hits
them in full scale. [She formulated the Russian-Ukrainian crisis as a
prologue to a "New Cold War," adding a "dramatizing effect" to the
situation. Grybauskaite]{.underline} straightforwardly [identified
Russia as the perpetrator]{.underline}, unlike, for example, the Slovak
Prime Minister who addressed the breach of international law on rather
general terms, avoiding alienating Russia explicitly.

By re-telling the story, [the President directly drew historical
analogies between the annexation of Crimea]{.underline}n [and occupation
of the Baltic States by Russian army in the]{.underline} 19[40s, seeking
for the recognition of the "national narrative" strives for
re-assertion]{.underline}; yet again [accentuating]{.underline} its
[antagonisms towards Russia]{.underline}. The events surrounding Russian
invasion are still an essential ingredient in the national narrative of
the Lithuanian "self" and seem to "construct the past for the purposed
of the present, if only by selective emphasis."

\[Continues\]

Lithuania's reaction appears to have come across as more consensual
domestically, since [the events surrounding the invasion of Crimea
were]{.underline} more easily [integrated into the existing frame which
portrayed Russia as "unpredictable," "untrustworthy," "imperialist" and
"aggressive."]{.underline} Slovakia's position was more pragmatic,
putting an emphasis on the benefits of trade and energy dependency on
Russia. The discourse constructed by Prime Minister Fico did not apply
historical analogies of Russian invasion like in the case of Lithuania,
but on the contrary, avoided such comparisons as much as possible to the
discontent of his critics. Thus, the Crimean crisis was less
successfully integrated into the Russia-friendly frame that the
government tried to promote.

As Ehin and Berg point out, "the recognition that many of the problems
in Baltic-Russian relations are rooted in history is obviously not new,"
however, few studies tried to link the "diagnosis of the troubled
relationship" to "broader explanatory frameworks and theoretical debates
in international relations." By focusing on what is neglected by Leonard
and Popescu, for example, we can see that the concepts of
"storytelling," "othering" and "framing" help us to better understand
the dynamics of the Lithuanian-Russian relationship.

As regards scholarly work on identity, "most of the existing literature
focuses on Baltic and Russian identity constructions separately taken."
This thesis contributes to the constructivist debate on conceptions of
national identity, which are assumed as inherently relational, created
through the process of socialization and social interaction. Through the
analysis of the discourse surrounding the Crimean Crisis, this work
demonstrates that intersubjective [understandings of the "self" and
"other"]{.underline} which rest on shared historical experience [create
expectations of behavior and have implications for foreign policy
actions. The Crimean Crisis serves as an example]{.underline} of a
"challenged order," [where long-established paradigms]{.underline} that
provided a framework for both thinking and action [are prone to
"storytelling" and identity re-assertion. How the
policy-making]{.underline} then ["frame" the debate constructs political
reality within which threat perceptions are amplified]{.underline}, or
by contrast, deemphasized.

### Link -- War on Terror 

#### The aff's attempt to redeem the effort of the War on Terror represents the evolution of the national security state which produces terrorism as a self-fulfilling prophecy in an attempt to secure the globe for the West 

**Forte and McLoughlin '13** (Maximillian, Professor of Sociology at
Concordia University, Kyle, Montreal QC: Alert Press, "Emergency as
Security: The Liberal Empire at Home and Abroad", New Imperialism Vol.
3, pgs. 1-4)

"Just as our vision of [homeland security has evolved as we have made
progress in the War on Terror]{.underline}, we also have learned from
the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina....We have applied the lessons of
Katrina to this Strategy [to make sure that America is safer, stronger,
and better prepared. To best protect the American people, homeland
security must be a responsibility shared across our entire
Nation]{.underline}. As we further develop a national culture of
preparedness, our local, Tribal, State, and Federal governments,
faith-based and community organizations, and businesses must be partners
in securing the Homeland. [This Strategy also calls on each of
you....Many of the threats we face...also demand multinational effort
and cooperation. To this end, we have strengthened our homeland security
through foreign partnerships, and we are committed to expanding and
increasing our layers of defense, which extend well beyond our borders,
by seeking further cooperation with our international partners. As we
secure the Homeland]{.underline}, however, [we cannot simply rely on
defensive approaches and well-planned response and recovery
measures.]{.underline} We recognize that our efforts also must involve
offense at home and abroad". (George W. Bush, preface to Homeland
Security Council, 2007). [Fear is critical to the construction of
crisis, a component that requires both identification and motivation.
The object one fears may be an environment, idea, object, or
person(s)]{.underline}. The F works in this volume represent the
collective efforts of the seminar held in 2013 at Concordia University.
This introduction is intended to provide a theoretical frame connecting
the works in this volume of the New Imperialism to a critical
anthropology of security in the neoliberal context. In an effort to
contribute to the definition of that frame, and connect the works
contained herein, we will offer the following scheme. First, we will
briefly outline the neoliberal framework as a social and economic system
through which we argue security is a vital component, both practically
and conceptually. [Neoliberalism respects no borders, and to the extent
that neoliberalism is a core material and political practice that
underpins the new imperialism]{.underline}, the latter is relevant as
much to the U.S. and Canada, as it is to Iraq, Afghanistan, and
Venezuela. [We thus seek to connect this framework of thinking on
security in a neoliberal context to anthropological thought, but that
also questions some of the approaches contemporary anthropologists have
participated in that sustain imperial adventures abroad]{.underline}.
Finally we will highlight some of the connections to be found in the
chapters in this volume that may be useful for a critical anthropology
of the new imperialism. Daniel Goldstein (2010) argues that the post
9/11world has entered a new phase of global history characterized by the
"security moment," a state in which interactions at both international
and local contexts are fundamentally influenced by concerns over
individual and national security. That is to say [anxieties over attack,
disaster, and physical violence have become essential factors in
political regulation, commercial interest, and public
interaction]{.underline}. Perhaps no more emblematic of these concerns
is the American led "war on terror," about which George W. Bush stated
during his address to the special joint session of Congress on September
20, 2001, that, "freedom and fear are at war. The advance of human
freedom, the great achievement of our time and the great hope of every
time, now depends on us. Our nation, this generation, will lift the dark
threat of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the
world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage. We will not tire, we
will not falter and we will not fail". (Bush, 2001) Waged in the name of
domestic and international security, the "war on terror" provides, in
part, a contemporary definition of security as a social construct.
Security concerns physical bodies, feelings of terror or of threat, and
the destruction of property or interruption of commerce. Absent are
additional understandings of security concerning stability of food
sources as in food security to combat malnutrition or starvation, access
to health care, or ensuring that everyone has full employment under the
banner of job security (Goldstein, 2010, p. 491). [The war on terror and
the aftermath of 9/11 cemented a new cultural understanding of security,
the foundation of which is built upon a neoliberal capitalist ideology
of individualized risk management and privatized response in conjunction
with the retreat of societal safety nets and the privatization of the
environment]{.underline}. However, Goldstein adds an important dimension
to this: security understood in the narrow sense above, "is a
characteristic of a neoliberalism that predates the events of 9/11"
(2010, p. 487). While there is always a risk of producing overdetermined
accounts that also leave little room for the agency of the so-called
powerless, it can be useful to think of neoliberalism as a globalized
bundling of diverse concepts and concerns. These have a profound effect
on how security is conceived and practiced in the contemporary period.
[It is a globalized bundle that includes, "the dissemination of a
universal culture (consumerist), enemy (terror), political system
(procedural democracy), mode of hyperconsumption (transnational
corporate power, global economy), development aid]{.underline}
(substantial U.S. influence over the [International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank, and the World Trade Organization), and environmental
security factors (ozone depletion, global warming), among several
others]{.underline}". (Astrada, 2010, p. 5) [The neoliberal context
holds security to be that of stability of the market and the guarantee
of unobtrusive state structures to economic development]{.underline}
(for more on the relationship between neoliberalism and the new
imperialism, see Jalbert's chapter in this volume). In effect, [this
model demands that a country be sufficiently prepared to deal with the
turmoil produced by liberalization, in essence privatization and
deregulation of the economy and the erosion of any kind of social safety
net]{.underline}. States attracted/attractive to transnational capital
then become increasingly aggressive in their enforcement of social
stability. Too much trouble from popular movements could mean the flight
of investment or additional market instabilities. As Goldstein puts it,
"'[Security' calls on the power of fear to fill the ruptures that the
crises and contradictions of neoliberalism have engendered and so
functions as a principal tool of state formation and governmentality in
the world today, albeit one that is constantly challenged and negotiated
by a range of local actors and state subjects".]{.underline} (Goldstein,
2010, p. 487) As grassroots demand grows for state intervention for the
protection and fulfilment of a more popular will, a fundamental
contradiction emerges. [The demands of the people represent a spirit the
liberal democratic state is theoretically beholden to, yet at the same
time the structures and individuals that comprise the state thrive on
systems of unequal accumulation perpetuated through
capitalism]{.underline}. When the disparity between the promises of the
economic system and the reality grows, social movements or popular
struggles begin to form in response, thus representing inherent
insecurity in the continued accumulation of property and wealth (Harvey,
2005). [Such contradictions, when amounting to crisis, plainly reveal
the state's true loyalties to financial or ideological interests as
popular movements can quickly find themselves labelled as threats to
national security]{.underline} (as discussed in McLoughlin's chapter in
this volume). Goldstein, following Sawyer, thus notes what he calls a
"key irony of neoliberalism" which lies, "in the contradiction between
its rhetoric---which depicts the state as a minor player in the open
field of free capitalist activity---and its reality---in which the state
operates as manager, actuary, and cop, [maintaining this open field for
transnational business by creating laws, enforcing policy reforms, and
controlling dissent among citizens whose own economic interests run
counter to those of industry and whose social rights impose unwanted and
expensive restrictions on transnational industry"]{.underline}.
(Goldstein, 2010, p. 494) [This understanding of the neoliberal context
for security is increasingly relevant as more crises arise exposing the
fundamental contradiction between the declared loyalties of state
structures to their citizens and those states' clear collaboration with
transnational capitalist interests to continue to prosper at the expense
of those same citizens, many if not most of whom are already
marginalized by the reigning socio-economic system.]{.underline}

### Link -- Warming 

#### Environmental apocalypticism is a profoundly conservative force which shuts down deliberation and stultifies environmental movements

**Coward '14** (Jonathan Coward, MSc in Environment, Culture, and
Society from the University of Edinburgh, 2014, "'How's that for an
Ending?' Apocalyptic Narratives and Environmental Degradation:
Foreclosing Genuine Solutions, or Rhetorical Necessity?")

[What, then, is the function of the 'environmental
apocalypse']{.underline}, and how might it be perceived as a rhetorical
necessity? I perceive it to have two core functions. The first is that
apocalypse acts as a teleological-critical tool and second, that it
indeed has a political role in environmentalism.

First, environmental literatures, such as those specified above, can be
seen to have traditionally served the two primary functions of
criticism: diagnostic, and remedial. [The inclusion of an apocalyptic
tone]{.underline} adds a third aspect, oriented to the future. Put
simply, this teleological-critical function [says implicitly or
explicitly: Either the status quo must change, or humanity and nature
will end]{.underline}. Second, in uncovering this desire or need to
change, [the implementation of the apocalyptic narrative]{.underline} in
environmental literature is political. It [is employed both to increase
the saliency of environmental issues in the minds of the public and to
encourage change on an individual or collective level]{.underline}. The
technique recognizes the fact that [although awareness of environmental
issues is now very high, they continue to be low priority for
many]{.underline} (Whitmarsh 2011, 691). Killingsworth and Palmer (1996,
22) succinctly observe that for political change to actually occur, a
transformation in consciousness is required to translate awareness into
action. This is achieved through the teleological-critical function of
apocalypse, thus indicating the link between its two facets.

From theory to reality?: Criticisms and capitalism's co-option

It is important, however, to state that [although the role of apocalypse
in environmentalism appears to be useful in theory, this is not
necessarily translated into reality]{.underline}. Ultimately, [the
intended consequences of framing environmental degradation in an
apocalyptic manner do not always materialize]{.underline}. [Instead, the
result is not that of transformation, but of a perpetuation of the
political and economic forces that underlie environmental degradation,
and thus the possibility of change becomes its opposite]{.underline}.
Criticisms of the apocalyptic tendency in environmentalism go some way
towards explaining its failings. I argue that these are: alarmism;
quasi-religious undertones, and anti-progressivism.

The accusation that certain environmental texts---or even that
environmentalism itself---tends to exaggerate to the point of alarmism
is a common criticism put forward (Bailey 1993; Simon 1995, 23; Risbey
2008). Arguably, exaggeration has its merits. In a broad, philosophical
sense, Adorno (2003) claims it to be the contemporary "medium of truth,"
while in terms of apocalyptic narratives specifically, Killingsworth and
Palmer (1996, 41) claim that, "if the "predicted devastation is extreme
in the apocalyptic narrative, then the change in consciousness of
political agenda recommended by the narrator is correspondingly extreme
or radical." In other words, exaggeration is required, because anything
less would result in mere reformism and this simply isn't enough to
protect what's under threat. And although this is a fair rebuttal,
[empirical evidence shows that the criticism is valid and that
apocalyptic rhetoric can disengages the wider public from partaking in
environmental activism]{.underline}. [In Feinberg and
Willer's]{.underline} (2011) [study, individuals who were primed with
just-world statements, followed by exposure to dire messages of the
severity of global warming, reported higher levels of climate change
skepticism]{.underline} (ibid, 36). These [participants were also less
likely to change their lifestyle to reduce their carbon
footprint]{.underline}. This indicates a problem with the public
perception of environmental apocalypticism.

Furthermore, through its use of apocalyptic narratives, [ecology has
been perceived as having quasireligious qualities]{.underline}. While it
is worth questioning some of the ecology-as-religion arguments made by
critics such as Simon (1995, 23), the possibility that the religious
qualities of ecology are more than superficial should not be dismissed.
One view is that [a prophetic ecology cannot espouse radical change
because, like religion, it in fact holds an inherently conservative
worldview]{.underline}. This conservatism comes in two forms. One, of
lesser concern, which is neo-luddite in character, and seeks the return
to a less technologically demanding time, and the other which looks to
conserve present economic and political systems because change is
perceived as being inherently bad. As Žižek states, although ecologists
are all the time demanding that we change radically our way of life,
underlying this demand is its opposite, a deep distrust of change, of
development, of progress: every radical change can have the unintended
consequence of triggering a catastrophe. (Žižek 2008) Instead, I would
argue that ecological movements that are framed by catastrophic rhetoric
do not distrust progress generally, and where radical change is argued
to be necessary---i.e. Kovel's (2002) eco-socialist agenda---that there
is a genuine commitment to this change. Rather [the opposition is to a
highly political ideology of progress based upon the technological
domination of organic life in the name of capitalist productivism and
economic growth]{.underline}.

What explains the continuing pervasiveness of the ideology of progress
over ecologies which warn of its fatal dangers? It's worth considering
for a moment, the fact that [it is acknowledged that natural limits and
environmental tipping points exist. Despite this knowledge, production
and consumption continue at increasing rates, while natural resources
are depleted, and natural habitats are polluted]{.underline}. This is
not merely a case of knowing ignorance, or Orwellian doublethink, but
something greater. [It relates to the reality perceived by humankind in
present day capitalism]{.underline}.

As Bill McKibben states: "\[I\]n some sense, [the physical world is no
longer as real to us as the economic world]{.underline} - we cosset and
succor to the economy; [our politicians gear every decision to speeding
further its growth." This is the phenomenon of 'capitalist
realism]{.underline}' (Fisher 2009), [where economy assumes the role of
reality]{.underline}. In capitalist realism, [everything in existence is
"organized within the horizons of a capitalist order that is beyond
dispute]{.underline}." (Swyngedouw 2013, 13) [It is the failure to see
capitalist social relations as what they truly are: a social construct
answerable to humankind, and ultimately to Earth's environmental
system]{.underline}1.

Applying this to apocalyptic environmental narratives, it's clear that
even with the criticalteleological function bringing to light the
ultimate choice between the end of capitalism and the end of nature,
capitalist realism denies the existence of the teleology, hence the oft
repeated statement: [It's easier to imagine the end of the world than
the end of capitalism]{.underline}. But, having recognized the failure
and futility in using imaginaries of apocalypse to bring about change,
the question remains, as to how the rhetoric of catastrophe might serve
to foreclose genuine solutions.

A persuasive case is put forward in the article Apocalypse Now! Fear and
Doomsday Pleasures by Swyngedouw (2013). His argument consists of two
central points. The first is that [environmental problems are "commonly
staged as universally threatening to the survival of humankind," and
that the apocalyptic environmental narratives that stem from this, are
populist, resisting a proper political framing in the traditional
left-right sense]{.underline} (ibid., 11,13). [This results in the
insistence that the fear-inducing threat is merely a technical problem,
requiring techno-managers to take charge]{.underline}. Of course, [a
technocracy in capitalist society is not politically
neutral]{.underline}. Therefore [any problem, environmental or otherwise
is managed upon economic terms to ultimately serve capital]{.underline}
(ibid., 13). Naomi [Klein]{.underline}'s Shock Doctrine (2008)
[describes numerous examples of this tendency, such as the mass
privatization of the public school system in New Orleans, in the wake of
Hurricane Katrina]{.underline}: "The administration of George W.
Bush\[... provided\] tens of millions of dollars to convert New Orleans
schools into\[...\] publicly funded institutions run by private
entities." (Klein 2008, 5) Here, [the pervasiveness of capitalist
realism in the context of catastrophe is evident]{.underline}.

Additionally, [the framing of catastrophe as crisis implies that total
(environmental) devastation is something to be managed within current
social, political and economic institutions]{.underline}: While
catastrophe denotes the irreversible radical transformation of the
existing into a spiralling abyssal decline, [crisis is a conjunctural
condition that requires particular techno-managerial
attention]{.underline}. (Klein 2008, 10) This has been especially clear
in attempts to manage parts of nature that are likely to be subject to -
or subject of - some degree of catastrophe, such as ecosystems,
valorized for the purposes of conservation (i.e. UK National Ecosystems
Assessment 2011), and carbon, commodified as permits to be freely traded
within a carbon-market (ibid, 13). Thus, it should be clear that [using
the apocalyptic imaginary to frame issues of environmental degradation
isn't only futile, rather the solutions it intends are foreclosed by the
co-option of the narrative by capitalist institutions]{.underline}.

Finally, could it even be argued that the aforementioned mass-culture of
armageddon---an expression of the ongoing, popular fascination with the
end---is free from capitalist realism? I would agree with Fisher (2009)
in saying that perhaps it isn't. Take for example, Disney Pixar's 2008
film, [Wall-E, premised upon on a lonely robot, charged with the task of
cleaning up an abandoned Earth following the global rule of the 'Buy \'N
Large' corporatio]{.underline}n2. Fisher (ibid.) argues that "[we're
left in no doubt that consumer capitalism and corporations\[... are\]
responsible for this depredation]{.underline}\[...\] but the film
performs our anti-capitalism for us, allowing us to continue to consume
with impunity." Moreover, in relation to the ideology of progress, [the
film also espouses the idea of there being a technological fix to
Earth's ecological tribulations, in the form of Wall-E
himself]{.underline}. Even in post-apocalyptic drama, The Road (2009),
motifs of capitalist ideology are present. Despite the fall of society
and the wrecking of nature, ideas of self-interested behavior persist,
in the strikingly Hobbesian 'war of all against all', for human flesh.3

## Impacts

### Impact -- Turns Case 

#### Arms control fails -- it consolidates military power to the West and provokes insecurity 

**Cooper 2006** (Neil, Director of the School of Peace and Conflict
Studies at Kent State University, "Putting Disarmament Back in the
Frame", Review of International Studies 32:2, pg 362)

It is sufficient at this juncture to note that what characterises
[**this system** of arms limitation is]{.underline} the way in which it
is [structured to consolidate and preserve the military superiority of
the US in particular and the West in general. Moreover, rather than
reinforcing security this profound military imbalance promotes
insecurity - both by creating incentives for other actors to pursue
asymmetric technologies (NBC) or strategies (terrorism) that offset the
US\'s conventional superiority,35 and by diverting resources that could
be expended on human security to militarism]{.underline}. At best, the
contemporary arms limitation system aims to keep the lid on such
contradictions by setting in place a variety of disciplinary mechanisms
that attempt to constrain asymmetric military responses whilst
simultaneously preserving the asymmetrical advantages of the West. At
worst, **i**[n attempting to contain pressures that may ultimately be
uncontainable, the contemporary arms limitation system may promote an
illusion of relative security whilst positively fostering a variety of
insecurities]{.underline}. However, a few more comments are in order
before we proceed to consider this system of asymmetrical arms
limitation in more

### Impact -- Environment 

#### The political ontology they invest in guarantees environmental destruction

**Collins '15** (Sheila D Collins, professor of political science
emerita at William Paterson University, May 2015, "War-Making as an
Environmental Disaster," *New Labor Forum* Volume 24 Number 2)

As a response to political conflict, militarism seems to be the world's
modus operandi. Yet [militarism itself is a major, but overlooked
contributor to climate change. The Pentagon is the world's largest
industrial consumer of fossil fuels. Fighter jets, destroyers, tanks,
and other weapons systems emit highly toxic, carbon-intensive emissions,
not to mention the GHGs that are released from the detonation of bombs.
To understand the impact of our commitment to militarism, one has to
take into account not only the carbon dioxide equivalent]{.underline}13
[of the fuels that are directly used by the military (for transportation
and in the building of military infrastructure, weapons, and so on) but
also those related to the U.S. military's role in protecting global
maritime petroleum distribution, as well as the wars in the Middle East
related to securing global petroleum reserves]{.underline}. Despite the
Pentagon's decision to include more biofuels in its energy mix, [the GHG
emissions from the production of biofuels, as well as their indirect
effects, also need to be measured. A study published in 2010 estimated
that total emissions from U.S. conventional military fuel use and
acquisitions totaled about 172 million metric tons]{.underline} (MMt)
[of CO2 equivalent per year]{.underline}. Of that, [an estimated 16 MMt
of CO2 equivalent per year may be attributed to the military's role in
securing global oil supplies]{.underline}.14 An additional 43.3 MMt is
attributed to the Iraq war. [To get some idea of this military
contribution to global warming, consider that 172 million MMt is roughly
equivalent to driving an average passenger vehicle four and a half
billion miles a year, or burning almost 185 billion pounds of
coal]{.underline}.15 The Pentagon is the world's largest industrial
consumer of fossil fuels. Moreover, unlike warfare before the twentieth
century---where weapons were used to kill by piercing and crushing human
bodies---[twentieth- and twenty-first-century warfare is designed to
kill by destroying and poisoning the enemy's environment, making such
warfare---even setting aside its contribution to GHG
emissions---qualitatively more environmentally
destructive]{.underline}.16 [Not only are modern weapons environmentally
destructive when used but also the extraction, production, transporting,
storing, and testing of the materials used in them leaves its own toxic
trail]{.underline}. [Think of the history of uranium production and
testing, or the nine hundred toxic military production sites that dot
the American landscape, turning thousands of acres into uninhabitable
"sacrifice zones]{.underline}." [More than twelve thousand U.S. military
sites where weapons testing takes place have been found to release
perchlorate, a toxic chemical that affects thyroid and respiratory
function, into the groundwater]{.underline}.17 More than twelve thousand
U.S. military sites where weapons testing takes place have been found to
release \[into the groundwater\] a toxic chemical that affects thyroid
and respiratory function. The United States and its allies have spent
trillions financing anti-terrorist military operations in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The United States alone spent \$2.6 trillion
between 2001 and 2014 but has taken obligations to spend as much as
\$4.4 trillion.18 Moreover, as the largest arms supplier (and importer)
in the world, the United States fuels conflicts directly and indirectly.
Many of these weapons fall into the hands of non-state actors like ISIS
and Boko Haram, thus multiplying the arenas of military conflict.
Although the terrible social, cultural, and economic costs are publicly
discussed, little is said about the environmental costs of such wars,
and little research has been conducted into these costs, leaving the
public in ignorance and without the knowledge necessary to question and
challenge the military's role.19 To make matters worse, [the military
sector]{.underline}---with the exception of the military's domestic fuel
use, that is, the emissions related to the military's use of fossil
fuels within the United States but not abroad---[is excluded from UN
inventories of national GHG emissions, thanks to intensive lobbying by
the United States at the Kyoto Protocol negotiations]{.underline}.20
[The exclusion of much of the military sector from national GHG
inventories thus makes a mockery of the UN climate negotiations
process]{.underline}. The exclusion of much of the military sector from
national greenhouse gas inventories makes a mockery of the UN climate
negotiations process. [How quickly the world has forgotten the terrible
environmental legacies of past wars! During the Vietnam War, the U.S.
army sprayed eighty million liters of the defoliant Agent
Orange---containing the highly toxic chemical dioxin, as well as other
herbicides---over more than 24 percent of the land area of South
Vietnam, leaving nearly five million acres of denuded or heavily
defoliated upland and coastal forests---about 36 percent of the total
mangrove forest, an ecosystem rich in biodiversity---and damaging some
five hundred thousand acres of rice and other crops. It will take
centuries to reproduce the ecologically balanced mix of flora and fauna
that once thrived there]{.underline}.21 Between 2.1 to 4.8 million
Vietnamese were directly exposed to Agent Orange and other herbicides
during the War, as were thousands of U.S. soldiers. As late as 2014,
children were still being born with birth defects from the poison.
[During the first Gulf War, Saddam Hussein set an estimated eight
hundred Kuwaiti oil wells ablaze. The thick plumes of smoke that rose as
high as six kilometers into the atmosphere produced an estimated three
thousand four hundred metric tons of soot per day]{.underline}. More
than twenty times the amount of oil that was spilled in the Exxon Valdez
disaster in Alaska flowed into the Persian Gulf, causing irreparable
harm to the Gulf's ecological integrity.22 Having learned nothing from
these disasters, [we now have the spectacle of the United States bombing
oil refineries in Syria]{.underline} in an attempt to cripple the oil
revenue stream to ISIS.

### Impact -- Gender Violence 

#### The 1AC's fear-driven discourse of global instability is based in gendered theories of state behavior that reinforces insecurity and violence

Generally speaking, the gendered approach in IR "interrogates how
[masculine values and worldviews have shaped diplomacy]{.underline}."5
Introducing a larger study, Rebecca Grant and Kathleen Newland present
the broad claim of GS in IR: [The exclusion of women's experience from

consequences]{.underline} both [for the discipline and for male and
female inhabitants of the real world]{.underline}. A central hypothesis
is that [this exclusion has resulted in an academic field excessively
focused on conflict and anarchy]{.underline}, and a way of practising
statecraft and formulating strategy that is excessively focused on
competition and fear.6 In the paper, the claim is made that [when it
comes to Northeast Asian security]{.underline}, both
[statecraft]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [scholarship]{.underline}
**are** indeed "[excessively focused on competition and
fear]{.underline}." Hence, in the following investigation, "gender
lenses" will be used to look at security dynamics on the Korean
Peninsula. The project's starting assumption is that the [major
Northeast Asian security discourses are gender-biased and]{.underline}
that [the theoretical paradigm]{.underline} most often [used in
investigations of this region's security issues, Realism, keeps
channeling the relevant discourses toward a gender-biased
understanding]{.underline} [of Northeast Asian security
matters]{.underline}. In response, and in order to probe alternative
explanations, "gender glasses" will be put on. The hope is that the
[investigation]{.underline} below [will contribute to "more robust
thinking"]{.underline}7 [on security matters in Northeast
Asia]{.underline} generally and on the Korean Peninsula specifically.
The hope rests on the impressive scholarship on "gendered dimensions of
war, peace, and security"8 which has already been generated by scholars
and students of GS in IR. The Wider Context: Northeast Asian Security In
the twenty-first century, Northeast Asia remains a security hotspot. A
dependable and stable Northeast Asian security arrangement remains
elusive. [For decades, statesmen and stateswomen, diplomats, and
politicians have been confronted with]{.underline} a multitude of
[dangerous]{.underline} and destabilizing [developments in Northeast
Asia]{.underline}, from [North Korea]{.underline}n "military-diplomatic
campaigns,"9 and nuclear and missile tests conducted by Pyongyang, to
the rise of [China]{.underline} and a corresponding American "pivot to
Asia,"10 and a possible expansion of Japan's military posture in the
Asia-Pacific.11 IR theory has been used to describe the situation and
explain state behavior. Theory has also been used to guide state action
in Northeast Asia. A plethora of perspectives has been applied, from
Constructivist Theory, Foreign Policy Analysis, Institutionalism, to
non-traditional Security Studies, to name just a few.12 However,
[Realism has been the dominant IR theory in the discourses on Northeast
Asia]{.underline}. [The broad Realist paradigm presents the world as
anarchical and power-based]{.underline}, [resulting in fear, hostility,
and the security dilemma]{.underline}. However, [the Realist paradigm
tends to privilege "masculine" behavior, such as demonstrations of
power, over alternative actions that are seen as weak and "female"
behavior]{.underline}. Thus, it is proposed to apply GS's theoretical
and conceptual paradigms and work towards a fresh investigation of
Northeast Asian security from a gendered perspective. The hope is that
[by challenging the Realist discourse on Northeast Asian security, new
insights and policy options can be generated]{.underline}.

### Impact -- Logistics 

#### Narratives of liberal peace are used to secure a violent system of state logistics that operates through the biopolitical control of populations 

**Culp '09** (Andrew Culp, teaches Media History and Theory in the MA
Program in Aesthetics and Politics and the School of Critical Studies at
CalArts, "Producing Pacification: The Disciplinary Technologies of Smart
Bombs and National Anti-War Organizing", Electronic Thesis or
Dissertation. Ohio State University, 2009. *OhioLINK Electronic Theses
and Dissertations Center*, pgs. 9-12)

The key to [Reid's reading of Foucault]{.underline} is his suggestion
that most scholars overlook Foucault's unique formulations that work to
[describe the management of populations through war under
liberalism]{.underline}. His argument draws heavily on Discipline and
Punish and Society Must Be Defended to argue that [liberal regimes
reduce society to a docile population through massive logistical
controls]{.underline}. [Those controls work on both registers of
biopower: the disciplinary tactics of the body that individuate subjects
and establish a predictable social order, and the biopolitics of the
population which create strategies that regulate collective bodies of
population]{.underline}. What [Reid accuses others of
forgetting]{.underline} is the **[investment in a system of logistics
that such a system requires to continue operating]{.underline}**. [Not
only are bodies part of a social order]{.underline}, which Reid argues
is deeply rooted in logistics, [but they are invested in that social
order as a way of life.]{.underline} [Liberalism's commitment to the
population is then less about ideologically specific socio-historical
political forms]{.underline} (like the GOP or identity politics groups)
[but the logistical apparatus necessary to keep the population alive
(but alive enough only to maximize reproduction]{.underline}, as Agamben
would remind us). **[And while debates about how best way to secure the
logistical life of the population may be politicized, conflicts are
tempered by a higher principle -- the docile peace that maintains a
stable enough social order to maximize the logistical potential of
society.]{.underline}**

[The strategy used to produce and maintain a docile
population]{.underline}, argues Reid, **[deploys the technologies of
pacification invented by the military sciences.]{.underline}**
[Logistics are then a means to achieve greater
pacification]{.underline}, [whether by producing subjects that will also
contribute to the pacification of society or by accumulating
disciplinary techniques to more effectively wage war on those not
willing to stay pacified]{.underline} (Reid 17-8). [Liberal society has
inherited the military science origins of disciplinary power and in the
transformation from its purely military context,]{.underline} it has
smuggled in militarism as it generalized the use of disciplinary
techniques [to perfect the conditions for reproducing and extending
logistical life. **War is not the opposite of liberalism then, but
rather the task it is always preparing for and enacting**, either in the
millions of small disciplinary interventions of everyday life or through
the regular militaristic mobilization of troops and
armaments]{.underline}. {'If we don't get them with the internet and
video games, we'll get them with our guns and bombs.'}

By privileging the pacification of the population above the status of
any individual subject of a nation-state, [war in the age of logistical
life complicates the conception of inside/outside that is central to
classical international relations]{.underline}. [It is not just about
capturing the king]{.underline}, as in chess and medieval warfare [but
securing a way of life for the whole population. One of these
complications involves stripping the exceptional status of subjects that
nationhood or citizenship would usually protect.]{.underline} **[Since
the aim of biopolitics is the passive survival of collective
populations, anything that threatens logistical life becomes a threat
that must be managed]{.underline}**. The War on Terror is a clear
demonstration of this logic: it mobilizes a discourse that claims that
there are abject bad ubjects -- terrorists -- whose political expression
threatens the most crucial aspect of liberalism -- well-ordered
logistical life -- and that they therefore must be eliminated from the
global logistical order or threatens the dissolution of the logistical
way of life. [But while terrorists are a paradigmatic case, the variety
of subjects that could be classified as a threat to logistical life is
almost endless -- if a subject is perceived as too disruptive, too
unpredictable or too costly, the protections of logistical life are
withdrawn and the subject is left to fend for itself and potentially
die]{.underline} (Open 38). This leaves us with an unsettling question:
how thin is line (or as Agamben would note, the möbius strip) that
separates this way of life from Kafka's giant bureaucratic assemblages
or Terry Gilliam's Brazil?

A second complication, as Foucault's genealogy of the emergence of
liberalism in Security, Territory, Population indicates, is that [the
limits of logistical system of modern nation-states have spread far
beyond the territorial boundaries of the State]{.underline} (51-71). [As
nation-states work to secure and expand their logistical potential, wars
take on an increasingly administrative function that look more like
policing actions]{.underline}. [The official justifications for the war
in Iraq barely concealed the fact that the United States saw Iraq as an
impediment to its expanding logistical apparatus]{.underline} -- a
combination of Iraq being in control of major geo-strategic resources
and the belligerence of Iraqi leader's refusals to submit to United
States hegemony (Afflicted Powers 102-7). Reid's definition of
logistical life must be expanded in order to discuss the character of
how and why wars are engaged, however. In particular, opening up
logistical life to an analysis of the changing political economy would
ground logistical life in the concrete particularities of the changing
capitalist mode of production. Despite his very public distance from the
party Marxism of the PCF, Foucault's recently translated Collége de
France lectures show that his later intellectual work was highly
informed by political economy. Especially because liberalism's form is
so intimately tied to the economic subjects it produces, this may be the
most fruitful ground for modifying and extending Reid's book, especially
in light of The Birth of Biopolitics lectures touched on above.

### Impact -- Mundane Violence 

#### Western military at its core is built on securitizing specific groups of people in and out of the state in even mundane/everyday public experiences that makes liberal militarism an insecurity for many "other" groups. 

**Basham 2018** (Victoria, Reader, Senior Lecturer of International
Relations at Cardiff University, "Liberal militarism as insecurity,
desire and ambivalence: Gender, race and the everyday geopolitics of
war" Militarism and security: Dialogue, possibilities and limits, 2018,
Vol. 49(1-2), pp 38-40)

In accounting for the role of everyday fears in animating militarism,
Razack's (2008) scholarship drawing on Arendt's concept of race-thinking
has proved especially useful. Razack argues [that 'race-thinking'
pervades contemporary Western law and politics, drawing crude
differentiations between people of European descent and those descended
from elsewhere. Race-thinking entails that 'Europeans' come to
understand themselves as sharing a common humanity with one another, but
not with 'non-Europeans'; accordingly, in sharing nothing in common with
a racialized (enemy) other, many Europeans have begun to understand
themselves as 'under siege']{.underline} (Razack, 2008: 5). Contrary to
salient liberal understandings, [neither race-thinking nor its
expression in racism requires individuals or social groups to regard
themselves as superior or act in overtly hostile ways towards those
deemed 'different'. For race-thinking and racism to flourish and shape
people's lives, all that is required is the belief that racialized
others constitute some sort of 'threat to our way of life']{.underline}
(Martin Barker, cited in Duffield, 2007: 200). [Contemporary state
border practices, including those aimed at Syrian refugees, attempt to
manage such risks to 'our way of life' at the border, defining at once
that which endangers and the 'integrity of the inside ... the presumed
homogeneity and stability of that community' (Salter, 2006: 172). This
simultaneously produces a knowledge of geopolitics that evokes the
boundedness of the nation-state to be protected and the dangerous
unboundedness of the border that must be reinforced]{.underline}. The
revelation that two of the attackers involved in the Paris attacks might
have used refugee routes to enter Europe led to a decline in public
support for the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the UK, with 44% of
Britons reported to believe that the UK should close its borders to
refugees entirely (Nardelli, 2015). As Salter (2006: 180) explains,
though, [it is not simply that states manage subjects but that the price
of 'freedom', of an everyday life removed from insecurity, is that 'we
come to manage ourselves through a confessionary complex'. Key to this
is that we 'recognize ourselves as a society, as part of a social
entity, as a part of a nation or of a state']{.underline} (Michel
Foucault, cited in Salter, 2006: 181) and regard others as outside this.
[The desire for this way of life means, therefore, that it is not just
existential insecurity that facilitates war and war preparedness, but
the multitude of insecurities that make up everyday life, from needing
to have steady employment to wanting to feel part of a social and
political community. Thus, while global fears are materialized and
affective in everyday sites, other and often more pressing matters also
play a role in the reproduction of liberal militarism]{.underline} (Pain
and Smith, 2008). As Dowler (2012: 497) points out, this is why [it is
vital to consider how 'militarization takes root in the banal processes
of daily life that are essential to the reproduction of
sovereignty']{.underline}. As Eastwood (this issue) argues, though,
everyday desire for war also animates militarism; [fear only gets us so
far. Importantly, however, as Eastwood also contends, desire is not
necessarily fervent: it can be more ambiguous, even
unconscious.]{.underline} Anthropologist Gerald Sider (2008: 124--125)
sheds further light on this when describing the everyday as an
achievement; as those ways in which people work through and against the
chaos, rupture and discontinuity that shape their lives to 'try to make
and to claim some kind of ordinary -- some stability to today, some
continuity between yesterday and tomorrow, in some parts of their lives
at least'. Sider (2008: 125) moreover maintains that 'what we call
everyday life does not name a feature or an aspect of social existence
... but a very high-stakes struggle' -- a struggle that is for many
people throughout the world 'largely unavoidable and often in the medium
to long run unwinnable'. The desire for the ordinary should not be
underestimated, therefore; it takes on a profound, if often
taken-for-granted, importance not least 'because it belongs to the
people who have it -- it is their time, their space, what makes their
moments and their interactions their space and place' (Sider, 2008:
129--130, emphasis in original). [It is not difficult to imagine why
this possession of 'normality' would be desirable to liberal populations
promised that freedom is the very condition of their existence.
Perceived threats to that freedom might motivate fears and suspicions
that foster militarism]{.underline}. Equally, though, in the example of
Syrian airstrikes, and hostility and ambivalence to resettling Syrian
refugees, the desire of British citizens to have everyday lives free
from concern about the everyday lives of others may call into question
the ability of Syrians to have not only an everyday but any life at all.
[While such effects of desire to protect one's own everyday are not
always deliberate or callous, the prioritization of some lives and ways
of life over others facilitates biopolitical forms of state power that
entail that 'the liberal way of war is governed, in part, by the very
exercise of such discrimination and the application of lethal violence
to it']{.underline} (Dillon and Reid, 2009: 49). You do not have to be a
refugee to become abject as an outcome of such desires, though.
[Biopolitics circulates within as well as without liberal societies.
While most can go about their everyday lives in relative security, some
find it more difficult to socially reproduce themselves not least
'because the larger society is rewarded when they don't make it, and
leave or die']{.underline} (Sider, 2008: 132). Although, as Stanko
(1990) warns, the potential for violence is something that characterizes
the everyday lives of anyone who has ever stayed alert on the street,
there are some lives characterized by more socially and materially
violent everyday struggles. [Frequently, these lives are cast as a drain
or scourge on society, made abject by terms such as 'chav', 'scrounger',
'benefit dependant', 'single mother', 'migrant', 'asylum-seeker',
'ethnic minority', 'Muslim' and 'refugee']{.underline}. Each label
shapes people's 'grounded expectation\[s\] of a liveable tomorrow',
which may constitute bigger struggles for some than for others (Sider,
2008: 128). [The desires of the many to carry on regardless elide these
gendered, biopolitical and socio-economic struggles, however, and while
the legitimacy of the modern liberal state may still lie in its ability
to secure, practices of 'making live' always entail practices of letting
die within as well as without (Foucault, 2004).]{.underline} [The strong
desire for an everyday, for ordinariness, can also facilitate
ambivalence, not just fear and desire]{.underline}. As Stavrianakis
(2016) shows, while state rhetorics of sustainable security, [human
rights and humanitarianism mean that British involvement in arming
illiberal regimes is often presented more as a tension than a
fundamental contradiction, this 'tension' can still facilitate
ambivalence about Britain's militarism. This could explain, in part, why
polls of the British public do not always suggest the kind of
militaristic fervour often exhibited by the state]{.underline}
(Mortimer, 2015). Bauman (1991) argued that ambivalence is the condition
of our times because, contrary to the promise that modernity would
generate clarity about human life, it is instead defined by uncertainty
and insecurities that threaten the orderliness of the world, confounding
our ability to calculate the meaning of practices and events and to see
the relevance of our memorized patterns of action[. Ambivalence towards
militarism -- war and constantly preparing for it -- can thrive in these
conditions precisely because militarism becomes a normalized feature of
a chaotic worl]{.underline}d. In everyday sites and spaces, it will thus
be possible to discern support for British airstrikes existing alongside
opposition, and alongside ambivalence and ignorance. What is most
significant, I would suggest therefore, is not what British citizens
believe about the airstrikes or wider British military action or how
many of them believe what they believe, but the fact that support,
opposition, ignorance, ambivalence, fear and so on are all possible
reactions for most British citizens precisely because they have an
everyday. Continuing to pay your taxes, to wave flags at military and
monarchical parades, and to purchase poppies for the 'fallen' (Basham,
2016) may not seem like the most deliberate or obvious sites of
militarism, but banal does not mean innocuous (Arendt, 1963; Thomas and
Virchow, 2005). [After all, liberal militarism, as I have argued,
produces diffuse and often uneven effects within British society as well
as without]{.underline}. As postcolonial and feminist scholars have long
argued, [this is why it is vital to look to the everyday; whereas 'the
construction of a single national identity may seem obvious at a global
scale ... it is less clear when viewed by way of sociospatial forces
such as gender, race, and class']{.underline} (Dowler and Sharp, 2001:
171). [Everyday experiences thus remind us that, despite state claims to
the contrary, liberal militarism is insecurity for many]{.underline}.

### Impact -- Ontology of War 

#### Current methods of understanding conflict and its underlying causes leaves underlying systems unexamined, existential and rational ontologies inevitably generate violence

**Burke 2007** (Anthony, Professor at the School of Humanities and
Social Sciences at UNSW Canberra ,\"Ontologies of War: Violence,
Existence and Reason.\" Theory & Event, vol. 10 no. 2, 2007)

On 12 July 2006 the Israel Defense Force (IDF) began a month-long air
and ground war in Lebanon. After the bombing and firing finally ceased,
[1191 Lebanese civilians and 159 Israelis were dead, and 1.5 million
people had been driven from their homes.1 It cost Israel \$1.6 billion
and, in Lebanon, destroyed at least \$4 billion in homes and
infrastructure]{.underline} such as roads, bridges, power plants and
airfields.2 [Oil spills caused by the Israeli bombing of the Jiyeh power
station and forest fires caused by Hezbollah rockets also created grave
environmental damage that will take decades to repair]{.underline}.3 It
was the fifth major Israeli incursion into Lebanon since 1978, and one
well-placed Washington analyst grimly predicted that there will be many
more.4 [Much of the debate around the war focused on competing claims
about its legitimacy and prosecution]{.underline} \-- Hezbollah struck
first, Israel acted disproportionately etc. \-- [as if these were to be
taken as definitive horizons for thought about the conflict and its
underlying causes. However, even as such debate has importance, it
remains hostage to the event and to its most superficial level of
description. It leaves the underlying knowledge and bureaucratic systems
that drive and shape actions and choices, especially those which relate
to the use of strategic violence, unexamined]{.underline}. In contrast,
in this essay I wish to speculate on two powerful structures of state
and strategic reason that lie beneath such claims, hidden and
uncritiqued; structures that drive violence as a social technology and
way of being, and for which events are so much occasion and
justification, mere surface effects, like the debris left after a storm.
These structures \-- which I term [\'existential\' and \'rationalist\'
forms of state reason]{.underline} \-- [are easily discernible beneath
the surface of the recent war]{.underline}. [The first is visible in
justifications mobilised by the government of Israel and its western
supporters, justifications that invoke the most basic fears about
Israel\'s security and existence as a state]{.underline}. The then IDF
Chief of Staff, Air Force General Dan Halutz, told his troops that they
were \'defending the integrity of their country\'; they were \'fighting
an extremist Islamic terrorist organisation that denies our right to
exist\'.5 And after the bombing of an apartment building in southern
Lebanese town of Qana, which killed at least 28 civilians, Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert said that: Citizens of Lebanon, we are sorry for
the pain caused to you, and the fact that you had to pick up and flee
your homes, and also the casualties caused among innocents\...But we
will not apologise to those who put a question mark on the right of
Israel to exist.6 The Australian Prime Minister John Howard, a supporter
of Israel and close strategic and ideological ally of George W. Bush,
mobilised a similar explanation in an interview with the Australian
Broadcasting Corporation in July. He was asked whether, \'in the face of
up to 700,000 refugees and billions of dollars in infrastructure
destroyed, and a government that is fragile at best, in terms of the
sheer pragmatics, don\'t you question the ruthless extent of Israel\'s
response?\', only to respond: Once you are attacked\...and if that
attack is in the context of a 50-year rejection of your right to exist,
which is the situation in relation to Iran \-- and bear in mind the link
between Iran and Hezbollah; bear in mind the exhortations from the
Iranian President that Israel should be destroyed and wiped off the map
\-- you can understand the tenacity with which the Israelis have
responded.7 He was echoed by a former head of the Australian Department
of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who sought to refute arguments that the
real source of the conflict lay with Israel\'s colonial policies in Gaza
and the West Bank. His view was that \'the Palestinian issue cannot be
resolved because a significant part of the Arab and Muslim world still
do not accept Israel\'s right to exist\...Until this changes, Israel
will remain as it has for 60 years: under siege.\'8 The darker edge to
such viewpoints was added by an Israeli Air Force Colonel taking
journalists on a tour of Hatzor airbase, who stated that: \'My mother is
a survivor of the Holocaust\...I know that at other times in our
history, when we did not have a state, or any force to defend ourselves,
things happened in a different way.\'9 [Thus war and existence are
intertwined]{.underline}. However [within such existential imperatives
to war lies a more technical, performative (and thus rationalistic)
discourse: that once it is deemed necessary to use force in defence of
one\'s right to exist it is possible to do so, to translate military
means into political ends in a controlled and rational way. This is the
second, rationalist form of state reason that most commonly takes the
name of \'strategy\'.]{.underline} Its fundamental tenet was most
famously expressed in Carl Von Clausewitz\'s argument [that war \'is a
mere continuation of policy by other means\...a pulsation of violent
force\...subject to the will of a guiding intelligen]{.underline}ce\'.10
That this is a textbook model of instrumental reason, one that imports
Newtonian physics into human relations, is clear in Clausewitz\'s
influential definition: \'War is an act of force to compel our enemy to
do our will\'.11 This purposive rationality is expressed by the Israeli
war plan for Lebanon, long in preparation, to which we are not privy. We
can however deduce from the IDF\'s campaign that it had the objective of
confronting Hezbollah: degrading their ability to operate, coercing them
to hand over the two captured Israeli soldiers and, indirectly, coercing
the Lebanese government into disarming Hezbollah and removing them from
southern Lebanon. Other officials stated that the complete destruction
of Hezbollah was their objective. It is telling that at the cessation of
hostilities none of these objectives had been fully achieved.12 The
IDF\'s chosen weapons, until the last few days when a limited ground
operation was conducted, were F-16s and artillery strikes deployed
against Hezbollah offices and facilities along with crucial
infrastructure, and against civilians in their homes and vehicles. The
doctrinal influences appeared to be Clausewitz and the generation of
twentieth century airpower theorists such as Guilio Douhet. Douhet
believed that command of the air would ensure victory \'all down the
line\'; he argued that \'modern warfare allows for no distinction
between combatants and noncombatants\' and, in one analyst\'s
paraphrase, that nations must \'at the outset be prepared to launch
massive bombing attacks against the enemy centres of population,
government and industry \-- hit first and hit hard to shatter enemy
civilian morale, leaving the enemy government no option but to sue for
peace\'.13 [The mechanistic quality of their thinking was captured in
the statements of Israeli officials that they have struck \'1,000
targets in the last eight days, 20 per cent missile launching sites,
control and command centers, missiles and so forth\'14]{.underline} and
that \'we are still working through our original targeting menus\'.15 An
International Institute of Strategic Studies\' commentary, working again
from within the Clausewitzian frame, suggested that [\'Israel will
acquire gains well worth the price\'16 \-- but that crude calculus of
costs and benefits must be set against the enormous loss of civilian
life in Lebanon, the hundreds of thousands of refugees, the billions in
property and environmental damage, and the inspiration to a new wave of
international terrorism. Both the Israeli government and the Hezbollah
leadership claimed victory, but the dead may disagree.]{.underline} Two
Ontologies of War This essay [develops a theory about the causes of war
\-- and thus aims to generate lines of action and critique for peace \--
that cuts beneath analyses based either on a given sequence of events,
threats, insecurities and political manipulation, or]{.underline} the
play of institutional, economic or political interests ([the
\'military-industrial complex\']{.underline}). Such factors are
important to be sure, and should not be discounted, but they flow over a
deeper bedrock of modern reason that has not only come to form a
powerful structure of common sense but the apparently solid ground of
the real itself. [In this light, the two \'existential\' and
\'rationalist\' discourses of war-making and justification mobilised in
the Lebanon war are more than merely arguments, rhetorics or even
discourses]{.underline}. Certainly they mobilise forms of knowledge and
power together; providing political leaderships, media, citizens,
bureaucracies and military forces with organising systems of belief,
action, analysis and rationale. [But they run deeper than that. They are
truth-systems of the most powerful and fundamental kind that we have in
modernity: ontologies, statements about truth and being which claim a
rarefied privilege to state what is and how it must be maintained as it
is.]{.underline} I am thinking of ontology in both its senses: ontology
as both a statement about the nature and ideality of being (in this case
political being, that of the nation-state), and as a statement of
epistemological truth and certainty, of methods and processes of
arriving at certainty (in this case, the development and application of
strategic knowledge for the use of armed force, and the creation and
maintenance of geopolitical order, security and national survival).
These derive from the classical idea of ontology as a speculative or
positivistic inquiry into the fundamental nature of truth, of being, or
of some phenomenon; the desire for a solid metaphysical account of
things inaugurated by Aristotle, an account of \'being qua being and its
essential attributes\'.17 In contrast, drawing on Foucauldian theorising
about truth and power, I see ontology as a particularly powerful claim
to truth itself: a claim to the status of an underlying systemic
foundation for truth, identity, existence and action; one that is not
essential or timeless, but is thoroughly historical and contingent, that
is deployed and mobilised in a fraught and conflictual socio-political
context of some kind. In short, ontology is the \'politics of truth\'18
in its most sweeping and powerful form. I see such a drive for
ontological certainty and completion as particularly problematic for a
number of reasons. Firstly, when it takes the form of the existential
and rationalist ontologies of war, it amounts to a hard and exclusivist
claim: a drive for ideational hegemony and closure that limits debate
and questioning, that confines it within the boundaries of a particular,
closed system of logic, one that is grounded in the truth of being, in
the truth of truth as such. The second is its intimate relation with
violence: [the dual ontologies represent a simultaneously social and
conceptual structure that generates violence. Here we are witness to an
epistemology of violence (strategy) joined to an ontology of violence
(the national security state). When we consider their relation to war,
the two ontologies are especially dangerous because each alone (and
doubly in combination) tends both to quicken the resort to war and to
lead to its escalation either in scale and duration, or in unintended
effects]{.underline}. In such a context violence is not so much a tool
that can be picked up and used on occasion, at limited cost and with
limited impact \-- [it permeates being.]{.underline} This essay
describes firstly the ontology of the national security state (by way of
the political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes, Carl Schmitt and G. W. F.
Hegel) and secondly the rationalist ontology of strategy (by way of the
geopolitical thought of Henry Kissinger), showing how they crystallise
into a mutually reinforcing system of support and justification,
especially in the thought of Clausewitz. [This creates both a profound
ethical and pragmatic problem. The ethical problem arises because of
their militaristic force \-- they embody and reinforce a norm of war \--
and because they enact what Martin Heidegger calls an \'enframing\'
image of technology and being in which humans are merely utilitarian
instruments for use, control and destruction, and force \-- in the words
of one famous Cold War strategist \-- can be thought of as a \'power to
hurt\'.19 The pragmatic problem arises because force so often produces
neither the linear system of effects imagined in strategic theory nor
anything we could meaningfully call security, but rather turns in upon
itself in a nihilistic spiral of pain and destruction]{.underline}. In
the era of a \'war on terror\' dominantly conceived in Schmittian and
Clausewitzian terms,20 the arguments of Hannah Arendt (that violence
collapses ends into means) and Emmanuel Levinas (that \'every war
employs arms that turn against those that wield them\') take on added
significance. Neither, however, explored what occurs when war and being
are made to coincide, other than Levinas\' intriguing comment that in
war persons \'play roles in which they no longer recognises themselves,
making them betray not only commitments but their own substance\'. 21
What I am trying to describe in this essay is a complex relation
between, and interweaving of, epistemology and ontology. But it is not
my view that these are distinct modes of knowledge or levels of truth,
because in the social field named by security, statecraft and violence
they are made to blur together, continually referring back on each
other, like charges darting between electrodes. Rather they are related
systems of knowledge with particular systemic roles and intensities of
claim about truth, political being and political necessity. Positivistic
or scientific claims to epistemological truth supply an air of
predictability and reliability to policy and political action, which in
turn support larger ontological claims to national being and purpose,
drawing them into a common horizon of certainty that is one of the
central features of past-Cartesian modernity. Here it may be useful to
see ontology as a more totalising and metaphysical set of claims about
truth, and epistemology as more pragmatic and instrumental; but while a
distinction between epistemology (knowledge as technique) and ontology
(knowledge as being) has analytical value, it tends to break down in
action. The epistemology of violence I describe here (strategic science
and foreign policy doctrine) claims positivistic clarity about
techniques of military and geopolitical action which use force and
coercion to achieve a desired end, an end that is supplied by the
ontological claim to national existence, security, or order. However in
practice[, technique quickly passes into ontology.]{.underline} This it
does in two ways. First, [instrumental violence is married to an
ontology of insecure national existence which itself admits no
questioning. The nation and its identity are known and essential, prior
to any conflict, and the resort to violence becomes an equally essential
predicate of its perpetuation]{.underline}. In this way
knowledge-as-strategy claims, in a positivistic fashion, to achieve a
calculability of effects (power) for an ultimate purpose (securing
being) that it must always assume. Second[, strategy as a technique not
merely becomes an instrument of state power but ontologises itself in a
technological image of \'man\' as a maker and user of things, including
other humans, which have no essence or integrity outside their value as
objects]{.underline}. In Heidegger\'s terms, technology becomes being;
epistemology immediately becomes technique, immediately being. This
combination could be seen [in the aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon war,
whose obvious strategic failure for Israelis generated fierce attacks on
the army and political leadership and forced the resignation of the IDF
chief of staff. Yet in its wake neither ontology was
rethought]{.underline}. Consider how a reserve soldier, while on
brigade-sized manoeuvres in the Golan Heights in early 2007, was quoted
as saying: \'we are ready for the next war\'. Uri Avnery quoted Israeli
commentators explaining the rationale for such a war as being to
\'eradicate the shame and restore to the army the \"deterrent power\"
that was lost on the battlefields of that unfortunate war\'[. In
\'Israeli public discourse\',]{.underline} he remarked[, \'the next war
is seen as a natural phenomenon, like tomorrow\'s
sunrise.\']{.underline} 22 The danger obviously raised here is that
[these dual ontologies of war link being, means, events and decisions
into a single, unbroken chain whose very process of construction cannot
be examined]{.underline}. As is clear in the work of Carl Schmitt,
[being implies action, the action that is war. This chain is also
obviously at work in the U.S. neoconservative doctrine]{.underline} that
argues, as Bush did in his 2002 West Point speech, that \'the only path
to safety is the path of action\', which begs the question of whether
strategic practice and theory can be detached from strong ontologies of
the insecure nation-state.23 This is the direction taken by much realist
analysis critical of Israel and the Bush administration\'s \'war on
terror\'.24 Reframing such concerns in Foucauldian terms, we could argue
that obsessive ontological commitments have led to especially disturbing
\'problematizations\' of truth.25 However such rationalist critiques
rely on a one-sided interpretation of Clausewitz that seeks to
disentangle strategic from existential reason, and to open up choice in
that way. However without interrogating more deeply how they form a
conceptual harmony in Clausewitz\'s thought \-- and thus in our dominant
understandings of politics and war \-- tragically violent \'choices\'
will continue to be made. The essay concludes by pondering a normative
problem that arises out of its analysis: if the divisive ontology of the
national security state and the violent and instrumental vision of
\'enframing\' have, as Heidegger suggests, come to define being and
drive \'out every other possibility of revealing being\', how can they
be escaped?26 How can other choices and alternatives be found and
enacted? How is there any scope for agency and resistance in the face of
them? Their social and discursive power \-- one that aims to take up the
entire space of the political \-- needs to be respected and understood.
However, we are far from powerless in the face of them. [The need is to
critique dominant images of political being and dominant ways of
securing that being at the same time, and to act and choose such that we
bring into the world a more sustainable, peaceful and non-violent global
rule of the political.]{.underline}

### Impact -- Permanent War

#### **Security operates through a system of permanent warfare that proliferates planetary dangers to fuel the demand for catastrophe. This system makes their impacts inevitable and ignores ongoing structural violence** 

**Masco 2014** (Joseph, is Professor of Anthropology at the University
of Chicago; "The Theater of Operations"; Duke University Press; 193-200)

Because the terrorist threat continues, the national emergency declared
on September 14, 2001, and the powers and authorities adopted to deal
with that emergency must continue in effect beyond September 14, 2011.
Therefore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national
emergency. **---PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, "NOTICE FROM THE PRESIDENT
REGARDING THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO
CERTAIN TERRORIST ATTACKS"** The President is authorized to use all
necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or
persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the
terrorist attack that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such
organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of
international terrorism against the United States by such nations,
organizations or persons. **---U.S. CONGRESS, "AUTHO- RIZATION FOR USE
OF MILITARY FORCE," SEPTEMBER 12, 2001** [In the first decade of its
twenty-first-century emergency, the U.S. security state did nothing less
than reinvent itself, imagining and pursuing a new planetary concept of
American power or- ganized around the anticipation and pursuit of
terror. The end- less futurity of terror (existing, imagined, emergent)
transforms defense into a war that is boundless in both time and space
and that is constantly evolving.]{.underline} [The now annual
presidential notice to Congress that the emergency provoked by the
attacks on Sep- tember 11, 2001, continues]{.underline}, endows the
country's chief executive with wartime powers, [creating a global
theater of operations for the ever emerging U.S. counterterror state
apparatus.1 It is also a means of suspending democratic institutions to
enable radical forms of state agency in the hope of eliminating terrors,
both real and imagined. What began as]{.underline} an international
response to the suicide-hijacker attacks on New York and Washington
organized by a small group identified as [Al Qaeda has evolved into an
American vision of planetary engagement]{.underline} that is aston-
ishingly productive and wide-ranging---constituting simultaneously a new
geopolitics and a new domestic social contract. In the name of
existential defense, security experts across a vast range of fields and
agencies spend each day trying to anticipate and preempt dangers from
the future---hoping to eliminate surprise and thereby engineer a world
without events. Multi- disciplinary, creative, hyperactive,
gloomy---this counterterror state appa- ratus imagines a world without
borders but filled with proliferating forms of terror (present,
contingent, projected, imagined). It engages the future as a space of
endless logistical need, where the spectrum of possible dan- gers
requires ever new and expanding analytics, institutions, technologies,
and forms of mobility. In this way, the counterterror state is not
fighting a specific war that could be won or lost. Instead, it seeks to
install technical capacities into the future to deal with terroristic
threats both known and unknown, those expected and those not yet
visible. [As part of this expand- ing economy of counterterror, security
experts are increasingly endowed with the power to imagine---and
create---new forms of danger to engineer countermeasures to combat them.
Thus, counterterror becomes terror becomes counterterror in a recursive
system of anticipatory preemption, which focuses experts on engaging
potential existential dangers---the what ifs---rather than on simply
rebuilding and expanding nonmilitary Ameri- can, and international,
infrastructures.]{.underline} In the proliferation of dangers and expert
calls to build new capacities to meet them, [it is easy to miss the fact
that counterterror is naturalized as a permanent war]{.underline} (based
on merging real, contingent, and imaginative practices). [Indeed, war
has become so deeply installed in everyday Amer- ican life in the first
decade of counterterror that it is no longer actually "war": the ongoing
U.S. military actions (from troops, to special forces, to drone strikes)
in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Iraq at the start of the second
decade of counterterror are officially referred to as "overseas con-
tingency operations.]{.underline}"2 By reframing the longest-running
military actions in U.S. history as simply "overseas contingencies,"
[the violence once known as war is remade as part of a larger species of
planetary governance (merging military, humanitarian, drug enforcement,
and disaster relief activities), becoming radically open-ended,
multifronted, and politically diffuse]{.underline}. This reframing
naturalizes U.S. military engagements across scales and types as simply
another mode of international relations and announces that---since
contingencies are, after all, contingent (articulating radically
different pos- sibilities of what might or might not happen)---[the
security state claims both near-term and deep future horizons for
counterterror.]{.underline} For when can the contingent ever be truly
defeated? How can one ever be fully prepared for the radically emergent?
How does one dispel forever what *might* happen--- let alone permanently
and knowingly eliminate the worst-case scenarios of mushroom clouds,
biological attacks, and terrorists armed with wmds? [Counterterror is,
in a key cultural sense, one logical multigenerational outcome of the
contradictions installed in American society by the atomic
bomb]{.underline}, a technology that remade the United States as a
global superpower but did so only through the systematic application of
nuclear terror---directly in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, geopolitically via
the Cold War nuclear arms race, and affectively in the domestic form of
U.S. civil defense. [The national security state was empowered,
organized, and psychosocially infused with nuclear terror from day one.
Officials have relied on the existential threat of nuclear war for a
wide range of projects since the destruction of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.]{.underline} Indeed, the national security state was formally
established in 1947 to prevent a nuclear Pearl Harbor, and to advance
the interna- tional power of the United States as a nuclear superpower.
This new kind of security state used nuclear fear writ large to
transform domestic U.S. security into a global project with far-reaching
economic, military, and political consequences. As a mode of global
governance, however, the re- sulting Cold War balance of terror was
always unstable in one key domain, as it required two superpower states
locked in perpetual competition and equally committed to avoiding
nuclear war from one minute to the next via nuclear deterrence. The War
on Terror solves the structural problem of an unstable bipolarity (and
specifically the potential loss of a stabilizing enemy other) by
bypassing contemporary politics altogether (i.e., reliance on a specific
named other to combat in perpetuity) and claiming the future itself as
the domain it needs to secure. [The counterterror state draws its power
from identifying a proliferating field of potential dangers on a plan-
etary scale and then attempting to build a security state capable of
respond- ing to each contingency. Just note the proliferation of new
securities in the past decade---homeland security, biosecurity, and
cybersecurity---each of which is composed of a new universe of experts
and objects that require a complex, global vision of American power
combined with innovative modes of threat assessment and
response.]{.underline} Each of these fields also enables new degrees and
forms of militarism, merging new offensive and defensive capabilities
through threat designation and affective governance. A con- cern about
securing the U.S. homeland, for example, accompanies an ex- panding U.S.
campaign of drone bombing in the homelands of Pakistanis, Yemenis, and
Somalians (in countries with which the United States is not formally "at
war"). The biosecurity apparatus, as I have argued, is not just
preparing for infectious disease outbreaks within the United States but
is researching future bioweapons and using disease eradication campaigns
as a cover for covert operations on a global scale. The new official
concern about domestic cybersecurity is tied directly to U.S. cyberwar
campaigns (most publicly against Iranian nuclear facilities) as well as
unprecedented forms of digital surveillance (as the National Security
Agency now captures the bulk of all global digital communications in the
name of counterter- rorism, but also spies on government officials and
conducts corporate es- pionage around the world). Importantly, the
counterterror state pursues technical capacities for the sake of new
forms of future agency and is, thus, itself radically emergent. [This
commitment to constant revolutionary change across experts,
technologies, and administrative abilities is perhaps the chief
accomplishment of the counterterror state and why it will likely have
such a deep hold on the twenty-first century. Moreover, counterterror is
not only a highly flexible mode of security, based on an ever-expanding
concept of terror and a highly elastic set of core concerns]{.underline}
in the figuration of the wmd. It also addresses an unwinna- ble problem,
for when can one say that terror---a basic emotional state---has been
finally purged from American experience? [Counterterror colonizes the
American future by identifying an ever-shifting series of peoples, ob-
jects, technologies, hypotheticals, and contingencies to secure in the
name of planetary defense.]{.underline} The fact that very few of these
potentials (people, tech- nologies, finances, microbes) can be perfectly
secured on a global basis in practice is part of the recursive structure
of counterterror, as both failure and surprise drive [increasing calls
for new capacities, increasing securi- tization, and more aggressive
militarization]{.underline}. Counterterror, thus, thrives on a
proliferating insecurity, using vulnerability (past, present, future)
and imaginative creativity (scenarios, fears, nightmares) as its raison
d'être. In this regard, [counterterror is the perfect conceptual vehicle
for a permanent mobilization of the security state. Infused with
proliferating images of exis- tential danger to be fought in perpetuity,
counterterror is highly flexible in its core goals, objects, techniques,
and future ambitions.]{.underline} The transformations in American
society during the first decade of ter- ror politics could not be more
profound: counterterror has produced a new social contract not through
open political deliberation (there has been almost no formal debate
about alternative notions of security and costs) but through the
constant amplification of threats. Indeed, [the War on Ter- ror has
fundamentally shifted American values, with the well-publicized illegal
practices]{.underline} of the Bush administration (rendition, indefinite
deten- tion, torture, and domestic surveillance) enhanced by the Obama
admin- istration's imperial commitment to cyberwar, digital
surveillance, and a global "targeted killing" (that is, assassination)
program using both Spe- cial Forces and drones (see also Constitution
Project 2013; Open Society Foundation 2013; Becker and Shane 2012;
Sanger 2012). [Counterterror has trumped human rights and law at every
turn in the first decade of the War on Terror, raising very basic
questions about U.S. support for international law, the rights of U.S.
citizens, and the limits of war in the twenty-first
century.]{.underline} The coherence of these policies across the Bush
and Obama administrations and the absence of any substantial effort by
Con- gress or the Department of Justice to adjudicate practices such as
water boarding, indefinite detention, warrantless surveillance, and the
killing of U.S. citizens and others with drone attacks are powerful
indications of the new counterterror consensus in Washington.3 As I have
argued in this book, [the United States has historically expanded its
security apparatus not through careful deliberation but rather in times
of national panic]{.underline}. [The War on Terror, however, is unique,
in that it is a conflict that cannot be bounded spatially or temporally,
or won. For example, even if Al Qaeda were eliminated from the planet,
that would not be the end of U.S. coun- terterror because the global
future is now seen as the ultimate domain to secure. This notion of
planetary security, as I have argued, is highly nation- alist in
orientation and thus remains at odds with collective emergencies like
climate change that cannot be easily militarized for national advan-
tage]{.underline}. Thus, counterterror, despite its proliferating
objects of concern and expansive imaginative practices of threat
designation, does not recognize all terrors, or even all of the most
immediate and challenging ones. Antici- patory preemption works to
relocate the domain of security from the ma- terial world of everyday
precarity into the collective imaginary, as experts conjure up images of
perfected terrors that overwhelm all lesser but lived experiences of
insecurity, displacing governance from existing forms of violence,
suffering, and crisis in favor of combating nightmarish, if largely
speculative, *what ifs*. [As a result, counterterror has dominated the
United States politically, socially, and financially]{.underline} in the
early twenty-first century, a period of multi- plying crises across
capital, environment, and public institutions. Though the country is not
confronted by a high-tech, nuclear-armed, global ad- versary like the
Soviet Union, the Pentagon's current annual budget is over 50 percent
higher than its average budget during the Cold War (Harrison 2011). The
military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq are the longest wars in U.S.
history and have so far cost at least \$1.3 trillion; only World War II
was a more expensive conflict (Belasco 2011; Daggett 2010, 2). By 2012
those who orchestrated the 2001 attacks (including Osama bin Laden and
his chief lieutenants in Al Qaeda) were dead or in prison, but yearly
U.S. national security expenditures remain at an all-time high (Hellman
2011), with no change in sight. The cost of the first decade of the War
on Terror certainly exceeds \$7.6 trillion (National Priorities Project
2011). This expen- diture comes in the midst of recurring global
economic crises (including a 2008 recession second in severity only to
the Great Depression of the 1930s) that wiped out twenty years of
accumulated wealth for the median U.S. household (Appelbaum 2012).
Despite these startling economic facts, the national security system is
not subject to calls for substantial economic re- form and remains
virtually immune to political criticism or review from elected officials
of both major parties. Indeed, counterterror has been the primary growth
industry in the United States in the early twenty-first century. New
national infrastruc- tures of homeland security, biosecurity, and
cybersecurity sit on top of the national security institutions built
during the Cold War, already the larg- est national security apparatus
in the world. The emerging counterterror infrastructure is staffed with
experts and administrators leading lives that are classified secrets: in
2011, over 4.8 million Americans possessed a secu- rity clearance (U.S.
Office of the Director of National Intelligence 2012, 3). The cost of
maintaining government secrets is correspondingly at an all- time high,
increasing 12 percent in 2011 alone, to reach a total of \$11.3 billion
(U.S. Information Security Oversight Office 2012, 3). The American
commitment to militarization takes many forms, including maintaining a
global system of over a thousand foreign military bases (Vine 2009, 42;
see also Lutz 2009) and monopolizing two-thirds of the global arms trade
(Shanker 2009). Increasingly, U.S. police departments have also been
pulled into the national counterterror apparatus, participating in the
yearly simu- lations of terrorist attacks while expanding capabilities
via access to federal counterterror funds. Since 2001 rural as well as
urban police departments have armed themselves with everything from
military-grade weapons and bomb-detecting robots to drones in
anticipation of wmd attacks but di- rected increasingly against everyday
forms of crime and social protest. To this spectrum of official
counterterror agents, we could add the host of new experts in
counterterrorism, wmd emergency response, homeland security, and
biosecurity that are being produced in universities and col- leges, with
at least 350 new degree-granting programs in the United States alone.4
These academic programs join the twelve "centers of excellence" funded
by the 2002 Homeland Security Act, which link hundreds of edu- cational
institutions via counterterror, training new experts in terrorist risk
assessment, microbial hazards, zoonotic disease defense, food safety,
cata- strophic event response, explosives, immigration, coastal
security, trans- portation, and security visualization sciences.5 These
public counterterror training programs, of course, supplement the vast
classified efforts in the Department of Defense and across the U.S.
intelligence agencies---creating a new and highly redundant world of
public, corporate, military, and clas- sified counterterror expertise.6
*Expertise*, as we have seen, is a crucial aspect of the *critical
infrastructure* concept. [Counterterror has produced a new competitive
terrain across corporate, academic, military, intelligence, and
scientific institutions for threat identification, anticipation, and
response. Indeed, few contemporary social institutions or national
infrastructures are not in some direct way now embedded within the
larger U.S. counterterror state apparatus.7 In one sense this is a very
American mode of security, a broad mobiliza- tion of social institutions
to engage an emerging national danger as first happened during the Cold
War.]{.underline} What is new is the radical open-endedness of the
concept of terror, its claim on a deep future, and---precisely because
anticipatory preemption is an imaginative enterprise---its
self-colonizing nature. During the Cold War, one could debate what was
the right balance of technological systems (missiles, warheads, bombers,
submarines) to en- sure global nuclear deterrence. In a counterterror
state, there can never be enough security, as threat is a potentiality
without limit, capable of producing endless new experiences of
anticipated menace and danger. [Counterter- ror, therefore, involves
linking infrastructures of militarism, technoscience, surveillance, and
affect in a constantly emerging fusion of imagination, an- ticipation,
preemption, and violence. It constantly enfolds new domains--- policing,
border patrols, public health, transportation, computing, and
finance---and reorients them toward specific feared outcomes by
constitut- ing a field of terror that is ever expanding and affectively
overpowering. In this way, counterterror has quickly become the
organizing principle for the U.S. security state, a vast set of
institutions and experts who seek to address the problem of future
violence by trying to engineer the global present.]{.underline}

### [Impact -- Preemption]{.underline} 

#### This investment in securitization sustains an affective economy of perpetual preemptive warfare 

**Massumi '14** (Brian Massumi, professor in the Communication
Department of the University of Montreal, 2013-2014, "The Remains of the
Day," *On Violence* Volume 1, modified)

To help answer our questions, [preemption can\'t be thought of as simply
a doctrine. Doctrines change as political actors and institutions turn
over]{.underline}. Preemption was a doctrine -- in the aftermath of
9-11, it became the stated war doctrine of the George W Bush
administration. [But as a formative historical force with a power to
regather itself and follow its own momentum, it overflowed the Bush
administration and flowed into the Obama administration, and will likely
flow beyond it.]{.underline} In addition, [it can be argued that it
overflowed the borders of the United States, going global]{.underline}.

[Preemption in this sense is a tendency that cannot be reduced to a
time- and place-specific doctrine. Tendencies are
self-propagating]{.underline}. They have a power to repeat their
operations in different times and places. Doctrines must be applied.
[Tendencies are self-applying. They are self-driving]{.underline}. This
makes them a force to be contended within their own right

[The question, then, is how preemption constitutes a self-driving
tendency that has to be construed as a force of history passing through
shifts in doctrine and changes in casts of characters.]{.underline}

We\'ll start from the way preemption was formulated as a doctrine by
George W Bush in response to the 9-11 attacks \-- and then consider how
what was encapsulated in that doctrine took on a momentum of its own.

This is the doctrine, Bush\'s own words: \"If we wait for threats to
fully materialize, we will have waited too long. [We must take the
battle to the enemy]{.underline}, disrupt his plans and confront the
worst threats before they emerge. In the world we have entered, [the
only path to safety is the path to action.\"]{.underline}

Now some might actually see this as an example of \"the more things
change, the more they stay the same,\" because the right to preemptive
attack has been a part of the practice of war for as long as there have
been wars, and is a part of classical war theory and the law of war.
However, [in the past, preemptive attack was considered justified in
response to \"a clear and present danger]{.underline}.\" [the Bush
doctrine changed danger to threat]{.underline}.

[The first thing this does is shift the emphasis to the affective
register]{.underline}. A clear and present danger is observable and in
principle objectively verifiable, whereas [a threat only has to be felt
to be.]{.underline} [It has a visceral reality that is
self-confirming]{.underline}. [If you feel threatened, you
are]{.underline} -- end of story. On 9-11 we felt it.

Although formalized as a State doctrine, [preemption establishes a
direct relation to life at its most visceral level]{.underline}. In
other words, [to affect -- to what hits us in the gut so immediately
that all we can do is reel, not yet reflect, not yet knowing how to act
in response]{.underline}. Affect at this level of the visceral hit that
suspends considered reflection and momentarily ~~paralyzes~~ \[stifles\]
action isn\'t what we normally think about as emotion. Through a
triggering event like 9-11, [it hits collectively, directly riveting a
whole population to a situation it is not yet capable of
categorizing]{.underline}. It braces us together in uncertainty, in the
terror of not yet being able to answer the question, \"what just
happened?\" [Unlike an emotion, affect at this level it is less
something we each have personally, than it is something that has us
collectively]{.underline}. [We are taken up together in the
terror.]{.underline} We are vaulted into it together. We are agape, in
suspense together. [We are all in it together, in the disorientation of
terror. We are swept up by it. We are moved by it]{.underline}

[Preemption establishes a direct link between the institutional level of
policy -- the formal level of collective organization \-- and the
informal affective level of sweeping collective disorientation and
agitated]{.underline} ~~paralysis~~ \[[inaction]{.underline}\]. With
preemption, this political link to the level of affective immediacy
becomes a motor of what happens. It goes off and running. [It sets in
motion an historical tendency that is difficult to put the brakes on
once it starts]{.underline}. That tendency has a certain logic of its
own.

I\'m not saying that the connection of politics to a visceral level
where reflection is momentarily suspended makes politics simply
irrational. I\'m saying that it gives preemption a logic of its own, and
that to understand what changed on 9-11, and how it stays the same the
more it changes, [we have to understand that logic, and what\'s
different about it.]{.underline}

There is something else that happens with preemption. There is another
significant shift, this one concerning time. Classically, a preemptive
attack is justified when there is \"a clear and present danger.\" [But
threat inhabits the future.]{.underline} Threats don\'t clearly present
themselves. [They vaguely loom, and their looming casts a shadow on the
present.]{.underline} [A threat is how an uncertain future
makes-itself-felt in the present.]{.underline} This has immediate
consequences on the plane of action. Even in ~~paralysis~~ \[inaction\],
it can change how we will be disposed to act. [This viscerally felt,
affective presence of an uncertain future has consequences for the
future. In a weird way, threat is a way in which the future affects
itself]{.underline}.

What I\'ve just described is like a time-loop. [The future comes back to
the present to trigger a reaction that jolts the present back to the
future, along a different path of action than would have eventuated
otherwise]{.underline}. Threat is a strange animal: a future cause. [It
comes from the future, to act on the futurity from which it
came]{.underline}. In a sense, [threat makes future
self-causing]{.underline}. [There is a kind of short-circuit in
time]{.underline}. [A future cause (the looming of the threat) loops
through affect in a way that effectively changes what goes
down]{.underline}. Threat loops through affect to effect, never
surrendering the future tense.

By contrast, the classical doctrine of preemption as it was understand
pre-9-11 specifically referred to danger, not threat, as already
mentioned. Danger involves the linear relationship between cause and
effect that we are used to dealing with in our common-sense everyday
lives. A situation clearly presents itself; its objective
characteristics are analyzed; the analysis suggests reasonable paths of
action; a direction is chosen, and the present marches the straight and
narrow path to the future, as dictated by the decision. The effects of
the decision flow logically, step-bystep from it. Of course [all kinds
of accidents can happen. The path can be miscalculated. The
deliberations can be flawed, the implementation flubbed]{.underline}.
But the point remains that [there is an assumption that decisions
affecting the future can be based on objectively verifiable, empirically
present conditions, and that political response begins with deliberation
and is guided by it.]{.underline} Here, the causes of things precede
them in time. Their effects feed forward from the empirical past,
through the observable present, and if all goes well, into a better
future. [It\'s all nicely ordered, comfortably linear.]{.underline}

[All of this gets seriously twisted by threat]{.underline}. Because,
once again, [it\'s enough for a threat to be felt to make it
real]{.underline}. [It needs no objective validation to have an effect
as a future cause. It doesn\'t operate in the realm of the
objective]{.underline}. [The future is precisely what is not yet
objectively present]{.underline}. [It\'s not empirically
observable]{.underline}. Preemption operates in the realm of affect. Its
concern is threat. If it is enough for threat to be felt for it to be
real and effective, then it\'s logical that the actions that effectively
flow from the feeling of threat are going to be justified affectively as
well. With preemption, the justification for actions, the legitimation
of political decision, tends to become fundamentally affective. It is
reasonable to say that a shift of this magnitude marks a threshold where
\"everything changes.\" [It\'s the death knell of centuries of politics
that were supposed to be guided by the \"reason of State.\"]{.underline}

To get a sense of how this works, consider Bush\'s well-known rationales
for invading Iraq: 1) Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction; 2)
Iraq was a haven for Al-Qaeda and would be used as a launching pad for
further attacks.

The first rationale was vigorously discounted at the time by people
objectively a position to know, such as UN weapons inspector Hans Blix.
It was subsequently found to be entirely lacking any factual foundation.
What was Bush\'s response when he had to face up to the fact that he had
embarked on a costly war on objectively false premises? Did he apologize
for the thousands of allied lives lost? For the hundreds of thousands of
Iraqi lives lost? Did he admit having made a mistake? No, he reaffirmed
that his decision to invade had been right in spite of having no factual
basis. Because, he said, we can be certain that if Hussein had had
weapons of mass destruction, he would have used them. In a word, if he
could have, he would have. Maybe it\'s true he couldn\'t have then. But
had the US not invaded, he might have could-have later on.

[What threat does is shift the mode of political decision from the
objective to the conditional -- the \"could have / would have\" -- and
treat the conditional as a certainty]{.underline}. [And it is a
certainty -- affectively speaking.]{.underline} Bush certainly felt that
Hussein would have if he could have. This certainty is not an informed
judgment about a set of objective conditions. [It\'s a gut feeling that
there is a potential for something to happen]{.underline}. The thing is,
[it is impossible to disprove a potential]{.underline}. [Even if nothing
has happened years later, nothing is disproven, because it might still
happen years after that. There\'s nothing to say that it couldn\'t. No
one can know.]{.underline} The only certainty is that you have to act
now to do everything possible to preempt the potential. In the
vocabulary of Bush\'s Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, [the only
thing certain is that you have to \"go kinetic,\" even though you don\'t
really know and can\'t know and know you don\'t know.]{.underline} There
are known knowns, Rumsfeld famously said and there are known unknowns.
But in the post 9-11 era of threat and terror, [what we\'re dealing with
and have to act on are the \"unknown unknowns]{.underline}.\" As Bush
put it in the quote cited earlier, \"the only path to safety is the path
to action\" -- against threats have not yet emerged. What has not yet
emerged can be nothing other than an unknown unknown.

[The best way to act when faced with the unknown unknown of a felt
threat vaguely looming is ... quickly]{.underline}. Otherwise you may
have acted too late.\"We will have waited too long,\" Bush warned. [The
only way to act quickly on an unknown unknown is to act intuitively,
using the same \"gut feeling\" you used to
feel-thethreat-into-reality]{.underline}. Bush, it is well known, prided
himself on deciding with his guts. He once actually said he used his
advisors primarily as \"mood rings.\"

So not only does preemption locate our actions in a realm of affect; not
only does it politically legitimate actions affectively; it makes affect
what makes them. [All of this short-circuits objective assessment or
evidence-based reasoning]{.underline}. [Hair-trigger action]{.underline}
[replaces deliberation. Rapid-response tactical capabilities replace
considered strategy.]{.underline} Remember the outrage when members of
Bush\'s inner circle were quoted by investigative journalist Ron Suskind
ridiculing what they called the \"reality-based\" community. While
you\'re off deliberating all nice and civil about what\'s really real,
they said, we\'re busy making reality, in our gutsy, preemptive way. The
phrase \"reality-based\" was sarcastic. It\'s the height of illusion,
they were saying, to treat a looming threat as if it were a clear and
present danger that can be responded to in the old-fashioned way, as if
the world were still orderly and linear. [No, what\'s realistic is go
kinetic with utmost urgency]{.underline}. And when you do that, [you\'re
not sitting back reflecting on the reality, you\'re making it, you\'re
producing it.]{.underline}

How can an approach to decision-making based on vaguely looming
futurities that have not yet emerged, that are still in potential, that
as-yet exist only in the conditional, as would-haves and could-haves, in
a way that short-circuits the present of considered reflection into a
future time-loop -- how can that actually produce the real? How can
action legitimately bootstrap itself into reality, from a grounding in
affect and potential?

The answer is obvious if you think about the second rationale Bush gave
for going into Iraq. Iraq, he said, was a staging ground for Al Qaeda.
[Yes, the cynic might say. Iraq was a staging ground for Al Qaeda and
Al-Qaeda-like terrorist groupings -- but only after the invasion, and as
a direct result of that preemptive action]{.underline}. It was the US
invasion that created the conditions for AlQaeda to move in and
capitalize on the chaos and resentment the invasion unleashed. The
retort to that, following the logic of preemption, is simple. It
happened. That\'s the reality. Iraq did become a staging ground for
terrorrism -- which only goes to show that [the potential was there
after all]{.underline}.

### Impact -- Racialization 

#### History proves-- rhetoric with an overeager focus on national identity and suppression of otherness to further political goals paired with emphasis on security drives genocide and war. 

**Burke '06** (Anthony; Professor in Humanities and Social Sciences at
UNSW Canberra; "Beyond Security, Ethics and Violence: War Against the
Other"; Routledge; pgs. 107-110)

[The 1999 crisis between Australia and Indonesia had its roots in a
pattern of engagement and thinking developed during the Cold War, whose
basis 1011 was a **rigid and violent deployment of
identity**]{.underline}. [When Suharto came to prominence after the
so-called 'coup attempt' of October 1965, a powerful image of Australian
identity combined an intense anti-communism with 3111 the fear and
suspicion of Asia, present throughout Australia's colonial
history.]{.underline} While identity was still premised on a hostility
towards cultural, political and strategic images of the Other, this
previously monolithic image was fractured by strategic imperatives:
Asian trading partners and military allies were subsumed into an
economic and geopolitical image of the Same, which was nonetheless
destabilised by continuing anxieties about cultural difference. These
'friendly' forms of otherness, it was hoped, could be slowly modified to
allow for economic integration and the culti- vation of bourgeois forms
of life and desire; [the more threatening otherness represented by
left-wing and nationalist movements was simply to be **elim- inated,
however violently**.17]{.underline} [By the early 1960s the high hopes
aroused by Australia's support for Indonesia's independence had given
way to a situation in which Australia and other Western governments were
increasingly hostile to the regime of Indonesia's President Sukarno
because of his closeness to the Indonesian \\ Communist Party (PKI) and
the threat this posed to their strategic and economic interests in
Southeast Asia.]{.underline} Thus the Menzies and Holt govern- 30111
ments responded to the Indonesian army's takeover in 1965--6, during
which as many as a million people were slaughtered, with enormous relief
and admiration. [Australia would play a crucial role both in protecting
the 3 New Order's position in Indonesia, and in securing the broader
regional 4 order it had sanctioned. It was in this context, and the
uncertainty created 5 by Nixon's 1969 announcement that American ground
forces would never 6 again be deployed to Southeast Asia, that the
rhetoric of 'strange neigh- 7 bours' made an early
appearance.]{.underline} [An American strategic analyst, Kathryn 8
Young, wrote in 1970 that if a co-operative relationship between
Australia 9 and the New Order did not develop in the wake of American
failure in Vietnam, 'the **prospects for stability** in the wider
Southeast Asian area 1 **would become quite bleak'**.18]{.underline} 2
In this scenario serious conflicts of interest (and emotional
attachment) 3 would develop for Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia -- who
had deep 4 cultural, language and religious ties with Indonesia but
military, trade and political ties to Australia -- along with possible
great power involvement 111as tensions escalated. [Whatever the growing
warmth in relations between 2 Australia and the Suharto regime, Young
wrote, sensitivities over the 3 Papua New Guinea border and differences
in 'modes of thinking, value 4 systems, economies and forms of political
organisation' left the relation- 5 ship vulnerable to upheaval and
misunderstanding:]{.underline} 7 the usual factors making for a sense of
community, or even sympa- 8 thetic mutual relations, between two nations
are objectively absent in 9 this case. . . . Yet in spite of this
objective dissimilarity a recognised 1011 and increasingly understood
relationship has begun to develop.19 1 2 Thus the trope of strangeness
became integral to a potent blackmail 1 that portrayed the relationship
as a stabilising factor of 'global' signifi- 4 cance, in a newly
ambiguous and uncertain world. [A drive for sameness 5 coexisted with
continuing anxieties about differences, which Australian 6 policy in
particular now sought to reduce and manage.]{.underline} 7 Although a
latent possibility, such differences had not yet emerged 8 as a problem.
The vast slaughter that had accompanied the destruction of 9 the PKI's
social and political infrastructure, and the hundreds of thou- sands
still held without charge or trial, were more cause for relief than 1
concern; the regime had written a generous new foreign investment law, 2
was receiving millions of dollars from the new international aid consor-
3 tium, IGGI (Intergovernmental Group on Indonesia), and had engineered
4 a dramatic pro-Western reversal in foreign policy. Notwithstanding the
5 war in Vietnam, Suharto's regime seemed to have singlehandedly trans-
6 formed Southeast Asia into a bulwark of anti-communism and security. 7
Thus at this time strangeness displayed its Janus-face: growing mutual 8
assumptions of sameness and homogenisation. Assuming the theoretical 9
oneness of Western elites and their publics, the New Order regime took
for granted a broad Western acceptance of authoritarianism; for their
part 1 Western elites assumed a long-term convergence of values to match
2 Indonesia's integration with the international strategic and
capitalist order. 3 Gough Whitlam was moved to say that the region was
witnessing the 4 creation of 'a just and prosperous Indonesia . . . an
example to our neigh- 5 bourhood of progress and social
transformation'.20 6 [This shockingly benign image of the New Order was
also being i**ncorp- 7 orated** into a new Australian politics of
**nation-building and identity**]{.underline}. 8 [Whitlam assumed that
the New Order regime was **essential** to Australia's 9 **national
security**, and that acceptance by the New Order was crucial to the
cultivation of profitable and co-operative relations with a region that
1 retained recent memories of the White Australia policy and a
neo-colonial 2 war in Vietnam. Indeed in 1973 he told an audience that
'our **destiny is 3 inseparable** from Indonesia']{.underline}. This
cleaved, however strangely, with Labor's 4 claims for a new national
mission and identity: an Australia, as Whitlam told Suharto, committed
to 'social justice, human rights and peaceful regional co-operation',
'not open to suggestions of racism', and which 2 could now take 'her
rightful, proud, secure and independent place in the 3 future of our
region'.21 4 [At the same time the New Order was playing out a more
**repressive 5 politics of sameness**.]{.underline} [In 1949, with the
aim of welding thousands of islands 6 and numerous religions, languages
and cultures into a single nation, the 7 nationalists had declared the
national motto 'Unity In Diversity]{.underline}'. After 8 1966 the New
Order seized on this, and the five principles of the *Pancasila,* 9 in
an effort to subsume political and cultural differences beneath a
unifying model of identity that they could go on to re-interpret and
control.22 1 [However '**unity in diversity'** was bought at a
**frightening cost**: before 1970 2 the army fought uprisings and
rebellions in Central and West Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi, the Moluccas,
and faced strong resistance from the West 4 Papuans]{.underline}.
Likewise the fear engendered by the PKI's destruction remained 5 a
powerful (if rarely stated) factor in the tranquillisation of political
life. 6 [Only 18 months before Suharto's fall the slogan 'Satu Nusa,
Satu Bangsa, 7 Satu Bahasa, Indonesia' (**One Land, One People, One
Language, Indonesia)** 8 still hung triumphantly over Jakarta roadways
as a testament to the New 9 Order's **power over** national myths and
**institutions**]{.underline}. [These two drives for sameness converged
when Portugal announced its 4 intention to decolonise East Timor in
1974.]{.underline} At the same time the politics 5 of their suppression
of difference became more risky, and the contra- 6 dictions contained by
the idea of 'strange neighbours' more likely to erupt. 7 The Indonesian
army's paranoia about national unity and stability, and 8 its intense
hostility to the Left, ensured it would feel threatened by 9 the
emergence of Fretilin; likewise Cold War geopolitics saw the West turn a
blind eye to Indonesia's brutal December 1975 invasion. Having 1 argued
that Australia's very destiny lay with the New Order, Whitlam had 2 made
an 'Australian' politics of identity hostage to the generals' whims. 3
[In September 1974 he told Suharto of his preference for an Indonesian 4
rather than an independent East Timor]{.underline}. While he asserted
this should occur 5 peacefully, by the outbreak of civil war in August
1975 he had abandoned 6 this opposition to the Indonesian use of
force.23 [In the **most destructive** 7 way possible, East Timor had now
been incorporated into a **repressive** 8 Indonesian politics of
**sameness**, which the West **encouraged** in the cause 9 of its own
geopolitical drive for stability and identity. Australia's national
security was now wagered on the indivisible control 1 of the New Order
regime throughout the archipelago, **whatever its violence 2 and cost;**
likewise the pursuit of Australia's 'national interests' and the 3
ontological realisation of its larger project -- a renewed and
modernised 4 identity -- hinged on the preservation of its relationship
with the New Order.]{.underline} [The contradictions this would generate
were quickly visible, as the 1111 Fraser government -- pushed by
outraged public opinion -- **publicly 2 condemned** Indonesia's
full-scale invasion in December while **privately 3 showing
understanding**]{.underline}**.** After a meeting with Indonesian
foreign minister 4 Adam Malik six weeks after the invasion, Australian
foreign minister 5 Andrew Peacock said that 'differences of attitude . .
. should be seen in 6 the context of the long-term importance to both
countries and the region 7 as a whole of close and co-operative
relations'.24

### Alt -- Ontology of War

#### Vote neg to reject 1AC -- quick fix solutions like reform to arms sales policy obscures a structural analysis of global militarism. Our alternative rejects the aff in favor of constructing a new ontology of war that recognizes the recuperative nature of militarism in reforms such as the plan. Only an analysis of the structure of liberalism that problematizes academic investments like the 1ac is able to disrupt the grids of militarized subject formation 

**Barkawi and Brighton '11** (Tarak, Department of IR at University of
Cambridge, Shane, Department of IR at University of Sussex, "Powers of
War: Fighting, Knowledge, and Critique", International Political
Sociology (2011) 5, gender modified)

[So, what can be said of the ontology of war, that fundamental character
which manifests itself in each instance of war and is true of war in
general? As a phenomenon, war presents itself in historically specific
ways]{.underline} and most writing about it reflects this. Military
historians begin with the archive and the particularity of testimony.
[Strategic analysts attend to specific alignments of forces and the
effect of engagements on the course of a war. Those who experience a war
encounter its particular violences and their cumulative
impact]{.underline}. Despite this, [the question of the fundamental
character of war beyond its finite, historical manifestation recurs:
just as war poets frequently intimate transcendent human truth,
strategists and policy makers seek to recover eternal verities from
narratives of past battles and campaigns.]{.underline} [A proper
approach to the ontology of war does not seek to resolve this
discomforting tension, as though some decision were possible between
''war'' and ''wars'' as the correct object of inquiry. Rather, **we
propose to take it as a basic framework from which to
proceed**]{.underline}. We are not the first to do so. Clausewitz,
tellingly described as both historically specific to the point of
irrelevance (van Creveld 1991:ix; Kaldor 1999:13-30) and a source of
timeless insight (Gray 1999:75-112), also grapples with the universal
and the historically contingent character of war, what we call its
historicity. We consider his efforts below and mark the recurrence of
this conceptual tension in Etienne Balibar's recent work (Balibar 2008).
He discusses the continually transformative effect of ''this war''---the
war we are in or may be subject to---upon efforts to think about ''war''
as such. The historicity of war, in the first instance, consists of the
urgent grasp of ''this war'' on politics and society, of its ordering
effects on thought and knowledge about war. [What is it about ''this
war,'' most fundamentally, that demands attention to the exclusion of
other perspectives? Note a difference between accounts produced by
strategists, commanders, staff officers, soldier poets, and
memorialists, on the one hand, and much of the academic literature
mentioned earlier]{.underline}. [Participant perspectives, with varying
degrees of directness, center on fighting, past, current, or potential.
Fighting is that which thematically unifies war in general and in
particular---''war'' with ''wars''---and no ontology of war can exclude
it.]{.underline} [**Attention to fighting is that which marks out
war-centered analysis from that reducing war to a secondary effect.**
Fighting and the violence of war exercise a profound grasp on the
imagination, constituting the practical test to which strategic thought
is oriented and the conventional mode for the achievement of
victory]{.underline}. Fighting is dwelt upon in representations of war
in popular literature and cinema. Even Sun Tsu's aphorism that true
strategic excellence consists in ''\[subduing\] the enemy without
fighting'' (Sun 1971:77) derives its power from a paradoxical relation
to this basic truth, perhaps best articulated in Clausewitz's much
quoted observation that fighting is as definitive for war as cash
exchange for economy (Clausewitz 1976:97). [However, what fighting is,
how it might be understood and positioned within a fundamental theory of
war, cannot be taken for granted. Clearing the ground for a new ontology
of war requires recognition that fighting understood
instrumentally]{.underline}, as the Clausewitzian duel, the test of
arms, [as ''kinetic exchange,'' misses its wider implication and
importance]{.underline}. But as we saw above, fighting, or more broadly
military operations, is the site of a decisive divide in inquiry that
can be characterized as ''war or society,'' between a focus on war as
fighting and on its impact on society. The former's limitation of focus,
we suggest, is not an intellectual failure but, rather, an outcome of
the historicity of war. [**For those who focus on war as fighting, its
reality as an actual and potential presence compels an instrumental
relation to it, such that knowledge about war is never fully exterior to
an order war itself creates.** Fighting always entails the problem of
how to survive and prevail, and the question of the appropriate
instruments and means by which to do so occupies the minds of soldiers,
strategists, and political leaders who embark on war]{.underline}**.**
[**The question is what is occluded by such instrumentalization---by the
order of knowing and being war creates**---and what might be said of the
wider ontological significance of fighting?]{.underline} Economics as a
discipline after all has not been limited to or necessarily centered
upon the study of cash exchange. **[War studies as the study of
warfighting surely apprehends that most definitive of war, but rarely
escapes from the limits of historic particularity and thereby constrains
its own potential utility for a wider analysis of war]{.underline}**.
**[Fully developing our point about the instrumentalization that
fighting demands]{.underline}** would require attention to the broad and
disparate literatures concerning the experience of war and its effects,
something we do only in a limited fashion here. But it **[enables a
preliminary observation on the ontology of war: war is defined by
fighting or its immanent possibility and---as an historical,
existential, issue in the lives of those who seek to understand
it---this definitive element resists disinterested analysis, while
tending to instrumentalize knowledge about war.]{.underline}** One work
that describes the powerful grasp of war on thought is Emmanuel
Levinas's Totality and Infinity. An extended essay on the relationship
between ontology and ethics, Levinas's work begins from the proposition
that [the proximity between war and knowing is fundamental]{.underline},
asking rhetorically whether or not ''...lucidity, the mind's openness on
the true consist\[s\] in catching sight of the permanent possibility of
war?'' (Levinas 1969:21) His point is the pervasive, but not always
recognized or acknowledged, influence of war on knowledge, the ''truth''
of which functions within public rationality and institutions as a basis
for the flourishing and survival of the polity. War for such rationality
and institutions serves as a reality against which their truths are
tested. Despite dissimulations by political figures and official organs,
''the trial by force is the test of the real'': a point of vindication
or failure for those who might speak truth about the realities of war
(ibid.). So far, Levinas appears to offer an imperative for
instrumentalized strategic thought, for getting it right or facing ruin
on the battlefield. But he quickly goes further to suggest there can be
no rational comprehension of politics, no political calculation at all
without understanding how ''in advance \[war's\] shadow falls over the
actions of men.'' [Vitally**, this imbrication of war and truth goes
beyond the narrow framework of strategic thought and public
rationality**. That it does so is **revealed in the reality of war
itself, the violence of which ''does not consist so much in injuring and
annihilating persons as in interrupting their continuity, making them
play roles in which they no longer recognize themselves'' in ''an order
from which no one can keep \[their\] distance.'' While fighting remains
a kinetic exchange**]{.underline}, the Clausewitzian Schlacht, and the
most fundamental element of war, **[it is also an event and process with
the ability to draw in and disrupt wider certitudes and coordinates of
human life, to shape and accelerate the transitory and mutable in human
affairs. It is a ''casting into movement of beings hitherto anchored in
their identity... by an objective order from which there is no
escape...]{.underline}**'' (ibid.). War might, as Heraclitus tells us,
make kings, gods, and slaves, but it also retains the power to unmake
them, sometimes irrespective of their own actions. **[This
transformative effect, the capacity to rework the reality of social and
political existence, is, of course, the objective of waging war. War
forces change, strategy being both the science of its management and the
means to a putatively superior peace]{.underline}**. But Levinas' point,
and the basis of his ethical intervention, is that irrespective of their
being rendered such in strategic calculus and destroyed as such in
fighting, people are not only, or even primarily, brute facts, strategic
datum. Rather, they are, among other things, bearers of meaning and
manifestations of contemporary truths. They are the authors and outcomes
of social, political, and economic processes. [Reinvested with full
meaning, fighting marks the disruption of this wider order and the
people and other entities which populate it, the unmaking and remaking
of certainties, of meaning, of---potentially---the very coordinates of
social and political life]{.underline}. ''Since \[Napoleon\], all
campaigns have produced such comet like vibrations that they can
scarcely be thought of as only military because they involve the whole
of society'' (Clausewitz quoted in Bucholz 1985:25[). As the basic
element of the ontology of war then, fighting presents itself as a
duality. First, it drives the intellectual instrumentality of truth
about---and in---war, through its historicity and immediacy. But second,
it also exceeds the terms of that immediacy]{.underline}. **[This
''excess'' is the capacity of organized violence to be more than kinetic
exchange, to be constitutive and generative, to ''cast into motion''
subjects who are then alienated from themselves and come to know
themselves and the world in new ways]{.underline}**. For us, **[this
''excess,'' lying beyond the compelling, immanent socio-political logics
of combatants, is at the core of the ontology of war]{.underline}**. [It
is both that which gives war its status as an ontological event for
politics and society **and a problematizing framework from which a
critical approach to war studies might begin**. It is an ontology that
retains the power of war-centered analysis without limiting inquiry to a
focus on warfighting]{.underline}. We hold on to the ontological primacy
of fighting, but wrest it from the instrumentality its historicity
demands. In doing so, we note the material and intellectual importance
of this historicity. [War]{.underline}, like a societal centrifuge, [has
the power to draw in resources---intellectual, scientific, social,
economic, cultural, and political---and unmake and re-work them in ways
that cannot be foreseen. This disordering and reordering in part
determines the dynamics of strategic thought, the rise and fall of
various theories and paradigms of warfighting, as well as the more
general subjective violence, the violence to meaning,]{.underline} to
which Levinas testifies. We note also that **[this violence undoes many
traditional enframements of war: in its contingency and destruction, it
exceeds the strategic calculi of war as an instrument of policy; in its
generative power of re-making, it exceeds reduction to its destructive
consequences alone.]{.underline}** Having offered these observations on
the ontology of war, we now illustrate and expand upon them with
particular reference to the problem of knowledge in and about war.

### Alt -- Disarm from Below 

#### Alt -- We should engage in a "disarmament from below", an adaptive rhizomatic movement to envision and realize radical alternative security futures.

**Cooper 2006** (Neil, Director of the School of Peace and Conflict
Studies at Kent State University, "Putting Disarmament Back in the
Frame", Review of International Studies 32:2, pp 374-376)

The preceding analysis has attempted to demonstrate how, contrary to the
impres- sion given in the mainstream literature on arms limitation,
there has in fact been [a great deal of disarmament - at least in the
terms understood in the disarmament negotiations of the 1950s and 60s.
Yet these very successes have been coopted by arms controllers in ways
that function to delegitimise disarmament as Utopian and appear to
confirm realist representations of a world system with limited potential
for transformation. This article has also demonstrated the way in which
global civil society has been able to set an apparently more radical,
new arms limitation agenda for the new wars - one in particular which
has emphasised human and economic security rather than state and
military security]{.underline}. These factors then, represent a basis
for optimism about the future prospects for further disarmament.
However[, it is also the case that the contemporary disarmament and
broader arms limitation system is a highly asymmetric one geared to
preserving the military hegemony of the US and its allies.]{.underline}
Moreover, even the new arms limitation agenda is characterised by its
own asymmetries[. In particular, civil society has manifestly failed to
gain the same level of influence over core military security issues -
for example, NBC or the trade in major conventional weapons that keeps
Western defence industries viable. In some respects then, this analysis
shares certain commo- nalities with offensive realist critiques that
emphasise the problematic nature of arms control theory (albeit from a
different standpoint) and the supremacy of politics and power in
determining the possibilities for the control of arms]{.underline}.86
One response, therefore, might be to adopt a similar attitude of
resigned cynicism in the face of the overwhelming influence of power and
interest in shaping discourse and practice - and to conclude that a
truly emancipatory, as opposed to asymmetric, disarmament agenda is
unrealisable. [However, there are both material and ideational factors
immanent in the contemporary international system that suggest a
politics of radical emancipatory disarmament can be
constituted]{.underline}. First, the success of existing disarmament
initiatives - albeit under asymmetry - highlights [the real-world
relevance of disarma- ment proposals still dismissed as failed and
Utopian]{.underline}. This illustrates the potential for a [more radical
disarmament agenda to be realised by simultaneously deconstructing
hegemonic framings of the arms limitation problem and developing
alternative narratives that contain inherently transformatory meanings -
a powerful political act in itself]{.underline}. Second, [the
influential role of global civil society in new arms limitation suggests
the possibility of a truly progressive practice of arms limitation - a
kind of disarmament from below]{.underline}.87 In particular, campaigns
such as those on landmines or conflict diamonds demonstrate the ([as yet
unfulfilled) potential for networked and adaptive rhizomatic movements
to envision and realise radical alternative security
futures]{.underline}. This is not to deny the significant power
differentials that exist between states and civil society movements that
may themselves have different goals. However, [the flexibility of such
movements contrasts sharply with the rigid and sclerotic statist
institutions most immediately geared to dealing with the diplomacy of
arms limitation. Moreover, at their optimal, such swarming resistances
to hegemony have the potential to exploit the uncontrollable spaces and
flows of a networked information age88 to generate focused policy goals
and shared understandings; to generate political and cultural power by
exploiting global media tropes (Princess Diana as beatified saint
opposed to landmines) or creating their own (diamonds as blood
diamonds);89 to challenge both the threat discourses that underpin the
arms dynamic and the counsels of despair in the face of anarchy and a
supposed military technological imperative that lie at the heart of arms
control theory; and to thus effect change by eroding the legitimacy of
institutions and actors upholding militarism]{.underline}.90 Moreover,
such movements have the potential to resolve the perennial debate over
what has to come first before disarmament is realised - [radical
reduction of armaments or radical political change. The inevitable
corollary of the emergence of such rhizomatic social movements is that
the very act of campaigning for a radical disarmament agenda presages
radical change in the nature of local-global politics - the one brings
the other into being, and vice versa]{.underline}. Third, it might also
be argued that this is precisely the wrong time to articulate a new
disarmament agenda, particularly given the imperatives of the \'war on
terror\'. [However, to the extent that the threat of \'WMD\' terrorism
is rooted in material conditions, the safest response is to eliminate
the very weaponry that might be utilised - to move, if you like, from a
policy that aims to prevent loose nukes to a policy that aims simply to
lose nukes. Furthermore, rather than being an inopportune moment to
pursue a radical disarmament agenda, it is clear that we are now facing
a range of new and old arms limitation challenges that will require a
radically different kind of arms regulation. These include challenges
such as the growing pressure to weaponise space, the military potential
of the new biology, the weapon- isation of nanotechnology and the
challenge of controlling the military uses of cyberspace.]{.underline} A
further challenge is that presented by the growing importance of
dual-use technology for the military. This has been compounded by [the
simultaneous concentration and globalised integration of the defence
industry in a largely Western-dominated hub and spoke model
characterised by the erosion of defence industrial national identities
and increased intra-firm movement of technology and
knowledge]{.underline}.91 [Finally, there is the problem presented by
the extension and intensifi- cation of illicit global arms networks that
exploit porous borders, corrupt officials, lax regulation and the
mechanisms of globalisation to move arms to conflict
zones]{.underline}.92 The corollary of all this is that traditional,
supply-side non-proliferation initiatives based around the ability of
hermetic nation-states to supervise the physical move- ment of military
technology will inevitably be subject to declining utility. Such
developments then, are likely to require a qualitative step-shift in the
application of end-use monitoring and the kind of intrusive verification
of civil industries dealing with dual-use technologies presaged in the
CWC; the innovative adaptation of existing arms limitation methodologies
adopted by recipients and the peripheries - such as the extension of
nuclear weapons-free zones to incorporate bans on other military
technologies, or the greater use of moratoria/bans on arms imports; and
an enhanced role for local-global civil society as presaged by the role
of NGOs in monitoring implementation of the landmines treaty. In sum, if
the challenge of controlling contemporary military technology is to be
addressed effectively (and it may not be, of course), [then the new arms
limitation agenda of the current era is likely to represent merely a
half-way house towards a radically novel practice of arms limitation.
This will entail a move away from control primarily based on physical
management of objects (finished weapons, national militaries) and their
accumulation and movement within or across borders. Instead, current
trends will require a shift to a form of oversight and limitation
characterised by swarming]{.underline}.93 Such an approach will focus
far more on dual-use technologies and thus intrude into the very warp
and weft of socioeconomic life. It will be marked by a move from the
asymmetry of hegemon/supplier-dominated control and non- proliferation
instruments and imply a far greater role for recipients and the
peripheries. [It will require such a qualitative intensification and
expansion of the network of arms limitation practices that this in
itself will constitute a radically novel approach to arms limitation.
And it will require the interactive, interpenetrated agency of multiple
institutions and actors from states, multilateral institutions, NGOs,
industry, media, epistemic communities and society
generally]{.underline}.

### Alt -- New Ontologies 

#### The current ontologies of war have and will always fail, a new ontology must be created to escape this serial failure

**Burke 2007** (Anthony, Professor at the School of Humanities and
Social Sciences at UNSW Canberra ,\"Ontologies of War: Violence,
Existence and Reason.\" Theory & Event, vol. 10 no. 2, 2007)

I was motivated to begin the larger project from which this essay
derives by a number of concerns. I felt that [the available critical,
interpretive or performative languages of war]{.underline} \-- realist
and liberal international relations theories, just war theories, and
various Clausewitzian derivations of strategy \-- failed us, because
[they either perform or refuse to place under suspicion the underlying
political ontologies that I have sought to unmask and question here.
Many realists have quite nuanced and critical attitudes to the use of
force, but ultimately affirm strategic thought and remain embedded
within the existential framework of the nation-state. Both liberal
internationalist and just war doctrines seek mainly to improve the
accountability of decision-making in security affairs and to limit some
of the worst moral enormities of war, but]{.underline} (apart from the
more radical versions of cosmopolitanism) [they fail to question the
ontological claims of political community or strategic
theory.]{.underline}82 In the case of a theorist like Jean Bethke
Elshtain, just war doctrine is in fact allied to a softer, liberalised
form of the Hegelian-Schmittian ontology. She dismisses Kant\'s
Perpetual Peace as \'a fantasy of at-oneness\...a world in which
differences have all been rubbed off\' and in which \'politics, which is
the way human beings have devised for dealing with their differences,
gets eliminated.\'83 She remains a committed liberal democrat and
espouses a moral community that stretches beyond the nation-state, which
strongly contrasts with Schmitt\'s hostility to liberalism and his
claustrophobic distinction between friend and enemy. However her image
of politics \-- which at its limits, she implies, requires the resort to
war as the only existentially satisfying way of resolving deep-seated
conflicts \-- reflects much of Schmitt\'s idea of the political and
Hegel\'s ontology of a fundamentally alienated world of nation-states,
in which war is a performance of being. She categorically states that
any effort to dismantle security dilemmas \'also requires the
dismantling of human beings as we know them\'.84 [Whilst this would not
be true of all just war advocates, I suspect that even as they are so
concerned with the ought, moral theories of violence grant too much
unquestioned power to the is]{.underline}. The problem here lies with
the confidence in being \-- of \'human beings as we know them\' \--
[which ultimately fails to escape a Schmittian architecture and thus
eternally exacerbates (indeed reifies) antagonism]{.underline}s. Yet we
know from the work of Deleuze and especially William Connolly that
[exchanging an ontology of being for one of becoming, where the
boundaries and nature of the self contain new possibilities through
agonistic relation to others, provides a less destructive and violent
way of acknowledging and dealing with conflict and
difference]{.underline}.85 My argument here, whilst normatively
sympathetic to Kant\'s moral demand for the eventual abolition of war,
militates against excessive optimism.86 Even as I am arguing that war is
not an enduring historical or anthropological feature, or a neutral and
rational instrument of policy \-- that it is rather the product of
hegemonic forms of knowledge about political action and community \-- my
analysis does suggest some sobering conclusions about its power as an
idea and formation. Neither the progressive flow of history nor the
pacific tendencies of an international society of republican states will
save us. [The violent ontologies I have described here in fact dominate
the conceptual and policy frameworks of modern republican states and
have come]{.underline}, against everything Kant hoped for, [to stand in
for progress, modernity and reason.]{.underline} Indeed what Heidegger
argues, I think with some credibility, is that the enframing world view
has come to stand in for being itself. Enframing, argues Heidegger,
\'does not simply endanger man in his relationship to himself and to
everything that is\...it drives out every other possibility of
revealing\...the rule of Enframing threatens man with the possibility
that it could be denied to him to enter into a more original revealing
and hence to experience the call of a more primal truth.\'87 What I take
from Heidegger\'s argument \-- one that I have sought to extend by
analysing the militaristic power of modern ontologies of political
existence and security \-- is a view [that the challenge is posed not
merely by a few varieties of weapon, government, technology or policy,
but by an overarching system of thinking and understanding that lays
claim to our entire space of truth and existence. Many of the most
destructive features of contemporary modernity]{.underline} \--
militarism, repression, coercive diplomacy, covert intervention,
geopolitics, economic exploitation and ecological destruction [\--
derive not merely from particular choices by policymakers based on their
particular interests, but from calculative, \'empirical\' discourses of
scientific and political truth rooted in powerful enlightenment images
of being. Confined within such an epistemological and cultural universe,
policymakers\' choices become necessities, their actions become
inevitabilities, and humans suffer and die]{.underline}. Viewed in this
light, [\'rationality\' is the name we give the chain of reasoning which
builds one structure of truth on another until a course of action,
however violent or dangerous, becomes preordained through that
reasoning\'s very operation and existence]{.underline}. It creates both
discursive constraints \-- available choices may simply not be seen as
credible or legitimate \-- and material constraints that derive from the
mutually reinforcing cascade of discourses and events [which then
preordain militarism and violence as necessary policy responses, however
ineffective, dysfunctional or chaotic]{.underline}. The force of my own
and Heidegger\'s analysis does, admittedly, tend towards a deterministic
fatalism. On my part this is quite deliberate; it is important to allow
this possible conclusion to weigh on us. Large sections of modern
societies \-- especially parts of the media, political leaderships and
national security institutions \-- are utterly trapped within the
Clausewitzian paradigm, within the instrumental utilitarianism of
\'enframing\' and the stark ontology of the friend and enemy. They are
certainly tremendously aggressive and energetic in continually stating
and reinstating its force. But is there a way out? Is there no
possibility of agency and choice? Is this not the key normative problem
I raised at the outset, of how the modern ontologies of war efface
agency, causality and responsibility from decision making; the
responsibility that comes with having choices and making decisions, with
exercising power? (In this I am much closer to Connolly than Foucault,
in Connolly\'s insistence that, even in the face of the anonymous power
of discourse to produce and limit subjects, selves remain capable of
agency and thus incur responsibilities.88) There seems no point in
following Heidegger in seeking a more \'primal truth\' of being \-- that
is to reinstate ontology and obscure its worldly manifestations and
consequences from critique. However we can, while refusing Heidegger\'s
unworldly89 nostalgia, appreciate that he was searching for a way out of
the modern system of calculation; that he was searching for a
\'questioning\', \'free relationship\' to technology that would not be
immediately recaptured by the strategic, calculating vision of
enframing. Yet his path out is somewhat chimerical \-- his faith in
\'art\' and the older Greek attitudes of \'responsibility and
indebtedness\' offer us valuable clues to the kind of sensibility
needed, but little more. [When we consider the problem of policy, the
force of this analysis suggests that choice and agency can be all too
often limited; they can remain confined]{.underline} (sometimes quite
wilfully) [within the overarching strategic and security
paradigms.]{.underline} Or, more hopefully, [policy choices]{.underline}
could aim to bring into being a more enduringly inclusive, cosmopolitan
and peaceful logic of the political. But this [cannot be done without
seizing alternatives from outside the space of enframing and utilitarian
strategic thought, by being aware of its presence and weight and
activating a very different concept of existence, security and
action]{.underline}.90

### Alt -- Precarity 

#### The alternative is a precarious political mobilization beyond the dominant scripts of modernity- this act of disobedience is a prerequisite to effective resistance 

**Lorey and Butler 15**, Dr. Isabell Lorey is a Professor of Social
Science, Cultural and Gender Studies at the University of Basel, Judith
Butler is a Maxine Elliot Professor in the Department of Comparative
Literature and the Program of Critical Theory at the University of
California, Berkeley "State of Insecurity: Government of the
Precarious," *Verso Publications*, pp. vii-xi,

The important contribution of this thoughtful work is to let us
understand finally that [precarity is not a passing or episodic
condition, but a new form of regulation that distinguishes this
historical time]{.underline}. [When one claims that some populations are
more precarious than others, and tries to explain that
difference]{.underline}, [one is left with the task of explaining in
what precisely precarity consists]{.underline}, [where it begins and
ends, and how we understand its scope]{.underline} and its mechanisms.
In fact, we can only identify the instances by seeking recourse to its
more general form, and this leads us to a consideration of how
[precarity has itself become a regime]{.underline}, [a hegemonic mode of
being governed]{.underline}, [and governing ourselves]{.underline}.
Lorey\'s book allows us to consider the emergence of a neoliberal form
of regulation and power that is at once prefigured by Foucault and
exceeds his own theory of power. The text clearly relies on Foucault for
many important considerations, especially the understanding of power as
it produces a subject as well as its relationship with itself. But [it
also introduces a new question: how do we understand precarity and its
pervasive sense of \'insecurity\' as a dense site of power in subject
formation]{.underline}? In other words, [how do we understand the
organization of \'security\' under neoliberal conditions as requiring
and inducing precarity as a mode of life]{.underline}, [as an indefinite
trajectory, as the organizing principle for the process by which we are
governed and by which we come to govern ourselves?]{.underline} Lorey\'s
book works with enormous conceptual clarity to help us to distinguish
among forms of precarity, their social implications, and the particular
ways in which precarity names a new form of power and potential for
exploitation. Drawing on the history of political sovereignty, the
Marxist idea of reproductive labour, a feminist critique of ideas of
masculine independence, and an analysis of neoliberal forms of induced
destitution, Lorey\'s work offers a historically and politically nuanced
understanding of how new forms of power converge at the present time for
new regulatory purposes. Whatever one might want to say about the
transience or precarity of life itself, cast in existential terms, such
claims are not separable from the social and economic organization of
needs and, more particularly, the production of \'insecurity\' for the
purposes of extending securitarian forms of power.
[Lorey]{.underline}\'s work [asks us to pay close attention to
\'precarization\' as a process that produces not only
subjects]{.underline}, [but also \'insecurity\' as the central
preoccupation of the subject]{.underline}. [This particular form of
power lays the groundwork for establishing the need for security as the
ultimate political ideal]{.underline}, [one that works to amass power
within the state and corporate institutions at the same time that it
produces a new kind of subject]{.underline}. [In the place of critique
and resistance]{.underline}, [populations are now defined by their need
to be alleviated from insecurity]{.underline}, [valorizing forms of
police and state control]{.underline}, [promises of global investment,
and institutions of global governance]{.underline}. [Just as the
discourse of \'financial crisis\' can and does work to shore up the need
for greater managerial control of the market]{.underline} ([and the need
for an ever more expert set of capitalists]{.underline}), [so the
discourse of \'precarity\' consolidates power among those who wield the
power]{.underline} [to alternately promise its alleviation and threaten
its continuation]{.underline}. Lorey\'s work involves a rethinking of
the doctrine of sovereignty, offering an important reformulation of
Agamben\'s recent views on the sovereign exception. Situating her
analysis within a critique of liberal political philosophy and a revised
conception of biopolitics, Lorey shows how [sovereignty itself becomes
an instrument in the regulation and self-regulation of
populations]{.underline}. In fact, [everyone is prekarisiert by the
norms]{.underline} [that govern the idea of sovereign
citizens]{.underline}. Their [sovereignty depends on the presumption
that one\'s person or property is perpetually threatened by the
outside]{.underline}, [and that the exercise of sovereignty thus
consists in a demand for security]{.underline}. In a sense,
[contemporary securitarian regimes govern populations]{.underline} ([and
are thus bound up with biopolitics) by amplifying and redefining this
basic dynamic of \'defending against a threat\' that defines liberal
ideas of sovereign citizenship]{.underline}. [Ironically]{.underline},
if not painfully, [the idea of sovereignty implies
precarization]{.underline}, which at once gives the lie to the
traditional account of sovereign independence at the same time as it
exposes its inner logic. In the terms of later modernity, [the sovereign
people, and the sovereign subject, are threatened by forms of
illness]{.underline}, [contagions of sexual panic, waves of criminality,
possible invasions of many kinds]{.underline}. [Thus]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} [need for immunization becomes paramount]{.underline},
[and power takes the form of a subjugation by and through that
need]{.underline}. On the one hand, the sovereign subject is markedly
singular, and must be distinguished from the masses by its
individualization; and yet, the subject\'s relation to its own life is
clearly managed by large-scale forms of social and political regulation
that it has adopted and now cultivates as its own practice of
self-making. Indeed, [the more the subject regulates \[the\] him or her
self]{.underline}, [the more effectively does that broader form of
regulation work]{.underline} - [taking the form of a mode of
self-management that takes for granted the individuality]{.underline}
(and the need to cultivate the individual) [that is its very
instrument]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} important book [challenges
us to imagine political mobilizations that would refuse the lure of
\'being threatened\']{.underline} [and take a critical distance from
those forms of fearfulness that make us vulnerable to
exploitation]{.underline}. In effect, Lorey asks us to [think about the
alternatives to accepting fear and insecurity as the basis for a
political mobilization]{.underline}, [alternatives to accepting
deliberately induced states in which we seek security at all
costs]{.underline}. What would it mean to [focus instead on the induced
character of precarity]{.underline}, and the exploitation of insecurity?
[Power is imposed on the subject]{.underline}, [and yet power is the
means by which the subject relates to itself]{.underline}, [even
cultivates itself]{.underline}. Thus, [Lorey opposes a politics of pure
victimization]{.underline} [(that would see power as only imposed from
the outside]{.underline}) [as well as the ultimate value of
\'security\']{.underline} ([the affective investment of the regulated
subject]{.underline}). Instead, [she asks us to consider those forms of
political mobilization that rally precarity against those regimes that
seek to augment their power to manage and dispose of
populations]{.underline} - in other words, [precarity as activism. New
governmental forms engaged in the precarization of populations work
precisely through cultivating forms of subjectivation]{.underline} [and
practical possibilities]{.underline} (Handlungsmoglichkeiten) [that can,
and must be,]{.underline} [undone]{.underline} [through an activism of
the precarious]{.underline}, [one that combats the false promises of
security]{.underline}, [its managerial tactics, and its
exploitations]{.underline}.

### Alt -- Refusal 

#### Vote negative to refuse the 1AC -- Only through critique and refusal of the security apparatus can we recognize and rewrite the implications of the subjection and desires we encounter every day.

**Burke 2007** (Andrew, Professor of Politics and International
Relations at the University of New South Wales -- Australian political
theorist and international relations scholar, "War against the Other",
Routledge, p52-54)

[It is perhaps easy to become despondent, but as countless struggles for
freedom, justice and social transformation have proved, a sense of
seriousness can be tempered with the knowledge that many of the tools
are already available -- and where they are not, the effort to create a
productive new critical sensibility is well advanced]{.underline}. There
is also a crucial political opening within the liberal problematic
itself, in the sense that it assumes that [power is most effective when
it is absorbed as truth, consented to and desired -- which creates an
important space for dissent, critique and refusal.]{.underline} As Colin
Gordon argues, Foucault thought that [the very possibility of governing
was conditional on it being credible to the governed as well as the
governing]{.underline}.79 This throws weight onto the question of [how
security works as a technology of subjectivity]{.underline}. It is to
take up Foucault's challenge, [framed as a reversal of the liberal
progressive movement of being we have seen in Hegel, not to discover who
what are so much as to refuse what we are]{.underline}.80 [Just as
security rules subjectivity as both a totalising and individualising
blackmail and promise, it is at these levels we too can
intervene.]{.underline} We can critique the machinic frameworks of
possibility represented by law, policy, economic regulation and
diplomacy, while challenging the way these institutions deploy language
to draw individual subjects into their consensual web. This suggests, at
least provisionally, a dual strategy. The ﬁrst asserts the space for
agency, both in challenging available possibilities for being and their
larger socio-economic implications. [Pushing beyond security requires
tactics that can work at many levels: that empower individuals to
recognise the larger social, cultural and economic implications of the
everyday forms of desire, subjection and discipline they encounter, to
challenge and rewrite them, and which in turn contribute to collective
efforts to transform the larger structures of being, exchange and power
that sustain]{.underline} (and have been sustained by) [these
forms]{.underline}. As Derrida suggests, this is to open up aporetic
possibilities that transgress and call into question the boundaries of
the self, society and the international that security seeks to imagine
and police. The second seeks new ethical principles based on a critique
of the rigid and repressive forms of identity security has heretofore
offered. Thus writers such as Rosalyn Diprose, William Connolly and
Moira Gatens have sought to imagine a new ethical relationship, which
thinks difference not on the basis of the Same, but [on the basis of a
dialogue with the Other that might allow space for the unknown and
unfamiliar]{.underline}, for what Gatens calls a 'debate and engagement
with the other's law and the other's ethics' -- [an encounter which
involves a transformation of the self rather than the
other]{.underline}.81 (The potentials and limits of these models of
ethics are explored in more detail in Chapter 3, where I critically
analyse the political possibilities offered by the thought of Emmanuel
Levinas, Martin Heidegger and Martin Buber.) In short, [while the sweep
and power of security must be acknowledged, it must also be
refused]{.underline}: at the simultaneous levels of individual identity,
social order and macroeconomic possibility, it would entail another kind
of work on 'ourselves' -- [a political refusal of the One, the
imagination of an Other that never returns to the Same]{.underline}. [It
is to imagine a world in which alternative possibilities of society,
justice and existence are free to develop, independent of sovereign
ontologies and their animating forms of geopolitical control, desire and
violence. It is to ask if there can be a world or a security after
security, and what its shimmering possibilities might be.]{.underline}

### Alt -- Structural Criticism 

#### **Beginning with a widened structural criticism of militarism is a pre-requisite to effective critical ethico-political interventions -- voting aff crowds out critical readings of militarism** 

**Eastwood '18** (James, Professor in the School of Politics and IR at
the University of London. "Rethinking militarism as ideology: The
critique of violence after security," *Security Dialogue*, Vol. 49 (1-2)
-- Special issue on Militarism and security: Dialogue, possibilities and
limits. 44-- 56, doi: 10.1177/0967010617730949, p. 52-54)

[The range of critical security studies literatures calling for
desecuritization]{.underline} therefore [do not yet offer a full account
of militarism]{.underline} as I have elaborated it above, [in which
organized political violence is made desirable through ideology and
thereby loses strategic impetus and restraint. This is important because
it has also shaped the response of those seeking to reclaim security
against these critiques. Revealingly, these responses tend either to
reject the call for desecuritization as too pacifist or to develop
safeguards against the specific effects that these critics identify with
'militarization', rather than engaging with the underlying ideological
nature of militarism. While this has certainly left their analysis
wanting, and reveals an equally unsatisfactory conceptualization of
militarism, it also shows the limitations and vulnerability of critical
security studies arguments calling for desecuritization]{.underline}.
For example, Booth argues that security should only ever be the 'means'
for the 'end' of emancipation (Booth, 2007: 114--115) and that means and
ends should be related 'non-dualistically' (i.e. the means should be
consistent with the ends sought; see Booth, 2007: 428--441). He
explicitly includes political violence as a means that must be subject
to this rule (Booth, 2007: 429--431), and he even embraces aspects of
Gandhian nonviolence (Booth, 2007: 115). [Discussing the critique
offered by securitization theory, he responds, 'we would all presumably
agree that the unnecessary securitisation (militarisation) of issues is
to be deplored, but there are occasions when introducing a military
dimension is sensible']{.underline} (Booth, 2007: 168). [Booth's ethical
criteria for the use of force therefore give him the confidence to
respond that not all militarization is a bad thing, and that it can be
used for progressive ends]{.underline}. What is notable here is that
Booth also invokes a thin notion of 'militarization', more or less
reducible to the decision to use force, to establish his claim. He is
quite comfortable with the risks of militarization identified by
securitization theory because he believes he has circumvented them. By
contrast, the critique of militarism as ideology gives us more powerful
tools to disagree with Booth here. For Booth ignores the danger that, in
conditions of militarism, war can begin to serve a wide array of
non-strategic instrumentalities as a result of its ideological
penetration of social relations. Militarism can entrench a pattern of
conflict by binding social relations, subjectivities and identities to
the pursuit of war, thereby making war far less amenable to
ethico-political discipline than he imagines. By [setting up
emancipation as an imperative that must be 'secured', including
militarily, Booth opens a dangerous pathway to the entrenchment of
violence.]{.underline} Responding to critiques of securitization in
their cosmopolitan approach, [Burke, Lee-Koo and McDonald]{.underline}
are more sensitive to these dangers, admitting that the use of force can
entrench conflict and thus impair the longer term pursuit of global
security (Burke et al., 2014: 19--21). In response, they argue that the
ultimate aim of security practice should always be nonviolence, 'a
gradual but determined demilitarisation of global politics' in which
force is permissible under strict conditions but always regrettable --
'a pacifism of ends rather than means' (Burke et al., 2016: 74). They
[place their confidence in a set of detailed principles restricting the
use of force in different circumstances, which they hope will help to
avoid these risks]{.underline} (Burke et al., 2014: 71--97, 119--145).
[Again, however, the ambition for nonviolence rests on the thin basis of
an aspiration for 'demilitarization', something that they in fact derive
from the critique of securitization, rather than an understanding of
militarism as ideology]{.underline}. As I have explained above, [what
characterizes militarism is not violence with a lack of a true
justification but an ideological desire for war and military activity.
Militarism is therefore fully compatible with a credible justification
for violence, and may even draw strength from it]{.underline}. Burke,
Lee-Koo and McDonald's criteria for the use of force may well be
stricter than available alternatives, therefore, but this is still no
guarantee against militarism. Even if they succeeded in preventing some
wars, they would still not ensure that the remaining, apparently
justified wars did not indulge in and encourage militarism.
[Cosmopolitan theories therefore do not disrupt the ideological factors
making war desirable; rather, they risk supplementing them with
additional justifications. A more effective critical intervention
against cosmopolitan security is therefore to highlight the dangers of
militarism as ideology, rather than simply to call for
demilitarization]{.underline}. Conclusion [What the above arguments
stress is the importance of embracing a critical concept of militarism,
one premised on the explicit ambition to disrupt its ideological
effects]{.underline}. With this in mind, it is worth considering why
most critical security studies scholars prefer to adopt the term
'militarization' rather than 'militarism'. 'Militarization' in this
usage seems to imply the process of making something a military concern.
In this way, it is similar to Shaw's account, in which militarization
implies an increase in the penetration of social relations in general by
military relations -- or, in other words, the process by which more and
more things are made military concerns. [For Shaw, the concept of
militarism functions as a measure of this penetration. But this is not
the same as a critical concept of militarism, in which the specific kind
of penetration being analysed is an ideological penetration and in which
the intention is to disrupt this penetration through
critique]{.underline}. [Like Shaw, critical security studies has also
understood militarism as a measure (of 'militarization') rather than as
a critical concept, with the result that its analytic and political
potential has been blunted when engaging in the critique of
violence.]{.underline} However, this may also be a reflection of an
underlying tendency in critical security studies itself. For we could
argue that [neither security nor securitization are critical concepts in
the sense intended by ideology critique. Instead, they are more like
measures, in that they measure either how secure something is or how
securitized an issue has become. One consequence of this, which is
particularly problematic for scholars seeking desecuritization, is that
these concepts therefore also actively participate in the process they
seek to critique: they name things as 'security' issues, even when the
argument is that these issues should not be security issues at all. This
proliferation of security concerns, encouraged as much by scholarship as
by practitioners, results in the 'crowding out' of other frameworks that
may more accurately reflect the underlying dynamics -- concepts such as
war]{.underline} (Barkawi, 2011) [or neoliberalism]{.underline}
(Montesinos Coleman and Rosenow, 2016) -- [and that may be more
appropriate for critical ethico-political interventions into phenomena
that critical security studies interprets as security or securitization.
My final suggestion is that militarism is yet another concept that risks
being obscured in critical security studies analysis by this tendency to
measure rather than critique. By contrast, I have shown above how a more
critical concept of militarism as ideology can offer a superior starting
point for an analysis of the shortcomings of various justifications for
the use of force, including those encountered in critical security
studies. Militarism can help us to think more precisely about the
circumstances in which the use of violence to achieve political
objectives (such as 'security') can descend into a more generalized and
intractable desire for war and military activity. My hope is that from
such an understanding we might also better equip ourselves to intervene
in this process and resist it.]{.underline}

## Blocks 

### 2NC Framework 

#### **The lenses with which we view war and peace influence the policy options we consider -- academia is a critical space to address these issues**

**Cady '10** (Duane L., prof of phil @ hamline university, From Warism
to Pacifism: A Moral Continuum, pp. 115-117)

The very notion of restraint in war--- common to all positions along ¶
the full continuum in varying degrees--- puts the burden of proof on
going to war and on how the fighting is done. [These are]{.underline}
the [activities in]{.underline} ¶ [need of justification. The moral
presumption should be to]{.underline} peace, [positive peace, rather
than the pervasive presumption of]{.underline} warism and [negative
peace. Recognizing the grip that warism has on dominant
culture]{.underline} ¶ [may be the most formidable task of genuine
peacemaking]{.underline} for the fore-¶ seeable future
[because]{.underline} it is [warism]{.underline} that [blocks evolution
toward more]{.underline} ¶ [pacifistic societies]{.underline}. Only
occasionally will individuals back into the ¶ most absolute form of
pacifism; the cultural predisposition to warism ¶ confines most of us to
a narrow range of options toward the war- realist ¶ end of the scale.
This brings us full circle and we end this consideration of a moral
continuum on the morality of war and peace where we ¶ began, confronting
warism.¶ [The **normative lenses** of warism, the **spectacles through
which we**]{.underline} ¶ in modern culture tend to [**see and interpret
all that happens**, turn out]{.underline} ¶ [to be as much like
**blinders** as lenses because they **restrict our vision**
to]{.underline} ¶ [a narrow range of options. Nietzsche said that **if
the only tool you have**]{.underline} ¶ [**is a hammer, everything
begins to look like a nail.** Under such conditions it is pretty hard to
resist hammering.]{.underline} Analogously, **[if the
only]{.underline}** ¶ **[vision we have is warist and the only tools we
build are weapons, then]{.underline}** ¶ every conflict invites military
intervention and **[it is hard to resist war]{.underline}**-¶ ring.
[Unless we envision a wider]{.underline} value [perspective than the
warist, we]{.underline} ¶ [will not see]{.underline} the [nonviolent
options]{.underline} before us. But to see more widely ¶ [we need to
**acknowledge and remove the blinders**]{.underline}.¶ [Peace education
is]{.underline} a [small]{.underline}, struggling, [but
growing]{.underline} segment of ¶ contemporary education. [The dominant
presumption of warism has]{.underline} ¶ [made it difficult
for]{.underline} those committed to [peace education]{.underline} [to
develop]{.underline} ¶ and establish it [as a legitimate
discipline]{.underline} devoid of the image of mere ¶ anti- militarist
propaganda. Some scholars call themselves peace educators while many
within the traditional disciplines are reluctant to be ¶ so labeled;
they may be sympathetic with genuine peace research and ¶ teaching but
afraid of the stigma that goes with the label. Those [scholars
interested in applying their professional]{.underline} training and
[skills to peace]{.underline} ¶ issues [face a monumental task.
Education **at all levels must address**]{.underline} ¶ [**warism**,
just as they have had to address racism, sexism, ageism, classism,
homophobia, and other forms of domination.]{.underline}4 There is
increasing ¶ academic interest in what scholars call "institutional
violence"--- social ¶ structures like racism, sexism, and poverty that
involve constraints ¶ that injure and violate; systems that have
entrapping, coercive effects. Institutional forms of violence tend to be
more covert than overt; ¶ nonetheless pacifists--- peacemakers---of
various sorts tend to work ¶ toward the recognition and abolition of
these forms of oppression as ¶ the natural manifestation of their
commitment to positive peace. Such ¶ work involves recovery of lost or
neglected history, consideration of a ¶ full range of options beyond
traditional social constraints holding the ¶ forms of domination in
place, and serious, systematic, and legitimized ¶ study of conditions
constituting positive peace. Preparing for [war in]{.underline} ¶ [an
effort to prevent war and preserve the status quo must be distinguished
from]{.underline} preparing for [genuine positive peace]{.underline} in
an effort to en-¶ courage cooperation and preclude a resort to war.

### 2NC Framework 

#### Our framework arguments are an independent impact -- the affirmative's production of knowledge that benefits the military ensures further violence

**Chow '06** (Rey, Humanities and Modern Culture & Media Studies at
Brown, The Age of the World Target: Self-Referentiality in War, Theory,
and Comparative Work, 40-1)

A largely administrative enterprise, closely tied to policy, the new
American Orientalism took over from the old Orientalism attitudes of
cultural hostility, among which is, as Said writes, the dogma that "the
Orient is at bottom something either to be feared (the Yellow Peril, the
Mongol hordes, the brown dominos) or to be controlled (by pacification,
research and development, outright occupation possible.)¶ [Often under
the]{.underline} modest [**apparently innocuous agendas** of fact
gathering and documentation, **the "scientific" and "objective"
production of knowledge during peacetime**]{.underline} about the
various special "areas" became the institutional practice that
[substantiated]{.underline} and elaborated the **[militaristic
conception of the world as target.]{.underline}** In other words,
[despite the claims about the apolitical]{.underline} and disinterested
[nature of]{.underline} the pursuit of [higher learning, activities
undertaken under the rubric of]{.underline} area studies, such as
language training. Historiography, anthropology, [economics, political
science, and so forth, are **fully inscribed in the politics and
ideology of war.**]{.underline} To that extent, [the disciplining,
research, and]{.underline} development of [so-called academic
information are part and parcel of a strategic logic.]{.underline} And
yet, if [the production of knowledge (with its]{.underline} vocabulary
of [aims and goals, research, data analysis, experimentation, and
verification)]{.underline} in fact [shares the same scientific and
military premises as war]{.underline}---if, for instance, the ability to
translate a difficult language can be regarded as equivalent to the
ability to break military codes---is it a surprise that it is doomed to
fail in its avowed attempts to "know" the other cultures? [Can
"knowledge" that is derived from the same]{.underline} kinds of [bases
as war put an end to the violence of warfare, or is such knowledge not
simply **warfare's accomplice**, destined to destroy rather than
preserve]{.underline} the forms of [lives]{.underline} at which it aims
to focus[?]{.underline}¶ [As long as knowledge is produced in
this]{.underline} self-referential [manner]{.underline}, as a circuit of
targeting or getting the other that ultimately consolidates the
omnipotence and omnipresence of the sovereign "self"/"eye"---the
"I"---that is the United States, [the other will have no choice but
remain]{.underline} just that---[a target whose existence
justifies]{.underline} only one thing, **[its destruction]{.underline}**
by the bomber. As long as the focus of our study of Asia remains by the
United States, and as long as this focus is not accompanied by knowledge
of what is happening elsewhere at other times as well as the present,
[such study will ultimately confirm]{.underline} once again [the
self-referential function of]{.underline} virtual worlding that was
unleashed by the dropping of the atomic bombs, with the United States
always occupying the position of the bomber, and [other cultures always
viewed as the **military and information target fields.**]{.underline}
In this manner, events whose historicity does not fall into the
epistemically closed orbit of the atomic bomber---such as the Chinese
reactions to the war from a primarily anti-Japanese point of view that I
alluded to at the beginning of this chapter---will never receive the
attention that is due to them. ["Knowledge," however conscientiously
gathered]{.underline} and however large in volume, [will lead only to
further]{.underline} silence and to the **[silencing of diverse
experiences.]{.underline}** This is one reason why, as Harootunian
remark, area studies have been, since its inception, haunted by the
"absence of definable object"---and by "the problem of the vanishing
object."

### [2NC Alt Framing]{.underline} 

#### An informed analysis of the role of militarism in global arms and its relation to the state is vital to creating a praxis from which we can develop future arms sale policies. Any other approach limits the ability of human security agendas to restrict the circulation of arms. 

**Stavrianakis '19** (Anna Stavrianakis, Lecturer in International
Relations at the University of Sussex, 07/25/2018, "Controlling Weapons
Circulation in a Postcolonial Militarised World," Review of
International Studies (2019), 45: 1, 57-76)

In the desire to promote the spread of human security practices, there
has been little attention to why an initiative such as the ATT might be
resisted, beyond narrowly strategic or instrumental concerns or a
failure to internalise human security norms. [Thinking about modes of
militarism, and the ways in which the human security agenda has
transformed, but not necessarily diminished, militarism can help us
think more creatively, both analytically and politically, about what is
at stake. We need to understand and explain patterns of militarism
because of the paradoxical role of military power and systematic or
organised violence in international relations.]{.underline} On the one
hand, military power has historically been fundamental to the
constitution of organised political power, be it in the form of the
state or otherwise. On the other hand, demilitarisation from current
levels and forms is a condition for improved human security. A
contraction of the influence of the "social relations, institutions and
values" of war and war preparation on social relations, institutions and
values more generally reduces the likelihood of violent responses to
political problems, reduces the secrecy and corruption associated with
military decisions or military involvement in the economy, and lowers
the opportunity costs associated with high levels of military spending,
to name a few reasons. [But militarism has been pushed off the agenda,
precisely because it strikes at the core issues around war preparation
and the constitution of political community and political economy, and
because the maintenance of coercive capacities in the South is central
to aid donors' and Southern elites' interests, not to mention the
entrenched coercive orientation of Northern states' foreign
policies.]{.underline}

[For these reasons a human security agenda is limited in terms of its
ability to generate more restrictive weapons transfer
practices]{.underline}.

### AT: Pragmatism

#### The characterization of our alternative as Utopian is used by realists to maintain their intellectual hegemony and perpetuate their effects on arms policy, the alternative is necessary and isn't mindlessly Utopian

**Cooper 2006** (Neil, Director of the School of Peace and Conflict
Studies at Kent State University, "Putting Disarmament Back in the
Frame", Review of International Studies 32:2, p)

This categorisation of disarmament highlights part of the problem with
the way in which arms control theory frames both arms control and
disarmament. First[, in framing disarmament as failed and Utopian it
downplays the progress made in realising the disarmament agenda of the
1950s and 60s that structural disarmament combined with a series of
partial disarmament treaties has brought, and thus the extent to which
even Utopia might be realistic for future generations]{.underline}.
Second[, in enveloping a succession of really existing disarmament
initiatives within the essentially realist/neorealist framework of the
arms control perspective it undermines the claim of disarmament as a
practice and set of goals with real-world relevance]{.underline}. In
combination [this amounts to a very powerful discursive strategy that
works to maintain the intellectual hegemony of arms control theory in
particular and realist academia and policymaking more
generally]{.underline}. To invert Ken Booth, what is at work here is
what might be termed realist utopianism33 - the capture and suborning of
Utopian achievements in ways that work to shore up the realist view of a
world long on dangers and short on peaceful strategies to confront them.
[In contrast, when the various types of disarmament (some of which have
a decidedly non-utopian flavour to them) are reclaimed under the
disarmament rubric, then it becomes clear that the world has, and is,
experiencing a tremendous amount of disarmament - some of it relatively
successful]{.underline}. This also has profound implications for the
supposed distinction between arms control and disarmament around which
arms control theory is based[. Once we move from framing (successful)
partial disarmament as merely one variant of arms control, and instead
frame both GCD and partial disarmament as variants of disarmament
practice; once we understand disarmament as an activity that is
advocated by both Utopians and hyper-realists alike (albeit in different
ways) then both the empirical and philosophical distinctions between
arms control and disarmament fall away. As will be noted below, this
implies that we need to develop an alternative way of conceptualising
the different strategies of arms limitation and the structure of the
contemporary arms limitation system.]{.underline}

### AT: Arc of History 

#### The 1AC's securitized narrative of history is based on fictionalized reality and leads to threats and securitized violence

**Melley 2012** (Timothy, Professor of English and Affiliate of American
Studies at Miami University, "The Covert Sphere: Secrecy, Fiction, and
the National Security State," Cornell University Press, 143-147)
\*edited for clarity\*

The defense of imaginative writing against the claims of history and
other "serious" discourses dates back at least to Philip Sidney's late
sixteenth- century Defence of Poesy. But when did the defense of poetry
begin to in- voke the deceptions of the state? When, that is, did
novelists begin to trumpet the value of fiction over history and
nonfictional discourse as a corrective to state secrecy? The answer
seems to be during the 1960s.1 Consider, for instance, Norman Mailer's
groundbreaking narrative of the 1967 anti-Vietnam march on the Pentagon,
Armies of the Night. Trying to narrate the event first as fiction and
then as history, Mailer eventually decides that "the mystery of the
events at the Pentagon cannot be developed by the methods of history---
only by the instincts of the novelist."2 To some extent, this assertion
rests on the familiar notion that the novel can render the "interior
experience" (i.e., the individual human experience) of events in a way
traditional historical narrative cannot. But [Mailer]{.underline} also
[finds traditional history blocked by new features of the Cold War
public sphere: "Journalistic information available from both sides is so
incoherent, inaccurate, contradictory, malicious, even based on error
that no accurate history is conceivable"]{.underline} ( Armies of the
Night, 284). This critique echoes Habermas's account of the mass
cultural trans- formation of the public sphere. But it also links the
transformation of the public sphere to Cold War state deception. [The
march on the Pentagon]{.underline}, Mailer asserts, [was a protest
against "the authority, because the authority lied]{.underline}. It lied
[through the teeth of corporation executives and Cabinet officials and
police enforcement officers and newspaper editors and advertising
agencies]{.underline}, and in its mass magazines" (104). The "authority"
and the "corporation" are Mailer's shorthand for a vast apparatus of
media structures, corporate interests, and state institutions whose
headquarters is the Pentagon but which also includes the CIA, the FBI,
and even "the Warren Commission" (104). [The chief effect of this
apparatus is a national "state of suppressed
schizophrenia"]{.underline}---a [contradiction between religious fervor
and technological rationality---]{.underline}which [makes "the average
good Christian American secretly \[love\] the war in
Vietnam]{.underline}" (212). In a dysfunctional public sphere, Mailer
suggests, "[misinformation in systematic form tends to create mass
schizophrenia]{.underline}" (161). Mailer's account of this problem is
among the most influential historiographic experiments of the postwar
era. As Linda Hutcheon points out, it illustrates that the "basic
postmodernist stance---of a questioning of authority---obviously is a
result of the ethos of the 1960s."3 The wave of postmodern
historiographic metafiction that followed [The Armies of the Night has
similarly asserted the value of fiction over history]{.underline}---[not
only the sense that fiction offers something history cannot but also the
sense that history is at some level indistinguishable from
fiction]{.underline}.4 This shift itself is not primarily a result the
Cold War. It is part of a larger, twentieth-century attack on the
empiricist historiography of the nineteenth century, [a critique that
has troubled the notion of "facts," stressed the creative power of the
historian]{.underline}, and emphasized the literary qualities of
historical narrative.5 As history has come to seem more like [fiction
and canonical history \[have\] been critiqued as an ideological
vehicle]{.underline}, many [novelists have argued that the truth-value
of fiction sometimes trumps that of narrative history]{.underline}. It
is nonetheless striking how [many U.S. authors understand the postmodern
historiographic crisis as a specific consequence of the National
Security State]{.underline}. For the novelist Charles Baxter, [state
deception transformed the nature of U.S. narrative, making it
"dysfunctional]{.underline}." "The greatest influence on American
fiction for the last twenty years," Baxter writes, is Richard Nixon,
"the inventor, for our purposes and for our time, of the concept of
deniability": What difference does it make to writers of stories if
[public figures]{.underline} are denying their responsibility for their
own actions?\...Well, to make an obvious point, they [create a climate
in which social narratives are designed to be deliberately incoherent
and misleading]{.underline}. [Such narratives humiliate]{.underline} the
act of [storytelling]{.underline} \[for\] only a coherent narrative can
manage to explain public events. . . . [Every story is a
history]{.underline} . . . [and when there is no comprehensible story,
there is, in some sense, no history]{.underline}; [the
past]{.underline}, under those circumstances, [becomes an unreadable
mess]{.underline}.6 Baxter here finds the narratives of an entire
society transformed by the official duplicity of the Cold War state. The
covert operations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, for
instance---particularly their "efforts to acquire deniability on the
arms-for-hostages deal with Iran"---produced "public befuddlement about
facts, forgetfulness under oath, and constant disavowals of political
error and criminality" ("Dysfunctional Narratives," 396). While Baxter
lays this problem at Nixon's feet, it is in fact an institutional
feature of the Cold War. Richard Nixon may still be the most enduring
public face of deniability, but he was certainly not its "inventor," as
Baxter claims. If deniability can be said to have an author, then it was
George Kennan, whose 1948 National Security Council memorandum NSC-10/2
gave the CIA its charter to covert actions so long as "the U.S.
government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them."7 This
concept anchored other major secret policy documents long before Richard
Nixon ever took office. In National Security Action Memorandum 273, for
instance, the Kennedy administration laid out its plan for a secret war
in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia that could be conducted only if the
president were assured "plausibility of denial."8 The real problem,
then, is an institutionally supported "culture of disavowal" that Baxter
believes has trickled down from presidents to every corner of U.S.
culture, from the lurid blame game of the afternoon talk- show circuit
to prizewinning novels by Jane Smiley and Don DeLillo. The major quality
of "narrative dysfunction," as Baxter describes it, is a lack of causal
explanation. In a dysfunctional narrative, the narrator uses the passive
voice and "gathers around herself a cloak of unreliability"
("[Dysfunctional Narratives]{.underline}," 398). Such narratives [fail
to identify]{.underline} "the agent of the action" or "[why it was
done]{.underline}" (397). "One of the signs of a dysfunctional narrative
is that we cannot leave it behind, and we cannot put it to rest, because
it does not, finally, give us the explanation we need to enclose it"
(397). In all of these ways, Baxter describes features scholars commonly
associate with postmodern narrative. According to Marie-Laure Ryan,
[postmodern "antinarrative" sometimes resembles a sketch]{.underline}
under constant revision, "[where represented events never]{.underline}
gel into 'facts' and never [fit into]{.underline}\...[a stable and
comprehensible narrative]{.underline}." Brian McHale describes a similar
strategy called "weak narrativity," which involves "telling stories
'poorly,' distractedly, with much irrelevance and indeterminacy, in such
a way as to evoke narrative coherence while at the same time withholding
commitment to it and undermining confidence in it."9 Significantly,
however, while Ryan and McHale describe the deliberate construction of a
"poor," weak, or (to return to Baxter's term) "dysfunctional" narrative,
Baxter views narrative dysfunction as a symptom, and not a critique, of
official obfuscation. For instance, while [he calls the Kennedy
assassination "the narratively dysfunctional event of our
era]{.underline}" ([because "no one]{.underline} really [knows who's
responsible]{.underline} for it"), he also singles out De- Lillo's Libra
as one of his major examples of dysfunctional narrative ("Dysfunctional
Narratives," 397). This seems misguided to me. What Libra so brilliantly
reveals about the Kennedy case is the dysfunction of the public sphere
itself.

### AT: Authors Get Fired 

#### There's no marketplace of ideas in security studies -- repetition makes discourses of danger lucrative

**Oren and Solomon 15** (Ido Oren, associate professor and chair of the
Department of Political Science at the University of Florida, PhD in
political science from the University of Chicago, Ty Solomon, lecturer

international relations from the University of Florida, April 2015,
"WMD, WMD, WMD: Securitization through ritualized incantation of
ambiguous phrases," *Review of International Studies* Volume 41 Issue 2)

[Prominent American scholars have conceptualised national security
policymaking in terms of a 'marketplace of ideas']{.underline}.25 In
this conceptual framework, government officials communicate fact-based
(if often exaggerated) arguments that depict external threats and
propose measures to tackle these threats. [The media and academy serve
as watchdogs that debate the accuracy of the facts and help 'weed out
unfounded, mendacious, or self-serving foreign policy
arguments']{.underline}.26 In the wake of the debate the public decides
whether to 'buy' the argument.

[The 'marketplace of ideas' framework evokes a bygone era -- if there
ever was such an era -- in which sellers communicated largely
descriptive information about their products to potential buyers with
pre-existing tastes. In contemporary mass society, however, the
'marketplace' is characterised]{.underline} less by selling goods than
by the aggressive marketing of 'brands', [less by providing fact-based
arguments about a product than by fostering consumer identification with
values]{.underline} symbolised by a brand.27 Arguably [the principal
characteristic of modern mass marketing campaigns -- a characteristic
'so obvious' that its significance is 'sometimes neglected' -- is
repetition]{.underline}.28 Advertisers continually bombard us with
symbols such as brand logos (the Nike swoosh), icons (Marlboro Man; Mr.
Clean), and taglines ('Just do it'; 'We try harder'; 'Intel Inside').
[These images and words are repeated over and over again
because]{.underline}, as political and corporate consultant Frank Luntz
put it, 'companies learned an important rule of successful brands:
[Message consistency builds customer loyalty]{.underline} ... Finding a
good message and sticking with it takes extraordinary discipline but it
pays off tenfold in the end.'29

### AT: Chandler 

#### Chandler's argument is that global war is no longer about direct control, rather a decentralized system of violence. That's our argument

**Chandler '09** (David Chandler, department of Politics and
International Relations, University of Westminster, "War Without End(s):
Grounding the Discourse of 'Global War'" UK SAGE Publications, 2009, KB)

The policy frameworks of global war attempt to make sense of the
implosion of the framework of international order at the same time as
articulating the desire to recreate a framework of meaning through
policy activity. However, these projections of Western power, even when
expressed in co­ercive and militarized forms, appear to have little
connection to strategic or instrumental projects of hegemony. [The
concept of 'control', articulated by]{.underline} authors such as Carl
[Schmitt and]{.underline} Faisal [Devji]{.underline}, [seems to be key
to understanding the transition from strategic frameworks of conflict to
today's unlimited]{.underline} (i.e. arbitrary) [expressions of
violence.]{.underline} [Wars fought for control]{.underline}, with a
socially grounded telluric character, [are limited by the needs of
instrumental rationality: the goals shape the means
deployed.]{.underline} [Today's Western wars are fought in a
nonstrategic, non-instrumental framework, which lacks a clear
relationship between means and ends and can]{.underline} therefore
[easily acquire a destabilizing and irrational character.]{.underline}
[To mistake the arbitrary and unlimited nature of violence and coercion
without a clear strategic framework for a heightened desire for control
fails to contextualize conflict in the social relations of
today.]{.underline}

### AT: Chandler 

#### Chandler's argument merely plays into existing ontologies of domination by maintaining that what we need is simply more knowledge, more tactics, more strategy, all the while ignoring that this form of hubristic aim at mastery reifies metaphysical domination 

**Burke '07** (Anthony Burke, associate professor of international and
political studies at the University of New South Wales, PhD in political
science and international relations from the Australian National
University, 2007, "Ontologies of War: Violence, Existence and Reason,"
*Theory and Event* Volume 10 Issue 2, modified)

By itself, [such an account of the nationalist ontology of war and
security provides only a general insight into the perseverance of
military violence as a core element of politics]{.underline}. It does
not explain why so many [policymakers think military violence
works]{.underline}. As I argued earlier, [such an ontology is married to
a more rationalistic form of strategic thought that claims to link
violent means to political ends predictably and controllably, and which,
by doing so, combines military action and national purposes into a
common \-- and thoroughly modern \-- horizon of certainty]{.underline}.
Given Hegel\'s desire to decisively distil and control the dynamic
potentials of modernity in thought, it is helpful to focus on the
modernity of [this ontology]{.underline} \-- one that [is modern in its
adherence to modern scientific models of truth, reality and
technological progress, and in its insistence on imposing images of
scientific truth from the physical sciences]{.underline} (such as
mathematics and physics) [onto human behaviour, politics and
society]{.underline}. For example, the military theorist and historian
Martin van Creveld has argued that one of the reasons Clausewitz was so
influential was that his \'ideas seemed to have chimed in with the
rationalistic, scientific, and technological outlook associated with the
industrial revolution\'.54 [Set into this epistemological matrix, modern
politics and government engages in a sweeping project of mastery and
control in which all of the world\'s resources \-- mineral, animal,
physical, human \-- are made part of a machinic process of which war and
violence are viewed as normal features]{.underline}. These are the
deeper claims and implications of Clausewitzian strategic reason. One of
the most revealing contemporary examples comes from the writings (and
actions) of Henry Kissinger, a Harvard professor and later U.S. National
Security Adviser and Secretary of State. He wrote during the Vietnam war
that after 1945 [U.S. foreign policy was based \'on the assumption that
technology plus managerial skills gave us the ability to reshape the
international system and to bring about domestic transformations in
emerging countries\']{.underline}. This \'scientific revolution\' had
\'for all practical purposes, removed technical limits from the exercise
of power in foreign policy\'.55 [Kissinger\'s conviction was based not
merely in his pride]{.underline} in the vast military and bureaucratic
apparatus of the United States, [but in a particular epistemology
(theory of knowledge).]{.underline} Kissinger asserted that the West is
\'deeply committed to the notion that the real world is external to the
observer, that knowledge consists of recording and classifying data \--
the more accurately the better\'. [This, he claimed, has since the
Renaissance set the West apart from an \'undeveloped\' world that
contains \'cultures that have escaped the early impact of Newtonian
thinking\' and remain wedded to the \'essentially pre-Newtonian view
that the real world is almost entirely internal to the
observer\']{.underline}.56 At the same time, [Kissinger\'s hubris and
hunger for control was beset by a corrosive anxiety: that, in an era of
nuclear weapons proliferation and constant military modernisation, of
geopolitical stalemate in Vietnam, and the emergence and militancy of
new post-colonial states, order and mastery were harder to define and
impose. He worried over the way \'military bipolarity\' between the
superpowers had \'encouraged political multipolarity\', which \'does not
guarantee stability]{.underline}. Rigidity is diminished, but so is
manageability\...equilibrium is difficult to achieve among states widely
divergent in values, goals, expectations and previous experience\'
(emphasis added). [He mourned that \'the greatest need of the
contemporary international system is an agreed concept of
order\']{.underline}.57 Here were [the driving obsessions of the modern
rational statesman based around a hunger for stasis and certainty that
would entrench U.S. hegemony:]{.underline} For the two decades after
1945, our international activities were based on the assumption that
technology plus managerial skills gave us the ability to reshape the
international system and to bring about domestic transformations in
\"emerging countries\". This direct \"operational\" concept of
international order has proved too simple. Political multipolarity makes
it impossible to impose an American design. Our deepest challenge will
be to evoke the creativity of a pluralistic world, to base order on
political multipolarity even though overwhelming military strength will
remain with the two superpowers.58 [Kissinger\'s statement revealed that
such cravings for order and certainty continually confront chaos,
resistance and uncertainty: clay that won\'t be worked, flesh that will
not yield, enemies that refuse to surrender]{.underline}. This is one of
the most powerful lessons of the Indochina wars, which were to continue
in a phenomenally destructive fashion for six years after Kissinger
wrote these words. Yet [as his sinister, Orwellian exhortation to
\'evoke the creativity of a pluralistic world\' demonstrated,
Kissinger\'s hubris was undiminished]{.underline}. This is a vicious,
historic irony: [a desire to control nature, technology, society and
human beings that is continually frustrated, but never abandoned or
rethought]{.underline}. By 1968 U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara, the rationalist policymaker par excellence, had already
decided that U.S. power and technology could not prevail in Vietnam;
Nixon and Kissinger\'s refusal to accept this conclusion, to abandon
their Cartesian illusions, was to condemn hundreds of thousands more to
die in Indochina and the people of Cambodia to two more decades of
horror and misery.59 In 2003 there would be a powerful sense of déja vu
as another Republican Administration crowned more than decade of failed
and destructive policy on Iraq with a deeply controversial and divisive
war to remove Saddam Hussein from power. In this struggle with the
lessons of Vietnam, revolutionary resistance, and rapid geopolitical
transformation, [we are witness to an enduring political and cultural
theme: of a craving for order, control and certainty in the face of
continual uncertainty]{.underline}. Closely related to this anxiety was
the way that [Kissinger\'s thinking]{.underline} \-- and that of
McNamara and earlier imperialists like the British Governor of Egypt
Cromer \-- [was embedded in instrumental images of technology and the
machine: the machine as both a tool of power and an image of social and
political order]{.underline}. In his essay \'The Government of Subject
Races\' Cromer envisaged effective imperial rule \-- over numerous
societies and billions of human beings \-- as best achieved by a central
authority working \'to ensure the harmonious working of the different
parts of the machine\'.60 [Kissinger analogously invoked the virtues of
\'equilibrium\', \'manageability\' and \'stability\' yet]{.underline},
writing some six decades later, [was anxious that technological progress
no longer brought untroubled control: the Westernising \'spread of
technology and its associated rationality\...does not inevitably produce
a similar concept of reality\']{.underline}.61 We sense the [rational
policymaker\'s frustrated desire: the world is supposed to work like a
machine, ordered by a form of power and governmental reason which
deploys machines and whose desires and processes are meant to run along
ordered, rational lines like a machine]{.underline}. Kissinger\'s desire
was little different from that of [Cromer]{.underline} who, wrote Edward
Said: \...[envisions a seat of power in the West and radiating out from
it towards the East a great embracing machine, sustaining the central
authority yet commanded by it. What the machine\'s branches feed into it
from the East \-- human material, material wealth, knowledge, what have
you \-- is processed by the machine, then converted into more
power\...the immediate translation of mere Oriental matter into useful
substance]{.underline}.62 [This desire for order in the shadow of chaos
and uncertainty \-- the constant war with an intractable and volatile
matter \-- has deep roots in modern thought, and was a major impetus to
the development of technological reason and its supporting theories of
knowledge]{.underline}. As Kissinger\'s claims about the West\'s
Newtonian desire for the \'accurate\' gathering and classification of
\'data\' suggest, [modern strategy, foreign policy and Realpolitik have
been thrust deep into the apparently stable soil of natural science, in
the hope of finding immovable and unchallengeable roots
there]{.underline}. While this process has origins in ancient Judaic and
Greek thought, it crystallised in philosophical terms most powerfully
during and after the Renaissance. The key figures in this process were
Francis Bacon, Galileo, Isaac Newton, and René Descartes, who all
combined a hunger for political and ontological certainty, [a positivist
epistemology and a naïve faith in the goodness of
invention]{.underline}. Bacon sought to create certainty and order, and
with it a new human power over the world, through a new empirical
methodology based on a harmonious combination of experiment, the senses
and the understanding. With this method, he argued, we can \'derive hope
from a purer alliance of the faculties (the experimental and rational)
than has yet been attempted\'.63 In a similar move, Descartes sought to
conjure certainty from uncertainty through the application of a new
method that moved progressively out from a few basic certainties (the
existence of God, the certitude of individual consciousness and a
divinely granted faculty of judgement) in a search for pure fixed
truths. Mathematics formed the ideal image of this method, with its
strict logical reasoning, its quantifiable results and its uncanny
insights into the hidden structure of the cosmos.64 Earlier, Galileo had
argued that scientists should privilege \'objective\', quantifiable
qualities over \'merely perceptible\' ones; that \'only by means of an
exclusively quantitative analysis could science attain certain knowledge
of the world\'.65 [Such doctrines of mathematically verifiable truth
were to have powerful echoes in the 20th Century, in the ascendancy of
systems analysis, game theory, cybernetics and computing in defense
policy and strategic decisions, and in the awesome scientific
breakthroughs of nuclear physics, which unlocked the innermost secrets
of matter and energy and applied the most advanced applications of
mathematics and computing to create the atomic bomb]{.underline}. Yet
this new scientific power was marked by a terrible irony: as even
Morgenthau understood, [the control over matter afforded by the science
could never be translated into the control of the weapons themselves,
into political utility and rational strategy]{.underline}.66 Bacon
thought of the new scientific method not merely as way of achieving a
purer access to truth and epistemological certainty, but as liberating a
new power that would enable the creation of a new kind of ~~Man~~
\[human\]. He opened the Novum Organum with the statement that
\'knowledge and human power are synonymous\', and later wrote of his
\'determination\...to lay a firmer foundation, and extend to a greater
distance the boundaries of human power and dignity\'.67 In a revealing
and highly negative comparison between \'men \[and women\]\'s lives in
the most polished countries of Europe and in any wild and barbarous
region of the new Indies\' \-- one that echoes in advance Kissinger\'s
distinction between post-and pre-Newtonian cultures \-- Bacon set out
what was at stake in the advancement of empirical science: anyone making
this comparison, he remarked, \'will think it so great, that ~~man~~
\[humanity\] may be said to be a god unto ~~man~~ \[humanity\]\'.68 We
may be forgiven for blinking, but in Bacon\'s thought \'~~man~~
\[humanity\]\' was indeed in the process of stealing a new fire from the
heavens and seizing God\'s power over the world for itself. Not only
would the new empirical science lead to \'an improvement of mankind\'s
estate, and an increase in their power over nature\', but would reverse
the primordial humiliation of the Fall of Adam: For ~~man~~
\[humanity\], by the fall, lost at once ~~his~~ \[its\] state of
innocence, and his empire over creation, both of which can be partially
recovered even in this life, the first by religion and faith, the second
by the arts and sciences. For creation did not become entirely and
utterly rebellious by the curse, but in consequence of the Divine
decree, \'in the sweat of thy brow thou shalt eat bread\'; she is now
compelled by our labours (not assuredly by our disputes or magical
ceremonies) at length to afford mankind in some degree ~~his~~
\[humanity's\] bread\...69 [There is a breathtaking, world-creating
hubris in this statement \-- one that, in many ways, came to
characterise western modernity itself, and which is easily recognisable
in a generation of modern technocrats like Kissinger]{.underline}. The
Fall of Adam was the Judeo-Christian West\'s primal creation myth, one
that marked humankind as flawed and humbled before God, condemned to
hardship and ambivalence. Bacon forecast here a return to Eden, but one
of man\'s own making. [This truly was the death of God, of
putting]{.underline} ~~man~~ \[[humanity]{.underline}\] [into God\'s
place, and no pious appeals to the continuity or guidance of faith could
disguise the awesome epistemological violence which now subordinated
creation to]{.underline} ~~man~~ \[[humanity]{.underline}\]. Bacon
indeed argued that inventions are \'new creations and imitations of
divine works\'. As such, there is nothing but good in science: \'the
introduction of great inventions is the most distinguished of human
actions\...inventions are a blessing and a benefit without injuring or
afflicting any\'.70 And what would be mankind\'s \'bread\', the rewards
of its new \'empire over creation\'? [If the new method and invention
brought modern medicine, social welfare, sanitation, communications,
education and comfort, it also enabled the Armenian genocide, the
Holocaust and two world wars; napalm, the B52, the hydrogen bomb, the
Kalashnikov rifle and military strategy]{.underline}. Indeed [some of
the 20th Century\'s most far-reaching inventions]{.underline} \-- radar,
television, rocketry, computing, communications, jet aircraft, the
Internet \-- [would be the product of drives for national security and
militarisation]{.underline}. Even the inventions Bacon thought so
marvellous and transformative \-- printing, gunpowder and the compass
\-- brought in their wake upheaval and tragedy: printing, dogma and
bureaucracy; gunpowder, the rifle and the artillery battery; navigation,
[slavery and the genocide of indigenous peoples]{.underline}. In short,
[the legacy of the new empirical science would be ambivalence as much as
certainty; degradation as much as enlightenment; the destruction of
nature as much as its utilisation]{.underline}. Doubts and Fears:
Technology as Ontology If Bacon could not reasonably be expected to
foresee many of these developments, the idea that scientific and
technological progress could be destructive did occur to him. However it
was an anxiety he summarily dismissed: \...let none be alarmed at the
objection of the arts and sciences becoming depraved to malevolent or
luxurious purposes and the like, for the same can be said of every
worldly good; talent, courage, strength, beauty, riches, light
itself\...Only let \[hu\]mankind regain their rights over nature,
assigned to them by the gift of God, and obtain that power, whose
exercise will be governed by right reason and true religion.71 By the
mid-Twentieth Century, [after the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
such fears could no longer be so easily wished away]{.underline}, as the
physicist and scientific director of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert
Oppenheimer recognised. He said in a 1947 lecture: We felt a
particularly intimate responsibility for suggesting, for supporting and
in the end in large measure achieving the realization of atomic
weapons\...In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no
over-statement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin, and
this is a knowledge they cannot lose.72 Adam had fallen once more, but
into a world which refused to acknowledge its renewed intimacy with
contingency and evil. ~~Man's~~ \[[Humanity\'s]{.underline}\] [empire
over creation]{.underline} \-- ~~his~~ \[[its]{.underline}\] [discovery
of the innermost secrets of matter and energy, of the fires that fuelled
the stars \-- had not \'enhanced human power and dignity\']{.underline}
as Bacon claimed, [but instead brought destruction and
horror]{.underline}. [Scientific powers that had been consciously
applied in the defence of life and in the hope of its betterment now
threatened its total and absolute destruction]{.underline}. This would
not prevent a legion of scientists, soldiers and national security
policymakers later attempting to apply Bacon\'s faith in invention and
Descartes\' faith in mathematics to make of the Bomb a rational weapon.
Oppenheimer \-- who resolutely opposed the development of the hydrogen
bomb \-- understood what the strategists could not: that [the weapons
resisted control, resisted utility, that \'with the release of atomic
energy quite revolutionary changes had occurred in the techniques of
warfare\']{.underline}.73 Yet Bacon\'s legacy, one deeply imprinted on
the strategists, was his view that truth and utility are \'perfectly
identical\'.74 In 1947 Oppenheimer had clung to the hope that
\'knowledge is good\...it seems hard to live any other way than thinking
it was better to know something than not to know it; and the more you
know, the better\'; by 1960 he felt that \'terror attaches to new
knowledge. It has an unmooring quality; it finds men unprepared to deal
with it.\'75 Martin [Heidegger questioned this mapping of natural
science onto the social world in his essays on technology]{.underline}
\-- which, as \'machine\', has been so crucial to modern strategic and
geopolitical thought as an image of perfect function and order and a
powerful tool of intervention. He commented that, given that modern
technology \'employs exact physical science\...the deceptive illusion
arises that modern technology is applied physical science\'.76 Yet as
the essays and speeches of Oppenheimer attest, technology and its
relation to science, society and war cannot be reduced to a noiseless
series of translations of science for politics, knowledge for force, or
force for good. Instead, Oppenheimer saw a process frustrated by
roadblocks and ruptured by irony; in his view [there was no smooth,
unproblematic translation of scientific truth into social truth, and
technology was not its vehicle]{.underline}. Rather his comments raise
profound and painful ethical questions that resonate with terror and
uncertainty. Yet this has not prevented technology becoming a potent
object of desire, not merely as an instrument of power but as a promise
and conduit of certainty itself. In the minds of too many rational
soldiers, strategists and policymakers, technology brings with it the
truth of its enabling science and spreads it over the world. [It turns
epistemological certainty into political certainty; it turns control
over \'facts\' into control over the earth. Heidegger\'s insights into
this phenomena I find especially telling and disturbing \-- because they
underline the ontological force of the instrumental view of
politics]{.underline}. In The Question Concerning Technology,
Heidegger\'s striking argument was that [in the modernising West
technology is not merely a tool, a \'means to an end\'. Rather
technology has become a governing image of the modern universe, one that
has come to order, limit and define human existence as a \'calculable
coherence of forces\' and a \'standing reserve\' of energy]{.underline}.
Heidegger wrote: [\'the threat to]{.underline} ~~man~~ [\[humanity\]
does not come in the first instance from the potentially lethal machines
and apparatus of technology. The actual threat has already
affected]{.underline} ~~man~~ \[[humanity]{.underline}\]
[in]{.underline} ~~his~~ [\[its\] essence]{.underline}.\'77 [This
process Heidegger calls \'Enframing\' and through it the scientific mind
demands that \'nature reports itself in some way or other that is
identifiable through calculation and remains orderable as a system of
information\']{.underline}. ~~Man~~ \[Humanity\] is not a being who
makes and uses machines as means, choosing and limiting their impact on
the world for his ends; rather ~~man~~ \[[humanity]{.underline}\] [has
imagined the world as a machine and humanity everywhere becomes trapped
within its logic]{.underline}. ~~Man~~ \[[Humanity]{.underline}\], he
writes, [\'comes to the very brink of a precipitous
fall]{.underline}\...where ~~he himself~~ \[[it itself]{.underline}\]
[will have to be taken as standing-reserve]{.underline}. Meanwhile
~~Man~~ \[[humanity]{.underline}\], [precisely as the one so threatened,
exalts himself to the posture of lord of the earth]{.underline}.\'78
[Technological]{.underline} ~~man~~ [\[humanity\] not only becomes the
name for a project of lordship and mastery over the earth, but
incorporates humanity within this project as a calculable
resource]{.underline}. [In strategy, warfare and geopolitics human
bodies, actions and aspirations are caught, transformed and perverted by
such calculating, enframing reason: human lives are reduced to tools,
obstacles, useful or obstinate matter]{.underline}. [This tells us much
about the enduring power of crude instrumental versions of strategic
thought, which relate not merely to the actual use of force but to
broader geopolitical strategies that see]{.underline}, as limited war
theorists like Robert Osgood did, [force as an \'instrument of policy
short of war\']{.underline}. It was from within this strategic ontology
that figures like the Nobel prize-winning economist Thomas Schelling
theorised the strategic role of threats and coercive diplomacy, and
spoke of strategy as \'the power to hurt\'.79 In the 2006 Lebanon war we
can see such thinking in the remark of a U.S. analyst, a former
Ambassador to Israel and Syria, who speculated that by targeting
civilians and infrastructure Israel aimed \'to create enough pain on the
ground so there would be a local political reaction to Hezbollah\'s
adventurism\'.80 Similarly a retired Israeli army colonel told the
Washington Post that \'Israel is attempting to create a rift between the
Lebanese population and Hezbollah supporters by exacting a heavy price
from the elite in Beirut. The message is: If you want your air
conditioning to work and if you want to be able to fly to Paris for
shopping, you must pull your head out of the sand and take action toward
shutting down Hezbollah-land.\'81

### AT: Discourse =/= Reality 

#### Securitization assimilates subjects through speech repetition

**Oren and Solomon 15** (Ido Oren, associate professor and chair of the
Department of Political Science at the University of Florida, PhD in
political science from the University of Chicago, Ty Solomon, lecturer
in international relations at the University of Glasgow, PhD in
international relations from the University of Florida, April 2015,
"WMD, WMD, WMD: Securitization through ritualized incantation of
ambiguous phrases," *Review of International Studies* Volume 41 Issue 2)

In this article, [we want to push back against the retreat from a speech
act-centered understanding of securitisation]{.underline}. It is not
that we reject the criticisms articulated by the scholars who champion
more process-oriented and/or nonlinguistic approaches to securitisation.
We share their concerns that the Copenhagen School has 'undertheorized'
the role of the audience and that the Copenhagen School 'would need a
clearer and more elaborated theory of the securitizing act', a theory
that would 'say more about the relative status of the idea of a security
utterance or speech act event as opposed to the idea of an
intersubjectivity of actor and audience or the process of
securitization'.16 Yet [rather than join the critics in moving 'beyond
the speech act', we instead seek to reinvigorate Wæver\'s insight that
'the utterance \["security"\] itself is the act']{.underline}.17 We
seek, in other words, to rise to the challenge of providing a 'clearer
and more elaborated theory of the securitizing act'.18

In the bulk of the article we thus present a novel theoretical account
demonstrating how [securitisation can be understood as an illocutionary
act even as it entails a social process]{.underline}. We conceptualise
the speech of securitising actors as consisting not in 'an argument
about the priority and urgency of an existential threat' so much as in
repetitive spouting of ambiguous phrases such as 'weapons of mass
destruction'.19 We propose, further, that [the acceptance of this
oft-repeated utterance by an audience consists not in becoming
'convinced' or 'persuaded' so much as in the audience echoing the
phrase, joining in a chorus-like fashion with the securitising actor to
produce a repetitive, ritualised chant]{.underline}.20 In our
formulation, then, [the audience is not being performed to]{.underline}
-- it is not akin to theater spectators who sit inertly in their seats
during the play before applauding the stage performers at the end of the
evening. [The audience rather partakes in the production of a 'political
spectacle']{.underline};21 [it comes to actively participate in the
performance]{.underline} in the manner in which the hearers of a
percussion ensemble are moved to tap their fingers and sway their bodies
along with the drumbeat. Just as the rhythmic beating of drums creates a
sense of unity even as the minds of individual hearers/performers may
wander in diverse directions, so does [the collective incantation of
ambiguous phrases by speakers and audiences construct a sense of social
oneness even as]{.underline} (or rather because) [the chanters lack
consensus about the meaning or policy implications of the phrase.
Successful securitisation]{.underline}, we argue, [may be performed
through the collective chanting of a phrase that becomes itself the
existential threat it ostensibly refers to]{.underline}. In sum, [we
conceptualise securitisation as a ritual process involving the
simultaneous interweaving of linguistic repetitions with speakers\' and
audiences\' material performance, collectively 'chanting' the phrase to
construct a securitised threat]{.underline}.

To illustrate our theoretical account we discuss an empirical case we
have already alluded to: the securitisation of Iraq in the United States
in 2002--3, that is, the elevation of the Iraqi issue to the level of
'panic politics' or of 'supreme priority' that calls for 'extraordinary
means', including war.22 [During the run-up to the invasion of Iraq the
Bush administration spouted forth]{.underline}, as US Senator Lincoln
Chafee (Republican, Rhode Island) put it, [a 'steady drumbeat of weapons
of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction, weapons of mass
destruction']{.underline}.23 Soon enough [this phrase became contagious,
ceaselessly reverberating throughout the US media]{.underline}. Even as
the meaning of the term was historically variable, ambiguous, and
multivocal, and even as many Americans have not heard it before,
'weapons of mass destruction' became so ubiquitous that it was selected
America\'s 2002 'word of the year'.24 [The ritualistic choral chanting
of this phrase by the administration, the media, and the public
constructed, we argue, a heightened generalised sense of danger even as
many of the chanters did not necessarily support the invasion of Iraq.
The collective incantation of the utterance 'weapons of mass
destruction' ultimately produced the grave Iraqi threat that it
ostensibly described]{.underline}.

### AT: "Master's Tools"

#### Using the master's tools to bring down the master's house is ineffective, because in the era of globalization, the master has an infinite number of houses through a network of colonization that has no center. 

**Koopman '11** (Sara, Assistant prof of Geography at York University,
"Let's Take Peace to Pieces", Political Geography Volume 30 Issue 4)

Megoran calls for political geographers to not simply to study but to
*build* peace, and offers eight examples of ways that geographers are
already doing so -- yet these seem limited to me. There is a great deal
of work done in geography that is *for* peace if we understand peace as
more than not-war (e.g. geographies of responsibility, of solidarity, or
of struggles for the right to the city). But if peace is broad enough to
encompass all of this, is the term useful? Geographers have not seemed
to think so. Peace is not one of the 'Key Concepts in Geography'
(Holloway, Rice, & Valentine, 2003), nor even one of the 'Key Concepts
in Political Geography' (Gallaher, Dahlman, Gilmartin, Mountz, &
Shirlow, 2008) -- nor is it defined in the 'Dictionary of Human
Geography' (Gregory, Johnston, Pratt, Watts, Whatmore, 2009), nor the
'International Encyclopedia of Human Geography' (Thrift & Kitchin,
2009), nor the recent 'SAGE Handbook of Geographical Knowledge' (Agnew &
Livingstone, 2011). Peace is not to be found in the index of most
geography textbooks, even critical ones on geopolitics and political
geography ( \[Agnew et al., 2007\] and \[Ó Tuathail et al., 2006\] ). To
be fair, there would not be much for review texts to cite, for little
work has been done by geographers directly using the word peace --
though a great deal of critical geography is both about and for peace,
understood more broadly. Is it worth attaching the term peace to that
sort of work? Yes and no. [If the term peace is used but left undefined
it is too often assumed as a universal across time and place, and
sentimentally idealized as either simply not-war, or all that is
good]{.underline}. Megoran argues that peace is more than the antonym of
war, but does not speak to how the two are entangled. Life goes on in
the midst of violent conflict. Children go to school, people fall in
love -- and they organize for justice. Foucault (2003, p. 50) argues
that [war is inside peace, that war is the motor of institutions and
order. But peace too is inside war. The two are intertwined, and we
cannot understand one without the other. If ever there was a clear line
between war and peace, it is all the more blurred]{.underline}, [Gregory
(2010)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629811000667#ref_bib10)
argues, by ['late modern war', which has no clearly defined beginning or
end in place or time.]{.underline} Seeing peace and war as
all-or-nothing opposites is the sort of thinking that either makes
people give up on ever achieving peace or focus just on studying war,
thinking that all it takes for peace is to end war. [To unsettle 'peace'
by exposing how it is both portrayed and visualized, as well as
practiced and materialized, is not just an intellectual exercise but an
integral part of creating peace itself]{.underline}. I fully agree then
with Megoran that is important to question how peace is and has been
defined, though I am far more interested in how peacemakers have defined
it than how geographers have. I am afraid that Megoran himself leans to
reproducing the idea that there is one right definition of peace out
there if we just dig hard enough to find it, even as he looks at how it
has been defined differently. He gives more attention to Biblical
Studies than to Peace Studies, and implies that there is one overarching
definition of peace in the bible. Of course religion and philosophy have
been asking what peace is for millennia, but after the Second World War
the field of peace studies was formed to focus entirely on this issue.
There are now encyclopedias ( \[Cuéllar and Cho, 1999\] and \[Kurtz,
2008\] ) of the major concepts in the field. These include various sorts
of peace, from liberal to feminist to Gaia peace (Groff, 2010). Megoran
gives the breadth of the field of peace studies short shrift. Megoran
does focus on the "father" of Peace Studies: Johan Galtung, who founded
the Peace Research Institute of Oslo in 1958. [Galtung first argued that
negative peace was the absence of direct violence, i.e. bodily harm, and
positive peace was the absence of structural violence, i.e. social
structures with life-shortening consequences]{.underline}. What Megoran
fails to mention is that twenty years later [Galtung added a third type
of violence, cultural violence, i.e. the ideas used to legitimize both
direct and structural violence]{.underline}. Positive peace, Galtung
(1996) now argues, is the absence of both structural and cultural
violence. Ironically though, even in Galtung's 'positive peace' peace is
defined by what it is not. Other arguments about what peace means have
been advanced in peace studies. Goetschel and Hagmann (2009) argue that
[a 'peacebuilding consensus' has formed in diplomatic circles which uses
technocratic interpretations of positive peace that impose a top-down
liberal peace as a benevolent response funded by Western countries. They
call this 'donor peace' and argue that it is not only paternalistic but
hides an economic liberalization agenda that links peace to capitalist
development]{.underline}. Not defining peace makes it susceptible to
these uses. [They argue for re-politicizing the term by facing the
"thorny question of what peace means for different social groups in a
particular place and time"]{.underline} (2009, p. 64). Dietrich and
Sützl (1997) put forward "A Call for Many Peaces" in which they argue
that without being based in concrete places peace is simply an
abstraction, and that to argue for just 'one peace' is intellectual
violence. They imply that peace can only be conceived, and achieved, on
a small scale. I disagree that peace can only be achieved on a small
scale, but it seems clear that peace means different things at different
scales, as well as to different groups, and at different times and
places. [Peace is not the same everywhere anymore than war is. When
peace is portrayed as a mythical singular it becomes so abstract as to
be unobtainable, an issue best left to philosophers. Or perhaps it
becomes so unspecified that it is open to manipulation by politicians
and attached to violent pacification. I want to argue for taking peace
to pieces, not just by place, but also space. Peace(s) are always shaped
in and through the spaces and times through which they are made. Peace
is not a static thing, nor an endpoint, but a socio-spatial relation
that is always made and made again]{.underline} (Agnew, 2009). [Is peace
made through a network, a hierarchy, or in rooms? If we imagine peace as
something delivered by men in suits in a negotiation room, what role can
we play? If we imagine space as simply a container, what can we do to,
and in, it? To take peace to pieces requires both understanding space as
a doing, and grounded contextual definitions of peace.]{.underline} This
has become particularly clear to me in my own research on international
protective accompaniers in Colombia (Koopman, 2011). Accompaniers are
generally people with citizenship privilege (i.e., from North America
and Europe) who, as they put it, 'make space for peace' by walking
alongside Colombian peacemakers who are under threat. I have been
discussing with accompaniers their practices and productions of space,
how these use privilege, and how they understand that their work
produces peace. Accompaniment is a very particular form of peacemaking,
but I want to learn from different, as [McConnell and Williams (in
press)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629811000667#ref_bib18)
put it, situated knowledges of peace. [They call for geographers to
research more "sites and scales, to show how peace is differentially
constructed, materialized and interpreted through space and time".
Geographers are particularly well placed to connect the various
experiences and experiments in peacemaking around the world in
'non-innocent conversations]{.underline}' (Haraway, 1992) [that
acknowledge that peace(s) are shaped by the spaces they are made in. As
geographers we can draw counter-topographical contour lines]{.underline}
(Katz, 2001) [that see connections and weave the peace(s)
together.]{.underline} But do these experiments have to actually use the
word 'peace'? Williams and McConnell (in press) "propose a more
expansive and critical focus around 'peace-full' concepts such as
tolerance, friendship, hope, reconciliation, justice, humanitarianism,
cosmopolitanism, resistance, solidarity, hospitality, care and empathy".
But do these words stand in for peace? [The terms human rights, human
security, and human development likewise are used instead of
peace.]{.underline} Perhaps this is because the term peace can be vague,
broad, amorphous and mythical. So then is it worth using the term peace?
I want to argue that it is, *if* we define it as more than not-war, and
always in grounded contextual ways. Rather than using it *instead* of
other terms, I want to argue for adding it to existing conversations.
Though it overlaps, it is a wider concept than justice or security or
solidarity -- one that can encompass these and more. Using the term
peace also allows for a different sort of thinking. [Security is
traditionally understood to be kept at the national scale, and human
security is measured at the individual scale, but generally understood
to be kept by nations, IGOs and NGOs. Peace, meanwhile, can be
experienced as both intimate and global. Peace can be created at an
individual, family, neighborhood, community, and other scales, and using
the term can foster seeing these scales as intertwined and mutually
constitutive. One of the best ways we can work *for* peace is to
recognize that much of what critical geographers are already looking at
is *about* peacemaking, broadly understood. Using the term peace, even
with various definitions of the term, allows us to connect these
peacemaking projects around the world. As geographers we are well placed
not only to take peace to pieces, but also to connect the
peace(s).]{.underline}

### AT: Paradigm Wars

#### Our method doesn't devolve into paradigm wars but rather creates space for the creation of counterhegemonic practices

**Calkivik 10** (Emine Asli Calkivik, PhD in political science from the
University of Minnesota, October 2010, "Dismantling Security,"
https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/99479/Calkivik_umn_0130E_11576.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)

In the following section, I will turn to a discussion of four proposals
offered by critical security scholars who have voiced deep discontent
with security and who have engaged with the question of thinking past
security. Through an exegesis of these proposals, [I will try to expose
the way in which these critics end up securing security's foundational
status]{.underline} while suggesting ways beyond or out of security.
[This exercise is not intended to be another attempt to outperform
critical critics]{.underline}.97 [Rather, my aim is to point out to "a
problem of imaginative incapacity]{.underline}"98 that afflicts these
debates and to highlight the striking paradox of always re-inscribing
security as a foundation for thought and action---[all the while
problematizing the way in which it leads to exclusions, entrenches
existing hierarchies, and reproduces relations of power and
domination]{.underline}. I want to clarify what dismantling security
entails as a call that attempts to take the critical security project to
its conclusion by asking a question that haunts the debates, yet, is
never posed.

### AT: Particularity Good

**Their appeal to contingent explanations of conflict displaces the
violent imperative at the heart of civil society in which the
biopolitical positioning of bodies serves as an omnipresent condition
for the destruction of bodies marked outside of the model of proper
citizenship -- only the alternative's structural account of military
subject formation can solve**

**Deer '16** (Patrick, Associate Professor of English at New York
University, "Mapping Contemporary American War Culture", College
Literature Volume 43, Number 1, Winter 2016)

[The greatest challenge for]{.underline} cultural [critics]{.underline}
or writers seeking [to understand this slippery terrain]{.underline}, I
would suggest, [comes with equating war culture with a dominant culture
defined by militarism, rather than as a more uneven process of
militarization of the general culture. Militarism]{.underline}, as
historian John Gillis has observed, [is]{.underline} an older concept
[typically "defined as either the dominance of the military over
civilian authority, or, more generally, as the prevalence of warlike
values in a society]{.underline}" (1989, 1). [For this reason,
militarism is a term that tends to be applied to the other side in
wartime, becoming a convenient "way of displacing responsibility and
blame"]{.underline} (1--2). [To understand America's recent war
culture]{.underline}, I would suggest, [we are better served by thinking
in terms of the more recent and messier concept of militarization, which
"does not imply the formal dominance of the military or the triumph of a
particular ideology" (1). **Militarization**]{.underline}, by contrast,
has been influentially defined by Michael Geyer [**as "the**
contradictory and tense **social process in which civil society
organizes itself for the production of violence**]{.underline}" (1989,
79). The advantage of [the idea of militarization]{.underline} is that
it [challenges our conventional ideas about the relationship between the
state, its military institutions, and civil society, **which see them as
separate spheres into which war erupts from the outside** from
particular sources or **at particular moments**]{.underline} (Geyer
78--79). For this reason, Geyer argues, "[in order to avoid these
mystifications we must move from the delineation of the 'sites' of
militarization to the analytic recovery of the 'process' of
militarization"]{.underline} (78). As [Catherine Lutz has argued, this
social process has far reaching implications: **Militarization is
intimately connected** not only to the obvious---the increasing size of
armies and the resurgence of militant nationalisms and militant
fundamentalisms---but also **to the less visible deformation of human
potentials into the hierarchies of race, class, gender, and sexuality,
and** to the **shaping of** national **histories** in ways that glorify
and legitimate military action]{.underline}. (Lutz 2004, 320) As Lutz
persuasively argued in Homefront, her remarkable study of Fayetteville,
NC, and its vast US Army base Fort Bragg, [militarization]{.underline}
also [depends on the masking and censoring of longer historical
continuities: Much of the history and contemporary reality of war and
war preparation has been invisible]{.underline} . . . to people both
inside and outside the military--- [because it has been shrouded behind
simplified histories or propaganda, cordoned off by secrecy laws, or
been difficult to assess because so many consequences of running our
military institutions are not obviously war-related]{.underline}. And so
we have looked away from the costs of being a country ever ready for
battle. The international costs are even more invisible as Americans
have looked away from the face of empire and been taught to think of war
with a distancing focus---"freedom assured" or "aggressors
deterred"---rather than the melted, exploded, raped and lacerated bodies
and destroyed social world at its center. (Lutz 2001, 2) [Because of its
voracious claims upon us as citizens and its struggle to monopolize the
cultural field, **tracing** the logic of **militarization and war
culture inextricably involves** us in **wider questions of politics and
economics**, of **biopolitics and neoliberalism**]{.underline}. As Matt
Davies and Simon Philpott have argued: Militarization impacts every
aspect of daily life, enriching and rewarding some individuals,
interests, regions and nations, immiserating and punishing others. It
reconfigures relations of class, gender and sex, and is profoundly
racist. However, [it is also highly productive of abstract notions of
citizenship and]{.underline} patriotism and is a powerful producer of
[historical narratives]{.underline}, particularly those [**that serve to
justify** and legitimize **not just the use of violence** in global
affairs **but also** the **economic and social organization of the
polity required to produce the capability for such
violence**]{.underline}. (Davies and Philpott 2012, 49)

#### **The perm proves the link -- creating legal limitations on the modes and actors of war clings to the myth of distinct times of peace and war and maintains cruel optimism in the plan as an act of disarmament**

**Margulies 12** (Joseph, Northwestern University, Humanities and Social
Science Online, The Myth of Wartime,
http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=35306)

[After]{.underline} the attacks of [September 11, it became popular to
describe]{.underline} what was thought of as [the typical American
response to war: the nation is thrown off course at the onset of a
military emergency but gradually steers back to a peacetime norm once
the threat recedes.]{.underline}\[1\] [It is **the great myth of
deviation and redemption.**]{.underline} It imagines a sudden and
violent storm, when the Ship of State is tempest-toss'd by buffeting
gales of savage hatred, until such time as the seas finally calm and the
country begins the long, difficult journey back to more familiar waters.
[Like any national myth, this one serves an important purpose in
American life. It **allows Americans to comfort themselves**
that]{.underline} whatever [transgressions]{.underline} may occur
[during these periods are]{.underline} both [aberrational and temporary.
Wartime is a cosmic Get Out of Jail Free card, when all is forgiven
because everything has changed, which comes in handy if you go to war a
lot.]{.underline} But like any myth, [the myth of deviation and
redemption suffers if we study it]{.underline} too
[closely.]{.underline} For one thing, it cannot account for continued
forays into a repressive wilderness even after the threat has subsided.
Yet what one scholar has called "the terrorism narrative" is at least as
potent today as it was immediately after September 11, even though the
consensus of the intelligence community is that [the threat
from]{.underline} transnational jihad in general and [al
Qaeda]{.underline} in particular, [while always overblown, has now been
substantially reduced.]{.underline}\[2\] Nor does the myth take into
consideration the possibility that partisan pressures might nourish and
sustain wartime impulses long past the point justified by any sober
assessment of the risk to national security. Yet we know the Cold War
lasted far longer and cut far deeper into the fabric of American life
precisely because of partisan pressure, and that the same thing is
taking place during the war on terror.\[3\] In other words, the myth
requires that we suspend what we know to be true in just about every
other aspect of our lives\--viz., that our understanding of reality is
largely constructed and that partisanship matters. These illustrations
help train our thinking on [the myth's]{.underline} essential [flaw. It
imagines that wartime is a **fixed** and **recognizable** period, that
it is a **statement of fact rather than a state of mind.** And this
is]{.underline} indeed [the widely held belief.]{.underline} To be sure,
the courts have recognized for many years that [the transition from war
to peace is **better imagined as a dimmer than a light
switch.**]{.underline} The issue arises now and again when someone
complains that he should not be subject to this or that wartime rule
because the shooting stopped a long time ago. Courts do not take kindly
to these claims. The case law includes a lot of throat-clearing about
"winding down," along with the occasional observation that love and war
apparently have at least this much in common: it's usually easier to
know when things start than when they end. But apart from this, [people
seem to **think** they know when the country is "at war" and when it is
not.]{.underline} [Wartime is a condition that comes round now and
again.]{.underline} We all know when it begins, when it ends, and where
it happens, or so the story goes. But for at least two generations in
the United States, "wartime" has been nothing like what the myth
imagines it to be, and grows less so as the seasons pass and the wars
accumulate. In Wartime: An Idea, Its History, Its Consequences, the
legal historian Mary Dudziak has taken a closer look at the entire
conceptual category. A slim and engaging volume, wonderfully written and
carefully wrought, Wartime is a fascinating meditation on the perils of
clinging to a myth of national identity that increasingly bears only a
glancing resemblance to modern life. Particularly [since the Cold War,
"wartime" has been]{.underline} pretty near [**all the time.** It
is]{.underline}, as Dudziak writes, ["not an exception to normal
peacetime, but an enduring condition"]{.underline} (p. 4). And at least
since President George W. Bush launched the "war on terror," it's also
everywhere, unbounded not only in time (since no one knows what victory
over an ideology looks like) but also in space (since ideologies have a
way of taking root in the darnedest places). [Many writers have made a
similar point and the concern that wartime initiatives will last beyond
the emergency]{.underline} that summoned them forth [is a familiar
complaint.]{.underline} [But]{.underline} Professor
[Dudziak]{.underline}, a professor of law, history, and political
science at the University of Southern California, [goes significantly
beyond prior discussions by focusing our attention not on the risk of
normalization, which is serious enough, but **on the very idea that
wartime remains a**]{.underline}n identifiable **[category, recognizably
separate from whatever might be its opposite.]{.underline}** [The
problem is **not simply** that we may come to accept]{.underline} roving
[wiretaps as part of the "normal" landscape of life]{.underline} (i.e.,
that we will tolerate them [even when we are "at peace"]{.underline}),
[but that we will come to tolerate the idea that we are always "at war"
and therefore eternally prepared to accept all manner of]{.underline}
ostensibly [exceptional measures because we **cling to the myth that war
is temporary and aberrational.**]{.underline} The concern, in short, is
that [the myth to which we have grown so attached has outlasted its
relevance]{.underline} to the American experience. [It has decayed from
myth]{.underline} (which has at least a passing resemblance to the
truth), [to fantasy]{.underline} (which is nothing more than truth as we
would wish it). Though Professor Dudziak does not put things in
precisely these terms, that is the implication of her account, and it is
an exceptionally valuable insight.

Criticizing the Hubcaps while the Juggernaut Rolls On [The U.S.

[immense]{.underline} as to defy comprehension. [Even those]{.underline}
few [paying attention tend to focus on **one small piece at a

[nuclear **weapons**]{.underline} with certain new capabilities. [Then
the attention may shift to missile defense-- but]{.underline} there too,
[only a small part of the program]{.underline} attracts public debate,
[with]{.underline} immense [programs like the]{.underline} [airborne

for]{.underline} the intensive [militarization of space]{.underline}
like the Space Plane [come to light for a day or two]{.underline},
[attracting a **brief** flurry of interest]{.underline}; the continuing,
broad development of military space technologies, from GPS-aided
guidance to radiation hardened microchips to space power generation,
draw even less scrutiny. There is so broad a consensus among political
elites supporting the constant refinement of conventional armaments that
new generations of strike aircraft, Navy ships, and armored vehicles
attract little notice outside industry and professional circles, with
only spectacular cost overruns or technical failures likely to draw the
occasional headline. [A few Congresspeople will]{.underline} [challenge
one or another particularly extreme new]{.underline}
[weapon]{.underline} (e.g. the "Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator"), [but
usually on]{.underline} narrow [pragmatic]{.underline} [grounds: we can
accomplish the same "mission"]{.underline} [with less risky or cheaper
weapons. But the]{.underline} [question of "why," seldom is asked, only
"how,"]{.underline} or "how much does it cost?" Most of [the
programs]{.underline} [that constitute the military machine glide
silently onward undisturbed,]{.underline} like the body of a missile
submarine invisible below the deceptively small surfaces that rise above
the sea. The United States emerged after both World War II and the Cold
War as the most powerful state on earth\-- the one with the most
choices. The first time, all of this was still new. We could perhaps
understand our ever deeper engagement with the machinery of death as a
series of tragic events, of the inevitable outcome of fallible humans
grappling with the titanic forces they had only recently unleashed, in
the context of a global confrontation layered in secrecy, ideology, and
fear. But this time around, since the end of the Cold War, [we must see
the United States as truly **choosing**, with every new weapon and every
new war, to lead the world into a **renewed spiral towards
catastrophe**]{.underline}. The past is written, but our understanding
of it changes from moment to moment. The United States began the nuclear
age as the most powerful nation on earth, and proclaimed the character
of the "American Century" with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a
cryptic message written in the blood of innocents. Its meaning has come
clear over fifty years of technocratic militarism, punctuated by the
deaths of millions in neo-colonial warfare and underscored always by the
willingness to end the world rather than share power with anyone. [The
path ahead still can be changed, but we must begin with an understanding
of where we are, and how we got here.]{.underline} In the United States,
there is a very long way to go before we have a debate about the uses of
military force that addresses honestly the weapons we have and seek to
develop, much less about the complex social forces which impel the
United States to maintain its extraordinary levels of forces and
armaments. Most Americans don't know what their government is doing in
their name, or why. Their government, regardless of the party in power,
lies about both its means and its ends on a routine basis. And there is
nothing the government lies about more than nuclear weapons, proclaiming
to the world for the last decade that the United States was
disassembling its nuclear facilities and leading the way to disarmament,
while rebuilding its nuclear weapons plants and planning for another
half century and more of nuclear dominance.74 It is clear by now that
[fighting violence with yet more violence]{.underline}, claiming to stop
the spread of nuclear weapons by threatening the use of nuclear weapons,
[is a dead end.]{.underline} [The very notion of
"enforcement,"]{.underline} that some countries have the right to judge
and punish others for seeking "weapons of mass destruction," [has become
an excuse for war making, a cover and justification for the power and
profit agenda of secretive and undemocratic elites. The only solution
that will increase the security of ordinary people anywhere is for all
of us]{.underline}, in our respective societies, [to do
everything]{.underline} we can [to get]{.underline} [the most violent
elements in our cultures-- whether in or out of uniform-- under
control.]{.underline} In the United States, [this will require far more
than changing a few faces in Washington. We will need a genuine peace
movement, ready to make connections to]{.underline} movements for
[ecological balance,]{.underline} and for [social]{.underline} [and
economic justice]{.underline}, and by doing so [to address]{.underline}
[the causes of war. Before we can expect others to join us, it must be
clear that we are leaving the path of violence.]{.underline}

**Cady '10** (Duane L., prof of phil @ hamline university, From Warism
to Pacifism: A Moral Continuum, pp. 23-24)

[The slow but persistent rise in awareness of racial, ethnic,
gender]{.underline}, [sexual- orientation, and class oppression in our
time and the beginning]{.underline} [efforts of liberation from within
oppressed groups offer hope that even]{.underline} the most [deeply
held]{.underline} and least explicitly challenged [predispositions
of]{.underline} [culture might be examined. Such examinations can lead
to changes]{.underline} in the lives of the oppressed. [Perhaps even
those oppressed by warism]{.underline} [will one day free themselves
from accepting war as an inevitable condition of nature]{.underline}.
[Two hundred years ago slavery was]{.underline} a [common]{.underline}
and well- established social institution in the United States. [It had
been]{.underline} an [ordinary]{.underline} feature of many societies
dating to ancient and perhaps prehistoric times. [Slavery was taken for
granted as a natural condition for beings thought to]{.underline} [be
inferior]{.underline} to members of the dominant group. [And slavery was
considered an essential feature of our nation's economy]{.underline}.
Within the past two centuries, [attitudes toward slavery have changed
dramatically]{.underline}. [With]{.underline} these [fundamental shifts
in normative lenses came fundamental shifts]{.underline} [in the
practice and legality of slavery.]{.underline} These changes have been
as difficult as they have been dramatic, for former slaves, for former
slave- holders, and for culture at large. [While deep racial prejudices
persist]{.underline} [to this day, slavery is no longer
tolerated]{.underline} in modern societies. Slavery- like conditions of
severe economic exploitation of labor have become embarrassments to
dominant groups in part because [slavery is universally condemned. The
point is that the most **central values** of cultures---]{.underline}
[thought to be essential to the very survival of the society and
allegedly]{.underline} [grounded in the natural conditions of
creation---can change in **fundamental** ways in relatively **short**
periods of time with profound implications for]{.underline} individuals
and [societies]{.underline}. John Dewey beautifully links this point to
the consideration of warism: "[War is as much a social
pattern]{.underline} \[for us\] [as]{.underline} was the domestic
[slavery which the ancients thought to be]{.underline} [immutable
fact."]{.underline}9 The civil rights movement has helped us see that
human worth is not determined by a racial hierarchy. Feminism has helped
us realize again that dominant attitudes about people are more likely
values we choose rather than innate and determined features of human
nature. It is historically true that men have been more actively violent
and have received more training and encouragement in violence than have
women.10 Dominant attitudes of culture have explained this by reference
to what is "natural" for males and "natural" for females. By questioning
the traditional role models for men and women, all of us be- come more
free to choose and create the selves we are to be; we need not be
defined by hidden presumptions of gender roles. [Parallel to racial and
gender liberation movements, pacifism questions taking warism for
granted. Pacifists seek an examination of our]{.underline} [unquestioned
assumption of warism to expose it as racism and sexism]{.underline}
[have been examined and exposed.]{.underline} Just as opponents of
racism and sex- ism consider the oppression of nonwhites and women,
respectively, to be wrong, and thus to require fundamental changes in
society, so opponents of warism--- pacifists of various sorts---
consider war to be wrong, and thus to require fundamental changes in
society.

### AT: Public Checks

#### Bottom-up securitization means the public is a multiplier not a check -- also proves try or die for the alt because only contesting subjectivity at a micro-level solves

**Calkivik 10** (Emine Asli Calkivik, PhD in political science from the
University of Minnesota, October 2010, "Dismantling Security,"

Perhaps [just as alarming is the proliferation of the phenomenon of
vigilante-citizens, as subjects around the globe take the law into their
hands to secure themselves against gangs, drugs, and "illegal
aliens]{.underline}." [One of the paradigmatic examples of this
"statecraft from below" is civilian border patrol groups such as the
Minutemen Project, founded]{.underline} in California in 2004 by a
retired businessman [to police the U.S.-Mexico border against the
so-called invasion by immigrants]{.underline}.9 As Doty explains, with
undocumented migration becoming an increasingly prominent issue and the
filling up of media outlets with news of humans referred to as "aliens"
being trafficked across borders, [ordinary citizens respond to calls
from private groups to take action and form their own unofficial,
unauthorized, but not necessarily illegal patrolling of borders. The
global army that security enlists in its service is not situated merely
at the borders of national territories and identities, however. Across
the globe, there are many private patrol groups that are formed to clamp
down on local crime, monitor other illicit and unwanted
behavior]{.underline}. Depicting this trend as "both a logical response
and an integral aspect" of the global political order wrought by
neoliberalism, Pratten and Sen provide ample proof of the rising tide of
vigilante-style justice and violence as a global phenomenon.10

It could be said that [the obsession with security is democratized to
the extent that it has become a common language, a
"vernacular]{.underline}"11 [shared across topographies of global
hierarchies]{.underline}. The post-Cold War jubilation in countries that
have witnessed political liberation and economic liberalization has been
accompanied by the emergence of an overwhelming fear of crime and a
desire for security.12 [As the global security agenda was
transmogrifying toward an obsession with securing the life of the
species]{.underline},13 [eagerness to criminalize dystopic social
phenomenon such as poverty became a global phenomenon: zero tolerance
policies turned into wars on urban squatters, practically evolving into
an active "dictatorship over the poor]{.underline}."14

### AT: Reactionary Security Worse

#### The aff's claim to shift from reactionary to structural security is non-unique and disavows the omnipresent nature of global control as the motor of the modern political economy- they participate in the ultimate failure of critical security studies and are invest in violent process of Western subject formation 

**Richmond '15** (Oliver, International Relations prof at University of
Manchester, "Security cosmopolitanism or 'securitopia': an ontological
trap and a half-hearted response to structural war?" Critical Studies on
Security 2015 Vol. 3, No. 2, pgs. 182-184)

Anthony Burke has written an important piece: yet it is one of which
security communities around the world probably will not take much note.
Perhaps, in future historical or theoretical retrospectives of
early-twenty-first-century security praxis his voice will be noted as a
marginal example of both common sense and important insight, but one
that was ignored as hegemonic and elite power performed its tragic,
historical, self-interested, and resilient insensitivity towards the
phenomena of direct and structural violence. As Burke notes towards the
end of his essay, [power often prefers nationalism, imperialism, racism,
or neoliberalism in order to inculcate its version of progress together
with material accumulation]{.underline} (Burke 2013, 25). [Increasing
war, conflict, and political violence are being replaced with structural
war, which is hybrid in strategy and designed to maintain 'naturalised'
and structural, comparative inequalities in the lives of peoples across
the world, often whilst simultaneously speaking of progress. In
modernity, power prefers this version of progress]{.underline} to
pluralism, equity, and justice [across time and space.]{.underline} This
underlying preference of power is, of course, contrary to the obvious
historical evidence about the dangers and weaknesses of such oppressive
strategies, which are simultaneously the target of many forms of
resistance. Burke's article joins a long tradition in European political
thought aimed at reining in power, making it accountable and answerable
to the needs of society, inducing cooperation and highlighting
relationality. It points to historical processes, and their impact on
modern networks of agency, identity, and norms, as well as a subaltern
understanding from below about what social and local claims for security
(and indeed politics) might be. Burke has drawn together a range of
critical perspectives and reapplied them to security in an attempt to
restructure its ontological foundations (Burke 2013, 14) in order to
move towards a new understanding of cosmopolitan security. He argues
that [this evolution does not represent a new security utopia (or what I
term securitopia). It balances the architecture of security with the
subjects of security, placing the already secured in league with the
unsecured subaltern.]{.underline} [His approach attempts also to accept
the agonism that goes with the impossibility of fully reconciling
security preferences (Burke 2013, 19) and explains what this means for
cosmopolitan thought concerned with universal norms, or alternatively,
for global solidarity.]{.underline} [He also builds a longer-term
perspective of some considerable complexity, including future
generations, and a multidimensional awareness far beyond the standard
two-dimensional political analysis often connected with binary-code
versions of security in the mainstream securitised, territorialised,
nationalistic yet globalised, policy environment. Burke's approach also
acknowledges the certainty of unintended and unknowable consequences
(Burke 2013, 23). Yet, I still suspect that his argument reproduces
another securitopia because the already secure (ontologically and/or
epistemologically) have such an enormous head start over the insecure
subaltern]{.underline}. Much of what [Burke]{.underline} offers [draws
on]{.underline} and refreshes [a 1990s era understanding of Critical
Security theories, updated in view of new understandings about mobility,
networks, technology, environmental issues, and the capillary
circulation, rather than immobility and capture of power.]{.underline}
His attempt to bring together (whilst taming) post-structuralist
insights with post-English School debates on critical security uses the
common critical theory gambit of retaining a long-standing liberal
international expectation that universality and globality are necessary
(though perhaps 'thin') and may yet offer ethical and epistemological
perspectives (Burke 2013, 14) about a deeper understanding of universal
security capable of incorporating subaltern claims. However, this is
despite much evidence throughout history that concepts of universality
tend to follow hegemony rather than the subaltern, merely to knock off
its rough edges and domesticate it. His argument of course retains a
strong hint of the other critical internationalist mode of thought --
Marxist structural accounts of power and its impact on the social, taken
up by many critical and post-structural theorists. Thus, he touches upon
the contradiction between any universal understandings of security and
the social implications of insecurity, which any subaltern rendering of
security immediately lay bare. What he argues bears repetition as an
example of the potential for incremental development in our
understanding of the relationship between security and emancipation.
Emancipation might be understood in Balibarian terms. More or less, [it
may start from a subaltern positionality in order to represent and
balance rights, material equality, environmental sustainability,
identity, culture, norms, through social and transversal consensus, law,
institutions, the state, regional and international institutions. It may
be described as 'equa-liberty']{.underline} (Balibar 2014), [and is
significant especially where contemporary radical thought has become
increasingly wary of even discursively offering suggestions for deep,
structural reform]{.underline} (Burke 2013, 14). [There are hints of
such thinking throughout his argument (such as with the questions of
normative principles, future cohabitation, and difference) (Burke 2013,
17), but they seem to remain in submission to cosmopolitan versions of
power, emancipation, and subjectivity (which can be seen as
liberal-vanguardist version of liberty).]{.underline} [Though
cosmopolitan thought often conjures up an image of global
polycentricity, and confederal forms of global governance, in practice
it is often centred on the historical emergence of Western power, the
relationship between liberal subjects, legitimate governance at state
and international levels, and global capital: it is grounded in a shaky
liberal international order, in other words]{.underline}. As Mazower's
recent work on the historical evolution of international institutions
implies, cosmopolitanism points to an anti-Copernican, post-Cold War
dynamics in which ethical politics are centred on the west, and spiral
out into the rest of the world as it emerges from colonialism and
communism. [This makes the brute force upon which the
postcolonial/post--Cold War, and now neoliberal world, has emerged
appear to be ethically plausible]{.underline} (Mazower 2012). [Does
security cosmopolitanism perform the same function, hiding the dark side
of securitopia's continuing 'use of slaves'? Regardless of the problem
of whether ontology is freely reshaped, is polycentric, or dispersed,
hegemonic power across the ages has done its best to ignore arguments
about the equal weight of humans, and implications for their material,
abstract, and identity rights. Similarly, it ignores the scale of
solidarity across political communities, about the de-centring of power,
and about the superiority of the underlying ethical systems that might
make such a milieu possible]{.underline}. Yet, who could not agree with
such ethics, apart from the most ardent of liberals, the most
conservative of realists, or the most brutal authoritarian moderniser?
Even so, concessions have been slow in coming throughout history, and
grudging when they arrive. [Power -- even a variant of liberal power --
justifies its reluctance to concede on the grounds of divine right
translated in modern stratification, leadership, economy, and management
based upon epistemic superiority, and ultimately as the guardians of the
security of the less capable. It has been well documented
that]{.underline} [power legitimates itself by maintaining blind spots
about the unintended consequences of its approaches. Direct and
structural violence tend to naturalise themselves through governance,
militarism, social organisation, and capital, hiding away in their
opaque corners. We are confronted with increasing empirical evidence
that power adopts security perspectives that prettifies and preserves
its structures and privileges, regardless of their rhetoric of the
'liberal peace' or of noting scientific, evidence bases, normative and
ethical, or social and anthropological concerns. Security and capital
have together become the modern basis for the preservation of unfair
privilege simultaneous to their other functions of safety and wealth
distribution. They provide the modern basis for the many exceptions to
equality under norms of democracy and human rights. Reform in the
security structure of the state and the international system cuts to the
heart of existing and historic power structures, their allocation of
resources, their biases, and objectives. They will not dismantle
themselves, but they claim to incorporate 'the evidence' and 'best
practice' into their ongoing practices. Thus, resistance to power and
flatter forms of political]{.underline} (as well as bureaucratic,
professional, and social) [organisation will always be seen as a
security problem, rather than constituent of increasing
security]{.underline} (Burke 2013, 21) according to power holders,
however they justify their position (and being relatively more secure
than their subjects). [Note how, after a lengthy valourisation of
globalisation and its benefits for human freedom, it is now being termed
a danger for security in many such quarters, and globalisation itself is
becoming a venue for the strengthening of the 'security communities'
which patrol the existing world order.]{.underline} [Security itself is
constituted by power relations, definitions of normality and estimations
of priorities and objectives across the full range of human activity,
with the loudest voices maintaining the discourse and the structure.
Even where freedom and liberty is the goal, the growth of security is
ontologically predicated on a growing awareness of insecurity for an
existing or ideal order and concurrent hierarchy intent on balancing
present with future, and power with norms.]{.underline} [Insecurity is
ever expanding, refined, mixed with ideals (often for others) and
embedded into the existing political order in order to maintain its
'progressive', interventionary power structures and the exceptions that
enable its vanguardism.]{.underline} It is a very complex, perhaps
impossible task to logically reconcile these different elements in a
world that is at least socially intent on making its own democratic
futures. Yet the alternative is to merely submit to fate as determined
solely by power.

### AT: Reps Not First -- War 

#### Framing issue -- the way we discuss and represent war should come first -- the language surrounding violence has direct, concrete effects 

**Collins & Glover '02** (John, Assistant Prof. of Global Studies at St.
Lawrence University, Ross, Visiting Professor of Sociology at St.
Lawrence University, Collateral Language, p. 6-7)

As any university student knows, theories about the "social
con­struction" and social effects of language have become a common
feature of academic scholarship. [Conservative critics often argue that
those who use]{.underline} these [theories of language]{.underline}
(e.g., deconstruc­tion) [are "just" talking about language, as opposed
to]{.underline} talking about [the "real world."]{.underline} The essays
in this book, by contrast, begin from the premise that [language matters
in the most concrete, im­mediate way possible: its use, by political and
military leaders, leads directly to violence in the form of
war]{.underline}, mass murder (in­cluding genocide), the physical
destruction of human commu­nities, and the devastation of the natural
environment. Indeed, [if the world ever witnesses]{.underline} a
[nuclear holocaust, it will probably be because leaders]{.underline} in
more than one country have [succeeded in convincing their people,
through the use of political language, that the use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} and, if necessary, the destruction of the earth
itself, [is justifiable]{.underline}. From our perspective, then, [every
act of political violence]{.underline}---from the horrors perpetrated
against Native Americans to the murder of political dissidents in the
So­viet Union to the destruction of the World Trade Center, and now the
bombing of Afghanistan---[is intimately linked with the use of
language.]{.underline} Partly what [we are talking about]{.underline}
here, of course, are the [processes of "manufacturing consent" and
shaping people's per­ception of the world around them]{.underline};
people are more likely to sup­port acts of violence committed in their
name if the recipients of the violence have been defined as
"terrorists," or if the violence is presented as a defense of "freedom."
Media analysts such as Noam Chomsky have written eloquently about the
corrosive ef­fects that this kind of process has on the political culture
of sup­posedly democratic societies. At the risk of stating the obvious,
however, the most fundamental effects of violence are those that are
visited upon the objects of violence; [the language that shapes public
opinion is the same language that burns villages, besieges entire
populations, kills and maims human bodies, and leaves the ground scarred
with bomb craters and littered with land mines.]{.underline} As George
Orwell so famously illustrated in his work, [acts of vio­lence can easily
be made more palatable through the use of eu­phemisms such as
"pacification"]{.underline} or, to use an example discussed in this
book, "targets." It is important to point out, however, that [the need
for such language derives from the simple fact that the violence itself
is abhorrent. Were it not for the]{.underline} abstract language of
"vital interests" and "surgical strikes" and the [flattering lan­guage
of]{.underline} "civilization" and ['just" wars, we would be less likely
to avert our mental gaze from the physical effects of
violence.]{.underline}

### AT: Security possible

#### Security is self-negating

**Calkivik 10** (Emine Asli Calkivik, PhD in political science from the
University of Minnesota, October 2010, "Dismantling Security,"
<https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/99479/Calkivik_umn_0130E_11576.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>,
modified)

Before elaborating further the notion of processual structure of time by
visiting Marx and Foucault's critical theory of modernity, I want to
take a brief pause to reflect upon what such reflections on political
temporality reveal in relation to the faith based investment in security
that I touched upon in the opening lines of this section. Formulating
the contradictory nature of security slightly differently than Spitzer's
analysis of this faith, I want to articulate it along temporal terms.
[Security is]{.underline} contradictory, as Spitzer suggests; and I
would add that it is [an im-possible goal]{.underline}.250 While
interlinked, this im-possibility can be analytically disaggregated into
two senses. On the one hand, [security is im-possible because discourses
of security are constructed through discourses of danger and
safety]{.underline};251 [politics of security puts to work a
power/knowledge nexus that designates which lives are livable and which
ones are to be ended with impunity]{.underline}.252 [Security thus
emanates from an economy of violence, a dialectics of security and
insecurity, which can never be resolved in the final instance. Hence,
its im-possibility, or, as described by some scholars, its aporetic
nature]{.underline}.253

Yet, security is also im-possible in another sense, which speaks
directly to the temporal structure of politics of security. As a goal,
[security constitutes an infinitely deferred promise precisely because
it is a goal that can never be attained: security is im-possible because
there is no way to ultimately ascertain that we are finally
secure---thereby redeemed]{.underline}. It is this impossibility of
final redemption that gives security its own perverse logic. [Security
takes its own limit---its own im-possibility--- as its driving force,
turning it into its condition of possibility]{.underline}. It enacts a
temporal structure characterized by a diachrony of an eternally deferred
end. Hence, the politics of security is a politics construed
as---quoting Nancy---"an endless, ~~autistic~~ process."254

## 2AC Framework

### 2AC FW -- Policy 

**Debate over international policy is [necessary]{.underline} to solve
[global crises]{.underline} and provides an essential counterweight to
government propaganda that enables a reckless foreign policy**

**Walt '11** (Stephen, Profess of IR at Harvard, International Affairs
and the Public Sphere,
publicsphere.ssrc.org/walt-international-affairs-and-the-public-sphere/)

[There is today no shortage of global problems that social scientists
should study in depth: ethnic and religious conflict within and between
states, the challenge of economic development, terrorism, the management
of a fragile world economy, climate change and other forms of
environmental degradation, the origins and impact of great power
rivalries, the spread of weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}, just
to mention a few. In this complex and contentious world, one might think
that academic expertise about global affairs would be a highly valued
commodity. Scholars would strive to produce useful knowledge, students
would flock to courses that helped them understand the world in which
they will live and work, and policymakers and the broader public would
be eager to hear what academic experts had to say. One might also expect
scholars of international relations to play a prominent role in public
debates about foreign policy, along with government officials, business
interests, representatives of special interest groups, and other
concerned citizens. Social scientists are far from omniscient, but the
rigor of the scientific process and the core values of academia should
give university-based scholars an especially valuable role within the
broader public discourse on world affairs. At its best, academic
scholarship privileges creativity, validity, accuracy, and rigor and
places little explicit value on political expediency. The norms and
procedures of the academic profession make it less likely that scholarly
work will be tailored to fit pre-conceived political agendas. When this
does occur, the self-correcting nature of academic research makes it
more likely that politically motivated biases or other sources of error
will be exposed. Although we know that scholarly communities do not
always live up to this ideal picture, the existence of these basic norms
gives the academic world some important advantages over think tanks,
media pundits, and other knowledge-producing institutions. Yet the
precise role that academic scholars of international affairs should play
is not easy to specify. Indeed, there appear to be two conflicting ways
of thinking about this matter. On the one hand, there is a widespread
sense that academic research on global affairs is of declining practical
value, either as a guide to policymakers or as part of broader public
discourse about world affairs. Former policymakers complain that
academic writing is "either irrelevant or inaccessible to policy-makers.
. . locked within the circle of esoteric scholarly discussion." This
tendency helps explain Alexander George's recollection that
policymakers' eyes "would glaze as soon as I used the word theory."\[1\]
As Lawrence Mead noted in 2010: "Today's political scientists often
address very narrow questions and they are often preoccupied with method
and past literature. Scholars are focusing more on themselves, less on
the real world. . . . Research questions are getting smaller and
data-gathering is contracting. Inquiry is becoming obscurantist and
ingrown."\[2\] Within the field of international affairs, this trend has
led to repeated calls to "bridge the gap" between the ivory tower and
the policy community.\[3\] Consistent with that aim, a number of
prominent scholars have recently organized workshops or research
projects seeking to challenge this "cult of irrelevance" and deprogram
its adherents, although it is not clear whether these efforts will
succeed in reversing the current drift.\[4\] This online symposium
reflects a similar concern: how can the academic world contribute to a
healthy public conversation about our collective fate, one that leads to
more effective or just solutions to contemporary problems and helps
humankind avoid major policy disasters? On the other hand, closer
engagement with the policy world and more explicit efforts at public
outreach are not without their own pitfalls. Scholars who enter
government service or participate in policy debates may believe that
they are "speaking truth to power," but they run the risk of being
corrupted or co-opted in subtle and not-so-subtle ways by the same
individuals and institutions that they initially hoped to sway. Powerful
interests are all-too-willing to use the prestige associated with
academic scholars to advance particular policy goals, and scholars are
hardly immune to temptations that may cloud their judgment or compromise
their objectivity. Furthermore, scholars who embrace the role of a
"public intellectual" may be tempted to sensationalize their findings to
attract a larger audience or find themselves opining on topics on which
they have no particular expertise. Instead of improving the quality of
public discourse, such behavior may actually degrade it. The remainder
of this essay explores these themes in greater detail. I begin by
discussing the unique contributions that academic scholars could make to
public discourse on world affairs---at least in theory---highlighting
their capacity to serve as an authoritative source of knowledge about
the world and as an independent voice in debates about contemporary
issues (→Why Is Academic Scholarship Valuable?). I then consider why
there is a growing gap between university-based scholars and both the
policy world and the public sphere, and suggest that this trend is due
largely to the professionalization of academic disciplines and the
concomitant rise of a quasi-academic community of think tanks with
explicit political agendas (→Why Is There a Gap between Academia and the
Public Sphere?). Next, I identify some of the pitfalls that scholars
face when they become more active participants in the public sphere
(→The Pitfalls of Engagement). I conclude by proposing several reforms
that could help the social sciences make a more vital contribution to
public understanding and policy formation in the broad domain of global
affairs (→What Is To Be Done?). Why Is Academic Scholarship Valuable?
Academics can make at least three distinct contributions to public
discourse on global affairs. First, although the digital revolution has
made a wealth of information from around the world accessible on a near
real-time basis, most of us still lack both extensive direct data on
events in far-flung areas and the background knowledge necessary to
understand what new developments mean. If our town's school district is
troubled or the local economy is suffering, we can observe that for
ourselves and make reasonably well-informed judgments about what might
be done about it. But if the issue is the war in Afghanistan, an
uprising in Yemen, a naval confrontation in the South China Sea or the
prospects that some battered economy will be bailed out successfully,
most of us will lack the factual knowledge or conceptual understanding
to know what is really going on. Even when basic information is readily
available, it may be hard for most of us to put it in the appropriate
context or make sense of what it means. When citizens and leaders seek
to grasp the dizzying complexity of modern world politics, therefore,
they must inevitably rely upon the knowledge and insights of specialists
in military affairs, global trade and finance, diplomatic/international
historians, area experts, and many others. And that means relying at
least in part on academic scholars who have devoted their careers to
mastering various aspects of world affairs and whose professional
stature has been established through the usual procedures of academic
evaluation (e.g., peer review, confidential assessments by senior
scholars, the give-and-take of scholarly debate, etc.). Second, and more
importantly, [an independent academic community is an essential
counterweight to official efforts to shape public understanding of key
foreign policy issues. Governments enjoy enormous information
asymmetries in many areas of political life, but these advantages are
especially pronounced when dealing with international
affairs.]{.underline} Much of what we know about the outside world is
ultimately derived from government sources (especially when dealing with
national security affairs), and public officials often go to
considerable lengths to shape how that information is reported to the
public. Not only do governments collect vast amounts of information
about the outside world, but they routinely use secrecy laws to control
public access to this information. Government officials can shape public
beliefs by leaking information strategically, or by co-opting
sympathetic journalists whose professional success depends in part on
maintaining access to key officials.\[6\][Given these information
asymmetries and their obvious interest in retaining public support for
their preferred policies, it is hardly surprising that]{.underline} both
democratic and non-democratic [leaders use their privileged access to
information to build support for specific policies, at times by telling
outright lies to their own citizens]{.underline}.\[7\] This situation
creates few problems when the policies being sold make good strategic
sense, but [the results can be disastrous]{.underline} when they don't.
In such cases, **[alternative voices are needed to challenge
conventional wisdoms and official rationales, and to suggest different
solutions]{.underline}** to the problem(s) at hand. Because
[scholars]{.underline} are protected by tenure and cherish the principle
of academic freedom, and because they are not directly dependent on
government support for their livelihoods, they [are **uniquely
positioned to challenge prevailing narratives and policy rationales and
to bring their knowledge and training to bear on vital policy
issues**]{.underline}. If we believe that unfettered [**debate helps
expose errors and correct missteps, thereby fostering more effective
public policies**,]{.underline} then [a sophisticated, diverse and
engaged scholarly community is essential to a healthy
polity.]{.underline} Third, the scholarly world also offers a
potentially valuable model of constructive political disagreement.
Political discourse in many countries (and especially the United States)
has become increasingly personal and ad hominem, with little attention
paid to facts and logic; a trend reinforced by an increasingly
competitive and loosely regulated media environment. Within academia, by
contrast, even intense disputes are supposed to be conducted in
accordance with established canons of logic and evidence. Ad hominem
attacks and other forms of character assassination have no place in
scholarly discourse and are more likely to discredit those who employ
them than those who are attacked. By bringing the norms of academic
discourse into the public sphere, academic scholars could help restore
some of the civility that has been lost in recent years. For all of
these reasons, [it is highly desirable for]{.underline} university-based
[scholars to play a significant role in public discourse about **key
real-world issues**]{.underline} and to engage directly with
policymakers where appropriate. As I have argued elsewhere, [academic
research can]{.underline} provide policymakers with relevant factual
knowledge, provide typologies and frameworks that [help policymakers and
citizens make sense of emerging trends, and create and test theories
that leaders can use to choose among different policy
instruments.]{.underline} [Academic theories can]{.underline} also be
useful when they [help policymakers anticipate events]{.underline}, when
they [identify recurring tendencies or obstacles to success,
and]{.underline} when they [facilitate the formulation of policy
alternatives and the identification of benchmarks that can guide policy
evaluation. Because academic scholars are free from daily responsibility
for managing public affairs, they are in an ideal position to develop
new concepts and theories to help us understand a complex and changing
world.]{.underline}

### 2AC Pragmatism Good 

#### Taking action to solve problems is good.

**Kratochwil** '**08** (Friedrich, professor of international relations
-- European University Institute "The Puzzles of Politics," pg. 200-213)

The lesson seems clear. [Even at the danger of "fuzzy boundaries", when
we deal with "practice]{.underline}" ( just as with the "pragmatic
turn"), [we would be well advised to rely on the use of the term rather
than on its reference]{.underline} (pointing to some property of the
object under study), [in order to draw the bounds of sense and
understand the meaning of the concept. My argument for the fruitful
character of a pragmatic approach in IR,]{.underline} therefore, [does
not depend on a comprehensive mapping of the varieties of research in
this area, nor on an arbitrary appropriation or exegesis of any specific
and self-absorbed theoretical orientation]{.underline}. For this reason,
in what follows, I will not provide a rigidly specified definition, nor
will I refer exclusively to some prepackaged theoretical approach.
Instead, [I will sketch out the reasons for which a pragmatic
orientation in social analysis seems to hold particular
promise]{.underline}. These reasons pertain both to the more general
area of knowledge appropriate for praxis and to the more specific types
of investigation in the field. The follow- ing ten points are -- without
a claim to completeness -- intended to engender some critical reflection
on both areas. Firstly, [a pragmatic approach does not begin with
objects]{.underline} [or "things" (ontology), or with reason and method
(epistemology),]{.underline} [but with "acting]{.underline}" (prattein),
[thereby preventing some false starts]{.underline}. Since, [**as
historical beings placed in a** specific situations**, we do not have
the luxury** of deferring decisions **until we have** found the "truth",
**we have to act and must do so always under time pressures and in the
face of incomplete information.**]{.underline} Pre- cisely [because the
social world is characterised by strategic interactions, what a
situation "is", is hardly ever clear ex ante, because it is being
"produced" by the actors and their interactions]{.underline}, [and the
multiple possibilities]{.underline} are rife with incentives for
(dis)information. [This puts a premium on]{.underline} quick
[diagnostic]{.underline} and cognitive [shortcuts informing
actors]{.underline} about the relevant features of the situ- ation, and
on leaving an alternative open ("plan B") in case of unexpected
difficulties. [Instead of]{.underline} relying on [certainty and
universal validity gained through abstraction]{.underline} and
controlled experiments, [we know that completeness and attentiveness to
detail]{.underline}, rather than to generality, [matter]{.underline}. To
that extent, likening practical choices to simple "discoveries" of an
already independently existing "reality" which discloses itself to an
"observer" -- or relying on optimal strategies -- is somewhat heroic.
These points have been made vividly by "realists" such as Clausewitz in
his controversy with von Bülow, in which he criticised the latter's
obsession with a strategic "science" (Paret et al. 1986). While
Clausewitz has become an icon for realists, only a few of them (usually
dubbed "old" realists) have taken seriously his warnings against the
misplaced belief in the reliability and use- fulness of a "scientific"
study of strategy. Instead, most of them, especially "neorealists" of
various stripes, have embraced the "theory"-building based on the
epistemological project as the via regia to the creation of knowledge. A
pragmatist orientation would most certainly not endorse such a position.
Secondly, [since acting in the social world often involves acting "for"
someone, special responsibilities arise that aggravate both the
incompleteness of knowledge as well as its generality
problem]{.underline}. Since we owe special care to those entrusted to
us, for example, as teachers, doctors or lawyers, [we cannot just rely
on what is generally true, but have to pay special attention to the
particular case]{.underline}. Aside from avoiding the foreclosure of
options, [we cannot refuse to act on the basis of incomplete information
or insufficient know- ledge]{.underline}, and the necessary diagnostic
will involve typification and comparison, reasoning by analogy rather
than generalization or deduction. Leaving out the particularities of a
case, be it a legal or medical one, in a mistaken effort to become
"scientific" would be a fatal flaw. Moreover, [**there still remains the
crucial element of "timing" --** of knowing when to act. Students of
crises have always pointed out the importance of this factor but, in
attempts at building a general "theory" of international politics
analogously to the natural sci- ences, such elements are neglected on
the basis of the "continuity of nature" and the "large number"
assumptions]{.underline}. Besides, "timing" seems to be quite
recalcitrant to analytical treatment.

### 2AC Fiat Good 

**The aff's role experimentation is a useful heuristic for engaging with
the world and jumpstarts larger political change**

**Connolly '13** (William, Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of Political
Science @ Johns Hopkins, *The Fragility of Things*, 2013, pg. 181-189)

We begin by noting a dilemma haunting electoral politics in several
countries. (1) [It is tempting for critics to forgo electoral politics
because it is so dysfunctional. But to do so cedes too much independent
power to corporate action and the radical right]{.underline} [with
respect to state power]{.underline}. [The right loves to make politics
dysfunctional to make people lose confidence in it and to transfer their
confidence to the private sector]{.underline}. (2) Yet the logic of the
media-electoral-corporate system does spawn a confined grid of electoral
intelligibility that makes it difficult to think, experiment, and act
outside its parameters. Think of the market initiating/state veto power
of corporations, of media talking heads concentrating on differences
between candidates, of the primacy of electoral strategists, of focus
groups, of the role of scandal in the media and electoral politics, of
the strategic location in elections of inattentive "undecided voters,"
of billionaire super PACs, and so on. [The electoral grid cannot be
ignored or ceded to the right]{.underline}, [but it also sucks
experimental pursuits and bold ventures out of politics. How can we
renegotiate this dilemma]{.underline} of electoral politics? That is the
problematic within which I am working. [I do not purport to have a
perfect response to it. Perfect answers are suspect. It may be wise to
start with the positive possibilities of micro-experimentation on
several fronts. One thing that connects individuals, constituencies, and
institutions is the roles that constitute an institutional
matrix.]{.underline} The word connection is actually too weak. [We are
partly constituted by the array of roles we perform, and those
performances resonate with the larger institutions in which they are
set]{.underline}. You are, say, a teacher, an athlete, a lover, a
parent, a middle-aged child of an aging parent, a student, a worker, a
voter, a churchgoer, a film addict, a citizen, a consumer, a member of a
political party, an investor, a blogger, a musician, an artist, and so
on endlessly. You are, in part, a composite of the roles in which you
participate, even though you overflow that composite. Subcategories, of
course, multiply within each abstract category. A "worker" may repair
computers, cook hamburgers, serve tables, advise clients on investments,
sell furniture, teach elementary school kids, give Sunday sermons, be a
TV producer, be a film director, and so on. As a devotee, you may be an
evangelical Christian, a Catholic, a reform Jew, an orthodox Jew, a
Unitarian, a devotee of nontheistic reverence, a Muslim, a Hindu, or a
follower of the kind of Buddhism that eschews a personal God. The degree
of intensity within each of these modes of identification will also
vary. Many role performances are tacit, as when you follow accepted
rules of eye contact on an urban street, stop automatically at a red
light on the way to work, chew your food a set number of times before
swallowing, unconsciously participate in a settled practice of
consumption, watch and listen quietly to a film at the theater, glance
at an attractive gym partner through the mirror rather than staring
directly, close the door when you are in the bathroom, adopt a
distinctive stride during casual walks, or never pick your nose in
public. To break that last restraint would be disgusting, reminding us
how tacit role performances are infused with affective judgments. Such
practices have become habitual, often in ways that condense previous
relations of overt power. Other role performances are more clearly laden
with degrees of power, as when you obey an order from a boss, pay your
taxes on time, arrive at work punctually, bow your head during prayer to
minimize family tensions, avoid eye contact with a cop, give your
earnings to the pimp who oppresses you, obey the terms of your
probation, buy a car because no other mode of transportation is
available, conform to the pace of work on an assembly line, or conceal
drugs from prison officials. Erving Goffman is brilliant at disclosing
the tacit character of many shared role performances, as Judith Butler
is in thinking about how they help to constitute a culture of gender
practices. Here is one statement from Goffman, as he collects examples
from multiple sources, exposing a series of tacit role performances that
define and secure the modern sense of bodily integrity: How very
intimate the bodily sense is can be seen by performing a little
experiment in your imagination. Think first of swallowing the saliva in
your mouth, or do so. Then imagine expectorating it into a tumbler and
drinking it! What seemed natural and "mine" suddenly becomes disgusting
and alien. Or picture yourself sucking blood from a prick in your
finger; then imagine sucking blood from a bandage around your finger!
What I perceive as separate from my body becomes, in the twinkling of an
eye, cold and foreign. 2 "In the twinkling of an eye." Butler, in Gender
Trouble, focuses on how experimental performances bring out tacit
practices that constitute the dominant experience of gender. Here is
what she says in an early book about the ambiguity of drag: "In
imitating gender, drag implicitly reveals the imitative structure of
gender itself---as well as its contingency. Indeed, part of the
pleasure, the giddiness of the performance is in the recognition of a
radical contingency in the relation between sex and gender in the face
of cultural configurations of causal unities that are regularly assumed
to be natural and necessary...; we see sex and gender denaturalized by
means of a performance." It is of course debatable how far such
denaturalization proceeds, and drag does not guarantee, as Butler knows,
which responses will be made to its strategy of denaturalization. But
denaturalizing performances do open the door to new possibilities of
enactment, as they disclose inner, nuanced relations between cultural
performance and gender constitution. As another quote from Butler in a
later edition of the same book reveals, the culturally infused sense of
bodily integrity and disgust in Goffman\'s example carries implications
for the unconscious norms of sexual experience historically built into
this culture: "Those sexual practices in both heterosexual and
homosexual contexts that open surfaces and orifices to erotic
signification or close down others effectively reinscribe the boundaries
of the body along new cultural lines. Anal sex among them." 3 To
reinscribe the cultural play of disgust and pleasure with respect to
bodily fluids and orifices is to participate in the micropolitics of
gender and sexual practice. As these two thinkers reveal, [there are
significant relays between role performance, self-identity, and the
formation of larger political constellations.]{.underline} Not in the
sense that minor shifts in a series of role performances could by itself
transform an entire political regime but in the sense that large-scale
cultural investments in a set of role expectations tend to express and
support the priorities of an established regime, while large-scale [role
experimentations]{.underline} [can both make a difference on their own
and help to set preconditions for constituency participation in more
robust political movements.]{.underline} The domains of gender and
sexuality are important on their own, and recent success in these
domains carries suggestions of how to act in others as well. The
creative politics of gender and sexuality during the past forty years
displays how potent the play back and forth can be among role
experimentations, occupational practices, local assemblies, teaching
routines, church struggles, state policies, judicial decisions, and
legislative enactments. Here I focus on protean connections between role
experimentation, self-identity, economic performance, and macropolitical
actions. To condense the flow chart, an institution is an organized
hierarchy of roles in relation to energies and activities that overflow
them, such as gossip, backdoor deals, confusion, whistle-blowing, care,
revenge, and secrecy; roles mediate between identities and institutions;
there is often a degree of slack within institutions as to how a role is
to be performed; an accumulation of role experimentations in several
venues can make a direct difference in politics; role experimentations
by some can also set examples for others; and such experiments can
filter into the sensibilities, beliefs, identities, and larger political
activities of those who initiate and respond to them. 4 A series of
shifts on this register, for instance, may dispose you to listen
attentively to new proposals for large-scale political action. Powerful
subterranean currents thus flow back and forth between role performance,
existential orientation, belief, and larger political actions. Indeed as
such oscillations proceed, moments of stuttering, unfocused shame,
laughter, and hesitation periodically arise, drawn from the element of
noise that inhabits the spaces between roles and role bearers. There is
no zone of complete neutrality in a world of role performances. Obedient
performances in cumulative effect tend to support the existing regime as
they insinuate its dictates into our collective habits of perception,
judgment, and action. Unless a dissident group of workers meticulously
"works according to rule" to disrupt production through excruciating
obedience in a way that discloses how tangled formal rules can become.
Or a group creatively improvises on the performance of Bartleby the
Scrivener, posing endless questions about the orders given to it until
the machine overflows itself or is jammed. These indeed are creative
role experimentations. So was the practice in Eastern Europe during the
late stages of Soviet rule to clap endlessly when a Soviet stooge spoke,
until the bewildered speaker was moved to sit down amid the roar around
him. I recently attended a faculty meeting with the president of my
university at which the entire faculty remained silent after his
CEOstyle talk ended and he departed slowly up the aisle. Sometimes
silence sends a message to power. Our lives are messages. 5 [Role
experimentation can disrupt and redirect the flow of authority, habit,
institutional regularity, and future projection.]{.underline} It can
also encourage others to look more closely at their own performances in
this or that domain. [Such experiments can]{.underline} also [set the
stage for more adventurous and larger scale actions.]{.underline} My
examples will be limited to constituencies who are the most apt to read
this book, though they could easily be adjusted to a broader array.
Suppose a constellation of students, studying to enter professional
life, forms study groups to explore more closely how those professions
presuppose and enforce a set of practices that contribute to the
fragility of things as they simultaneously draw attention away from that
contribution. The students may pose untimely questions in their
political science, economics, engineering, medical, business, legal, and
biology classes. If in a secular institution, they may seek out courses
that complicate the assumptions of secularism. If in a religious school,
they may organize a group to explore the history of atheism or of
minority faiths that eschew the theme of a personal God. They can engage
experimental artistic work that stretches their habitual patterns of
perception and judgment. The nature- and soundscape compositions of John
Luther Adams have salutary effects on many in this respect. [Such
activities can]{.underline} also [prime you to experiment]{.underline}
[with other role performances once you enter professional life. If a
lawyer, you may organize to rethink your connections to the]{.underline}
ugly [prison system and to adjust your practice to protest its
ugliness.]{.underline} Or you may give a portion of your time to
challenge corporations, localities, and states that defile the
environment. If a doctor, you may organize voluntary medical care for
the poor and publicize what you are doing. In both cases these
[experimentations make a modest difference on their own, prime our
capacities for more sensitive perception in other domains of life, and
may prepare us to participate with others in yet more adventurous
activities]{.underline}. These are minor moments, but an accumulation of
minor moments can jostle settled habits of perception; they can
encourage a readiness to become more exploratory; and they can extend
the time horizon within which we think and act. Suppose, now, you are
middle- or upper-middle-class citizens in a polity that has competitive
elections. You have become increasingly dissatisfied with the course
your society is taking. Voting, while pertinent, seems radically
insufficient to the issues involved. Its time horizon is too short and
the strategic place of ill-informed undecided voters in electoral
politics skews campaigns too sharply. Inequality has been extended. The
lower reaches of society are left out in the cold and often blamed for
the suffering they undergo. The news media are organized around scandal
and a brief time horizon. Racial differences are exploited to break up
potential coalitions on the left. A large slice of the population is
periodically susceptible to war fever. Climate change is widely
subjected to deferral, denial, or formal acceptance disconnected from
action. And the right wing actively promotes filibusters and legislative
stalemates to encourage more and more people to withdraw from
citizenship and to tolerate the privatization of more and more of life.
The sciences and professions with which you are familiar are often too
narrowly defined. Too many churches either provide refuges from the
world or serve as sites of aggressive attack on ecological concerns,
homosexuality, carriers of alternative faiths, or poor minorities. You
know what political party you support; you vote regularly; and you give
time and money to your party. But you also find it difficult to connect
the sentiments you profess to the role expectations sedimented into your
practices of work, church, consumption, neighborhood association,
investment portfolio, children\'s school, artistic pursuits, and local
news reporting. Now is the time to join others in becoming role

series of minor role experiments As we proceed our aspirational selves
may now begin to exceed our operational selves, and the shame we feel
about the discrepancy between these two aspects of the self may generate
energy to enter into yet new modes of role experimentation. 6 We thus
begin to make ourselves and our engagements more experimental rather
than simply falling into a ready-made set of role expectations. We have
begun to become what Nietzsche calls "our own guinea pigs" rather than
merely being the guinea pigs of those in charge of these institutions.
[As such experiments accumulate, the ice in and around us begins to
crack]{.underline}. First, the shaky perceptions, feelings, and beliefs
with which we started these experimentations now become more refined and
more entrenched. Second, [we are now better situated to forge
connections with yet larger constituencies engaging in similar
experiments]{.underline}. Third, [as these connections accumulate we may
be more inspired to join macropolitical movements that speak to the
issues.]{.underline} Fourth, as we now join protests, slowdowns, and
confrontational meetings with corporate managers, church leaders, union
officials, university officials, and neighborhood leaders, we may now
become more alert to the institutional pressures that propel these
constituencies forward too. They are also both enmeshed in a web of
roles that enable and constrain them and often more than mere role
bearers. These roles too exhibit varying degrees of pressure and slack
as they link the details of daily conduct to the strategic practices of
the larger political economy. [One advantage of role experimentation by
several constituencies at multiple sites is that it speaks to a time in
which the drive to significant change must today be mobilized by a
large, pluralist assemblage rather than by a single class]{.underline}
or other core constituency. [Such an assemblage must be primed and
loaded by several constituencies at many sites. Role experimentations
and the shape of a pluralist assemblage thus inflect one
another.]{.underline} We must condense some of the steps involved. But
[perhaps]{.underline} the multidimensional [pluralist
assemblage]{.underline} in which you have now begun to participate
[approaches a tipping point]{.underline}---[crystallized, say, by
movement back and forth between role experiments, shifts in the
priorities of some strategic institutions, and a change in the contours
of electoral politics.]{.underline} Now [a surprising event may occur,
allowing these emergent energies to be crystallized. At this point some
will enter the scene to say that no kind of "reformism," no matter how
extensive, is acceptable.]{.underline} We must wait for a bigger, more
total transformation, they will say. [Such an account will be
offered]{.underline} at precisely this tipping point [as the only
sophisticated reading of the world. But it is not. Yes, roles,
institutions]{.underline}, events, constitutive acts, [and larger
structures are interinvolved, with each enabling and limiting
others.]{.underline} Yes, we do inhabit a world of multiple
entanglements and interconnections. [Yes, the primacy of capitalist
markets]{.underline} and private ownership does [give]{.underline}
owners and high-rolling [investors key advantages in setting the agenda
of the state.]{.underline} [Yes, states subject to public elections
are]{.underline} also [limited by systemic relations to corporate
structures]{.underline} and the threat of capital strikes. Yes, extreme
inequality, combined with legislative and court decisions inspired by
neoliberal ideology, do disenfranchise many as they release billions of
dollars to right-wing electoral campaigns. Yes, private ownership of the
media does give great advantages to the corporate establishment. Yes,
dependent workers do face uphill battles in limiting capital through
labor organization. [Yes, the limited reach of semisovereign states in
the global economy exerts corporate pressure on them]{.underline}, just
as, inside the United States at least, the right-wing Supreme Court\'s
devolution of authority to states in a federal system forces states to
compete with each other for corporate favors. Yes, elected
representatives are dependent on campaign money and their desires to
find jobs as lobbyists after they leave office. Yes, there are pressures
on many in the lower middle class to identify with the vision of the
future publicized by those above them. [It may therefore appear that
there are no cracks and fissures in these interconnected processes. It
may seem that you must either embrace the system with fervor, withdraw
as much as possible from it, or wait for an explosion that changes
everything rapidly.]{.underline} [The hegemony of neoliberal ideology
reinforces such a reading of the alternatives]{.underline}, in its way,
even as it otherwise emphasizes our inability to have a bird\'s-eye view
of the system. It offers a bird\'s-eye view of the whole whenever it
insists that market self-organization means impersonal market
rationality. But repeated experience belies such an equation. There are
numerous examples of surprising economic meltdowns, often ushered into
being by submission to that very ideology. And [periodically critical
movements emerge, as if from nowhere, to challenge existing priorities
at vulnerable sites. There is,]{.underline} for starters, [the surprise
of the Arab Spring]{.underline}, with its ambivalent possibilities; [the
emergence of a New Left in Euro-American countries in the 1960s and
1970s; the birth of feminist and gay rights movements]{.underline} in
those same countries that have probed soft spots in churches, the media,
corporate benefit packages, universities, state policy, and families;
there is the "slut walk" by which young women challenged the idea that
how they dress determines whether they deserve sexual assault; [there is
Tiananmen Square, which revealed currents of energy and protest in China
that are still festering;]{.underline} [there is the Occupy movement,
springing as if from nowhere, to galvanize previously isolated pockets
of dissatisfaction]{.underline} and unrest; [there is the civil rights
movement, which has reenergized itself several times; there are several
ecological movements]{.underline}, mobilizing diffuse dissatisfactions
with the direction neoliberal regimes have taken. [Each of these events
and movements exposes soft spots, cracks, uneven edges, and leakages in
"the system," through which new lines of creative activity can form and
pass.]{.underline}

### 2AC AT Affect 1^st^

#### **Affect studies cannot translate into political change** 

**Martin '13** (Emily, Professor in the Department of Anthropology at
New York University, "The Potentiality of Ethnography and the Limits of
Affect Theory," Current Anthropology: Vol. 54, No. S7)

Many [scholars in the humanities have]{.underline} recently [engaged
with research in neuroscience]{.underline} [to posit a view of
a]{.underline} [precognitive, preindividual stage of human perception
that promises unrealized dimensions of potentiality]{.underline}. Here
are some descriptions of affect in the words of two theorists from quite
different disciplines. Nigel Thrift, a geographer, writes, In this paper
I want to think about affect in cities and about affective cities ...
and, above all, about what the political consequences of thinking more
explicitly about these topics might be---once it is accepted that the
political decision is itself produced by a series of inhuman or
pre-subjective forces and intensities. (Thrift 2004:58) Eric Shouse, a
cultural critic, states, An [affect is a non-conscious experience of
intensity]{.underline}; it is a moment of unformed and unstructured
potential. ... Affect is always prior to and/or outside of
consciousness. (Shouse 2005) There are a number of importantly different
varieties of affect theory. Some are indebted to Silvan Tomkins's (2008)
writing and others to Francisco Varela's work on open systems, often in
the style of Deleuze and Guatarri (1987; Varela 1999). But taking into
account their differences, historian Ruth Leys (2011) summarizes some of
the main assumptions they hold in common: "For the theorists in
question, affects are 'inhuman,' 'pre-subjective,' 'visceral' forces and
intensities that influence our thinking and judgments but are separate
from these. Whatever else may be meant by the terms affect and emotion
... the affects must be non-cognitive, corporeal processes or states"
(437).7 For such theorists, affect is, as Brian Massumi (2002) asserts,
"irreducibly bodily and autonomic" (28). Other enthusiastic contributors
to affect theory from a wide range of fields, include Eve Sedgwick,
Patricia Clough, Lauren Berlant, Elizabeth Grosz, Rosie Braidotti,
Kathleen Stewart, Lawrence Grossberg, Elizabeth Wilson, and Antonio
Damasio.8 This work relates directly to the theme of potentiality.
Massumi, one of the most widely read writers on affect theory, stresses
its connection with "potential" in a chapter called "Autonomy of
Affect." Something that happens too quickly to have happened, actually,
is virtual. The body is as immediately virtual as it is actual. The
virtual, the pressing crowd of incipiencies and tendencies, is a realm
of potential. In potential is where futurity combines, unmediated, with
pastness, where outsides are infolded and sadness is happy (happy
because the press to action and expression is life). (Massumi
2002:30--31; italics in original) The definition Massumi gives to the
concept of potential here seems to be "unlimited." In particular, the
affective realm is not limited by what he sees as the constraints of
sociolinguistic meaning. [What motivates these scholars?]{.underline}
They do not all agree on every point, and I will be glossing over their
differences here, but Leys identifies some common motivations.
Centrally, [they claim that the role of reason and rationality in
politics]{.underline}, ethics, and aesthetics [has been
overvalued]{.underline}. It is too disembodied and "unlayered" an
account of the way people actually form opinions (Leys 2011:436). Given
this, [they adopt the position that humans are corporeal creatures with
important subliminal affective intensities and resonances that are
decisive in the way we form opinions and beliefs]{.underline}. They
share an insistence that we ignore affects at our peril because they can
be manipulated deliberately and because they contain the potential for
creativity and transformation. In sum, [the affects are independent of
and before language]{.underline}. They are before "intentions, meanings,
reasons, and beliefs"; they are "non-signifying, autonomic processes
that take place below the level of conscious awareness and meaning";
they are "'inhuman,' 'pre-subjective,' 'visceral' forces that influence
our thinking and judgments" even though they are noncognitive and
corporeal (Leys 2011:437, 443). Among the affects, at the physiological
level, categories that are cognitively separate (such as sad or
pleasant) get connected, and this is one way the affects are thought to
open up new and creative potential (Massumi 2002:29).
Massumi---following Deleuze---considers that the affects are
characterized by "intensity" rather than content. Affective states,
characterized by intensity, are nonsemantic, nonlinear, autonomous,
vital, singular, indeterminate, and disruptive of fixed (conventional)
meanings. Hence the affects provide a rich reservoir of unpredictable
potentiality. All this means there is a gap between the signifying order
(content, meaning, convention) and the affective order. What exactly is
the gap? According to Leys (2011), there is "a constitutive disjunction
between our emotions on the one hand and our knowledge of what causes
and maintains them on the other, because ... affect and cognition are
two separate systems" (437). These theorists generally argue that affect
is independent of meaning and signification; they deny the role of
intentionality and meaning at the affective level (Leys 2011:450).
[There is a gap or "radical dichotomy between the 'real' causes of
affect and the individual's own interpretation of these
causes"]{.underline} (Tomkins, quoted in Leys 2011:437). In Tomkins's
view, affects are "phylogenetically old, automatic responses of the
organism that have evolved for survival purposes and lack the cognitive
characteristics of the higher-order mental processes and are separate
from them" (Leys 2011:437). The affects are located subcortically in the
brain, in the part of the brain that processes universal, natural kinds
(such as the so-called basic emotions). The "basic emotions" or "[affect
programs" are genetically hardwired responses]{.underline}, products of
human evolution, that are [expressed in autonomic behavioral
patterns]{.underline} (such as characteristic facial expressions for
fear or disgust) (Damasio 1994; Leys 2011:438--439; Sedgwick 2003).
There is one part of affect theory that relates directly to the theme of
potentiality. This is the supposition that there is no way to include
both mind and body in an account of meaning, making it necessary to
posit a level below the gap where bodily aspects of affect go on; it is
the unformed, precognitive aspects of the lower level of the affects
that make them seem filled with potential. This move separates
intentionality or meaning from affect and assumes that intentionality
and meaning are purely mental or cognitive. [There are many points at
which this argument can be criticized]{.underline}.9 Some [critics have
shown in detail how the psychological evidence]{.underline} [that is the
basis for the tenets of affect theory is questionable and out of
date]{.underline} (Leys 2010). Others have detailed the ways [affect
theorists]{.underline} sometimes [misread biological and psychological
research]{.underline} (Papoulias and Callard 2010). For example, in a
1985 experiment by Benjamin Libet, subjects were asked to decide to flex
a finger at will and to note the exact time they made the decision. The
experimenters also measured the exact time of any rise in the subject's
brain activity and the exact time of the subject's finger flexing. The
results showed that there was a 0.2-second delay between the brain's
activity spike and the subject's decision, then a 0.3-second delay
between the subject's decision and his finger flexing. In all, there
seemed to be a half-second delay between the subject's brain's initial
activity and the subject's finger actually flexing (Libet 1985). This
half-second gap provides Massumi (2002:29) with the [evidence of a gap
between]{.underline} ([lower) brain activity and (higher)
decision]{.underline}, [intentionality and action]{.underline}. He
concludes that material processes of the brain generate our thoughts;
conscious thoughts, decisions, and intentions come too late to be very
significant. [At most]{.underline} they [are reflections after the
fact.]{.underline} [No one would doubt that the brain is necessary for
thought and action.]{.underline} But Massumi and other affect theorists
place too much weight on this experimental evidence. Other studies have
shown that Libet's evidence is open to contrary interpretations from its
publication in 1985 up until the present (Banks and Isham 2009, 2010;
Gomes 1998). At the very least, before drawing such far-reaching
conclusions, one would hope scholars of cultural phenomena would
consider the experimental structures that generate psychological data.
As I noted earlier, the psychological subject becomes a particular kind
of stripped down entity, a data-emitting being whose subjective
experience is outside the frame of the experiment. Perhaps this is not
the most adequate model for understanding human intentionality. [The
mistakes and confusions in this position are laid bare by the approach
pioneered in the Cambridge Expedition and later pursued in
Wittgenstein's account of intention, remembering, and other
psychological terms.]{.underline} That account argues that our criteria
for whether they have happened are normative and conventional. These
[criteria are located in use, not in the interior psyche.]{.underline}
Saying that criteria for meaning are normative and conventional does not
mean that everyone must agree, that there is harmony, or that there is
not conflict or change. It means that criteria for meaning cannot arise
from the mind of a single, isolated individual or from a primitive part
of the brain. Drawing on Wittgenstein, Elizabeth Anscombe argued for a
social account of intentional actions. Anscombe was arguing against the
common-sense view of an intention as composed of an action plus an
interior mental state. Looking at the ways we speak of an action as done
"intentionally," she concluded that "intention" in everyday language
means something done as an action of a whole person, a moral agent,
"under a description." The relevant description would include the past
and present social contexts relevant to the person as much as his or her
interior states (Anscombe 1957). [What is at stake is whether we
understand intentional human action as gaining its meaning in an
interior, hidden, and thus socially inaccessible space instead of in the
light of social experience.]{.underline} Anscombe worked in a
Wittgensteinian mode to move intentionality away from the private
interiority of the mind into the space of social interaction, where
meaning in language is constituted. Wittgenstein conveyed this message
through many homely examples: [I tell someone: "I'm going to whistle you
the theme ..." It is my intention to whistle it, and I already know what
I am going to whistle. It is my intention to whistle this theme: have I
then already, in some sense, whistled it in thought?]{.underline}
(Wittgenstein 1967:2e) One would like to ask: "Would someone who could
look into your mind have been able to see that you meant to say that?"
Suppose I had written my intention down on a slip of paper, then someone
else could have read it there. And can I imagine that he might in some
way have found it out more surely than that? Certainly not.
(Wittgenstein 1967:8e; italics in original) The point is that
intentionality emerges from the whole structure of events from the
inception of the notion to the execution of the action. [We decide
whether someone had a certain intention not by referring to an event or
template in the mind but by whether]{.underline} his or her [gestures,
postures, words, and actions fit with a socially defined notion of being
about to whistle a tune or meaning to say something]{.underline}.
[Sometimes a mental event]{.underline} (whistling the tune or saying the
words in one's head) [might precede the action and sometimes
not,]{.underline} [but in any case,]{.underline} [that interior event
could not constitute a usable criterion for whether someone was
intending to whistle or meaning to speak. Removing any interest in
intentionality]{.underline}---conceived as a social process, as affect
theory does---[removes socially produced contexts of use as a necessary
and sufficient basis for what actions and words mean to
people.]{.underline} Tackling mathematics, the realm of symbolic life
perhaps most difficult to regard as contingent on social norms,
Wittgenstein commented that people found the idea that numbers rested on
conventional social understandings "unbearable" (Rhees 1970). [Why is
there resistance to allowing the meaning of human acts to rest on social
understandings]{.underline} all the way down? Why such an idea is
unbearable returns us to the Cambridge Expedition. Rivers and the others
thought that plunging into a different social and physical environment
would make them different people, comparable in many ways to the
islanders. In this view there is a vast reservoir of potential for
change and creative adaption. But this view also entails that there are
limits to human experience set by whatever social contexts are relevant.
It does not compare with Massumi's (2002) virtual realm, the "pressing
crowd of incipiencies and tendencies" (30). Perhaps it is any limitation
that seems unbearable in the present era, where the drumbeat of the
necessity for constant growth is heard and felt everywhere. Saying that
social context limits what is relevant does not close off experiences
that are unconscious, inchoate, or unspeakable. Anthropologists and
sociolinguists have long found ways to address the entirely social
meanings of things that are repressed from speech or action but
nonetheless contain powerful kinds of potentiality. Years ago Gayle
Rubin (1975) analyzed the "sex/gender system" as a "set of arrangements
by which a society transforms biological sexuality into products of
human activity" (159). More recently, in Brainstorm, Jordan-Young (2010)
rephrases this: "Gender ... is a social effect, rather than the result
of human biology. Sex in this regard is conceived as the remainder---the
material body, and those bodily interactions that are necessary to
reproduce it" (13). Borrowing from this way of putting it, we could say
that like the sex/gender system, [the affect/intentionality system is a
set of arrangements by which a society transforms neurological processes
into products of human activity]{.underline}. [Affects are a social
effect rather than the result of human biology]{.underline}. [Intentions
in this regard are conceived as the remainder]{.underline}---[the
material brain and those neurological interactions that are necessary to
reproduce it.]{.underline}

in cloistered isolation are not likely to produce great insights,
especially when the social problems besetting us today are of such
magnitude. All knowledge must be disciplined. That is, knowledge must be
shared by and with others if it is to count as knowledge. Positivists
and post-positivists are each working hard to improve and clarify the
standards of knowledge within their respective paradigms. This is an
important turn for both, as it will facilitate progress within each even
as it raises barriers to exchange across approaches. So, if not a
thousand flowers, it is perhaps better for teams of scholars to tend a
small number of separate gardens, grow what they can best, and share
when possible with the others and, especially, the broader societies of

## 2AC AT Links

### 2AC AT War=Structure 

#### Their theory of global war is [oversimplified]{.underline} -- it's a result of a lack of strategic objectives 

**Chandler** **'09** (David, Professor of International Relations at the
Department of Politics and International Relations, University of
Westminster "War Without End(s): Grounding the Discourse of 'Global
War'," Security Dialogue, Vol. 40(3): 243--262) Rethinking Global War)

Western governments appear to portray some of the distinctive
characteristics that Schmitt attributed to 'motorized partisans', in
that the shift from narrowly strategic concepts of security to more
abstract concerns reflects the fact that Western states have tended to
fight free-floating and non-strategic wars of aggression without real
enemies at the same time as professing to have the highest values and
the absolute enmity that accompanies these. [The government policy
documents and]{.underline} critical [frameworks of 'global war' have
been so accepted]{.underline} that [it is assumed that it is the
strategic interests of Western actors that lie behind the often
irrational policy responses]{.underline}, with 'global war' thereby
being understood as merely the extension of instrumental struggles for
control. [This perspective seems unable to contemplate the possibility
that it is the lack of a strategic desire for control **that** drives
and defines 'global' war today.]{.underline}

[Very few studies]{.underline} of the 'war on terror' **[start from a
study of the Western actors themselves]{.underline}** [rather than from
their declarations of intent]{.underline} with regard to the
international sphere itself. [This methodological framing inevitably
makes assumptions about strategic interactions]{.underline} [and
grounded interests of domestic or international regulation]{.underline}
and control, [which are then revealed to explain the proliferation of
enemies]{.underline} [and the **abstract and metaphysical discourse** of
the 'war on terror']{.underline} (Chandler, 2009a). For its radical
critics, the abstract, [global discourse merely reveals the global
intent of the hegemonizing designs]{.underline} of biopower or
neoliberal empire, as critiques of liberal projections of power are
'scaled up' from the international to the global.

[Radical critics working within a broadly Foucauldian problematic have
no problem grounding global war in the needs of neoliberal]{.underline}
or biopolitical [governance]{.underline} or US hegemonic designs. These
critics have produced numerous frameworks, which seek to assert that
global war is somehow inevitable, based on their view of the needs of
late capitalism, late modernity, neoliberalism or biopolitical
frameworks of rule or domination. From the declarations of global war
and practices of military intervention, rationality, instrumentality and
strategic interests are read in a variety of ways (Chandler, 2007).
[Global war is taken very much on its own terms]{.underline}, [with the
declarations of Western governments explaining and giving power to
radical abstract theories]{.underline} of the global power and
regulatory might of the new global order of domination, hegemony or
empire.

[The alternative reading of 'global war' rendered here seeks to clarify
that the declarations of global war]{.underline} **[are a sign of the
lack of political stakes and strategic structuring]{.underline}** of the
international sphere **[rather than frameworks for asserting global
domination.]{.underline}** We increasingly see Western diplomatic and
military interventions presented as justified on the basis of
value-based declarations, rather than in traditional terms of
interest-based outcomes. [This was as apparent in the wars of
humanitarian intervention in Bosnia, Somalia and Kosovo]{.underline} --
[where there was **no clarity of objectives**]{.underline} **[and
therefore little possibility of strategic planning]{.underline}** in
terms of the military intervention or the post-conflict political
outcomes -- as it is in the 'war on terror' campaigns, still ongoing, in
Afghanistan and Iraq. [There would appear to be a direct relationship
between the lack of strategic clarity]{.underline} **[shaping and
structuring interventions and the lack of political stakes involved in
their outcome]{.underline}**. In fact, the globalization of security
discourses seems to reflect the lack of political stakes rather than the
urgency of the security threat or of the intervention. Since the end of
the Cold War, [the central problematic could well be grasped as one of
withdrawal and the **emptying of contestation**]{.underline} from the
international sphere **[rather than as intervention and the contestation
for control.]{.underline}** The disengagement of the USA and Russia from
sub-Saharan Africa and the Balkans forms the backdrop to the policy
debates about sharing responsibility for stability and the management of
failed or failing states (see, for example, Deng et al., 1996). It is
the lack of political stakes in the international sphere that has meant
that the latter has become more open to ad hoc and arbitrary
interventions as states and international institutions use the lack of
strategic imperatives to construct their own meaning through
intervention. As Zaki Laïdi (1998: 95) explains:

war is not waged necessarily to achieve predefined objectives, and it is
in waging war that the motivation needed to continue it is found. In
these cases -- of which there are very many -- war is no longer a
continuation of politics by other means, as in Clausewitz's classic
model -- but sometimes the initial expression of forms of activity or
organization in search of meaning. . . . War becomes not the ultimate
means to achieve an objective, but the most 'efficient' way of finding
one.

[The lack of political stakes in the international sphere would appear
to be the precondition for the globalization of security
discourses]{.underline} **[and the ad hoc and often arbitrary decisions
to go to 'war'.]{.underline}** In this sense, [global wars reflect the
fact that the international sphere has been reduced to little more than
a vanity mirror for globalized actors who are freed from strategic
necessities]{.underline} and whose concerns are no longer structured in
the form of political struggles against 'real enemies'. The mainstream
critical approaches to global wars, with their heavy reliance on
recycling the work of Foucault, Schmitt and Agamben, appear to invert
this reality, portraying the use of military firepower and the implosion
of international law as a product of the high stakes involved in global
struggle, rather than the lack of clear contestation involving the
strategic accommodation of diverse powers and interests.

Conclusion

[International law evolved on the basis of the ever-present possibility
of real war between real enemies.]{.underline} [Today's global wars of
humanitarian intervention and the 'war on terror' appear to be bypassing
or dismantling this framework of international order.]{.underline} Taken
out of historical context, today's period might seem to be analogous to
that of the imperial and colonial wars of the last century, which evaded
or undermined frameworks of international law, which sought to treat the
enemy as a justus hostis -- a legitimate opponent to be treated with
reciprocal relations of equality. [Such analogies have enabled critical
theorists to read the present through past frameworks of strategic
political contestation, **explaining the lack of respect for
international law and seemingly arbitrary and ad hoc use of military
force on the basis of the high political stakes involved.**]{.underline}
Agamben's argument that classical international law has dissipated into
a 'permanent state of exception', suggesting that we are witnessing a
global war machine -- constructing the world in the image of the camp
and reducing its enemies to bare life to be annihilated at will --
appears to be given force by Guantánamo Bay, extraordinary rendition and
Abu Ghraib.

[Yet, once we go beyond the level of declarations of policy values and
security stakes]{.underline}, [the practices of Western militarism **fit
uneasily** with the policy discourses]{.underline} and suggest a
different dynamic: [one where the lack of political stakes in the
international sphere means that there is little connection between
military intervention and strategic planning. I]{.underline}n fact, as
Laïdi suggests, [it would be more useful to understand the projection of
violence as a search for **meaning and strategy**]{.underline} rather
than as an instrumental outcome. To take one leading example of the
'unlimited' nature of liberal global war: the treatment of terrorist
suspects held at Guantánamo Bay, in legal suspension as 'illegal
combatants' and denied Geneva Red Cross conventions and prisoner-of-war
status. The 'criminalization' of the captives in Guantánamo Bay is not a
case of reducing their status to criminals but the development of an
exceptional legal category. In fact, far from criminalizing
fundamentalist terrorists, the USA has politically glorified them,
talking up their political importance. It would appear that the
designation of 'illegal combatants' could be understood as an ad hoc and
arbitrary response to the lack of a clear strategic framework and 'real
enemy'. In this context, the concept of criminalization needs to be
reconsidered. Guantánamo Bay can be seen instead as an attempt to create
an enemy of special status. In fact, with reference to Agamben's thesis,
it would be better to understand the legal status of the 'illegal
combatants' as sacralizing them rather than reducing them to the status
of 'bare life'. In acting in an exceptional way, the USA attempted to
create a more coherent and potent image of the vaguely defined security
threat.

This approach is very different, for example, from the framework of
criminalization used by the British government in the fight against
Irish republicanism, where the withdrawal of prisoner-of-war status from
republican prisoners was intended to delegitimize their struggle and was
a strategic act of war. Ironically, whereas the criminalization of the
republican struggle was an attempt to dehumanize the republicans -- to
justify unequal treatment of combatants -- the criminalization of global
terrorists has served to humanize them in the sense of giving coherence,
shape and meaning to a set of individuals with no clear internally
generated sense of connection. Far from 'denying the enemy the very
quality of being human', it would appear that the much-publicized abuses
of the 'war on terror' stem from the Western inability to cohere a clear
view of who the enemy are or of how they should be treated.

[The policy frameworks of global war attempt to make sense of the
implosion of the framework of international]{.underline} order [at the
same time as articulating the desire to recreate a framework of meaning
through policy activity.]{.underline} [However, these projections of
Western power]{.underline}, even when expressed in coercive and
militarized forms, [**appear to have little connection to strategic or
instrumental projects of hegemony.** The concept of
'control']{.underline}, articulated by authors such as Carl Schmitt and
Faisal Devji, [seems to be key to understanding the transition from
strategic frameworks]{.underline} of conflict to today's unlimited (i.e.
arbitrary) expressions of violence. Wars fought for control, with a
socially grounded telluric character, are limited by the needs of
instrumental rationality[: the goals shape the means
deployed.]{.underline} Today's Western wars are fought in a
nonstrategic, non-instrumental framework, which lacks a clear
relationship between means and ends and can therefore easily acquire a
destabilizing and irrational character. [**To mistake the** arbitrary
**and** unlimited **nature of violence and coercion** without a clear
strategic framework **for a heightened desire for control** fails to
contextualize **conflict in the social relations of
today**]{.underline}.

### 2AC AT Global Local 

#### Don't just focus on the US -- forming transnational linkages is key

**Gassama '99** (Ibrahim, JD, Associate Professor, University of Oregon
School of Law, "TRANSNATIONAL CRITICAL RACE SCHOLARSHIP: TRANSCENDING
ETHNIC AND NATIONAL CHAUVINISM IN THE ERA OF GLOBALIZATION," Michigan
Journal of Race & Law, Vol. 5:133)

Today, [as we are reminded time and again, the United States is the
world\'s sole remaining superpower with a superheated economy that is
the envy of the rest of the world.]{.underline} Yet, with less than five
percent of the world\'s population, [the United States unapologetically
consumes far more than a proportionate share of the world\'s
resources]{.underline}. \'9 [The American economy]{.underline}, largely
dependent on an apparently irrepressible demand for cheaply made foreign
consumer goods, [propels along as the twentieth century comes to an end
even as most of the rest of the world]{.underline}-Europe, Japan, China,
Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America\--[struggles]{.underline} to
stay afloat.2 American economic supremacy is not new and neither are
some of the governmental policies and practices that proceed along with
it: pitifully small amounts of economic assistance to the world\'s poor,
an unbridled military-industial complex that leads the world in the
export of arms, and a propensity to employ military force against
foreigners 22 who challenge its dominance.

[There are,]{.underline} of course, [domestic parallels to all these
examples of fundamental injustices]{.underline} [and these]{.underline},
perhaps understandably, [dominate the thinking of most American
activists and scholars]{.underline} engaged in antisubordination work.
Nonetheless, [it appears from my particular vantage point]{.underline}23
[that significant within every oppressed community in the United States
is a perspective that could be summarized as follows: if the United
States is going to be the world\'s principal enforcer of]{.underline} a
global regime of [inequality]{.underline}, [our members should at least
get equal opportunity to participate]{.underline} in this imperial
enterprise whether it is to command military forces in Iraq or Korea;
**[to run C.I.A. stations in Paris or Kuala Lumpur]{.underline}**; to
negotiate drilling rights in Ogoniland or Baku; to deny visas to
\"economic immigrants\" in Bangkok or Freetown; or to win scholarships
endowed by some dead imperialists. This is what I observe as the many
\"firsts\" that are celebrated and we dutifully keep count of the
numbers of representatives of this or that excluded community recruited
into higher levels in the machinery of global supremacy. The fights over
which disadvantaged groups get seats at the imperial dinner table, or
get to taste some of the dribblings from it, usually occur without much
heed paid to the broader transnational picture.

[The relative absence of a transnational or global perspective in the
unfolding of many of these \"domestic\" struggles for justice is the
focus]{.underline} [of my comment]{.underline} on Eric Yamamoto\'s work.
[This absence is rarely challenged.]{.underline} Indeed, [the attitude
of neglect is so pervasive, it often operates
unacknowledged]{.underline}.24 [It is testimony to the enormous strength
of the myth of American national exceptionalism]{.underline} that even
those acutely and historically oppressed by its operation adopt its
precepts uncritically, and actually nurture it in their struggles. [At
its core are the twin notions of fundamental faith, both in the
integrity and sufficiency of the \"American\" nation and in the
mythology of social progress]{.underline}. Great care is taken among
mainstream activists not to destabilize the nation, or appear to do so,
even at the expense of social justice.

### 2AC China Threat Real

#### The link is non-unique: the U.S. and China have already adopted the worst form of security thinking -- the only option is clear, actionable policy recommendations -- DA to the alternative, and the best scholarship proves our aff is true 

**Goldstein '15** (Lyle associate professor and founding director, China
Maritime Studies Institute, U.S. Naval War College, *Meeting China
Halfway*, pg. 1-4 May 2015)

As US-China rivalry continues to build a dangerous momentum in our own
time, it will be important for those interested in the future of this
crucial relationship to somberly reflect on the roughly 35,000 Americans
killed in the Korean War--- the first and only major US-China
conflagration. 2 They may also consider that in the fall of 1950, "no
one in the Pentagon, the State Department, or the White House took
\[Chinese warnings\] any more seriously than MacArthur did." 3 Today,
similar warnings are worryingly common in Chinese discourse on strategic
affairs. 4 The Cold War and related ideological struggles are now long
past, of course, but [the potential for a US-China military conflict has
increased markedly in the past ten years]{.underline} and now
encompasses scenarios ranging from the South China Sea, to the East
China Sea, back to the Korean Peninsula, and even into the Indian Ocean
and much further afield. In comparing the present era of geopolitical
rivalry with the early Cold War, however, one difference is most
prominent. In 1950 the United States was at the apex of its strength,
and China had been gravely weakened by decades of war and internal
turmoil. [Today the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [confronts
a China that is vastly strengthened]{.underline}. [The concomitant
risks]{.underline}, therefore, [are that much greater]{.underline}.
Indeed, given the strength of both powers, a [military conflict today
between China and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could
resemble]{.underline} not so much the "limited" Korean War but the even
graver tragedy of [World War]{.underline} I, which has been the subject
of so much discussion during its recent centenary.

[Scholars who research US-China relations]{.underline} on both sides of
the Pacific [are nearly universal]{.underline} in concluding [that such
a catastrophic conflict today is far from inevitable]{.underline}. [But
what they have not done thus far is to provide concrete intellectual
paradigms and accompanying policy proposals to lead this troubled
relationship away from the brink of disaster]{.underline}. Therefore,
this book seeks to be dramatically different from any other in the field
in its treatment of US-China relations, by explicitly focusing on how to
realize new paths to bilateral cooperation via "cooperation spirals"---
the opposite of an escalation spiral. One hundred policy proposals are
made throughout the chapters of this book, not because these are the
only solutions to arresting the alarming course toward conflict, but
rather to inaugurate a genuine debate regarding policy solutions to the
most vexing problems in bilateral relations.

[At present]{.underline}, unfortunately, [the two nations' rivalry
continues to unfold across geopolitical]{.underline}, economic, and even
cultural [realms and is now extant in all corners of the
globe]{.underline}. As China seeks to pursue its "New Silk Road
Strategy" with a raft of new projects and initiatives, American
strategists might do well to reflect on the obvious fact that China's
new "lean to the west," in part at least, seems to reflect a disposition
not to "lean to the east," an alternative that would have meant seeking
to meet the American rebalance directly in East Asia but was ultimately
rejected. [Beijing]{.underline} thus [appears to be intentionally
avoiding a]{.underline} kind of "[head-on]{.underline}"
[collision]{.underline} by focusing China's energies in a different
direction. [However]{.underline}, [strategists with a zero-sum
disposition are all but certain to try to conjure up]{.underline} a
clever series of [strategic countermoves]{.underline} to prevent the
growth of Chinese influence in Central Asia, South Asia, the Middle
East, and beyond. The author has had the unique opportunity to witness
firsthand, in both Washington and Beijing, the [intense fear and
loathing]{.underline} that [drive zero-sum mentalities in both
countries]{.underline} and the [competitive and increasingly dangerous
policies that have resulted]{.underline}. Of course, [the combination of
the]{.underline} "[balance of financial terror]{.underline}" [with
the]{.underline} "[balance of nuclear terror]{.underline}" [thankfully
lends considerable ballast to the relationship]{.underline}. [But it
would be foolhardy in the extreme to rely on these largely hypothetical
shock absorbers to prevent a catastrophe]{.underline}. Moreover, [the
rivalry between the United States and China not only carries the risks
of conventional or]{.underline} even [nuclear warfare but]{.underline},
apart from these most obvious risks, [also bears the immensely costly
burdens of an arms race and proxy conflicts below the threshold of
direct hostilities]{.underline}. [And]{.underline} then [there are the
opportunity costs of this rivalry]{.underline}--- [in crucial
areas]{.underline}, [such as responses to nuclear proliferation or
pandemic outbreaks--- where cooperative opportunities have]{.underline},
far too often, [been crowded out by the tendency toward
rivalry]{.underline}. Of late, [the US-China rivalry has been
eclipsed]{.underline}, at least [in the headlines]{.underline}, [by
tensions in US-Russian relations]{.underline} resulting from the 2014
crisis in Ukraine. [But this trend is not likely to be
durable]{.underline} since [Russia is hardly strong enough to compete
against the West]{.underline} on its own. [The same cannot be said of
China]{.underline}.

Within five years, if it has not already occurred, China's economy will
surpass that of the United States in size. [And China has steadily
improved its military prowess and weapons technology, such that it has
even moved ahead of the US military in certain domains]{.underline}, for
example, [the not insignificant area of antiship cruise
missiles]{.underline}. 5 The ideological factor in the bilateral
relationship, moreover, which pits democratic and market principles
against authoritarian state capitalism, has the frequent effect of
spraying gasoline over already-red-hot coals. A rather typical,
ideologically tinged American analysis of the strategic dilemma posed by
China's rise ends as follows: "Only a fully democratic China would
undoubtedly seek to ... maximize the happiness of the population rather
than \[its\] ... own power." 6 In other words, [the
dilemma]{.underline}, [as understood by many]{.underline} if not most
[Americans]{.underline}, [can be resolved only if China embraces
American values and institutions]{.underline}. [But might there be other
ways to mitigate the two countries' "natural" tendency toward
rivalry]{.underline}, [with its myriad costs and dangers?]{.underline}

A spring 2011 Brookings Institution report by Kenneth Lieberthal and
Wang Jisi marked an important reality check for observers of US-China
relations. Their dismaying conclusion revealed that relations were
plagued with "strategic distrust," despite more than sixty bilateral
dialogues intended to foster greater trust. In explaining the Chinese
perspective on strategic distrust, Wang reports candidly that "some
high-ranking officials have openly stated that the United States is
China's greatest national security threat. This perception is widely
shared in China's defense and security establishments and in the
Communist Party's ideological organizations." Lieberthal likewise offers
a similarly suspicious American perspective: "Americans ... worry ...
that China seeks to displace the United States as Number 1, and
\[Beijing\] views US-China relations in fundamentally zero-sum terms."
This book adopts and seeks to carry forward several recommendations made
in Lieberthal and Wang's path-breaking report, but it also draws
inspiration from their attempt "to spark creative thinking." 7

The June 2013 meeting of presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping at
Sunnylands in Rancho Mirage, California illustrated the top-level
recognition on both sides that the bilateral relationship is evolving in
troubling directions. The concept of the meeting--- that the two leaders
would spend extended "free time," without a formal agenda or large
groups of advisers--- was undoubtedly positive. As one wise commentary
on the Sunnylands summit observed: "It is extraordinary that the leaders
of the world's two great powers meet so rarely in this way," and further
noted that "it is easy to mock the idea of meetings for the sake of
meetings," but quite correctly concluded that personal trust between the
leaders could amply facilitate much-needed diplomatic breakthroughs and
also help mitigate the most severe crises. 8 A breakthrough of sorts
could even be seen in [President Xi's proposed]{.underline} ""
([new-type major power relations]{.underline}). Although many will
undoubtedly criticize the term as frustratingly lacking in specific
frameworks regarding how to proceed, what the term does usefully provide
is a strong recognition that, on one hand, the relationship is of
supreme importance to both powers and indeed to the world. On the other
hand, and perhaps even more important, the term [illustrates the clear
understanding by Beijing of the inherent dangers of unbridled great
power competition]{.underline} and the imperative, therefore, to break
with patterns of past great power rivalries. 9 Since the Sunnylands
summit, a string of positive, albeit small-scale joint activities has
been undertaken by the US and Chinese armed forces. And yet troubling
military confrontations have also continued--- for example, in December
2013, involving warships from the two countries in the South China Sea;
and in August 2014, involving US and Chinese military aircraft over the
East China Sea. Regrettably, US-China relations are still lacking
fundamental stability. A second major Obama-Xi summit occurred in
November 2014 in Beijing. Encouragingly, this meeting seemed to yield
some tangible results in key areas, such as carbon emissions, trade,
easing visa requirements, and military confidence-building. President Xi
said that "a pool begins with many drops of water," while President
Obama remarked that "when the U.S. and China are able to work together
effectively, the whole world benefits."

[Yet the Washington foreign policy establishment greeted the late 2014
summit with ample skepticism]{.underline}. As one representative
commentary published a couple of weeks after the summit reflected, "The
atmospherics were cordial, \[but\] there were no substantive changes ...
\[regarding\] any of the most neuralgic security issues driving
strategic competition in the Asia-Pacific. China committed itself to
nothing specific or binding. It is difficult not to think that China
wants the appearance of peaceful rise, not the reality." In this same
piece from a commentator at a think tank closely aligned with the
current administration, the author states, "We need to think through
China's strengths and vulnerabilities \[and\] determine our best points
of leverage." In the end, the author calls upon the "United States and
its allies and partners ... to think through the full panoply of
countermeasures available to help fashion a concerted strategy for
countering coercion." 10

A similar skepticism seemed to pervade Obama administration thinking in
the lead-up to the November 2014 summit as it was publicly revealed that
"Mr. Xi's push for a 'new type of great power relations' ... has clearly
fallen out of favor with Mr. Obama and his aides." 11 Dismissing this
phrasing altogether could have major negative consequences for this
all-important relationship over the long term. In short, [rejection of
this concept may well imply to Chinese strategists]{.underline} that
only Washington can develop overall concepts to govern the relationship,
or worse: [that Washington is quite comfortable with]{.underline} "[new
type]{.underline}" [great power relations]{.underline}, [even if that
means rivalry and military conflict]{.underline}. [These are the wrong
messages to convey to Beijing]{.underline} and suggest that the
relationship today is very far from set on a firm foundation,
unfortunately. This book takes a different approach with the clear
realization that one of the most basic principles of cooperation is the
ability to listen and try to comprehend the other side's ideas. Where
the vision of "new-type major power relations" is presently lacking in
specifics, this book has the considerable ambition to provide them in a
forthright and succinct manner. [Relying on the evidence and ideas from
a broad array of Chinese and American thinkers]{.underline}, this book
seeks to provide [the intellectual framework]{.underline}, [in the form
of concrete proposals]{.underline}, that [is necessary to put this most
vital of relationships on a solid footing]{.underline} for the
twenty-first century and beyond. As such, the book, which surveys all
major points of tension in the relationship--- from currency practices
to green technology development to the South China Sea issue--- aspires
to serve as a practitioner's guide for a step-by-step strengthening of
US-China relations. [Scholars are frequently reticent about making clear
and specific prescriptions]{.underline}, [preferring to
emphasize]{.underline} positive description and [value-neutral
theorizing in]{.underline} order to answer puzzles in the study of
[i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations. This is often vital
work, but the author's experience in government and around decision
makers reinforces the perception that [what is required more urgently is
the development of specific]{.underline}, [actionable policy
recommendations that are informed by rigorous political science
analysis]{.underline}. In short, there is ample room for a normative
treatment of US-China relations--- that most critical of bilateral
relationships to world order for the current century, and likely the
ones that follow as well.

#### Our knowledge of China is accurate---their authors have flawed information

Rationalist interpretations do not imply that people are omnipotent in
their ability to procure and process information. We know all too well
that people are subject to a variety of cognitive and perceptual errors
(for example, Jervis 1976; Levy 1997; Kahneman and Tversky 2000; Tversky
and Kahneman 1977). This recognition of limits to rationality, however,
hardly warrants general attributions of naiveté , even stupidity, to
government leaders. On the contrary, it seems sensible to start from the
premise that [officials know their counterparts far better than scholars
may wish to acknowledge. Washington, Beijing, and Taipei,]{.underline}
for instance, [invest enormous time, effort, and resources in trying to
gain an accurate understanding of each other. Academics have a hard time
claiming **any special insight** or unique source of wisdom, whether it
is based on mastery of the other side\'s language, intimate familiarity
with its culture, or access to timely and sensitive information with
restricted distribution. If anything, they are usually at a considerable
disadvantage on these scores when compared to diplomats, intelligence
analysts, and even journalists]{.underline} and business people.
[Indeed, academics in fields such as history and political science
typically operate in the realm of common knowledge, outdated
information, and mundane data]{.underline}. This confession in turn
implies that at least for some of us, our individual and collective
forte lies with the analysis of persistent empirical patterns and the
formulation of general models of foreign policy conduct.

**No impact to China containment threat discourse -- bad reps don't
influence policies towards China and our advantage solves the impact**

[Nevertheless, no matter the extent of playing up the \"China military
threat theory\" by the US military, its influence on Sino-US relations
and the development of the international situation is still limited.
From the 1990s to now, the \"China threat theory\" had emerged once
every two to three years. The US rightist forces and the US military are
accustomed to using it as a \"target\" to play up the \"China military
threat theory\" in order to consolidate their sphere of influence and
position in the US political arena. However, the main trend of the
development of Sino-US relations has not been seriously influenced. On
the one hand, in the US political field, besides military intelligence
and rightist groups that publicize the \"China military threat theory,\"
there are many officers and scholars who \"calmly view the
situation]{.underline} across the ocean,\" seriously look at China\'s
development, and call for strengthening contacts between the United
States and China. A noted US think tank, the Rand Corporation, on 19 May
submitted an evaluation report to the US Air Force on \"China\'s Defense
Modernization: Opportunities and Challenges.\" The report holds that the
Pentagon\'s evaluation of China\'s military spending is seriously
\"inflated\" and the practice of playing up \"China military threat
theory\" on purpose should be rectified. On 26 May, US congressional
heavyweight Senator Joe Lieberman of the Democratic Party and Republican
congressman Alexander jointly put forward an \"Act on Cultural Exchange
Between the United States and China in 2005\" and asked the US
Government to appropriate \$1.3 billion from FY2006 to FY2011 for the
promotion of cultural exchanges between the United States and China,
especially for the expansion and strengthening of US education in
Chinese language and a program for exchange students between the two
countries. In order to guarantee the implementation of the exchange
plan, the proposal also suggested establishing the United States-China
Engagement Strategy Council. In introducing the act, Senator Lieberman
said: \"[All misunderstanding between China and the United States can be
solved by engagement between the two countries.\"]{.underline} Even
within the US Government, views toward the \"China military threat
theory\" are different. The \"engagement group,\" headed by the
Department of State and the National Security Council, holds a different
view on the \"China military threat theory,\" and so the US Department
of Defense could not but postpone its publication of the \"annual report
on Chinese military power\" again and again. On the other hand, due to
pragmatic political considerations, the US Government needs to consider
United States-China relations based on the overall interests of the
country. Although the United States has made some achievements in its
global war against terrorism in the current phase, the new round of
terrorist attacks in Britain shows the United States still cannot
extricate itself from the war against terrorism and will need China\'s
support.

### 2AC Cyber Threats Real

#### Cyber threats are real 

**Lin '12** (Herbert, PhD in Physics from MIT, chief scientist at the
Computer Science and Telecommunications Board at the National Research
Council of the National Academies, where he has been study director of
major projects on public policy and information technology. These
studies include a 2007 study on cybersecurity research, a 2009 study on
offensive information warfare, and a 2010 study on cyber deterrence,
"Thoughts on Threat Assessment in Cyberspace" 2012, 8. ISJP 337)

IV\. Discussion and Conclusion

Section I pointed to influences on analysts to draw worst-case
conclusions. The [discussion]{.underline} of Sections II.A and II.B
[suggests that threats in cyberspace are]{.underline} much
[more]{.underline} tenuous, ephemeral, and [uncertain than]{.underline}
those found [in traditional]{.underline} domains of [military
conflict]{.underline}. Thus, the influences pushing towards worst-case
analysis originating from information scarcity apply even more strongly
when cyberspace is the domain in question. Indeed, given the shadowy
nature of cyber-operations, it is not unreasonable to regard them as
actions that compromise knowledge, information, and certainty.

[When inexperienced human beings with little hard information are placed
into unfamiliar situations]{.underline} in a general environment of
tension, [they will]{.underline} often [make worst-case
assessments]{.underline}. In the words of a former senior Justice
Department official involved with critical infrastructure protection,
\"I have seen too many situations where government officials claimed a
high degree of confidence as to the source, intent, and scope of an
attack, and it turned out they were wrong on every aspect of it. That
is, they were often wrong, but never in doubt.\"\"

The above paragraph refers to situations in which [policymakers are
responding to reports of hostile operations against U.S.
interests]{.underline}, such as protection of U.S. critical
infrastructure, often [in an]{.underline} [atmosphere of
crisis]{.underline}. But the reader might consider the possibility that
[such thinking is]{.underline} also [influential in]{.underline}
[conducting threat assessments under non-crisis conditions]{.underline}.
That is, in the absence of hard information, there is little that can be
done analytically to argue against worst-case threat assessments of
intent and, without countervailing pressures, [threat assessments about
adversary intent in cyberspace could be expected to drift towards more
and more dire predictions.]{.underline}

**[None of these comments should be interpreted to mean that the threat
to U.S. interests emanating from cyberspace is not
serious]{.underline}**. Today, [the debate over]{.underline} the
defensive [cybersecurity]{.underline} posture [is between]{.underline}
**[those who think the]{.underline}** present [**situation is dire and
those who think it is very dire**. No analyst argues]{.underline} [that
the gap between the defensive cybersecurity posture of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the threats it faces is
shrinking; the only serious debate is over how fast that gap is
growing.]{.underline}

Against this backdrop, [what should the]{.underline} policy-making
[consumer of threat assessments in cyberspace make of the assessments
they receive?]{.underline} Although a capabilities assessment that pits
adversary weapons that perform perfectly against friendly defenses that
demonstrate only average performance may be misleading as an indicator
of likely outcomes, **[worst-case assessments of adversary intent may in
fact be reflected in reality]{.underline}**. [That is, a \"God\'s eye
view\" of the intent of U.S. adversaries may indeed be as bleak as a
worst-case assessment would portray.]{.underline}

[What should policymakers do in the face of such uncertainty?
Despite]{.underline} very [high degrees of uncertainty about
the]{.underline} scope and nature of the [cyber-threat,]{.underline}
**[policymakers must still act]{.underline}** [and nothing]{.underline}
in this analysis [suggests that uncertainty should paralyze the
decisionmaking process]{.underline}. Threat assessments are undertaken
for many purposes, but one of the mast important is to inform the
preservation or maintenance of some important functionality. [The
presence of an adversary threat]{.underline} by definition [endangers
some U.S. functionality and a worst-case threat assessment reflects a
subjective estimate that the importance of the functionality at risk is
high]{.underline} (i.e., the likelihood of a bad outcome is high and/or
the magnitude of the loss implied by that bad outcome is high).

### 2AC Deterrence Reps Good 

#### Deterrence theory creates a mutual vulnerability and respect that ushers in a paradigm of onto-security -- reduces the structural likelihood of violence

**Lupovici '08** - (Amir, Post-Doctoral Fellow Munk Centre for
International Studies University of Toronto, "Why the Cold War Practices
of Deterrence are Still Prevalent: Physical Security, Ontological
Security and Strategic Discourse"
http://cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2008/Lupovici.pdf)

[Since deterrence can become part of the actors' identity,
it is also involved in the actors' will to achieve ontological
security, securing the actors' identity and routines.]{.underline} As
McSweeney explains, ontological security is "the acquisition of
confidence in the routines of daily life---the essential predictability
of interaction through which we feel confident in knowing what is going
on and that we have the practical skill to go on in this context." These
routines become part of the social structure that enables and constrains
the actors' possibilities (McSweeney, 1999: 50-1, 154-5; Wendt, 1999:
131, 229-30). Thus[, through the emergence of the deterrence norm and
the construction of deterrence identities, the actors create an
intersubjective context and intersubjective understandings that in turn
affect their interests and routines. In this context, deterrence
strategy and deterrence practices are better understood by the actors,
and therefore the continuous avoidance of violence is more easily
achieved.]{.underline} Furthermore, [within such a context of deterrence
relations, rationality is (re)defined, clarifying the appropriate
practices for a rational actor]{.underline}, and this, in turn,
reproduces this context and the actors' identities. 
Therefore, [the internalization of deterrence ideas helps to explain how
actors may create more cooperative practices and break away from the
spiral of hostility that is forced and maintained by the identities that
are attached to the security dilemma]{.underline}, and which lead to
mutual perception of the other as an aggressive enemy. As Wendt for
example suggests,[in situations where states are restrained from using
violence---such as MAD]{.underline} (mutual assured
destruction)---[states not only avoid violence, but "ironically, may be
willing to trust each other enough to take on collective
identity]{.underline}". In such cases if actors believe that others have
no desire to engulf them, then it will be easier to trust them and to
identify with their own needs (Wendt, 1999: 358-9). In this
respect, [the norm of deterrence, the trust that is being built between
the opponents, and the (mutual) constitution of their role identities
may all lead to the creation of long term influences that preserve the
practices of deterrence as well as the avoidance of violence. Since a
basic level of trust is needed to attain ontological
security]{.underline}, 21 [the existence of it may further strengthen
the practices of deterrence and the actors' identities of deterrer and
deterred actors.]{.underline}  In this respect, I argue that for the
reasons mentioned earlier, the practices of [deterrence should be
understood as providing both physical and ontological security, thus
refuting that there is necessarily tension between them.]{.underline}
Exactly for this reason I argue that Rasmussen's (2002: 331-2)
assertion---according to which MAD was about enhancing ontological over
physical security---is only partly correct. Certainly, MAD should be
understood as providing ontological security; but it also allowed for
physical security, since, compared to previous strategies and doctrines,
it was all about decreasing the physical threat of nuclear weapons.
Furthermore[, the ability to increase one dimension of security helped
to enhance the other, since it strengthened the actors' identities and
created more stable expectations of avoiding violence]{.underline}.

[Two hypotheses were tested]{.underline} in this chapter.
[First,]{.underline} [frames represented prominently]{.underline} in the
media [will tend to mobilize]{.underline} public [support **for policies
associated with those frames**]{.underline}. This study indicates that
[the biomedical frame was the]{.underline} pre[dominant]{.underline}
[frame in media reports in the sampled period 2004--2007]{.underline}
(Tables 5.4--5.9 and Figure 5.1-5.3). [The study]{.underline} also
[highlights]{.underline} a [strong correlation between the biomedical
frame and the]{.underline} American [public's worry]{.underline} about
[the disease]{.underline} and their concern about the likelihood that
the disease [would strike the United States]{.underline}. The surveys
were conducted mainly between December 2005 and in 2006 and the
beginning of 2007. Figure 5.1 clearly indicates that between 2005 and
the second quarter of 2007, [the volume of stories that discussed the
impact of avian flu]{.underline} [on the United States and the globe as
a whole increased]{.underline}. In the second quarter of 2007 all
articles dealt with the impact of the disease on the United States. In
February 2005, a news story reported that at the national meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, scientists stated
that they believed it highly likely that a virus that has swept through
chickens and other poultry in Asia would genetically change into a flu
that can be transmitted among people.38 At the same time, Cambodia and
Indonesia reported their first human cases of avian flu, which turned
out to be fatal.39 By November 2005, the WHO\'s official count of human
cases of H5N1 reached 122, with 62 deaths in Vietnam, Thailand,
Indonesia, and Cambodia.40 This was followed by news reports of the
spread of avian flu to countries such as China, the Russian Federation,
Turkey, Italy, and many other countries around the globe. [This was also
a time when the]{.underline} United States [President and Congress
launched]{.underline} several [initiatives]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} Pandemic and All Hazards [Preparedness Act was
adopted]{.underline} by Congress in December 2006. With this law,
Congress mandated for the first time in United States history that the
federal government prepare a National Health Security Strategy [to
guide]{.underline} improvement of the country's public health emergency
[preparedness]{.underline} and response capabilities. The second
hypothesis tested was that [when]{.underline} the biomedical and
economic [frames dominate]{.underline} media [coverage]{.underline},
which is the most common scenario, [people will be more
worried]{.underline} about the disease. [They will be likely to
support]{.underline} potentially inconvenient policies intended to
address the dangers of the disease. The survey reports show high support
for [**vaccine production** and **research** and]{.underline}
willingness on the part of the American public to [undertake
precautionary measures to deal with the disease]{.underline}. **[The
public did not see]{.underline}** the human rights and **[security
frames as relevant]{.underline}**. [The security frame]{.underline} was
more prominent in media stories about bird flu than it was for SARS. It
[did not]{.underline}, however, [show any significant correlation with
worries about bird flu]{.underline}. The human rights frame was not very
prominent in news stories about bird flu. Part of the reason for this is
that the bird flu did not infect humans in the United States**[, and
there were no]{.underline}** major **[issues arising over]{.underline}**
access to antiviral drugs and vaccines or about **[quarantine and
isolation.]{.underline}**

The former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, asserted that [development cannot proceed easily in
societies where military concerns are at or near the centre of life.
Societies whose economic effort is given in substantial part to military
production inevitably diminish the prospects of their people for
development]{.underline}.. .Preparation for war absorbs inordi- nate
resources and impedes the development of social institutions.\'2 Jack
Matlock, a former United States ambassador to Moscow, makes a similar
point in relation to the required weapons spending for new members
joining NATO: \'It\'s extraordinarily unwise for these countries to
shoulder these costs when they must pay the costs of meeting their
social needs.\'3 Webster\'s Dictionary defines militarism as a \'policy
of maintaining a strong military organization in aggressive preparedness
for war\'.4 [Militarism thus includes the disposition to maintain
national power by means of strong military forces projecting menacing
arms potency capable of deterring or compelling enemy
nations]{.underline}. The Secretary-General and the ambassador argue
that [militarism represents a structural choice that accords military
priorities and arms spending a higher priority than meeting basic human
needs]{.underline}. Are these distinguished diplo- mats right? Are there
dire economic consequences to high levels of military spending? And if
so, what are the human rights implications of militarization? The
[negative effects of militarism on society overall are often
dramatically shown through analysis of the policies of repressive
governments in the less- developed world-from Myanmar (Burma) to Iraq to
Syria.]{.underline} These [dictatorial regimes clearly choose militarism
over human rights]{.underline}. In this article, however, I will
undertake a tougher task. My hypothesis is [that there is a global
trade-off between militarism and economic growth which impacts on the
protection of rights]{.underline}. High levels of military spending in
less developed and developed coun- tries prevent all of these from
fulfilling the basic economic and social rights articulated in the
International Bill of Human Rights. A useful beginning may be made by
examining the effect of military spending on the United States, given
its pivotal role in that economy. If significant military expenditures
have a positive impact on the US economy, it will be difficult to argue
that less developed nations should not pursue such policies. This
analysis is particularly important given the publicity in the new media
worldwide about the \'growth\' and \'success\' of the US economy in the
mid-iggos. What is the rela- tionship between military expenditure and
the state of the US economy? The United States spends a significant
amount of its overall national wealth on weapons systems and standing
armies. Current military planning calls for a \'defence\' budget of well
over \$250 billion a year, plus inflation, well into the twenty-first
century, averaging over \$680 million a day.5 Over 42 per cent of the
entire world\'s military expenditures are made by the United States.[The
fed- eral government spends four times as much on the military as on
education, job training, housing, economic development, and
environmental protection combined]{.underline}.6 The US government has
relied on the military budget above all to stimulate the economy.The
Keynesian\'logic\' that military spending can prevent a
recession/depression has not been challenged by any administration since
the Second World War. The economic prosperity of the United States
during that war left a deep impression. In the I930S the country
experienced the Great Depression, with unemployment rates hovering
around 25 per cent. In I944 the unemployment rate dropped to I.2 per
cent.The public\'s willingness to finance a large military establishment
is linked to the perception that these expendi- tures perform a positive
overall economic function in the national economy. With defence spending
consuming one-third of the federal budget, scholars have documented the
effect of such expenditures on the federal budget deficit.7 During the
Reagan years the United States spent \$2 trillion on defence while
cutting taxes. The resulting budget deficit, combined with high interest
rates and large trade deficits, sent the economy spinning. Further,
while the United States in the I99OS devotes around 5-6.5 per cent of
its GNP to defence, its major economic competitors,Japan and Germany,
allocate a smaller proportion (approximately i per cent and 3 per cent
respectively).8 As a result, [the United States consistently has less
capital to invest in civilian industries. Scholars attribute the
relative decline of the US global economic position vis-a-visJapan and
Germany since the I970S to this draining of scarce capital from civilian
industries]{.underline}. It has been estimated that for every i per cent
of GNP devoted to military spending, overall economic growth is reduced
by about o.5 per cent. In the long term, Japan thus grows at a rate
approximately two or three per- centage points faster than the United
States, all other things being equal. Ron Smith, for example, has used
regression analysis to calculate the ratio of investment to gross
national product against the GNP growth rate, unemployment, and military
expenditure as a percentage of GNP. He discovered a powerful correlation
between increases in defence spending and decreases in investment
spending, supporting the argument of a trade-off between defence and
eco- nomic growth.9 There are two key points here: the enormity of the
military budget; and the economic difference between expenditure and
investment.IO Mainstream economic thought has long viewed military
expenditures as an impediment to economic progress because they are
merely outlays for goods and services and not investments.Adam Smith in
The wealth of nations probably said it best: \'The whole army and navy,
are unproductive labourers. They are the servants of the public, and are
maintained by a part of the annual produce of the industry of other
people. Their service, how honourable, how useful, or how necessary
soever, produces nothing for which an equal quantity of service can
afterwards be procured.\'I Military expenditures are designed to meet an
immediate goal. Investments, on the other hand, are designed to increase
future resources. The diversion of significant amounts of national
resources towards non- productive military expenditures results in
long-term decline in productive capacity and efficiency. This has
occurred in the United States. Since the mid-1970s, the US government
has documented the decline in the American standard of living. Despite
current \'growth\' indicators in the national economy, it has in fact
become harder to climb out of poverty in the United States in the last
two decades. The US economy has become less and less hospitable to the
young, the unskilled and the less educated. This lack of equal
opportunity lim- its the viability of liberal rights.\'2 The Census
Bureau, for example, reported that the percentage of full-time workers
with low earnings grew sharply in the I970s, despite the economic
expansion that brought increased prosperity to the affluent. The Bureau
defined low earnings as \$I2,I95 a year, expressed in I990 dollars and
adjusted for inflation. At the end of the I970s, I2.I per cent of all
full-time employees earned below the equivalent of \$I2,I95, which was
then \$6,905. By I990 that figure had risen to i8 per cent.I3 The number
ofAmerican children living in poverty grew by more than i million during
the I980s, and in I989 about I8 per cent of children in the United
States lived in families with incomes below the federal poverty line,
including 39.8 per cent of all black children, 38.8 per cent of American
Indian children, 32.2 per cent of Hispanic children, I7.I per cent of
Asian-American children, and I2.5 per cent of white children. I4 These
trends are continuing. For example, the Census Bureau reported in I994
that the typical American household saw its income decline in I993, and
more than a million Americans fell into poverty in that year. In I994,
Labor Secretary Robert Reich declared,\'America is in danger of
splitting into a two- tiered society. This is not anyone\'s idea of
progress.\'IS And, in I992, when President Clinton came to office, 48
per cent of the working poor did not have health insurance, and three
years later in I995, despite a \'growth\' economy, the situation was
unchanged; 9.4 million citizens still do not have health insur- ance.i6
Inflation-adjusted wage rates for the median worker fell in the I980s
and continued to decline sharply in the I99Os. From I989 to I997, real
wages for the majority of workers in the middle the vast American middle
class- continued to erode, with the median worker\'s wage falling by 5
per cent since I989.I7 A key factor in the absolute decline in the
living standards of most Americans since the I970S is the amount of
capital spent for non-productive military pur- poses. US military
spending contributed to a decline in competitiveness. For much of the
Cold War, manufacturing productivity growth in most European nations
averaged twice the US rate, and in Japan was often three times that of
the United States. The Europeans and the Japanese could drop the prices
of their goods more quickly than American firms. Investment was a key
factor in productivity growth. US arms production diverted engineers and
scientists from civilian projects. Some of the brightest, most highly
skilled people no longer worked directly to increase the productivity
and competitiveness of the nation\'s manufacturing sector.\'8 Academic
studies from the I980s to the mid-iggos confirm the negative rela-
tionships between militarism and economic growth. Steve Chan, for
example, concludes that the evidence is clear for advanced Western
economies: military spending does not encourage or facilitate sustained
economic growth. In the long run,\'these expenditures are more apt to
have a negative than a positive impact on investment, inflation,
employment, balance of payments, industrial productivity, and economic
growth. The evidence on the United States.. .indi- cates especially
significant costs in these regards.\' Heavy defence spending \'seems to
have a particularly important impact in dampening capital formation and
investment, which in turn reduces economic growth in the long run\'.
Chan also notes the \'customary preference of officials to finance
defense and war by running budget deficits rather than by cutting other
programs or rais- ing taxes, \[with\] much of the cost of this spending
shifted to future genera- tions\'.I9 These conclusions were confirmed in
a I995 study by Alex Mintz and Randolph Stevenson that was grounded
solidly in neoclassical economic the- ory. Using longitudinal data from
I03 countries, they demonstrated that increases in non-military spending
contribute to growth significantly more than increases in military
expenditures. Military expenditures had either a neg- ative effect or no
effect on growth in about go per cent of the cases. Mintz and Stevenson
demonstrated that a shift away from military spending significantly
contributes to economic growth in the long run.20 The central purpose of
economic activity is to create material well-being. A healthy economy
produces and distributes consumer goods and services to sat- isfy
material needs (e.g. refrigerators) and producer goods (e.g. machinery
and transport equipment). Goods or services that do not contribute to
material well-being are opportunities lost and therefore represent
economic costs. The production of military goods and services is a
non-contributing activity. An economy that is persistently dominated by
military production will divert crit- ical economic resources to
non-contributive activities and experience a long- term decline in
productivity. Investment to improve efficiency in the civilian sector
will have been stifled.2I This tendency for defence activities to divert
resources away from public and private investments more able to promote
growth, leads Sandler and Hartley to conclude that the net impact of
defence spending on growth is negative.22 When defence activities take
scarce resources, including research and development funds, from private
investment, long-term growth is impeded. Many argue that high levels of
military spending create jobs. However, according to Robert
DeGrasse,\'most industries selling to the Pentagon create fewer jobs per
dollar spent than the average industry in the American econo- my\'.
DeGrasse has documented how seven of eleven manufacturing industries
selling the greatest volume of goods to the military-including the three
largest, which together account for over 40 per cent of the Pentagon\'s
purchases from the private sector-create fewer jobs per dollar than the
median manu- facturing industry. Three simulations demonstrate that
transferring military expenditures to either civilian government
spending or tax cuts creates higher employment. For example, shifting
\$62.9 billion from military purchases to per- sonal consumption
expenditures created some i . million jobs.23 Moreover, the
Congressional Budget Office of the US Congress, using two different mod-
els of the US economy, concluded in I992 that the use of the peace
dividend to reduce the federal deficit would benefit the economy in the
long run.24 There is also an indirect negative effect of military
spending. Mintz and Huang, for example, analysed the indirect impact of
arms expenditures on education spending. Their empirical study indicated
no negative short-term effects but demonstrated a significant indirect
long-term trade-off between spending on defence and on education. The
negative effect on education was felt to be attributable to the impact
of military policies on investment and growth. Over a \'longer time
period, military spending crowds out investment, which reduces growth,
thereby affecting the amount the government spends on education
programs\'.25 In summary, there are at least three different ways in
which military spend- ing restricts economic growth in the United
States. First, it leads to a decrease in investment and thus retards the
expansion of civilian industry; second, it leads to lower employment and
an inefficient use of labour resources; and third, it takes resources
away from civilian research and development, impeding non- military
innovation and growth and siphoning off highly qualified engineers and
labour from the civilian sector. [The result is a diversion of resources
away from the collective human rights of education, health care and
subsistence]{.underline}. The implementation of basic economic and
social rights depends upon a shift in scarce resources away from
militarism and towards these areas of human need. Militarization, of
course, is a global phenomenon. Expensive and sophisticat- ed weapons
are sought and purchased everywhere in the name of security and
self-determination. Worldwide military spending of \$8i5 billion in I992
equalled the income of nearly half the world\'s people. Military
expenditures in developing countries rose three times as fast as those
of the industrialized coun- tries between I960 and I987; from \$24
billion to \$I45 billion, an increase of 7.5 per cent a year, compared
with 2.8 per cent for the industrialized countries. In I990/I the ratio
of military to social spending (calculated as military expen- ditures as
a percentage of the combined education and health expenditures) was an
astounding 373 per cent in Syria, 222 per cent in Myanmar and I90 per
cent in Ethiopia. Some of the poorest countries are among those which
spend more on their military than on education and health: Angola,
Mozambique, Pakistan, Somalia andYemen, as well as Ethiopia and
Myanmar.26 Did these expenditures provide security? Unfortunately not.
In developing countries, the chances of dying from social neglect (from
malnutrition and preventable diseases) are 33 times greater than the
chances of dying in a war from external aggression.27Yet US arms and
military aid continue to flow to countries that face no significant
external enemy. As a consequence, the function of the military in these
coun- tries often becomes internal repression (as was heinously
demonstrated in Guatemala throughout the ig80s). The human cost of
military spending in developing nations is enormous. The statistics are
numbing. Twelve per cent of military spending in developing countries
could provide funds for primary health care for all, including
immunization of all children, elimination of severe malnutrition and
reduction of moderate malnutrition by half, and provision of safe
drinking water for all. Four per cent could reduce adult illiteracy by
half, provide universal primary education and educate women to the same
level as men. Eight per cent could provide basic family planning to all
and stabilize world population by 20I 5.28

### 2AC Nuclear Reps Good 

#### Ignoring nuclear war between great powers is akin to the process of nuclear forgetting used by the national security establishment to downplay the dangers of the bomb -- reinforces the genocidal logic of deterrence

**Hanson '18** (Marianne, School of Political Science and International
Studies, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, "Normalizing zero
nuclear weapons: The humanitarian road to the Prohibition Treaty,"
*Contemporary Security Policy*, 39:3)

This process of normalization was achieved by the leaders and
strategists within the nuclear states. Gamson (1987) has written of [a
"nuclear forgetting]{.underline}," [where]{.underline} a "[sustained
governmental effort]{.underline} to [downplay atomic
dangers]{.underline}" (p. 16) meant that the realities of nuclear
destruction were largely occluded. Nuclear forgetting has [provided a
sanctuary, where people can avoid confronting the actuality of a nuclear
threat]{.underline} (Ungar, 1992, p. 5), at least [until they are faced
with]{.underline} an [imminent]{.underline} nuclear
[crisis.]{.underline} Thus, normalizing can be seen as the amelioration
or even defusing of nuclear anxieties and the implicit conferring of a
sense of everyday legitimacy (Ungar, 1992, p. 9) onto the "fact" of
nuclear strategy.

For Boyer (1985, p. 15), [nuclear "forgetting" was the outcome of a
"symbolic contest" in which state interests]{.underline}, [or national
security]{.underline}, [came to eclipse the ever-present but
successfully submerged public fears of nuclear war.]{.underline} In a
somewhat different approach, strategists like Kahn (1960) openly
acknowledged the horrors that nuclear war would bring, but argued that
the United States nevertheless would be able to absorb the deaths of
tens of millions of people, and still emerge victoriously: Nuclear war
could be fought, and it could be won.

For a handful of powerful states, therefore, the acquisition and
deployment of these weapons, planning for nuclear warfare, and the
modernizing of their arsenals, has elevated the status of what have been
quintessentially unconventional weapons---abnormal in terms of their
destructive capacity and their actual military utility---into ones seen
by the policy elites within these states as a necessary part of everyday
life. Nuclear weapons came to be accepted and embraced as central
elements of the security doctrines of these states even though there was
a parallel and growing taboo against their use, or at least a norm of
non-use. This was demonstrated by the fact that at the same time that
their presumed use was deeply embedded in the doctrine of deterrence,
their actual use was held to be untenable. These entrenched views about
these weapons---that they are essential for the security and stra- tegic
stability of these states---blocked any real progress in "devaluing"
(Ritchie, 2013) nuclear weapons, a necessary precursor in any efforts to
elim- inate them.

None of this is to suggest that there was no opposition to this state of
affairs or that there was no recognition of the humanitarian
implications of using nuclear weapons. Boyer (1985), for one, noted that
the nuclear debates in the United States between 1945 and 1950 contained
the same anti-nuclear themes which were evident decades later. The
"normal" nature of nuclear weapons has been challenged---especially by
prominent individuals and civil society groups---although never with any
real success, and not by any large grouping of states, as we see today.
From the onset of the nuclear age, disarmament advocates have questioned
the assumptions behind the acquisition and retention of such arsenals on
a number of grounds, but this has not resulted in any serious dislodging
of the acceptance of weapons which might be considered, under other
circumstances, abhorrent and unacceptable.

The [opposition has come from writers and intellectuals]{.underline},
and not just from Western states. The [Kenyan academic
Mazrui]{.underline} (1979), for example, [rejected the system of
"nuclear apartheid]{.underline}," where the P5 states arrogated to
themselves the "right" under the NPT, to keep their weapons, while at
the same time denying such weapons to other states. Noteworthy in the
United States was the early view that resources spent on nuclear weapons
could be spent instead on civil rights programs and on impoverished
black communities (Intondi, 2015). For Mazrui and others, **[there was a
correlation between the struggles for domestic civil rights, global
liberation from colonial rule, and an opposition to nuclear
armaments]{.underline}** (Allman, 2008).

[Many non-nuclear states resented]{.underline} the terms of [the NPT,
even as they had signed up to its provisions, in the hope that the P5
states would live up to their side of the bargain]{.underline} by
complying with Article VI requiring the elimination of their nuclear
arsenals. [The creation of nuclear-weapon free zones]{.underline} (which
[to]{.underline} date [cover the entire southern
hemisphere]{.underline}) [was further testament to the rejection of the
nuclear "norma]{.underline}l," even though these zones did nothing to
stop the United States and Soviet Union increasing their arsenals to a
height of approximately 70,000 weapons by the mid-1980s. For many
developing states, the nuclear order was a "superpower condominium," one
which was increasingly difficult to dislodge (Millar, 1971; Ray, 1987).
Clearly, nuclear weapons were perceived as vitally important in the
deterrent relationship between these adversaries. But the fact that the
nuclear age has persisted so tenaciously---even though the Cold War
ended almost 30 years ago---reflects the extent to which nuclearism has
continued, not just within the nuclear- weapon states and their allies,
but in global security politics more broadly. This persistence brought
with it its own set of assumptions and justified rationalities, making
it difficult to move beyond a paradigm of nuclear- centeredness.

In the early 1980s, Lifton and Falk (1982) devised the term "nuclearism"
to explain what they saw as the "psychological, political, and military
dependence on nuclear weapons, the embrace of \[these\] weapons as a
solution to a wide variety of human dilemmas, most ironically that of
'security'" (p. ix). [Nuclearism allowed a deeply entrenched valuing of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, a tra- ditional framing of these arsenals
which was [about security,]{.underline} nuclear [deterrence,
and]{.underline} even nuclear [war-fighting, but rarely about what would
be the practical consequences of]{.underline} any nuclear
[use.]{.underline} Echoing Lifton and Falk, Taylor (2007) has usefully
contributed to our understanding of what nuclearism is: the result of "a
potent mixture of ideologies including bureaucracy, national- ism,
religious fundamentalism, militarism, technological determinism, and
instrumental rationality" (p. 677).

Nuclearism brought with it a sense of certainty for nuclear-weapon
states, with little room for any who might question or resist its
imposition. For Williams (1980), **[the bomb]{.underline}**, "as fact or
slogan, **[has operated]{.underline}** in the culture **[as a
static]{.underline}** if terrible **[entity, provoking resignation,
cynicism or despair"]{.underline}** (p. 26). Williams noted at the same
time that, "the reality has been the unceasing development of new and
ever more dangerous systems" (p. 26).

[This "unceasing development" of weapons systems has
continued]{.underline} well past the ending of the Cold War, [and is
manifested today in]{.underline} nuclear [modernization
programs]{.underline} being [carried out in every one of the nine
nuclear-weapon states.]{.underline} Attempts to resist nuclearism by
charting a more equitable global security order have been unable to
dislodge the status quo. Essentially, when nuclear weapons have been
discussed at an official level, this has been within strategic,
technological, and political contexts. Rarely have they been assessed
and debated---by large groupings of states---within humanitarian
contexts. Instead, **[ideas about strategic necessity, parity, nuclear
preponderance, and even "winning" a nuclear war]{.underline}** (Kahn,
1960; Payne & Gray, 1980) **[have characterized most]{.underline}** of
the **[thinking]{.underline}** and scholarly research in this field.

There are at least **[three elements]{.underline}** which **[have
compounded]{.underline}** the growth and sustenance of
**[nuclearism]{.underline}**; these are **[first]{.underline}**, [the
relative **absence of humanitarian frameworks** in strategic discourses;
second, **extremely restrictive nuclear policy-making practices**; and
third, the **privileged position accorded to the P5 states** under the
NPT.]{.underline} These will now be examined in turn.

Nuclear weapons: A humanitarian-free zone?

Nuclear weapons rely for their effectiveness on the promise of
widespread and unprecedented levels of destruction. Notwithstanding the
right of states to defend themselves under Article 51 of the UN Charter,
the use of nuclear weapons would violate the tenets of international
humanitarian law, especially those restrictions which require
distinguishing between military and civilian targets, the protection of
civilians, a proportionate use of force, and the need to refrain from
causing superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.

While at a general and abstract level members of the public have been
aware of the effects of nuclear weapons, it suited governments of the
nuclear weapons states not to encourage too close an examination of the
consequences of nuclear-weapon use. State authorities were careful to
preserve a mostly abstracted view of nuclear doctrines, one that avoided
the human costs of nuclear use (Meyer, 1995). Little consideration was
given to effects on the public, apart from the early "duck and cover"
campaigns, and the provision of a few fallout shelters, in the United
States in the early years of the atomic age. The realities that would be
faced by domestic and international communities in the aftermath of any
such strike, in terms of providing effective assistance, and how to
contain radioactive spread, for example, were also largely missing.
(Kahn was an exception here, addressing as he did the physical impacts
of a nuclear strike, which he believed the United States could
successfully absorb.)

[Central to the persistence of]{.underline} this
[nuclearism]{.underline} over a period of 70 years [has been the
creation of a language and dominant discourse which allowed daily
planning for the alleged "unthinkable": the use of nuclear weapons
against not just]{.underline} the leaders and [armies of an enemy state
but also]{.underline} against---indeed [primarily
against]{.underline}---[its people and]{.underline} its [cities. The
construction of a particular discourse surrounding nuclear weapons
allowed for an ordinariness, where these weapons came to be accepted as
central pillars in]{.underline} the [security doctrines]{.underline} of
a small group of powerful states. And **[even as there was a
parallel]{.underline}** and growing **[norm of
non-use]{.underline}**---where their actual use was held to be (mostly)
untenable---**[their presumed use was deeply enshrined in the doctrine
of nuclear deterrence]{.underline}** (Freedman, 2004; Quinlan, 2009).

In other words, thinking and planning for the apparently unthinkable was
common, and **[the growth of a norm of non-use was never enough to
produce an outright rejection]{.underline}** of what had become, during
the Cold War and even after it, quite thinkable. Unsurprisingly, [states
never negotiated or adopted a treaty outlawing explicitly the possession
or use of nuclear weapons.]{.underline} [While such treaties existed
for]{.underline} the other two kinds of weapon of mass destruction---
[chemical and biological weapons]{.underline}---[the absence of a
similar legal prohibition regarding nuclear weapons was a clear
indication]{.underline} that [the P5 was never in favor of]{.underline}
any such [legal proscription.]{.underline}

[Implicit in the programs of the nuclear weapons states was a
persistence of the belief that their arsenals were rational, necessary,
and normal.]{.underline} [But at the same time]{.underline} that this
normality was being constructed and reinforced for them, [any attempts
made by other states to acquire nuclear weapons were seen as
**unnecessary**, **irrational**, and **destabilizing** to global
security. Would-be nuclear states were branded as "**rogues**" or
"**pariahs**" **acting in defiance of well-established norms of
non-proliferation**.]{.underline} As time wore on, the nuclear-weapon
states, and especially the United States, increased their efforts to
stop the spread of these weapons to others considered unfit to become
nuclear states themselves (Harrington de Santana, 2011; Price, 2007). In
doing so, [they had to perform two contradictory tasks: to continue with
their own nuclear possession on the basis of an assumed rationality and
strategic necessity, while at the same time casting attempts made by
other states to acquire nuclear weapons as unnecessary, irrational, and
in violation of the non-proliferation norm.]{.underline}

While this contradictory approach can be explained as simple power
politics where the large and powerful states pursued policies favorable
to them- selves, there nevertheless were difficulties in sustaining such
a position. First, by demonstrating a clear wish to retain a nuclear
deterrent, the nuclear states signaled to other states that nuclear
weapons have a great deal of utility, which in turn makes their case for
global non-proliferation difficult and complicated. Second, the P5
states have repeatedly promised to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Not
only is this enshrined in the NPT, but it is a promise that has also
been re-stated by them at numerous multilateral gatherings. This makes
their continued retention of nuclear weapons a deeply contested issue
which has generated decades of grievance among the non- nuclear states.

Despite the fact that nuclear weapons are the quintessential "weapon of
mass destruction"---leaders of the nuclear-weapon states have been
successful in avoiding this explicit terminology being applied to their
weapons (see Cooper, 2006, p. 365; Mutimer, 2000). A cursory look at the
way nuclear weapons holdings are described in official military policies
in the nuclear states confirms this: One's own weapons are "nuclear
weapons," representing a "nuclear capability." Where the term "weapons
of mass destruction" appears, it is always in relation to the holdings
of nuclear (or chemical or biological) weapons by other states, implied
as being rogues or pariah nations. [The P5 present their nuclear
arsenals as normal elements of an international security
order]{.underline} which is nevertheless [reserved for them
exclusively]{.underline} (see for example the Joint Press Statement made
recently by all P5 states (United States, 2017)). Their linguistic
practices have focused on strategic parity and national security. [This
has been important, not just for differentiating between "responsible"
nuclear states]{.underline} (themselves), [and "irresponsible" others,
but because they have also masked the consequences of using nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} **[The development of this discourse shaped the
debate on nuclear weapons, using jargon and metaphor to deflect
attention away from the reality of injury and death]{.underline}**
(Cohn, 1987; Hilgartner, Bell, & O'Connor, 1982).

This has made it difficult to move beyond a paradigm of
nuclear-centeredness. Even after the ending of the Cold War, it was
evident that there would be no reassessment of what would be the most
appropriate national and inter- national security needs in a vastly
changed political landscape. Rather, as the 1990s passed and the new
century advanced, it was clear that the world would have to continue to
live with nuclearism, on the terms set by the P5 decades earlier.
Certainly the numbers of nuclear weapons dropped significantly after
1991, but at heart, security doctrines remained fixed in a Cold War
time-warp, and the lethality of (even reduced) arsenals remained high
(Kristensen, 2009; Mueller & Schaper, 2004; Stimson Center, 1995a). This
perpetuation of a nuclear culture, despite the end of the superpower
conflict was of great concern to non-nuclear states.

By holding off any serious consideration of the humanitarian
consequences of nuclear weapons' use, elites within the nuclear states
have been able to present this option as something which could indeed be
contemplated (Kahn, 1960; Payne & Gray, 1980). Taylor (2007) observed
that [the language used was designed to suggest "mastery and control" by
ignoring contradic- tions, "by normalizing the presence and use of
nuclear weapons, by obscuring attribution of agency]{.underline} (and
thus accountability) \... [and]{.underline} by [inhibiting ethical
reflection about the consequences of nuclear weapons"]{.underline} (p.
677). [The success- ful construction of this particular set of beliefs
and practices]{.underline}, talked about in abstract and unemotional
language, [allowed the growth of nuclear doctrines, shielded off from
any meaningful external scrutiny and assessment, and per- mitting its
adherents to intensify]{.underline} and replicate their own [dominant
discourse and practices.]{.underline}

It can be argued, of course, that [most instances of warfare have
violated and continue to violate international humanitarian
law.]{.underline} Rarely have we seen a clear regard for the upholding
of the fundamental principles of the laws of war. **[But there are two
important points]{.underline}** to note here. The
**[first]{.underline}** is that **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}**, by
their nature, **[produce a qualitatively different capacity for human
destruction]{.underline}** (when compared against conventional weapons).
**[Second]{.underline}**, notwithstanding violations of humanitarian law
in the past, or indeed ongoing ones, [there are expectations at the
broad level that **warfare should abide by these
guidelines**]{.underline}, including the Geneva conventions revised
after the Second World War to include civilians.

Nuclear weapons: Decision-making by the few

The reality of the dominant nuclear security discourse was that
[governments were able to keep nuclear decision-making isolated from
public oversight.]{.underline} Booth (1999) has pointed to the
cumulative effects of this arrangement: For him, **[plans for nuclear
deterrence and nuclear war affirmed an idea that "national security can
only ultimately rest on genocidal threats"]{.underline}** (p. 21). In
other words, [rendering as "normal" the securing of one's own interests
largely at the expense of mass killing of others was]{.underline}, for
Booth, [an erosion of liberal principles, the institutionalization of a
zero-sum security outlook impervious to change.]{.underline} While in
various ways this has always been the case with war and violent
conflict, it becomes more problematic when we are contemplating nuclear
warfare.

says that Russia poses a particularly active threat to the U.S.-led
world order.]{.underline} The document warns that **[America is
underestimating Russian aggression and is not prepared to deal with the
wide range of techniques used by Moscow to undermine democracies
worldwide]{.underline}**. The \"Strategic Multilayer Assessment\"
suggests [the U.S. is entering a new period of ideological competition

that [America lacks a clear ideological message of the kind that carried
it through the Cold War.]{.underline} Belinda Bragg, a research
scientist for the NSI government consulting firm, wrote parts of the
study. She said that the U.S. needs \"to better articulate U.S.
interests and strategy to both ourselves and others.\" Another
contributor, Anna Borshchevskaya of the Washington Institute for Near
East Policy, added that domestic divisions are damaging efforts to
create a new American identity. \"We still have a story to tell but
because we are so polarized and are doubting ourselves we have a
narrative problem,\" she told Politico. \"Russia does not.\" [The report
detailed the methods Russia is using to undermine the U.S. and its
traditional allies]{.underline}. [Navy Rear Admiral Jeffrey Czerewko,
the Joint Chiefs\' deputy director for global operations, listed
\"**economic competition, influence campaigns, paramilitary actions,
cyber intrusions, and political warfare**]{.underline},\" [all of which
he expected to become more common]{.underline}. Contributor Jason
Werchan, a member of the U.S. European Command strategy division, wrote
that [malign Russian activities include \"threatening other states
militarily, or compromising their societies, economies, and governments

world system, and America\'s influence in it, would be completed upended
if Moscow and Beijing aligned more closely,\" Werchan suggested. The
document also suggests steps that could undermine the relationship, such
as sowing concern in Russia about China\'s mammoth economic and
infrastructure projects across the globe. Ultimately, the authors note
that Russia\'s greatest weakness is its most powerful man: Putin. Thomas
Sherlock, a professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point,
gathered data for the study. He noted \"relatively weak approval among
the \[Russian\] public for a forceful external posture, including
intervention in the \'near abroad\' to check American power or protect
Russian-speakers from perceived discrimination.\" [The network of
oligarchs that keeps Putin in power is also a weak spot for his
authoritarian regime. \"While both elites and members of the mass public
are supportive of restoring Russia\'s great power status, they often
define a great power and its priorities more in terms of socio-economic
development than in the production and demonstration of hard power,\"
the report reads. \"These perspectives increasingly come into conflict
with those of the Kremlin.\"]{.underline}

### 2AC Warming Reps Good 

#### **Our simulation of environmental diplomacy is good -- integration of ecological concerns into IR creates a psychological preference for cooperation and a future-oriented ethos in students** 

**Ali & Mueller 10** (Saleem, Professor of Environmental Studies,
University of Vermont, Markus, assistant professor for social and
organizational psychology at Catholic University Eichstaett-Ingolstadt,
Germany, "Simulating Environmental Diplomacy", June 23, 2010,
http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/innovations/data/000168)

[Environmental policy issues are often framed in terms of resource
scarcity]{.underline}, spurring a scramble for that last blade of grass
or last drop of water in a \"tragedy of the commons.\" [Yet human
perceptions]{.underline} of access to resources [can be shifted
from]{.underline} a mindset of [competitive conflict to]{.underline} one
of [cooperative relationships]{.underline}. [The psychological
aspects]{.underline} of such a transformation [are]{.underline} often
[best illustrated **through simulations**]{.underline}. For example, [a
distributive conflict]{.underline} premised on resource quantity [can be
reframed to highlight cooperation]{.underline} in maintaining resource
quality. Lakes present a classic example where it is easy to show how a
common resource will be degraded for all users. A similar case is harder
to make in river simulations where upstream parties have far greater
power and much less to lose as a result of pollution or scarcity
downstream. [Lessons from these simulation techniques are under-utilized
in international diplomacy]{.underline}. Not only can simulations be
useful in changing the narrative of environmental conflicts, but
**[environmental issues can be useful in changing the tone of political
conflicts]{.underline}**. For example, **[if two countries distrust each
other over religious or ethnic differences, environmental cooperation
may present a]{.underline}** neutral **[means of building
bridges]{.underline}**. Building a Methodology [A simulation
can]{.underline} also [be useful as an experimental tool to further
evaluate the efficacy of environmental factors in conflict
resolution]{.underline}. What would such a methodology look like? [We
might start by using vignettes that describe conflicts between
stakeholders from neighboring nations]{.underline}---with students,
border military guards, and political activists as participants in the
simulation. [The inclusion of environmental issues in the conflict
descriptions would be the main]{.underline} independent
[variable]{.underline}. The level of severity would also vary in the
vignettes, as would its impact on vested interests. The conflicts could
range from environmental threats as a common aversion (like the scarcity
of water or other resources), to nature as an end in itself that should
be protected (perhaps a transboundary protected area without important
natural resources), to situations without environmental issues. In order
to separate the effect of environmental issues from the effect of
cooperative discussion itself, a control group could be told that the
two countries are cooperating over trade talks. [We expect the
**inclusion of environmental issues to affect the willingness of the two
parties to positively cooperate**]{.underline}, given some initial
research from the field of conservation psychology. In a typical
vignette, participants might read about an incident between two
neighboring countries in which citizens of one country were accidentally
killed when military exercises by the other country mistakenly shelled
the wrong target. (For student participants, this would be presented as
a real incident. For the senior diplomats, who are better informed, we
would merely ask them to treat this as a hypothetical incident.) Some of
the participants will also be told that the two countries are engaged in
cooperative discussions over how to protect a shared environmentally
sensitive area. Others will be told that the two countries are engaged
in discussions over how to allocate shared, and contested, water
resources. A third group will be told that the two countries are engaged
in cooperative trade talks, and a last group will not be told about any
discussions between the two countries. The exact mechanics of the
simulation would be worked out after a series of consultations with
experts on behavioral methodologies and the running of test groups.
Dependent variable measures for the vignettes as well as the ensuing
studies will include resource allocation between groups, stereotyping of
the \"other,\" moral exclusion of the other, perceived justice, as well
as the willingness to employ different strategies of negotiation.
Assessment of one party\'s willingness to interact with the other group
will be adapted for each vignette from the Transgression-Related
Interpersonal Motivations Inventory, a widely used method in psychology.
This technique has previously been adapted for similar use to assess
attitudes about appropriate relations between nations. Sample items
would be: \"Country A should continue to cooperate with country B,\"
\"Country A should avoid involvement with Country B,\" \"Country A
should forgive Country B,\" \"Country A should fear future aggressive
actions by Country B\" (scaled 1--5, strongly disagree to strongly
agree). In other words, [people do not have to choose between
identifying with the original group or identifying with the larger
collective; they can identify with both]{.underline}. [When groups
cooperate, they develop trust in each other as well as a perception of
shared characteristics]{.underline}. [Working together to protect a
shared ecosystem may allow nations to experience the same
effects]{.underline}: [Trust that is established through work on one
project may generalize to a greater level of trust on other
issues]{.underline}; perceived similarity in value for nature may help
to overcome tendencies toward stereotyping and moral exclusion. The
Horizon of Cooperation Yet another potential mechanism of the
psychological impact of peace parks is in encouraging a reduction of
temporal discounting. Although this work is still in the preliminary
stages, there is some evidence that [consideration of environmental
issues promotes a longer time horizon compared to some other
issues]{.underline}. Robert Axelrod empirically showed in his classic
work The Evolution of Cooperation that [increasing the \"shadow of the
future\"]{.underline} ([the likelihood and importance of future
interaction]{.underline}) [promotes cooperation]{.underline}. [**If we
can frame environmental issues in the context of longer-term
interactions between humans and the planet**, there are likely to be
derivative cooperative benefits from this mechanism]{.underline}. [Such
an approach would blend the use of simulations in collaborative planning
with psychological techniques]{.underline}---potentially offering a
mechanism for \"ecological cooperation.\" In August 2010, the American
Psychological Association is hosting a special session on environment,
peace, and conflict at which we intend to discuss the prospects for
engaging in research to test this hypothesis with actual stakeholders in
a conflict situation. In the meantime, [scholars]{.underline},
practitioners, [and students can consider testing this proposition on
their own, experimenting with different ecological
vignettes]{.underline}. There can also be variations in the simulation
before and after environmental education programs to evaluate the
effectiveness of ecoliteracy programs. [Environmental awareness, coupled
with strong leadership in using ecological variables in diplomacy, may
well provide us with a new policy innovation for dealing with
intractable conflicts]{.underline}.

### 2AC Warming Reps Good 

#### The 1ac's narrative of environmental risk is motivating and drives individual activism -- proves we've performed our pedagogy and it's preferable to the alt

**Veldman '12** (Robin, PhD Candidate Religion and Nature at U of
Florida National Foundation Fellow at the Integrative Graduate Education
and Research Traineeship, Spring, "Narrating the Environmental
Apocalypse: How Imagining the End Facilitates Moral Reasoning Among
Environmental Activists" Ethics and the Environment, Vol 17 No 1)

Environmental Apocalypticism and Activism As we saw in the introduction,
critics often argue that apocalyptic rhetoric induces feelings of
hopelessness or fatalism. While it certainly does for some people, in
this section I will present evidence that [apocalypticism]{.underline}
also [often goes hand in hand with activism]{.underline}.¶ Some of the
strongest evidence of a connection between environmental apocalypticism
and activism comes from a national survey that examined whether
Americans perceived climate change to be dangerous. As part of his
analysis, Anthony Leiserowitz identified several "interpretive
communities," which had consistent demographic characteristics but
varied in their levels of risk perception. [The group who perceived the
risk to be the greatest]{.underline}, which he labeled "alarmists,"
[described climate change]{.underline} \[End Page 5\] [using apocalyptic
language, such as]{.underline} "Bad...bad...bad...like [after nuclear
war...no vegetation]{.underline}," "Heat waves, it's gonna kill the
world," [and "Death of the planet]{.underline}" (2005, 1440). Given such
language, this would seem to be a reasonable way to operationalize
environmental apocalypticism. [If such apocalypticism encouraged
fatalism, we would expect alarmists to be less likely to have engaged in
environmental behavior]{.underline} compared to groups with moderate or
low levels of concern. **[To the contrary]{.underline}**, however,
[Leiserowitz found that alarmists "were significantly more likely to
have taken personal action to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}" (ibid.) [than respondents who perceived climate
change to pose less of a threat]{.underline}. Interestingly, while one
might expect such radical views to appeal only to a tiny minority,
Leiserowitz found that [a respectable eleven percent of Americans fell
into this group]{.underline} (ibid).¶ Further supporting Leiserowitz's
findings, [in a separate national survey]{.underline} conducted in 2008,
Maibach, Roser-Renouf, and Leiserowitz found that [a group]{.underline}
they [labeled "the Alarmed]{.underline}" (again, due to their high
levels of concern about climate change) "[are]{.underline} the segment
[most engaged in the issue of global warming. They are very convinced it
is happening, human-caused, and a serious and urgent threat. The Alarmed
are already making changes in their own lives and support an aggressive
national response]{.underline}" (2009, 3, emphasis added). [This group
was far more likely than people with lower levels of concern over
climate change to have engaged in consumer activism]{.underline} (by
rewarding companies that support action to reduce global warming with
their business, for example) or to have contacted elected officials to
express their concern. Additionally, the authors found that ["\[w\]hen
asked which reason for action was most important]{.underline} to them
personally, [the Alarmed were most likely to select preventing the
destruction of most life on the planet]{.underline} (31%)" (2009,
31)---a finding suggesting that for many in this group [it is
specifically the desire to avert catastrophe, rather than some other
motivation, that encourages pro-environmental behavior]{.underline}.
Taken together, these and other studies (cf. Semenza et al. 2008 and
DerKarabetia, Stephenson, and Poggi 1996) provide important evidence
that [many of those who think environmental problems pose a severe
threat practice some form of activism, rather than giving way to
fatalistic resignation]{.underline}.¶ National surveys give a good
overview of the association between apocalypticism and activism among
the general public, but they do not \[End Page 6\] provide sufficient
ethnographic detail. To complement this broader picture I now turn to
case studies, which provide greater insight into how adherents
themselves understand what motivates their environmental behavior.¶ When
seeking a subset of environmentalists with apocalyptic beliefs, the
radical wing is an obvious place to look. For example, many Earth
First!ers believe that the collapse of industrial society is inevitable
(Taylor 1994). At the same time, the majority are actively committed to
preventing ecological disaster. As Earth First! co-founder Howie Wolke
acknowledged, the two are directly connected: "As ecological calamity
unravels the living fabric of the Earth, environmental radicalism has
become both common and necessary" (1989, 29).3 This logic underlies
efforts to preserve wilderness areas, which many radical
environmentalists believe will serve as reservoirs of genetic diversity,
helping to restore the planet after industrial society collapses (Taylor
1994). [In addition to encouraging activism to preserve wilderness,
apocalyptic beliefs also motivate]{.underline} practices such as
"monkeywrenching," or ecological sabotage, civil disobedience, and the
more conventional "[paper monkeywrenching" (lobbying, engaging in public
information campaigns to shift legislative priorities]{.underline}, or
using lawsuits when these tactics fail). Ultimately, while there are
disagreements over what strategies will best achieve their desired
goals, for most radical environmentalists, apocalypticism and activism
are bound closely together.¶ The connection between belief in impending
disaster and environmental activism holds true for Wiccans as well.
During fieldwork in the southeastern United States, for example, Shawn
Arthur reported meeting "dozens of Wiccans who professed their
apocalyptic millenarian beliefs to anyone who expressed interest, yet
many others only quietly agreed with them without any further
elaboration" (2008, 201). For this group, the coming disaster was
understood as divine retribution, the result of an angry Earth Goddess
preparing to punish humans for squandering her ecological gifts (Arthur
2008, 203). In light of Gaia's impending revenge, Arthur found that
Wiccans advocated both spiritual and material forms of activism. For
example, practices such as Goddess worship, the use of herbal remedies
for healing, and awareness of the body and its energies were considered
important for initiating a more harmonious relationship with the earth
(Arthur 2008, 207). As for material activism, Arthur notes \[End Page
7\] that the notion of environmental apocalypse played a key role in
encouraging pro-environmental behavior:¶ images of immanent \[sic\]
ecological crisis and apocalyptic change often were utilized as
motivating factors for developing an environmentally and ecologically
conscious worldview; for stressing the importance of working for the
Earth through a variety of practices, including environmental activism,
garbage collecting, recycling, composting, and religious rituals; for
learning sustainable living skills; and for developing a special
relationship with the world as a divine entity. (2008, 212)¶ What these
studies and my own experiences in the environmentalist milieu4 suggest
is that [people who make a serious commitment to engaging in
environmentally friendly behavior, people who move beyond making
superficial changes to making substantial and permanent ones, are quite
likely to subscribe to some form of the apocalyptic
narrative]{.underline}.¶ All this is not to say that apocalypticism
directly or inevitably causes activism, or that believing catastrophe is
imminent is the only reason people become activists. However, it is to
say that [activism and apocalypticism are associated]{.underline} for
some people, [and]{.underline} that [this association is not
arbitrary]{.underline}, for [there is something uniquely powerful and
compelling about the apocalyptic narrative]{.underline}. Plenty of
people will hear it and ignore it, or find it implausible, or simply
decide that if the situation really is so dire there is nothing they can
do to prevent it from continuing to deteriorate. Yet [to focus only on
the ability of apocalyptic rhetoric to induce apathy, indifference or
reactance is to ignore the evidence that it also fuels quite the
opposite]{.underline}---grave concern, activism, and sometimes even
outrage. It is also to ignore the movement's history. From Silent Spring
(Carson \[1962\] 2002) to The Limits to Growth (Meadows et al 1972) to
The End of Nature (McKibben 1989), apocalyptic arguments have held a
prominent place within environmental literature, topping best-seller
lists and spreading the message far and wide that protecting the
environment should be a societal priority. Thus, while it is not a style
of argument that will be effective in convincing everyone to commit to
the environmental cause (see Feinberg and Willer 2011), there does
appear to be a close relationship between apocalyptic belief and
activism among a certain minority. The next section explores the
implications of that relationship further. \[End Page 8\]¶ The
Apocalyptic Narrative as a Framework for Moral Deliberation¶ In
discussing how apocalypticism functions within the environmental
community, it will be helpful to analyze it as a type of narrative. I do
so because the domain of narrative includes both the stories that people
read and write, as well as those they tell and live by. By using
narratives as data, scholars can analyze experiential and textual
sources simultaneously (Polkinghorne 1988; Riessman 2000).¶ To analyze
environmental apocalypticism as a type of narrative is not to suggest
that apocalyptics' claims about the future are fictional. Rather, it is
to highlight that the facts to which [environmentalists appeal have been
organized with particular goals in mind]{.underline}, goals which have
necessarily shaped the selection and presentation of those facts.
[Compelling environmental writers do not simply list every known fact
pertaining to the natural world, but instead select certain findings and
place them within a larger interpretive framework. Alone, each fact has
little meaning, but when woven into a larger narrative, a message
emerges. This process of narrativization is essential if a message is to
be **persuasive**]{.underline} (Killingsworth and Palmer 2000, 197), and
has occurred not only in the rapidly expanding genre of environmental
nonfiction, but in much scientific writing about the environment as well
(Harré, Brockmeier, and Mühlhäusler 1999, 69).¶ [What defines narratives
as such is their beginning-middle-end structure]{.underline}, their
ability to "describe an action that begins, continues over a
well-defined period of time, and finally draws to a definite close"
(Cronon 1992, 1367). Here I will focus on the last of these elements,
the ending, because anything we can learn about how endings function
within narratives in general will be applicable to the apocalypse, the
most final ending of all.¶ An ending is essential in order for a story
to be complete, but there is more to it than this. Endings are also key
because they establish a story's moral, the lesson it is supposed to
impart upon the reader. In other words, to know the moral of the story,
auditors must know the consequences of the actions depicted therein, so
there can be no moral without an ending. To take a simple example, when
we hear the story of the shepherd boy who falsely claims that a wolf is
attacking his flock of sheep in order to entertain himself at his
community's expense, what makes the lesson clear is that when a wolf
does attack his flock, the disenchanted town members refuse to come to
his aid. By clearly illustrating how telling lies can have \[End Page
9\] unpleasant consequences for the perpetrator, the ending reveals the
moral that lying is wrong. As Cronon explains, it is "\[t\]he difference
between beginning and end \[that\] gives us our chance to extract a
moral from the rhetorical landscape" (1992, 1370).¶ Endings play a
similar role in environmental stories. In Al Gore's book Earth in the
Balance (1992), for example, he devotes over a third of the book's pages
to presenting scientific evidence that disaster is imminent.5 As he sums
it up, "Modern industrial civilization...is colliding violently with our
planet's ecological system. The ferocity of its assault on the earth is
breathtaking, and the horrific consequences are occurring so quickly as
to defy our capacity to recognize them" (1992, 269). He builds this
argument so carefully precisely because if the ending does not seem
credible, the moral he wants readers to draw from the story will not be
compelling. [If]{.underline} his [readers are not convinced that the
ending to this story of ecological misbehavior will be a debacle of
colossal proportions, they will not become convinced that they need to
dramatically alter their ecological behavior]{.underline}. Thus the
vision of future catastrophe that Gore presents provides a crucial
vantage point from which the present environmental situation can be
understood as the result of a grand moral failure, and Gore's readers
are made aware of their obligations in light of it. Gore himself
appreciates the importance of this recognition, arguing that "whether we
realize it or not, we are now engaged in an epic battle to right the
balance of our earth, and the tide of this battle will turn only when
the majority of people in the world become sufficiently aroused by a
shared sense of urgent danger to join an all-out effort" (1992, 269,
emphasis added). Here, as in so many other stories, the ending must be
in place for the moral to become clear.¶ To say that endings are
essential in order for stories to have morals is already to hint that
[stories alter behavior,]{.underline} that [they can encourage action in
the real world even as they invoke an **imaginary** one]{.underline}.
This much is clear from Earth in the Balance (1992): Gore does not just
want people to grasp a moral, to perceive some ethic in the
abstract---he wants them change their behavior in the here and now. In
constructing a narrative with this goal in mind, he is banking on the
ability of powerful stories to motivate social change, to be, as Cronon
puts it, "our chief moral compass in the world" (1992, 1375).¶ Mark
Johnson's insightful synthesis of cognitive science and philosophy helps
explain further how this process of moral guidance occurs. For \[End
Page 10\] Johnson, narrative is fundamental to our experience of
reality, "the most comprehensive means we have for constructing temporal
syntheses that bind together and unify our past, present, and future
into more or less meaningful patterns" (1993, 174). [Narratives are also
critical to our ability to reason morally, an activity
which]{.underline} Johnson asserts [is fundamentally
imaginative]{.underline}. In this view, [we use stories to imagine
ourselves in different scenarios, exploring and evaluating the
consequences of different possible actions in order to determine the
right one]{.underline}. Moral deliberation is thus¶ ...an imaginative
exploration of the possibilities for constructive action within a
present situation. [We have a problem to solve here and now]{.underline}
(e.g., 'What am I to do?'.... 'How should I treat others?'), [and we
must try out various possible continuations of our narrative in search
of the one that seems best to resolve the indeterminacy of our present
situation]{.underline}. (1993, 180)¶ Put another way, what cognitive
science has revealed is that [from an empirical perspective the process
of moral deliberation entails constructing narratives rooted in our
unique history and circumstances, rather than applying universal
principles]{.underline} (such as Kant's categorical imperative) [to
particular cases. That we use narratives to reason morally is not a
result of conscious choice but of how human cognition
works]{.underline}. That is, insofar as we experience ourselves as
temporal beings, a narrative framework is necessary to organize,
explain, and ultimately justify the many individual decisions that over
time become a life. Formal principles may be useful in unambiguous
textbook cases, but in real life "we can almost never decide
(reflectively) how to act without considering the ways in which we can
continue our narrative construction of our situation" (Johnson 1993,
160). Empirically speaking, "our moral reasoning is situated within our
narrative understanding" (Johnson 1993, 180, italics in original).¶ The
observation that people use narratives to reason morally may help
explain the association between environmental apocalypticism and
activism. [The function of the apocalyptic narrative may be that it
helps adherents determine how to act by **providing a storyline** from
which they can imaginatively sample, enabling them to assess the
consequences of their actions]{.underline}. In order to answer the
question, "Should I drive or walk to the store?" for example, they can
reason, "If I walk, that will reduce my carbon footprint, which will
help keep the ice caps from melting, saving humans and other species."
It is their [access to this narrative of impending]{.underline} \[End
Page 11\] [disaster]{.underline} that [makes such reasoning possible,
for it provides a simple framework within which people can consider and
eventually arrive at some conclusion about their moral
obligations]{.underline}.6 More broadly, it can guide entire lives by
providing a narrative frame of reference that imbues the individual's
experiences with meaning. For example, it is the context of looming
anthropogenic apocalypse which suggests that dedicating one's life to
achieving a healthier relationship with the natural world is a
worthwhile endeavor. [Absent the apocalypse, choices such as limiting
one's travel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}, becoming
vegetarian, working in the environmental sector (often for less
compensation), or growing one's own food [could seem to be meaningless
sacrifices]{.underline}. Within this context, on the other hand, such
choices become essential features of the quest to live a moral life.¶
[The apocalyptic narrative]{.underline} is but one of many ways to tell
the environmental story, yet it is one that [seems **particularly
well-suited** to encouraging **pro-environmental
behavior**]{.underline}. First, [the apocalyptic ending discloses
certain everyday decisions as moral decisions. Without the narrative
context of impending disaster, decisions such as whether to drive or
walk to the store would be merely matters of convenience or
preference]{.underline}. In the context of potentially disastrous
consequences for valued places, people, and organisms, by contrast, such
decisions become matters of right and wrong. Second, [putting
information about the environment into narrative form enables
apocalyptics to link complex global environmental processes to their own
lives]{.underline}, a perceptual technique Thomashow describes as
"bringing the biosphere home" (2002). Developing this skill is essential
because [without that felt sense of connection to their own lived
experience, people are much less likely to become convinced that it is
incumbent upon them to act]{.underline} (2002, 2). Finally, the sheer
magnitude of the impending disaster increases the feeling of
responsibility to make good on one's moral intuitions. By locating
individuals within a drama of ultimate concern, the narrative frames
their choices as cosmically important, and this feeling of urgency then
helps to convert moral deliberation into action. With this conceptual
overview in place, we can now examine more closely what the relationship
between apocalypticism and moral reasoning looks like in practice. \[End

### 2AC Generic Threats Real

#### No threat inflation - even if predictions aren't perfect, threats are real and only an analysis that prioritizes high magnitude scenarios can solve 

**Ravenal '09** (Earl, Professor Emeritus at the Edmund A. Walsh School
of Foreign Service and the Department of Government at Georgetown
University, "What\'s Empire Got to Do with It? The Derivation of
America\'s Foreign Policy," Critical Review: An Interdisciplinary
Journal of Politics and Society 21.1, 21-75)

Rummaging through the concomitants of "imperialism," Eland (2004, 65)
discovers the thesis of ["threat inflation"]{.underline} (in this case,
virtual threat invention): Obviously, much higher spending for the
military, homeland security, and foreign aid are required for a policy
of global intervention than for a policy of merely defending the
republic. For example, after the cold war, the security bureaucracies
began looking for new enemies to justify keeping defense and
intelligence budgets high. Similarly, Eland (ibid., 183), in a section
entitled "Imperial Wars Spike Corporate Welfare," attributes a large
portion of the U.S. defense budget---particularly the procurement of
major weapons systems, such as "Virginia‐class submarines ... aircraft
carriers ... F‐22 fighters ... \[and\] Osprey tilt‐rotor transport
aircraft"---not to the systemically derived requirement for certain
kinds of military capabilities, but, rather, to the imperatives of
corporate pork. He opines that such weapons have no strategic or
operational justification; that "the American empire, militarily more
dominant than any empire in world history, can fight brushfire wars
against terrorists and their 'rogue' state sponsors without those
gold‐plated white elephants." The underlying notion of "the security
bureaucracies ... looking for new enemies" [is a threadbare concept that
has somehow taken hold across the political spectrum]{.underline}, from
the radical left (viz. Michael Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat
bank"), to the liberal center (viz. Robert H. Johnson \[1997\], who
dismisses most alleged "threats" as "improbable dangers"), to
libertarians (viz. Ted Galen Carpenter \[1992\], Vice President for
Foreign and Defense Policy of the Cato Institute, who wrote a book
entitled A Search for Enemies). [What is missing from most analysts'
claims of "threat inflation," however, is a convincing theory of
why]{.underline}, say, the American government significantly (not merely
in excusable rhetoric) might magnify and even invent threats (and, more
seriously, act on such inflated threat estimates). In a few places,
[Eland]{.underline} (2004, 185) [suggests that such behavior might stem
from military or national security bureaucrats' attempts to enhance
their personal status and organizational budgets]{.underline}, or even
from the influence and dominance of "the military‐industrial complex";
viz.: "Maintaining the empire and retaliating for the blowback from that
empire keeps what President Eisenhower called the military‐industrial
complex fat and happy." Or, in the same section: In the nation's
capital, [vested interests]{.underline}, such as the law enforcement
bureaucracies ... [routinely take advantage of "crises"]{.underline}to
satisfy parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to
get pet projects--- a.k.a. pork---funded by the government. And national
security crises, because of people's fears, are especially ripe
opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182) Thus,
"bureaucratic‐politics" theory, which once made several reputations
(such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin, and Graham Allison)
in defense‐intellectual circles, and spawned an entire sub‐industry
within the field of international relations, 5 is put into the service
of dismissing putative security threats as imaginary. So, too, can a
surprisingly cognate theory, "public choice," 6 which can be considered
the right‐wing analog of the "bureaucratic‐politics" model, and is a
preferred interpretation of governmental decision‐making among
libertarian observers. As Eland (2004, 203) summarizes: [Public‐choice
theory argues]{.underline} \[that\] [the government]{.underline} itself
[can develop separate interests from its citizens]{.underline}. The
government reflects the interests of powerful pressure groups and the
interests of the bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although
this problem occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more
severe in foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies
that affect them less directly. There is, in this statement of
public‐choice theory, a certain ambiguity, and a certain degree of
contradiction: [Bureaucrats are supposedly, at the same time,
subservient]{.underline} to societal interest groups [and
autonomous]{.underline} from society in general. This journal has
pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely consequence of
the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity (e.g., Somin
1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But state
autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute their own
interests for those of what could be called the "national society" that
they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that, precisely
because of the public‐ignorance and elite‐expertise factors, and
especially because the opportunities---at least for bureaucrats (a few
notable post‐government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)---for lucrative
self‐dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and diplomatic areas
of government than they are in some of the contract‐dispensing and more
under‐the‐radar‐screen agencies of government, the "public‐choice"
imputation of self‐dealing, rather than working toward the national
interest (which, however may not be synonymous with the interests,
perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is less likely to hold. In short,
state autonomy is likely to mean, in the derivation of foreign policy,
that "state elites" are using rational judgment, in insulation from
self‐promoting interest groups---about what strategies, forces, and
weapons are required for national defense. Ironically, "public
choice"---not even a species of economics, but rather a kind of
political interpretation---is not even about "public" choice, since,
like the bureaucratic‐politics model, it repudiates the very notion that
bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they are held,
axiomatically, to exhibit "rent‐seeking" behavior, wherein they abuse
their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at least to
build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches. Such
sub‐rational models actually explain very little of what they purport to
observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding the
"behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances, under
some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that they
posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives. My treatment of "role" differs from that of the
bureaucratic‐politics theorists, whose model of the derivation of
foreign policy depends heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and
specific identification of the role‐playing of organizationally situated
individuals in a partly conflictual "pulling and hauling" process that
"results in" some policy outcome. Even here, bureaucratic‐politics
theorists Graham Allison and Philip Zelikow (1999, 311) allow that "some
players are not able to articulate \[sic\] the governmental politics
game because their conception of their job does not legitimate such
activity." This is a crucial admission, and one that
points---empirically---to the need for a broader and generic treatment
of role.[Roles]{.underline} (all theorists state) [give rise to
"expectations" of performance. My point is that virtually every
governmental role, and especially national‐security roles, and
particularly]{.underline} the roles of [the]{.underline} uniformed
[military]{.underline}, [embody expectations of devotion to the
"national interest"]{.underline}; [rationality in the derivation of
policy]{.underline} at every functional level; [and objectivity in the
treatment of parameters]{.underline}, especially external parameters
[such as "threats"]{.underline} and the power and capabilities of other
nations. [Sub‐rational models]{.underline} (such as "public choice")
[fail to take into account even a partial dedication to the "national"
interest]{.underline} (or even the possibility that the national
interest may be honestly misconceived in more parochial terms). [In
contrast, an official's role connects the individual to the]{.underline}
(state‐level) [process, and moderates the]{.underline} (perhaps
otherwise) [self‐seeking impulses of the individual]{.underline}.
[Role‐derived behavior tends to be formalized and codified]{.underline};
relatively [transparent and]{.underline} at least
[peer‐reviewed]{.underline}, so as to be consistent with expectations;
[surviving the particular individual and transmitted to successors and
ancillaries]{.underline}; [measured against a standard]{.underline} and
thus corrigible; [defined in terms of]{.underline} the performed
[function]{.underline} and therefore derived from the state function;
[and uncorrrupt, because]{.underline} personal [cheating
and]{.underline} even egregious [aggrandizement are conspicuously
discouraged]{.underline}. My own direct observation suggests that
[defense decision‐makers attempt to "frame" the structure of the
problems that they try to solve on the basis of the most accurate
intelligence]{.underline}. [They make it their business to know where
the threats come from]{.underline}. Thus, [threats are not "socially
constructed"]{.underline} (even though, of course, some values are). [A
major reason for]{.underline} the [rationality, and]{.underline} the
[objectivity]{.underline}, of the process [is that much security
planning is done, not in vaguely undefined circumstances that offer
scope for idiosyncratic, subjective behavior, but rather in structured
and reviewed organizational frameworks]{.underline}.
[Non‐rationalities]{.underline} (which are bad for understanding and
prediction[) tend to get filtered out]{.underline}. [People are fired
for presenting skewed analysis and for making bad
predictions]{.underline}. This is because [something important is riding
on the causal analysis and the contingent prediction]{.underline}. For
these reasons, "public choice" does not have the "feel" of reality to
many critics who have participated in the structure of defense
decision‐making. In that structure, obvious, and even not‐so‐obvious,
["rent‐seeking" would not only be shameful; it would present a severe
risk of career termination]{.underline}. And, as mentioned, [the defense
bureaucracy is hardly a productive place for truly talented rent‐seekers
to operate]{.underline}, [compared to opportunities for personal profit
in the commercial world]{.underline}. A bureaucrat's very self‐placement
in these reaches of government testifies either to a sincere commitment
to the national interest or to a lack of sufficient imagination to
exploit opportunities for personal profit.

## 2AC Perm Cards 

### 2AC Reform Security

#### Perm do the aff and all non-mutually exclusive parts of the alternative. Security is not entrenched in politics -- analysis can be changed to reflect multiple perspectives 

**Loader** **and** **Walker '07** (Ian, Professor of Criminology and
Professorial Fellow of All Souls College, and Neil, University of
Edinburgh, School of Law, *Civilizing Security*, Ch. 4)

Yet [critical work in]{.underline} policing and [security studies
remains]{.underline}, in our view, [skewed in its account of these
associations]{.underline}. [It concludes too easily]{.underline} from
the above **[that there can be no progressive democratic
politics]{.underline}** aimed at civilizing security, **[that security
is so stained]{.underline}** by its uncivil association with the
(military and police) state [and its monolithic affects and effects,
that the only radical strategy left open is to deconstruct and move
beyond it]{.underline} (e.g. Dillon 1996: ch. 1). In so doing, [this
strand of state scepticism]{.underline} **[commits two
mistakes]{.underline}**, both of which flow from its failure to
appreciate or at least sufficiently to acknowledge what we tried to
demonstrate in an earlier section of the chapter; namely, that [state
policing,]{.underline} [however culpable]{.underline} it might be [in
exacerbating certain of the tensions involved in applying general order
in any particular context]{.underline}, [is not the fixed and
fundamental source of these tensions]{.underline}. [It
forgets,]{.underline} first of all, [that while the affective
connections between security]{.underline}, [state and nation are deeply
entrenched,]{.underline} [they take no necessary or essential
substantive form]{.underline}. [They can, in other words, be remade and
reimagined in ways that **connect policing and security to other more
inclusive, cosmopolitan forms of belonging**]{.underline} - **[to
political communities that \'do not necessarily equate difference with
threat]{.underline}**\* (Dalby 1997: 9). [It tends,]{.underline}
secondly, [to forget that the \'pursuit of security\']{.underline}
through general order **[is not only the product of forms of
technocratic, authoritarian government that impoverishes our sense of
the political]{.underline}** (Dillon 1996: 15). [Security, in the sense
of a broadly responsive and acceptable conception of order]{.underline},
[can also be, and indeed]{.underline} - if we examine the political
aspirations which preceded and have survived the modern state - must
also be, **[conceived of in a prior and abstract sense as a valuable
human good]{.underline}**, [one that in concrete application is a key
ingredient of the good society as well as being axiomatic to the
production of other individual good]{.underline}s (most directly,
liberty). It is our contention that [security can be rethought along
these lines, and that the state through its ordering and cultural work
continues to possess a central place in the production of security thus
conceived;]{.underline} we develop this argument in part II. We must
first, however, consider one further critique of the modern state
tradition.

### 2AC Perm -- Ontology 

**Prioritizing ontology is useless and the aff is not an opportunity
cost -- the perm's combination solves**

**Deudney '13** (Daniel, Associate Professor and Director of
Undergraduate Studies in Political Science @ Johns Hopkins, "Mixed
Ontology, Planetary Geopolitics, and Republican Greenpeace," November
2013, http://www.theory-talks.org/2013/11/theory-talk-60_9211.html)

In many parts of both European and American IR and related areas,
Postmodern and constructivist theories have significantly contributed to
IR theorists by enhancing our appreciation of ideas, language, and
identities in politics. As a response to the limits and blindnesses of
certain types of rationalist, structuralist, and functional theories,
this renewed interest in the ideational is an important advance.
Unfortunately, both postmodernism and constructivism have been marked by
a strong tendency to go too far in their emphasis of the ideational.
[Postmodernism and constructivism have also helped make theorists much
more conscious of the implicit---and often severely
limiting---ontological assumptions that underlay, inform, and bound
their investigations. This is also a major contribution to the study of
world politics in all its aspects. Unfortunately, this turn to ontology
has also had **intellectually limiting effects by going too far**, in
the search for a pure or nearly pure social ontology. With the growth in
these two approaches, there has indeed been a decided **decline in
theorizing about the material. But** elsewhere in the diverse world of
theorizing about IR and the global, theorizing about the material never
came anything close to disappearing or being eclipsed. For anyone
thinking about the relationships between **politics and nuclear weapons,
space, and the** **environment**, theorizing about the material has
remained at the center, and it would be **difficult to even conceive of
how** theorizing about **the material could** largely
**disappear**]{.underline}. The recent 're-discovery of the material'
associated with various self-styled 'new materialists' is a welcome, if
belated, re-discovery for postmodernists and constructivists. For most
of the rest of us, the material had never been largely dropped out. A
very visible example of the ways in which the decline in appropriate
attention to the material, an excessive turn to the ideational, and the
quest for a nearly pure social ontology, can lead theorizing astray is
the core argument in Alexander Wendt's main book, Social Theory of
International Politics, one of the widely recognized landmarks of
constructivist IR theory. The first part of the book advances a very
carefully wrought and sophisticated argument for a nearly pure
ideational social ontology. The material is explicitly displaced into a
residue or rump of unimportance. But then, to the reader's surprise, the
material, in the form of 'common fate' produced by nuclear weapons, and
climate change, reappears and is deployed to play a really crucial role
in understanding contemporary change in world politics. My solution is
to employ a mixed ontology. By this I mean that I think several
[ontologically incommensurate and very different realities are
**inescapable** parts the human world. These 'unlikes' are inescapable
parts of any argument, and **must somehow be combined.** There are a
vast number of ways in which they can be combined, and on close
examination**, virtually all arguments** in the social sciences are
actually employing some version of a **mixed ontology,** however
implicitly and **under-acknowledged.**]{.underline} But not all
combinations are equally useful in addressing all questions. In my
version of mixed ontology---which I call 'practical naturalism'---human
social agency is understood to be occurring 'between two natures': on
the one hand the largely fixed nature of humans, and on the other the
changing nature composed of the material world, a shifting amalgam of
actual non-human material nature of geography and ecology, along with
human artifacts and infrastructures. Within this frame, I posit as
rooted in human biological nature, a set of 'natural needs,' most
notably for security-from-violence and habitat services. Then I pose
questions of functionality, by which I mean: which combinations of
material practices, political structures, ideas and identities are
needed to achieve these ends in different material contexts? Answering
this question requires the formulation of various 'historical
materialist' propositions, which in turn entails the systematic
formulation of typologies and variation in both the practices,
structures and ideas, and in material contexts. [These arguments are not
centered on explaining what has or what will happen. Instead they are
practical in the sense that they are attempting to answer the question
of **'what is to be done'** given the fixed ends and given changing
material contexts]{.underline}. I think [this is what advocates of arms
control and environmental sustainability are actually doing when they
claim that one set of material practices and their attendant political
structures, identities and ideas must be replaced with another if
**basic human needs** are to going to continue to be meet in the
contemporary planetary material situation created by the globalization
of machine civilization on earth.]{.underline} [Since this set of
arguments is framed within a mixed ontology, ideas and identities are a
vital part of the research agenda. Much of the energy of]{.underline}
postmodern and many varieties of [critical theory have focused on
**'deconstructing'** various identities and ideas]{.underline}. This
critical activity has produced and continues to produce many insights of
theorizing about politics. [But I think there is an un-tapped potential
for theorists who are interested in ideas and identities, and who want
their work to make a positive contribution to **practical
problem-solving** in the contemporary planetary human situation in what
might be termed a 'constructive constructivism'.]{.underline} [This
concerns a]{.underline} large **[practical theory
agenda]{.underline}**---[and an urgent one at that, given the rapid
increase in planetary problems]{.underline}---revolving around the task
of figuring out which ideas and identities are appropriate for the
planetary world, and in figuring out how they can be rapidly
disseminated.

### 2AC Perm -- Pragmatism

#### Perm do both - Our method of opinion forming an advocacy of particular response to particular problems is a useful template for pragmatically solving transnational problems, without prescribing a formula for all decision-making---eschews state-centrism and outweighs co-option risks

**Bray** '**09**, (Daniel, The University of Melbourne International
Politics and Political Theory Lecturer, Ph.D, "Pragmatic
Cosmopolitanism: A Deweyan Approach to Democracy beyond the
Nation-State", Millennium, 37.3)

[In keeping with pragmatist tenets, my approach to the
problem]{.underline} of practical institutionalisation [is a
context-sensitive]{.underline} [one that does not impose an a priori
'direct]{.underline}' or 'representative' [template for the political
institutionalisation of democracy]{.underline}, [which may require more
or less degrees of mediation]{.underline} and delegation depending [on
the particular problematic situation]{.underline}. As Saward points out,
[different]{.underline} democratic [mechanisms may be called for
depending on whether they require permanent]{.underline} structures [or
temporary measures]{.underline} and on [whether they are undertaken
by]{.underline} [governments or by non-governmental
actors]{.underline}.103 Thus, [one may have a normative preference for
minimising]{.underline} the degree of mediation and delegation in [any
democratic regime]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} these
[features]{.underline} of democratic practice [should not be viewed as
inherent bads]{.underline}. Indeed, [given the scale and complexity of
modern politics, transnational democratic publics are likely to require
significant levels of mediation]{.underline} and delegation [if they are
to be effective actors in global politics]{.underline}.

[The key response]{.underline} of pragmatic cosmopolitanism here [is to
see]{.underline} transnational [publics as institutions of critical
inquiry that are formed when]{.underline} associated [individuals work
collectively to address problems presented by transnational
consequences]{.underline}. As Molly Cochran points out, in Deweyan terms
these publics exist on a continuum from 'weak' publics that are
understood to involve associated activity that is only informally
organised (like a neighbourhood group) or narrowly focused on a single
issue (like the control and prevention of AIDS104), to stronger publics
that have political agencies invested with public authority that are
capable of issuing binding decisions for a societal group (an
international regime, say, or a more densely articulated public we
commonly regard as a political 'state').105 [Today, in the absence of
adequately responsive global institutions, most transnational
associations take contestation]{.underline} rather than popular control
as [their fundamental political purpose]{.underline}.106 [When they seek
to provide alternative sites for deliberation where dominators are not
present they form]{.underline} what Nancy Fraser calls '[subaltern
counterpublics']{.underline} that attempt to indirectly influence formal
organisations by mobilising broader public opinion.107 [These
oppositional networks and movements can only be conceived]{.underline}
as transnational public institutions, however, [when their efforts are
directed at shifting authority away from states]{.underline} and their
agents [by making their own concerns authoritative in the decisionmaking
that takes place where]{.underline} international [public authority
exists in global politics]{.underline} -- [international law,
regimes]{.underline}, the United Nations and in the broader bilateral
and multilateral relations between states.108 [In the view of pragmatic
cosmopolitanism, this process constitutes the core dynamic of democratic
reconstruction in international institutions]{.underline}.

It is this perspective that highlights the key difference between the
pragmatist and deliberative approaches to the institutionalisation of
transnational democracy. [Instead of seeing publics as constituted by
responsible citizens who reason]{.underline} publicly on the basis of a
distinctive form of communication, [pragmatists see responsible action
as emerging from publics constituted by persons who recognise a need for
social cooperation in resolving common problematic
situations]{.underline}. In the pragmatist view, publics are developing
'the traits of a state' when they develop strong organisational and
decision-making capabilities and seek to make their concerns
authoritative in global politics. [Pragmatism therefore does not hold to
the strict state--civil society separation]{.underline} that
fundamentally shapes the deliberative approach. Beyond nation-states
with sharply defined constitutional structures, the [desire to maintain
a strict separation between opinion-formation in the public sphere and
will-formation in formal representative institutions seems to neglect
the requirement for some kind of connective tissue between
them]{.underline}, or at least [assumes that the translation of opinions
into decision-making will occur through an underlying]{.underline}
discursive [shift that changes the context in which formal decisions are
reached]{.underline}. Deliberative [democrats]{.underline} thus
[privilege informal procedures of truth-seeking]{.underline} (that are
never power-free or completely non-strategic) [over]{.underline}
political voice in [formal institutions]{.underline}. [Dryzek is
obviously concerned about]{.underline} the [co-option of oppositional
civil society]{.underline} -- which is certainly an ever-present threat
and one to be taken seriously -- [but in]{.underline} many global and
[transnational contexts this threat tends to be overstated and fails to
acknowledge the strategic character of 'publics'
themselves]{.underline}. As Cochran points out, [despite the blurring of
the state--society divide, co-option is unlikely to be ever fixed or
complete.]{.underline}109 Additionally, not all weak publics seek
permanent or even minimal levels of inclusion in existing formal
institutions, preferring to focus on contestation or developing
alternative forums. Ultimately, [pragmatic cosmopolitanism argues that
in many contexts of contemporary global politics the need to realise
change through access to formal decision-making outweighs the risk of
co-option]{.underline}. One such context I discussed earlier centres on
the contemporary climate change negotiations, where a wide variety of
[nongovernmental actors]{.underline} attempt to [influence
states]{.underline} in formal institutions [by 'channelling up' the
concerns of excluded publics]{.underline}, [while at the same time
monitoring the negotiations and 'channelling down'
information]{.underline} to broader transnational and domestic
constituencies.110

### 2AC Perm -- Disarm

[By far the greatest harm military regimes inflict on Third World
countries lies in the undermining and corruption of democratic develop-
ment and in violation of basic human rights. The creative energy of
young nations is suppressed at the very start of sovereignty and
nationhood. The experience of the Latin American countries where the
military has long since won a strong foothold should serve as a warning
here. For the international community, such a development is not only a
tragedy in human terms but a real stumbling block for global progressive
change]{.underline}. 3.4. Combating militarism Considering the size of
the problem, we will see that a strategy to combat militarism and
militarization must encompass a wide range of actions, national and
international. There is a systemic, social, political, economic, and
human rights context to such a strategy. [To be effective, it would have
to focus on the human being and human values, and of crucial importance
is the activation of public opinion. Without going into details, we may
note that a general list of steps to undertake and fields to cover would
include: a) Conceptual clarification of the terms and scope of
contemporary militarism and militarization. This calls for critical
interdisciplinary research on the organization, behavior, attitudes,
role in state and international impact of the military. Both case
studies and research on international linkages are important. A good
mapping of military regimes and the extent of militarization in the
international community would be most helpful. b) In-depth study an
analysis of the interrelation between militarism dynamics and armament
dynamics. A better comprehension of these issues is basic for devising
ways and means for a succesful anti-militaristic strategy. In the final
instance, disarmament should be one of the most effective ways to combat
militarism. c) In-depth study of the interrelation between militarism
dynamics and problems of develop- ment in the Third World. There is a
need to make the interrelation clearer, and to develop intellectual
tools for a fundamental critique of military regimes in developing
countries. d) Most of all, together with studies to broaden our
knowledge and understanding of the phenomena of militarism and
militarization,]{.underline} we need a world-wide educational campaign
which can shed light on the essence and consequences of militarism, and
aiming actively to engage broad strata of citizens all over the world
against the evil of military rule. A coalition of concerned
organizations - political, religious, and professional - is urgently
needed to undertake this

### 2AC Perm -- Militarism 

#### Radical rejection fails - the plan's the most pragmatic check on militarism

**Bacevich '13** (Andrew, Professor of History and International
Relations at Boston University and Ph.D. in American Diplomatic History
from Princeton University, The New American Militarism, p. 205-210)

There is, wrote H. L. Mencken, "always a well-known solution to every
human problem---neat, plausible, and wrong."1 Mencken's aphorism applies
in spades to the subject of this account. [To imagine]{.underline} that
there exists [a simple antidote to the "military
metaphysic"]{.underline} to which the people and government of the
United States have fallen prey [is to misconstrue the
problem]{.underline}. As the foregoing chapters make plain, the origins
of America's present-day infatuation with military power are anything
but simple. American [militarism is not]{.underline} the invention of a
cabal nursing [fantasies]{.underline} of global empire [and]{.underline}
manipulating an unsuspecting people [frightened]{.underline} by the
events of 9/11. Further, [it is counterproductive to think in these
terms--- to assign culpability to a particular president]{.underline} or
administration and to imagine that throwing the bums out will put things
right. Yet neither does the present-day status of the United States as
sole superpower reveal an essential truth, whether positive or negative,
about the American project. [Enthusiasts]{.underline} (mostly on the
right) who interpret America's possession of unrivaled and unprecedented
armed might as proof that the United States enjoys the mandate of heaven
[are deluded. But so too are those (mostly on the left)]{.underline} who
see in the far-flung doings of today's U.S. military establishment
substantiation of Major General Smedley Butler's old chestnut that "war
is just a racket" and the American soldier "a gangster for capitalism"
sent abroad to do the bidding of Big Business or Big Oil.2 [Neither the
will of God nor the venality of Wall Street suffices to
explain]{.underline} how the United States managed to become stuck in
World War IV. Rather, the new American [militarism is a little like
pollution]{.underline}---the perhaps unintended, but foreseeable
by-product of prior choices and decisions made without taking fully into
account the full range of costs likely to be incurred. In making the
industrial revolution, the captains of American enterprise did not
consciously set out to foul the environment, but as they harnessed the
waters, crisscrossed the nation with rails, and built their mills and
refineries, negative consequences ensued. Lakes and rivers became choked
with refuse, the soil contaminated, and the air in American cities
filthy. By the time that the industrial age approached its zenith in the
middle of the twentieth century, most Americans had come to take this
for granted; a degraded environment seemed the price you had to pay in
exchange for material abundance and by extension for freedom and
opportunity. Americans might not like pollution, but there seemed to be
no choice except to put up with it. To appreciate that this was, in
fact, not the case, [Americans needed a different consciousness. This is
where the environmental movement]{.underline}, beginning more or less in
the 1960s, [made its essential contribution.]{.underline}
Environmentalists enabled Americans to see the natural world and their
relationship to that world in a different light. They argued that the
obvious deterioration in the environment was unacceptable and not at all
inevitable. [Alternatives did exist. Different policies and practices
could stanch and even reverse the damage. Purists]{.underline} in that
movement [insisted upon the primacy of environmental]{.underline} needs,
everywhere and in all cases. [Theirs was]{.underline} (and is) [a
principled position]{.underline} deserving to be heard. [To act on their
recommendations, however, would likely mean shutting down the economy,
an impractical and politically infeasible course of action.
Pragmatists]{.underline} advanced a different argument. They
[suggested]{.underline} that [it was possible to negotiate a compromise
between economic needs and environmental imperatives. This compromise
might oblige Americans to curtail certain bad habits, but it did not
require changing the fundamentals of how they lived their
lives]{.underline}. Americans could keep their cars and continue their
love affair with consumption; but at the same time they could also have
cleaner air and cleaner water. Implementing this compromise has produced
an outcome that environmental radicals (and on the other side, believers
in laissez-faire capitalism) today find unsatisfactory. In practice, it
turns out, once begun negotiations never end. Bargaining is continuous,
contentious, and deeply politicized. Participants in the process seldom
come away with everything they want. [Settling for half a loaf when you
covet the whole is inevitably frustrating. But the results are
self-evident. Environmental conditions]{.underline} in the United States
today [are palpably better than they were a half century ago. Pollution
has not been vanquished, but it has become more manageable]{.underline}.
Furthermore, the nation has achieved those improvements without imposing
on citizens undue burdens and without preventing its entrepreneurs from
innovating, creating, and turning a profit. [Restoring a semblance of
balance]{.underline} and good sense [to]{.underline} the way that
Americans think about [military power will require a similarly pragmatic
approach. Undoing all]{.underline} of the [negative effects]{.underline}
that result from having been seduced by war [may lie beyond reach, but
Americans can]{.underline} at least [make them]{.underline} more
[manageable and]{.underline} thereby [salvage their
democracy]{.underline}. In explaining the origins of the new American
militarism, this account has not sought to assign or to impute blame.
None of the protagonists in this story sat down after Vietnam and
consciously plotted to propagate perverse attitudes toward military
power any more than Andrew Carnegie or John D. Rockefeller plotted to
despoil the nineteenth-century American landscape. The clamor after
Vietnam to rebuild the American arsenal and to restore American
self-confidence, the celebration of soldierly values, the search for
ways to make force more usable: all of these came about because groups
of Americans thought that they glimpsed in the realm of military affairs
the solution to vexing problems. The soldiers who sought to rehabilitate
their profession, the intellectuals who feared that America might share
the fate of Weimar, the strategists wrestling with the implications of
nuclear weapons, the conservative Christians appalled by the apparent
collapse of traditional morality: none of these acted out of motives
that were inherently dishonorable. To the extent that we may find fault
with the results of their efforts, that fault is more appropriately
attributable to human fallibility than to malicious intent. And yet [in
the end it is not motive that matters but outcome]{.underline}. Several
decades after Vietnam, in the aftermath of a century filled to
overflowing with evidence pointing to the limited utility of armed force
and the dangers inherent in relying excessively on military power, the
American people have persuaded themselves that their best prospect for
safety and salvation lies with the sword. Told that despite all of their
past martial exertions, treasure expended, and lives sacrificed, the
world they inhabit is today more dangerous than ever and that they must
redouble those exertions, they dutifully assent. Much as dumping raw
sewage into American lakes and streams was once deemed unremarkable, so
today "global power projection"---a phrase whose sharp edges we have
worn down through casual use, but which implies military activism
without apparent limit---has become standard practice, a normal
condition, one to which no plausible alternatives seem to exist. All of
this Americans have come to take for granted: it's who we are and what
we do. Such a definition of normalcy cries out for a close and critical
reexamination. Surely, the surprises, disappointments, painful losses,
and woeful, even shameful failures of the Iraq War make clear the need
to rethink the fundamentals of U.S. military policy. Yet a meaningful
reexamination will require first a change of consciousness, seeing war
and America's relationship to war in a fundamentally different way. Of
course, [dissenting views]{.underline} already exist. A rich tradition
of American pacifism abhors the resort to violence as always and in
every case wrong. Advocates of disarmament argue that by their very
existence weapons are an incitement to violence. In the former camp,
there can never be a justification for war. In the latter camp, the
shortest road to peace begins with the beating of swords into
ploughshares. These are principled views that [deserve a
hearing]{.underline}, more so today than ever. By discomfiting the
majority, advocates of such views serve the common good. [But to make
full-fledged pacifism or comprehensive disarmament the basis for policy
in an intrinsically disordered world would be to open the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to grave danger. The critique
proposed here---offering not a panacea but the prospect of causing
present-day militaristic tendencies to abate---rests on]{.underline} ten
[fundamental principles.]{.underline}

## 2AC Impact Framing 

### 2AC AT Endless War 

**No risk of endless warfare**

**Gray '07** (Colin, Director of the Centre for Strategic Studies and
Professor of International Relations and Strategic Studies at the
University of Reading, graduate of the Universities of Manchester and
Oxford, Founder and Senior Associate to the National Institute for
Public Policy, formerly with the International Institute for Strategic
Studies and the Hudson Institute, "The Implications of Preemptive and
Preventive War Doctrines: A Reconsideration," July 2007,
<http://www.ciaonet.org/wps/ssi10561/ssi10561.pdf>)

7\. A policy that favors preventive warfare expresses a futile quest for
absolute security. It could do so. Most controversial policies contain
within them the possibility of misuse. [In the hands of a
paranoid ]{.underline}or boundlessly ambitious [political leader,
prevention could be a policy for endless warfare. However, the American
political system, with its checks and balances, was designed explicitly
for the purpose of constraining the executive
from ]{.underline}excessive [folly. Both the Vietnam and the
contemporary Iraqi experiences reveal clearly
that ]{.underline}although [the conduct of war is]{.underline} an
executive prerogative, in practice that authority is [disciplined by
public attitudes]{.underline}. Clausewitz made this point superbly with
his designation of the passion, the sentiments, of the people as a vital
component of his trinitarian theory of war. 51 It is true to claim that
power can be, and indeed is often, abused, both personally and
nationally. It is possible that a state could acquire a taste for the
apparent swift decisiveness of preventive warfare and overuse the
option. One might argue that the easy success achieved against Taliban
Afghanistan in 2001, provided fuel for the urge to seek a similarly
rapid success against Saddam Hussein's Iraq. In other words, the
delights of military success can be habit forming. On balance, claim
seven is not persuasive, though it certainly contains a germ of truth. A
country with unmatched wealth and power, unused to physical insecurity
at home---notwithstanding 42 years of nuclear danger, and a high level
of gun crime---is vulnerable to demands for policies that supposedly can
restore security. But[ we ought not to endorse the argument]{.underline}
that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should eschew the
preventive war option because it could lead to a futile, endless search
for absolute security. One might as well argue that]{.underline} the
United States should adopt a defense policy and develop capabilities
shaped strictly for homeland security approached in a narrowly
geographical sense. [Since a president might misuse a military
instrument that had a global reach, why not deny the White House even
the possibility of such misuse? In other words, constrain policy ends by
limiting policy's military means. ]{.underline}This argument has
circulated for many decades and, it must be admitted, it does have a
certain elementary logic. It is the opinion of this enquiry, however,
that [the claim that a policy which includes the preventive option might
lead to **a search for total security is not at all
convincing**]{.underline}. Of course, folly in high places is always
possible, which is one of the many reasons why popular democracy is the
superior form of government[. It would be absurd to permit the fear of a
futile and dangerous quest for absolute security to preclude prevention
as a policy option. Despite its absurdity, this rhetorical charge
against prevention is a stock favorite among prevention's critics. It
should be recognized and dismissed for what it is, a debating point with
little pragmatic merit. And strategy,]{.underline} though not always
policy, [**must be nothing if not pragmatic**.]{.underline}

### 2AC AT Endless War

#### No endless war -- the public checks and no budget

**Ben Ami** **'11** (Shlomo, VP of Toledo International Centre for
Peace, July 1, "Arab Spring, Western Fall" Project Syndicate,
http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/benami55/English)

The old vocation of what Rudyard Kipling called the "White Man's Burden"
-- [the driving idea behind the West's quest for global hegemony from
the days of imperial expansion]{.underline} in the nineteenth century to
the current, pathetically inconclusive, Libyan intervention -- [has
clearly **run out of steam**]{.underline}. [**Politically and
economically exhausted**, and attentive to electorates clamoring for a
shift of priorities to urgent domestic concerns, Europe and America are
**no longer very capable of imposing their values and interests**
through costly military interventions in faraway lands]{.underline}. US
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates was stating the obvious when he
recently lambasted NATO's European members for their lukewarm response
to the alliance's missions, and for their poor military capabilities.
(Ten weeks into the fighting in Libya, the Europeans were already
running out of munitions.) He warned that if Europe's attitude to NATO
did not change, the Alliance would degenerate into "collective military
irrelevance." Europe's reluctance to participate in military endeavors
should not come as a revelation. The Old Continent has been immersed
since World War II in a "post-historical" discourse that rules out the
use of force as a way to resolve conflicts, let alone to bring about
regime change. And now it is engaged in a fateful struggle to secure the
very existence and viability of the European Union. As a result, Europe
is retreating into a narrow regional outlook -- and assuming that
America will carry the burden of major global issues. But
[America]{.underline} itself [is reconsidering its priorities. These are
trying economic times for the US]{.underline}, largely [owing to
imperial overstretch financed by Chinese credit]{.underline}. Admiral
Mike Mullen, the US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently
defined America's colossal fiscal deficits as the biggest threat to its
national security. Indeed, at a time of painful budget cuts -- the US is
facing a \$52 trillion shortfall on public pensions and health care in
the coming decades -- the US can no longer be expected to maintain its
current level of global military engagement. But the fiscal crisis is
not the whole story. [The dire lessons of]{.underline} the wars in [Iraq
and Afghanistan will shape future debate about America's international
role]{.underline} in the twenty-first century. At an address in February
to cadets at the US Military Academy at West Point, Gates said that
"[any future defense secretary who advises the president to send a big
American land army into]{.underline} Asia or into [the Middle East or
Africa should have his head examined]{.underline}." Gates's recent
statements are by no means those of a lonely isolationist in an
otherwise interventionist America. He expressed a widely perceived
imperative for strategic reassessment. In 1947, in a landmark article,
"The Sources of Soviet Conduct," which he signed as "X," George Kennan
defined America's foreign-policy strategy for the Cold War as one of
containment and deterrence. It is difficult to imagine a more marked
departure from Kennan's concepts than a report recently released by the
Pentagon -- [A National Strategic Narrative]{.underline} -- authored by
two active-duty military officers who signed as "Y." The report can be
dismissed as just the musings of two senior members of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff writing in their "personal capacity." But its real power stems
from the degree to which it reflects America's mood in an era of
declining global influence and diminishing expectations regarding the
relevance of military power to sustaining US global hegemony. Just as
Kennan's "X" article was fully reflective of the mood in America at the
time, so the Narrative expresses the current American Zeitgeist. Thus,
the idea that "Y" might turn out to be a latter-day "X" -- defining the
nature of America's international role in the twenty-first century --
may not be far-fetched. Conspicuously, there is much in the Narrative
that coincides with Europe's emphasis on soft power. The authors [call
for a shift from outdated Cold War strategies of "power and control" to
one of civic engagement and sustainable prosperity. Security, they
maintain,]{.underline} means more than defense. It [means engagement
whereby America should not seek "to bully]{.underline}, intimidate,
cajole, or persuade others to accept our unique values or to share our
national objectives." [America, "Y" argues, must first put its own house
in order]{.underline} if it is to recover credible global influence as a
beacon of prosperity and justice. This would require improving America's
diplomatic capabilities, as well as regaining international
competitiveness through greater investment in education and
infrastructure at home. [The message emanating now from the US
is]{.underline} not one of non-interventionism, but **[a strategy of
restraint]{.underline}** [that assumes that there are limits to American
power and seeks to minimize the risk of entanglement in foreign
conflicts.]{.underline} As Gates put it in his West Point address, [the
US Army would **no longer be "a Victorian nation-building constabulary**
designed to chase guerrillas, build schools, or sip tea."]{.underline}

### 2AC No Root Cause 

#### No root cause of nukes or war 

**Horgan '14** (John, Director of the Center for Science Writings at
Stevens Institute of Technology, "To End War, Focus on Culture Rather
than \"Root Causes\"", Scientific American, 8-18,
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/to-end-war-focus-on-culture-rather-than-root-causes/)

When I started researching war, [I]{.underline} also [assumed that to
get rid of war, we have to get rid of its root causes. The trouble is,
scholars have identified countless causes of war. One
pseudo-explanation]{.underline} (which I\'m glad Kloor does not mention,
and which I rebut early on in my book and in posts such as this) [is
that war stems from]{.underline} a compulsion bred into our ancestors by
natural selection. [Biology]{.underline} underpins war, as it underpins
all human behaviors. The crucial question is, why does war break out in
certain places and times and not others? [The most popular
non-biological explanations]{.underline} of war [are]{.underline} what I
call [the **Malthusian** and **Marxist** hypotheses. The
first]{.underline} posits [that war stems from our tendency to
over-reproduce and hence fight over land and other resources. The second
holds that war stems from inequality, the tendency of societies
(especially capitalist ones) to divide into haves and
have-nots]{.underline}. [Scholars have]{.underline} also [blamed wars on
**religion**, **racism** and **nationalism**]{.underline}, which Kloor
mentions above, [as well as such **fundamental social traits** as
hierarchy, sexism and injustice. If you **cherry pick**, you **always
find evidence** to support your favorite theory]{.underline}. [But as
scholars]{.underline} such as Lewis Fry Richardson (whom my friend David
Berreby recently profiled) [have shown]{.underline}, neither the
Malthusian and Marxist theories **[no]{.underline}**r any of the other
**[explanations above can account for the vast diversity of
wars]{.underline}**. Moreover, [some factors that provoke
conflict]{.underline}, such as religion, [can also inhibit
it]{.underline}. Religion has inspired some of our greatest antiwar
leaders, notably Gandhi and Martin Luther King. I have found [only one
theory of war that fits the facts]{.underline}. The theory holds [that
war is a self-perpetuating, contagious meme, which can propagate
**independently of other social and environmental
factors**]{.underline}. As anthropologist Margaret Mead put it in a
famous 1940 essay, \"Warfare Is Only an Invention---Not a Biological
Necessity.\" In other words, the major cause of war is war itself, which
has a terrible tendency to spread even to societies that would prefer to
remain peaceful. I make this point in my book and in a 2010 blog post,
\"Margaret Mead's war theory kicks butt of neo-Darwinian and Malthusian
models.\" Here is an edited excerpt: In his 1997 book War Before
Civilization, anthropologist Lawrence Keeley notes that war among North
American Indians often stemmed from the aggression of just a few
extremely warlike tribes, \"rotten apples that spoiled their regional
barrels.\" He added, \"Less aggressive societies, stimulated by more
warlike groups in their vicinity, become more bellicose themselves.\"
Societies in a violent region, the political scientist Azar Gat
emphasizes in his 2006 book War in Human Civilization, have a strong
incentive to carry out preemptive attacks. Societies may \"attack the
other side in order to eliminate or severely weaken them as a potential
enemy. Indeed, this option only makes the other side more insecure,
rendering the security dilemma more acute. War can thus become a
self-fulfilling prophecy. The fear of war breeds war.\" [Many people are
**pessimistic** about ending war because they assume it will require
**radical social engineering**. World peace will require eliminating
poverty, inequality, sexism, **racism** or **\[fill in the
blank\]**.]{.underline} We will need to eradicate religion, or all
embrace the same religion. We will need to get rid of all nation states
and become anarchists, or form a single global government. [My
analysis]{.underline} of war [suggests that if we want to end war, **we
don\'t need to create a society radically different** from our own, let
alone a utopia. If we want to end war, we should focus on ending
war]{.underline} and the culture of war [rather than on **supposed
causal factors**. If we can do that, we will **take a major step toward
solving many**]{.underline} of our **[other social
problems]{.underline}**, as I argued in my previous post. And that
brings me to Keith Kloor\'s final challenge to me. He devotes much of
his column to a discussion of how extremists on both sides of the
conflict between Israel and Palestine have \"hijacked the peace process.
Horrific spasmodic cycles of violence and death is the result.\" He asks
me how we can \"rid the world of extremist groups that sow the seeds of
war.\" [Kloor has]{.underline} his [**causation backwards**. Just as war
promotes poverty, tyranny, inequality and resource depletion **at least
as much as vice versa**]{.underline}, so war promotes fanaticism. Once
militarism seizes hold of a society, it can transform vast populations
into virtual sociopaths. It turns decent, ethical, reasonable people
into intolerant fanatics capable of the most heinous acts. [Breaking out
of]{.underline} what Kloor calls \"spasmodic [cycles of
violence]{.underline} and death\" [can be]{.underline} extraordinarily
[difficult, but history offers many examples of societies that have done
just that. Germany and France were bitter, bloody rivals for centuries.
But it is now inconceivable that Germany and France]{.underline}---or
any members of the European Union\--[would go to war]{.underline}
against each other. [One of my favorite examples of a nation that has
renounced militarism is Costa Rica]{.underline}. Like many of its
neighbors in Central American, Costa was once wracked by terrible
violence. But [after a bloody civil war in the 1940s, Costa Rica
disbanded its army]{.underline}, freeing up more funds for education,
health care, transportation and tourism. It is often ranked as one of
the most peaceful, healthy, \"happy\" nations in the world.

### 2AC No Root Cause 

#### Root cause logic is [reductive]{.underline}---it [subverts]{.underline} change

**Morson '07** (Gary, Professor of Slavic Studies, Russian Literature
and History at Northwestern, "Anna Karenina In Our Time: Seeing More
Wisely," P. 152-4)

If Levin resembled so may **[intellectuals]{.underline}** in his time
and ours, he might **[seek "root cause"]{.underline}** (as we would call
it today) of all these failures. Much as the generals an historians
satirized in War and Peace mistakenly seek the cause of historical
events in a single decision, an much as
**[revolutionaries]{.underline}** often **[reduce the complexities of
social ills to a single]{.underline}** **[conspiracy or
institution]{.underline}**, so [intellectuals]{.underline} often [view
complexity as a delusion to be explained away by a few simple underlying
laws. It is just this habit of thought that feeds utopianism, because if
the diversity of evil an misery had a single cause, then one could
eliminate it by changing only one thing What could be easier? Abolish
private property]{.underline}, alter the way children are educated, pass
laws to regulate morals according to a given code, **[and evil will
disappear]{.underline}** or, at least, radically diminish. Behold, I
make all new things But Levin learns that there is no single cause for
what has gone wrong. [Looking back on the twentieth
century]{.underline}, we may wonder whether **[the root cause of the
worst human misery is the belief that there is a root cause of human
misery.]{.underline}** In fact, many things happen contingently, just
"for some reason."¶ Friction¶ When l.evin attends the elections, he
tries to handle some business for his sister, but discovers that somehow
it cannot be done. In Dostoevsky, the reason would be \"administrative
ecstasy,\" the sheer delight bureaucrats take in making petitioners
cringe, plead, or wait. But nothing of the sort happens here, and the
problem is not one of intent at all. No one has any interest in
thwarting Levin, so he cannot understand what goes wrong.¶ When
conspiracy theorists find they cannot accomplish something as easily as
expected, they typically ask cut bono? (who benefits?) ro discover the
obstacle. Some person or group must have caused the failure. Defeat
means sabotage. This way of thinking presumes that behind every action
there must be an intent,¶ whether conscious or unconscious. Such a view
rules out the possibility that mere contingency or friction accounts for
the difficulty.¶ flic military theorist Carl von Clauscwitz deemed
friction, in this special metaphorical sense, an essential concept in
understanding armies. Without using this word, Tolstoy regarded the same
phenomenon as pertaining not just to war but to everything social. \"If
one has never personally experienced war,\" Clauscwitz explains,¶ one
cannot understand in what difficulties constantly mentioned really
consist. . . . Everything looks simple; the knowledge required docs not
look remarkable, the strategic options are so obvious that by comparison
the simplest problem of higher mathematics has an impressive scientific
dignity. Once war has actually been seen the difficulties become clear;
but it is extremely difficult to describe the unseen, all-pervading
element that brings about this change of perspective. Everything in war
is very simple, but the simplest thing is difficult. \'Die difficulties
accumulate and end by producing a kind of friction that is inconceivable
unless one has experienced war. (Clausewitz, 119)¶ The unseen,
all-pervading element: For Tolstoy, similar difficulties arise when
dealing with bureaucracy, introducing changes in agriculture, and
implementing reforms. A Tolstoyan perspective is easily imagined today.
Social problems look so simple: people in underdeveloped countries are
poor, so give their governments foreign aid; workers arc unemployed, so
hire them to perform needed government services; schools do not educate,
so raise teachers\' salaries; the state regulatory commission keeps
energy prices too high, so partially privatize the system: answers seem
so obvious, but in practice reforms rarely have the intended effect.
They produce unintended consequences, which themselves have
consequences; and, as Isaiah Berlin liked to point our, no one can
foresee the consequences of consequences of consequences. Experience may
teach one to expect certain kinds of difficulties, but some can never be
anticipated, lhcrc is always friction: \"Countless minor incidents
---the kind you can never really foresee---combine to lower the general
level of performance, so that one always falls far short of the intended
goal\" (Clauscwitz, 119).¶ No one is deliberately impeding Levin\'s
efforts for his sister. By the same token, no one is trying to thwart
his agricultural reforms. Sabotage is out of the question. \"All this
happened not because anyone felt ill will toward Levin or his farm; on
the contrary, he knew that they \[rhe peasants\] liked him \[and\]
thought him a simple gentleman (their highest praise)\" (340).¶ Friction
defeats the reforms. But where does this friction come from and how
might one best deal with it?¶ TTic Elemental Force¶ \'Ihe bailiff and
peasants recognize in advance when a plan is bound to fail, and at lasr
l.evin, instead of growing angry, pays artention to what they say:¶ The
bailiff listened attentively, and obviously made an effort to approve of
his employer\'s projects. But still he had that look Levin knew so well
that always irritated him, a look of hopelessness and despondency. That
look said: \" Ihat\'s all very well, but as God wills.\" Nothing
mortified Levin so much as that tone. But it was common to all the
bailiffs he had ever had. They had all taken up that attitude toward his
plans, and so now he was not angered by it but mortified, and felr all
the more roused ro struggle against this, as it seemed, elemental force
continually ranged against him, for which he could find no other
expression than \"as God wills.\" (165)¶ Ihe elementalforce: this
concept is central to both Tolstoy\'s great novels. Tolstoy uses a few
similar terms for it. In War and Peace, he refers to an elemental force
shaping individual lives (W&P, 648) and to \"the elemental life of the
swarm\" constituting the cumulative effect of countless people\'s small
actions governed by no overarching law. In Anna Karentna, he calls the
elemental force a \"brutal force\" when its outcome is cruel. Ihe rough
equivalent of friction for Clause-witz, the elemental force applies more
widely.¶ Clauscwitz\'s explanation stops at friction, but Tolstoy takes
the elemental force as a starting point for understanding why some plans

### 2AC Predictions Inevitable 

#### Policymakers will inevitably make predictions -- failure to use explicit risk calculation causes poor decision-making

**Fitzsimmons '07** (Michael, Winter, Defence Analyst**,** "The Problem
of Uncertainty in Strategic Planning" Survival)

In defence of prediction Uncertainty is not a new phenomenon for
strategists. Clausewitz knew that 'many intelligence reports in war are
contradictory; even more are false, and most are uncertain'. In coping
with uncertainty, he believed that 'what one can reasonably ask of an
officer is that he should possess a standard of judgment, which he can
gain only from knowledge of men and affairs and from common sense. He
should be guided by the laws of probability.'34 Granted, one can
certainly allow for epistemological debates about the best ways of
gaining 'a standard of judgment' from 'knowledge of men and affairs and
from common sense'. Scientific inquiry into the 'laws of probability'
for any given strate- gic question may not always be possible or
appropriate. Certainly, analysis cannot and should not be presumed to
trump the intuition of decision-makers. Nevertheless, Clausewitz's
implication seems to be that [the burden of proof in any debates about
planning should belong to the decision-maker who rejects formal
analysis, standards of evidence and probabilistic
reasoning]{.underline}. Ultimately, though, [the value of prediction in
strategic planning does not rest primarily in getting the correct
answer]{.underline}, or even in the more feasible objective of bounding
the range of correct answers. Rather, [prediction requires decision-
makers to expose, not only to others but to themselves, the beliefs they
hold regarding why a given event is likely or unlikely and why it would
be important or unimportant]{.underline}. Richard Neustadt and Ernest
May highlight this useful property of probabilistic reasoning in their
renowned study of the use of history in decision-making, Thinking in
Time. In discussing the importance of probing presumptions, they
contend: The need is for tests prompting questions, for sharp,
straightforward mechanisms the decision makers and their aides might
readily recall and use to dig into their own and each others'
presumptions. And they need tests that get at basics somewhat by
indirection, not by frontal inquiry: not 'what is your inferred
causation, General?' Above all, not, 'what are your values, Mr.
Secretary?' \... If someone says 'a fair chance' \... ask, 'if you were
a betting man or woman, what odds would you put on that?' If others are
present, ask the same of each, and of yourself, too. Then probe the
differences: why? This is tantamount to seeking and then arguing
assumptions underlying different numbers placed on a subjective
probability assessment. We know of no better way to force clarification
of meanings while exposing hidden differences \... Once differing odds
have been quoted, the question 'why?' can follow any number of tracks.
Argument may pit common sense against common sense or analogy against
analogy. What is important is that the expert's basis for linking 'if'
with 'then' gets exposed to the hearing of other experts before the lay
official has to say yes or no.'35 There are at least three critical and
related benefits of prediction in strate- gic planning. The first
reflects Neustadt and May's point -- [prediction enforces a certain
level of discipline in making explicit the assumptions, key variables
and implied causal relationships that constitute decision-makers'
beliefs and that might otherwise remain implicit]{.underline}.
[Imagine,]{.underline} for example, [if Shinseki and Wolfowitz had been
made to assign probabilities to their opposing expectations regarding
post-war Iraq. Not only would they have had to work harder to justify
their views, they might have seen more clearly the substantial chance
that they were wrong and had to make greater efforts in their planning
to prepare for that contingency]{.underline}. [Secondly, the very
process of making the relevant factors of a decision explicit provides a
firm]{.underline}, or at least transparent[, basis for making
choices.]{.underline} Alternative courses of action can be compared and
assessed in like terms. [Third, the transparency and discipline of the
process of arriving at the initial strategy should heighten the
decision-maker's sensitivity toward changes in the environment that
would suggest the need for adjustments to that strategy]{.underline}.
[In this way, prediction enhances rather than under-mines strategic
flexibility]{.underline}. This defence of prediction does not imply that
great stakes should be gambled on narrow, singular predictions of the
future. On the contrary, the central problem of uncertainty in plan-
ning remains that any given prediction may simply be wrong. Preparations
for those eventualities must be made. Indeed, in many cases, relatively
unlikely outcomes could be enormously consequential, and therefore merit
extensive preparation and investment. In order to navigate this
complexity, strategists must return to the dis- tinction between
uncertainty and risk. [While the complexity of the international
security environment may make it somewhat resistant to the type of
probabilistic thinking associated with risk, a risk-oriented approach
seems to be the only viable model for national-security strategic
planning. The alternative approach]{.underline}, which categorically
denies prediction[, precludes strategy]{.underline}. As Betts argues,
Any assumption that some knowledge, whether intuitive or explicitly
formalized, provides guidance about what should be done is a presumption
that there is reason to believe the choice will produce a satisfactory
outcome -- that is, it is a prediction, however rough it may be. If
there is no hope of discerning and manipulating causes to produce
intended effects, analysts as well as politicians and generals should
all quit and go fishing.36 Unless they are willing to quit and go
fishing, then, strategists must sharpen their tools of risk assessment.
Risk assessment comes in many varieties, but identification of two key
parameters is common to all of them: the consequences of a harmful event
or condition; and the likelihood of that harmful event or condition
occurring. With no perspective on likelihood, a strategist can have no
firm perspective on risk. With no firm perspective on risk, strategists
cannot purposefully discriminate among alternative choices. Without
purposeful choice, there is no strategy. \* \* \* One of the most widely
read books in recent years on the complicated relation- ship between
strategy and uncertainty is Peter Schwartz's work on scenario-based
planning, The Art of the Long View. Schwartz warns against the hazards
faced by leaders who have deterministic habits of mind, or who deny the
difficult implications of uncertainty for strategic planning. To
overcome such tenden- cies, he advocates the use of alternative future
scenarios for the purposes of examining alternative strategies. His view
of scenarios is that their goal is not to predict the future, but to
sensitise leaders to the highly contingent nature of their
decision-making.37 This philosophy has taken root in the
strategic-planning processes in the Pentagon and other parts of the US
government, and properly so. Examination of alternative futures and the
potential effects of surprise on current plans is essential.
Appreciation of uncertainty also has a number of organisational impli-
cations, many of which the national-security establishment is trying to
take to heart, such as encouraging multidisciplinary study and training,
enhancing information sharing, rewarding innovation, and placing a
premium on speed and versatility. The arguments advanced here seek to
take nothing away from these imperatives of planning and operating in an
uncertain environment. But appreciation of uncertainty carries hazards
of its own. [Questioning assumptions is critical, but assumptions must
be made in the end.]{.underline} Clausewitz's 'standard of judgment' for
discriminating among alternatives must be applied. Creative, unbounded
speculation must resolve to choice or else there will be no strategy.
Recent history suggests that [unchecked scepticism regarding the
validity of prediction can marginalise analysis]{.underline}, trade
significant cost for ambig- uous benefit, [empower parochial interests
in decision-making, and undermine flexibility]{.underline}. Accordingly,
having fully recognised the need to broaden their strategic-planning
aperture, national-security policymakers would do well now to
reinvigorate their efforts in the messy but indispensable business of
predicting the future.

### 2AC Reps Not First

#### Reps alone can't explain action -- need a combined approach

**Tuathail '96** (Gearoid, Department of Georgraphy at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, Political Geography, 15(6-7), p. 664, science
direct)

[While theoretical debates at academic conferences are important to
academics, the discourse and concerns of foreign-policy decision- makers
are quite different, so different that they constitute a
distinctive]{.underline} problem- solving, theory-averse, [policy-making
subculture. There is a danger that academics assume that the discourses
they engage are more significant in the practice of foreign policy and
the exercise of power than they really are]{.underline}. This is not,
however, to minimize the obvious importance of academia as a general
institutional structure among many that sustain certain epistemic
communities in particular states. In general, I do not disagree with
[Dalby's]{.underline} fourth point about politics and discourse except
to note that his [statement-'Precisely because reality could be
represented in particular ways]{.underline} political decisions could be
taken, troops and material moved and war fought'-[evades the important
question of agency]{.underline} that I noted in my review essay. [The
assumption that it is representations that make action possible is
**inadequate by itself**. Political, military and economic structures,
institutions, discursive networks and leadership are all crucial in
explaining social action and should be theorized together with
representational practices]{.underline}. Both here and earlier, Dalby's
reasoning inclines towards a form of idealism. In response to Dalby's
fifth point (with its three subpoints), it is worth noting, first, that
his book is about the CPD, not the Reagan administration. He analyzes
certain CPD discourses, root the geographical reasoning practices of the
Reagan administration nor its public-policy reasoning on national
security. Dalby's book is narrowly textual; the general contextuality of
the Reagan administration is not dealt with. Second, let me simply note
that I find that the distinction between critical theorists and post-
structuralists is a little too rigidly and heroically drawn by Dalby and
others. Third, Dalby's interpretation of the reconceptualization of
national security in Moscow as heavily influenced by dissident peace
researchers in Europe is highly idealist, an interpretation that ignores
the structural and ideological crises facing the Soviet elite at that
time. Gorbachev's reforms and his new security discourse were also
strongly self- interested, an ultimately futile attempt to save the
Communist Party and a discredited regime of power from disintegration.
The issues raised by Simon Dalby in his comment are important ones for
all those interested in the practice of critical geopolitics. While I
agree with Dalby that questions of discourse are extremely important
ones for political geographers to engage, [there is a danger of
fetishizing this concern with discourse so that we neglect the
institutional and the sociological, the materialist and the cultural,
the political and the geographical contexts within which particular
discursive strategies become significant.]{.underline} Critical
geopolitics, in other words, should not be a prisoner of the sweeping
ahistorical cant that sometimes accompanies 'poststructuralism nor
convenient reading strategies like the identity politics narrative; it
needs to always be open to the patterned mess that is human history.

### 2AC Reps Not First

#### Reps don't shape security policy

**Balzacq 5** (Thierry, Professor of Political Science and International
Relations at Namur University, "The Three Faces of Securitization:
Political Agency, Audience and Context" European Journal of
International Relations, London: Jun 2005, Volume 11, Issue 2)

However, despite important insights, this position remains highly
disputable. The reason behind this qualification is not hard to
understand. With great trepidation my contention is that one of the main
distinctions we need to take into account while examining securitization
is that between \'institutional\' and \'brute\' threats. In its attempts
to follow a more radical approach to security problems wherein threats
are institutional, that is, mere products of communicative relations
between agents, the CS has neglected the importance of \'external or
brute threats\', that is, [threats]{.underline} that [do not depend on
language mediation to be what they]{.underline} are - hazards for human
life. In methodological terms, however, any framework over-emphasizing
either institutional or brute threat risks losing sight of important
aspects of a multifaceted phenomenon. Indeed, securitization, as
suggested earlier, is successful when the securitizing agent and the
audience reach a common structured perception of an ominous development.
In this scheme, there is no security problem except through the language
game. Therefore, [how problems are \'out there\' is]{.underline}
exclusively [contingent upon how we linguistically depict
them]{.underline}. This [is not always true]{.underline}. For one,
[language does not construct reality; at best, it shapes]{.underline}
our [perception]{.underline} of it. Moreover, [it is not theoretically
useful nor is it empirically credible to hold that what we say about a
problem would determine its essence. For instance, what I say about a
typhoon would not change it]{.underline}s essence. The consequence of
this position, which would require a deeper articulation, is that some
security problems are the attribute of the development itself. In short,
[threats are]{.underline} not only [institutional; some]{.underline} of
them [can]{.underline} actually [wreck entire political communities
regardless of the use of language]{.underline}. Analyzing security
problems then becomes a matter of understanding how external contexts,
including [external objective developments, affect
securitization]{.underline}. Thus, far from being a departure from
constructivist approaches to security, external developments are central
to it.

### 2AC AT Structural Violence 

#### War turns structural violence

**Goldstein '01** (Joshua, Prof PoliSci @ American University, War and
Gender , P. 412)

First, peace activists face a dilemma in thinking about causes of war
and working for peace. [Many peace scholars and activists support the
approach, \"if you want peace, work for justice\".]{.underline} Then if
one believes that sexism contributes to war, one can work for gender
justice specifically (perhaps among others) in order to pursue peace.
This approach brings strategic allies to the peace movement (women,
labor, minorities), but [rests on the assumption that injustices cause
war. The evidence in this book suggests that causality runs at least as
strongly the other way. War is not a product of capitalism, imperialism,
gender, innate aggression, or any other single cause, although all of
these influences wars\' outbreaks and outcomes. Rather, war has in part
fueled and sustained these and other injustices]{.underline}. So, \"if
you want peace, work for peace.\" Indeed, **[if you want
justice]{.underline}** (gener and others), **[work for
peace]{.underline}**. Causality does not run just upward through the
levels of analysis from types of individuals, societies, and governments
up to war. It runs downward too. Enloe suggests that [changes in
attitudes toward war and the military may be the **most important way to
\"reverse women\'s oppression**]{.underline}\" The dilemma is that peace
work focused on justice brings to the peace movement energy, allies and
moral grounding, yet, in light of this book\'s evidence, the emphasis on
injustice as the main cause of war seems to be empirically inadequate.

### 2AC Util Good

**Action without regard for consequences is a [hollow
gesture]{.underline} that guarantees violence**

**Condit '15** (Celeste, PhD, Distinguished Research Professor of
Communication Studies at the University of Georgia, "Multi-Layered
Trajectories for Academic Contributions to Social Change," Quarterly
Journal of Speech, 101.1)

Thus, [when]{.underline} Žižek and [others urge us to "Act"]{.underline}
with violence [to destroy the current Reality, without a vision of an
alternative, on the grounds that the links between actions and
consequences are never certain, we can call]{.underline} his [\[the\]
appeal]{.underline} both **[a failure of imagination]{.underline}** and
a failure of reality. As for reality, [we have dozens of revolutions as
models, and the historical record indicates quite clearly that they
generally lead not to harmonious cooperation]{.underline} (what I call
"AnarchoNiceness" to gently mock the romanticism of Hardt and Negri)
[but instead to the production of **totalitarian states**]{.underline}
**[and]{.underline}**/or [**violent factional strife**.]{.underline} A
materialist constructivist epistemology accounts for this by predicting
that it is not possible for symbol-using animals to exist in a symbolic
void. [All symbolic movement has a trajectory, and if you have not
**imagined a potentially realizable alternative** for that trajectory to
take, then what people will **leap into** is biological
predispositions]{.underline}---[the first iteration of which is the rule
of the strongest]{.underline} primate. Indeed, [**this is what
experience with revolutions** has shown to be the most probable outcome
of a revolution that is **merely against an Evil**.]{.underline} [The
failure of imagination]{.underline} in such rhetorics thereby [reveals
itself to be critical]{.underline}, so it is worth pondering sources of
that failure. The rhetoric of "the kill" in social theory in the past
half century has repeatedly reduced to the leap into a void because the
symbolized alternative that the context of the twentieth century
otherwise predispositionally offers is to the binary opposite of
capitalism, i.e., communism. That rhetorical option, however, has been
foreclosed by the historical discrediting of the readily imagined forms
of communism (e.g., Žižek9). [The hard work to invent better
alternatives is not as dramatically enticing as the story of the kill:
such labor is **piecemeal**]{.underline}**, [intellectually
difficult]{.underline}**, [requires multi-disciplinary understandings,
and]{.underline} perhaps **[requires more creativity]{.underline} [than
the typical academic theorist can muster]{.underline}**. [In the absence
of a viable alternative]{.underline}, the [appeals to]{.underline}
Radical [Revolution seem to have been]{.underline} [sustained by the
emotional zing of the kill]{.underline}, in many cases amped up by the
appeal of autonomy and manliness (Žižek uses the former term and deploys
the ethos of the latter). But **[if one does not provide a viable
vision]{.underline}** that [offers a reasonable chance of leaving most
people better off than they are now, then Fox News has a better
offering]{.underline} (you\'ll be free and you\'ll get rich!). [A
**revolution posited as a void cannot succeed** as a horizon of
history]{.underline}, [other than as constant local scale violent
actions]{.underline}, perhaps connected by shifting networks we call
"terrorists." This analysis of the geo-political situation, of the
onto-epistemological character of language, and of the limitations of
the dominant horizon of social change indicates that **[the focal
project]{.underline}** [for progressive Left Academics
should]{.underline} now **[include the hard labor]{.underline} [to
produce alternative visions]{.underline}** [that appear materially
feasible**.**]{.underline}

## 2AC Offense 

### 2AC Alt Fails 

#### Case disproves the critique -- the alts normative ethical vision for IR is [unattainable]{.underline} and gets [coopted.]{.underline} Managing insecurity through the plan is better than the alt -- AND only evaluate link args if they win alt solvency 

**Chandler '13** (David, IR Prof @ University of Westminster, "No
emancipatory alternative, no critical security studies," Critical
Studies on Security, 2013 Vol. 1, No. 1, 46--63)

We would argue that the removal of the prefix 'critical' would also be
useful to distinguish security study based on critique of the world as
it exists from normative theorising based on the world as we would like
it to be. As long as we keep the 'critical' nomenclature, we are
affirming that government and international policy-making can be
understood and critiqued against the goal of emancipating the
non-Western Other[. Judging policy-making]{.underline} and policy
outcomes, [on the basis of this imputed goal]{.underline}, [may provide
'critical' theorists with endless possibilities to demonstrate
their]{.underline} [normative standpoints]{.underline} [but it does
little to develop academic and political understandings]{.underline} [of
the world we live in.]{.underline} In fact, [no greater straw
\[person\]]{.underline} man [could have been imagined]{.underline},
[than the ability to become 'critical' on the basis of debates around
the claim that the West was now capable of undertaking emancipatory
policy missions]{.underline}. Today, [as we witness a narrowing of
transformative aspirations on behalf of Western policy elites, in a
reaction against the 'hubris' of the claims of the 1990s]{.underline}
(Mayall and Soares de Oliveira 2012) [and a slimmed down approach to
sustainable, 'hybrid' peacebuilding, CSS has again renewed its
relationship with the policy sphere]{.underline}. [Some]{.underline}
[academics and policy-makers now have a united front that rather than
placing emancipation at the heart of policy-making it should be 'local
knowledge' and 'local demands'. The]{.underline} double
[irony]{.underline} of the birth and death of CSS [is not only that CSS
has come full circle]{.underline} -- [from its liberal teleological
universalist and emancipatory claims]{.underline}, in the 1990s, [to its
discourses of limits and flatter ontologies]{.underline}, highlighting
differences and pluralities in the 2010s -- but that [this 'critical'
approach to security has]{.underline} also mirrored and [mimicked the
policy discourses of leading Western powers.]{.underline} As
policy-makers now look for excuses to explain the failures of the
promise of liberal interventionism, [critical security theorists
are]{.underline} [on hand to salve Western consciences with analyses of
non-linearity]{.underline}, [complexity]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
human and non-human [assemblages]{.underline}. It appears that [the
world cannot be transformed after all.]{.underline} [We cannot end
conflict or insecurity]{.underline}, [merely attempt to manage
them]{.underline}. Once critique becomes anti-critique (Noys 2011) and
emancipatory [alternatives are seen to be merely expressions
of]{.underline} liberal [hubris]{.underline}, [the appendage of
'critical' for arguments that discount the possibility of transforming
the world and stake no claims which are unamenable to power or distinct
from dominant philosophical understandings is highly
problematic]{.underline}. Let us study security, [its discourses and its
practices, by all means but please let us not pretend that study is
somehow the same as critique.]{.underline}

### [2AC Deterrence Good]{.underline} 

#### Security is key to deterrence -- solves extinction 

**Quackenbush 10** (Stephen L, Assistant Professor, Department of
Political Science, University of Missouri, January 2010, "International
Interactions General Deterrence and International Conflict: Testing
Perfect Deterrence Theory," International Interactions, Vol. 36, No. 1,
p. 60-85)

[**Case selection** has been the biggest obstacle to the empirical
analysis of general deterrence]{.underline} (Huth 1999). The only
previous quantitative study focusing on direct general deterrence is by
Huth and Russett (1993:63, emphasis added), who argue that "the
population of enduring rivalries in the international system includes
all dyadic relations in which a dispute created the possibility of one
or both parties resorting to overt military force to achieve a gain or
redress a grievance." According to this line of reasoning, then,
[enduring rivalries are the proper cases for the study of general
deterrence]{.underline}. Similarly, Diehl and Goertz focus attention on
rivalries, whether or not they become enduring, and argue that "the
rivalry approach provides a solution" (Diehl and Goertz 2000:91) to
problems with deterrence case selection. According to Diehl and Goertz
(2000), [a dyad is in a rivalry if they engage in a militarized
interstate dispute]{.underline}. Thus, selecting all rivalries as cases
of general deterrence would capture (by definition) all failures of
general deterrence.4 [However, **deterrence in dyads that have not
fought would be ignored**, which is particularly problematic because
**those are the dyads where deterrence has always worked**]{.underline}.
Furthermore, identification of the length of a rivalry, and thus the
span of general deterrence, requires the assumption that the rivalry
begins either with the first dispute (and thus deterrence failed when it
was attempted for the first time), or at some arbitrary length of time
before the first dispute and after the last.5 Therefore, [the rivalry
approach is limited as a path to general deterrence case
selection]{.underline}. However, [one can safely assume that **every
state wishes to deter attacks against itself**]{.underline}---this is
the basic rationale for the maintenance of armed forces (Morgan 1983).
This assumption is equivalent to the alliance portfolio literature's
assumption that every state has a defense pact with itself (Bueno de
Mesquita 1975; Signorino and Ritter 1999).6 Hence, [the difficult part
of general deterrence case selection is not determining who makes
deterrent threats (everyone does), but]{.underline} rather [**what
states the threats are directed against**. General deterrent threats are
directed against any state that **might consider an attack**; these are
states that have the **opportunity** for conflict]{.underline}. Thus,
[the key to selecting cases of general deterrence is **identifying
opportunity for conflict**]{.underline}.7 To identify cases where
opportunity exists, [I use the]{.underline} recently developed [concept
of politically active dyads]{.underline} (Quackenbush 2006a). [A dyad is
politically active "if at least one of the following]{.underline}
characteristics [applies]{.underline}: the [members]{.underline} of the
dyad [are contiguous]{.underline}, either directly or through a colony,
[one]{.underline} of the dyad members [is a global power,
one]{.underline} of the dyad members [is a regional power in the region
of the other]{.underline}, [one]{.underline} of the dyad members [is
allied to a state]{.underline} that is [contiguous to the other,
one]{.underline} of the dyad members [is allied to a global
power]{.underline} that is [in a dispute with the other, or
one]{.underline} of the dyad members [is allied to a regional
power]{.underline} (in the region of the other) that is [in a dispute
with the other]{.underline}" (Quackenbush 2006a:43). Quackenbush (2006a)
finds that [politically active dyads are able to **identify opportunity
as a necessary condition for international conflict**, while previous
measures of opportunity such as politically relevant dyads and regional
dyads are unable to do so]{.underline}. Thus, [we can have confidence
that **all politically active dyads could fight if they had the
willingness to do so**. The goal of deterrence is to dissuade other
states from attacking]{.underline} the deterring state. In other words,
[states seek to ensure that other states]{.underline}---those [**with
the opportunity to attack**---**do not gain the
willingness**]{.underline} to attack, and they do this **[through
deterrence]{.underline}**. While other empirically verified causes of
war certainly impact deterrence outcomes, opportunity is the key to
general deterrence case selection. [Some readers might be
concerned]{.underline} that [there is no attempt to determine whether
the challenger actually intends to attack]{.underline}, and thus,
whether the lack of an attack can meaningfully be considered general
deterrence success. [This]{.underline} issue [does not actually pose a
problem for the analysis here]{.underline}. The
[predictions]{.underline} being tested, from Table 1, [are about
**particular game outcomes**]{.underline}, **[not a dichotomous measure
of deterrence "success" and "failure]{.underline}**." Furthermore, these
predictions explicitly cover the case where the challenger has
absolutely no interest in attacking. While the three non-status quo
outcomes are essentially different categories of general deterrence
failure, the status quo outcome is not necessarily the result of
successful deterrence. For example, if Challenger prefers Status Quo to
Defender Concedes, the only rational outcome is Status Quo. Although
Challenger's decision to not challenge the status quo in this case is
not really "successful deterrence," it is predicted by perfect
deterrence theory. [For the cases that are selected]{.underline}
(because they are politically active), [I employ a directed-dyad-year
unit of analysis]{.underline}. Within a directed dyad, the direction of
interaction is important; for example, United States→Japan is one
directed dyad and Japan→United States is another. The Unilateral
Deterrence Game theoretically differentiates between the roles played by
each state in a dyad, so employing directed-dyads enables empirical
differentiation between the states in a dyad as well. Furthermore, since
each state in a politically active dyad has the opportunity for conflict
with the other, each state has an opportunity to challenge the status
quo. Therefore, each state is considered to be a potential challenger.
For example, in the United States→Japan directed dyad, the United States
is Challenger and Japan is Defender, while in the Japan→United States
directed dyad, Japan is Challenger and the United States is Defender.
Because most international relations data are based on annual
observations, the year is the time period used for the cross-sectional
time series data analysis conducted here. Therefore, [each politically
active directed-dyad-year constitutes an observation]{.underline}.
[Since general deterrence deals with the outbreak, rather than the
continuation, of international conflict]{.underline}, [I eliminate
dyad-years marked by a conflict continuing from the previous

#### Unipolarity is sustainable and creates a structural disincentive for great power war and escalation -- power vacuums causes cascade prolif and extinction

**Brands '15** (Hal, On the faculty at the Sanford School of Public
Policy at Duke University The Elliott School of International Affairs
The Washington Quarterly Summer 2015 38:2 pp. 7--28)

The fundamental reason is that [both U.S. influence and international
stability are **thoroughly interwoven with a robust U.S. forward
presence.**]{.underline} Regarding influence, [the protection that
Washington has afforded its allies has equally afforded the United
States great sway over those allies' policies]{.underline}.43 [During
the Cold War and after]{.underline}, for instance, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has used the
influence provided by its security posture to veto allies' **pursuit of
nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, [to obtain more advantageous **terms in
financial and trade agreements**]{.underline}, and even to affect the
composition of allied nations' governments.44 More broadly, it has used
its alliances as vehicles for shaping political, security, and economic
agendas in key regions and bilateral relationships, thus giving the
United States an outsized voice on a range of important issues. To be
clear, this influence has never been as pervasive as U.S. officials
might like, or as some observers might imagine. But by any reasonable
standard of comparison, it has nonetheless been remarkable. **[One can
tell a similar story about the relative stability of the post-war
order]{.underline}**. As even some leading offshore balancers have
acknowledged[, the lack of conflict in regions like Europe in recent
decades **is not something that has occurred naturally**]{.underline}.
[It has occurred **because the "American pacifier" has suppressed
precisely the dynamics that previously fostered geopolitical
turmoil**]{.underline}. [That pacifier has **limited arms races and
security competitions by providing the protection that allows other
countries to under-build their militaries**. It has soothed historical
rivalries by affording a climate of security in which powerful countries
like Germany and Japan could be revived economically and **reintegrated
into** thriving and fairly cooperative **regional orders**.]{.underline}
[It has induced caution in the behavior of **allies and adversaries
alike**, **deterring aggression and dissuading other destabilizing
behavior**]{.underline}. As John Mearsheimer has noted, the United
States "effectively acts as a night watchman," lending order to an
otherwise disorderly and anarchical environment.45 [What would happen if
Washington backed away from this role]{.underline}? The most logical
answer is that **[both U.S. influence and global stability would
suffer]{.underline}**. [With respect to influence,]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[would]{.underline} effectively [be **surrendering the most powerful
bargaining chip** it has traditionally wielded in dealing with friends
and allies,]{.underline} [and jeopardizing the position of leadership it
has used to shape bilateral and regional **agendas for
decades**]{.underline}. **[The consequences would seem no less damaging
where stability is concerned]{.underline}**. As offshore balancers have
argued, it may be that U.S. retrenchment would force local powers to
spend more on defense, while perhaps assuaging certain points of
friction with countries that feel threatened or encircled by U.S.
presence. But it equally stands to reason that [removing the American
pacifier would **liberate the more destabilizing influences that U.S.
policy had previously stifled**]{.underline}. [Long-dormant **security
competitions might reawaken as countries armed themselves** more
vigorously]{.underline}; **[historical antagonisms]{.underline}**
[between old rivals might **reemerge in the absence of a robust U.S.
presence** and the reassurance it provides]{.underline}. Moreover,
[countries that seek to revise existing regional orders in their
favor]{.underline}---think **[Russia]{.underline}** in
**[Europe]{.underline}**, or **[China]{.underline}** in Asia---might
indeed applaud U.S. retrenchment, but [they might just as plausibly feel
empowered to more assertively press their interests]{.underline}. If the
United States has been a kind of Leviathan in key regions, Mearsheimer
acknowledges, then "**[take away that Leviathan and there is likely to
be big trouble]{.underline}**."46 Scanning the global horizon today,
**[one can easily see where such trouble might arise]{.underline}**. [In
Europe,]{.underline} [a revisionist Russia is already destabilizing its
neighbors and contesting the post-Cold War settlement in the
region.]{.underline} [In the Gulf and broader Middle East, the threat of
Iranian ascendancy has stoked region-wide tensions manifesting in
**proxy wars** and hints of an **incipient arms race**, even as that
region also contends with a severe threat to its stability in the form
of the Islamic State. In East Asia, **a rising China is challenging the
regional status quo** in numerous ways, sounding alarms among its
neighbors---many of whom also have historical grievances against each
other.]{.underline} In these circumstances, [**removing the American
pacifier would likely yield not low-cost stability, but increased
conflict and upheaval.** That conflict and upheaval]{.underline}, in
turn, **[would be quite damaging to U.S. interests]{.underline}** even
if it did not result in the nightmare scenario of a hostile power
dominating a key region. **[It is hard to imagine]{.underline}**, for
instance, **[that increased instability and acrimony would produce the
robust multilateral cooperation necessary to deal with transnational
threats from pandemics to piracy]{.underline}**. **[More problematic
still might be the economic consequences.]{.underline}** As scholars
like Michael Mandelbaum have argued, [the enormous progress toward
global prosperity and integration that has occurred since World War
II]{.underline} (and now the Cold War) [has come in the climate of
relative stability and security provided largely by the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.47 [One simply cannot
confidently predict that this **progress would endure amid escalating
geopolitical competition in regions of enormous importance to the world
economy.**]{.underline} Perhaps [the greatest risk that a strategy of
offshore balancing would run]{.underline}, of course, **[is that a key
region might not be able to maintain its own balance following U.S.
retrenchment]{.underline}**. That prospect might have seemed far-fetched
in the early post-Cold War era, and it remains unlikely in the immediate
future. But [**in East Asia particularly,** the rise and growing
assertiveness of China has highlighted the medium- to long-term danger
that a hostile power could in fact **gain regional
primacy**]{.underline}. [If China's economy continues to grow
rapidly]{.underline}, and if Beijing continues to increase military
spending by 10 percent or more each year, [then its neighbors will
ultimately face grave challenges in containing Chinese power **even if
they join forces in that endeavor**]{.underline}. This possibility,
ironically, is one to which leading advocates of retrenchment have been
attuned. "The United States will have to play a key role in countering
China," Mearshimer writes, "because its Asian neighbors are not strong
enough to do it by themselves."48 If this is true, however, then
**[offshore balancing becomes a dangerous and potentially self-defeating
strategy]{.underline}**. As mentioned above, [it could lead countries
like Japan and South Korea to **seek nuclear weapons**]{.underline},
thereby [stoking arms races and elevating regional
tensions]{.underline}. Alternatively, and perhaps more worryingly, [it
might encourage the scenario that offshore balancers seek to avoid, by
easing China's **ascent to regional hegemony.**]{.underline} As Robert
Gilpin has written, "[Retrenchment by its very nature is **an indication
of relative weakness** and **declining power**, and thus retrenchment
can have a **deteriorating effect on relations with allies and
rivals**]{.underline}."[49 In East Asia today, U.S. allies rely on U.S.
reassurance to navigate increasingly fraught relationships with a more
assertive China precisely **because they understand that they will have
great trouble balancing Beijing on their own**]{.underline}. A
significant U.S. retrenchment might therefore tempt these countries to
acquiesce to, or bandwagon with, a rising China if they felt that
prospects for successful resistance were diminishing as the United
States retreated.50 In the same vein, retrenchment would compromise
alliance relationships, basing agreements, and other assets that might
help Washington check Chinese power in the first place---and that would
allow the United States to surge additional forces into theater in a
crisis. In sum, if one expects that Asian countries will be unable to
counter China themselves, then reducing U.S. influence and leverage in
the region is a curious policy. Offshore balancing might promise to
preserve a stable and advantageous environment while reducing U.S.
burdens. But upon closer analysis, the probable outcomes of the strategy
seem more perilous and destabilizing than its proponents acknowledge.

### 2AC Human Security Good 

#### Human security is able to challenge the foundational notions of state control---moral based approaches to international relations reproduce a society with less violence and suffering

Writing in the aftermath of the end of the Cold War, constructivist
theorising, which challenged the structural fixity of neoliberal and
neo-realist thought, found a ready audience. It appeared that the study
of states and state interests could no longer adequately explain
international politics. Instead, the research focus shifted away from
fixed identities and narrow material interests to one which emphasised
the power of norms and ideas. Alexander Wendt argued that it was not
just the distribution of power that was important but also the
'distribution of knowledge': the intersubjective understandings which
constitute the state's conception of its self and its interests. As
examples, he stated that having a powerful neighbor in the US meant
something different to Canada than it did for Cuba and that British
missiles would have seemed more of a threat to the Soviet Union than to
the US (1992: 397). It was [the interaction between states]{.underline}
that [shaped their identities and interests]{.underline}. Rather than
power, it was subjective conceptions that were important; therefore: 'if
the United States and Soviet Union decide that they are no longer
enemies, "the cold war is over"' (1992: 397). The collapse of the Soviet
Union, through implosion rather than military defeat, fundamentally
challenged realist perspectives of state interests and the importance of
military power, and thereby facilitated the revival of more idealist
perspectives of change -- based on social interaction rather than
material interests. As Wendt famously stated, inversing the rationalist
framework: 'Identities are the basis of interests' (1992: 398). The
focus on ideas, rather than interests, led to a more expansive
understanding of social interaction, giving a central role to
idea-promoting and idea-generating non-state actors, particularly
activist NGOs. It is at this point that the concept of transnational or
global relations comes in, in distinction to international relations,
i.e. relations between states. The [international sphere]{.underline} is
[no longer]{.underline} seen as [one in which states project their
national interests, instead]{.underline} the process is reversed;
through participation in international and transnational relations, [the
national interests of states are constituted]{.underline}. In this way,
the end of the Cold War could be held not just to discredit realist
approaches but also to provide compelling evidence of the role of
non-state actors in the development of state 'identities' and interests.
Over this period, the growth of international human security approaches
and frameworks is one of the leading examples, held to demonstrate the
strength of constructivist approaches: 'because [international
human-centred norms challenge state rule over society and national
sovereignty, any impact on domestic change would be
counter-intuitive']{.underline} (Risse and Sikkink 1999: 4). The
assumption that [human security norms challenge nationstate interests
therefore asserts that norm changes cannot come solely from state agency
but must also stem from the influence of transnational non-state actors.
Even where states may use the normative rhetoric, such as human rights
concerns, it is the influence of non-state actors which serves to
prevent these from being used in a purely instrumental way]{.underline}.
For constructivist theorists, [the shift in the articulation of
foreign-policy goals, from a narrow framing of national interests to
global framings of human security, demonstrated the growing capacity of
moral values to constrain the interests of power]{.underline}. A leading
article in Foreign Affairs , for example, argued: 'Humanitarian
intervention . . . is perhaps the most dramatic example of the new power
of morality in international affairs' (Gelb and Rosenthal 2003: 6). As
Mary Kaldor asserts: The changing international norms concerning
humanitarian intervention can be considered an expression of an emerging
global civil society. [The changing norms do reflect a growing global
consensus about the equality of human beings and the responsibility to
prevent suffering]{.underline} . . . Moreover, this consensus, in turn,
is the outcome of a global public debate on these issues. (2001: 110)
[Crucial for the constructivist perspective was the belief that this
'global public debate' took place not on the terms of power but those of
morality.]{.underline} Sikkink argues that [activities of non-state
actors have been able to 'transform', 'modify' and 'reshape' the meaning
of sovereignty because sovereignty is a product of a set of 'shared' or
'intersubjective understandings about the legitimate scope of state
authority]{.underline}' (Sikkink 1993: 413, 441). [The human security
orientated debates on international humanitarian intervention and human
rights form the core of the idealist constructivist thesis]{.underline}.
Jack Donnelly, for example, views this dialogue as a 'promising sign for
the future' because it is a debate which takes 'place largely within a
space delimited by a basic moral commitment' to the human rights cause
(1999: 99-- 100[). The constructivist 'turn' in international relations
fundamentally challenged the previous rationalist assumptions of the
pursuit of pre-formed state interests in the international sphere. It
was alleged that in today's globalised world, with the emergence of
transnational linkages, committed transnational ethical campaigners were
capable of changing the identity, and thereby the interests, of leading
states.]{.underline} What is crucial to this thesis is the
socially-constructed identity of the state actor rather than the alleged
structural constraints, where ideas are understood to be merely a
reflection of pre-given material interests. The non-instrumentalist
assumptions made for discourses of human security rest heavily on the
constructivist framework, which assumes a connection between moral or
ethical discourse and a power to shape identities and interests. Very
few commentators have attempted to understand the rise of 'human
security' frameworks outside the constructivist framework and, as will
be drawn out, this framework forms the basis of the critical shift
against human security after the end of the 1990s. The fundamental break
involved in the constructivist approach was that of inversing the
relationship between states and the international or global sphere.
Where, previously, states were the key objects of study -- as the core
actors and instrumentally-orientated rational subjects constituting the
international sphere -- within the constructivist framework, state
policy frameworks were the products of international or global
discourse. The subject of study switched from privileging the formation
of state interests at the domestic level to privileging their
communicative interaction, the declarations of norms and values, which
were held to shape state identities and policy-making. Taking on board
the starting logic of realism -- that states pursue their narrow
strategic self-interests -- constructivists assumed that it was the
external pressures of global interaction and campaigning NGOs which
explained the shifting nature of the discourses of foreign policy. While
the constructivist focus on discourse remains very much central to
dominant perceptions of human security, the constructivist framework,
outlined earlier, tends to reflect the sensibilities of the 1990s rather
than the 2000s.

### 2AC IR Focus Good 

#### Studying international relations is key to producing good scholarship -- remedies the split between the ivory tower and practical realities

**Walt '11** (Stephen, Prof Intl Affairs @ Harvard, "International
Affairs and the Public Sphere",
http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/walt-international-affairs-and-the-public-sphere/)

Most [social scientists would like to believe that their profession
contributes to solving pressing global problems.]{.underline} Indeed,
the United States and many other modern societies subsidize
university-based research and teaching on the assumption that scholars
will develop useful knowledge about today's world, communicate that
knowledge to their students and to the broader public, and, where
appropriate, offer rigorous, well-informed advice to interested
policymakers. There is today no shortage of global problems that social
scientists should study in depth: ethnic and [religious conflict within
and between states, the challenge of economic development, terrorism,
the management of a fragile world economy, climate change]{.underline}
and other forms of environmental degradation, the origins and impact of
great power rivalries, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, just
to mention a few. In this complex and contentious world, [one might
think that academic expertise about global affairs would be a highly
valued commodity]{.underline}. [Scholars would strive to produce useful
knowledge,]{.underline} students would flock to courses that helped them
understand the world in which they will live and work, [and policymakers
and the broader public would be eager to hear what academic experts had
to say]{.underline}. [One might also expect scholars of international
relations to play a prominent role in public debates]{.underline} about
foreign policy, along with government officials, business interests,
representatives of special interest groups, and other concerned
citizens. [Social scientists are far from omniscient, but the rigor of
the scientific process and the core values of academia should give
university-based scholars an especially valuable role within the broader
public discourse on world affairs]{.underline}. At its best, [academic
scholarship]{.underline} [privileges creativity]{.underline}, validity,
accuracy, and rigor [and places little explicit value on political
expediency]{.underline}. The norms and procedures of the academic
profession make it less likely that scholarly work will be tailored to
fit pre-conceived political agendas. When this does occur, the
self-correcting nature of academic research makes it more likely that
politically motivated biases or other sources of error will be exposed.
Although we know that scholarly communities do not always live up to
this ideal picture, the existence of these basic norms gives the
academic world some important advantages over think tanks, media
pundits, and other knowledge-producing institutions. Yet the precise
role that academic scholars of international affairs should play is not
easy to specify. Indeed, there appear to be two conflicting ways of
thinking about this matter. On the one hand, there is a widespread sense
that academic research on global affairs is of declining practical
value, either as a guide to policymakers or as part of broader public
discourse about world affairs. [Former policymakers complain that
academic writing is "either irrelevant or inaccessible to
policy-makers]{.underline}. . . [locked within the circle of esoteric
scholarly discussion."]{.underline} This tendency helps explain
Alexander George's recollection that policymakers' eyes "would glaze as
soon as I used the word theory."\[1\] As Lawrence Mead noted in 2010:
"[Today's political scientists often address very narrow questions and
they are often preoccupied with method and past literature]{.underline}.
[Scholars are focusing more on themselves, less on the real
world]{.underline}. . . . Research questions are getting smaller and
data-gathering is contracting. [Inquiry is becoming obscurantist and
ingrown.]{.underline}"\[2\] Within the field of international affairs,
[this trend has led to repeated calls to "bridge the gap" between the
ivory tower and the policy community]{.underline}.\[3\] Consistent with
that aim, a number of prominent scholars have recently organized
workshops or research projects seeking to challenge this "cult of
irrelevance" and deprogram its adherents, although it is not clear
whether these efforts will succeed in reversing the current drift.\[4\]
This [online
symposium](http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/category/all/academia-public-sphere/)
reflects a similar concern: how can the academic world contribute to a
healthy public conversation about our collective fate, one that leads to
more effective or just solutions to contemporary problems and helps
humankind avoid major policy disasters? On the other hand, closer
engagement with the policy world and more explicit efforts at public
outreach are not without their own pitfalls. Scholars who enter
government service or participate in policy debates may believe that
they are "speaking truth to power," but they run the risk of being
corrupted or co-opted in subtle and not-so-subtle ways by the same
individuals and institutions that they initially hoped to sway. Powerful
interests are all-too-willing to use the prestige associated with
academic scholars to advance particular policy goals, and scholars are
hardly immune to temptations that may cloud their judgment or compromise
their objectivity. Furthermore, scholars who embrace the role of a
"public intellectual" may be tempted to sensationalize their findings to
attract a larger audience or find themselves opining on topics on which
they have no particular expertise. Instead of improving the quality of
public discourse, such behavior may actually degrade it. The remainder
of this essay explores these themes in greater detail. I begin by
discussing the unique contributions that academic scholars could make to
public discourse on world affairs---at least in theory---highlighting
their capacity to serve as an authoritative source of knowledge about
the world and as an independent voice in debates about contemporary
issues (→[Why Is Academic Scholarship
Valuable?](http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/walt-international-affairs-and-the-public-sphere#why-is-academic-scholarship-valuable)).
I then consider why there is a growing gap between university-based
scholars and both the policy world and the public sphere, and suggest
that [this trend is due largely to the professionalization of academic
disciplines and the concomitant rise of a quasi-academic
community]{.underline} of think tanks with explicit political agendas
(→[Why Is There a Gap between Academia and the Public
Sphere?](http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/walt-international-affairs-and-the-public-sphere#why-is-there-a-gap-between-academia-and-the-public-sphere)).
Next, I identify some of the pitfalls that scholars face when they
become more active participants in the public sphere (→[The Pitfalls of
Engagement](http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/walt-international-affairs-and-the-public-sphere#the-pitfalls-of-engagement)).
I conclude by proposing several reforms that could help the social
sciences make a more vital contribution to public understanding and
policy formation in the broad domain of global affairs (→[What Is To Be
Done?](http://publicsphere.ssrc.org/walt-international-affairs-and-the-public-sphere#what-is-to-be-done)).
Why Is Academic Scholarship Valuable?   [Academics can make at least
three distinct contributions to public discourse on global affairs.
First,]{.underline} although the digital revolution has made a wealth of
information from around the world accessible on a near real-time basis,
[most of us still lack both extensive direct data on events in far-flung
areas and the background knowledge necessary to understand what new
developments mean]{.underline}. If our town's school district is
troubled or the local economy is suffering, we can observe that for
ourselves and make reasonably well-informed judgments about what might
be done about it. But [if the issue]{.underline} [is]{.underline} the
war in Afghanistan, [an uprising in Yemen]{.underline}, a naval
confrontation in the South China Sea or the prospects that some battered
economy will be bailed out successfully, [most of us will lack the
factual knowledge or conceptual understanding to know what is really
going on]{.underline}. Even when basic information is readily available,
it may be hard for most of us to put it in the appropriate context or
make sense of what it means. [When citizens and leaders seek to grasp
the dizzying complexity]{.underline} of modern world politics,
therefore, [they must inevitably rely upon the knowledge and insights of
specialists]{.underline} in military affairs, global trade and finance,
diplomatic/international historians, area experts, and many others. And
that means relying at least in part on academic scholars who have
devoted their careers to mastering various aspects of world affairs and
whose professional stature has been established through the usual
procedures of academic evaluation (e.g., peer review, confidential
assessments by senior scholars, the give-and-take of scholarly debate,
etc.). Second, and more importantly, [an independent academic community
is an essential counterweight to official efforts to shape public
understanding of key foreign policy issues. Governments enjoy enormous
information asymmetries]{.underline} in many areas of political life,
but these advantages are especially pronounced when dealing with
international affairs.\[5\][Much of what we know about the outside world
is ultimately derived from government sources]{.underline} (especially
when dealing with national security affairs), and public officials often
go to considerable lengths to shape how that information is reported to
the public. [Not only do governments collect vast amounts of information
about the outside world, but they routinely use secrecy laws to control
public access to this information]{.underline}. [Government officials
can shape public beliefs by leaking information
strategically]{.underline}, or by co-opting sympathetic journalists
whose professional success depends in part on maintaining access to key
officials.\[6\]Given these information asymmetries and their obvious
interest in retaining public support for their preferred policies, it is
hardly surprising that both democratic and non-democratic leaders use
their privileged access to information to build support for specific
policies, at times by telling outright lies to their own citizens.\[7\]
This situation creates few problems when the policies being sold make
good strategic sense, but the results can be disastrous when they don't.
In such cases, [alternative voices are needed to challenge conventional
wisdoms and official rationales]{.underline}, and [to suggest different
solutions to the problem(s) at hand]{.underline}. Because
[scholars]{.underline} are protected by tenure and cherish the principle
of academic freedom, and because they are not directly dependent on
government support for their livelihoods, they [are uniquely positioned
to challenge prevailing narratives and policy rationales]{.underline}
[and to bring their knowledge and training to bear on vital policy
issues.]{.underline} If we believe that unfettered debate helps expose
errors and correct missteps, thereby fostering more effective public
policies, then a sophisticated, diverse and engaged scholarly community
is essential to a healthy polity. Third, the scholarly world also offers
a potentially valuable model of constructive political disagreement.
Political discourse in many countries (and especially the United States)
has become increasingly personal and ad hominem, with little attention
paid to facts and logic; a trend reinforced by an increasingly
competitive and loosely regulated media environment. Within academia, by
contrast, even intense disputes are supposed to be conducted in
accordance with established canons of logic and evidence. Ad hominem
attacks and other forms of character assassination have no place in
scholarly discourse and are more likely to discredit those who employ
them than those who are attacked. By bringing the norms of academic
discourse into the public sphere, academic scholars could help restore
some of the civility that has been lost in recent years. For all of
these reasons, [it is highly desirable for university-based scholars to
play a significant role in public discourse about key real-world issues
and to engage directly with policymakers]{.underline} where appropriate.
As I have argued elsewhere, [academic research can provide policymakers
with relevant factual knowledge, provide typologies and frameworks that
help policymakers and citizens make sense of emerging
trends]{.underline}, [and create and test theories that leaders can use
to choose among different policy instruments.]{.underline} [Academic
theories can also be useful when they help policymakers anticipate
events,]{.underline} when they identify recurring tendencies or
obstacles to success, [and when they facilitate the formulation of
policy alternatives]{.underline} and the identification of benchmarks
that can guide policy evaluation. Because academic scholars are free
from daily responsibility for managing public affairs, they are in an
ideal position to develop new concepts and theories to help us
understand a complex and changing world.\[8\] The picture sketched here
is obviously something of an ideal type, and I am not suggesting that
that the academic world consistently lives up to these expectations. As
noted above, university-based scholars of international affairs---and
especially the disciplines of political science and history---have
increasingly focused on narrow and arcane topics and are contributing
less and less to policy formation or public discourse.\[9\] And when
academics do address topics of obvious policy relevance or public
interest, the results are often presented in impenetrable, jargon-ridden
prose and disseminated in venues that neither policymakers nor the
public are likely to read. Even when scholars have something useful to
say, in short, their tendency to "speaking in tongues" diminishes their
impact on the public sphere.

### 2AC Militarism Good 

#### Military power is necessary to maintaining US global influence -- the alternative is comparatively worse

Future American Grand Strategy: Time for an "Off Shore" Approach?" in
Conflict Management and Peacebuilding: Pillars of a New American Grand
Strategy 133-157)

AMERICAN GRAND STRATEGY AND CONFLICT

Quite obviously, the values of an American grand strategy so defined
thrive best in a conflict-free environment. Historically---and, indeed,
to this day---the primary purpose of the state is to create that
environment. The means of doing so frequently was---and, it seems, still
is---to organize the means of violence on behalf of the state---or
collection of states---and to apply it whenever the condition of peace
was disturbed or threatened. [In a perfect world, individuals and states
inclined to disrupt peace would be deterred from doing so by the
prospect of conflict that]{.underline}, as a matter of logic, [would
be]{.underline} an [inefficient and cost-prohibitive]{.underline} means
of resolving disputes.

[It is not, of course, a perfect world]{.underline}. [Some individuals
and states have perceived, and]{.underline} likely [will continue to
perceive, a security asymmetry that can be exploited to their
benefit]{.underline}. What is more, [for a variety of
reasons]{.underline}---[religion, ideology, cultural identity, and
more]{.underline}---[they can rationalize a sense of entitlement of
superiority]{.underline} for themselves. [Such perceptions]{.underline}
can [translate]{.underline}---[however
illogically]{.underline}---[into]{.underline} a belief that those so
disposed possess the power to achieve their ends by [force]{.underline}.
[Efforts to dissuade such conclusions can be effective, but have their
limits]{.underline} simply because intransigence can also be a feature
of the human mind, and one that can contaminate the thinking of entire
societies, to include those who are otherwise cosmopolitan and even
generally pacific.

Plato reportedly adroitly observed that "only the dead have seen the end
of war." Thus, [we must accept that the nature of the human condition is
such that for the foreseeable future]{.underline}---[irrespective of any
grand strategy]{.underline}---[the vagaries of the human
condition]{.underline}---[not to mention]{.underline} humanity's
[aggressive impulses]{.underline}---[will continue]{.underline} to
challenge the success of an American grand strategy as I defined it.

Yet [the inevitability of human conflict does not mean we should abandon
efforts to avoid it]{.underline}. [Every instance of success represents
lives saved and futures preserved]{.underline}. [Even where violence
cannot be avoided, efforts to ameliorate and limit its effects are
patently worthy endeavors because they]{.underline} readily [encourage a
minimization of human suffering]{.underline}, as well as help create a
space, so to speak, for liberal democracy and free enterprise to take
root and prosper.

The question then is how best to create those spaces in an era of the
ever present risk of violence? In an interesting article in the
March/April 2012 issue of Foreign Affairs entitled "A Clear and Present
Safety," the authors Micha Zenko and Michael A. Cohen assert that
America is safer and more secure than ever before, and faces no great
power rival and no serious threats.5 According to Zenko and Cohen, the
United States needs a foreign policy that reflects that reality.

The article also contends that:

because of the chronic exaggeration of the threats facing the United
States, Washington overemphasizes military approaches to problems
(including many that could best be solved by nonmilitary means).6

It goes on to insist that:

although U.S. military strength has occasionally contributed to creating
a conducive environment for positive change, those improvements were
achieved mostly through the work of civilian agencies and
nongovernmental actors in the private and nonprofit sectors.7

[Zenko and Cohen]{.underline} are not alone in their views. In his
recent book, Winning the War on War, Joshua Goldstein made a similar
[claim]{.underline}, arguing that, "in fact, [the world is becoming more
peaceful]{.underline}."8 Goldstein gives great credit not to the United
States, but to the United Nations (UN) for its peacekeeping and other
operations that he argues could be even more successful were they better
funded and supported.

While there is much to commend about Zenko and Cohen's essay (as well as
the Goldstein book), the problem with the thesis that both propound is
the insufficient appreciation of what the world will be like if U.S.
military power is perceived as compromised. If that were to become the
case, there is the extraordinarily dangerous prospect that opportunistic
nations will destabilize the world if they get the impression that U.S.
military power is on the wane, let alone being deliberately diminished.
Some around the globe may cheer but, unfortunately, many are not
necessarily the friends of peace.

[The real value of U.S. military power is that its mere existence in
many instances permits]{.underline}---and gives gravitas to---the very
civilian/nongovernmental organization (NGO) [soft power]{.underline}
concepts Zenko et al. endorse. To be sure, it is quite true that many
successes in the past were the product of [diplomatic, humanitarian,
economic, and other distinctly nonmilitary efforts]{.underline}, but
they were accomplished in a world where enormous [American military
power was always lurking in the background]{.underline}. The reality, as
uncomfortable as it may be for many, is that [the U.S. military is the
irreplaceable peace enabler in today's world]{.underline}.

There is little reason to assume that the same kind of soft-power
victories that Zenko and others celebrate would be possible if the
military equation is altered in a serious way. [Should]{.underline} the
[overwhelming U.S. conventional]{.underline}---[and
unconventional]{.underline}---[capability recede, adversaries may see
opportunity]{.underline}, perhaps not today, but in the foreseeable
future. [Once]{.underline} a capability is [dismantled]{.underline}---as
has been done by the United States with the F-22 manufacturing line9
---[it is very difficult]{.underline}, if not impossible, [to
resurrect]{.underline} it. We must never forget that [U.S. military
power takes the military option off the table for many
competitors]{.underline}. Economic, social, political, etc.,
competitions remain, but creating an environment where the military
option becomes conceivable is hardly a desirable outcome.

To be clear, [one might rightly agree that U.S. military spending must
come down]{.underline} to some degree in order to help get our economic
house in order, and that the nonmilitary elements of American power need
to be better brought to bear in the execution of American grand strategy
in the years to come. [Yet]{.underline}, some still believe that [U.S.
military might must remain the fundamental]{.underline}---if not
central---[element of American grand strategy]{.underline} for as long
as we can imagine.

PEACEBUILDING AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT: THE LESSONS LEARNED

Of course, [devising a fresh approach to peacebuilding and conflict
management requires an unvarnished examination of the operations of the
past decade]{.underline}, and there are certainly many lessons to be
learned from the conflicts [in Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}. [The
effort to reorient entire societies]{.underline} in Iraq and Afghanistan
via a strategy [that was manpower-intensive and ground-centric has
proven to be flawed]{.underline}.

Certainly, the American Soldier, given enough time and enough resources,
can accomplish almost anything, to include the remaking of entire
countries. The problem is that doing so first requires the application
of military force to the existing ruling cadre and its instruments of
power so sternly and persistently as to imprint upon the society a sense
of defeat so complete that the environment is created where a completely
new and---it is to be hoped---more peaceful and democratic society can
emerge and the likelihood of resistance is markedly diminished.

Norman Friedman suggests this in his 2004 article Is Modern War Too
Precise?10 In it, he indicates that for all its faults and shortcomings,
the devastating World War II aerial bombardment of Germany may not have
won many "hearts and minds" among the German people "but it did help
preclude any post-surrender violence like what is now being seen in
Iraq."11 Regrettably, in Iraq, an ill-considered "race to Baghdad" in
2003 stretched logistic lines and enabled Saddam's Fedayeen to achieve
some tactical success against support troops poorly prepared for
infantry combat. This became something of a "proof of concept" for Iraqi
insurgents that U.S. troops were, in fact, vulnerable.

It would have been far better to have exercised more patience and
allowed American air and artillery to progressively devastate Iraq's
elite military formations. Instead, they were allowed to melt away and
form the core of the insurgency, which was never really crushed in
nearly a decade of occupation. The Iraqi people---to include especially
those who became the resistance---never internalized the shattering
sense of defeat that enabled the Germans and Japanese at the end of
World War II to abandon their deeply embedded militaristic, racist, and
totalitarian ideologies.

Despite the experience with Japan and Germany, American leaders do not
seem to fully comprehend what it takes to truly transform entire
societies in a timeline shorter than several generations. Curiously,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey admitted
that the aim of purging Afghanistan of the Taliban could have been
achieved militarily, since the United States:

could have started at one end of Afghanistan and fundamentally overrun
it, destroyed it, created a situation where we would make it a near
certainty that the Taliban couldn't come back, because there wouldn't be
anything to come back to. . . .12

General Dempsey hastened to add that such a forceful effort was "not who
we are."13 There are, of course, several observations to be made here,
starting with the idea that [American values extant during World War II
are not necessarily ones to be abandoned]{.underline}. More
specifically, [if the suggestion is that focusing on the destruction of
the enemy]{.underline}---the Taliban in this instance---[invariably
involves the wholesale obliteration of civilians and their property, he
underestimates the revolutionary capabilities of a technological
revolution that allows force to be applied in a discrete way that is
fully lawful and moral]{.underline}. [That technological revolution
has]{.underline}, according to retired General Barry R. McCaffrey,
"[fundamentally changed the nature of warfare]{.underline}" [by allowing
the rise of persistent]{.underline}, [long-term reconnaissance and
precision strikes]{.underline}.14

[It is becoming increasingly clear that
force]{.underline}---particularly in counterinsurgency (COIN)
situations---[is the proven solution]{.underline}, especially when rapid
results are needed. As Professor Anna Simons of the Naval Postgraduate
School contends:

Not only does COIN's own history reflect the need for a stunning amount
of brutality, but the fact that in campaign after campaign, commanders
have found themselves desperate to be able to apply decisive force
reveals what every generation ends up (re)discovering the hard way[:
soft approaches don't impel enough people to change their ways fast
enough]{.underline}.15 Her conclusion fits with that of an ever-widening
range of experts. Jill Hazelton of Harvard's Belfer Center contends,
contrary to popular wisdom, that

\[s\]uccess in COIN does not require the protection of the populace,
good governance, economic development, or winning the allegiance or the
loyalty of the great majority of the population.

Importantly, she says [it "does not require building up all of the
institutions of the state."]{.underline}16 The grim realities of which
she speaks should give pause to COIN theorists who disparage the
efficacy of force. In April 2011, the Washington Post reported that in
Afghanistan, the:

security improvements have been the result of intense fighting and the
use of high-impact weapons systems not normally associated with the
protect-the-population counterinsurgency mission. 17

[Nevertheless, because the U.S. military establishment was dominated by
ground-centric thinkers, the "solution"]{.underline} to the challenge of
peacebuilding and conflict management [necessarily had to involve ground
forces, and lots of them]{.underline}. In the case of
[COIN]{.underline}, that solution doctrinally eschewed force. Such was
the nature of Field Manual (FM) 3-24, 18 published in 2006. [It
was]{.underline}, as one pundit put it, ["warfare for northeastern
graduate students"]{.underline} [and]{.underline} other ["people who
would never own a gun."]{.underline}19 Among other things, [it called
for enormous numbers of counterinsurgents]{.underline} (to comprise
about 5 percent of the populations), with each Soldier prepared, as the
FM said, to become "a social worker, a civil engineer, a school teacher,
a nurse, a boy scout."20 Nation building quite obviously was a critical
element of the doctrine.

[Executing the doctrine]{.underline} espoused in FM 3-24 [justified huge
increases in the size of American ground forces]{.underline}.
[Unfortunately, it ignored some key history]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} COIN operations and [the presence of a large number
of foreign troops]{.underline}. COIN expert William R. Polk insists that
[the "fundamental motivation" for insurgents is an "aim primarily to
protect the integrity of the native group from
foreigners."]{.underline}21 Likewise, in 2008, former Army Chief of
Staff General John Wickham warned that ["\[l\]arge military forces
alienate local populations, succeed less and cost more."]{.underline}22

More recently, John Brennan, Assistant to the President

for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism,

pointed out:

[Countries typically don't want foreign soldiers in their cities and
towns]{.underline}. In fact, [large, intrusive military deployments risk
playing into al-Qa'ida's strategy of trying to draw us into long, costly
wars]{.underline} [that drain us financially, inflame anti-American
resentment and inspire the next generation of terrorists]{.underline}.23

THE FUTURE: "OFF SHORE" PEACEBUILDING AND CONFLICT MANAGEMENT

[So what does all this mean]{.underline} for the future of peacebuilding
and conflict management, At [given the grand strategy I have
outlined?]{.underline} the outset, it is essential to understand that
[it does not mean that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should abandon peacebuilding and conflict management
efforts]{.underline}. Nor does it mean that it is utterly inconceivable
that the United States might again conduct a large-footprint operation à
la Iraq or Afghanistan. What it does mean, however, is that
largefootprint operations for peacebuilding and conflict management
missions need to undergo fundamental rethinking.

Part of this requires the acceptance, however unwanted, of certain cold
political realities, which include the fact that public support for the
large-footprint war in Afghanistan is collapsing. [Not only do 78
percent of Americans favor withdrawing troops,]{.underline}24 [66
percent believe that]{.underline} the [war has not been "worth
fighting."]{.underline}25 With respect to the latter, beyond the human
cost, our present strategy is extremely costly. The expense of deploying
one American Soldier to Afghanistan for 1 year has ballooned to \$1.2
million,26 a figure to which planners must be especially sensitive now
that the U.S. public is supporting substantial cuts in defense
spending.27

While it does seem that it might be cheaper to deploy civilians to
accomplish many of the nationbuilding tasks currently performed by the
military, the viability of that option is suspect.28 As a Congressional
Research Service report dated February 2, 2012, entitled Building
Civilian Interagency Capacity for Missions Abroad: Key Proposals and
Issues for Congress, reveals, the U.S. Government's ability to conduct
such missions remains deeply flawed, if not in disarray.29 In any event,
there is a tyranny of numbers involved, as even the most optimistic
assessments do not contemplate many more than 2,000 experts would be
involved, even if resources outside of government were tapped.30

Just as problematic is the sheer difficulty of peacebuilding and
conflict management in deeply flawed societies under circumstances
where, as indicated above, the political decision has been made not to
use force to the extent that has proven successful in past situations,
even if it can be applied in a way that is fully lawful and moral.
Still, [in conflict management situations, force will necessarily have
to be employed]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} likely [not via large
numbers of American ground forces]{.underline}. The models for the
future are more likely to be along the lines of the Kosovo intervention
of the late 1990s and Libya in 2011. As the New York Times put it:

Libya proved that the leaders of some medium-size powers can be
overthrown from a distance, without putting American boots on the
ground, by using weapons fired from sea and air with the heaviest load
carried by partner nations---in the case of Libya, European allies and
even some Arab states. 31

In essence, [this might be called "offshore conflict
management."]{.underline} [This is not]{.underline} an [especially
new]{.underline} concept, [and has been suggested for a number of
scenarios of potential conflict]{.underline}. Retired Marine Colonel
Thomas X. Hammes has, for example, developed a proposal he calls
"Offshore Control" aimed at leveraging U.S. technical advantages as a
means of addressing the security challenge of China without necessarily
putting a large mass of American troops on the Chinese mainland.32

In a sense, [options for conflict management that avoid large troop
deployments seem consonant with the]{.underline} Barack [Obama
administration's emphasis on counterterrorism operations]{.underline}
aimed at key enemy leaders [conducted by drones and special operations
forces]{.underline}. In fact, the President recently explicitly stated
that in Afghanistan, his "goal is not to build a country in America's
image" but rather "to destroy \[al-Qaeda\]."33 To the extent this
involves drone attacks against alQaeda leadership, [it has enormous
support from the American people]{.underline}, with 83 percent approving
of their use.34

### 2AC Positivism Good 

#### Positivism is the best lens for framing IR---the alt creates epistemic anarchy and destroys empirical analysis

**Brown '11** (Vernon, Cardiff U, "The Reflectivist Critique of
Positivist IR Theory", http://www.e-ir.info/?p=7328)

[There is a great deal of support for the positivist approach in IR
despite the critiques]{.underline} presented above. As the survey by
[Maliniak]{.underline} et al. [showed, seventy percent of American IR
scholars still consider themselves as positivists]{.underline} with a
number of the rest not yet reflectivist. [This is significant as the
United States is still considered to be the major force in IR
scholarship.]{.underline} [There are many reasons]{.underline} for this
continued success of positivism in IR, [the majority of which have to do
with either the continued reliance on empirical methods or the failure
of many reflectivists, especially the post-modernists, to offer any
suggestions to fill the epistemological void]{.underline} left by their
passing. David [Houghton]{.underline} (2008, p.118) [addresses both of
these by writing that despite their critique, reflectivists continue to
use empirical, observational methods and that it is not possible to be
anything but positivist because]{.underline}, as he writes, '[truth
claims about the world have to come from somewhere']{.underline}. He
also suggests that [reflectivists are essentially engaging in what can
only be perceived as a negative exercise since by continually
deconstructing theories one will eventually be left with nothing that is
considered a legitimate theory]{.underline}. Another issue raised in
response to the reflectivist critique focuses on the pluralism which
scholars have called for in the face of [epistemological
relativism.]{.underline} Lapid (1989, p.249) warns that such pluralism,
'[If adopted]{.underline} uncritically or taken to its logical
conclusion, \[[can\] deteriorate into a condition of epistemological
anarchy]{.underline} [under which almost any position can legitimately
claim equal hearing']{.underline}, and that [in such a state it would
become nearly impossible to distinguish theoretical proliferation from
theoretical growth]{.underline}. [Positivism defends itself by claiming
that scholarship is inherently observational, therefore
empirical]{.underline}, and that if reflectivism is followed to its
logical endpoint there would be no legitimate theories left because they
would have been either deconstructed or created without a means of
testing their legitimacy. Conclusion: [The critique of positivism by the
reflectivists is fundamentally an epistemological one]{.underline}. Each
side can and does make compelling arguments showing the strength of
their position. While it is important to acknowledge the positivists'
attempts to ground the discipline in a naturalist, scientific area there
is still the obvious fact that the assumptions on which their
epistemology is based are too easily deconstructed when they attempt to
explain phenomena and make predictions in the socially constructed world
which IR purports to study. As Milja Kurki (2009, p.442) suggests,
positivism fails to acknowledge the possibility that all theories are at
some level 'politically and socially contextualized'. This creates the
possibility for positivist theories to create predictions that are
fundamentally flawed as they have failed to take into account the
context within which their facts are constructed. This in turn allows
the reflectivist theorists to deconstruct the predictions due to
misunderstandings that arise from the lack of context in the
positivists' predictions. [The question of what positivism has to say in
a socially constructed and interpreted world is still an important
one]{.underline}, however, [since the study of IR is still in many ways
observational and therefore empirical.]{.underline} [There is also the
valid claim that in the face of the possible anarchical pluralism or
lack of legitimate theories left by reflectivist critiques there needs
to be some sense of scientific and theoretical grounding, and that
positivism provides that very thing]{.underline}. In the end,
reflectivism performs a valuable service in widening the range of
legitimate research that is possible by IR scholars and allowing such
research to take into account the understanding that the issues studied
are birthed by social conventions. There still must be, however, some
framework within this study to prevent the anarchy that could follow in
the wake of reflectivism and [while positivism is in no ways
perfect]{.underline}, or even close to it, [it still provides such a
framework that if made to be self-reflective and continually evolving,
could provide the stability needed.]{.underline}

### 2AC Realism Good 

#### Realism solves war -- any other model leads to a power vacuum 

**Edelstein '10** (2010, David, PhD in Political Science, Associate
Professor in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service and the
Department of Government at Georgetown University, "Why realists don't
go for bombs and bullets,"
http://foreignpolicy.com/2010/07/21/why-realists-dont-go-for-bombs-and-bullets/)

Thanks to Steve Walt for inviting me to contribute to his blog while he
is away on vacation. I have been a regular reader of Steve's blog since
it launched, and for my first post, I wanted to pick up on a motif that
I have seen running through Steve's posts: [Will realists
ever]{.underline} again [support]{.underline} the use of [military
force]{.underline} by the United States[?]{.underline}

Followers of this blog will by now have little doubt about how Walt felt
about the Iraq War or how he views the prospects for U.S. success in
Afghanistan. In fact, throughout the history of his blog, I can only
recall one case in which Walt advocated the use of U.S. military force
(and I think the realist credentials in that case are rather dubious).

**[There is a common perception]{.underline}** in the field of political
science **[that realists are war-mongering Neanderthals]{.underline}**
anxious to use military force at the drop of a hat. Attend any meeting
(if you must) of the American Political Science Association or the
International Studies Association, and [one will find realists derided
as the \"bombs and bullets guys\"]{.underline} as if we were all direct
descendants of Curtis LeMay. [What is notable]{.underline} about this
--- and what has been notable about Steve's blog --- [is just how
**infrequently realists have supported the use of American military
force**]{.underline}. [Take]{.underline} the U.S. interventions of the
post-Cold War period: [Panama, the Gulf War, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia,
Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq]{.underline}. [Of those interventions,
Afghanistan was the only one that received anything close to strong
support from most realists. Others,]{.underline} [most notably the Iraq
War, **received vehement opposition from the vast majority of
realists**]{.underline}. [Even in the case of Afghanistan, realists
expressed trepidation about the prospects for]{.underline} ultimate
[success]{.underline} despite early victories.

[Go back to the Cold War]{.underline}, [and realists like]{.underline}
Kenneth [Waltz and]{.underline} Hans [Morgenthau were famously opposed
to the U.S. intervention in Vietnam]{.underline}. [Lest one think this
is an academic phenomenon, realist policymakers like]{.underline} Brent
[Scowcroft were equally critical]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the Bush
administration's actions in [Iraq]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} George
F. [Kennan was skeptical of]{.underline} the U.S. interventions in [both
Korea and Vietnam]{.underline}. [Today, should anyone dare to suggest
the use of military force in new contexts such as Iran, they are
summarily dismissed by prominent realists]{.underline}. **[Not a
single]{.underline}** (self-proclaimed or attributed)
**[realist]{.underline}** I know of **[has advocated the use of military
force against Iran]{.underline}** in response to its apparent
development of nuclear weapons, and most are adamantly opposed to it.

From one perspective, this opposition is surprising. It is realists,
after all, who so value material power, in particular military
capabilities. It is not difficult to understand why so many would assume
that realists are anxious to use military force because realists are
anxious to focus on military capabilities as a primary explanatory
variable for international politics.

But **[it is precisely because realists have spent so much time studying
military force that they are also so reluctant to use military
force]{.underline}**. Though realists themselves are divided on the
question, [many have concluded that]{.underline} the use of military
[force is]{.underline} often [counterproductive]{.underline}, inviting
balancing coalitions that simply make life more difficult. Moreover, as
I have argued elsewhere, using military force to reorder societies is
very difficult and unlikely to succeed except in uncommon circumstances.

### 2AC Scenario Planning Good 

#### Scenario planning is good pedagogy -- leads to better IR education, deconstructs preexisting assumptions, and enables best research practices

**Mahnken and Junio 13** (Thomas, PhD, Jerome E. Levy Chair of Economic
Geography and National Security at the U.S. Naval War College and a
Visiting Scholar at the Philip Merrill Center for Strategic Studies at
The Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced
International Studies, and Timothy, Predoctoral Fellow, Center for

Political Science expected 2013, "Conceiving of Future War: The Promise
of Scenario Analysis for International Relations," International Studies
Review Volume 15, Issue 3, pages 374--395, September 2013)

[This article introduces]{.underline} political scientists to
[scenarios]{.underline}---future counterfactuals---[and demonstrates
their value in tandem with other methodologies]{.underline} and [across
a wide range of research questions]{.underline}. The authors describe
best practices regarding the scenario method and argue that [scenarios
contribute to theory building and development, identifying new
hypotheses, analyzing]{.underline} data-[poor research]{.underline}
topics, [articulating "world views," setting]{.underline} new [research
agendas, avoiding cognitive biases, and **teaching**]{.underline}. The
article also establishes the low rate at which scenarios are used in the
international relations subfield and situates scenarios in the broader
context of political science methods. The conclusion offers two detailed
examples of the effective use of scenarios.

In his classic work on scenario analysis, The Art of the Long View,
Peter [Schwartz commented that "social scientists often have a hard time
\[building scenarios\]; they have been trained to stay away]{.underline}
from 'what if?' questions [and concentrate on 'what was?'"]{.underline}
(Schwartz 1996:31). While Schwartz\'s comments were impressionistic
based on his years of conducting and teaching scenario analysis, his
claim withstands empirical scrutiny. [Scenarios---counterfactual
narratives about the future---are woefully underutilized among political
scientists]{.underline}. [The method is almost never taught]{.underline}
on graduate student syllabi, and a survey of leading international
relations (IR) journals indicates that scenarios were used in only 302
of 18,764 sampled articles. [The low rate at which political scientists
use scenarios]{.underline}---less than 2% of the time---[is
surprising]{.underline}; [the method is popular in fields as disparate
as business, demographics, ecology, pharmacology, public health,
economics, and epidemiology]{.underline} (Venable, Li, Ginter, and
Duncan 1993; Leufkens, Haaijer-Ruskamp, Bakker, and Dukes 1994; Baker,
Hulse, Gregory, White, Van Sickle, Berger, Dole, and Schumaker 2004;
Sanderson, Scherbov, O\'Neill, and Lutz 2004). [Scenarios also are a
**common tool employed by the policymakers** whom political scientists
study]{.underline}.

[This article seeks to elevate the status of scenarios]{.underline} in
political science [by demonstrating their usefulness for **theory
building and pedagogy**]{.underline}. [Rather than constitute mere
speculation regarding an unpredictable future]{.underline}, **[as
critics might suggest]{.underline}**, [scenarios assist scholars with
developing testable hypotheses, gathering data, and identifying a
theory\'s]{.underline} upper and lower [bounds]{.underline}.
Additionally, **[scenarios are an effective way to teach students to
apply theory to policy]{.underline}**. In the pages below, a "best
practices" guide is offered to advise scholars, practitioners, and
students, and an argument is developed in favor of the use of scenarios.
The article concludes with two examples of how political scientists have
invoked the scenario method to improve the specifications of their
theories, propose falsifiable hypotheses, and design new empirical
research programs.

### 2AC Trade Good 

#### Trade reduces inequality -- empirics prove de-globalization's worse

**Hillebrand 10** (Evan E., professor at the University of Kentucky,
"Deglobalization Scenarios: Who Wins? Who Loses?", Global Economy
Journal, Volume 10, Issue 2,
http://www.ifs.du.edu/assets/documents/hilldeglob.pdf)

Economists have used the Stolper-Samuelson (1941) theorem to show that
[trade is likely to have distributional effects on society,]{.underline}
especially that the scarce factor of production (in the US case, labor)
might be disadvantaged in favor of capital, and vice versa in a labor
abundant country such as China. The IFs model captures distributional
effects by tracing the impact of trade on economic output by sector,
each sector employing differing sets of labor skills and capital
intensity (Hughes and Hossain, 2003). In general, [relative returns
increase for skilled labor as the overall level of development
increases]{.underline} and as manufacturing increases its share in total
value added relative to agriculture. [In these trade-restricting
simulations,]{.underline} which tend to increase the relative size of
the manufacturing sector in many of the non-OECD countries,
[we]{.underline} would [expect the share of the work force engaged in
manufacturing to increase, resulting in **more highly paid workers and
thus reducing poverty and income inequality**]{.underline}. Reducing
imports of manufactured goods and FDI, however, reduces technological
advance especially in the poorer countries. Slower technological advance
results in slower productivity gains and smaller wage gains in all
sectors. How these conflicting forces affect incomes, poverty
headcounts, and inequality depends on the interaction of many
institutional and historical factors for each country represented in the
model.

The overall results, however, are quite clear: [while deglobalization
may encourage poor countries to increase the relative size of the
domestic manufacturing industry and this may **shift the relative wage
structure in a way that increases overall equality**]{.underline} (in 61
out of 155 non-OECD7 countries the Gini8 coefficient fell), the [slower
growth in productivity resulting from a slowing of international trade
results in low**er GDP growth, lower average income growth and higher
poverty headcounts in all but a very few countries**]{.underline} (Table
3).

[The results for Guatemala are typical. Imports of manufactured goods in
the forecast period **fall dramatically** between
scenarios,]{.underline} both in absolute terms and as a share of total
imports. Domestic value added in the manufacturing sector rises very
slightly in absolute terms, but [productivity growth for the economy as
a whole and in the manufacturing sector slows by about a half percentage
point a year due to reduced competition and reduced capital
flows]{.underline}. Overall [GDP and wage growth slows, but wages fall
relatively more in the high-skilled jobs]{.underline} because the
slowdown in productivity growth is greater in sectors that are
skillintensive. In addition, [returns to capital are lowered in this
low-productivity environment.]{.underline} These three forces result in
a shift in the income distribution in favor of the poor. The estimated
Gini coefficient in 2035 is .573 vs. .584 in the globalization scenario.
But this [gain in equality comes at the expense of lower incomes for
both the rich and the poor. Real GDP per capita in 2035 is 23 percent
less than in the globalization scenario and the number of people living
in extreme poverty is 340,000 more.]{.underline}

The [results are worse for China, a country whose growth has been
dependent on exports of manufactured goods. I]{.underline}n China,
exports of manufactured goods are down 70 percent by 2035 and
value-added by the manufacturing sector falls by 40 percent. Overall GDP
growth averages 1.1 percent a year less than in the globalization
scenario and [average GDP per capita in 2035 is 37 percent less. This
**huge fall in income is not compensated by a rise in equality**: the
decline in manufacturing pushes more workers **back into agriculture**
and the service sector which have more]{.underline} unskilled, [low-wage
jobs.]{.underline} The estimated Gini coefficient in 2035 is .489 vs.
.483 in the globalization scenario.

The policy changes in the deglobalization scenario tend to increase the
relative size of the manufacturing sector in the non-OECD countries that
were not already deeply integrated into the globalized trading system.
One hundred and five of the 155 non-OECD countries increase the relative
size of their manufacturing sectors in the deglobalization scenario, but
this rarely has positive national benefits. Only 33 countries increase
the absolute size of their manufacturing sector and only 9 countries are
able to raise their average GDP per capita. These nine are among the
smallest, poorest, and least globalized countries in the world.9 Only
one country---Eritrea---is able to increase average GDP per capita,
reduce inequality, and reduce its poverty headcount. For all the rest,
[the decrease in imports of manufactured goods and capital tends to
reduce equality or average incomes or increase poverty, or, in most
cases, all three because the growth-inhibiting aspects of trade and
capital slowdowns **overwhelm any positive distribution affects that may
result from structural changes in the economy.**]{.underline}

[In history, the effort to balance power quite often tended to start too
late to protect the security of some of the individual states. If the
balancing process begins too late]{.underline}, the [resulting amount of
force necessary to stop an aggressor is often much larger than if the
process had been started much earlier]{.underline}. For example, [the
fate of Czechoslovakia and Poland showed how non-intervention or waiting
for the "automatic" working through of the process turned out to be
problematic. Power cycle theory could also supplement the
structure-oriented nature of the traditional balance of power theory by
incorporating an agent-oriented explanation.]{.underline} This was
possible through its focus on the relationship between power and the
role of a state in the international system. It especially highlighted
the fact that a discrepancy between the relative power of a state and
its role in the system would result in a greater possibility for
systemic instability. In order to prevent this instability from
developing into a war, practitioners of international relations were to
become aware of the dynamics of changing power and role, adjusting role
to power. A statesperson here was not simply regarded as a prisoner of
structure and therefore as an outsider to the process but as an agent
capable of influencing the operation of equilibrium. Thus power cycle
theory could overcome the weakness of theoretical determinism associated
with the traditional balance of power. The question is often raised
whether government decision-makers could possibly know or respond to
such relative power shifts in the real world. According to Doran, when
the "tides of history" shift against the state, the push and shove of
world politics reveals these matters to the policy-maker, in that state
and among its competitors, with abundant urgency. (2) The Issue of
Systemic Stability Power cycle theory is built on the conception of
changing relative capabilities of a state, and as such it shares the
realist assumption emphasizing the importance of power in explaining
international relations. But its main focus is on the longitudinal
dimension of power relations, the rise and decline of relative state
power and role, and not on the static power distribution at a particular
time. As a result, power cycle theory provides a significantly different
explanation for stability and order within the international system.
First of all, [power cycle theory argues that what matters most in
explaining the stability of the international system or war and peace is
not the type of particular international system]{.underline}
(Rosecrance, 1963) [but the transformation from one system to
another]{.underline}. For example, [in the 1960s there was a debate on
the stability of the international system between the defenders of
bipolarity such as Waltz]{.underline} (1964) [and the defenders of
multi-polarity such as Rosecrance]{.underline} (1966), and Deutsch and
Singer (1964). After analyzing five historical occasions since the
origin of the modern state system, [Doran concluded that what has been
responsible for major war was not whether one type of system is more or
less conducive to war but that instead systems transformation itself led
to war]{.underline} (Doran, 1971). [A non-linear type of structural
change that is massive, unpredicted, devastating to foreign policy
expectation, and destructive of security is the trigger for major war,
not the nature of a particular type of international
system]{.underline}.
