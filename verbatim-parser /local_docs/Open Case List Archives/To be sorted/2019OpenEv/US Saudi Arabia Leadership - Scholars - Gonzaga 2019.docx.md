# Saudi Arms Sales -- Leadership Adv.

## 1AC Advantage -- Human Rights

#### **Tensions around arms sales to Saudi are high after the murder of Khashoggi and it's hurting global credibility**

Trump all the leverage he needs in Khashoggi

As president[, Trump]{.underline} clearly hopes that the money continues
to pour in and helps him with his "America First" campaign, intended to
create jobs for Americans.

It's no surprise, then, that [he made his first foreign trip as
president to Saudi Arabia in May 2017. During the trip, he reportedly
struck a bargain with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman: Trump
wouldn't lecture his kingdom on human rights, and Saudi Arabia would buy
more American weapons.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, Trump's claim to have secured \$110 billion in arms sales
has not materialized. Although the Saudis signed numerous letters of
intent and interest, some of which had been approved by the Obama
administration, no new contracts have resulted, due mainly to lower oil
prices and the Saudis' costly war in Yemen.

[So in the Khashoggi affair, it appears that Trump is eager to keep to
his end of the bargain. He has avoided criticizing the Saudi government
over its alleged role in Khashoggi's disappearance to curry favor with
the monarchy over arms sales]{.underline}. Even in the face of Turkish
reports that Saudi agents tortured Khashoggi and dismembered his body
and U.S. intelligence supporting those allegations, [Trump has preferred
to blame "rogue killers" for any crime.]{.underline}

In defending this course of action, Trump claimed that "if they don't
buy \[weapons\] from us, they're going to buy it from Russia or they're
going to buy it from China or they're going to buy it from other
countries."

US leverage

While it's true that Russia and China are indeed major exporters of
armaments, the claim that U.S. weapons can easily be replaced by other
suppliers is not -- at least not in the short term.

First, once a country is "locked in" to a specific kind of weapons
system, such as planes, tanks or naval vessels, the cost to switch to a
different supplier can be huge. Military personnel must be retrained on
new equipment, spare parts need to be replaced, and operational changes
may be necessary.

After being so reliant on U.S. weapons systems for decades, the
transition costs to buy from another country could be prohibitive even
for oil-rich Saudi Arabia.

The second problem with Trump's argument is that armaments from Russia,
China or elsewhere are simply not as sophisticated as U.S. weapons,
which is why they are usually cheaper -- though the quality gap is
quickly decreasing. To maintain its military superiority in the Middle
East, Saudi Arabia has opted to purchase virtually all of its weapons
from American and European companies.

That is why the U.S. has significant leverage in this aspect of the
relationship. Any Saudi threat to retaliate against a ban on U.S. arms
sales by buying weapons from countries that have not raised concerns
about the Khashoggi disappearance would not be credible. And is probably
why, despite worries in the White House, such a threat has not yet been
made.

[Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has developed a global
reputation as a moral authority championing human rights.]{.underline}

[Yes, there have been many times when realpolitik took
priority]{.underline}.

But [despite these moments, the U.S. managed also to maintain its
authority by advocating respect for human rights as a global norm during
the Cold War, and within many repressive regimes]{.underline} ever
since.

[With Khashoggi, Trump is choosing to give up that mantle completely by
showing his priority is purely economic, regardless of the impact on the
United States' global reputation. Such a bald-faced
strategy]{.underline}, in my view, [sells American values short and
weakens U.S. global credibility]{.underline}.

#### Trump's approach to Saudi arms sales *[decks]{.underline}* human rights credibility-- undermining congressional threats and blatantly ignoring human rights abuses -- cutting off sales now is key 

**Rogin, CNN political analyst, 2018**

\[Josh, 10-16-18, Washington Post, "Trump has it 'totally and completely
backwards' on Saudi arms sales,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/josh-rogin/wp/2018/10/16/trump-has-it-totally-and-completely-backwards-on-saudi-arms-sales/?utm_term=.7f015e6571cd,
6-26-19, GDI LNM\]

[When President Trump argues that the United States can't halt arms
sales to Saudi Arabia over the Saudis' alleged murder of journalist and
Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, he's giving up a key piece of leverage
over Riyadh for no reason at all]{.underline}. What's worse, [Trump is
also turning one of America's best strategic assets into a liability, a
massive unforced error that could weaken the United States
worldwide.]{.underline}

[Trump has said repeatedly he doesn't want to halt --- or even threaten
to halt --- U.S. arms sales to the Saudi regime because (he says) it
would cost U.S. jobs and hand over a sweet contract to Moscow or
Beijing.]{.underline}

"They are ordering military equipment. Everybody in the world wanted
that order. Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it. We got it,"
Trump said on "60 Minutes" Sunday. "I don't want to hurt jobs. I don't
want to lose an order like that."

Set aside that Trump's claim of \$110 billion of arms sales to Saudi
Arabia as announced last year is hugely exaggerated, considering that
number mostly refers to deals struck during the Obama administration and
new deals that haven't yet materialized. The significant arms-sales
relationship we do have with Saudi Arabia gives us enormous leverage
over them, leverage Trump should use to pressure King Salman to reveal
what his regime knows about Khashoggi's disappearance.

[Saudi Arabia's military is already built around U.S. and British
defense platforms, meaning they can't easily switch to Russian or
Chinese systems. Riyadh is especially dependent on U.S. arms right now
because their bloody war in Yemen requires a constant flow of U.S.
munitions, not to mention U.S. intelligence, maintenance and refueling
support]{.underline}.

[U.S. arms sales are not simply a financial deal or a jobs program; they
represent a strategic advantage of the United States. Countries want
U.S. weapons because they are the best. That gives us connections,
influence and, yes, leverage over these countries. That's how arms sales
have always worked, until Trump flipped the script]{.underline}.

["The White House seems to be saying that Trump Doctrine is that the
U.S. will ignore your human rights abuses, assassinations or war crimes
as long as you buy things from us. He's got it totally and completely
backwards," Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told me.]{.underline} "What's
the point of being a military superpower if we lose leverage when we do
business with another country?"

["What the president doesn't realize is that this makes him look weak
and small. World leaders will now know they can act with impunity so
long as they are buying American weapons. That's an insane message to
send," Murphy said. "The United States should never be boxed in because
of who we sell weapons to --- countries who buy U.S. weapons should feel
enormous pressure to stay on our good side."]{.underline}

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) made a similar point Sunday on CNN's "State of
the Union" with Jake Tapper.

"Arm sales are important, not because of the money, but because it also
provides leverage over their future behavior," he said. "You know ...
they will need our spare parts. They will need our training. And those
are things we can use to influence their behavior."

[Congress does have a role to play in approving arms sales, and all
indications are that they plan to intervene on sales to Riyadh if it is
shown that the Saudi regime had a hand in Khashoggi's death. The State
Department approved a \$15 billion sale of the Terminal High Altitude
Air Defense (THAAD) missile defense system to Saudi Arabia this month.
The Pentagon said last week Saudi Arabia has signed letters of offer or
acceptance of \$14.5 billion worth of American helicopters, tanks,
ships, weapons and training.]{.underline}

[In June, the Senate narrowly voted down a resolution to halt the sale
of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of precision-guided munitions
to the Saudi military out of concern they could be used to target Yemeni
civilians]{.underline}. After the vote, Senate Foreign Relations
Committee ranking Democrat Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said he opposed the
sale, placing it in limbo.

[The threat of congressional action would be more effective if the
president of the United States wasn't publicly undermining Congress's
message,]{.underline} said William Hartung, director of the Arms and
Security Project at the Center for International Policy.

["Trump is not even trying to use this leverage," he said. "He's
completely given it away, and not only that, he's announced to the world
that he's giving it away."]{.underline}

[Through a basic misunderstanding of national security and diplomacy,
the president has once again undermined U.S. interests and made the work
of his own team]{.underline} --- including Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo --- [much more difficult]{.underline}. Thinking of arms sales
purely in dollar terms doesn't make any sense.

#### [Domestic constraints]{.underline} are key to strengthening [human rights]{.underline} and [international law]{.underline}

**Hathaway, Yale Law School professor of International law, 2018** \-\--
(Oona A. Hathaway, Aaron Haviland, Srinath Reddy Kethireddy, and Alyssa
T. Yamamoto, 10 *Harv. Nat\'l Sec*. J. 1, 2018, "Yemen: Is the U.S.
Breaking the Law?," Lexis, DOA: 6-28-2018, NREM)

Yemen is not party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal
Court and therefore the United States support for the coalition\'s
actions\--in possible violation of Article 2(4) and therefore a possible
crime of aggression\--cannot fall within the Court\'s jurisdiction. As a
permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, [the United
States can veto any attempt]{.underline} \[\*63\] [by other countries to
impose UN-enforcement, including mandated sanctions]{.underline}. In
theory, [the United States could face unilateral or coordinated
multilateral economic sanctions by other countries.]{.underline} The
recent decision by Germany to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia (in
response, notably, not to Saudi Arabia\'s actions in Yemen, but rather
its role in the killing of Khashoggi) may open the door to further
sanctions. 341Link to the text of the note For now, however, the
[discussion of sanctions has not included secondary sanctions that would
reach the United States, nor are they connected to the **Saudi-led war
in Yemen**]{.underline}. In any case[, sanctions are likely to begin
with diplomatic overtures to the United States to reduce its support for
the Saudi government.]{.underline}

[The war in Yemen, and the U.S. role in it, reveals the degree to which
**the rule of law**]{.underline}\--[both domestic and
international]{.underline}\--**[relies on a government, and government
officials, committed to the rule of law, for the law to
succeed]{.underline}**. [Sometimes violations of domestic law or
international humanitarian law **brings consequences that states cannot
ignore**]{.underline}, [but most of the time law protecting the rights
of the most **vulnerable depend on states to self-police their own
behavior**]{.underline}. [There are **consequences for failing to do
so**]{.underline}: [When the government violates domestic law\--for
example, ignoring constraints]{.underline} contained in the War Powers
Resolution or the AECA\--[it undermines **public trust in
government**]{.underline}. [And when states **fail to live up to their
international legal obligations**, they **weaken the legal norms** from
which all states benefit.]{.underline}

It is a reminder [that all public law]{.underline}\--that is law the
governs the behavior of state and state actors\--[faces an enforcement
challenge]{.underline}. It is, after all, the state that is meant to
enforce the law. What happens when the law constrains the state? Jack
Goldsmith and Daryl Levinson observe precisely this problem when they
write, \"The puzzle of how a legal regime can coerce the compliance of
states in a world where there is no entity more powerful than the state
thus arises no less urgently in domestic constitutional law than it does
in international law.\" 342Link to the text of the note The answer to
this dilemma is that all public law relies to a significant extent on
self-enforcement: states are not motivated primarily by threat of
external enforcement. They instead rely on \"some combination of
rationally self-interested in normative, internalized, or role-based
motivations.\" 343Link to the text of the note At least part of that
self-interest is commitment to the rule of law\--independent of the
content of a particular law\--itself. [The breakdown here is likely
evidence]{.underline} [of]{.underline} weak\--or at least insufficiently
strong\--[commitment to the norms reflected in the relevant
laws]{.underline}, but also a willingness to erode the rule of law, or
stand by as it is eroded by others, which is much the same thing.

It is an unfortunate reality that [the United States, the nation that
championed the creation of international laws governing human rights,
humanitarian law, and the use of force, and which helped lead the way in
incorporating many of those same commitments into domestic law to
further support and enforce them, has proven reluctant to support the
laws\' robust enforcement]{.underline}. [What is happening in Yemen will
not bring down the international legal order. But **the open violation
of several core norms**]{.underline} [of that legal order that is taking
place in Yemen is a **dangerous sign that those norms are
eroding**]{.underline}. [If law-breaking behavior faces little or no
consequence, over time those laws]{.underline} \[\*64\] **[are drained
of their force and effect.]{.underline}** The **[legitimacy and
long-term viability of the international legal system cannot but suffer
as a result]{.underline}**.

#### US leadership on human rights crucial to address virtually every global threat

**Schnetzer, George w. Bush** **Institute, Global Initiatives fellow,

\[Amanda, George W. Bush Institute, 7/21/16 "Why promoting freedom and
human rights is in our national interest"

Substantially more people experience liberty today than at the end of
World War II, but [more than half the world's population still lives in
countries where basic political rights and civil liberties are only
partly respected, if at all. The last decade in particular has not been
good for freedom.]{.underline}

For ten consecutive years, Freedom House has documented a worrisome
"decline in global freedom[." The National Endowment for Democracy has
warned of authoritarian regimes cracking down at home while also
"seeking to reshape the international order and democratic
norms."]{.underline}

[From China to Russia to the Middle East, the challengers to liberalism
are gaining ground. **It is in the direct and immediate interest of the
United States to help shift the balance by supporting the advance of
human rights** and freedom abroad.]{.underline}

[The current mood in the United States does not appear conducive to this
strategy.]{.underline} New Pew Research polling shows that [69 percent
of Americans believe the United States should "concentrate more on our
own national problems." Seventy percent want the next U.S. president to
focus on domestic policy over foreign policy.]{.underline}

[Yet in order to address the "major threats" that keep Americans awake
at night --- I**SIS, foreign cyberattacks, global economic instability,
the spread of infectious diseases, the refugee crisis** --- **strong
U.S. leadership is required**, as are strategies that help advance rule
of law, good governance, open markets, and other features of free
societies.]{.underline}

So where do we go from here?

[**One step would be for policymakers**, presidential candidates, and
other public office hopefuls **to make** the promotion of democracy and
**human rights an important part of their foreign policy
agendas**.]{.underline} This March, 139 policy experts, civil society
leaders, and former elected officials---Republicans and Democrats
alike---signed a letter encouraging the presidential candidates to do
just that.

[While recognizing that "democracy and human rights cannot be the only
items on the foreign policy agenda," the letter calls it a "false
choice" to pit the pursuit of democratic ideals against national
security]{.underline}. I was proud to sign that letter.

A second step would be to engage the American people in a conversation
about the impact of advancing freedom on our own peace, prosperity, and
security.

At the end of World War II, for example, many questioned whether
democracy was compatible with Germany and Japan. The United States
actively supported the development of democratic institutions and
practices. Today, Germany and Japan are among our strongest partners and
allies in the world, and Americans reap tangible benefits.

In North Texas, where the Bush Institute is located, the relocation of
Toyota's North American headquarters is expected to create jobs and have
an economic impact of \$7 billion in the first ten years, according to
estimates when the move was announced.

[During the Cold War, the United States supported democratic reform in
places like Taiwan, South Korea, the Philippines, and Chile. The end of
the Cold War was a major victory for freedom in Central and Eastern
Europe. After decades of Soviet nuclear threat, it also was a great
victory for American peace and security]{.underline}.

**[Today, the moral and strategic imperatives of advancing human rights
are just as compelling]{.underline}**. In Afghanistan, investing in
women promotes stability and helps reduce the possibility of future
terrorist attacks on the United States emanating from that country[. In
the Middle East, the spread of Islamic extremism and ISIS has had
devastating consequences, and the United States is not
immune]{.underline}. In North Korea, a regime that systematically and
horrifically abuses the rights of its own people seeks nuclear weapons
that can reach our shores.

[In these and other places, it is in the interests of the United States
to see the forces of freedom eventually prevail]{.underline}.

## 1AC Advantage -- Soft Power

#### **Tensions around arms sales to Saudi are high after the murder of Khashoggi and it's hurting global credibility**

**Guay, Penn State International Business Clinical Professor, 2018**

\[Terrence, 10-19-18, The Conversation, "Arms sales to Saudi Arabia give

#### US allies are noticing Saudi Arabia's human right's abuses -- Congress *[must]{.underline}* suspend all arms sales to Saudi Arabia to regain credibility 

**Feinstein, U.S. Senator-California, 2018**

\[Dianne, 10-17-18, MercuryNews, "Opinion: U.S. must act in face of
Saudi human rights violations,"
https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/10/17/opinion-feinstein/, 6-28-19, GDI
LNM\]

[The United States for decades has been a close ally with Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, joining together to beat back Iraqi aggression in
Kuwait and holding in check Iranian meddling in the Middle East. [We
have frequently overlooked many of the kingdom's controversial actions
and policies to maintain our relationship. Today, I believe it's time to
reassess that position]{.underline}.

The recent news that prominent Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi
disappeared after entering Saudi Arabia's consulate in Turkey and was
likely murdered has shocked the world. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and
contributor to the Washington Post, had been critical of Saudi Arabia
and its young crown prince.

[Reports indicate that Saudi Arabia, despite initially stating it was
not involved, may now claim that Khashoggi's death was the result of an
interrogation gone wrong. That explanation is hardly believable.
Instead, his murder fits an ongoing pattern of Saudi human rights abuses
since Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman came to power.]{.underline}

I was concerned when bin Salman pushed his rival Mohammed bin Nayef, a
key partner in the United States' counterterrorism efforts, out to
become crown prince. However, his early economic reforms and efforts to
loosen restrictions on Saudi women sparked hope that he could usher in a
new era of openness.

Unfortunately, that hope was quickly dashed. Under the crown prince's
rule, [Saudi Arabia has repeatedly attacked dissidents at home and sown
discord abroad]{.underline}. Nowhere is this more notable than [in
Yemen]{.underline}, where [Saudi Arabia launched a bombing campaign
three years ago under the pretense that it would bring the Houthis
quickly to heel]{.underline}.

[Since then, the Saudi-led coalition's air campaign has killed
thousands, deliberately targeted medical facilities and destroyed much
of Yemen's civilian infrastructure. Yemen now faces a humanitarian
catastrophe with a major cholera outbreak and millions of people on the
brink of starvation.]{.underline}

[Saudi Arabia's actions in Yemen are not isolated]{.underline}.

[Last year, the crown prince attempted to force the resignation of
Lebanon's Sunni Prime Minister in an apparent effort to check Hezbollah
and Iran.]{.underline} It appears bin Salman believed bringing down
Lebanon's government would benefit Saudi Arabia, despite the violence
and instability that could have ensued in one of the world's most
sensitive flashpoints.

[Our allies have also taken notice of Saudi Arabia's
actions.]{.underline}

[Earlier this year, the crown prince overreacted to Canada's mild
criticism of his decision to jail Saudi women who stood up for their
right to drive by recalling the Saudi ambassador and threatening to cut
economic ties. Prime Minister Trudeau rightly refused to back down and
stood by his nation's condemnation of Saudi Arabia's treatment of
women's rights activists who to this day remain jailed.]{.underline}

[In contrast, President Trump has remained silent in the face of Saudi
abuses again and again]{.underline}. Candidly, I [believe the
president's praise for dictators like Kim Jong Un, Rodrigo Duterte, and
above all, Vladimir Putin, has provided cover for the crown prince's
actions.]{.underline}

[The fact of the matter is that under President Trump, the United States
is no longer a champion of human rights. We no longer defend the freedom
of the press, the freedom of expression or the freedom of religion
abroad, all of which are now under attack in Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}
The president even openly undermines the Geneva Conventions by promoting
torture.

Instead of accepting King Salman and the crown prince's denials without
any evidence or outlandish theories that he was killed by rogue agents,
President Trump should immediately push for an international
investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance and demand justice for
anyone found complicit.

[If the White House continues to refuse to act, Congress must. The first
step would be to reject a pending arms sale to the kingdom and suspend
assistance to the Saudi-led war in Yemen]{.underline}. And we must
seriously consider sanctions against anyone involved in Khashoggi's
disappearance.

[The United States can no longer remain silent in the face of such
brazen human rights violations. Saudi Arabia was once one of our closest
allies in the Middle East. I'm no longer sure that should be the
case.]{.underline}

#### US support for Saudi Arabia decks international credibility -- emboldens rising powers

**Rauhala, Staff writer for foreign affairs, AND Troianovski, Moscow
bureau chief covering Russia**

\[Emily and Anton, Washington Post, 10-19-19, "The world has a question
for the White House: When do murders matter?"
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/19/world-has-question-white-house-when-do-murders-matter/?utm_term=.d94a8e93c13b>
accessed 6-27-19 EO)

For nearly three weeks, the world has watched President Trump downplay
the disappearance and apparent slaying of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,
and waited for the most powerful man in the world to act. They are
waiting still.

**[Trump's inconsistent and cautious remarks about the case have renewed
questions about U.S. credibility and complicated the global response,
emboldening adversaries such as Russia and China and discouraging robust
action by traditional allies, according to analysts and former U.S.
officials.]{.underline}**

"**[This is a drastic break from American practice]{.underline}**," said
Vali R. Nasr, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies. ["It signals a very different foreign policy that does not hold
governments accountable for things that are outside normal legal or
ethical parameters."]{.underline}

"In effect," he added, ["The U.S. is setting a new standard for itself"
---]{.underline} [and in so doing, may be setting a new standard for the
world]{.underline}.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. [Trump this
week denied "giving cover" to the Saudis]{.underline}.

\"I want to find out what happened, where is the fault, and we will
probably know that by the end of the week," he told the media.

Khashoggi, who was born in Saudi Arabia, was a contributing columnist to
The Washington Post and a lived in Virginia. Articles he wrote for The
Post included criticism of Saudi Arabia's government. On Oct. 2, he
entered the country's consulate in Istanbul and never emerged. Turkish
intelligence believes he was killed and dismembered there by Saudi
agents. After denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate, the Saudi
government said Saturday that he was killed during a fistfight in the
consulate.

The alleged assassination comes just months after the attempted
assassination on British soil of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy
who acted as a double agent. It comes just weeks after the Chinese head
of Interpol temporarily disappeared during a trip home.

"We are at a very critical point where authoritarian powers have great
confidence: Russia continues to launch attacks on foreign soil, and now
the Saudis have murdered a journalist in the most barbaric way," said
Nicholas Burns, a professor of the practice of diplomacy and
international relations at Harvard who previously held several senior
diplomatic roles.

**["In a time like that, the U.S. has to signal that we are not going to
tolerate this]{.underline}**," he added, but "[it's been more than two
weeks and there's been no signal."]{.underline}

[Into this void steps Russia, which is using the]{.underline} Khashoggi
[case to call out alleged hypocrisy by Washington and to seek an
advantage in the complex geopolitics of the Middle East.]{.underline}

At a foreign policy conference in Sochi, Russia, on Thursday, President
Vladimir Putin said the Trump administration's cautious response to
Khashoggi's disappearance underlined U.S. double standards.

Putin argued that the West was quick to punish Moscow after the
poisoning of Skripal in May, but acted differently with Khashoggi.
Russia denies involvement in the poisoning, but Western allies levied
sanctions and expelled Russian diplomats. "There's no proof in regards
to Russia, but steps are taken," Putin said.

"Here, people say that a murder happened in Istanbul, but no steps are
taken. A single approach needs to be figured out to these kinds of
problems," he said.

Putin has invested deeply in ties with Riyadh as part of a broader push
to rebuild Russian influence in the Middle East. He hosted King Salman
last year for the first-ever visit to Russia by a Saudi monarch, and
invited Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to join him at the opening
match of the soccer World Cup in June.

On Sunday and Monday, Russian officials, including a deputy foreign
minister, met with the crown prince and other top officials in Riyadh
for talks on the conflict in Syria, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. A
rupture between the United States and Saudi Arabia now could play into

marquee business conference in Saudi Arabia next week, their Russian
counterparts have followed suit. Russia's \$10 billion sovereign wealth

When China is pressed on the disappearance of the head of Interpol, the
detention of human rights campaigners, or the mass internment of the
mostly Muslim ethnic Uighurs in its far northwest, it tells the
international community to respect its sovereignty and butt out.

known for its strident nationalism, argued this week that the Khashoggi

U.S. as insincere in caring about human rights]{.underline}," said

countries and non-state organisations seek to fill a vacuum created by
the dearth of sensible American voices and policies. Such players could
range from economic powerhouses such as China and Germany, seeking, or

### Human Rights - Yemen

#### US support of Saudi Arabia is immoral violates the human rights of yemeni civilians

**Almutawakel, co-founder and leader of Mwatana Organization for Human
Rights, Alfaqih, co-founder and leader of the Mwatana Organization for
Human Rights, 16.** ( Radhya & Abdulrashee, 8-11-2016, \"Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates Are Starving Yemenis to Death,\" Foreign
Policy,

MK )

[Jamal Khashoggi was but the latest victim of a reckless arrogance that
has become the hallmark of Saudi Arabia's foreign policy. Yemenis were
saddened, but not surprised, at the extent of the brutality exhibited
in]{.underline} [Khashoggi's killing, because our country has been
living through this same Saudi brutality for almost four
years.]{.underline}

[As human rights advocates working in Yemen, we are intimately familiar
with the violence, the killing of innocents, and the shredding of
international norms that have been the hallmarks of Saudi Arabia's
military intervention in our country. For nearly four years, Saudi
Arabia has led a coalition, along with the United Arab Emirates, that
has cynically and viciously bombarded Yemen's cities, blockaded Yemen's
ports, and prevented humanitarian aid from reaching millions in
need.]{.underline}

According to the Yemen Data Project, Saudi and Emirati aircraft have
conducted over 18,500 air raids on Yemen since the war began---[an
average of over 14 attacks every day for over 1,300 days. They have
bombed schools, hospitals, homes, markets, factories, roads, farms, and
even historical sites. Tens of thousands of civilians, including
thousands of children, have been killed or maimed by Saudi
airstrikes.]{.underline}

[But the Saudis and Emiratis couldn't continue their bombing campaign in
Yemen without U.S. military support. Saudis and Emiratis couldn't
continue their bombing campaign in Yemen without U.S. military support.
American planes refuel Saudi aircraft en route to their targets, and
Saudi and Emirati pilots drop bombs made in the United States and the
United Kingdom onto Yemeni homes and schools Nevertheless, U.S.
attention to the war in Yemen has been largely confined to brief spats
of outrage over particularly dramatic attacks, like the August school
bus bombing that killed dozens of children.]{.underline}

[Saudi crimes in Yemen are not limited to regular and intentional
bombing of civilians in violation of international humanitarian law. By
escalating the war and destroying essential civilian infrastructure,
Saudi Arabia is also responsible for the tens of thousands of Yemeni
civilians who have died from preventable disease and starvation brought
on by the war. The United Nations concluded that blockades have had
"devastating effects on the civilian population" in Yemen, as Saudi and
Emirati airstrikes have targeted Yemen's food production and
distribution, including the agricultural sector and the fishing
industry.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, the [collapse of Yemen's currency due to the war has
prevented millions of civilians from purchasing the food that exists in
markets. Food prices have skyrocketed, but civil servants haven't
received regular salaries in two years. Yemenis are being starved to
death on purpose, with starvation of civilians used by Saudi Arabia as a
weapon of war.]{.underline}

[Three-quarters of Yemen's population---over 22 million men, women, and
children---are currently dependent on international aid and protection.
The U.N. warned in September that Yemen soon will reach a "tipping
point," beyond which it will be impossible to avoid massive civilian
deaths. Over 8 million people are currently on the verge of starvation,
a figure likely to rise to 14 million---half of the country---by the end
of 2018Over 8 million people are currently on the verge of starvation, a
figure likely to rise to 14 million---half of the country---by the end
of 2018 if the fighting does not subside, import obstructions are not
removed, and the currency is not stabilized.]{.underline}

To be clear, [there is no party in this war is without blood on its
hands; our organization, Mwatana, has documented violations against
civilians by all parties to the conflict in Yemen, not only Saudi
Arabia. The Houthis have killed and injured hundreds of civilians
through their use of landmines and indiscriminate shelling, while
militias backed by the United Arab Emirates, Yemeni government-backed
militias, and Houthi militias have arbitrarily detained, forcibly
disappeared, and tortured civilians. But the de facto immunity that the
international community has given Saudi Arabia through its silence
prevents real justice for violations by all sides.]{.underline}

[The people of the Middle East have long and bitter experience with
international double standards when it comes to human rights, as
purported champions of universal rights in the West regularly ignore
grave violations by their allies in the region, from the former shah of
Iran to Saddam Hussein to Saudi Arabia's current crown prince, Mohammed
bin Salman.]{.underline}

**[This double standard was on display during the crown prince's recent
tour of world capitals and Silicon Valley, where he was generally
praised as a "reformer," and media figures recited his vision for Saudi
Arabia in the year 2030 without asking what will be left of Yemen by the
year 2020 if the war continues.]{.underline}**

[Similarly, this double standard is on display when Western policymakers
downplay Saudi and Emirati violations of Yemenis' human rights by
claiming that a close partnership with Riyadh is needed to prevent
perceived Iranian threats to the international community, without asking
whether that same community is also endangered by Saudi Arabia's daily
violations of basic international norms. And yes, there is a double
standard in the wall-to-wall coverage of Khashoggi's horrific murder,
when the daily murder of Yemenis by Saudi Arabia and other parties to
the conflict in Yemen hardly merits mention.]{.underline}

[Those in the United States and elsewhere who are incensed by
Khashoggi's murder must summon similar moral clarity and condemn Saudi
Arabia's daily killing of innocents in Yemen.Those in the United States
and elsewhere who are incensed by Khashoggi's murder must summon similar
moral clarity and condemn Saudi Arabia's daily killing of innocents in
Yemen. If Saudi violations are to be genuinely curtailed, Khashoggi's
killing must mark the beginning, not the end, of accountability for
Saudi crimes. Khashoggi's death has been reduced to a single data point,
rather than being seen as the result of subverting universal values in
favor of geopolitics or business interests.]{.underline}

[Reversing course---ending U.S. military support for the Saudi-Emirati
intervention in Yemen and supporting U.N.-led peace efforts and the
reopening of Yemen's air and sea ports---can still save millions of
lives.]{.underline}

[If U.S. lawmakers had spoken up and taken action on Yemen years ago,
when Saudi Arabia's rampant violations were already well known,
thousands of Yemeni civilians who since then have been killed by
airstrikes or starvation would still be alive today---and perhaps Jamal
Khashoggi would be, too.]{.underline}

### Internal Link -- for domestic impact

#### Human rights leaderships bolsters soft power and gives the US an incentive to fix domestic problems 

**Aka, Chicago State University Criminal Justice Professor, 2015**

\[Phillip C., July 2015, Akron Law Review, "Analyzing U.S. Commitment to
Socioeconomic Human Rights," Volume: 39, Number 2, page 14-17, GDI LNM\]

[Human rights are a critical source of legitimacy and soft
power]{.underline} (power not based on display of sheer military
strength).81 [Informed assessments affirm that "the only legitimate
state in the modern world is the liberal democratic state that" along
with being "properly elected," also "protects a wide range of
internationally-recognized human rights]{.underline}."82 In the
aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 2001, [the U.S. needs the "moral
authority" that comes with obedience to internationally recognized human
rights to preserve its hegemony]{.underline}.83 As Professor Henkin
reminds us[, international human rights laws and institutions became
necessary because national laws and institutions are never fully
effective]{.underline}.84 As he explains,

[The purpose of international concern with human rights is to make
national rights effective under national laws and through national
institutions. The purpose of international law relating to human rights
and of international human rights institutions is to make national human
rights law and institutions effective instruments for securing and
ensuring human rights.]{.underline} In an ideal world---if national laws
and institutions were fully effective---there would be no need for
international human rights laws and institutions.85

Since we do not live in an ideal world where national laws and
institutions are fully effective, the U.S., like any other country, must
abide by international human rights standards.

2\. [Benefits to the U.S. Human Rights Community]{.underline}

[In addition to the U.S. government, application of international human
rights also immensely benefits the U.S. human rights community. Little
wonder that activists dealing with issues relating to immigrants,
prisoners, the poor, and other minorities are now increasingly using
human rights as a tool of advocacy]{.underline}.86 Commenting on the
strategic utility of the human rights approach, one activist stated,
"[You cannot reduce rights. You either have to hold the line or increase
them."]{.underline}87 The human rights approach affords social justice
activists a chance "to break out of the chokehold of domestic law,"88 as
well as an indispensable "another place to go."89 With more and more
poverty advocacy groups taking the position that "scarcity is not the
issue---greed is,"90 a human rights approach gets "people to think about
economic inequality differently, in terms of rights."91 It "act\[s\] as
a counter to society's unceasing attempt to make poor people think it's
their fault that they can't make it."92 Placing economic and social
needs like a living wage, decent shelter, adequate food, and
life-sustaining health care "within an international human-rights
framework would allow them to be seen . . . as falling squarely within
the categories of rights."93

[Utilizing international human rights standards can also bring important
political rewards that can occur when mobilizing international pressure
results in "the embarrassment of international attention" that then, as
was the case during the 1950s, "provide\[s\] a powerful incentive to the
United States to improve its domestic rights record]{.underline}."94
Finally, ["placing domestic struggles in an international context" can
provide access to critical resources that may "ease the racial and class
tensions that can often frustrate cooperation" in the U.S., such as "the
insights and solidarity of . . . international colleagues," stronger
links that could encourage greater national solidarity, and
conceptualization and implementation of domestic advocacy strategies
that are informed by the experiences of activists
elsewhere]{.underline}.95 The human rights scholar and administrator Gay
McDougall probably had some of these gains in mind when she indicated
that U.S. advocacy groups "need to foster greater awareness that our
rights and realities here \[meaning in the U.S.\] are connected to
what's happening in other countries."96

At a human rights gathering in Chicago in July 2005, speaker after
speaker testified to the utility of the human rights framework for
activist work in fields ranging from poverty to women's health to the
environment.97 Libra Foundation President Susan Pritzker, who opened the
conference, noted that ["\[h\]uman rights as a framework has the power
to transform our activism. The human rights framework has a moral and
ethical power that resonates across barriers and differences. It
provides an alternative to the more narrow view of 'morality' that is
all too pervasive in the U.S. today]{.underline}."98 Participants also
presented evidence to the effect that "[a human rights framework changes
the discussion . . . and opens the door to different outcomes. 'A human
rights framework helps us see and think about issues in a new light,
helps us to determine what is ours by right. And when we talk in those
terms, the discussion changes.'"9]{.underline}9 The human rights
administrator and veteran activist Loretta Ross, commenting on the
necessity for human rights education, alleged interestingly that the
lack of knowledge of international human rights instruments like the
Universal Declaration that prevails among the general population in the
United States occurs because [political leaders "don't want us to know
this stuff, for fear that we might use it. Keeping a human rights
awareness out of public discussion can make it easier for governments to
deny responsibilities and evade accountability]{.underline}."100

### Internal link -- Rising Powers

#### US support for Saudi Arabia decks international credibility -- emboldens rising powers

**Rauhala, Staff writer for foreign affairs, AND Troianovski, Moscow
bureau chief covering Russia**

\[Emily and Anton, Washington Post, 10-19-19, "The world has a question
for the White House: When do murders matter?"

For nearly three weeks, the world has watched President Trump downplay
the disappearance and apparent slaying of journalist Jamal Khashoggi,
and waited for the most powerful man in the world to act. They are
waiting still.

**[Trump's inconsistent and cautious remarks about the case have renewed
questions about U.S. credibility and complicated the global response,
emboldening adversaries such as Russia and China and discouraging robust
action by traditional allies, according to analysts and former U.S.
officials.]{.underline}**

"**[This is a drastic break from American practice]{.underline}**," said
Vali R. Nasr, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies. ["It signals a very different foreign policy that does not hold
governments accountable for things that are outside normal legal or
ethical parameters."]{.underline}

"In effect," he added, ["The U.S. is setting a new standard for itself"
---]{.underline} [and in so doing, may be setting a new standard for the
world]{.underline}.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. [Trump this
week denied "giving cover" to the Saudis]{.underline}.

\"I want to find out what happened, where is the fault, and we will
probably know that by the end of the week," he told the media.

Khashoggi, who was born in Saudi Arabia, was a contributing columnist to
The Washington Post and a lived in Virginia. Articles he wrote for The
Post included criticism of Saudi Arabia's government. On Oct. 2, he
entered the country's consulate in Istanbul and never emerged. Turkish
intelligence believes he was killed and dismembered there by Saudi
agents. After denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate, the Saudi
government said Saturday that he was killed during a fistfight in the
consulate.

The alleged assassination comes just months after the attempted
assassination on British soil of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy
who acted as a double agent. It comes just weeks after the Chinese head
of Interpol temporarily disappeared during a trip home.

"We are at a very critical point where authoritarian powers have great
confidence: Russia continues to launch attacks on foreign soil, and now
the Saudis have murdered a journalist in the most barbaric way," said
Nicholas Burns, a professor of the practice of diplomacy and
international relations at Harvard who previously held several senior
diplomatic roles.

**["In a time like that, the U.S. has to signal that we are not going to
tolerate this]{.underline}**," he added, but "[it's been more than two
weeks and there's been no signal."]{.underline}

[Into this void steps Russia, which is using the]{.underline} Khashoggi
[case to call out alleged hypocrisy by Washington and to seek an
advantage in the complex geopolitics of the Middle East.]{.underline}

At a foreign policy conference in Sochi, Russia, on Thursday, President
Vladimir Putin said the Trump administration's cautious response to
Khashoggi's disappearance underlined U.S. double standards.

Putin argued that the West was quick to punish Moscow after the
poisoning of Skripal in May, but acted differently with Khashoggi.
Russia denies involvement in the poisoning, but Western allies levied
sanctions and expelled Russian diplomats. "There's no proof in regards
to Russia, but steps are taken," Putin said.

"Here, people say that a murder happened in Istanbul, but no steps are
taken. A single approach needs to be figured out to these kinds of
problems," he said.

Putin has invested deeply in ties with Riyadh as part of a broader push
to rebuild Russian influence in the Middle East. He hosted King Salman
last year for the first-ever visit to Russia by a Saudi monarch, and
invited Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to join him at the opening
match of the soccer World Cup in June.

On Sunday and Monday, Russian officials, including a deputy foreign
minister, met with the crown prince and other top officials in Riyadh
for talks on the conflict in Syria, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. A
rupture between the United States and Saudi Arabia now could play into
the Kremlin's hands.

"We first need to wait for the results of the investigation" of
Khashoggi's disappearance, Putin said. "How can we, as Russia, start to
harm our relationship with Saudi Arabia without knowing what really
happened?

While Western officials and business leaders have been dropping out of a

6-27-19, GDI LNM\]

Finally, [U.S. support for democracy and human rights matters in
people's lives. It is true that the United States has been far from
perfect in championing human rights, especially where America has
short-term security interests]{.underline}. [Yet there is no other
country that can substitute for the United States when it comes to
fighting for universal freedoms]{.underline}. [American presidents,
members of Congress, and cabinet secretaries have personally intervened
to get political prisoners released from jail, prevent genocide, and
bring war criminals to justice. The solidarity expressed by U.S.
political and civil leaders has provided sustenance and hope to human
rights defenders in the grimmest conditions]{.underline}. An Egyptian
activist once pulled a speech given by President Barack Obama on the
vital contributions of civil society out of his pocket and said to me,
"When I heard these words, I knew I wasn't alone."

At a moment in which the forces of nationalism, authoritarianism, and
hatred threaten to tear our societies apart again, the United States
needs to make sure that those bravely fighting against repression and
injustice all around the world know that they have not been forgotten.

### Human Rights Leadership solves Great Power Wars

#### Rebuilding human rights-based [governance]{.underline} counters [rising threats]{.underline} \-\-- [Europe]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline}, and [China]{.underline}

After Trump: The U.S. Has Homework to Do,"
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/foreign-policy-after-trump-us-has-homework-do>,
DOA: 6-28-2019, NREM)

[To build sustainable political consensus]{.underline} and to deal with
the world as we will find it in 2021, some [new approaches will be
needed]{.underline}. Internationalists' core values have not
changed---and should not. The interests of American workers and
communities are more effectively, and less expensively, served by the
U.S. acting with partners than alone. **[Rules and norms serve American
interests]{.underline}** [in the long run even if they sometimes
constrain us in the short run]{.underline}.

Here are some questions Americans need to debate and answer before we
are confident we know what foreign policy architecture we should be
telling our fellow citizens, and an anxious world, that we would pursue
if given the chance:

[What is to become of the **great, but weakening,
institutions**]{.underline} [of the 20th century?]{.underline}

As Bruce Jentleson has written, [the institutions that make up the
international order were not in peak form]{.underline} even before 2016.
It is a commonplace to note the dramatic shifts in global economic and
military power since the 1950s and 1990s, but Washington has been slower
to acknowledge that the institutions built in the great waves of
post-World War II and post-Cold War activity have not kept up.

[Consider U.S. partnerships with **Europe**]{.underline} as just one
example. Surely a President Hillary Clinton and her secretary of state
would be struggling to forge an effective partnership with [an EU
**consumed by Brexit**]{.underline} [and **hobbled** by the]{.underline}
emergence of **[nativist and illiberal governments]{.underline}** [in a
number of key member states.]{.underline} The trouble does not end in
the EU. [Turkey]{.underline}'s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, [with an
**autocratic consolidation of power**]{.underline} [and a turn to
**nationalism**]{.underline} at his international partners' expense,
[poses enormous challenges to decades' work of thinking and practice
about how NATO operates]{.underline}---and how the European Union
relates to its neighbors. Under those circumstances, what does it mean
to "restore" NATO or the G20?

The U.N. and Bretton Woods institutions, too, are a mixed bag of good
function, poor function and near non-function. For perhaps a decade,
many of them have been---and still are--- challenged and changed by
so-called "mini-lateralism," coalitions of the willing, and regional
groupings such as China's Belt and Road initiatives. Bedrock documents
of the international system, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, continue to come under challenge. As Anne-Marie Slaughter points
out, much of American thinking and structure when it comes to diplomacy
is built for the world of the chessboard, as diplomacy has traditionally
been described, in which leaders make one move at a time in a flat,
hierarchical system. But, she argues, many innovations in governance
occur, instead, in the networked world of the web, where formal
hierarchies and distinctions between governmental and non-governmental
power are less relevant. [U.S. foreign policy has struggled to be
effective in informal arenas and has repeatedly been out-organized in
recent decades by coalitions of governmental and non-governmental actors
on **issues such as land mines**]{.underline} and climate change.
Post-Trump [policy will need an updated construct of what
multilateralism is, an institution-by-institution assessment of what is
holding up and what not, and a plan that finally **matches lip service
paid to transnational challenges**]{.underline}---[and all with
structures and priorities that deploy the government, business and
citizen power necessary to address them.]{.underline}

What kind of global economic arrangements will best revive and sustain
American communities?

At least before the round of punitive tariffs and counter-tariffs in
recent weeks, there was a strong argument that classic liberalization
had run its course. The ills of some American communities could be best
addressed not by retreating from the world economy but by strengthening
Washington's ability to combat unfair trade effectively (not
unilaterally); by improving the foundations of education, training and
safety nets for workers here; and by harmonizing across our key economic
partners, in ways that would benefit worker, community and environmental
health as well as corporate fiscal health. Elements of such an agenda,
as laid out by Jennifer Harris, Brad Setser, and others, would still
demand vigorous U.S. economic diplomacy---and they assume healthy
international economic institutions, a luxury we may not have by 2021.
But they demand different skills and strategies from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership liberalization model of the last decade. Diplomats might
spend more time building coalitions to enforce existing rules (avoiding
the destabilizing and so far ineffective tit-for-tat tariffs Trump
favors) and less time negotiating new deals. Officials would work
closely with business interests---and with health, environmental and
labor interests---to monitor effects on American priorities.

[What does a return to **great-power competition**]{.underline} [mean in
practice]{.underline}?

[It is no longer controversial to assert]{.underline} that [we are in an
age in which multiple states have enough power to move the global system
in significant ways, and to block, hinder or threaten others outside
their immediate spheres of influence.]{.underline} But the policy
frameworks and [rhetoric that defenders of liberal institutions fall
back on often simply fail to acknowledge these
realities]{.underline}---leaving a gap through which Donald Trump has
effectively driven a wrecking ball. As Rebecca Lissner and Mira
Rapp-Hooper trenchantly ask: "Can an international order be economically
and politically open if its leading states are not liberal?" [The task
of debating, building national consensus for, and clarifying
to]{.underline} **[Moscow]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Beijing]{.underline}** [what Washington's aims toward them
are---where the United States will cooperate and where it will
compete---is a mammoth one on policy grounds alone]{.underline}. Trump's
coded racial rhetoric on trade will further inflame the
always-challenging public conversation on China, even as partisan
polarization has reshaped public opinion on Russia. Policies shaped
primarily by a desire to counter Trump are likely to suffer some of the
same failings.

[What is the role of force in achieving American ends?]{.underline}

Every recent secretary of defense from James Mattis back to Robert Gates
has called for more funding for diplomacy and development
assistance---as, of course, has every secretary of state and
administrator of USAID. Yet [the desire since 9/11 to respond to voters'
security anxieties by **increasing defense spending has driven the
pendulum**]{.underline} the other way, [and the Trump administration's
**ideological opposition** to some of the core functions of **civilian
international relations compounds that trend**]{.underline}. [Without
articulating an **ethical and political doctrine**]{.underline}---and
one that sounds credible to voters and foreign leaders alike---on when
it is appropriate to use force, [any]{.underline} new [president is
doomed to languish in this cycle find herself trying to solve political
problems with blunt military tools and risk American lives in the
process.]{.underline}

An unpleasant but necessary parallel question is what model the
reconstruction of the State Department and USAID should take in a world
where many of their cherished practices are outmoded. Decades of
underfunding and diminished influence will not be easily reversed. This
structural challenge inevitably takes the backseat to policy crises a
new administration may face---but it needs to be considered
thoughtfully, with congressional leaders, before it's too late.

Where do values fit in the exercise of American power?

[The idea that American values play a key role in U.S. policy has been
under attack for years now,]{.underline} as millennials left skeptical
after growing up during the Iraq War swelled the ranks of both leftists
and realists who insisted the U.S. had either no right or no business
impinging on other nations' sovereignty. Yet those critiques leave aside
one of the most important outgrowths of the 20th century's web of
institutions and norms: the emergence of non-governmental powers---from
a globally coordinated movement to counter climate change, to Chinese
Falun Gong supporters who converge by the thousands on Western capitals,
to the activists who egged governments into negotiating a treaty to ban
landmines---that demands more and better observation of norms, holding
governments and even superpowers to account. The United States---like
every other great power in history---frequently sought to evade or
flat-out ignore the norms it played a core role in establishing. But the
nature of the liberal order meant that non-governmental elements were
able, in a limited and imperfect but real way, to call it and others to
account.

That job has gotten harder in recent years. [The move of **illiberal
governments like China** into the role of **defender of the
international order makes it harder still**]{.underline}. So will years
of [Washington withdrawing from international commitments and augmenting
past hypocrisies with aggressive and even proud **embrace of
authoritarian regimes**]{.underline}. [Working with other governments
and private entities to **redefine a human rights role**]{.underline}
[for the U.S. will require patience, flexibility and
humility]{.underline}---not always our forte. Washington may find our
new circumstances suit a behind-the-scenes role, which will sit
uncomfortably for the generation of human-rights defenders who expect to
see Americans at the front of every barricade.

## Framing

### Human Rights 1st

#### Human rights comes first 

**Aka, Chicago State University Criminal Justice Professor, 2015**

\[Phillip C., July 2015, Akron Law Review, "Analyzing U.S. Commitment to
Socioeconomic Human Rights," Volume: 39, Number 2, page 14-17, GDI LNM\]

2\. [Benefits to the U.S. Human Rights Community]{.underline}

[In addition to the U.S. government, application of international human
rights also immensely benefits the U.S. human rights community. Little
wonder that activists dealing with issues relating to immigrants,
prisoners, the poor, and other minorities are now increasingly using
human rights as a tool of advocacy]{.underline}.86 Commenting on the
strategic utility of the human rights approach, one activist stated,
"[You cannot reduce rights. You either have to hold the line or increase
them."]{.underline}87 The human rights approach affords social justice
activists a chance "to break out of the chokehold of domestic law,"88 as
well as an indispensable "another place to go."89 With more and more
poverty advocacy groups taking the position that "scarcity is not the
issue---greed is,"90 a human rights approach gets "people to think about
economic inequality differently, in terms of rights."91 It "act\[s\] as
a counter to society's unceasing attempt to make poor people think it's
their fault that they can't make it."92 Placing economic and social
needs like a living wage, decent shelter, adequate food, and
life-sustaining health care "within an international human-rights
framework would allow them to be seen . . . as falling squarely within
the categories of rights."93

[Utilizing international human rights standards can also bring important
political rewards that can occur when mobilizing international pressure
results in "the embarrassment of international attention" that then, as
was the case during the 1950s, "provide\[s\] a powerful incentive to the
United States to improve its domestic rights record]{.underline}."94
Finally, ["placing domestic struggles in an international context" can
provide access to critical resources that may "ease the racial and class
tensions that can often frustrate cooperation" in the U.S., such as "the
insights and solidarity of . . . international colleagues," stronger
links that could encourage greater national solidarity, and
conceptualization and implementation of domestic advocacy strategies
that are informed by the experiences of activists
elsewhere]{.underline}.95 The human rights scholar and administrator Gay
McDougall probably had some of these gains in mind when she indicated
that U.S. advocacy groups "need to foster greater awareness that our
rights and realities here \[meaning in the U.S.\] are connected to
what's happening in other countries."96

At a human rights gathering in Chicago in July 2005, speaker after
speaker testified to the utility of the human rights framework for
activist work in fields ranging from poverty to women's health to the
environment.97 Libra Foundation President Susan Pritzker, who opened the
conference, noted that ["\[h\]uman rights as a framework has the power
to transform our activism. The human rights framework has a moral and
ethical power that resonates across barriers and differences. It
provides an alternative to the more narrow view of 'morality' that is
all too pervasive in the U.S. today]{.underline}."98 Participants also
presented evidence to the effect that "[a human rights framework changes
the discussion . . . and opens the door to different outcomes. 'A human
rights framework helps us see and think about issues in a new light,
helps us to determine what is ours by right. And when we talk in those
terms, the discussion changes.'"9]{.underline}9 The human rights
administrator and veteran activist Loretta Ross, commenting on the
necessity for human rights education, alleged interestingly that the
lack of knowledge of international human rights instruments like the
Universal Declaration that prevails among the general population in the
United States occurs because [political leaders "don't want us to know
this stuff, for fear that we might use it. Keeping a human rights
awareness out of public discussion can make it easier for governments to
deny responsibilities and evade accountability]{.underline}."100

### Human Rights \> Allies

#### U.S. must ban Saudi arms sales to restore credibility -- human rights comes before regional allies

**Koteiche, Middle East and North Africa Researcher, '19**

\[Rayan, 6-3-19, Physicians For Human Rights, "The Deadly Price of U.S.
"Emergency" Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia,"
https://phr.org/resources/the-deadly-price-of-u-s-emergency-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/,
6-29-19, GDI-LNM\]

[The Trump administration has unapologetically supported the Saudi
involvement in Yemen despite the staggering human toll it has inflicted
on that country's civilian population. By announcing its plan to bypass
Congress with an "emergency" provision to the Arms Export Control Act,
the administration has opted for a legally dubious measure to circumvent
the constitutional authority of a bipartisan Congress]{.underline} which
stands in opposition to such sales. [The weapons sold by the United
States government to members of the coalition help perpetuate the
conflict and the unlawful attacks on civilians and health facilities
that define it. The Trump administration should prioritize the lives of
Yemeni civilians over blind support for perceived regional allies who
are shredding international norms by pursuing a conflict in Yemen that
is characterized by a grisly litany of war crimes.]{.underline}
[Suspending armament sales to Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, and their
allies will send an overdue message that the Trump administration will
no longer be complicit in the criminality of the Yemen conflict. Failure
to do so will relegate the United States to the status of an enabler of
the ongoing depredation of Yemen and the death of thousands of its
civilians.]{.underline}

## A2: Disads

### A2 -- Fill In Disad -- moral argument

#### who cares about potential fill in \-\-- morality and ethics outweigh 

**Sanchez, Geopolitical Researcher, 2019**

\[W. Alejandro, 4-2-19, Providence Magazine, "Should the US Sell Weapons
to States That Commit Human Rights Violations?"
https://providencemag.com/2019/04/should-us-sell-weapons-states-human-rights-violations/,
6-27-19, GDI LNM\]

[Weapons sales to Saudi Arabia have been particularly criticized due to
Riyadh's campaign in Yemen, in which countless civilians have lost their
lives.]{.underline} Moreover, [Riyadh was also involved in the murder of
Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey last year]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [even non-lethal equipment can be utilized to commit human
rights abuses]{.underline}. For example, the US has donated J8 jeeps
(among other equipment) to the Guatemalan military to improve internal
security operations. Unfortunately, President Jimmy Morales has deployed
his troops to harass the CICIG (International Commission against
Impunity in Guatemala), and US diplomats have been reportedly intimated,
too. In response, several members of the US Congress wrote a letter to
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in December 2018 to "urge the Department
to take effective steps to ensure that this situation be rectified."

[Critics]{.underline} of S.854 can [argue that such sales are important
for the US weapons industry, which encompasses tens of thousands of
jobs, and that if Washington does not sell them, someone else
will]{.underline}. Indeed, SIPRI explains that [the major weapons
exporters after the US are Russia, France, Germany, China, and the UK,
in that descending order. However, the fact that other states are
willing to sell their military technology to a government known for
committing human rights abuses and other atrocities may be a financial
argument, but it is not a moral one. There are already precedents
regarding this issue: Germany has suspended sales to Saudi Arabia over
Yemen, though Berlin reportedly wants to restart them.]{.underline}

S.854 is an attempt to improve the monitoring of US weapons transfers to
states that are proven human rights abusers or that support violent
criminal movements. As Win Without War's Kizer argues, "[providing
weapons to countries that violate human rights, perpetrate war crimes,
and other violations of the rule of law is not in US national security
interests.]{.underline} S.854 recognizes this reality and ensures that
there are clear moral and national security considerations upheld in US
arms exports."

## A2: Kritiks

### A2: Imperialism 

#### Using imperialism as a blanket term over all US interventions on the basis of human rights justifies suffering under the mask of cultural relativism 

**Ahmari, Co-editor of Re-Orient, Palgrave MacMillan\'s forthcoming
anthology of essays by young Arab and Iranian democrats, 2011**

\[Sohrab, 1-4-11, The Guardian, "Beware those who sneer at \'human
rights imperialism\',"
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/libertycentral/2011/jan/04/human-rights-imperialism,
7-2-19, GDI LNM\]

[At the height of the crackdown against the Hungarian uprising in 1956,
Albert Camus warned French leftists not to allow political \"expediency
any precedence over regard for truth\". The western left that ignored
or, worse, justified the suffocation of Budapest, Camus thundered, \"is
in complete decadence, a prisoner of words, caught in its own
vocabulary, capable of merely stereotyped replies, constantly at a loss
when faced with the truth, from which it nevertheless claimed to derive
its laws]{.underline}\".

[Today]{.underline} -- with a century of catastrophic lapses in judgment
in hindsight -- [too many western progressives are still trapped by the
same \"systematic relativism\" that, in Camus\'s time as in ours,
threatens no less than the \"death of intelligence]{.underline}\".

[Take]{.underline} historian and journalist Stephen [Kinzer\'s recent
intervention against]{.underline} what he calls [\"human rights
imperialism]{.underline}\". Restaging one of the illiberal left\'s
favourite shibboleths, [he argues that the modern human rights movement
has become \"the vanguard of a new form of imperialism\". Human rights
groups,]{.underline} Kinzer sneers, [are \"spear-carrier\[s\] for the
\'exceptionalist\' belief that the west has a providential right to
intervene wherever in the world it wishes\".]{.underline}

[Because it wields tremendous influence on the world stage, the human
rights community should be closely examined to ensure compliance with
its noble founding ideals. For example, the movement is reproached by
many -- and rightly so -- for often subjecting free societies
constitutionally committed to protecting citizens\' rights to more
exacting scrutiny than states genetically engineered for
repression.]{.underline}

[But Kinzer\'s critique of groups such as Human Rights Watch is of an
altogether different variety. Although couched in the rhetoric of a
world-weary pragmatism, Kinzer\'s challenge to human rights groups comes
from a place of fundamental, philosophical hostility. The community,
Kinzer claims, is mistakenly \"promot\[ing\] an absolutist view of human
rights permeated by modern western ideas that westerners mistakenly call
\'universal\'.\"]{.underline}

[And worse, instead of focusing on \"group rights\", the human rights
imperialists fetishise certain \"secondary rights\" such as free speech
and political liberty.]{.underline} (Kinzer cleverly frames these as
\"the right to form a radical newspaper or an extremist political
party\".) [When it comes to human rights in developing countries, Kinzer
seems to be saying, individual rights are irrelevant.]{.underline} \"The
question should not be whether a particular leader or regime violates
western-conceived standards of human rights,\" he says. \"Instead, it
should be whether a leader or regime, in totality, is making life better
or worse for ordinary people.\"

[At first sight, Kinzer\'s argument might strike some as eminently
reasonable. After all, who would want to promote extremist political
parties at the expense of economic development benefiting impoverished
nations? But recall the unassailable fact that in the long term, those
nations that have denied their citizens individual liberty in the name
of collective prosperity have far more often than not failed miserably
at delivering the latter.]{.underline} (The North Korean, Cuban and
Zimbabwean economic miracles are not just around the corner.)

[But it is Kinzer\'s extreme cultural relativism that makes his argument
against the human rights community particularly troubling.]{.underline}
For [he is effectively implying that some people deserve fewer
individual rights than others. There is no universal standard. And how
dare the poor in underdeveloped and developing countries expect to speak
their minds or fulfil their political aspirations -- how egocentric of
them to abdicate their historical destinies in favour of such narrow
ends as reproductive rights and religious liberty.]{.underline}

Kinzer is clearly aware of the fact he is treading on dangerous ground
and playing with ideas with toxic pedigrees. [Perhaps it is for this
reason that he is compelled to attach the predicate \"western\" to every
individual right. Yet one wonders how he accounts for the myriad
indigenous movements from the heart of the \"east\" (whatever that
means) calling for freedom of speech and assembly, gender equity, LGBT
rights, and so on. Are Iran\'s Green and Sudan\'s Girifna movements
human rights imperialists? And pro-democracy Bahraini bloggers and
Tunisian cyberactivists too?]{.underline}

[Imagine what Kinzer\'s proposals would mean in practical terms. Can
human rights activists be expected to ignore the plight of a woman being
stoned in Iran for adultery or a journalist tortured in Mubarak\'s
jails? (\"Terribly sorry, but we wouldn\'t want to judge your oppressors
by the meter of our culturally determined, imperialistic standards --
tough!\")]{.underline}

[And consider, too, the impact of this brand of relativism on the moral
imagination of the left, which, at its very best, stood firm on the
principle that people divided by geography, culture and language can
empathise with and express solidarity with each other.]{.underline}

[If the isolationist, provincial left manages to convince us that the
blessing of liberty is to be allocated randomly -- along geographic
lines and according to the accident of birth -- will the heart still
beat on the left?]{.underline}

### AT: Human Rights are Western

#### Human rights promotion is not a Western notion rather a modern tool necessary in all state societies to protect individual rights 

**Amine, Georgetown University Department of Government political theory
assistant professor, 2016**

\[Loubna El, 4-2-16, Washington Post, "Are 'democracy' and 'human
rights' Western colonial exports? No. Here's why,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/02/are-democracy-andhuman-rights-western-colonial-exports-no-heres-why/,
7-2-19, GDI LNM\]

In September 2014, students in Hong Kong gathered in a public square to
protest some of the Beijing government's legislative initiatives. One of
their slogans was, "When dictatorship becomes a reality, revolution is a
duty," a declaration attributed to Victor Hugo. During the Arab Spring,
protesters in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria raised such slogans
as: "The people want the overthrow of the regime," "Bread, freedom,
social justice" and "The revolution of dignity and freedom."

[Some academics and public intellectuals who study non-Western
societies, worried about imposing Western values, have expressed concern
about the use of categories such as human rights and liberal democracy.
They have instead favored drawing on non-Western societies' own
intellectual traditions and lived experiences.]{.underline} Thus, the
academic debate about the form of government that China should adopt has
focused on drawing from the ideals of Confucianism.

Yet [the slogans raised by the protesters are eminently familiar; they
might well have been deployed in any other country, whether Greece,
France, Ukraine or indeed the United States. Protesters in Hong Kong did
not mention Confucianism at all]{.underline}, prompting one commentator
on a prominent Chinese and comparative-philosophy blog to ask, "Where
are all the Confucians ... tonight?"

[If Western categories ought to be rejected in favor of non-Western
ones, as these academics tell us, what should we make of the fact that
protesters on the ground continue to cling to the former in a very
familiar way, explicitly demanding rights, including women's rights,
equality, elections and the rule of law? The familiarity of the
protesters' slogans is important and telling.]{.underline}

The slogans are familiar not because of superficial resemblances between
modes of activism across the world that somehow mask deep intellectual
disagreements. Rather, [they are familiar because the situation to which
they are a response is familiar: a state using extensive and arbitrary
power.]{.underline}

It would have been odd for protesters in Hong Kong to advocate for the
Chinese government's return to Confucian rituals, or for crowds in
Cairo's the streets to demand a return to the Islamic dhimmi system,
which left minorities free to pursue private religious practices while
being otherwise excluded from political life. These scenarios are
implausible, if not impossible, not because Confucian rituals and the
dhimmi system are ineffective in themselves but because they don't match
modern realities[. To fight a modern state, to constrain rulers and
protect minorities, one needs more appropriate tools.]{.underline}

In a new article, I argue that [these tools are precisely the so-called
Western ideals of which some academics are skeptical: democracy, rights
and the rule of law.]{.underline} [These should be understood not as
Western, but as modern: normative tools particularly suited to the
realities of political life under the sovereign state, the central
institution of modern politics.]{.underline}

[Sovereign states centralize politics and impose a monopoly on the use
of force in a way that pre-modern empires could not, and did not. The
only protection against the risk that states will abuse their power is
to make the government accountable to its people and protect the
inviolability of human life. In other words, demand democracy and
rights. Non-Western states now have the same essential features of
sovereignty as Western ones. And so their citizens can protect
themselves only by fighting for these ideals, and their intellectuals
can support these citizens' efforts only by advocating for these
ideals.]{.underline}

[This is not to deny that many critics around the world denounce human
rights and democracy as Western impositions]{.underline}. Their
proposals, whether building on Latin American, African, Middle Eastern,
Asian or various Western traditions, typically contend that the state
should intervene more, rather than less, in society. They argue that the
state should provide for social welfare, defend a particular view of the
good life or act on religious maxims.

[However, to justify themselves to the public, these arguments also
inevitably build in guarantees against abuse, legally limiting the use
of state power and requiring states to consult with the people, usually
through elections. These guarantees dominate the debate between
advocates and opponents of these proposals. Even when there is a desire
to get away from democracy and human rights, the conversation ends up
centering on them and whether to accept them, to what extent and in what
form.]{.underline}

Efforts to provide Islamic variants on democracy or Confucian variants
on rights thus should be understood not as alternatives to modern
ideals, but as variants on them. This is just as it should be. Just as
there are differences between the democratic systems of Germany and the
United States, so too would a democratic China and a democratic Yemen be
different, both from each other and from the U.S. and German models.
Crucially, [these differences are not between East and West but among
different countries with different material realities.]{.underline}

[For a non-Western conception of government to completely avoid
generating appeals to democracy and rights, it would need to reject
these without simply calling for the extension of the power of the
sovereign state]{.underline}. The Islamic State, by rejecting state
borders and harking back to a pre-modern caliphate system, is trying to
do precisely this. But as the group conquers territory and rules people,
it will have to start acting like a state. In fact, it already is.

And once the Islamic State does act like a state, we can expect its
subjects to start demanding rights, laws and other limits on state
action. Their demands might be couched in religious language, but the
debate will become more and more recognizable as a debate about the
limits of state power, rather than as a debate internal to Islam.

In short, [when citizens in non-Western countries clamor for democracy,
there is no reason to suspect elitism or Western manipulation or false
consciousness. Not everything familiar is a sign of cultural
imperialism. This is not to deny that power differentials continue to
structure the relationship between the West and the East, but rather to
suggest that overcoming the discourse of "us" and "them" will open up
more promising avenues for responding to domination.]{.underline}

### AT: Hypocrisy

#### Hypocrisy isn't great but we shouldn't ignore the good things the U.S. does with its leadership -- its better than doing nothing

**Koh, Yale Law School dean and Gerald C. and Bernice Latrobe Smith
International Law Professor, 2003**

\[Harold Hongju, May 2003, Stanford Law Review, "On America\'s Double
Standard," Volume: 55,
https://prospect.org/article/americas-double-standard, GDI LNM\]

[Double standards are the negative face of American exceptionalism.
There is, however, another, much-overlooked dimension in which the
United States is genuinely exceptional in international affairs: namely
in its exceptional global leadership and activism.]{.underline}
[Experience teaches that when the United States leads on human rights,
from Nuremberg to Kosovo, other countries follow. When the United States
does not lead, often nothing happens \-- or, worse yet, as in Rwanda and
Bosnia, disasters occur because the United States does not get
involved.]{.underline}

[Let me illustrate with an anecdote from my childhood,]{.underline} the
story that made me want to be a human-rights lawyer. [My late father,
Kwang Lim Koh, served as minister to the United States for the first
democratically elected government in South Korea. In 1961, a military
coup overthrew the democratic government of Prime Minister Chang Myon,
who was placed under house arrest amid rumors that he would shortly be
executed. To plead for Chang\'s life, my parents brought his teenaged
son to see Walt Rostow, then the deputy national-security adviser to the
president.]{.underline} As my father recalled, [Rostow turned to the boy
and told him simply, "We know where your father is. Let me assure you,
he will not be harmed."]{.underline}

[Rostow\'s words stunned my father, who simply could not believe that
any country could have such global power, reach, and interest. It was
only after I entered the State Department that I saw that what I had
thought had been exceptional behavior is, in fact, standard American
diplomatic practice.]{.underline} Yet ironically, as I grew older, I
came to realize that this canonical story was inherently double-edged.
The United States was ready to intervene to save Prime Minister Chang\'s
life, but not to take the additional steps necessary to restore
democracy in South Korea. Instead, for several decades, the United
States supported a military government that achieved political stability
through authoritarian rule, a story that became all too familiar
throughout the Cold War era.

What this taught me is that [human-rights problems often arise when the
United States does not exercise its exceptional leadership in human
rights. If critics of American exceptionalism too often repeat, "America
is the problem, America is the problem," they will overlook the
occasions where America is not the problem, it is the solution \-- and
if America is not the solution, there simply won\'t be a
solution.]{.underline}

[Consider Afghanistan]{.underline}, to cite just one example. [In 2002,
the United States led an extraordinarily swift and successful military
campaign to oust the Taliban so that a democracy could be created in
Afghanistan. But what then?]{.underline} [In Bosnia, the United States
famously "went in heavy" after the Dayton Accords, supporting the entry
of 60,000 NATO peacekeepers, including some 20,000 Americans. But in
Afghanistan, a significantly larger geographical area, the United States
has committed fewer troops to peacekeeping and called for only a small
fraction of the international peacekeepers that were sent to Bosnia. The
predictable result: While Hamid Karzai nominally acts as president of
Afghanistan, outside of Kabul, much of the country remains under the de
facto control of warlords and drug lords. Yet instead of making the
additional financial commitments necessary to secure Afghanistan and
promote serious nation building, the administration initially allocated
zero dollars in its 2004 budget for Afghan reconstruction (until
embarrassed congressional staffers finally wrote in a paltry line item
of \$300 million to cover the oversight). To date, U.S. and other
international donors have advanced less than half the sums they
originally pledged for Afghan reconstruction.]{.underline}

In this case, as in others, my policy prescriptions may be
controversial, but my broader point should not be: [American
exceptionalism has both good and bad faces, and we should be aware of
both. The greatest tragedy is when America\'s "bad exceptionalism," its
support for double standards, undermines its ability to engage in "good
exceptionalism," or exceptional human-rights leadership.]{.underline}

## A2: Counterplans

### A2: Human Rights Condition CP

#### Unconditional reductions will increase U.S. leverage and credibility to spur larger global efforts

**Thrall, George Mason University Policy & Government Prodessor &
Dorminey, CATO Policy Analyst 18** (A. Trevor Thrall and Caroline
Dorminey, 3/13, "Risky Business: The Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign
Policy,"
<https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy>,
accessed on 4/30/19, JMP)

The Case for a New Approach

So far we have argued that arms sales lack a compelling strategic
justification, amplify risks, and generate a host of unintended negative
consequences. These factors alone argue for significantly curtailing the
arms trade. But the case for doing so is made even stronger by the fact
that [greatly reducing arms sales would]{.underline} also
[produce]{.underline} two significant benefits for the United States
that cannot otherwise be enjoyed.

The first benefit from reducing arms sales would be **[greater
diplomatic flexibility and leverage]{.underline}**. [Critics might argue
that even if arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will
eliminate a potential source of leverage.]{.underline} We argue that,
**[on the contrary, the diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will
outweigh the potential leverage or other benefits from arms
sales]{.underline}**. Most importantly, [by refraining from arming
nations engaged in conflict, the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [will have the diplomatic flexibility to engage
with all parties as an honest broker]{.underline}. The inherent
difficulty of negotiating while arming one side is obvious today with
respect to North and South Korea. After decades of U.S. support for
South Korea, North Korea clearly does not trust the United States.
Similarly, U.S. attempts to help negotiate a peace deal between the
Israelis and Palestinians have long been complicated by American support
for Israel. [To stop arming one side of a contentious relationship is
not to suggest that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [does not have a preferred outcome]{.underline}
in such cases. Rather, **[by staying out of the military domain
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[can more readily encourage dialogue and diplomacy]{.underline}**.

Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy even in cases
where the United States has an entrenched interest. In the case of
Taiwan, for example, though it is clear that Taiwan needs to purchase
weapons from other countries to provide for its defense, those weapons
do not have to be made in the United States. Having Taiwan buy from
other suppliers would help defuse U.S.-China tensions. Even if Taiwan's
defenses remained robust, China would clearly prefer a situation in
which American arms no longer signal an implicit promise to fight on
Taiwan's behalf. This could also promote more productive U.S.-China
diplomacy in general, as well as greater stability in the Pacific
region. Most important, breaking off arms sales would also reduce the
likelihood of the United States becoming entangled in a future conflict
between Taiwan and China.

The second major benefit of **[reducing arms sales]{.underline}** is
that it **[would imbue the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[with greater moral authority]{.underline}**.
Today, [as the leading arms-dealing nation in the world,
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[lacks credibility in discussions of arms control and
nonproliferation]{.underline}, especially in light of its military
interventionism since 2001. [By showing the world that it is ready to
choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [would provide a huge
boost to international efforts to curtail proliferation]{.underline} and
its negative consequences. This is important because the United States
has pursued and will continue to pursue a wide range of arms control and
nonproliferation objectives. The United States is a signatory of
treaties dealing with weapons of mass destruction, missile technology,
land mines, and cluster munitions, not to mention the flow of
conventional weapons of all kinds. **[The effectiveness
of]{.underline}** these **[treaties, and the ability to create more
effective and enduring arms control and nonproliferation
frameworks]{.underline}**, however, **[depends on how the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[behaves]{.underline}**.

This is not to say that unilateral American action will put an end to
the problems of the global arms trade. States would still seek to ensure
their security and survival through deterrence and military strength.
Other weapons suppliers would, in the short run, certainly race to meet
the demand. But [history shows that global nonproliferation treaties and
weapons bans typically **require great-power support**]{.underline}. In
1969, for example, Richard [Nixon decided to shutter the American
offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international
ban]{.underline} on such weapons. [By 1972 the]{.underline}

[Thanks to the separation of powers within the U.S. government, no one
foreign policy camp could accrue too much influence. When the Nixon
White House pursued a strictly realpolitik approach toward the Soviet
Union, Congress forced human rights concerns onto the
agenda.]{.underline} [When the Obama administration was leery of
sanctioning Iran's central bank, congressional hawks forced it to take
more aggressive action.]{.underline} [Time and time again, U.S. foreign
policy reverted to the mean. Overreaching was eventually followed by
restraint. Buck-passing led to leading]{.underline}. [The results of
these crosscutting pressures were far from perfect, but they ensured
that U.S. foreign policy did not deviate too far from the status quo.
Past commitments remained credible into the future.]{.underline}

[For decades, these dynamics, global and domestic, kept crises from
becoming cataclysmic. U.S. foreign policy kept swinging back into
equilibrium.]{.underline} So what has changed? Today, there is no more
equilibrium, and the structural pillars of American power are starting
to buckle.

THE NEW NORMAL

[Despite the remarkable consistency of U.S. foreign policy, behind the
scenes, some elements of American power were starting to
decline]{.underline}. [**As measured by purchasing power parity, the
United States stopped being the largest economy in the world a few years
ago**. Its command of the global commons has weakened as China's and
Russia's asymmetric capabilities have improved]{.underline}. [The
accumulation of "forever wars" and low-intensity conflicts has taxed the
United States' armed forces.]{.underline}

[Outward consistency also masked the dysfunction that was afflicting the
domestic checks on U.S. foreign policy. For starters**, public opinion
has ceased to act as a real constraint on decisionmakers.**
Paradoxically, the very things that have ensured U.S. national
security--- geographic isolation and overwhelming power---have also led
most Americans to not think about foreign policy,]{.underline} and
rationally so. [The trend began with the switch to an all-volunteer
military, in 1973, which allowed most of the public to stop caring about
vital questions of war and peace.]{.underline} [The apathy has only
grown since the end of the Cold War, and today, poll after poll reveals
that Americans rarely, if ever, base their vote on foreign policy
considerations.]{.underline}

[The marketplace of ideas has broken down]{.underline}, too. [The
barriers to entry for harebrained foreign policy schemes have fallen
away as Americans' trust in experts has eroded]{.underline}. Today, the
United States is in the midst of a debate about whether a wall along its
southern border should be made of concrete, have seethrough slats, or be
solar-powered. [The ability of experts to kill bad ideas isn't what it
used to be. The cognoscenti might believe that their informed opinions
can steady the hands of successive administrations, but they are
operating in hostile territory.]{.underline}

To be fair, the hostility to foreign policy experts is not without
cause. The interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya were massive
screwups. Despite what the experts predicted, globalization has not
transformed China into a Jeffersonian democracy. The supposedly
infallible advice enshrined in the Washington consensus ended up
triggering multiple financial crises. Economists and foreign affairs
advisers advocated austerity, despite the pain it caused the poor and
the middle class, and consistently cried wolf about an increase in
interest rates that has yet to come. No wonder both Barack Obama and
Trump have taken such pleasure in bashing the Washington establishment.

[**Institutional checks on the president's foreign policy prerogatives
have also deteriorated**---primarily because the other branches of
government have voluntarily surrendered them.]{.underline} [The passage
of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which exacerbated the Great
Depression, showed that Congress could not responsibly execute its
constitutional responsibilities on trade]{.underline}. With [the 1934
Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, it delegated many of those powers to
the president, marking the beginning of a sustained decline in
congressional oversight]{.underline}. More recently, **[political
polarization has rendered Congress a dysfunctional, petulant mess,
encouraging]{.underline}** **[successive administrations to enhance the
powers of the executive branch]{.underline}**. [Nor has the judicial
branch acted as much of an impediment. The Supreme Court has
persistently deferred to the president on matters of national
security]{.underline}, as it did in 2018 when it ruled in favor of the
Trump administration's travel ban.

[Foreign policy analysts largely celebrated this concentration of power
in the executive branch, and prior to Trump, their logic seemed
solid]{.underline}. They pointed to the public's ignorance of and
Congress' lack of interest in international relations[. As political
gridlock and polarization took hold, elected Democrats and Republicans
viewed foreign policy as merely a plaything for the next election. And
so most foreign policy elites viewed the president as the last adult in
the room]{.underline}

What they failed to plan for was the election of a president who
displays the emotional and intellectual maturity of a toddler. As a
candidate, Trump gloried in beating up on foreign policy experts,
asserting that he could get better results by relying on his gut. As
president, he has governed mostly by tantrum. He has insulted and
bullied U.S. allies. He has launched trade wars that have accomplished
little beyond hurting the U.S. economy. He has said that he trusts
Russian President Vladimir Putin more than his own intelligence
briefers. His administration has withdrawn from an array of multilateral
agreements and badmouthed the institutions that remain. The repeated
attacks on the eu and nato represent a bigger strategic mistake than the
invasion of Iraq. In multiple instances, his handpicked foreign policy
advisers have attempted to lock in decisions before the president can
sabotage them with an impulsive tweet. Even when his administration has
had the germ of a valid idea, Trump has executed the resulting policy
shifts in the most ham-handed manner imaginable

[Most of these foreign policy moves have been controversial,
counterproductive, and perfectly legal. The same steps that empowered
the president to create foreign policy have permitted Trump to destroy
what his predecessors spent decades preserving. The other branches of
government endowed the White House with the foreign policy equivalent of
a Ferrari; the current occupant has acted like a child playing with a
toy car, convinced that he is operating in a land of
make-believe]{.underline}

[After Trump, a new president will no doubt try to restore sanity to
U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. [Surely, he or she will reverse the
travel ban, halt the hostile rhetoric toward long-standing allies, and
end the attacks on the world trading system. These **patches will miss
the deeper problem,** however]{.underline}. **[Political polarization
has eroded the notion that presidents need to govern from the
center]{.underline}**. [Trump has eviscerated that idea. The odds are
decent that a left-wing populist will replace the current president, and
then an archconservative will replace that president.]{.underline} [The
weak constraints on the executive branch will only make things
worse]{.underline}. [Congress has evinced little interest in playing a
constructive role when it comes to foreign policy. The public is still
checked out on world politics. The combination of worn-down guardrails
and presidents emerging from the ends of the political spectrum may well
whipsaw U.S. foreign policy between "America first" and a new Second
International. **The very concept of a consistent, durable grand
strategy will not be sustainable**]{.underline}

**[In that event, only the credulous will consider U.S. commitments
credible]{.underline}**. [Alliances will fray, and other countries will
find it easier to flout global norms. All the while, the scars of the
Trump administration will linger.]{.underline} [The vagaries of the
current administration have already forced a mass exodus of senior
diplomats from the State Department]{.underline}. That human capital
will be difficult to replace. For the past two years, the number of
[international students who have enrolled in U.S. university degree
programs has fallen as nativism has grown louder. It will take a while
to convince foreigners that this was a temporary spasm]{.underline}.
[After the Trump administration withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, it
forced]{.underline} s w i f t , [the privatesector network that
facilitates international financial transactions, to comply with
unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran]{.underline}, [spurring China,
France, Germany, Russia, and the United Kingdom to create an alternative
payment system]{.underline}. That means little right now, but **[in the
long run, both U.S. allies and U.S. rivals will learn to avoid relying
on the dollar]{.underline}**.

Perhaps [most important, the Trump administration has unilaterally
surrendered the set of ideals that guided U.S. policymakers
for]{.underline} [decades. It is entirely proper to debate how much the
United States should prioritize the promotion of human rights,
democracy, and the rule of law across the world.]{.underline} [What
should be beyond debate, however, is that it is worthwhile to promote
those values overseas and enshrine them at home. Trump's ugly rhetoric
makes a mockery of those values. **Although a future president might
sound better on these issues, both allies and rivals will remember the
current moment**. The seeds of doubt have been planted, and they will
one day sprout]{.underline}

[The factors that give the United States an advantage in the
international system---deep capital markets, liberal ideas, world-class
higher education---have winner-take-all dynamics. Other actors will be
reluctant to switch away from the dollar, Wall Street, democracy, and
the Ivy League. These sectors can withstand a few hits. Excessive use of
financial statecraft, alliances with overseas populists, or prolonged
bouts of antiimmigrant hysteria, however, will force even close allies
to start thinking about alternatives]{.underline}. The American
advantage in these areas will go bankrupt much like Mike Campbell in The
Sun Also Rises did: "gradually and then suddenly[." Right now, the
United States' Jenga tower is still standing. Remove a few more blocks,
however, and the wobbling will become noticeable to the unaided
eye]{.underline}

What would collapse look like? The United States would remain a great
power, of course, but it would be an ordinary and less rich one. On an
increasing number of issues, [U.S. preferences would carry minimal
weight, as China and Europe coordinated on a different set of rules.
Persistent domestic political polarization would encourage Middle
Eastern allies, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, to line up
with Republicans and European allies, such as Germany and the United
Kingdom, to back Democrats. [**The continued absence of any coherent
grand strategy** would leave Latin America vulnerable to a new Great
Game as other great powers vied for influence there. Demographic
pressures would tax the United States, and the productivity slowdown
would make those pressures even worse. Trade blocs would sap global
economic growth; reduced interdependence would increase the likelihood
of a great-power war. Climate change would be mitigated nationally
rather than internationally, leaving almost everyone worse
off.]{.underline}

Joseph [Nye's concept of "soft power]{.underline}" seems to belong to
the same category insofar as it [does not understand power simply in
terms of resources but as actual influence, and includes nonmaterial
sources]{.underline}. And yet [Nye's use is more ambivalent and at times
differs in an important way.]{.underline}

[Nye's concept of soft power is akin to attraction and consensus, and
used for pointing to the legitimacy component of power]{.underline}.
Just as Susan Strange's reconceptualisation of power as "structural
power", which included a knowledge structure comprising technology and
culture44, [Nye formulated "soft power" as a reaction against the US
decline debate of the 1980s]{.underline}.45 But [even in his most recent
statement of it, there is a tendency to analyse soft power in terms of
objective resources]{.underline} [("objective measure of potential soft
power]{.underline}"46), [based on the relative number of US movies,
patents, high-level universities, etcetera]{.underline}. Now, [stressing
the difference between resources and influence, he does note that some
(popular) cultural items, even if diffused, do not imply a political
stance in favour of the US. Also, he gives three different sources of
soft power in culture, national values and foreign policy]{.underline}.
But, or so the argument can be read, si[nce the US has strong resources
in culture, and is allegedly leading the West in terms of values, better
public **diplomacy becomes the only crucial variable for actual US
attractiveness**]{.underline} - and Anti-Americanism the default
residual variable, should it fail. The real value of the other resources
is more or less taken for granted.

**[That means that the focus of the power analysis does not really
engage with the social and intersubjective component of
legitimacy]{.underline}**, [but slides into a classical conversion
failures study so much criticised earlier by Baldwin in the wake of the
Vietnam war.]{.underline} [When allegedly overriding power seemed not to
translate into influence, that was not because the US lacked sufficient
power, but because of conversion failures (lacking political will, that
liberal press backstabbing, etc.).]{.underline} Hence, [we have again
the curious finding that the same outcome can be explained by opposite
causes (power or powerlessness). The problem here is not just
indeterminacy. It is what Baldwin called the "paradox of unrealized
power**" which makes power analysis unfalsifiable and
arbitrary**]{.underline}. [The value of resources is ultimately
objectified and all misfits in terms of influence are explained away via
incompetent agency: **power resources never fail, only politicians
do.**]{.underline}

[Soft power can be read to apply this logic to the issue of legitimacy:
soft power resources never fail, only public diplomacy
does]{.underline}. It then falls short of taking the social and
intersubjective component of legitimacy into account, as Reus-Smit
rightly notes.47 Reminding the US administration that a clever lion
knows when to be fox could miss the point. If [one takes power
seriously, then one would have to look at the problem not just in terms
of the packaging]{.underline} (public diplomacy)48, [but more
fundamentally of the content, i.e. the legitimacy of the US specific
American vision and project of the international order (not to be
confounded with the wider Western, let alone the liberal or the
democratic project).]{.underline}

### No Internal Link -- Soft Power Resilient

#### Soft power is robust and resilient 

**Nye, Harvard University Distinguished Service Professor, political
scientist, 19**

\[JOSEPH S., co-founder of the international relations theory of
neoliberalism, developed in their 1977 book Power and Interdependence,
fellow of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences and a foreign fellow
of The British Academy, pioneered the theory of soft power, former Dean
of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, Gulf
News, 2-9-18, "America's soft power is robust and resilient"
<https://gulfnews.com/opinion/op-eds/americas-soft-power-is-robust-and-resilient-1.2170982>
accessed 6-30-19 EO\]

[The evidence is clear. America's soft power has been eroded. Only 30
per cent of the people recently polled by Gallup in 134 countries held a
favourable view of the United States under President Donald Trump's
leadership --- a drop of almost 20 points since the Barack Obama
presidency.]{.underline} The Pew Research Center found that China, with
30 per cent approval ratings, had reached near-parity with the US. And a
British index, The Soft Power 30, showed America slipping from first
place in 2016 to third place last year.

[Some sceptics reply that soft power does not matter]{.underline}.
Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, proclaimed a "hard power budget"
as he slashed funds for the State Department and the US Agency for
International Development by 30 per cent. [For promoters of "America
First", what the rest of the world thinks ranks second. Are they
right?]{.underline}

Soft power rests on attraction rather than payment. It co-opts people
rather than coerces them. At the personal level, wise parents know that
their power will be greater and will last longer if they model sound
ethical values for their children, rather than relying only on
spankings, allowances, or taking away the car keys.

Similarly, [political leaders have long understood the power that comes
from being able to set the agenda and determine the framework of a
debate. If I can get you to want to do what I want, then I do not have
to force you to do what you do not want. If the US represents values
that others want to follow, it can economise on sticks and
carrots]{.underline}. Added to hard power, attraction can be a force
multiplier.

[A country's soft power comes primarily from three sources: Its culture
(when it is attractive to others), its political values such as
democracy and human rights (when it lives up to them), and its policies
(when they are seen as legitimate because they are framed with some
humility and awareness of others' interests.) How a government behaves
at home (for example, protecting a free press), in international
institutions (consulting others and multilateralism), and in foreign
policy (promoting development and human rights) can affect others by the
influence of its example.]{.underline} In all of these areas, Trump has
reversed attractive American policies.

[**Fortunately, America is more than the government**. Unlike hard-power
assets (such as armed forces), many soft-power resources are separate
from the government and are only partly responsive to its
purposes]{.underline}. In a liberal society, [the absence of official
cultural policies can itself be a source of attraction]{.underline}.
Hollywood movies like The Post, which showcase independent women and
press freedom, can attract others. [So, too, can the charitable work of
US foundations or the benefits of freedom of inquiry at American
universities]{.underline}.

[It is true that firms, universities, foundations and other
non-governmental groups develop soft power of their own which may
reinforce or be at odds with the US foreign policy goals]{.underline}.
And **[all of these private sources of soft power are likely to become
increasingly important in the global information age.]{.underline}**
That is all the more reason for governments to make sure that their own
actions and policies create and reinforce rather than undercut and
squander their soft power.

Domestic or foreign policies that appear hypocritical, arrogant,
indifferent to others' views, or based on a narrow conception of
national interests can undermine soft power. For example, the steep
decline in the attractiveness of the US in opinion polls conducted after
the invasion of Iraq in 2003 were a reaction to the George W. Bush
administration and its policies, rather than to the US generally.

[The Iraq War was not the first government policy that made the US
unpopular.]{.underline} [In the 1970s, many people around the world
objected to the US war in Vietnam, and America's global standing
reflected the unpopularity of that policy. **When** the policy changed
and the **memories of the war receded**, the US recovered much of its
lost soft power]{.underline}. [Similarly, in the aftermath of the Iraq
war**, the US managed to recover much of its soft power in most regions
of the world.**]{.underline}

### No Impact -- Liberal World Order Dead

#### Trump erodes soft power which delegitimizes the U.S. -- he opts for military solutions. 

**Parmar, Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics, and
Political Sociology at the University of London, 2018** ( Inderjeet,
February 15^th^ 2018, OUPblog, "The US led liberal international order
is in crisis,
<https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/us-liberal-international-order-crisis-trump/>,
June 28^th^ 2019, MK )

[**One year into President Trump's administration serious questions are
being asked about the nature and extent of the 'crisis' of the US-led
liberal order**, and its hegemonic state. The most fervent proponents of
that order -- liberal internationalists -- are in varying states of
despair. According to their Whiggish narratives, the order was supposed
to be open, universal, prosperous for most, and integrative. After the
Cold War's end, the triumph of liberalism seemed all but certain. Though
success bred its own international challenges, liberals were ready for
them. China, India, and the rest of the BRICS, not to mention South
Korea, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey (until recently), among others,
continue to be seen as success stories of the order. Despite dark
Realist mutterings of inevitable military conflict between extant and
rising hegemons, liberal optimism remained. **Until November
2016.**]{.underline}

What is most shocking to liberals is that the significant threat appears
to be at 'home', i.e., in the western heartlands: First, Britain voted
to 'Brexit' the EU; then Trump defeated liberal-order champion Hillary
Clinton. For the first time since 1945, a US President won office by
attacking the principal relationships that are the very sinews of
established order -- NATO, American Middle eastern policy, East Asian
security treaties.

[**President Trump's "America First" foreign policy and a governing
style favouring illiberal and racialized authoritarian-populism, rather
than tolerance and diversity,** is narrowing American identity around
the macho (angry) white male, being restored after decades of
'humiliation' at the hands of "usurpers." Women's rights, civil rights,
immigrants, and liberal elite social engineering that 'emasculated' the
American white man, tampered with the constitution and under the banner
of diversity changed the very face of America.]{.underline}

[The 'other' is a Muslim, refugee, terrorist, Mexican immigrant, the
unwanted African and Haitian -- when the immigrants Trump wants look
like Norwegians, a position applauded by white supremacists. A recent
Gallup poll shows the effects -- collapse in America's global approval
from 48% in 2016 to 30% today, just above Russia, slightly behind China
and significantly trailing Germany (43%).]{.underline}

[The levels of social and economic inequality at home -- alongside the
crisis of 'immigration' and forced migration -- much of it driven by
war, poverty and military violence -- makes a lethal political cocktail
that has bred and encouraged leaders promoting right-wing xenophobic
populism, challenging liberal norms.]{.underline}

[Yet, those crises may have been predictable given fault-lines
fundamental to the liberal order. Some are inherent in an expansionist
liberalism -- spreading its democracy and market economics across the
world, creating its own competitors and challengers in the process,
leaving nowhere for American and other western states to export their
crises.]{.underline}

[Other crises occurred because the promise of the liberal order was
unequally shared. The liberal world order turned out to be the West plus
Japan and pro-US South Korea. Large parts of the 'periphery' (across
Asia, Africa, and Latin America, for example) did not share in the
liberals' bounty. That post-1945 era sublimated its colonial-era
racialized-imperial impulse -- embedded in the distribution of power
within international institutions and the terms of trade, as well as the
extraordinary violence during the North American-Western European 'long
peace.']{.underline}

**[For the first time since 1945, a US President won office by attacking
the principal relationships that are the very sinews of established
order -- NATO, American Middle eastern policy, East Asian security
treaties.]{.underline}**

[Yet the western 'fix' in the 1970s to the challenge of post-colonial
nations' demands for a New International Economic Order -- leading to
the export of capital to the global south through loans and investment
in 'middle class' third world states, not only created competitors but
also aided the industrial job-destruction process kick-started by
automation: rust belt areas lost jobs and suffered socially. White
working and middle classes drifted politically towards the Republicans,
whose subliminal racialized appeals -- against 'reverse discrimination',
for example, nurtured a grievance at loss of position, viewed as others
gaining unfair advantages over 'real' Americans. The seeds of the Trump
triumph of 2016 were sown in the decline of the postwar social contract
that initially fueled Reaganism -- and small government and low taxes
conservatism. The wages of whiteness however delivered little in
material terms to Reagan Democrats. And combined with globalization and
automation, their living standards fell, along with other large swathes
of American society, as corporate wealth and political power
increased.]{.underline}

[President Trump's 'principled realism' -- sketched out in his inaugural
address through the speech to the UN General Assembly in September, to
his first National Security Strategy of December 2017, and General
Mattis's National Defense Strategy of January 2017 -- is unilateral,
selectively internationalist, and heavily militarized. It is also
extractive, transactional, and based on American hard power. Trumpism is
a kind of social Darwinism: unregulated corporate power with militarized
policing at home; armed and dangerous states abroad eschewing diplomacy,
loosening the bonds of international norms, underpinned by a
survival-of-the-fittest mentality.]{.underline}

[As his support erodes in practically all parts of the electorate, the
legitimacy of American political and financial elite declines, and
America's global standing slips below China's, Trump is pursuing a more
militarist strategy against China and Russia -- which he has labelled
'revisionist' powers, and closing down diplomatic pathways in dealing
with major global crises. The growing threat of war, the downgrading of
diplomacy and extolling the virtues of a global 'national awakening',
augurs ill for the future of world politics, with strong undertones of
worship of 'strength', 'nation' and 'God'.]{.underline}

[**There is little room for soft power in Trump's foreign policy;
diplomacy has been side-lined in favor of military solutions.** And
America's attitude to international organizations is ambivalent. Thus
far, however, the effects have not fundamentally altered the
international order -- but President Trump's withdrawal of the United
States from the Paris Climate Accord, UNESCO, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, and selective engagement with other international
institutions suggests a loosening of the international order created by
Anglo-American power after World War II.]{.underline}

[The title of a major report for discussion at the January 2018 meetings
at Davos, based on a survey of global elite opinion, is ominous for the
future of the international system: "Fractures, Fears and Failures." The
report's subheadings include: "Grim Reaping," "The Death of Trade,"
"Democracy Buckles," "Precision Extinction", "Into the Abyss", "Fears of

[It seems that **the liberal international order**, a system of rules
and institutions that brought peace and prosperity to the world in the
aftermath of World War II**, [is
now](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/end-of-liberal-world-order-by-richard-n--haass-2018-03)
"being challenged as never before in its 70-year
history**]{.underline}." [Examples of this

[challenge](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/opinion/sunday/trump-china-america-first.html)
can be seen around the globe: Trump is threatening to destroy NAFTA.
Russia is resurgent, annexing Crimea and menacing the Baltic states.
**Democratic values are on the decline in Eastern Europe, with Poland
and Hungary slipping toward autocracy**.]{.underline} China flouts the
rules of the World Trade Organization and Britain is on the verge of
leaving the European Union. Worst of all, in the Middle East a brutal
dictator uses chemical weapons with impunity[. As these examples make
clear, though**, the international order at risk today isn't quite as
old as we think.**]{.underline} [**As late as 1988, there was no
NAFTA.** **Ukraine and the Baltic states were firmly under Russian
control**]{.underline}**. [Poland and Hungary were communist
dictatorships. China hadn't joined the World Trade Organization and what
is now the European Union had yet to adopt such key features as a common
currency and visa free travel]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} Saddam
Hussein was using chemical weapons not just with impunity but with tacit
[American
support](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/08/26/exclusive-cia-files-prove-america-helped-saddam-as-he-gassed-iran/).
[**And even in the last three decades, the liberal international order
was not as robust as we'd like to imagine. For example, the ongoing
humanitarian tragedy in Syria has generated
[poignant](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-08/the-american-century-is-over-putin-and-assad-killed-it)
[laments](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/04/syria-chemical-weapons-assad-trump/557483/)
for a vanished era when such horrors wouldn't have been permitted**.
**By this standard, though, the golden age of the international order
lasted just a few years, from Washington's successful 1999 intervention
in Kosovo to its unsuccessful 2003 intervention in Iraq**]{.underline}.
Or, measured differently, from the time **[Bill Clinton sincerely
[apologized](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/text-of-clintons-rwanda-speech/)
for not stopping the genocide in Rwanda]{.underline}** up until the
moment it became clear George W. Bush [wasn't prepared
to](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/28/AR2007102801704_3.html?sid=ST2007102801732)
stop the genocide unfolding in Darfur**. [Of course, even its most
ardent admirers would readily admit that the liberal international order
was always more of an aspiration than a consolidated, 70-year-old
achievement]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} And the optimism that
accompanied the end of the Cold War has been widely [derided for some
time
now.](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&client=firefox-b-1-ab&biw=961&bih=520&ei=V9omW46AOIaL5wKhv5O4Bg&q=%22the+end+of+the+end+of+history%22&oq=%22the+end+of+the+end+of+history%25)
[**Yet there was still a surprisingly hardy assumption that up until
recently** **the world was moving, however slowly or erratically, in the
right direction**. If nothing else, there appeared to be a trajectory
toward greater order that has now become impossible to discern. This in
itself is excellent cause for alarm**. If the liberal order was always
an arduous and incremental work in progress, it is all the more likely
that progress could come apart**]{.underline}**.** Similarly, if what
order exists today only came about through the efforts of successive
presidential administrations, the arrival of a president without the
desire or competence to sustain this achievement is even more
frightening. And gratuitously alienating allies is never a good idea.
[**But it would be a mistake to react to this rising alarm with
[nostalgia](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/world-imagined-nostalgia-liberal-order#full)
for an era of global order that [never
was](https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-make-trumps-national-security-strategy/#essay3).
Watching the president abandon the rhetoric and ambition that, [however
imperfectly](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-foreign-policy.html),
sustained American policy seems to have led observers to double down on
historical myths**.]{.underline} The temptation to invoke romanticized
history in an effort to avert disaster is entirely understandable.
[**But it comes at the expense of accurately diagnosing the
contradictions of the previous policy consensus and having a candid
discussion of how we got where we are today. Which then makes it harder
to build something stronger in the aftermath of the crises we are
experiencing**. In fact, many of the questions up for debate today are
the ones policymakers
[debated](https://tnsr.org/2018/02/choosing-primacy-u-s-strategy-global-order-dawn-post-cold-war-era-2/)
in the 1990s -- when U.S. power and the optimism for a new international
order were at their peak. In championing the liberal order, U.S.
politicians were always loath to admit that there were ever trade-offs
between America's interests and the world's, or that they had sometimes
broken the very rules they promoted.]{.underline} Yet beneath this
rhetoric there were still real arguments that now risk being lost in the
nostalgia: [**Would the liberal order be American-led or
American-dominated? Would America follow the rules or make them? How
could countries like China and Russia be convinced to accept the terms
of an American order?** And out of what combination of idealism and
self-interest would the American people be convinced to
[support](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Hell-America-Age-Genocide/dp/1455879991)
this [whole
endeavor](https://www.amazon.com/War-Time-Peace-Clinton-Generals/dp/0743223233)
anyway?]{.underline} Well before Trump, U[.S. foreign policy had to
navigate between rival critiques, from Americans insisting that the
international order was a hopelessly idealistic project with little in
it for them and foreign critics who saw it as a euphemism for American
hegemony]{.underline}. Partisan debates aside, past presidents never
received an outpouring of popular support when contemplating
intervention in the
[Balkans](https://warontherocks.com/2016/10/the-arc-of-history-is-long-but-it-bends-toward-bombing-assad/),
or
[Syria](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/world/middleeast/syria.html),
or anywhere else where they couldn't articulate a clear threat to
American security. Similarly, there was never a consensus, even in
Washington, on how to respond to Russian aggression against non-allies
situated on the periphery of Western institutions, whether Georgia in
2008 or Ukraine in [2014. It was, in other words, far from clear that
voters were willing to shoulder the cost of compelling countries like
Russia to accept the version of the international order that the United
States was offering them. In pushing confidently ahead with a
geopolitical project that saw its success peak in the year 2000,
policymakers were bound to run into trouble eventually. Appeals to an
idealized past serve to bolster the argument that if only the president
-- Obama, Trump, or both, depending on your politics -- had not
abandoned America's [commitment to global
leadership](https://warontherocks.com/2017/12/traditions-quiet-victories-trumps-national-security-strategy/)
the world's current crises could have been avoided. The implicit premise
is that were Washington to recommit to its previous foreign policy
vision, the world would fall in line. Difficult disagreements about
matching America's geopolitical ambitions to its resources would resolve
themselves without any insurmountable objections from voters or foreign
leaders. Syria's civil war could be resolved like Bosnia's eventually
was, rather than any one of the countless other civil wars Washington
couldn't, or didn't ever attempt to, solve. One need not know the
solutions to these challenges to see that they won't be found in
recreating a short-lived moment of post-Cold War confidence. Figuring
out what [comes
next](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/20/america-is-having-a-middle-eastern-identity-crisis/)
requires looking at the recent past as a cautionary tale as well as a
template. And recognizing that, whatever [solutions
emerge](https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/day-after-trump-american-strategy-new-international-order),
they will almost certainly prove more compelling -- both at home and
abroad -- presented as a revised vision for a more stable and just world
than as a return to an era whose virtues are more apparent to op-ed
writers than anyone else.]{.underline}

### Turn -- imperialism

On the campaign trail Donald Trump explicitly threatened the status quo.
He denounced allies as delinquent and threatened to shred alliances,
tolerate nuclear proliferation, re-erect tariff walls, and abandon
international agreements[. To security traditionalists who oppose Trump,
his revisionist challenge accelerates the collapse of a "liberal order"
under a transnational assault by authoritarian forces]{.underline}. In a
state of shock, they seek orientation in an ahistorical myth about the
world before this dark age. As Princeton's Aaron Friedberg tweeted,
"[After WWII US built a system of democratic states, tied together by
trade, institutions and common values --- a liberal order. Now it needs
to defend that order against the illiberal powers it tried to
incorporate after the Cold War."]{.underline}9 Historian [Jeremy Suri
charges that Trump is plunging the world into a great regression by
"launching a direct attack on the liberal international order that
really made America great."]{.underline} [**The elements of this order
include "a system of multilateral trade and alliances that we built to
serve our interests and attract others to our way of life**." Suri
explains:]{.underline}

Through the European Recovery Program (the Marshall Plan), the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank, among other
institutions, [the United States led a postwar capitalist system that
raised global standards of living, defeated Soviet communism, and
converted China to a market economy]{.underline}. [Through the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]{.underline} [in Europe and a web of
alliances in Asia and the Middle East, the United States contained
aggressive states, nurtured stable allies, and promoted democratic
reforms when possible]{.underline}.10

**[This sunny "highlights package" offers a strangely bloodless
retelling of history]{.underline}**. It is [a euphemistic rendering of
the Cold War and the actual practice of anti-Soviet containment by the
superpower and its proxies]{.underline}. The Bay of Pigs, napalm, East
Timor, the shah of Iran, and the Contras fade into the background. [That
this pristine retelling should come from distinguished historians of
American diplomacy like Friedberg and Suri suggests how seductive the
vision of an earlier and better order has become. **Trump, too, is
complicit in this mythmaking**]{.underline}. Like his opponents, [he
frames his own election in stark terms]{.underline}. [Trump speaks of a
dark prehistory of "globalism," of open borders, predatory capitalism,
futile wars, and general American victimhood, and a return to wholesome
nationalism, industrial regeneration, civilizational rebirth, and, of
course, making America "great]{.underline}."11

**[What was the liberal order, as its defenders define
it]{.underline}**? [If an "order" is a coming together of power with
social purpose, a "world order" is an international design of
institutions, norms, and patterned relationships that defines the global
balance of power.]{.underline}12 [Some commentators argue that for a
viable world order to emerge in a time of turbulence, the United States
may have to compromise]{.underline}. Amitav Acharya, Michael Mazarr, and
Henry Kissinger seek to revive the concept of world order, but [unlike
those of other "world order" visionaries, their proposed designs are
pluralistic and require the United States to temper its universalism for
the sake of stability and negotiated coexistence in a polycentric
world]{.underline}.13

By contrast, [the liberal order is a missionary project that looks to
extirpate rival orders and demands the perpetuation of American
dominance]{.underline}. As an ideal type, [the "liberal order" entails a
copious number of norms and institutions, suggesting that good things go
together. In accounts of the postwar liberal order, many or all of the
following features appear, though with varying emphasis: the rule of law
and the supremacy of "rules," humanist globalism and humanitarian
development, free trade, multilateral cooperation, the security
provision of the United States]{.underline} (principally through its
permanent alliances), [and a commitment to liberal progress through the
advocacy of democratic and market reforms]{.underline}. Its institutions
span the United Nations, NATO, the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (followed by the World Trade Organization), the IMF,
and the World Bank. A commitment to protocols and the bridging of
divides figure centrally. Hence phrases like "open, rule-based
international economy" abound.14 [The "order," proponents argue,
embodied also a pattern of behavior, or, as Jake Sullivan at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace explains, a "system of norms,
institutions, and partnerships" whereby, under the hegemon's
stewardship, collective cooperation trumped competition for relative
advantage, significant shares of sovereignty were ceded for the benefits
of collective action, and a global consensus spread]{.underline}.15 [An
"illiberal order" would presumably be the opposite of these things:
politically and economically divided and closed, authoritarian,
uncooperative, coercive, and disrespectful of rules and
norms.]{.underline}

**[The liberal order is necessarily hierarchical]{.underline}**. [To
speak of liberal order is to speak also of American primacy, with the
former depending on the exercise of the latter]{.underline}.
[Nostalgists do not deny that the American superpower upheld it partly
through overwhelming military strength]{.underline}. However,
[they]{.underline} [emphasize the nonbloody uses of force, for example,
deterring and dissuading adversaries, reassuring and uniting allies, and
preventing conflict]{.underline}. And [they stress the consensual,
attractive quality of American hegemony.]{.underline} Postwar
continental Europe therefore stands out as a favorite area of emphasis,
as an "empire by invitation."16

[Most anxious observers agree that a significant "fall" is
occurring]{.underline}.17 To explain it, [they weigh heavily an alleged
loss of political will within the West.]{.underline} Leading [theorists
of liberal order, such as Princeton's G. John Ikenberry, have long
warned that "the hallmarks of liberal internationalism --- openness and
rule-based relations enshrined in institutions such as the United
Nations and norms such as multilateralism --- could give way to a more
contested and fragmented system of blocs, spheres of influence,
mercantilist networks, and regional rivalries]{.underline}."18 Once
optimistic that the order would withstand geopolitical challenges and
prove resilient, [Ikenberry]{.underline} now [fears]{.underline} a
different kind of insurgent threat, flowing not from hostile subversive
states but from within. [Working- and middle-class
populations]{.underline}, he suggests, [may lose faith in the order as
democracy degenerates]{.underline}.19

Similar complaints have arisen across the Atlantic. Warnings against
U.S. disengagement are a staple of rhetoric from security thinkers in
allied countries.20 For Robin Niblett, director of the internationalist
Chatham House, Trump replicates and feeds on the destructive forces that
powered "Brexit," forcing liberalism into retreat.21 For the University
of Exeter's Doug Stokes, as for Ikenberry and Niblett, domestic
discontent may unravel the worldwide arrangements that best served
America's "globalized" interests. For the old order to reproduce itself,
it must make a new settlement with the American working class.22

Most of these diagnoses have a common premise. All offer an upbeat,
potted history of the world created in and after 1945. [Many then blame
the crumbling of that world on agents or forces that are separate from
it]{.underline}.**[23 If the order is perishing, they argue, it is being
assassinated rather than dying from its internal
failures]{.underline}**. **[They have little to say about the
significant reverses that occurred while the order
reigned]{.underline}**. [These included some of America's most
disastrous wars, geopolitical chaos in the Persian Gulf from the
Iran-Iraq War to the present sectarian breakdown, resurgent jihadi
Islamism, the greatest act of urban terrorism committed by a nonstate
actor in history, the eurozone crisis, the economic regression of Russia
under "shock therapy," mounting and unsustainable debt, the global
financial crisis, the entrenchment and immobility of wealth, and the
growing underclass of working poor]{.underline}. [Rather than
attributing to the old order the failures that occurred on its watch,
nostalgists blame mismanagement, or popular fatigue, or "populism" and
demagogues that whipped up mass discontent]{.underline}. They give
credit to the order and U.S. primacy for benign developments,
discounting other possible contributors such as the deterrent effects of
nuclear weapons or the memory of World War II. [That the order may have
been complicit in its own undoing is hardly considered.]{.underline}

[Nostalgia for a lost order is not just the complaint of self-styled
liberal internationalists of any particular faction. It has a wider
provenance among those who believe today's choice lies between
continuing American primacy and chaos.]{.underline} [The strength of the
consensus is reflected in a Brookings Institution paper, coauthored by
former high-ranking officials in the administrations of George W. Bush
and Barack Obama]{.underline}, [urging the White House to revert to a
traditional posture, upholding an order **favoring** **openness, human
rights, and peace,** and claiming that this is the only viable grand
strategy for the United States]{.underline}.24 The hawkish intellectual
Robert Kagan argues that the order established after World War II was a
"liberal enlightenment project" that is now "challenged by forces from
within and without," not only because of popular fatigue with the
burdens of international leadership but because Americans have forgotten
the reasons their country adopted the role as the world's guarantor and
stabilizer.25 Primacists such as Robert Lieber, Thomas Wright, and Eliot
Cohen issue similar warnings.26

The prominence of neoconservatives among this chorus is ironic. Critics
once accused neoconservatives of violating the principles of liberal
order with their bellicose unilateralism, by agitating for preventive
war in Iraq in March 2003 without an explicit UN mandate, and by
justifying torture. But this reflects the paradoxical problem at the
heart of liberal "world ordering." [On the one hand, under most popular
visions of liberal order, the hegemon creates a world based on deference
to institutions and rules. But actual international life includes
hostile, noncooperative forces that refuse to defer]{.underline}. Thus
[the liberal order includes conflicting rather than complementary rules
and principles. It contains "veto players" like Russia or China with
different conceptions of order.]{.underline} [The protection and
enforcement of such an order, and the enforcer's own preponderance,
rests upon selection and the exercise of a hegemon's
privilege.]{.underline}

[Liberal world orders typically involve several impulses, namely,
internationalism, integration, and imperialism]{.underline}.27 [That
last, imperialism, is the most contentious]{.underline}. Historically,
world orders, with their trading protocols and monetary regimes, and
control of sea lanes, commercial routes, and access to raw materials,
are designed and imposed by the strong. The opening of Asian markets, a
celebrated feature of liberal order, was also a pre-1945 byproduct of
violent and imperial coercion, imposed on China by Great Britain through
the Opium Wars and on Japan by American Commodore Matthew Perry with the
threat of naval bombardment in 1853-1854.

[Proponents of liberal order occasionally admit that what is sometimes
framed straightforwardly as a rule-bound order is in fact a system of
imperial power (and vigilante privilege) exercised by a
hegemon]{.underline}. Robert Cooper, the former diplomat and adviser to
Prime Minister Tony Blair, argued [that if the world had a civilized
core that deserved lawful conduct, there was also a barbarous periphery
that warranted "rougher methods of an earlier era."]{.underline}28
"Among themselves," he wrote, "[the postmodern states operate on the
basis of laws and open co-operative security" but "in the jungle, one
must use the laws of the jungle]{.underline}."29 One-time advocate of
American empire Michael Ignatieff admitted that [being an imperial power
"means enforcing such order as there is in the world and doing so in the
American interest. It means laying down the rules America
wants]{.underline} (on everything from markets to weapons of mass
destruction) **[while exempting itself from other rules]{.underline}**
(the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and the International Criminal
Court) that go against its interest."30 At the height of the war on
terror, jurists advising the George W. Bush administration used a
similar logic to justify the suspension of the rule of law and Geneva
conventions.31 [One can defend these inconsistencies as necessary, or
not. That they continually recur suggests that liberal "world ordering"
is an inescapably compromised process.]{.underline}

[The United States is an imperial power, even if it is distinct from
former empires. It may lack the land hunger of empires past and look
different from European or Asian imperialisms. It was averse to formal
annexation, refused to claim the mantle of empire, and made a succession
of retreats, from Vietnam, Lebanon, and Iraq.]{.underline} But [it still
throws its weight around in imperial ways: through coercion, subversion,
or patronage, it penetrates the sovereign autonomy of other states to
constrain their choices]{.underline}. [The political economy underlying
American interventions was at times coercive]{.underline}, as in the
structural-adjustment programs visited on developing countries from
Eastern Europe to Latin America. Leading [primacists who speak up for
liberal world ordering have earlier acknowledged that the American
project overseas must be necessarily imperial, albeit in this case of a
distinctively informal "American" kind, involving the forceful
suppression of revolt, hard-nosed enforcement of parameters around other
states' policies, and the exercise of unequal bargaining
influence.]{.underline}32 But for the most part, **[today's lamentations
for a dying liberal order do not acknowledge the necessarily imperial
component.]{.underline}** This is the imperialism that does not know
itself.

### Turn -- Hegemonic Coercion

#### Turn - Soft power is a euphemism for hegemonic coercion- it naturalizes US violence 

**Bilgin, professor of international relations at Bilkent, 2008**

(Pinar, "Hard Power, Soft Power: Toward a More Realistic Power
Analysis", <http://www.bilkent.edu.tr/~pbilgin/Bilgin-Elis-IT-2008.pdf>
MK)

On another level, [Nye's (soft) power]{.underline} analysis [is
problematic insofar as his own agenda of 'success]{.underline} in world
politics' is concerned. [This is not only because his analysis fosters
the false impression that 'soft power' is a nice and cuddly surrogate to
'hard power', but]{.underline} also [because]{.underline} he
[underestimates the extent to which U.S. soft power is produced and
expressed through compulsion.]{.underline} After all, [compulsory power
is not limited to the use of material resources]{.underline}.
Non-material forms of power, such as '[symbolic power', may]{.underline}
also [be used for the purpose of coercing another]{.underline}.
Barnett's analysis of Arab politics is highly illuminating in this
regard; during the Arab Cold War 'symbolic power' was used by 'radical'
Arab states to bring into line their 'conservative' counterparts by
touting the attractiveness of 'Arab nationalism' for Arab peoples across
the Middle East.51 By failing to inquire into how the production and
expression of soft power can also cause harm, Nye does disservice to
both his power analysis and his agenda for U.S. 'success' in world
politics. To recapitulate, in Part I we pointed to the poverty of
realist power analysis for taking agents as well as the stockpile of
power as pre-given and focusing on decision-making in cases of visible
conflict. Following Lukes, we called for adopting Bachrach and Baratz's
conception of two-dimensional power, which would allow looking at
instances of decision-making and nondecision-making. Nye's conception of
soft power constitutes an improvement upon realist power analysis
insofar as it raises the analyst's awareness of the 'second face of
power'. For, the [very notion of 'attraction' suggests that there is a
conflict of interest that does not come to the surface.]{.underline}
That is to say, B does not express its grievances and does what A wants
it to do, because it is attracted to A's culture, political values
and/or foreign policy. That said, Nye's analysis rests on a conception
of power that is somehow less than three-dimensional. While Nye
encourages the analyst to be curious about those instances of power
expression where there is no visible conflict and/or clash of interests,
his failure to register how soft power is 'not-so-soft' means that his
(soft) power analysis does not fully capture the 'third face of power'.
Let us clarify. Lukes understands the 'third face of power' as those
instances when "A may exercise power over B by getting him to do what he
does not want to do, but he also exercises power over him by
influencing, shaping, or determining his very wants".52 [Post-colonial
peoples' post-WWII rush towards sovereign statehood may be viewed as an
example of the 'third face of power' whereby the international society
shaped their wants while their actual circumstances called for other
forms of political community]{.underline}. That is to say, in Lukes'
framework, B does what A wants in apparent readiness contrary to its own
interests. Put differently, [by exercising soft power, A prevents B from
recognizing its own 'real interests'.]{.underline} While Nye's attention
to A's ability to shape B's wants seem to render his analysis
three-dimensional, his lack of curiosity into 'not-so-soft' expressions
of U.S. power renders his (soft) power analysis two-and-a-half
dimensional. This is mostly because Nye assumes that B's 'real
interests' are also served when it follows A's lead. It is true that
soft power does not involve physical coercion, but as Lukes reminded us,
[it is the supreme and most insidious exercise of power to prevent
people, to whatever degree, from having grievances by shaping their
perceptions, cognitions and preferences in such a way that they accept
their role in the existing order of things]{.underline}, either because
they can see or imagine no alternative to it, or [because they see it as
natural and unchangeable,]{.underline} or because they value it as
divinely ordained and beneficial.53 Going back to the example of
North/South relations, [power is involved not only when the South does
not express its grievance]{.underline} because of the absence of
opportunities to do so, [but also when it seemingly has no grievances as
a consequence of the prevalent system of ideas that depoliticizes its
status within the international economic order]{.underline}.54 In a
similar fashion, Nye is not interested in inquiring into the sources of
U.S. 'attraction', for he considers the U.S.'s ability to shape the
wants of others as befitting the latter's 'real interests'. Accordingly,
he misses a 'fundamental part of soft power', what Bohas describes as
"the early shaping of taste, collective imaginary and ideals which
constitutes a way of dominating other countries. This includes the
reinforcing effect of the social process in favor of American power
through goods and values".55 As such, Nye's analysis remains limited in
regard to the third face of soft power, where the existing state of
things is internalized by the actors, and the U.S.'s expression of power
seems benign and in accordance with the 'real interests' of others. In
sum, the limits of [Nye's approach]{.underline}, which could be
characterized as 'two-and-a-half dimensional power analysis', does not
allow him to offer a theory of power that reflects upon its own
moment(s) and site(s) of production and 'not-so-soft' expression. This
is not to underestimate what Nye's (soft) power analysis delivers.
Rather, our aim has been to push his analysis further towards generating
a more realistic framework where one's scope of research is not limited
to the acts or inacts of actors but investigates how different actors'
needs and wants as well as their understanding of themselves and their
'real interests' are shaped by other actors or by the existing
structures.

[The gap between America's values and actions]{.underline} revealed by
this polling data [has severely eroded U.S. global
influence]{.underline}. [How can you and your administration gain it
back?]{.underline}

[First, you should make it clear that one of our country's bedrock
principles is the international rule of law]{.underline}. [Human rights
are de-fined and protected by the Constitution and international
treaties ratified and incorporated into our domestic law]{.underline}.
[In flaunting basic rules---such as habeas corpus, the Convention
against Torture, and the Geneva Conventions---the previous
administration created a series of "law-free zones." Within these zones,
detainees were abused, thousands were held indefinitely without charges,
and human rights were trampled.]{.underline}

[Second, you should bring U.S. values and practices back into alignment.
The United States in recent years has lost credibility by charging
others with the types of human rights violations that it has committed
itself. In recent annual country reports on human rights practices, the
State Department has criticized other countries for engaging in torture,
detention without trial, warrantless electronic surveillance, and other
abuses, even though the U.S. record in these areas also has been
abysmal.]{.underline}

#### Stopping sales to Saudi Arabia won't end violence -- increased military support to Houthi's means that conflict continues.

)

**[Contrary to the critics' assumptions, stopping support to the
Saudi-led coalition in Yemen will not end the violence, nor will it
alleviate the humanitarian crisis.]{.underline}** It [is a call to leave
the internationally recognized government of Yemen and Yemen's 28
million people at the mercy of several ruthless, **militant nonstate
actors**. That includes the Iranian-supported Houthi militia that began
this conflict and whose intransigence is preventing it from being
resolved.]{.underline} [In addition, there are two other even more
brutal terrorist groups---**al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and
the so-called Islamic State---that would relish the opportunity to
operate in a security and political vacuum.** It is also a call to
abandon Saudi Arabia, a reliable partner that has fought side by side
with the United States against communist expansionism, **Saddam
Hussein's invading forces in Kuwait in 1990, and, more recently, ISIS in
Syria.** Just as important, it would be tantamount to carte blanche for
Iran, which appears intent on creating yet another proxy force that
would do its bidding, much as it has done with the militant group
Hezbollah in Lebanon.4 As the conflict continues, evidence has been
uncovered by the Yemeni government, the Saudi-led coalition, and the US
government that strongly suggests that **Iran's military and
technological support to the Houthis has increased considerably over the
course of the conflict.5 That has enabled the Houthis to continue
fighting and to continue to threaten the security of Saudi Arabia by
employing ever more sophisticated military tactics, including the use of
increasingly longer-range ballistic missiles as well as unmanned drones
and speedboats.6** Calls to cut and run from Yemen are a recipe for
increased instability and violence, not the opposite. The fact that
**these advocates rarely provide concrete recommendations as to how to
bring the conflict to an end, alleviate the humanitarian situation, and
assist Yemen on the road to recovery is also telling**]{.underline}

[The first year of Trump's presidency was marked by a frenzy of activity
on domestic issues]{.underline}. His administration instituted **[harsh
new immigration rules]{.underline}** that are [ripping apart families
and communities]{.underline}. Between late January and early September
2017[, the total number of immigrants arrested inside the
country]{.underline} (versus at the border) [increased by 43
percent]{.underline} compared with the number arrested during the
equivalent time period under President Barack Obama in 2016. These are
people who have been uprooted from communities where they have families
and deep ties. **[The president has also issued a series of travel
bans]{.underline}**, all of [which use classic scapegoating tactics and
bigotry to incite fears about Muslims and refugee-resettlement
programs]{.underline}. Although the courts blocked the original and most
draconian versions of this ban, in late 2017, they did allow a revised
version to proceed.

**[The president has empowered bigots]{.underline}** [by making racially
charged statements, including referring to white supremacists marching
in Charlottesville, Virginia, as "very fine people."]{.underline} He
[has sought to end what he calls the "very dangerous anti-police
atmosphere in America]{.underline}," which is a direct rebuke to
activists calling for racial justice in policing. He has also gravely
[harmed women's rights by attacking reproductive choice, halting an
equal-pay measure, and weakening protections against gender-based
violence on college campuses.]{.underline}

[On foreign policy,]{.underline} meanwhile**[, the administration has
dismissed or damaged the global human rights framework]{.underline}**.
Under Trump, the [United States has walked away from (or threatened to
walk away from) a number of vital global commitments, institutions, and
initiatives that would provide an opportunity to share the burden of
combating global challenges while respecting rights]{.underline}. The
administration has **[threatened to withdraw from the UN Human Rights
Council]{.underline}**, largely because the Palestinian territories (and
therefore Israel) are a permanent item on its agenda. It's true that the
council has flaws, but it has also successfully documented and exposed
many human rights issues of concern to U.S. law and policymakers.
**[Walking away would not only weaken the council but also limit the
available avenues for Washington to promote human rights]{.underline}**.
[From the UN's negotiations on the compact for global migration to the
Paris agreement on climate change]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} Trump
[administration has repeatedly suggested multilateral institutions are
of no use to the United States,]{.underline} [even though the country
was instrumental in creating the UN, as well as many of the norms and
laws that guide thinking about human rights today.]{.underline}

[When it comes to human rights, symbolism matters]{.underline}, and
[under this administration, human rights activists have been made to
feel as though they aren't important.]{.underline} **[The president and
his top national security officials have metwith very few frontline
activists and have held very few meetings with civil society before or
during overseas trips]{.underline}**---a practice that previous
presidents often used so as to hear directly from ordinary citizens
about the challenges they were facing.

[Words matter, too,]{.underline} and **[Trump's fulsome praise of
strongmen,]{.underline}** [many of whom he has hosted at the White House
with great fanfare and little condemnation, has been taken by many as
permission for brutality]{.underline}. Last April, [he congratulated
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a military dictator who has
overseen a vicious crackdown on government critics, for doing "a
fantastic job]{.underline}." [The next month, counter to a promise made
to the White House, Sisi signed a draconian law regulating civil
society]{.underline}. Perhaps [he was emboldened by Trump's comment in
Saudi Arabia a week earlier:]{.underline} "**[We are not here to
lecture---we are not here to tell other people how to
live."]{.underline}** On that same visit to Saudi Arabia, [Trump told
Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, the king of Bahrain, "There won't be strain
with this administration]{.underline}," **[which the Bahraini regime
evidently viewed as a green light to intensify
repression]{.underline}**. As Nabeel Rajab, an imprisoned Bahraini
activist (and member of Human Rights Watch's Middle East advisory
committee), has written, "[It was no coincidence that days later,
Bahraini police used the deadliest force we have seen in decades,
killing five protesters."]{.underline}

Similarly, [politicians looking to discredit the free press have latched
on to the term "fake news," one of Trump's favorite
phrases]{.underline}. In Syria, [President Bashar al-Assad rejected an
Amnesty International report documenting the brutal killing of 13,000
military prisoners]{.underline}, saying, "[You can forge anything these
days. We are living in a fake-news era."]{.underline} [In Myanmar, where
security forces have undertaken a campaign of ethnic cleansing against
Rohingya Muslims, a government official went so far as to
say,]{.underline} "[There is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake
news]{.underline}." **[The term has become a catch phrase for government
officials in China, the Philippines, Russia, and
Venezuela]{.underline}** [who wish to shield themselves from scrutiny
and create a climate of fear that vilifies dissenting
voices.]{.underline} Indeed, according to the Committee to Protect
Journalists, which has been keeping a database of imprisoned journalists
since the early 1990s, [the number of people charged with reporting
"false news" rose to a record high in 2017.]{.underline}

#### Alt cause -- global gag rule

Perhaps it should not be surprising that a man who was caught on tape
bragging about sexual assault has put in place policies that set back
the rights of women and girls around the world. But [the swiftness of
the rollback has been startling. In keeping with Republican tradition,
the Trump administration has cut off U.S. funding for the UN Population
Fund, which provides lifesaving maternal care for women, falsely
claiming that it promotes forced abortions]{.underline}. [And the
reversal of so many domestic policies in support of gender equality no
doubt undermines U.S. credibility overseas when it comes to empowering
women and girls.]{.underline}

But perhaps [**the greatest threat to women will come from Trump's
expansion of the so-called Mexico City policy**, also known as **"the
global gag rule**," a long-standing policy of Republican administrations
that imposes conditions on health-care organizations receiving U.S.
aid]{.underline}. To keep their U.S. funding, [these organizations must
certify that they are not using their other funds to provide abortions
(]{.underline}except in cases of rape, incest, or to save a woman's
life) [and that they are not offering information about or referrals for
abortions or advocating them. Otherwise, they lose all their U.S.
funding.]{.underline} In one of his first acts as president, [Trump
dramatically expanded the scope of funds affected by this restriction,
raising the amount of aid at stake from \$600 million to \$9
billion.]{.underline}

[The United States is by far the world's largest health donor, so the
rule will inflict untold harm on women, girls, and their
families]{.underline}. It will likely [hinder hard-fought progress on
health care in poor and middle-income countries, particularly those that
rely heavily on U.S. resources. Affected health programs may have to cut
not only their family-planning offerings but also services linked to
child health, including vaccinations and the prevention and treatment of
HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.]{.underline}

As research by Human Rights Watch in Africa has found, [the new rule
already means fewer health services of all types, not just the loss of
safe abortion care.]{.underline} To take one example, [Family Health
Options Kenya, an organization set to lose U.S. funds, has curtailed
outreach services such as family planning, cervical cancer testing, and
HIV testing for impoverished communities, and it has already closed one
clinic]{.underline}. Organizations in Kenya that have no choice but to
agree to the new restrictions because they depend on these funds worry
that more women will die from unsafe abortions, a leading cause of
maternal mortality in the country. In Uganda, the policy presents a
difficult choice for organizations with multiple public health
campaigns: Should they keep the funds and focus just on fighting
HIV/AIDS, or should they reject the funds and work to end injuries and
deaths from back-alley abortions?

Trump's policy is not only an assault on women's health; it is also
likely to be self-defeating. A 2011 Stanford University study found that
when a more limited version of the Mexico City policy was last in place,
during the George W. Bush administration, sub-Saharan Africa actually
saw abortions increase. This happened particularly in parts of the
continent that had few health-care options and relied heavily on U.S.
funds. Although the researchers could not conclusively explain this
uptick, their leading interpretation was that an overall decline in
family-planning resources led to more unplanned pregnancies and more
abortions. [It stands to reason that an expanded version of the policy
will lead to even more preventable maternal deaths, due to an increase
in both unplanned pregnancies and unsafe abortions---to say nothing of
its effect on efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and child
malnutrition.]{.underline}

[Because the United States is the world's preeminent military power, its
use of force is watched closely]{.underline}, [especially when the White
House has unequivocally pushed for a greater reliance on hard
power]{.underline}. Indeed, [the Trump administration has increased
defense spending while reducing foreign aid]{.underline}. It [has
reversed a policy to phase out the use of cluster bombs, a particularly
indiscriminate explosive]{.underline}. It has [signed secret changes
that undo the Obama administration's more restrictive policies regarding
the use of drone strikes and commando raids, a shift that will
inevitably lead to less transparency and accountability and more
civilian deaths]{.underline}. It has also [accelerated arms sales,
including to governments with poor track records on human rights, and
has signaled its intention to loosen restrictions on arms
exports]{.underline}---a shortsighted move that would prioritize
economic interests over values.

In the fight against the Islamic State, or ISIS, [the Trump
administration has demonstrated a noted antipathy toward the laws of
war]{.underline}. As a candidate[, Trump promised to "bomb the shit out
of" ISIS]{.underline}, and as president, [he has lessened the White
House's oversight of air strikes in Iraq and Syria while giving
commanders in the field more control, even as they shifted to more
intense urban warfare]{.underline}.

In recent years, [the Department of Defense has sought to make the
details of its campaign against ISIS somewhat more
transparent]{.underline}. The Pentagon regularly publishes information
on its website about war costs, and even posts videos of air strikes. It
also publishes a monthly report examining civilian casualties. [But over
the last year, human rights groups, the UN, and journalists have found
growing evidence that a dramatically higher number of civilians are
being killed by U.S. forces or U.S.-led coalition forces in Iraq and
Syria]{.underline} (as well as Afghanistan) [than]{.underline} [what is
officially reported. In some cases, these investigations have found
serious violations of the laws of armed conflict]{.underline}. An
exhaustive inquiry by The New York Times Magazine concluded that [the
campaign against ISIS may be the least transparent war in recent U.S.
history]{.underline}. The magazine reported that [one civilian is killed
for every five coalition air strikes---more than 31 times the rate the
coalition has acknowledged.]{.underline}

Parts of this strategic shift began during the Obama administration. In
December 2016, [the Pentagon removed the requirement for a "strike cell"
in Baghdad, which had served as a collection point for information about
planned targets for air strikes in Iraq---an extra check to avoid
civilian casualties]{.underline}. [But the Trump administration
exacerbated the problem by speeding up the tempo of operations without
doing enough to mitigate civilian harm. The Pentagon also failed to
consistently ensure that there had been adequate checks on intelligence
collection before approving an air strike, and it has used munitions and
firepower generally not considered appropriate for urban
warfare]{.underline}. [Investigations to assess allegations of civilian
harm in the aftermath of a lethal strike have become deeply inadequate,
hampered in part by the lack of a clear process for gathering
information from those closest to the ground, such as local activists,
emergency responders, and nongovernmental organization]{.underline}s.

H[uman rights concerns have always competed with national security
considerations]{.underline}. [For too long, Washington has adopted
policies in the name of protecting national security that come at the
expense of human rights, forgetting the long-term costs of doing
so]{.underline}. The Obama administration's arms sales to Saudi Arabia,
despite the Saudi-led coalition's unlawful air strikes against civilians
in Yemen, is a prime example of the harm this approach can do, with
thousands of civilians killed and anti-American sentiment on the rise in
the country. [Another is the CIA's secret post-9/11 torture and
rendition program, which the Bush administration launched in violation
of international obligations and U.S. law and which has undermined
Washington's credibility on human rights.]{.underline} But [even as the
United States struggled with how and when to promote human rights, there
was always a common understanding that doing so was a key part of what
defined the United States---and what Americans believed was the right
thing for their government to do.]{.underline}

**[Not so under Trump]{.underline}**. [Although some lower-level U.S.
officials appear committed to keeping human rights a priority, others
have concluded that this may be impossible]{.underline}. In November,
for example, Elizabeth Shackelford, a U.S. Foreign Service officer who
most recently served in Kenya, resigned from the State Department in
protest, writing, "[Our government has failed to demonstrate a
commitment to promoting and defending human rights and democracy." **No
one who is actually running U.S. foreign policy seems to believe that
the advancement of fundamental rights should be one of its central
pillars.**]{.underline}

[Given the United States' historically spotty record on promoting human
rights, there are those who think that other governments can pick up the
slack.]{.underline} [But in reality, the loss of the United States as a
champion,]{.underline} however inconsistent its support can be, [is
likely to further encourage governments to treat their citizens
poorly]{.underline}, [confident that no meaningful rebuke will
follow]{.underline}. [It is also likely to create a leadership vacuum,
and the countries that aim to fill it---such as China, Iran, Russia, and
Venezuela---will no doubt seek to spread their no-strings-attached
approach to global affairs.]{.underline}

So what is to be done? Realistically, [the next few years are likely to
be hard on human rights]{.underline}. But despite the absence of U.S.
leadership, [there]{.underline} [have been some bright
spots,]{.underline} with rights-minded countries stepping up. At the UN
Human Rights Council, for example, [the Netherlands managed to overcome
opposition from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the United
States to launch an independent investigation into the Saudi-led
campaign in Yemen.]{.underline} Similarly, Iceland took the lead in
drafting and collecting support from 38 other countries for a joint
statement at the council condemning Duterte's bloody "war on drugs." As
long as Trump is in power, such ad hoc coalitions of like-minded
countries will need to become the norm.

There is also much that other parts of the U.S. government can do to
protect human rights. Just as some cities and states have decided to
comply with the Paris climate agreement despite the federal government's
withdrawal, they can also find ways to protect immigrants caught up in
the Trump administration's dragnet and keep families and communities
intact.

Congress, for its part, has already resisted a number of presidential
initiatives in the interest of human rights. In May, a bipartisan group
of 15 senators sent Trump a letter urging him to "ensure that America
remains a leader in advocating for democracy and human rights."
Congressional committees are using aid allocations and authorization
bills to push back against the executive branch. Individual members of
Congress are drafting legislation, holding hearings, and meeting with
foreign officials to stand up for human rights in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Russia, and elsewhere. In December, the
Treasury Department, under pressure from Congress, imposed sanctions on
13 individuals---from Belgium, China, the Dominican Republic, Gambia,
Guatemala, Israel, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Russia, Serbia, Sudan,
and Uzbekistan---for corruption and human rights abuses.

**[But]{.underline}** **[these efforts can only go so
far.]{.underline}** [Petition gathering by like-minded countries is less
effective without the most powerful country on earth.]{.underline} State
and local governments can only do so much to work around the federal
government. [And although **Congress** controls the power of the purse,
it **has far less influence on foreign policy than the executive
branch**]{.underline}. And **[all the while, the White House's attacks
on immigrants, health care, minority communities, and the justice system
will continue to diminish American credibility on human rights
overseas]{.underline}**. Simply put, [unless it changes course
dramatically, the Trump administration---and the president
himself---will remain one of the greatest threats to human rights in
decades]{.underline}.

## Framing

### AT: Moral Obligation

### Framing

#### Prefer a human rights decision calculus grounded in probability and moral duty 

**Reeves, Binghamton University Department of Philosophy Professor,
2015**

\[Anthony R., July 2015, Social Theory and Practice, "Standard Threats:
How to Violate Basic Human Rights." Vol. 41, No. 3 pages 412-413, GDI
LNM\]

[A success condition for a theory of human rights is that it should show
them to be practically meaningful for national and international
policy]{.underline}. In particular[, rights should provide guidance to
practical reason about what is permissible by grounding
duties]{.underline}. Understanding rights as requiring outcomes (e.g.,
preventing harm) undermines their ability to provide such guidance. Even
in a deterministic universe[,]{.underline} our epistemic relationship to
the causally complex world rarely affords justified certainty in a
particular outcome---and this, again, is exacerbated at the level of
social policy. From the ex ante perspective of the agent, the
relationship between a decision and outcomes is probabilistic, and
almost always involves probabilities other than zero and one. [Rights
theory has four options. One, it could forbid any action that has a
probability greater than zero of harming a protected
interest]{.underline}. As noted above, [this would paralyze the agent.
Two, it could permit any action that is not guaranteed to result in
harm. This would render almost all activity, including extremely risky
activity, permissible]{.underline} from the standpoint of rights. [One
would be barely capable of violating rights. Three, the morality of
rights could prescind from saying anything about risk impositions---it
could simply be a morality of outcomes. In this case, it offers little
advice to the decisionmaker, as she normally decides on the basis of
probabilities. Four, it offers a principled account of acceptable
risking to protected interests,]{.underline} where acceptability can
fall between zero and one. Options one through three effectively have
the result that either (nearly) all actions are permissible or (nearly)
all actions are impermissible in terms of rights from the ex ante
perspective of decision. Guidance could still be sought elsewhere in
morality, but in order to know whether any action or policy purportedly
concerning human rights is permissible, we would have to rely almost
exclusively upon heterogeneous moral concerns. Hence, we should not
understand human rights' duties in outcome-centric terms.

Call the following the practical inference test[. Any nonskeptical
account of human rights must show them to regularly assist inferences
about what it is prospectively permissible to do.]{.underline}
Interpreting human rights requirements in terms of determinate outcomes
fails this test. Perhaps, though, it might be thought that I am moving
too quickly, by ignoring the difference between knowing how to fulfill
our duties and what, as a moral question, our duties are. I have a duty
not to kill innocents, but it is up to me (given my knowledge of human
anatomy, basic facts about the world, and so on) to discern how to act
pursuant to this requirement (by, for example, not firing a weapon into
a crowd). A similar point might hold for human rights. Although an
important distinction, it does not help the position rejected here.
[From the standpoint of decision, when we are discerning permissibility,
requirements demanding certain outcomes cannot settle the permissible
"how." Again, any policy an agent adopts to avoid/achieve an outcome
will have a probabilistic relationship to the outcome.]{.underline} We
want to know whether the policy crosses the threshold of acceptable
probability. Sometimes this will be intuitively clear, as in the crowd
case. Sometimes it will be less clear, as when one hunts game in lightly
populated areas. The agent needs to know in advance which is acceptable,
even when the former could result in no injury, and the latter in a
human fatality[. What the agent needs, to select a policy, is a
principled way of adjudicating probabilities. Merely mandating an
outcome does not do this, thus failing the practical inference
test]{.underline}.

Return now to the torturer and the traffic accident. Almost all human
rights theorists agree that we want to at least be able to hold
political institutions accountable in terms of human rights. The
examples illustrate the difficulty of relying on mere deprivation,
treatment, or harm for identifying when institutions violate human
rights. If a polity has a policy of torturing suspects, this is clear
enough. Yet, the event of torture, in the presence of effective, active,
and well-regulated legal institutions protecting personal security, does
not implicate a violation on the part of the polity. More generally, not
all setbacks to interests deserving protection register as human rights
violations. Again, the fatal traffic accident (which was avoidable---the
polity could forbid motor vehicles) involves basic setbacks to human
interests: death. Yet, we do not regard the harm as a rights violation
on the part of political institutions. No one has been wronged, and no
reparative response appears in order---a mundane example, but it
requires explanation, and others could be adduced: thefts, accidents,
acts of God, and so on. The explanation, I suggest, is that we only
treat unintentional harm as involving human rights violation when the
injury is a function of an inadequate response to risk[. When an agent
ought to have foreseen and mitigated dangers to protected interests, but
failed (in either respect) and harm is a consequence of this failure, we
can then treat the injury as implicating a human rights
violation.]{.underline} Call the demand that a theory of human rights
should only hold institutions accountable for wrongful injury (rather
than injury generally), and should have some principled basis for
distinguishing between wrongful and nonwrongful injuries, the
institutional negligence test.

- announce that the US is bound by the human rights treaties and
  conventions it has ratified

- close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay

- create a high-level commission to compile the record of human rights
  abuses in the war on terror

- establish a United States Commission on Human Rights with oversight
  authority and subpoena power

- provide assistance to other countries for counter terrorism operations
  that includes training to foreign militaries that complies with human
  rights standards

- help countries build their own democratic societies based on an
  understanding of cultural and religious differences

- and invoke the Doctrine of Responsibility to Protect to work with

Fortunately, [history shows that U.S. credibility on human rights can be
restored when our government's policies reflect our na-tion's values. A
series of bipartisan initiatives during five recent
presidencies----three Republican and two Democratic----illustrates the
point.]{.underline}

[President Gerald Ford signed the Helsinki Accords, paving the way for
international recognition of the cause of human rights inside the Soviet
bloc. President Jimmy Carter mobilized democratic governments to press
for the release of political prisoners by repressive regimes. President
Ronald Reagan signed the Con-vention against Torture and persuaded a
Republican-dominated Senate to ratify it. President George H. W. Bush
joined with other governments in the Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe to nurture new democracies and respect for human
rights following the end of the Cold War. And President Bill Clinton
worked with NATO and the UN to implement the Genocide Conven-tion and
bring an end to the human rights catastrophe in the
Balkans.]{.underline}

Mr. President, [you can restore U.S. influence by reconnecting the
nation's values and policies on human rights and the rule of law. Among
the initiatives that you might take are the following.]{.underline}

[Human Rights Law Enforcement]{.underline}. [You should announce that
the United States is bound by the human rights treaties and con-ventions
that it has ratified and adopted as domestic law, including the Geneva
Conventions, the Torture Convention, and the Interna-tional Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights]{.underline}. [You should follow through with
your commitment to close the detention center at Guan-tanamo and
transfer detainees to this country for determinations whether to try
them in U.S. courts or release them.]{.underline} Fully complying with
the Geneva Conventions would not preclude the United States from trying
detainees in military commissions under constitutional standards of due

lawful interrogations to obtain intelligence in-formation about
terrorist activities.

[Truth Commission]{.underline}. [At times in our recent history, the
nation has created high-level commissions to probe national crises and
recommend ways to prevent them in the future. In the area of human
rights, these bodies have included]{.underline}, most notably, [the
Kerner Commission on race in the 1960s and the commission in the 1980s
on the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The recent
commission on the events of 9/11 had a comparable scope and impact in
addressing a complex and far-reaching national crisis. A similar
commission could be established to compile the record of human rights
abuses in the War on Terror.]{.underline}

[U.S. Commission on Human Rights]{.underline}. [A permanent institution
could be created to monitor the U.S. government's compliance with its
legal obligations on human rights.]{.underline} [I urge you to endorse
legislation pending in Congress that would establish a United States
Commission on Human Rights with oversight authority and subpoena power.
The legislation would require the executive branch to provide regular
reports to the commission on its implementation of international human
rights treaties such as the Torture Convention and the Geneva
Conventions.]{.underline}

[Counterterrorism Assistance]{.underline}. [The United States could
provide assistance to other countries for counterterrorism operations
that comply with basic standards on human rights]{.underline}.
"[Fighting terror" has become a convenient excuse for repressive regimes
around the world to engage in further repression, often leading to more
terrorism in an increasing cycle of violence. To break this cycle, this
country could provide assistance and training to foreign military and
law enforcement personnel in methods of fighting terrorism within the
rule of law.]{.underline}

[Democracy and Human Rights Assistance]{.underline}. [The United States
should find appropriate ways to support those seeking to promote the
rule of law, democracy, and human rights within their own
countries]{.underline}. [Democracy and human rights activists are the
shock troops in the struggle against terrorism. But democracy and human
rights can never be delivered from the barrel of a gun. Assistance to
those working to build their own democratic societies must be carefully
planned, sustained over time, and based on a thorough understand-ing of
the unique circumstances and profound differences among cultures,
religions, and countries. The new administration should work within a
multilateral framework to assist those struggling around the world to
bring democracy and human rights to their own societies.]{.underline}

[Responsibility to Protect.]{.underline} [The United States should join
with other countries, alliances, and international organizations to
pre-vent or stop crimes against humanity and genocide]{.underline}. Mr.
President, you could [invoke the Doctrine of Responsibility to Protect,
adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2006, to work with other leaders
to develop effective multilateral methods of preventing human rights
catastrophes]{.underline} such as Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Darfur[.
Diplomatic and economic tools should be employed first to head off
im-pending genocides, but multilateral military intervention must remain
available under international law if other means have been
ex-hausted.]{.underline}

[By recommitting the United States to a foreign policy conducted within
a framework of human rights and the rule of law]{.underline}, Presi-dent

doing so, strengthen U.S. national security.]{.underline}

### Solvency - Arms are Leverage

#### US arms deal to Saudi Arabia is the most important leverage right now

Eighteen months ago, Donald Trump visited Saudi Arabia and said he had
concluded \$110 billion dollars in arms sales with the kingdom. It was
fake news then and it's still fake news today. The [Saudis have
not]{.underline} [concluded a single major arms deal]{.underline} [with
Washington on Trump's watch]{.underline}. [Nonetheless]{.underline}, the
[U.S. arms relationship]{.underline} [with the kingdom is the most
important leverage Washington has]{.underline} as it contemplates
reacting to the alleged murder of Jamal Khashoggi. In June 2017, after
the president's visit to Riyadh---his first official foreign travel---we
published a Brookings blog post detailing that his claims to have sold
\$110 billion in weapons were spurious. Other media outlets subsequently
came to the same conclusion. [When Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin
Salman visited the White House]{.underline} this year, [the president
indirectly confirmed that non-deal by chiding the prince for spending
only "peanuts" on arms from America.]{.underline} Follow the Money. The
[Saudis have continued to buy spare parts, munitions, and technical
support for the enormous amount of American equipment they have bought
from previous administrations.]{.underline} The [Royal Saudi Air
Force]{.underline} (RSAF[) is entirely dependent on American and British
support for its]{.underline} air fleet of [F15 fighter
jets,]{.underline} Apache [helicopters, and Tornado
aircraf]{.underline}t. [If]{.underline} either [Washington]{.underline}
or London [halts the flow of logistics, the RSAF will be
grounded.]{.underline} The Saudi army and the Saudi Arabian National
Guard are similarly dependent on foreigners (the Saudi Arabian National
Guard is heavily dependent on Canada). The same is also true for the
Saudis allies like Bahrain. [Under]{.underline} President [Obama, Saudi
Arabia spent]{.underline} well [over \$110 billion in U.S.
weapons]{.underline}, including for aircraft, helicopters, and air
defense missiles. [These deals were the largest in American
history.]{.underline} Saudi commentators routinely decried Obama for
failing to protect Saudi interests, but the kingdom loved his arms
deals. [But the kingdom [has not
bought](http://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-hasnt-signed-us-arms-deals-talking-to-russia-about-s-400-2018-10) any
new arms platform during the Trump administration.]{.underline} Only one
has even been seriously discussed: [A \$15 billion deal for THAAD,
terminal high altitude area defense missiles, has gotten the most
attention and preliminary approval from Congress, but the Saudis let
pass a]{.underline} September [deadline for the deal with Lockheed
Martin]{.underline}. The Saudis certainly need more air defenses with
the pro-Iran Zaydi Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen firing ballistic
missiles at Saudi cities. [The three and a half year-old Saudi war in
Yemen is hugely expensive.]{.underline} There are no public figures from
the Saudi government about the war's costs, but a conservative estimate
would be at least \$50 billion per year. [Maintenance costs for aircraft
and warships go up dramatically when they are constantly in combat
operations.]{.underline} The Royal Saudi Navy has been blockading Yemen
for over 40 months. [The RSAF has conducted thousands of air
strikes.]{.underline} T[he war is draining the kingdom's coffers. And
responsibility]{.underline} for the war [is on Mohammed bin
Salman,]{.underline} who as defense minister has driven Riyadh into this
quagmire. [Shaking the arms relationship is by far the most important
way to clip his wings.]{.underline}

### Human Rights Discourse Bad

#### Human rights discourse in policy making is a guise to hide the national interests of the government

**Shestack, Philadelphia lawyer and human rights advocate, '97**

\[Jerome J., served as president of the American Bar Association from
1997-998, Fordham International Law Journal , "Globalization of Human
Rights Law," Volume: 21, Number 2, page 10-11, GDI LNM\]

[It should be obvious that if international human rights are to prevail
on a global scale, it is critical for individual nations to include
international rights in the calculus of their foreign
policy]{.underline}. As late as the mid 1970s, a focus on international
human rights essentially did not figure in the foreign policy of, even
democratic Western nations. Of course, [the idealistic ends of human
rights - peace, freedom, order, justice - have always been staples of
political rhetoric. But the engine that drives the foreign policy of
most nations is \"interests.\" And international human rights was
regarded almost uniformly, as a moral impulse, rather than a matter of
national interest.]{.underline}

[On the face of it, it appears reasonable for any nation to concentrate
on its own national interest. Realistically, however, at any particular
time, national interest is no more than an afterthe-fact label to
rationalize policies determined by the governing
administration]{.underline}. Hence, [human rights will occupy a central
role in a nation\'s foreign policy only when its leaders are persuaded
that a focus on human rights goals advances the nation\'s interest and
is worth pursuing in the face of competing, and]{.underline} sometimes
[clashing, interests.]{.underline}

[One reason for a nation to include human rights observance in foreign
policy is that the human rights movement]{.underline} had [caught
fire]{.underline}, [appealing to the aspirations of people on every
continent]{.underline}. [Championing the human rights
cause]{.underline}, thus, [afforded a unique opportunity for democratic
nations to be responsive to those aspirations]{.underline}. Moreover,
[championing human rights gave democratic nations a lead in the contest
with the Communist world for the \"hearts and minds of
men]{.underline}.\" Thus, [championing human rights was a particularly
appealing role for the United States and Western European
nations]{.underline}.

### Human Rights Imperialism

#### The aff's justification of human rights is a thinly veiled imperialism -- turns the case 

**Kinzer, Watson Institute International and Public Affairs Senior
Fellow, 10**

\[Stephen, former New York Times award-winning foreign correspondent who
has covered more than 50 countries on five continents, The Guardian,
12/31/10,
[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/31/human-rights-imperialism-james-hoge

EO\]

For those of us who used to consider ourselves part of the human rights
movement but have lost the faith, the most intriguing piece of news in
2010 was the appointment of an eminent foreign policy mandarin, James
Hoge, as board chairman of Human Rights Watch.

Hoge has a huge task, and not simply because [human rights violations
around the world are s]{.underline}o [pervasive and
egregious]{.underline}. Just as great [a challenge is remaking the human
rights movement itself. Founded by idealists who wanted to make the
world a better place**, it has in recent years become the vanguard of a
new form of imperialism**.]{.underline}

[Want to depose the government of a poor country with resources? Want to
bash Muslims? Want to build support for American military interventions
around the world? Want to undermine governments that are raising their
people up from poverty because they don\'t conform to the tastes of
upper west side intellectuals? Use human rights as your
excuse]{.underline}!

This has become the unspoken mantra of a movement that has lost its way.

[Human Rights Watch is hardly the only offender. There are a host of
others, ranging from Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders
to the Carr Centre for Human Rights at Harvard and the pitifully misled
\"anti-genocide\" movement]{.underline}. **[All promote an absolutist
view of human rights permeated by modern western ideas that westerners
mistakenly call \"universal\".]{.underline}** In some cases, [their
work, far from saving lives, actually causes more death, more
repression, more brutality and an absolute weakening of human
rights.]{.underline}

Yet, because of its global reach, now extended by an amazing gift of
\$100m from George Soros -- which Hoge had a large part in arranging
--Human Rights Watch sets a global standard. In its early days, emerging
from the human rights clauses in the 1975 Helsinki Accords, it was the
receptacle of the world\'s innocent but urgent goal of basic rights for
all. [Just as Human Rights Watch led **the** **human rights community**
as it arose, it is now the poster child for a movement that **has become
a spear-carrier for the \"exceptionalist\" belief that the west has a
providential right to intervene wherever in the world it
wishes.**]{.underline}

For many years as a foreign correspondent, I not only worked alongside
human rights advocates, but considered myself one of them. To defend the
rights of those who have none was the reason I became a journalist in
the first place. Now, I see the human rights movement as opposing human
rights.

[The problem is its narrow, egocentric definition of what human rights
are.]{.underline}

[Those who have traditionally run Human Rights Watch and other
western-based groups that pursue comparable goals come from societies
where crucial group rights -- the right not to be murdered on the
street, the right not to be raped by soldiers, the right to go to
school, the right to clean water, the right not to starve -- have long
since been guaranteed. In their societies, it makes sense to defend
secondary rights, like the right to form a radical newspaper or an
extremist political party. **But in many countries, there is a stark
choice between one set of rights and the other**]{.underline}. [Human
rights groups, bathed in the light of self-admiration and cultural
superiority, too often make the wrong choice.]{.underline}

[The actions of human rights do-gooders is craziest in Darfur, where
they show themselves not only dangerously naive but also unwilling to
learn lessons from their past misjudgments.]{.underline} [By their
well-intentioned activism, they have given murderous rebel militias
--]{.underline} not only in Darfur but [**around the world --** the idea
that even if they have no hope of military victory, they can mobilise
useful idiots around the world to take up their cause, and thereby win
in the court of public opinion what they cannot win on the
battlefield.]{.underline} [The best way to do this is to provoke
massacres by the other side, which Darfur rebels have dome quite
successfully and remorselessly]{.underline}. [This mobilises
well-meaning American celebrities and the human rights groups behind
them. **It** also **prolongs war and makes human rights groups
accomplices to great crimes.**]{.underline}

This is a replay of the Biafra fiasco of the late 1960s. Remember? The
world was supposed to mobilise to defend Biafran rebels and prevent the
genocide that Nigeria would carry out if they were defeated. [Global
protests prolonged the war and caused countless deaths.]{.underline}
When the Biafrans were finally defeated, though, [the predicted genocide
never happened.]{.underline} [Fewer Biafrans would have starved to death
if Biafran leaders had not calculated that more starvation would stir up
support from human rights advocates in faraway countries]{.underline}.
[Rebels in Darfur have learned the value of mobilising western human
rights groups to prolong wars, and this lesson is working gloriously for
them.]{.underline}

The place where I finally broke with my former human-rights comrades was
Rwanda. The regime in power now is admired throughout Africa; 13 African
heads of state attended President Paul Kagame\'s recent inauguration, as
opposed to just one who came to the inauguration in neighbouring
Burundi[. The Rwandan regime has given more people a greater chance to
break out of extreme poverty than almost any regime in modern African
history -- and this after a horrific slaughter in 1994 from which many
outsiders assumed Rwanda would never recover. It is also a regime that
forbids ethnic speech, ethnically-based political parties and
ethnically-divisive news media -- and uses these restrictions to enforce
its permanence in power.]{.underline}

By my standards, this authoritarian regime is the best thing that has
happened to Rwanda since colonialists arrived a century ago. My own
experience tells me that [people in Rwanda are happy with it, thrilled
at their future prospects, and not angry that there is not a wide enough
range of newspapers or political parties. Human Rights Watch, however,
portrays the Rwandan regime as brutally oppressive. Giving people jobs,
electricity, and above all security is not considered a human rights
achievement; limiting political speech and arresting violators is
considered unpardonable]{.underline}.

[Human Rights Watch wants Rwandans to be able to speak freely
about]{.underline} their [ethnic hatreds, and to allow political parties
connected with the defeated genocide army to campaign freely for
power]{.underline}. It has come to this: all that is necessary for
another genocide to happen in Rwanda is for the Rwandan government to
follow the path recommended by Human Rights Watch.

This is why the appointment of James Hoge, who took office in October,
is so potentially important. **[The human rights movement lost its way
by considering human rights in a vacuum, as if there are absolutes
everywhere and white people in New York are best-equipped to decide what
they are.]{.underline}**
