USMCA WORKING GROUPS GET TO IT: House [Democrats' Trade Working Group
features nine members tasked with **resolving Democratic
demands**]{.underline} to overhaul certain parts of the new NAFTA deal.
House Speaker Nancy [Pelosi named lawmakers]{.underline} to the group
[this week,]{.underline} [**setting in motion** a **process for
negotiating**]{.underline} with the Trump administration. House Ways and
Means Chairman Richard Neal will lead the group. Who's on: The group is
divided into [four subgroups: drug pricing, labor, environment and
enforcement]{.underline}. Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Jan
Schakowsky (D-Ill.) will lead the drug pricing team. Reps. Jimmy Gomez
(D-Calif.) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) will head up the labor group.
Reps. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.) and John Larson (D-Conn.) will tackle
environmental issues. Reps. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.) and Rosa DeLauro
(D-Conn.) will work on enforcement. **[White House is
hopeful:]{.underline}** White House chief economic adviser Larry [Kudlow
said he met recently with]{.underline} President Donald [Trump
and]{.underline} U.S. Trade Representative Robert
[Lighthizer]{.underline} and indicated the administration is still
deferring to Pelosi on timing for bringing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement to the floor. [Republicans are pressing for a vote on the deal
before the August recess]{.underline} or shortly after lawmakers return
from the month-long break, but it's unclear how quickly Pelosi's team
will work with Lighthizer. "[I think, if and when the speaker gives us a
vote, yeah**, I think it will pass**]{.underline}. I wouldn't dare
predict timing," Kudlow said at a Thursday event at the Peterson
Institute for International Economics. "As I said earlier, I think [the
speaker has been very accommodative to us, given us **a fair hearing**
on it]{.underline}. **[So, let's be hopeful]{.underline}**."

#### Trump will veto the aff\-\--fiat means congress overrides it.

**Anderson 19** \-\-- Scott R. Anderson, David M. Rubenstein fellow in
Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, (\"Untangling the Yemen
Arms Sales Debate,\" 6-14-2019, Lawfare,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/untangling-yemen-arms-sales-debate, accessed
6-19-2019)

Notably, there was initially a [parliamentary
question](https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/bipartisan-senate-group-seek-block-saudi-arms-sales-trump-administration-tries-avoid-congressional-review)
as to whether **[joint resolutions on arms sales]{.underline}** moved
forward under the emergency exception could qualify for the Section 601
expedited procedures---an ineligibility, perhaps, that the Trump
administration had been relying on. The Senate parliamentarian appears
to have resolved this question in favor of the resolutions' sponsors, as
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has since
[confirmed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-10/senate-republicans-join-in-rebuke-of-trump-over-saudi-arms-sales)
that a vote to move the resolutions out of committee could take place as
soon as next week. Moreover, unlike concurrent resolutions in the
original AECA, any joint resolutions that are enacted into law through
these procedures will be free-standing legislation with independent
force of law. As a result, the resolutions' directive that each of the
22 specified transactions "is prohibited" should still be binding on the
executive branch. That said, it seems unlikely that any of the joint
resolutions will reach this stage. [Given that each is co-sponsored by
four Republican senators]{.underline}, [they seem to have the minimum
votes necessary to pass the Senate as well as the Democrat-controlled
House]{.underline}. **[But Trump is almost certain to veto
them]{.underline}**, and it seems unlikely that two-thirds of both the
House and the Senate will support an effort to override these vetoes. As
a result, [the outcome here is likely to resemble the outcome of the
Yemen war powers debate, with Trump using his veto to continue to pursue
his **increasingly unpopular Yemen policies** over **bipartisan
objections**]{.underline}. But to arrive here, the Trump administration
will have to weather many more rounds of floor debate that will put
bipartisan objections to the president's Yemen policies on full display
and associate his Republican allies with an increasingly unpopular war.
And the numerous vetoes Trump will have to deploy will no doubt make
clear to what extent he is pursuing those policies without the support
of Congress.

#### An unsuccessful veto [obliterates]{.underline} Trump's PC.

**Zipperer 18** \-\-- Eddie Zipperer, political science professor at
Georgia Military College, opinion writer for The Hill, ("Why Vetoing The
Omnibus Could Have Been Disastrous For Trump", 3-26-2018, Daily Caller,
https://dailycaller.com/2018/03/26/why-vetoing-the-omnibus-could-have-been-disastrous-for-trump/)

Remember all those checks and balances from your high school Civics
class? Sure the President can veto a bill passed by Congress, but then
Congress can veto the veto. What they don't teach in that civics class
are the implications of a veto override. [If Trump had been overridden
the very first time he ever exercised the veto power]{.underline}, [it
would have sent the message that Congress has the final say---that
Congress is in charge, and the president, who is being investigated by a
special council]{.underline}, is up to his ears in sex scandals being
pushed by the mainstream media, and whose approval rating hovers around
40 percent, **[is a lame-duck rubber stamp]{.underline}**. [It would
have been a disastrous rebuke]{.underline} of President Trump, [and it
would have dealt a **severe blow** to his]{.underline} already-overdrawn
account of **[political capital]{.underline}**. Throughout American
history, the average Presidential success rate when exercising the veto
is about 88 percent. Only around 20 times has a president had a veto
overridden when his party controlled both houses of Congress. That
hasn't happened to any president since it happened to one-term-disaster
Jimmy Carter 38 years ago.

#### USMCA is key to sustaining global life science innovation.

Toronto Faculty of Law; with Stephen Ezell, Vice President for Global

accessed 6-17-2019)

[The revised NAFTA agreement]{.underline} --- [now the]{.underline}
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([USMCA]{.underline}) --- [has been making
progress]{.underline}, and Canada is now proceeding with ratification of
the deal. However, a challenge standing in the way of full ratification
is objections to some of the life-sciences, copyright, and other
intellectual property (IP) provisions established in USMCA's Chapter 20.
[One provision under consideration addresses data protection for
biologics]{.underline}. A "biologic" is a large molecule drug made from
complex biological processes --- much more complex than the simple
chemical compounds used for more common drugs we take as pills. Their
complexity means [these drugs tend to be newer and more advanced, but
also more difficult and expensive to develo]{.underline}p. [**Extended
protection** of the clinical trial data]{.underline} demonstrating the
safety and efficacy of biologic drugs, [which the USMCA **obliges member
nations** to **provide at a 10-year minimum term**]{.underline}, [helps
facilitate **biologic drugs' development**, offering **additional
protection** for a biologic **beyond patents**]{.underline} on the
molecular compound or biofabrication process alone. It works by delaying
the ability of a knock-off drug to use the innovator's clinical trial
and related data to qualify for sale. [Ten years may seem like a long
time]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} research indicates that [drugs
commonly take more than 12 years to recoup the investment]{.underline}
in research that makes them possible. The United States already exceeds
the ten-year minimum requirement by offering data protection for 12
years. However, Canada and Mexico fall below this standard; Canada
offers data protection for only eight years, and Mexico offers no
biologic-specific data protection. [Establishing this 10-year
requirement would **level the playing field** for **innovation in all
countries**]{.underline}, [help **attract** additional **life-sciences**
**r**esearch **and** **d**evelopment into Canada and
Mexico]{.underline}, [and **spur more life-sciences investment** in the
United States.]{.underline} While the United States already observes
stronger data protection than would be required under Chapter 20, the
provision has drawn some criticism. [Some unions]{.underline}, medical,
and faith-based groups, as well as civil society organizations, recently
sent a letter to Congress opposing additional market exclusivity for
biologics. They [argue that the USMCA would "entrench and expand
prescription drug monopoly protections]{.underline}, [thwart
competition]{.underline} [and]{.underline} thus [undermine efforts to
expand access to affordable medicines]{.underline}." **[This argument is
deeply misguided]{.underline}**, [and it **threatens future
life-sciences innovation**]{.underline}. The market for biosimilars
(essentially a generic of a biotech drug) is not the same as for generic
versions of simpler, old-style drugs. It costs far more to develop and
seek approval for a biosimilar, and cost reductions will be around 30
percent (estimates range from 8 to 43 percent) --- not the steep
discounts we see with generic pharmaceutical drugs. And while
competition between biologics and "biosimilars" is indeed useful, what
matters most is competition between proprietary biologics. Such
competition is far more beneficial than competition with knock-off drugs
because it is driven by innovation, creating new-to-the-world medicines
and bringing more effective and patient-friendly delivery mechanisms to
the fore. [Reasonable data protection rules give companies developing
new biotech drugs the right incentives to keep making these highly
risky, yet beneficial, investments]{.underline}. [Thanks to **IP
protections** and a **vibrant American life-sciences innovation
ecosystem**, **competition** among proprietary biologics is **robust**.
America's robust IP protections for biologic drugs are one key reason
why the United States **leads the world** in **life-sciences
innovation**. IP protections ensure **continued innovation** that leads
to important **medical advances** and **cures**]{.underline}. These also
create good jobs and support U.S. competitiveness and exports. And as
part of the USMCA, they facilitate commerce between two of our most
important trading partners. The United States must stand up for
innovation in the debate over the USMCA. It must make the case that
Chapter 20 is beneficial not just for the United States, but for Canada
and Mexico as well. [**Without U.S. leadership**, American]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} by extension, **[global life-sciences innovation could
diminish]{.underline}**, [taking medical advances]{.underline}, economic
[growth, and good jobs with it]{.underline}. [The U.S. must stand up for
life-sciences innovation throughout North America and **forge ahead with
USMCA** ratification **now**.]{.underline}

#### Solves disease\-\--[extinction]{.underline}.

**Sachs 14** (Jeffrey, Professor of Sustainable Development, Health
Policy and Management @ Columbia University, Director of the Earth
Institute @ Columbia University and Special adviser to the United
Nations Secretary-General on the Millennium Development Goals,
"Important lessons from Ebola outbreak," Business World Online, August
17, 2014, <http://tinyurl.com/kjgvyro>)

[Ebola **is the latest of many**]{.underline} recent
**[epidemics]{.underline}**, also [**including** AIDS, SARS, H1N1 **flu,
H7N9 flu**]{.underline}, and others. AIDS is the deadliest of these
killers, claiming nearly 36 million lives since 1981. Of course, [even
larger **and more sudden epidemics are possible**]{.underline}, [such as
the 1918 influenza]{.underline} during World War I, [which claimed
**50-100 million lives**]{.underline} (far more than the war itself).
And, though the 2003 SARS outbreak was contained, causing fewer than
1,000 deaths, the disease was on the verge of deeply disrupting several
East Asian economies including China's. **[There are four crucial facts
to understand about]{.underline}** Ebola and the other
**[epidemics]{.underline}**. First, **[most emerging infectious
diseases]{.underline}** are zoonoses, meaning that they **[start in
animal populations]{.underline}**, sometimes **[with a genetic mutation
that enables the jump to humans]{.underline}**. Ebola may have been
transmitted from bats; HIV/AIDS emerged from chimpanzees; SARS most
likely came from civets traded in animal markets in southern China; and
influenza strains such as H1N1 and H7N9 arose from genetic
re-combinations of viruses among wild and farm animals. [**New zoonotic
diseases are inevitable** as humanity pushes into new
ecosystems]{.underline} (such as formerly remote forest regions); [the
food industry creates **more** conditions for genetic recombination; and
climate change scrambles natural habitats **and species
interactions**]{.underline}. Second, [once a new infectious disease
appears, its spread]{.underline} through airlines, ships, megacities,
and trade in animal products [is likely to be extremely
rapid]{.underline}. These epidemic diseases are new markers of
globalization, revealing through their chain of death how vulnerable the
world has become from the pervasive movement of people and goods. Third,
the poor are the first to suffer and the worst affected. The rural poor
live closest to the infected animals that first transmit the disease.
They often hunt and eat bushmeat, leaving them vulnerable to infection.
Poor, often illiterate, individuals are generally unaware of how
infectious diseases \-- especially unfamiliar diseases \-- are
transmitted, making them much more likely to become infected and to
infect others. Moreover, given poor nutrition and lack of access to
basic health services, their weakened immune systems are easily overcome
by infections that better nourished and treated individuals can survive.
And "de-medicalized" conditions \-- with few if any professional health
workers to ensure an appropriate public-health response to an epidemic
(such as isolation of infected individuals, tracing of contacts,
surveillance, and so forth) \-- make initial outbreaks more severe.
Finally, [**the required** medical]{.underline} responses, including
diagnostic tools and effective medications and vaccines, inevitably lag
behind the emerging diseases. In any event, such [tools must be
**continually replenished**. This requires **cutting-edge biotechnology,
immunology, and**]{.underline} ultimately [**bioengineering** to create
**large-scale** industrial responses]{.underline} (**[such as millions
of doses of vaccines or medicines]{.underline}** in the case of large
epidemics). The AIDS crisis, for example, called forth tens of billions
of dollars for research and development \-- [and similarly substantial
commitments by the pharmaceutical industry]{.underline} \-- to produce
lifesaving antiretroviral drugs at global scale. Yet each breakthrough
inevitably leads to the pathogen's mutation, rendering previous
treatments less effective. [There is no ultimate victory, only a
**constant arms race between humanity and disease-causing
agents**]{.underline}.

WASHINGTON---[The]{.underline} U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade [agreement has
"a **better than two-thirds chance"** of passing through Congress this
year]{.underline}, President [Trump's acting chief of staff said
Tuesday]{.underline}, [adding its approval depends on **support among
House Democrats.**]{.underline} Speaking at The Wall Street Journal CFO
Network meeting, Mick [Mulvaney said the successor deal to the North
American Free Trade Agreement has many supporters in the
House]{.underline}, [and a **likely majority** in the **full
chamber**]{.underline}, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) is
unlikely to bring it to the floor without a clear majority of Democrats.
["I don't think Nancy can bring it to the floor until she has something
approaching the majority]{.underline}" in her own party, he said. "[We
know there are **champions of this bill in the House**]{.underline}. [We
know that **labor supports it**; we know that **agriculture supports
it**; we know that **manufacturing supports it,**]{.underline} although
the typical Rust Belt Democrats---that's their base, they support this
deal and they know that it's better than Nafta." Mrs. Pelosi has
signaled they won't allow a vote on USMCA without certain changes,
including easier enforcement of new rules designed to strengthen labor
rights in Mexico. The deal must still be ratified by the U.S., Canada
and Mexico to go into effect. In her own comments Monday, Mrs. Pelosi
said enforcing the new provisions was key. Labor rights are central to
her base, which wants to raise wages in Mexico to reduce the incentive
to ship jobs outside the U.S. "[I thought that would be the **easiest
trade bill we've ever had the opportunity to pass** because those who
are unhappy with Nafta really want to have a new Nafta]{.underline},"
Mrs. Pelosi said at an event at the Peterson Foundation. "If you don't
have enforcement, you're just having Nafta again with sprinkles on top."

[Even amid rising tensions from Trump's tariff]{.underline} threat,
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez [Obrador has reaffirmed his
support for the new Nafta deal]{.underline}. [Its **prospects in
Mexico's Congress** are good]{.underline}, [given the **support of Lopez
Obrador**]{.underline}, whose party controls the nation's legislative
branch. [Major opposition parties also want it to be
enacted]{.underline}. Nonetheless, the tariff confrontation may have
created lasting damage to ties between the two countries. Republicans
previously pleaded with Trump to remove steel and aluminum tariffs on
Canada and Mexico, and they've publicly worried about the lasting impact
of changes to global commerce as a result of Trump's multi-front trade
wars. Even as Trump retains some bipartisan support for taking a hard
stance against Chinese trade practices, few lawmakers wanted him to rip
up the accord with Mexico and Canada without a replacement. [The USMCA
came together after more than a year of painstaking
negotiations]{.underline}. [Senator]{.underline} Thom
[Tillis]{.underline}, [a North Carolina Republican]{.underline} [who's
up for re-election in 2020]{.underline}, [said he has **"no doubt''**
there's **enough support** in the Senate to **ratify the
agreement**]{.underline}. With help from pro-trade Republicans, Tillis
said Sunday on Fox, [the **Democratic-led House** should be **able to
pass it as well.**]{.underline} "Now that we've gotten the threat of

faith even as they fear that Trump could once again threaten
Mexico]{.underline} if he feels pressure over migration. The key
sticking point may be how to improve enforcement. Under the original
NAFTA, its provisions are enforced by binding arbitration panels. Those
are no longer used because the country accused of a violation can simply
block the formation of a panel. Democrats are mulling whether to propose
outlawing panel-blocking under the new agreement. Rhode Island

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - [Mexico on Wednesday became the **first country

(**[USMCA]{.underline}**) agreed late last year to replace the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) at the behest of U.S. President
Donald Trump. [By a vote of **114 in favor to 4 against**]{.underline},
[Mexico's Senate backed the deal tortuously negotiated]{.underline}
between 2017 and 2018 after Trump repeatedly threatened to withdraw from
NAFTA if he could not get a better trade agreement for the United
States. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had already
anticipated ratification this week in the Senate, where his leftist
National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and its allies have a
comfortable majority in the 128-member chamber. [There has been little
parliamentary opposition in Mexico]{.underline} to trying to safeguard
market access to United States, by far Mexico's top export destination,
and the trade deal was approved with overwhelming cross-party support in
the Senate. Mexico sends around 80% of its exports to the United States,
and Trump last month vowed to impose tariffs on all Mexican goods if
Lopez Obrador does not reduce the flow of U.S.-bound illegal immigration
from Central America. Lopez Obrador says he wants to avoid conflict with
Trump, but noted at the weekend that the tariff dispute showed Mexico
needed to become more economically self-sufficient. [Trump
congratulated]{.underline} Lopez [Obrador]{.underline} on Twitter [for
Mexico's approval. "Time for Congress to do the same here!" he
wrote.]{.underline} Lopez Obrador, meanwhile, posted a video on Twitter
in which he called the Senate's approval "very good news" and said it
augured well for Mexico's relations with the United States.

[It\'s not often in the current political climate that we hear kind
words from one side of the aisle to the other]{.underline}, but this was
one of those days. [With]{.underline} farmers and other [supporters of
the]{.underline} United States, Canada, Mexico Agreement, or
[USMCA]{.underline}, hoping [for ratification this year]{.underline},
Senator [Grassley says **he\'s satisfied** with **efforts by the
Democrat Speaker** of the House to get it done. The House **must pass
the trade deal first**]{.underline}, but cannot take action until the
White House sends over the final text of the bill. The White House
won\'t do that until the Speaker signals she has the votes for passage.
Senator [Grassley]{.underline} says he spoke with Speaker Nancy Pelosi
about this last week and [understands why she has been **unable to
promise the votes yet**]{.underline}. The Senator says [it is difficult
because of the large number of **first-term house members** than **need
to be educated** on a complex trade dea]{.underline}l tackling a large
and diverse range of the U.S. economy. Grassley says [the Speaker is
**working hard** to get the job done. Grassley **remains optimistic**
that the deal will get done before the late-summer recess]{.underline}
on Capitol Hill. He admits failure to pass the trade deal that would
replace NAFTA this year would be devastating. That\'s because dragging
the debate into 2020 would make it a hot political issue in a highly
contentious presidential campaign season.

**[House Democrats are expressing optimism]{.underline}** [as they begin

formally name lawmakers to the working groups that will work with the
administration on the labor, environment and pharmaceutical
provisions]{.underline} that Democrats are seeking to strengthen. Pelosi
has also emphasized the need for strong enforcement mechanisms in the
accord that will overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement. [Ways

[Massachusetts Democrat]{.underline} leading talks with U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Lighthizer, [said]{.underline} Monday [**he hopes
a deal can be finalized** within **30 days**.]{.underline} The Trump
administration has signaled plans to send a bill implementing the USMCA
to Congress by the end of the month to prod lawmakers to vote on it
before the August recess. [These signs of progress come after Trump
withdrew his threat to impose tariffs on Mexican imports]{.underline}
over unrelated immigration concerns. Senate [Republicans applauded that
decision,]{.underline} and Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley met
Monday with Pelosi, Neal and Ways and Means Republican Kevin Brady to
discuss how to move forward on the USMCA. "We just wanted to point out
despite the chaotic nature of the tariff situation, we still wanted to
stitch this up," Neal said. Grassley requested that meeting, and he told
House Democrats he wants to be helpful in completing the USMCA,
according to a Democratic aide. Pelosi used the meeting to explain the
provisions that need to be reinforced to get more House Democrats to
support the deal, the aide said. "**[We want to be on a path to
yes,"]{.underline}** Pelosi said at a Peterson Foundation event Tuesday,
[stressing the need for strong enforcement]{.underline}. If all parties
can't be held to the agreement, she said, "you're just having NAFTA with
sprinkles on top." [Grassley described Monday's meeting with Pelosi as
**"very successful."**]{.underline} "I think [they're putting a
good-faith effort to work out differences]{.underline}," Grassley said
of House Democrats. "There's a process in place to do it. But those
differences will have to be worked out before we move it. The Senate
Finance Committee will hold a hearing June 18 with Lighthizer to discuss
the USMCA, Grassley later said in a statement. For weeks [Republicans
have said that the USMCA **already has enough votes to
pass**]{.underline}, [counting on a combination of **pro-trade
lawmakers** from **both parties**]{.underline}. Acting White House Chief
of Staff Mick [Mulvaney said]{.underline} Tuesday "[**everybody knows**
it will **pass the House**]{.underline}," but suggested that Pelosi is
holding out to get not only a majority of the full House of
Representatives, but also a majority of her caucus.

"Confirmation Wars and Collateral Damage: Assessing the Impact of
Supreme Court Nominations on Presidential Success in the U.S. Senate,"
pg online @
http://spia.uga.edu/faculty_pages/ajmadonn/Presidential%20Capital.pdf

It is "often overlooked" that presidents "operate in a world they do not
control" (Beckmann 2010, 13). Supreme Court vacancies yield important
(and often unexpected) additions to the president's "to do" list.
Despite the president's power to influence the legislative agenda and
achieve confirmation for his judicial nominees, [unanticipated exogenous
shocks can distract from]{.underline} these [priorities]{.underline}.
[**These** events]{.underline} **[divert lawmakers' efforts to new
concerns at the expense of preexisting agenda items]{.underline}**.
[Exogenous shocks cost]{.underline} president's [**time, resources, and
attention** previously devoted to other endeavors]{.underline}. We
theorize that Supreme Court vacancies and the nominations that follow
function as exogenous shocks to the presidential agenda and influence
success in both the legislative arena and the lower court confirmation
process.8 [Political scientists have established that exogenous events
influence]{.underline} presidential [success]{.underline}, but their
interest has been devoted primarily to major domestic or national
security crises (Beckmann 2010; Lebo and Cassino 2007). Those events
often, but not always, demand immediate and ongoing attention. Despite
the substantive differences between Supreme Court nominations and other
types of exogenous events, we argue that they share many of their
characteristics. Once a Supreme Court justice leaves office or declares
her intention to do so, the president is responsible for selecting her
successor. The vetting and confirmation processes require presidents'
attention and time, both of which are scarce goods for political elites
(Jones and Baumgartner 2005; Oppenheimer 1985). The amount of time and
political capital spent on a Supreme Court nominee is largely dependent
on the ideology of the president and key legislators (Johnson and
Roberts 2004, 2005). Presidents want to select nominees in line with
their own ideological preferences, but must take into account the
preferences of key senators (Moraski and Shipan 1999). The statement by
Senator Reid suggests that Supreme Court nominations can distract
legislators despite rational selection behavior by presidents. As a
result, Supreme Court nominees can occupy time that would be allocated
to different priorities. **[Time is a valuable commodity in the
Senate]{.underline}**. [Its value has increased as the number of bills
introduced has grown, obstruction has become commonplace, and party
polarization has increased]{.underline}. In other words, [senatorial
time has been filled by two major sources: the sheer volume of
bills]{.underline} (many of which are trivial but must be considered)
**[and more extensive time spent debating the bills that are
controversial]{.underline}**. [Eventually, these increased demands on
the time of Congress have policy consequences because sessions expire
before important legislation can be considered and passed]{.underline}
(Oppenheimer 1985). [Majority party leadership in the Senate lacks the
ability to issue restrictive floor rules and small groups or individuals
from either party can obstruct the legislative process]{.underline}.
Despite the presence of a cloture rule allowing three-fifths of the
chamber to end debate, [incidents of obstruction have increased fairly
dramatically]{.underline} in the latter half of the twentieth century
(Binder 1997; Koger 2010; Wawro and Schickler 2004, 2006). [Even when
the Senate majority can muster a supermajority for cloture, the process
is still fairly time consuming]{.underline}. The vote on a cloture
petition can occur only after it lies over for two calendar days. Then,
an additional 30 hours of debate and amending activity can occur before
a final vote is taken on the measure. Given the large number of judicial
nominations, moving cloture on all or many of them is untenable. As
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) noted in 2010, "there isn't
enough time in the world -- the Senate world, at least -- to move
cloture on every one of these \[judicial nominations\]" (Wilson and
Murray 2010).

[The GOP-led Senate will vote on measures that could **stop** the
**Trump** administration from **pushing through arms sales** to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} over congressional objections, [according
to]{.underline} Majority Leader Mitch [McConnell]{.underline},
[**potentially tying up Senate floor time** and putting some of the
president's **closest allies at odds** with part of his foreign policy.
Some Republicans]{.underline} have [criticized]{.underline} President
Donald [Trump's decision to push ahead with]{.underline} \$8 billion in
[arms sales]{.underline} to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast countries
[despite congressional opposition]{.underline}. They have also urged
stronger consequences for the kingdom's role in the killing of columnist
Jamal Khashoggi. McConnell said he is "as offended as everyone is by the
behavior of the Saudis on the Khashoggi case," but he warned against
"fracturing the relationship we have with the Saudis \-- one of our best
allies against our Iranian enemies." With Senator Mike Lee joining
Republican Senators Lindsey Graham, Rand Paul and Todd Young in
cosponsoring 22 resolutions to disapprove of the sales, McConnell
acknowledged that the vote will go ahead. However, McConnell said he
supports the underlying arms sales and predicted that the Senate will
not have enough votes to override a Trump veto of Congress's attempt to
stop them. Lawmakers, even Republicans, have been unsettled over Trump's
repeated use of emergency declarations to bypass Congress on matters of
foreign policy, government spending and potentially trade and
immigration. The disagreement over selling defense systems to Saudi
Arabia \-- a traditional U.S. ally \-- is further complicated by
increased tensions in the Middle East as the Trump administration warns
that regional forces associated with Iran have stepped up their threats.
The Democratic-led House will hold a Wednesday hearing to discuss the
arms sale, with testimony from [R. Clarke
Cooper](https://www.state.gov/biographies/r-clarke-cooper/), assistant
secretary for political-military affairs. Cooper will cite signs of
Iranian aggression as justification for approving these deals, according
to excerpts of his prepared testimony. "These sales and the associated
emergency certification are intended to address the military need of our
partners in the face of an urgent regional threat posed by Iran; promote
the vitality of our bilateral relationships by reassuring our partners;
and preserve strategic advantage against near-peer competitors,"
Cooper's advance statement says. 'Deeply Problematic' This argument has
failed to convince Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, who introduced the resolutions last week to
gut the emergency declaration the Trump administration is using to push
the arms sales forward without congressional approval. The resolutions
need 51 votes to be discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee, so
just four Republicans can force a vote if the Senate's 47 Democrats
support the measures. Each resolution provides for 10 hours of debate,
and [**that could tie up the Senate floor for 220 hours** if senators
can't agree to handle the resolutions as one block]{.underline},
according to Menendez.

even greater with the approach of deadlines]{.underline} such as the
date for adjournment and the end of the fiscal year. So, for all but the
most important bills, even the threat of a filibuster can be a potent
weapon. Before a bill reaches the floor or while it is being debated,
its supporters often seek ways to accommodate the concerns of opponents,
preferring an amended bill that can be passed without protracted debate
to the time, effort, and risks involved in confronting a filibuster or
the threat of one.

Democrats on new NAFTA," Politico,
https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/07/trump-nafta-democrats-1247064

[The White House is engineering an unusually **by-the-book
approach**]{.underline} [for selling Congress on]{.underline} the
[replacement]{.underline} deal for [NAFTA]{.underline} --- [with the
hope of persuading]{.underline} Speaker Nancy [Pelosi]{.underline} to
hold a vote for the new trade agreement. [Administration officials have
been organizing dozens of meetings with]{.underline} rank-and-file
[lawmakers to try to build bipartisan support for the deal]{.underline},
which restructures trade terms with Canada and Mexico. [They're hoping
to recapture the success of criminal justice reform legislation, which
marked a rare high-point for White House-Hill relations]{.underline} and
passed Congress last year following a monthslong behind-the-scenes
campaign led by Jared Kushner. Their goal is to get a vote on the pact
by late summer. But their efforts still may come to nothing: While
Pelosi hasn't yet staked out a definitive position on the agreement,
factions of Democrats are already saying they're not going to vote for
it unless there are changes to key provisions, possibly requiring new
negotiations with the two U.S. trading partners. Plus, Democrats and GOP
lawmakers alike are telling the president they won't consider the deal
until he lifts lingering tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico and
Canada. "Look, **[it's going to be very hard to do this]{.underline}**,"
said Rep. Richard Neal, chairman of the influential House Ways and Means
Committee. [With few legislative options on the horizon, passing the new
pact has taken an outsize importance for]{.underline} the
administration, especially as [Trump]{.underline} hones his reelection
message. White House aides said they are aware that the [divisive
politics]{.underline} of the upcoming election [could give Democrats
incentive to reject it]{.underline}. In recent weeks, senior officials
from [the White House]{.underline} and the U.S. Trade Representative's
office [have met with Ways and]{.underline} [Means]{.underline}
Committee members, the [House GOP whip team, the Problem Solvers caucus,
the Tuesday Group, the Hispanic Caucus and the Blue Dogs. Administration
officials are planning to soon meet with the New Democrats, who are
widely seen as a key coalition]{.underline} that will ultimately deliver
Democratic votes for the deal. Kushner, the president's son-in-law and
senior adviser, is taking the lead in the White House and Deputy U.S.
Trade Representative C.J. Mahoney is the point person at USTR, with
Robert Lighthizer, the administration's lead trade negotiator, regularly
meeting with lawmakers about the issue. [The strategy stands **in stark
contrast** with many of the administration's previous dealings with
Capitol Hill]{.underline}, from the failed effort to repeal Obamacare to
the tense negotiations over last year's \$1.3 trillion spending bill.

[At stake for the president and]{.underline} American l[awmakers is the

a path to passage]{.underline}**," said Edward Alden, senior fellow at
the Council on Foreign Relations. "The key for Democrats is whether the
labor unions are prepared at least not to oppose the USMCA. Without
active labor opposition, there will be a significant group of Democrats

by all three countries, it still must be ratified by each nation's
legislature \-- and particularly in the U.S., that's where it can go
sideways. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has the tough task
of convincing his boss that he needs to exercise patience with lawmakers
who eventually must approve his deal but are requiring changes.
Lighthizer doesn't have much wiggle room to satisfy a wide range of
concerns. He says he's willing to address demands through the
implementing bill that Congress will vote on, though he ruled out

[Free trade is at the heart of the US economy]{.underline}. Each year,
our companies sell more than \$2.5 trillion worth of goods and services
to customers around the world. [Of]{.underline} those
[exports]{.underline}, [nearly \$300 billion worth of exports go to
Mexico and another \$360 billion]{.underline} worth [go to
Canada]{.underline}, **[two key markets]{.underline}** for US
enterprise. The importance of these markets is the reason the US entered
into a trade agreement with our North American neighbors 25 years ago
and why President Donald Trump and his administration signed a new deal,
a better deal --- the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.
And now [it\'s time for Congress to reaffirm **how important trade**
with **Mexico** and **Canada** is **for the US economy**]{.underline}
and pass the USMCA. Our country recognizes the importance of these
markets. A quarter of a century ago, the US entered into a trade
agreement with our North American neighbors that helped to level the
playing field and reduce barriers to trade for American job creators.
But 25 years later, that trade agreement is no longer the best agreement
for US businesses. That\'s why Trump and his administration signed the
USMCA. As it goes in Washington, there are lawmakers on both sides of
the aisle who are not 100% pleased with the agreement. To me, that means
the Trump administration negotiated a balanced agreement that deserves
support from all members of Congress. The USMCA updates the old
agreement and ensures that American workers and families are put first.
[This is also a welcome agreement for industries that depend on free,
fair, rules-based trade with Canada and Mexico]{.underline}. America\'s
**[farmers]{.underline}**, **[ranchers]{.underline}**, **[auto
manufacturers]{.underline}**, [and **small businesses** are **set to
gain**]{.underline} once the USMCA is signed into law. [According to
the]{.underline} US **[I]{.underline}**nternational
**[T]{.underline}**rade **[C]{.underline}**ommission, [the USMCA will
create **176,000** US **jobs** and **add** over **\$68 billion** to the
**US economy**]{.underline} --- that is, in addition to the 12 million
jobs already in the US that are supported by trade with Canada and
Mexico. [This]{.underline} positive [report]{.underline} [suggests that
pro-growth policies promoting free, fair, and enforceable trade are a
win for American workers and job creators alike]{.underline}. Supporters
of the USMCA recognize that [this agreement contains provisions that
will help make American job creators **more competitive**]{.underline}.
[For **agriculture**]{.underline}, those [provisions provide increased
access to Canadian]{.underline} dairy [markets]{.underline}. [For
**manufacturing**, the USMCA establishes requirements that promote
American-made **cars** and **machinery**]{.underline} [as well as **new
worker protections**]{.underline} [to ensure American factory jobs do
not get **shipped overseas**]{.underline}. The economic boost comes from
a number of provisions in the USMCA that will help American businesses
and consumers, including increased access to Canadian dairy markets for
farmers and requirements that promote American-made cars and machinery
for manufacturers. [The USMCA also established new rules around
e-commerce]{.underline}, [making it easier for American small businesses
to connect and sell to customers in Mexico and Canada]{.underline}. The
USMCA is [also a winning proposition for]{.underline} American
[innovators because it strengthens **i**ntellectual-**p**roperty

economic and military confrontations breaks down, **[economic

spur economic growth. It will modernize North American trade in ways

Trump, however, may pursue populist, anti-globalization, and
protectionist [policies that hinder trade]{.underline} and restrict the
movement of labor and capital. And he has cast doubt on existing US
security guarantees by suggesting that he will force America's allies to
pay for more of their own defense. If Trump is serious about putting
"America first," his administration will shift US geopolitical strategy
toward isolationism and unilateralism, pursuing only the national
interests of the homeland. When the US pursued similar policies in the
1920s and 1930s, it [**helped sow the seeds of World War II**.
Protectionism]{.underline} -- starting with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff,
which affected thousands of imported goods -- [triggered retaliatory
trade and currency wars that worsened the Great Depression]{.underline}.
More important, [American isolationism]{.underline} -- based on a false
belief that the US was safely protected by two oceans --
[allowed]{.underline} Nazi [Germany and]{.underline} Imperial [Japan
to]{.underline} wage aggressive war and **[threaten the entire
world]{.underline}**. With the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941,
the US was finally forced to take its head out of the sand.
[Today]{.underline}, too, a US turn to isolationism and the [pursuit of
strictly US national interests may]{.underline} eventually **[lead to a
global conflict]{.underline}**. Even without the prospect of American
disengagement from Europe, the European Union and the eurozone already
appear to be disintegrating, particularly in the wake of the United
Kingdom's June Brexit vote and Italy's failed referendum on
constitutional reforms in December. Moreover, in 2017, extreme
anti-Europe left- or right-wing populist parties could come to power in
France and Italy, and possibly in other parts of Europe. Without active
US engagement in Europe, an aggressively revanchist Russia will step in.
Russia is already challenging the US and the EU in Ukraine, Syria, the
Baltics, and the Balkans, and it may capitalize on the EU's looming
collapse by reasserting its influence in the former Soviet bloc
countries, and supporting pro-Russia movements within Europe. If Europe
gradually loses its US security umbrella, no one stands to benefit more
than Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump's proposals also threaten
to exacerbate the situation in the Middle East. He has said that he will
make America energy independent, which entails abandoning US interests
in the region and becoming more reliant on domestically produced
greenhouse-gas-emitting fossil fuels. And he has maintained his position
that Islam itself, rather than just radical militant Islam, is
dangerous. This view, shared by Trump's incoming National Security
Adviser, General Michael Flynn, plays directly into Islamist militants'
own narrative of a clash of civilizations. Meanwhile, an "America first"
approach under Trump will likely worsen the longstanding Sunni-Shia
proxy wars between Saudi Arabia and Iran. And if the US no longer
guarantees its Sunni allies' security, all regional powers -- including
Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt -- might decide that they can
defend themselves only by acquiring nuclear weapons, and even more
deadly conflict will ensue. In Asia, US economic and military primacy
has provided decades of stability; but a rising China is now challenging
the status quo. US President Barack Obama's strategic "pivot" to Asia
depended primarily on enacting the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership,
which Trump has promised to scrap on his first day in office. Meanwhile,
China is quickly strengthening its own economic ties in Asia, the
Pacific, and Latin America through its "one belt, one road" policy, the
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the New Development Bank (formerly
known as the BRICS bank), and its own regional free-trade proposal to
rival the TPP. If the US gives up on its Asian allies such as the
Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan, those countries may have no choice
but to prostrate themselves before China; and other US allies, such as
Japan and India, may be forced to militarize and challenge China openly.
Thus, an American withdrawal from the region could very well eventually
precipitate a military conflict there. [As in the 1930s, when
protectionist]{.underline} and isolationist [US policies hampered global
economic growth and trade, and created]{.underline} the [conditions for
rising]{.underline} revisionist [powers to start a **world war**,
similar policy impulses could set the stage for new powers to challenge
and undermine the American-led international order]{.underline}. [An
isolationist Trump administration may]{.underline} see the wide oceans
to its east and west, and [think]{.underline} that increasingly
ambitious powers such as [Russia, China, and Iran pose no direct
threat]{.underline} to the homeland. [But the US is still a global
economic and financial power in a deeply interconnected
world]{.underline}. If [left unchecked, these countries
will]{.underline} eventually be able to **[threaten core US economic and
security interests]{.underline}** -- at home and abroad -- [especially
if they expand their **nuclear**]{.underline} and cyberwarfare
**[capacities]{.underline}**. The historical record is clear:
[**protectionism**, isolationism, and "America first" policies are a
**recipe for economic and military disaster**]{.underline}.

At the same time, we always have our eye on the latest technology and
tools that will make our farms and ranches more productive and more
efficient. I don't know a farmer or rancher who would pass up a good
deal that could make their business better. The same is true when it
comes to trade deals. When NAFTA was signed more than 25 years ago, it
was the best trade deal U.S. agriculture had ever seen. But [now there's
a new deal on offer]{.underline}---[the]{.underline} U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement or [USMCA]{.underline}. [We have a chance to trade in a great
agreement for an even better one.]{.underline} Since NAFTA went into
effect in 1994, U.S. ag exports to Canada and Mexico have more than
quadrupled, making these our number 1 and number 2 markets respectively.
In 2018 alone, we exported \$20.7 billion in ag products to Canada and
\$19 billion to Mexico. These markets have only grown in value for U.S.
farmers and ranchers. Over the last decade, ag exports have increased 27
percent to Canada and 23 percent to Mexico. But as good as NAFTA has
been, it's time for an upgrade: it's time for Congress to approve USMCA.
**[Without USMCA, our most critical markets hang in the
balance]{.underline}**. [Both Canada and Mexico have already signed
another deal that does not include the United States]{.underline}. The
Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership
replaces the TPP agreement that the U.S. agreed to but then backed out
of in 2017. [The CPTPP gives Canada and Mexico preferential trade
terms]{.underline} with nine other countries and gives those countries
better access to Canada's and Mexico's markets―[all while the ongoing
trade war hangs overhead, with tariffs **hurting U.S. agricultural
exports**]{.underline}. Just this week, Japan is following through on
its promises under the CPTPP and reducing its tariffs and raising its
quotas for ag products from CPTPP partners. [This is all the more reason
why we must bring the **USMCA across the finish line** and **secure our
valuable trade partnership** with our nearest neighbors]{.underline}.
[The USMCA is also important in setting the stage for other modern trade
agreements for U.S. agriculture]{.underline}. **[NAFTA needed to be
modernized]{.underline}**, [and the USMCA has bells and whistles that we
don't have under our existing trade agreements]{.underline}. Let's look
under the hood. For the U.S., it's the first trade agreement to deal
with approval of and trade in products of biotechnology. This groundwork
will be critical in agreements we pursue with other countries,
especially in the EU, the UK and Japan. [The new agreement broadens
access for U.S. dairy]{.underline} and finally brings an end to Canada's
unfair class 7 pricing scheme. These are wins we didn't see even under
TPP. Finally, USMCA will [bring greater access for poultry, improve
wheat grading standards, and make much-needed improvements to animal and
plant health protection standards]{.underline}. Finally, ratifying the
USMCA will show our top trading partners and other countries that the
United States and the trade negotiators who represent us mean business.
It would prove that our word and handshake can be trusted when we strike
a deal. Right now, it's important for each of us to call on our
lawmakers in Washington and tell them **[how important the USMCA is to
agriculture]{.underline}**. [Farmers and ranchers are
resilient]{.underline}, [but our businesses---not to mention the jobs
and rural communities that depend on us---**cannot survive without our
top markets.**]{.underline} [Let's get this deal done, so we can move
forward with opening and **expanding more markets around the
globe.**]{.underline}

migration challenges which create incubators for extremist and
anti-American government factions]{.underline}. Our response cannot be
one dimensional but instead must be a nuanced and comprehensive National
Security Strategy combining all elements of National Power including a
Food Security Strategy. [An **American Food Security Strategy** is an
imperative factor in **reducing the multiple threats impacting our
National wellbeing.**]{.underline} [Recent history has shown that
**reliable food supplies and stable prices produce more stable and
secure countries.** Conversely, food insecurity, particularly in poorer
countries, can lead to instability, unrest, and violence. **Food
insecurity** drives **mass migration** around the world from the Middle
East, to Africa, to Southeast Asia, destabilizing neighboring
populations, **generating conflicts**, and threatening our own security
by **disrupting** our **economic, military, and diplomatic
relationships**.]{.underline} [Food system shocks from extreme
food-price volatility can be correlated with protests and
riots.]{.underline} Food price related protests toppled governments in
Haiti and Madagascar in 2007 and 2008. In 2010 and in 2011, food prices
and grievances related to food policy were one of the major drivers of
the Arab Spring uprisings. Repeatedly, history has taught us that [**a
strong agricultural sector** is **an unquestionable requirement**
for]{.underline} inclusive and sustainable growth, broad-based
development progress, and **[long-term stability]{.underline}**. The
impact can be remarkable and far reaching. [**Rising income**, in
addition to reducing the opportunities for an upsurge in extremism,
leads to changes in diet, producing **demand** for more diverse and
nutritious foods provided, in many cases, from **American farmers** and
ranchers.]{.underline} [**Emerging markets** currently purchase **20
percent of U.S. agriculture** exports and that figure is **expected to
grow** as populations boom.]{.underline} Moving early to ensure
stability in strategically significant regions requires long term
planning and a disciplined, thoughtful strategy. To combat current
threats and work to prevent future ones, our national leadership must
employ the entire spectrum of our power including diplomatic, economic,
and cultural elements. The best means to prevent future chaos and the
resulting instability is positive engagement addressing the causes of
instability before it occurs. This is not rocket science. We know where
the instability is most likely to occur. The world population will grow
by 2.5 billion people by 2050. Unfortunately, this massive population
boom is projected to occur primarily in the most fragile and food
insecure countries. This alarming math is not just about total numbers.
Projections show that the greatest increase is in the age groups most
vulnerable to extremism. There are currently 200 million people in
Africa between the ages of 15 and 24, with that number expected to
double in the next 30 years. Already, 60% of the unemployed in Africa
are young people. Too often **[these situations deteriorate into
shooting wars]{.underline}** requiring the deployment of our military
forces. We should be continually mindful that the price we pay for
committing military forces is measured in our most precious national
resource, the blood of those who serve. For those who live in **[rural
America]{.underline}**, this has a disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of
those who serve in our military come from the farms, ranches, and
non-urban communities that make up only 16% of our population. Actions
taken now to increase agricultural sector jobs can provide economic
opportunity and stability for those unemployed youths while helping to
feed people. A recent report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs
identifies agriculture development as the core essential for providing
greater food security, economic growth, and population well-being. [Our
active support for **food security**, including agriculture development,
has helped **stabilize key regions** over the past 60 years. A robust
food security strategy, as a part of our overall security strategy, can
mitigate the growth of terrorism, build important relationships, and
support continued American economic and agricultural prosperity while
materially contributing to our Nation's and the world's
security.]{.underline}

[The revised NAFTA agreement]{.underline} --- [now the]{.underline}

is objections to some of the life-sciences, copyright, and other
intellectual property (IP) provisions established in USMCA's Chapter 20.
[One provision under consideration addresses data protection for
biologics]{.underline}. A "biologic" is a large molecule drug made from
complex biological processes --- much more complex than the simple
chemical compounds used for more common drugs we take as pills. Their
complexity means [these drugs tend to be newer and more advanced, but
also more difficult and expensive to develo]{.underline}p. [**Extended
protection** of the clinical trial data]{.underline} demonstrating the
safety and efficacy of biologic drugs, [which the USMCA **obliges member
nations** to **provide at a 10-year minimum term**]{.underline}, [helps
facilitate **biologic drugs' development**, offering **additional
protection** for a biologic **beyond patents**]{.underline} on the
molecular compound or biofabrication process alone. It works by delaying
the ability of a knock-off drug to use the innovator's clinical trial
and related data to qualify for sale. [Ten years may seem like a long
time]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} research indicates that [drugs
commonly take more than 12 years to recoup the investment]{.underline}
in research that makes them possible. The United States already exceeds
the ten-year minimum requirement by offering data protection for 12
years. However, Canada and Mexico fall below this standard; Canada
offers data protection for only eight years, and Mexico offers no
biologic-specific data protection. [Establishing this 10-year
requirement would **level the playing field** for **innovation in all

**r**esearch **and** **d**evelopment into Canada and
Mexico]{.underline}, [and **spur more life-sciences investment** in the
United States.]{.underline} While the United States already observes
stronger data protection than would be required under Chapter 20, the
provision has drawn some criticism. [Some unions]{.underline}, medical,
and faith-based groups, as well as civil society organizations, recently
sent a letter to Congress opposing additional market exclusivity for
biologics. They [argue that the USMCA would "entrench and expand
prescription drug monopoly protections]{.underline}, [thwart
competition]{.underline} [and]{.underline} thus [undermine efforts to
expand access to affordable medicines]{.underline}." **[This argument is
deeply misguided]{.underline}**, [and it **threatens future
life-sciences innovation**]{.underline}. The market for biosimilars
(essentially a generic of a biotech drug) is not the same as for generic
versions of simpler, old-style drugs. It costs far more to develop and
seek approval for a biosimilar, and cost reductions will be around 30
percent (estimates range from 8 to 43 percent) --- not the steep
discounts we see with generic pharmaceutical drugs. And while
competition between biologics and "biosimilars" is indeed useful, what
matters most is competition between proprietary biologics. Such
competition is far more beneficial than competition with knock-off drugs
because it is driven by innovation, creating new-to-the-world medicines
and bringing more effective and patient-friendly delivery mechanisms to
the fore. [Reasonable data protection rules give companies developing
new biotech drugs the right incentives to keep making these highly
risky, yet beneficial, investments]{.underline}. [Thanks to **IP
protections** and a **vibrant American life-sciences innovation
ecosystem**, **competition** among proprietary biologics is **robust**.
America's robust IP protections for biologic drugs are one key reason
why the United States **leads the world** in **life-sciences
innovation**. IP protections ensure **continued innovation** that leads
to important **medical advances** and **cures**]{.underline}. These also
create good jobs and support U.S. competitiveness and exports. And as
part of the USMCA, they facilitate commerce between two of our most
important trading partners. The United States must stand up for
innovation in the debate over the USMCA. It must make the case that
Chapter 20 is beneficial not just for the United States, but for Canada
and Mexico as well. [**Without U.S. leadership**, American]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} by extension, **[global life-sciences innovation could
diminish]{.underline}**, [taking medical advances]{.underline}, economic
[growth, and good jobs with it]{.underline}. [The U.S. must stand up for
life-sciences innovation throughout North America and **forge ahead with
USMCA** ratification **now**.]{.underline}

#### Solves disease\-\--[extinction]{.underline}.

**Sachs 14** (Jeffrey, Professor of Sustainable Development, Health
Policy and Management @ Columbia University, Director of the Earth
Institute @ Columbia University and Special adviser to the United
Nations Secretary-General on the Millennium Development Goals)
"Important lessons from Ebola outbreak," Business World Online, August
17, 2014, <http://tinyurl.com/kjgvyro>)

[Ebola **is the latest of many**]{.underline} recent
**[epidemics]{.underline}**, also [**including** AIDS, SARS, H1N1 **flu,
H7N9 flu**]{.underline}, and others. AIDS is the deadliest of these
killers, claiming nearly 36 million lives since 1981. Of course, [even
larger **and more sudden epidemics are possible**]{.underline}, [such as
the 1918 influenza]{.underline} during World War I, [which claimed
**50-100 million lives**]{.underline} (far more than the war itself).
And, though the 2003 SARS outbreak was contained, causing fewer than
1,000 deaths, the disease was on the verge of deeply disrupting several
East Asian economies including China's. **[There are four crucial facts
to understand about]{.underline}** Ebola and the other
**[epidemics]{.underline}**. First, **[most emerging infectious
diseases]{.underline}** are zoonoses, meaning that they **[start in
animal populations]{.underline}**, sometimes **[with a genetic mutation
that enables the jump to humans]{.underline}**. Ebola may have been
transmitted from bats; HIV/AIDS emerged from chimpanzees; SARS most
likely came from civets traded in animal markets in southern China; and
influenza strains such as H1N1 and H7N9 arose from genetic
re-combinations of viruses among wild and farm animals. [**New zoonotic
diseases are inevitable** as humanity pushes into new
ecosystems]{.underline} (such as formerly remote forest regions); [the
food industry creates **more** conditions for genetic recombination; and
climate change scrambles natural habitats **and species
interactions**]{.underline}. Second, [once a new infectious disease
appears, its spread]{.underline} through airlines, ships, megacities,
and trade in animal products [is likely to be extremely
rapid]{.underline}. These epidemic diseases are new markers of
globalization, revealing through their chain of death how vulnerable the
world has become from the pervasive movement of people and goods. Third,
the poor are the first to suffer and the worst affected. The rural poor
live closest to the infected animals that first transmit the disease.
They often hunt and eat bushmeat, leaving them vulnerable to infection.
Poor, often illiterate, individuals are generally unaware of how
infectious diseases \-- especially unfamiliar diseases \-- are
transmitted, making them much more likely to become infected and to
infect others. Moreover, given poor nutrition and lack of access to
basic health services, their weakened immune systems are easily overcome
by infections that better nourished and treated individuals can survive.
And "de-medicalized" conditions \-- with few if any professional health
workers to ensure an appropriate public-health response to an epidemic
(such as isolation of infected individuals, tracing of contacts,
surveillance, and so forth) \-- make initial outbreaks more severe.
Finally, [**the required** medical]{.underline} responses, including
diagnostic tools and effective medications and vaccines, inevitably lag
behind the emerging diseases. In any event, such [tools must be
**continually replenished**. This requires **cutting-edge biotechnology,
immunology, and**]{.underline} ultimately [**bioengineering** to create
**large-scale** industrial responses]{.underline} (**[such as millions
of doses of vaccines or medicines]{.underline}** in the case of large
epidemics). The AIDS crisis, for example, called forth tens of billions
of dollars for research and development \-- [and similarly substantial
commitments by the pharmaceutical industry]{.underline} \-- to produce
lifesaving antiretroviral drugs at global scale. Yet each breakthrough
inevitably leads to the pathogen's mutation, rendering previous
treatments less effective. [There is no ultimate victory, only a
**constant arms race between humanity and disease-causing
agents**]{.underline}.

[America's status as the world's most vital nation is as **dependent on
its prosperity** as it is on its military might]{.underline} and ability
to project power worldwide. [The federal **government's capacity** to
allocate resources to our armed forces, the **private sector's** ability
to develop beneficial products and technologies, and the satisfaction of
the]{.underline} domestic [public are all **closely tied** to the
continued growth of American wealth]{.underline} at home and abroad.
[This has been proven repeatedly during periods where the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has [faced its greatest
**existential threats**: Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were unable to
keep up with the]{.underline} sheer industrial [output of the American
heartland, while the Soviet Empire lost control of its
satellites]{.underline} in great part [due to their desire to benefit
from the Western free market system]{.underline}.¶ Therefore, [the
formulation of a **long-term strategy** that anticipates the potential
disruptions and opportunities of the new global economy is as important
as questions of diplomacy and military strategy]{.underline}. As
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates evaluates
how it will face the rapidly changing and increasingly interconnected
world of the 21st century, it [**must** take into account its **economic
interests** as well as the potential economic costs associated with
achieving its political objectives]{.underline}.¶ Since the beginning of
the Cold War, [America's **unparalleled** ability to influence countries
through nonviolent means has been **critical** to the **preservation of
global stability**]{.underline}. The most relevant example of this in
our history is the Marshall Plan, which leveraged American capital to
provide a devastated post-War Europe with almost 120 billion dollars
(adjusted for inflation) in aid. This aid was critical to preventing the
spread of Soviet influence into Western Europe, and laid the foundation
for an economically strong region stretching from Portugal to Austria
that has been free from inter-state conflict since 1945. [Because of the
pragmatic exercise of economic influence, the]{.underline}
[E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [is now our strongest ally as
well as our largest trading partner]{.underline}.¶ Worldwide, the
liberal economic system that the United States has promoted through
international trade organizations like the WTO has contributed to
unprecedented economic cohesion between states. When countries are tied
together in the mutually beneficial exchange of goods, the opportunity
cost of war goes up significantly, making political leaders much more
likely to de-escalate and rely on nonviolent means to resolve
conflicts.¶ [Our **economy** also plays a **key role** in helping the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[deal with states that
threaten stability]{.underline}**. [The American **ability to impose
sanctions** has been a **formidable tool** for discouraging **nuclear
prolif**eration and punishing violators of international
norms]{.underline}. [When more direct means of coercion are required, a
powerful industrial and technological base **enables** the maintenance
of a well-funded and technologically **advanced
military**]{.underline}.¶ [America's advanced 17 trillion-dollar economy
has allowed it to exert the influence that it does in the world
today]{.underline}. [However, our **economic strength** and the skill of
our workforce, which have always underwritten our international
influence, **should not be taken for granted**]{.underline}. [**Rapid
growth in the developing world** means that **American companies** and
workers must now contend in an **increasingly crowded global
marketplace**]{.underline}. In the new "knowledge economy," educating
America's workers and [ensuring that the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[retains its role as an innovation capital
must take the highest priority]{.underline}**. On the business side,
reforming America's institutions and [removing barriers to expansion and
innovation will encourage the companies of the future to make their
start here]{.underline}.

#### Trump is a unique risk\-\--psychology proves.

**Foster 16**---Professor of international studies and political science
at the Virginia Military Institute \[Dennis, "Would President Trump go
to war to divert attention from problems at home?" The Washington Post,
19 Dec,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/19/yes-trump-might-well-go-to-war-to-divert-attention-from-problems-at-home/?utm_term=.fd514cf55315>,
accessed 28 Feb 2017\]

[If the U.S. economy tanks]{.underline}, should we [expect]{.underline}
Donald [**Trump** to engage in a **diversionary war**]{.underline}?
Since the age of Machiavelli, [analysts]{.underline} have [expected
world leaders to launch international conflicts to deflect popular
attention away from problems at home]{.underline}. [By stirring up
feelings of patriotism, leaders might escape the political costs
o]{.underline}f scandal, unpopularity --- or [a poorly performing
economy]{.underline}. One often-cited example of diversionary war in
modern times is [Argentina's]{.underline} 19[82]{.underline} [invasion
of the Falklands]{.underline}, which several (though not all) [political
scientists attribute to the junta's desire to divert]{.underline} the
people's [attention from a disastrous economy]{.underline}. In a 2014
article, Jonathan Keller and I argued that whether [U.S. presidents
engage in diversionary conflicts depends in part on their psychological
traits]{.underline} --- how they frame the world, process information
and develop plans of action. [Certain traits **predispose** leaders to
more **belligerent** behavior]{.underline}. Do words translate into
foreign policy action? One way to identify these traits is content
analyses of leaders' rhetoric. The more leaders use certain types of
verbal constructs, the more likely they are to possess traits that lead
them to use military force. For one, [conceptually simplistic leaders
view the world in "black and white" terms; they develop unsophisticated
solutions to problems and are largely insensitive to risks]{.underline}.
Similarly, distrustful leaders tend to exaggerate threats and rely on
aggression to deal with threats. [Distrustful leaders typically favor
military action and are confident in their ability to wield it
effectively]{.underline}. [Thus, when faced with]{.underline}
politically damaging problems that are hard to solve --- such as [a
faltering economy]{.underline} --- [leaders who are both distrustful and
simplistic are less likely to put together complex, direct
responses]{.underline}. [Instead, they develop **simplistic but risky
"solutions"** that divert popular attention from the problem,
utilizing]{.underline} the tools with which they are most comfortable
and confident (**[military force]{.underline}**). Based on our analysis
of the rhetoric of previous U.S. presidents, we found that presidents
whose language appeared more simplistic and distrustful, such as Harry
Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and George W. Bush, were more likely to use
force abroad in times of rising inflation and unemployment. By contrast,
John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton, whose rhetoric pegged them as more
complex and trusting, were less likely to do so. What about Donald
Trump? Since Donald Trump's election, many commentators have expressed
concern about how he will react to new challenges and whether he might
make quick recourse to military action. For example, the Guardian's
George Monbiot has argued that political realities will stymie Trump's
agenda, especially his promises regarding the economy. Then, rather than
risk disappointing his base, [Trump might try to rally public opinion to
his side via military action]{.underline}. [I sampled Trump's campaign
rhetoric, **analyzing 71,446 words** **across 24 events**]{.underline}
from January 2015 to December 2016. Using a program for measuring
leadership traits in rhetoric, [I estimated what Trump's words may tell
us about his level of distrust and conceptual complexity]{.underline}.
The graph below shows Trump's level of distrust compared to previous
presidents. [These results are startling]{.underline}. [Nearly 35
percent of Trump's references to outside groups paint them as harmful to
himself, his allies and friends, and causes that are important to
him]{.underline} --- a percentage almost twice the previous high. The
data suggest that Americans have elected [a leader who]{.underline}, if
his campaign rhetoric is any indication, [will be **historically
unparalleled among modern presidents** in his active suspicion of those
unlike himself and his inner circle, and those who disagree with his
goals]{.underline}. As a candidate, Trump also scored second-lowest
among presidents in conceptual complexity. Compared to earlier
presidents, he used more words and phrases that indicate less
willingness to see multiple dimensions or ambiguities in the
decision-making environment. These include words and phrases like
"absolutely," "greatest" and "without a doubt." A possible implication
for military action I took these data on Trump and plugged them into the
statistical model that we developed to predict major uses of force by
the United States from 1953 to 2000. For a president of average distrust
and conceptual complexity, an economic downturn only weakly predicts an
increase in the use of force. But [the **model** would predict that a
president with Trump]{.underline}'s [numbers would respond to **even** a
**minor** economic **downturn** with an increase in the use of
**force**]{.underline}. For example, were the misery index (aggregate
inflation and unemployment) equal to 12 --- about where it stood in
October 2011 --- [the model predicts a president with Trump's
psychological traits would initiate more than one major conflict per
quarter]{.underline}.

#### Economic dominance prevents global nuclear war.

**Henricksen 17** \-\-- Thomas H. Henricksen, emeritus senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution, Post-American World Order, 23 March 2017,
https://www.hoover.org/research/post-american-world-order

[The emergent world, divided]{.underline} between the United States,
China, and Russia, [points to the new global order. Particularly
worrisome are]{.underline} the [warming relations between Beijing and
Moscow]{.underline}, despite Chinese designs on Siberian lands and
resources. Overcoming a centuries-old rivalry, the recent Sino-Russian
rapprochement compounds Washington's difficulties. Separating Russia
from China, as Kissinger and Nixon did, would be a sensible goal for
President Trump. It has always been a wise recourse to divide one's
adversaries. Besides, the United States and Russia have worked together
in the past. During the World War II, they collaborated against the
Third Reich. And during the Cold War, they cooperated in nuclear arms
treaties and wheat deals, while mutually trying to skirt [a
**flashpoint**]{.underline} that [could end in a **nuclear war**.
Washington can work to steer]{.underline} the Kremlin, as it has done
before, [toward acceptable conduct]{.underline} with its neighbors
before Russia can be more than a tactical ally in the great game with
China. In the immediate future, the United States can adopt
international and domestic approaches to cope with Russian and Chinese
territorial expansionism. The [**tensions stoked by the assertive
regimes** in the Kremlin or Tiananmen Square could **spark a political
or military incident** that might **set off a chain reaction leading to
a large-scale war**]{.underline}. Historically, powerful rivalries
nearly always lead to at least skirmishes, if not a full-blown war. The
anomalous Cold War era spared the United States and Soviet Russia [a
direct conflict]{.underline}, largely from concerns [that]{.underline}
one [would trigger a **nuclear exchange destroying**]{.underline} both
states and much of **[the world]{.underline}**. Such a repetition might
reoccur in the unfolding three-cornered geopolitical world[. It seems
safe to acknowledge that an ascendant China and a resurgent Russia
**will persist** in their geo-strategic ambitions.]{.underline} What Is
To Be Done? The first marching order is to dodge any kind of perpetual
war of the sort that George Orwell outlined in "1984," which engulfed
the three super states of Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania, and made
possible the totalitarian Big Brother regime. A long-running Cold
War-type confrontation would almost certainly take another form than the
one that ran from 1945 until the downfall of the Soviet Union. [What
prescriptions can be offered in the face of the **escalating
competition** among the three global powers?]{.underline} First, **[by
staying militarily and economically strong, the United States will have
the resources to deter its peers' hawkish behavior that might otherwise
trigger a major conflict]{.underline}**. Judging by the history of the
Cold War, the coming strategic chess match with Russia and China will
prove tense and demanding---[since all the countries boast nuclear
arms]{.underline} and long-range ballistic missiles. Next, the United
States should widen and sustain willing coalitions of partners,
something at which America excels, and at which China and Russia fail
conspicuously. [There can be **little room for error**]{.underline} [in
fraught crises]{.underline} among nuclear-weaponized and hostile powers.
[Short- and long-term standoffs are likely]{.underline}, as they were
during the Cold War. [Thus, the playbook]{.underline}, in part,
[involves a waiting game in which each power looks to its rivals to
suffer **grievous internal problems** which could **entail a collapse,
as happened to the Soviet Union**]{.underline}. [Some Chinese and
Russian experts]{.underline} predict grave domestic problems for each
other. They also [entertain **similar thoughts about the United
States**]{.underline}, [which they view as terminally
decadent]{.underline} and catastrophically polarized over politics,
ethnicity, and the future direction of the country. [So, the brewing
three-way struggle also involves a **systemic contest**]{.underline},
[which will test the competitors']{.underline}
**[economic]{.underline}** and political **[institutions]{.underline}**.
[At this juncture, the world is entering a **standoff**]{.underline}
[among the three great and several not-so-great powers. **Averting
war**]{.underline}, while defending our interests, [will prove a
challenge, calling for]{.underline} deft policy, political endurance,
and **[economic growth]{.underline}**, [as well as **sufficient military
force to keep at bay aggressive states or prevail over them if ever a
war breaks out.**]{.underline}

[Geopolitical ambitions could reduce economic interdependence even
further]{.underline}.120 [Russia and China have territorial and
quasi-territorial ambitions beyond their recognized borders, and
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
attempted to counter what it sees as **revisionist
behavior**]{.underline} by both countries. [In a **low-growth world**,
it is possible that leaders of either country would choose to prioritize
their **nationalist ambitions** over economic growth]{.underline}. More
generally, [it could be that the expectation of future gains from
interdependence---rather than existing levels of
interdependence---constrains great power bellicosity]{.underline}.121
[If great powers expect that the future benefits of international trade
and investment will wane, then commercial **constraints on revisionist
behavior will lessen**]{.underline}. All else equal, [this increases the
likelihood of **great power conflict** going forward]{.underline}.

#### Global nuclear war.

Oslo; Leader of East Asia Peace program, Uppsala University \[Stein,
"Deterrence, interdependence and Sino--US peace," International Area
Studies Review, 2015, Vol. 18, No. 3, p. 297-311\]

Several [recent works]{.underline} on China and Sino--US relations [have
made]{.underline} substantial [contributions to the current
understanding of how and under what circumstances]{.underline} a
combination of [nuclear deterrence and economic interdependence may
reduce the risk of war between major powers]{.underline}. At least four
conclusions can be drawn from the review above: first, those who say
that [interdependence may **both inhibit and drive
conflict**]{.underline} are right. [Interdependence raises the cost of
conflict]{.underline} for all sides [but]{.underline} [asymmetrical or
unbalanced dependencies and **negative trade expectations**]{.underline}
may [generate tensions leading to trade wars among inter-dependent
states that]{.underline} in turn [increase the **risk of military
conflict**]{.underline} (Copeland, 2015: 1, 14, 437; Roach, 2014). The
risk may increase if one of the interdependent countries is governed by
an inward-looking socio-economic coalition (Solingen, 2015); second, the
risk of war between China and the US should not just be analysed
bilaterally but include their allies and partners. Third party countries
could drag China or the US into confrontation; third, in this context:
it is of some comfort that the three main economic powers in Northeast
Asia (China, Japan and South Korea) are all deeply integrated
economically through production networks within a global system of trade
and finance (Ravenhill, 2014; Yoshimatsu, 2014: 576); and fourth,
[decisions for war]{.underline} and peace [are taken by very few people,
who act on the basis of their **future expectations**]{.underline}.
International relations theory must be supplemented by foreign policy
analysis in order to assess the value attributed by national
decision-makers to economic development and their assessments of risks
and opportunities. [If leaders]{.underline} on either side of the
Atlantic [begin to seriously **fear or anticipate their own nation's
decline**]{.underline} then [they may blame]{.underline} this on
[external dependence, appeal to anti-foreign sentiments, contemplate the
use of force to gain]{.underline} respect or [credibility, adopt
protectionist policies, and]{.underline} ultimately **[refuse to be
deterred by]{.underline}** either [**nuclear arms** or prospects of
socioeconomic calamities. Such a dangerous shift could happen
**abruptly**]{.underline}, i.e. under the instigation of actions by a
third party -- or against a third party. Yet as long as there is both
nuclear deterrence and interdependence, the tensions [in East
Asia]{.underline} are unlikely to escalate to war. As Chan (2013) says,
all states in the region are aware that they cannot count on support
from either China or the US if they make provocative moves. [The
greatest risk is **not**]{.underline} that **[a territorial
dispute]{.underline}** leads to war under present circumstances [but
that **changes in the world economy** alter those circumstances in ways
that render inter-state peace more precarious]{.underline}. If China and
the US fail to rebalance their financial and trading relations (Roach,
2014) then a trade war could result, interrupting transnational
production networks, provoking social distress, and exacerbating
nationalist emotions. [This could have unforeseen consequences in the
field of security, with nuclear deterrence remaining the only factor to
**protect the world from Armageddon**, and **unreliably
so**]{.underline}. [Deterrence could **lose its
credibility**]{.underline}: one of the two [great powers might gamble
that the other yield in a cyber-war or conventional]{.underline} limited
[war]{.underline}, or third party countries might engage in conflict
with each other, with a view to obliging Washington or Beijing to
intervene.

### Impact\-\--Economy\-\--AT: Resiliency\-\--2NC

#### Decline goes [global]{.underline} -- no resiliency

**Irwin 16** -- Neil Irwin, Senior Economic Correspondent at The New
York Times, MBA from Columbia, formerly a Washington Post Columnist and
the Economics Editor of Wonkblog, "Foreign Crises Test America\'s
Resilience", International New York Times, 1-6, Lexis

Seven days in, 2016 is shaping up to be a chaotic year in global
economics and geopolitics, with profound challenges nearly everywhere.
Except, for now at least, in the world\'s largest economy. [The American
economy is acting as a **steadying force** in a volatile
world]{.underline}. [A giant question for]{.underline} 2016 - not just
for Americans but for [people across the globe who benefit from having
one of the world\'s major economic engines revving while **others
sputter** - is how resilient the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [will prove to be]{.underline}. On one hand,
[in an **interconnected global economy**, troubles in one place can
**spread easily**]{.underline}, whether [through financial
markets]{.underline}, the [banking]{.underline} system [or trade
linkages]{.underline}. Just Thursday the World Bank downgraded its
forecast of 2016 global growth, which implies less demand for American
products around the world - and fewer jobs for American workers. On the
other hand, in the past, the United States has shown an uncanny tendency
to benefit economically from tumult abroad. \'\'The United States may
not have incredibly robust economic growth and has plenty of problems
you can point to,\'\' said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group,
a geopolitical consultancy. \'\'But from a stability perspective, when
things are more unstable, the United States in some ways gets
stronger,\'\' as both people and investment dollars gravitate to the
nation\'s relative stability. The truth is, not one of the problems that
have flared across financial news tickers so far in 2016 is completely
new or surprising. Rather, they are continuations of trends that were
well established in 2015. And as disturbing as it may be to see tensions
rise, conflict in the Middle East is not exactly new. Usually the way
those tensions ripple through the global economy is by driving the cost
of oil up; instead, the opposite is happening. Oil prices fell to \$37 a
barrel from around \$53 a barrel over the course of last year and are
now under \$34. The Shanghai composite index fell sharply, starting in
June of last year, and even after steep declines in the opening days of
2016 is above its late-August level (though it is anybody\'s guess how
much it would have fallen, absent a string of government interventions
to try to stanch the declines). [Economic growth has been slowing not
just in China but across many emerging markets]{.underline}, including
Brazil and Nigeria, for two years now. [Europe and Japan are growing
only barely]{.underline}, and even formerly hot advanced economies like
Canada are suffering from the commodity glut. Against that gloomy
backdrop, the consensus economic forecasts for the United States - the
International Monetary Fund forecasts 2.8 percent growth in 2016 - look
pretty terrific. The American stock market indexes, despite the global
sell-off and major hits to oil companies\' earnings, [remain
above]{.underline} their September levels. But there are two basic
questions about the notion that [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [can serve as an **island of economic and
political stability**]{.underline} [in a messy world]{.underline}.
First, what happens if that changes? Second, what happens if it
doesn\'t? The \'\'things change\'\' situation is the risk that these
global headwinds become too powerful for the United States to overcome.
Already, oil producers and their suppliers are suffering. The American
industrial sector is groaning under the weight of a strong dollar, which
drives up the price of exported goods. That\'s a consequence of the
mismatch between growth in the United States and the rest of the world.
[The strength in the]{.underline} service sector and the [broader
consumer economy in the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[has offset any damage so far. But]{.underline} the 2008 crisis showed
how [the global economy is intertwined]{.underline} in ways that are
hard to predict - and that\'s before accounting for the geopolitical
dangers from the Middle East and the Korean Peninsula that could cause
major economic disruptions if they take a dark turn. [If something does
go wrong, the **usual buffers** in the global economy look to be
**weakened or nonexistent** right now. Government deficits are high in
much of the world, and even where they aren\'t, political leaders have
shown no desire to open the spending floodgates in an effort to bolster
economies.]{.underline}

[Certainty. An early vote for USMCA will provide U.S. businesses from
**every sector**]{.underline}---[from **agriculture** to
**manufacturing** and **services**]{.underline}---[**the certainty**
that their exports to Canada and Mexico will enter those markets
duty-free. This **certainty is invaluable** because **these** two
**markets** are **invaluable to American business.**]{.underline} [U.S.

and Powered growth in U.S. services exports from \$27 billion in 1993 to

for the long haul.]{.underline} Growth. USMCA isn't just about holding
on to what you've got. [USMCA will **boost economic growth** by
**improving the market access** guaranteed for U.S.
businesses.]{.underline} For example, the agreement further opens the
Canadian market to U.S. agricultural exports such as dairy products,
poultry, and wine. [U.S. farmers and ranchers have faced five years of
declining commodity prices,]{.underline} [so USMCA's improved market
access is more than welcome]{.underline}. And [make no mistake: **These
are growth markets**]{.underline}. [U.S. exports]{.underline} to Mexico
and Canada [have grown more over the past decade than sales to any other
country]{.underline}. In each case, exports have expanded by more than
\$100 billion annually. **[No other market comes close]{.underline}**.
In fact, Mexico and Canada accounted for about 40% of the growth in U.S.
goods exports in dollar terms over the past decade. In particular, USMCA
promises growth for America's small and midsized exporters. Canada and
Mexico are the top two export destinations for U.S. small and
medium-size enterprises, more than 120,000 of which sell their goods and
services in our two North American neighbors. [When an American small
business starts exporting, it's almost always to Canada or
Mexico.]{.underline}

#### Key to the economy\-\--digital trade.

Today, nearly six out of 10 American jobs created by exports of digital
services are jobs outside the tech industry. Sectors like agriculture,
health care, and manufacturing make up a large part of the 5 million
total jobs and \$1.35 trillion in annual productivity of the digital
economy, according to the Internet Association. As a result, it [is now
more important than ever to ensure the **rules of the road** on the
**digital highway** are modernized and clear.]{.underline} [That's
why]{.underline} [President
[Trump]{.underline}](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump) and U.S.
Trade Ambassador [Robert
Lighthizer](https://thehill.com/people/robert-bob-lighthizer) [spent
countless hours negotiating the creation]{.underline} of a new "digital
chapter" in [the]{.underline} updated proposed trade agreement with
Mexico and Canada -- the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement
([USMCA]{.underline}). [The USMCA includes a host of new benefits
for]{.underline} American workers, families, and [the
economy.]{.underline} And [the changes impacting the **digital economy**
are among the most important.]{.underline} [It will, for the **first
time**, prohibit the imposition of customs duties]{.underline}, fees, or
other charges on [**digital products** traded
electronically]{.underline}. [It will also safeguard **cross-border data
flows**]{.underline}. [USMCA is the first trade agreement to ensure the
**free flow of data for all sectors**.]{.underline} Businesses of all
sizes, across [all sectors]{.underline}, [**will benefit**
from]{.underline} the free and [safe flow of information. The trade pact
**prohibits data localization** requirements]{.underline} that force
businesses to use or locate computing facilities in a specific country
or territory as a condition for conducting business. Additionally,
[USMCA streamlines customs processes to **support
e-commerce**]{.underline}. As the digital economy continues to evolve
and grow, modernizing the mechanics of how goods flow between countries
in North America is critical. [The new agreement will help **speed the
growth** of **e-commerce.**]{.underline} Finally, [as this sector
continues to evolve and expand, enhanced data protection becomes even
more important.]{.underline} The proposed agreement encourages, for the
first time, data privacy and cybersecurity collaboration. USMCA requires
all three countries to adopt measures to comply with each other's data
privacy laws. USMCA also promotes a collaborative, risk-based approach
and adoption of industry best practices to keep networks and services
secure. These new digital provisions and protections are both timely and
important. A lot has changed in the 25 years since NAFTA was signed into
law. Back then, folks didn't have cell phones, internet access required
a dial-up connection, and movies had to be rented in VHS format. Today,
we live in an interconnected world driven by rapidly evolving digital
technologies and capabilities. We do our work on lightning-fast
computers, interact through mobile phones, and buy goods with a single
click. [These changes have benefited workers and consumers across every
sector.]{.underline} It has created [**countless jobs** and **grown
wages**]{.underline}, all while improving Americans' day-to-day lives.
It has made it easier for farmers to find customers, [leading to
**increased revenue** and **production**]{.underline}. It has overhauled
logistics entirely, empowering manufacturers across the country to be
able to expand and grow, and it is even forcing health care providers to
adapt to new standards. Imagine the potential if [we can make our
digital economy even more competitive on a global scale]{.underline} --
making our products more affordable while simultaneously [expanding
markets for our local job creators.]{.underline} **[That is what USMCA
sets out to achieve]{.underline}**. And that's why the agreement's new
digital provisions are so important. Yet, unfortunately, USMCA is
currently being held hostage by the partisan political circus in
Washington. Delaying approval of the trade pact hits the pocketbooks of
the workers and families in North Carolina and across the nation. Folks
across all sectors -- from farmers and factory floor workers to
programmers and engineers -- are losing out. Far too much hangs in the
balance. USMCA will lead to more jobs, larger paychecks, and cheaper
prices for American consumers. It provides a much-needed foundation for
the expansion of free and fair digital trade and investment in
innovative products and services. And it creates a framework for a
cutting edge, 21st-century economy. It's time for Washington to buck up
and get this agreement over the finish line. We have before us [a once
in a generation opportunity to define a **new global standard** in
**digital trade**]{.underline}, one that [positions the United States as
the **world leader** in the **digital economy**.]{.underline} We can't
afford to let it slip away.

civilization,"

Many [great civilisations have fallen]{.underline}, leaving nothing but
cracked ruins and scattered genetics. Usually this results [from:
**natural disasters, resource depletion, economic meltdown, disease,
poor information flow and corruption**]{.underline}. But we're luckier
than our predecessors because [we command a technology that no one else
possessed: a rapid communication network that finds its highest
expression in the internet]{.underline}. I propose that there are six
ways in which [the net has vastly reduced the **threat of societal
collapse**. Epidemics can be deflected by telepresence]{.underline} One
of our more dire prospects for collapse is an infectious-disease
epidemic. Viral and bacterial epidemics precipitated the fall of the
Golden Age of Athens, the Roman Empire and most of the empires of the
Native Americans. The internet can be our key to survival because the
ability to work telepresently can inhibit microbial transmission by
reducing human-to-human contact. In the face of an otherwise devastating
epidemic, businesses can keep supply chains running with the maximum
number of employees working from home. This can reduce host density
below the tipping point required for an epidemic. If we are well
prepared when an epidemic arrives, we can fluidly shift into a
self-quarantined society in which microbes fail due to host scarcity.
Whatever the social ills of isolation, they are worse for the microbes
than for us. The internet will predict natural disasters We are
witnessing the downfall of slow central control in the media: news
stories are increasingly becoming user-generated nets of
up-to-the-minute information. During the recent California wildfires,
locals went to the TV stations to learn whether their neighbourhoods
were in danger. But the news stations appeared most concerned with the
fate of celebrity mansions, so Californians changed their tack: they
uploaded geotagged mobile-phone pictures, updated Facebook statuses and
tweeted. The balance tipped: the internet carried news about the fire
more quickly and accurately than any news station could. In this
grass-roots, decentralised scheme, there were embedded reporters on
every block, and the news shockwave kept ahead of the fire. This head
start could provide the extra hours that save us. If the Pompeiians had
had the internet in 79AD, they could have easily marched 10km to safety,
well ahead of the pyroclastic flow from Mount Vesuvius. If the Indian
Ocean had the Pacific's networked tsunami-warning system, South-East
Asia would look quite different today. Discoveries are retained and
shared Historically, critical information has required constant
rediscovery. Collections of learning \-- from the library at Alexandria
to the entire Minoan civilisation \-- have fallen to the bonfires of
invaders or the wrecking ball of natural disaster. Knowledge is hard won
but easily lost. And information that survives often does not spread.
Consider smallpox inoculation: this was under way in India, China and
Africa centuries before it made its way to Europe. By the time the idea
reached North America, native civilisations who needed it had already
collapsed. The net solved the problem. New discoveries catch on
immediately; information spreads widely. In this way, societies can
optimally ratchet up, using the latest bricks of knowledge in their
fortification against risk. [Tyranny is mitigated]{.underline}
[Censorship of ideas]{.underline} was a familiar spectre in the last
century, with state-approved news outlets ruling the press, airwaves and
copying machines [in the USSR]{.underline}, Romania, Cuba, China, Iraq
[and elsewhere]{.underline}. In many cases, such as Lysenko's
agricultural despotism in the USSR, it [directly contributed to the
**collapse** of the nation]{.underline}. Historically[, a more
successful strategy has been to confront free speech with free speech
\-- and the internet allows this in a natural way.]{.underline} It
democratises the flow of information by offering access to the
newspapers of the world, the photographers of every nation, the bloggers
of every political stripe. Some posts are full of doctoring and
dishonesty whereas others strive for independence and impartiality \--
but all are available to us to sift through. Given the attempts by some
governments to build firewalls, it's clear that this benefit of the net
requires constant vigilance. [Human capital is vastly
increased]{.underline} [Crowdsourcing brings people together to solve
problems.]{.underline} Yet far fewer than one per cent of the world's
population is involved. We need expand human capital. Most of the world
not have access to the education afforded a small minority. For every
Albert Einstein, Yo-Yo Ma or Barack Obama who has educational
opportunities, uncountable others do not. This squandering of talent
translates into reduced economic output and a smaller pool of problem
solvers. [The net opens the gates education to anyone with a
computer]{.underline}. A motivated teen anywhere on the planet can walk
through the world's knowledge \-- from the webs of Wikipedia to the
curriculum of MIT's OpenCourseWare**.** [The new human capital will
serve us well when we confront **existential threats we've never
imagined** before. Energy expenditure is reduced]{.underline} Societal
collapse can often be understood in terms of an energy budget: [when
energy spend outweighs energy return, collapse ensues]{.underline}. This
has taken the form of deforestation or soil erosion; [currently, the
worry involves fossil-fuel depletion. The internet addresses the energy
problem with a natural ease]{.underline}. Consider the massive energy
savings inherent in the shift from paper to electrons \-- as seen in the
transition from the post to email. [Ecommerce reduces the need to drive
long distances to purchase products]{.underline}**.** [Delivery trucks
are more eco-friendly]{.underline} than individuals driving around, not
least because of tight packaging and optimisation algorithms for driving
routes. Of course, there are energy costs to the banks of computers that
underpin the internet \-- but these costs are less than the wood, coal
and oil that would be expended for the same quantity of information
flow. [The **tangle of events that triggers societal collapse can be
complex,**]{.underline} and there are several threats the net does not
address. [But vast, networked communication can be an antidote to
several of the most **deadly diseases threatening
civilisation.**]{.underline} The next time your coworker laments
internet addiction, the banality of tweeting or the decline of
face-to-face conversation, you may want to suggest that the net may just
be the technology that saves us.

[This instability provides insights into the constantly shifting
structures and recurring wars that occurred]{.underline} throughout the
nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries.6
**[Wars]{.underline}**, however, **[have greatly subsided in parallel
with the huge increase of trade]{.underline}** (partly coincidental with
the introduction of containerized shipping in the 1960s): [between 1820
and 1959 each pair of countries averaged .00056 wars per year, while
from 1960 to 2000 the average was .00005 wars per year, less than one
tenth as much]{.underline}. We see this pattern quite clearly in Figure
1.7 These changes also follow the advent of nuclear weapons, which
impacted the technology of war. Indeed, [we show how nuclear weapons can
lead to some changes in stability, but does not generate peace on its
own]{.underline}. Indeed, [in order to capture the actual patterns that
have emerged one must add]{.underline} other considerations - such as
[trade considerations - since the base model shows]{.underline} that
networks of **[alliances would not be stable with nuclear weapons but
without trade]{.underline}**.8¶ Thus, the second part of our analysis is
to enrich the base model to include international trade. Indeed, there
has been a rapid increase in global trade since World War II (partly
coincident with the growth of container shipping among other stimuli).
[The empirical relationship between war and trade is an active area of
research, with strong suggestions]{.underline} (e.g., Martin, Mayer, and
Thoenig (2008)) [that network concerns may be important]{.underline}.
So, we introduce a concept of a network of alliances being war and trade
stable, which allows countries to form alliances for either economic or
military considerations. In this richer model, an alliance allows
countries to trade with each other and to coordinate military
activities, and so can be formed for either reason. This restores
existence of networks of alliances that are stable against the addition
or deletion of alliances. [**Trade provides two helpful incentives**:
first it provides economic motivations to maintain **alliances**, and
the resulting denser network of alliances then has a **deterrent
effect**; and second, it can **reduce the incentives of a country to
attack another** since trade will be disrupted. This **reduces the
potential set of conflicts** and, together with the denser networks,
allows for]{.underline} a rich family of [stable networks]{.underline}
that can exhibit structures similar to networks we see currently.¶ We
provide some results on the existence and structure of war and trade
stable networks of alliances, showing that structures similar to those
observed over the past few decades are economically stable under
apparently reasonable parameters. It is important to note that another
dramatic change during the post-war period was the introduction of
nuclear weapons, which changes the technology of war and is generally
thought to have greatly increased the defensive advantage to those with
such weapons.9 Our model suggests that although world-wide adoption of
nuclear weapons could stabilize things in the absence of trade, it would
result in an empty network of alliances as the stable network. To
explain the much denser and more stable networks in the modern age along
with the paucity of war in a world where nuclear weapons are limited to
a small percentage of countries, our model points to the enormous growth
in trade as a big part of the answer. [We close the paper
with]{.underline} some [discussion of this]{.underline} potential [role
that]{.underline} the [**growth in trade has played in reducing wars
over the past half century**, and how this relates to the advent of the
nuclear age]{.underline}.¶ Before proceeding, let us say a few words
about how [this paper contributes to the study of war.]{.underline} The
literature on war provides many rationales for why wars occur. Our
analysis here fits firmly into what has become a "rationalist" tradition
based on cost and benefit analyses by rational actors, with roots seen
in writings such as Hobbes (1651) Leviathan, and has become the
foundation for much of the recent international relations literature.10¶
To our knowledge, **[there are no previous models of conflict that
game-theoretically model networks of alliances between
multiple]{.underline}** agents/**[countries based on costs and benefits
of wars]{.underline}**. 11 There are previous models of coalitions in
conflict settings (e.g., see Bloch (2012) for a survey). Here, network
structures add several things to the picture. Our model is very much in
a similar rationalist perspective of the literature that examines group
conflict (e.g., Esteban and Ray (1999, 2001); Esteban and Sakovicz
(2003)), but enriching it to admit network structures of alliances and
of international trade. [This allows us to admit patterns that are
consistent with the networks of alliances that are actually
observed]{.underline}, which are far from being partitions (e.g., the
U.S. is currently allied with both Israel and Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and
India, just to mention a couple of many prominent examples). More
importantly, our Theorem 3 provides a first model in which such
non-partitional such structures are stable and provide insight into
peace. Moreover, as we already mentioned above, [the observed patterns
of wars and of alliances are not partitional, and so this provides an
important advance in moving the models towards matching observed
patterns of wars, trade and alliances.]{.underline}¶ [Our model thus
serves as a foundation]{.underline} upon [which one can eventually build
more elaborate analyses of multilateral interstate alliances, trade, and
wars]{.underline}. It is also important to emphasize that [the network
of international trade is complex and can in fact be stable (and prevent
conflict) precisely because it cuts across coalitions]{.underline}. This
is in contrast to coalitional models that generally predict only the
grand coalition can be stable or that very exact balances are possible
(e.g., see Bloch, Sanchez-Pages, and Soubeyran (2006)). Again, this is
something illustrated in our Theorem 3, and which does not exist in the
previous literature. Finally, [**our model illuminates the relationships
between international trade, stable network structures, and peace**,
something not appearing in the previous literature]{.underline} - as the
previous literature that involves international trade and conflict
generally revolves around bilateral reasoning or focuses on instability
and armament (e.g., Garfinkel, Skaperdas, and Syropoulos (2014)) and
does not address the questions that we address here.¶ [The complex
relationship between trade and conflict]{.underline} is the subject of a
growing empirical literature (e.g., Barbieri (1996); Mansfield and
Bronson (1997); Martin, Mayer, and Thoenig (2008); Glick and Taylor
(2010); Hegre, Oneal, and Russett (2010)). The [literature not only has
to face challenges of endogeneity and causation, but also of substantial
heterogeneity in relationships, as well as geography, and the level of
conflict. The various correlations between conflict and trade are
complex and quite difficult to interpret, **and a model such as ours
that combines military and economic incentives**]{.underline}, and
others that may follow, **[can provide some structure with which to
interpret]{.underline}** some of the **[empirical
observations]{.underline}**, as we discuss in the concluding remarks.

#### Protectionism causes nuclear war.

**Panzner 8** (Michael Panzner, Faculty, New York Institute of Finance,
MA Columbia, "Financial Armageddon", p. 137-138)

Continuing calls for [curbs on]{.underline} the flow of finance and
[trade will inspire]{.underline} the United States and other nations to
spew forth protectionist legislation like the notorious
[Smoot-Hawley]{.underline} bill. Introduced at the start of the Great
Depression, it [triggered a series of]{.underline}
**[tit]{.underline}-[for-tat]{.underline}** economic
**[responses]{.underline}**, [which many commentators believe helped
turn a serious economic downturn into a **prolonged** and **devastating
global disaster**]{.underline}. But if history is any guide, those
lessons will have been long forgotten during the next collapse.
Eventually, fed by a mood of desperation and growing public anger,
restrictions on trade, finance, investment, and immigration will almost
certainly intensify. Authorities and ordinary citizens will likely
scrutinize the cross-border movement of Americans and outsiders alike,
and lawmakers may even call for a general crackdown on nonessential
travel. Meanwhile, many nations will make transporting or sending funds
to other countries exceedingly difficult. As desperate officials try to
limit the fallout from decades of ill-conceived, corrupt, and reckless
policies, they will introduce controls on foreign exchange. Foreign
individuals and companies seeking to acquire certain American
infrastructure assets, or tryiTradeng to buy property and other assets
on the cheap thanks to a rapidly depreciating dollar, will be stymied by
limits on investment by noncitizens. Those efforts will cause spasms to
ripple across economies and markets, disrupting global payment,
settlement, and clearing mechanisms. All of this will, of course,
continue to undermine business confidence and consumer spending. In a
world of lockouts and lockdowns, any link that transmits systemic
financial pressures across markets through arbitrage or portfolio-based
risk management, or that allows diseases to be easily spread from one
country to the next by tourists and wildlife, or that otherwise
facilitates unwelcome exchanges of any kind will be viewed with
suspicion and dealt with accordingly. The rise in isolationism and
[protectionism will bring about]{.underline} ever more heated arguments
and [dangerous]{.underline} [confrontations]{.underline} over shared
sources of oil, gas, and other key commodities as well as factors of
production that must, out of necessity, be acquired from
less-than-friendly nations. Whether involving raw materials used in
strategic industries or basic necessities such as food, water, and
energy, efforts to secure adequate supplies will take increasing
precedence in a world where demand seems constantly out of kilter with
supply. Disputes over the misuse, overuse, and pollution of the
environment and natural resources will become more commonplace. Around
the world, [such **tensions will give rise to full scale military
encounters**]{.underline}**,** often **[with minimal
provocation]{.underline}**. In some instances, economic conditions will
serve as a convenient pretext for conflicts that stem from cultural and
religious differences. Alternatively, nations may look to divert
attention away from domestic problems by channeling frustration and
populist sentiment toward other countries and cultures. Enabled by cheap
technology and the waning threat of American retribution, terrorist
groups will likely boost the frequency and scale of their horrifying
attacks, bringing the threat of random violence to a whole new level.
[Turbulent conditions]{.underline} will [encourage]{.underline}
**[aggressive saber rattling]{.underline}** and interdictions by rogue
nations running amok. [Age-old clashes will also take on a new, more
heated sense of urgency. **China** will likely assume an **increasingly
belligerent** posture toward **Taiwan**, while **Iran** may embark on
**overt colonization** of its neighbors in the Mideast.]{.underline}
Israel, for its part, may look to draw a dwindling list of allies from
around the world into a growing number of conflicts. Some observers,
like John Mearsheimer, a political scientist at the University of
Chicago, have even speculated that an "intense confrontation" between
the United States and China is "inevitable" at some point. More than a
few disputes will turn out to be almost wholly ideological. Growing
cultural and religious differences will be transformed from wars of
words to battles soaked in blood. Long-simmering **[resentments
could]{.underline}** also **[degenerate quickly, spurring]{.underline}**
the basest of human instincts and triggering genocidal acts. [Terrorists
employing]{.underline} **[biological or nuclear weapons]{.underline}**
[will vie with conventional forces using jets, cruise missiles, and
bunker-busting bombs to cause widespread destruction]{.underline}. Many
will interpret stepped-up confl icts between

Loughlin et al. 2012; Scheffran et al. 2012 ). Building on insights from
these studies, as well as other suggestive accounts (e.g. Brinkman and
Hendrix 2011 ;Hendrix and Brinkman 2013 ; Messer and Cohen 2006 ;Prunier
2008 ), the present study demonstrates **[empirically]{.underline}**,
**[for the first time]{.underline}**, **[the existence of a systemic
relationship between conflict]{.underline}** on the one hand,
**[and]{.underline}** **[food (in) security]{.underline}** on the other,
both **[globally and locally]{.underline}**. Specifically, highly
disaggregated cropland-based measures of [food insecurity]{.underline}
are shown to [produce a **significant effect** on the incidence of inter
and intra-state armed conflict **worldwide**]{.underline}.
[Unlike]{.underline} the majority of **[previous studies]{.underline}**,
which rely primarily on country-level indicators (Miguel et al. 2004 ;
Burke et al. 2009 ; Scheffran et al. 2012 ;Buhaug 2010 ) or focus
specifically on sub-Saharan Africa (Miguel et al. 2004 ; Burke et al.
2009;O ' Loughlin et al. 2012;Buhaug 2010; Fjelde and Hultman 2014 ),
the present approach uses geographic factors to estimate the regional
sub-state distribution of conflict globally. Two agricultural output
measures, the percent of cropland in a given region and the amount of
cropland per capita within agricultural regions, are used to proxy for
the demand and supply aspects of food security, respectively (Barrett
2010 ). Using logistic regression (i.e., logit) models, [these measures
are]{.underline} then [paired with a large number of political,
economic, and **climatic** indicators]{.underline} in order [to estimate
the]{.underline} **[direct effects of food security on violent
conflict]{.underline}**. Evidence suggests that [conflict occurs in
areas with higher access to, but lower availability of, food
resources]{.underline}. Together these findings imply that [food
insecurity produces an]{.underline} **[independent effect on
contemporary social and political conflict]{.underline}**. While
relatively little research directly addresses the relationship between
food insecurity and conflict specifically, [numerous
studies]{.underline} have [implie]{.underline}d that such [a
relationship exists]{.underline}. For instance, in their analysis of the
relationship between climate variability and conflict in Sub-Saharan
Africa, Burke et al. found that B \[t\]emperature variables are strongly
related to conflict incidence over our historical panel \^ (2009 ,
20,670. See also Miguel et al. 2004 ; Koubi et al. 2012 ). They further
hypothesize that, B \[t\]emperature can affect agricultural yields both
through increases in crop evapotranspiration (and hence heightened water
stress in the absence of irrigation) and through accelerated crop
development\...reducing African sta- ple crop yields by 10 % -- 30 % per
°C of warming \^ (ibid. 20,672). Somewhat more cautiously, O ' Loughlin
et al. conclude that, B \[o\]ur study and other studies question the
evidence that climatic variability is uniformly driving up the risk of
conflict in sub-Saharan Africa, \^ while also noting that B the positive
association between instability and temperature may result from the
harmful effects of high temperatures on food products such as maize \^
(2012, 18,347). [While these conclusions were supported by subsequent
studies]{.underline} (Raleigh and Kniveton 2012; Hendrix and Salehyan
2012 ;Hsiangand Meng 2014 ), [other scholars question the validity of
these findings]{.underline} and show that the incidence of conflict is
primarily related to political and economic conditions (e.g. Buhaug 2010
). **[In common with all these studies,]{.underline}** however, [is the
insight that a]{.underline} **[major mechanism]{.underline}** by [which
climate change increases the likelihood of conflict is
through]{.underline} [its effects on]{.underline} **[food
supplies]{.underline}**.

### Impact\-\--Ag\-\--T/Econ\-\--2NC

#### U.S. ag collapse triggers economic crisis and global conflict.

**Klare 12** (Michael, professor of peace and world security studies at
Hampshire College, August 8, 2012. "Michael T. Klare: The Hunger Wars in
Our Future".
<http://www.guernicamag.com/daily/michael-t-klare-the-hunger-wars-in-our-future/>)

This, however, is just the beginning of the likely consequences: if
history is any guide, [rising food prices]{.underline} of this sort
[will]{.underline} also [lead to **widespread social unrest** and
**violent conflict**]{.underline}. [Because so many nations depend on
grain imports from the U.S. to supplement their own
harvests]{.underline}, and because intense drought and floods are
damaging crops elsewhere as well, [food supplies are expected to shrink
and prices to rise across the planet. Food]{.underline}--affordable
food--[is **essential to human survival**]{.underline} and well-being.
Take that away, and people become anxious, desperate, and angry. In the
United States, food represents only about 13 percent of the average
household budget, a relatively small share, so a boost in food prices in
2013 will probably not prove overly taxing for most middle- and
upper-income families. It could, however, produce considerable hardship
for poor and unemployed Americans with limited resources. "You are
talking about a real bite out of family budgets,"commented Ernie Gross,
an agricultural economist at Omaha's Creighton University. This could
add to the discontent already evident in depressed and high-unemployment
areas, perhaps prompting an intensified backlash against incumbent
politicians and other forms of dissent and unrest. It is in the
international arena, however, that the Great Drought is likely to have
its most devastating effects. Because so [many nations **depend** on
grain imports from **the U.S.** to **supplement** their]{.underline} own
[harvests]{.underline}, and because intense drought and floods are
damaging crops elsewhere as well, food supplies are expected to shrink
and prices to rise across the planet. "[What happens to]{.underline} the
[U.S. supply has **immense impact** around the world]{.underline}," says
Robert Thompson, a food expert at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.
[As]{.underline} the [crops]{.underline} most affected by the drought,
corn and soybeans, [disappear from world markets]{.underline}, he noted,
[the price of all grains]{.underline}, including wheat, [is likely to
**soar**]{.underline}, causing immense hardship to those who already
have trouble affording enough food to feed their families. The Hunger
Games, 2007-2011 What happens next is, of course, impossible to predict,
but if the recent past is any guide, it could turn ugly. In 2007-2008,
when rice, corn, and wheat experienced prices hikes of 100 percent or
more, sharply higher prices--especially for bread--sparked "food riots"
in more than two dozen countries, including Bangladesh, Cameroon, Egypt,
Haiti, Indonesia, Senegal, and Yemen. In Haiti, the rioting became so
violent and public confidence in the government's ability to address the
problem dropped so precipitously that the Haitian Senate voted to oust
the country's prime minister, Jacques-Édouard Alexis. In other
countries, angry protestors clashed with army and police forces, leaving
scores dead. Those price increases of 2007-2008 were largely attributed
to the soaring cost of oil, which made food production more expensive.
(Oil's use is widespread in farming operations, irrigation, food
delivery, and pesticide manufacture.) At the same time, increasing
amounts of cropland worldwide were being diverted from food crops to the
cultivation of plants used in making biofuels. The next price spike in
2010-11 was, however, closely associated with climate change. An intense
drought gripped much of eastern Russia during the summer of 2010,
reducing the wheat harvest in that breadbasket region by one-fifth and
prompting Moscow to ban all wheat exports. Drought also hurt China's
grain harvest, while intense flooding destroyed much of Australia's
wheat crop. Together with other extreme-weather-related effects, these
disasters sent wheat prices soaring by more than 50 percent and the
price of most food staples by 32 percent. Once again, [a surge in food
prices resulted in **widespread social unrest**]{.underline}, this time
concentrated in North Africa and the Middle East. The earliest protests
arose over the cost of staples in Algeria and then Tunisia, where--no
coincidence--the precipitating event was a young food vendor,Mohamed
Bouazizi, setting himself on fire to protest government harassment.
[Anger over rising food]{.underline} and fuel [prices]{.underline}
combined with long-simmering resentments about government repression and
corruption [sparked]{.underline} what became known as [the Arab
Spring]{.underline}. The rising cost of basic staples, especially a loaf
of bread, was also a cause of unrest in Egypt, Jordan, and Sudan. Other
factors, notably anger at entrenched autocratic regimes, may have proved
more powerful in those places, but as the author of Tropic of Chaos,
Christian Parenti, wrote, "The initial trouble was traceable, at least
in part, to the price of that loaf of bread." Until recently, most
scientists were reluctant to blame particular storms or droughts on
global warming. Now, however, a growing number of scientists believe
that such links can be demonstrated in certain cases. As for the current
drought, [analysts are]{.underline} already [warning of **instability in
Africa**]{.underline}, where corn is a major staple, [and]{.underline}
of [increased popular unrest in **China**, where food prices are
expected to rise at a time of growing hardship]{.underline} for that
country's vast pool of low-income, migratory workers and poor peasants.
[Higher food prices]{.underline} in the U.S. and China
[could]{.underline} also [lead to **reduced consumer
spending**]{.underline} on other goods, further [contributing to the
**slowdown in the global economy**]{.underline} and
[producing]{.underline} yet more worldwide [misery, with unpredictable
social consequences]{.underline}.

In a world confronted by global terrorism, turmoil in the Middlke East,
burgeoning nuclear threats and other crises, [it is easy to lose sight
of the long-range challenges. But we do so at our peril]{.underline}.
[One of the most daunting of them is meeting the world's need for
food]{.underline} and energy in this century. [**At stake is not only
preventing starvation and saving the environment, but also world peace
and security**. History tells us that states]{.underline} may [go to war
over access to resources, and that poverty and famine have often bred
fanaticism and terrorism]{.underline}. [Working to feed the world will
**minimize factors** that contribute to global instability and the
proliferation of w]{.underline}eapons of [m]{.underline}ass
[d]{.underline}estruction. With the world population expected to grow
from 6 billion people today to 9 billion by mid-century, [the demand for
affordable food will increase well beyond current international
production levels]{.underline}. People in rapidly developing nations
will have the means greatly to improve their standard of living and
caloric intake. Inevitably, that means eating more meat. This will raise
demand for feed grain at the same time that the growing world population
will need vastly more basic food to eat. Complicating a solution to this
problem is a dynamic that must be better understood in the West:
developing countries often use limited arable land to expand cities to
house their growing populations. [As good land disappears, people
destroy timber resources]{.underline} and even rainforests [as they try
to create more arable land to feed themselves. The long-term
environmental consequences could be **disastrous for the entire
globe**]{.underline}. Productivity revolution To meet the expected
demand for food over the next 50 years, we in the United States will
have to grow roughly three times more food on the land we have. That's a
tall order. My farm in Marion County, Indiana, for example, yields on
average 8.3 to 8.6 tonnes of corn per hectare -- typical for a farm in
central Indiana. To triple our production by 2050, we will have to
produce an annual average of 25 tonnes per hectare. [Can we possibly
boost output]{.underline} that much? Well, [it's been done
before]{.underline}. Advances in the use of fertilizer and water,
improved machinery and better tilling techniques combined to generate a
threefold increase in yields since 1935 -- on our farm back then, my dad
produced 2.8 to 3 tonnes per hectare. [Much US agriculture has seen
similar increases]{.underline}. But of course there is no guarantee that
we can achieve those results again. Given the urgency of expanding food
production to meet world demand, we must invest much more in scientific
research and target that money toward projects that promise to have
significant national and global impact. For the United States, that will
mean a major shift in the way we conduct and fund agricultural science.
Fundamental research will generate the innovations that will be
necessary to feed the world. [The United States can take a **leading
position** in a productivity revolution]{.underline}. And **[our
success]{.underline}** at increasing food production **[may play a
decisive]{.underline}** humanitarian **[role in the survival of billions

renegotiated the deal. Last year, the U.S. exported \$3.2 billion of
corn and corn products to Mexico and Canada, according to the National
Corn Growers Association. "**[The settlement of Nafta is

2.9 percent to \$3.665 a bushel, the biggest intraday gain since Sept.
20. Prices also climbed Monday as rain delayed harvesting in parts of
the U.S. Midwest, while gains for crude oil signaled support for ethanol
demand, Grow said. [Soybean futures also advanced on **optimism that the
Nafta negotiation could herald more U.S. trade deals**]{.underline},

has shunned U.S. shipments amid the trade war and has increased
purchases from Brazil and other countries.

[On the **"new NAFTA**" trade deal just struck...]{.underline} "There
are two major changes for dairy in the new agreement. First, [there's
additional access for U.S.]{.underline} dairy [products into the
Canadian market]{.underline}. **[That's a very good thing for U.S.
producers.]{.underline}** It's important to keep it in context,
remembering we're talking about a couple of additional percentage points
worth of access to the Canadian market, which is about a ninth the size
of the market in the United States. But every little bit helps,
obviously. "The second change is harder to understand fully. It means
Canada will have to give up on their existing 'Class 7' pricing scheme.
Under that scheme, they've been able to make certain products from
Canada competitive that normally wouldn't be. "We'd been exporting a
product called 'ultra-filtered, high-protein milk' --- a product that
hadn't been envisioned when the first trade agreement was struck 30
years ago. Since there were no limitations on that product we were
selling quite a bit of it to Canada for use as a starting point to make
cheeses and other things. The Canadians said, 'Wait a minute, that's
undercutting our existing programs here. So, we need to find a way to
stop those imports from happening.' And they created the pricing scheme
to make them no longer attractive. "I understand they've agreed to
change that program. Until I understand better how it's to be changed I
don't feel confident saying exactly what will happen. "All of this is a
positive for U.S. dairy producers. The question is how big a positive
it'll be." On other commodities... "The other big change that wasn't in
previous agreements is additional access to Canadian poultry markets.
So, we'll be able to export more chicken and eggs. "Beyond that, my
understanding is [the main things we've done is **kept** **existing
agreements** in place]{.underline}. So, [**we won't have to** worry
about **Mexico wanting to reinstate high tariffs** on U.S.
corn.]{.underline} **[That won't be allowed]{.underline}** and we'll go
back to where things were before the past year, or so.

[The world is facing real and complex challenges to reducing global
hunger]{.underline}, [and the United States has a crucial role to play
in overcoming them]{.underline}. The world today has more than 7 billion
people, 800 million of whom do not receive enough food to be healthy,
and the global population is expected to pass 9 billion by 2050. The
areas of the world where populations are growing the fastest are the
same areas where hunger is most prevalent: Africa and Asia. Especially
in sub-Saharan Africa, [food systems are not equipped to feed their
current populations]{.underline}, never mind their rapidly expanding
ones. At the same time populations are expanding, they are also becoming
more urban. In 2030, [two-thirds of the world\'s population will be
urban, compounding the challenge of getting food to those who need
it]{.underline}. Urban populations demand more processed foods and
meats, which are more resource-intensive to produce. These trends will
drastically increase the strain we are putting on our already limited
natural resources. The rapid economic growth of cities is also causing
urban migration, which pulls people from rural areas, reducing the
overall number of investments in rural infrastructure. [It is against
this demographic backdrop that we must assess]{.underline} the future of
[the American agriculture sector]{.underline}. Increasingly, our food
system is shared and global in nature. Currently, about 12% of food
crosses borders because of trade, and that number is growing rapidly,
having doubled since 2006. [Agriculture is a substantial part of the
U.S. economy]{.underline}; totaling over \$115 billion in exports
annually. [As a global leader in agriculture, the U.S. has the potential
to be a **major player** in getting food to those who need
it]{.underline} and sharing its wealth of knowledge and expertise with
farmers in developing countries. [American foreign assistance has a
history of commitments to agricultural development]{.underline}, which
peaked in the 1960s and has subsequently declined. President Barack
[Obama\'s Feed the Future program has re-ignited that work]{.underline};
helping teach farmers new farming practices, giving them loans to afford
new and improved inputs and making investments in rural infrastructure
to improve market access[. Our Food for Peace program provides more than
**1 million metric tons** in food aid]{.underline} annually to those in
need, as well. But some of the most effective work in this area is
simple, straightforward exchange programs between American and African
farmers, in which American farmers help Africans troubleshoot and solve
agricultural problems. There are many ways American farmers and
agricultural experts can export their knowledge to those who need it in
the developing world. The U.S. Agency for International Development\'s
Farmer-to-Farmer program has helped more than 1 million farmers since
its creation in 1985, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has similar
programs run out of its Foreign Agriculture Service. [USAID also funds
innovation labs and collaborative research support programs]{.underline}
that form long-term university partnerships between American land grant
institutions and African university agricultural research centers. Many
agriculturally oriented non-governmental organizations have farmer
exchange programs as well. In addition to reducing global hunger, [these
investments in agricultural development go to the core of the the United
State\'s self-interest. We are the biggest global exporter of
corn]{.underline}, and one of every three acres of U.S. farmland is
planted for export. The global agricultural trade system is a delicate
balance that requires predictability and effective diplomatic
relationships in order to function. These major demographic shifts
throughout the developing world will surely change the balance of global
trade, and building capacity and trust in areas of growth allows the

#### **Disease causes extinction \-\-- transportation circumvents burnout.** 

**Bar-Yam 16** (Yaneer Bar-Yam, physicist and complex systems scientist,
Founding President of the New England Complex Systems Institute,
"Transition to extinction: Pandemics in a connected world," NECSI (July
3, 2016), http://necsi.edu/research/social/pandemics/transition)

Watch as one of the more aggressive---brighter red --- strains rapidly
expands. After a time it goes extinct leaving a black region. Why does
it go extinct? The answer is that it spreads so rapidly that it kills
the hosts around it. Without new hosts to infect it then dies out
itself. That the rapidly spreading pathogens die out has important
implications for evolutionary research which we have talked about
elsewhere \[1--7\]. In the research I want to discuss here, what we were
interested in is the effect of adding long range transportation \[8\].
This includes natural means of dispersal as well as unintentional
dispersal by humans, like adding airplane routes, which is being done by
real world airlines (Figure 2). [When we introduce]{.underline} long
range [transportation]{.underline} into the model, the success of more
[**aggressive strains**]{.underline} changes. They **[can]{.underline}**
use the long range transportation to [find new hosts and **escape local
extinction**.]{.underline} Figure 3 shows that the more transportation
routes introduced into the model, the more higher aggressive pathogens
are able to survive and spread. As we add more long range
transportation, [there is a critical point at which pathogens become so
aggressive that the entire host population dies]{.underline}. The
pathogens die at the same time, but that is not exactly a consolation to
the hosts. [We call this the phase **transition to
extinction**]{.underline} (Figure 4). [With]{.underline} increasing
levels of [global transportation,]{.underline} human **[civilization may
be approaching]{.underline} [such]{.underline} [a critical
threshold]{.underline}**. In the paper we wrote in 2006 about the
dangers of global transportation for pathogen evolution and pandemics
\[8\], we mentioned the risk from Ebola. Ebola is a horrendous disease
that was present only in isolated villages in Africa. It was far away
from the rest of the world only because of that isolation. Since Africa
was developing, it was only a matter of time before it reached
population centers and airports. While the model is about evolution, it
is really about which pathogens will be found in a system that is highly
connected, and Ebola can spread in a highly connected world. The
traditional approach to public health uses historical evidence analyzed
statistically to assess the potential impacts of a disease. As a result,
many were surprised by the spread of Ebola through West Africa in 2014.
As the connectivity of the world increases, past experience is not a
good guide to future events. A key point about the phase transition to
extinction is its suddenness. Even a system that seems stable, can be
destabilized by a few more long-range connections, and connectivity is
continuing to increase. So how close are we to the tipping point? We
don't know but it would be good to find out before it happens. While
Ebola ravaged three countries in West Africa, it only resulted in a
handful of cases outside that region. One possible reason is that many
of the airlines that fly to west Africa stopped or reduced flights
during the epidemic \[9\]. In the absence of a clear connection, public
health authorities who downplayed the dangers of the epidemic spreading
to the West might seem to be vindicated. As with the choice of airlines
to stop flying to west Africa, our analysis didn't take into
consideration how people respond to epidemics. It does tell us what the
outcome will be unless we respond fast enough and well enough to stop
the spread of future diseases, which may not be the same as the ones we
saw in the past. [As the world becomes more connected, the dangers
increase]{.underline}. Are people in western countries safe because of
higher quality health systems? Countries like the U.S. have highly
skewed networks of social interactions with some very highly connected
individuals that can be "superspreaders." The chances of such an
individual becoming infected may be low but events like a mass outbreak
pose a much greater risk if they do happen. [If a sick food service
worker]{.underline} in an airport [infects 100 passengers]{.underline},
or a contagion event happens in mass transportation, [**an** **outbreak
could**]{.underline} very well **[prove unstoppable]{.underline}**.

#### A deadly pandemic with high infectiousness is [possible]{.underline} and [existential]{.underline}.

Biological Risks [Human populations are subject to natural pandemics
where "new" pathogens spread across large areas]{.underline}. [These can
often be **lethal**]{.underline}: the Black Death killed 72--200 million
people in Eurasia (18%--50% of the world's population), with a mortality
rate ranging from 20%--60% in different locations (Benedictow, 2004;
Ziegler, 2013). The Columbian exchange of diseases between the New and
Old world led to a catastrophic population decline in the Americas
(Alfani & Murphy, 2017). The 1918 flu pandemic resulted in 50--100
million deaths (Johnson & Mueller, 2002) (2.7%--5% of the world's
population). Emerging diseases are likely to cause pandemics in the
future, and this may contribute to extinction. [It may
**appear**]{.underline} [unlikely that a pathogen could cause extinction
of its host, since **lack of hosts** would naturally limit the pathogen
population]{.underline}. However, [this does not apply if the pathogen
has a **reservoir in another host species**. A pathogen with a reservoir
species that acts as a **stable carrier state**]{.underline} [for the
pathogen, a high potential for **infecting susceptible
species**]{.underline} (especially critical age groups),
[and]{.underline} **[hyperlethality]{.underline}** (mortality in the
range of 50%--75%) [may cause **repeated outbreaks**]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} **[gradually reduces the fitness of the species until
eventually it succumbs to other random environmental
events]{.underline}** (MacPhee & Greenwood, 2013). [Amphibian
chytridiomycosis may be a good example, where the pathogen has a large
host range but is **lethal to particular species**]{.underline} (Berger
et al., 2016). [On the other hand, Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease
may cause an extinction in an already threatened species because both a
**low density threshold** and **low genetic diversity** among the hosts
makes **all** individuals susceptible]{.underline} (McCallum, 2012). [As
an example, avian influenza H5N1 represents a recognized potential
pandemic that could cause massive damage if a mutation would add the
**ability of easy transmissibility** between humans]{.underline} (at
present human infections are not transmissible). [It also exists within
a large pool of **bird hosts**]{.underline}. Given that past influenza
pandemics have infected between 24%--38% of the population, H5N1 has a
case fatality rate ranging from 1% to 60%, a rough estimate suggest that
a pandemic could kill between 16.8 million and 1.7 billion people
(Cotton-Barratt et al., 2016). A pandemic flu model estimated 21--33
million deaths globally for a modern re-run of the 1918 flu but noted
that it did not represent a worst case scenario (Madhav, 2013). While
unlikely to be an extinction threat on its own, it could clearly weaken
a vulnerable population. [Viruses with longer incubation times, higher
infectiousness, and case fatality rates are known: while a
super-pandemic combining all these properties may be unlikely, it does
not seem biologically **impossible**.]{.underline} In addition,
**[deliberate]{.underline}** [alterations]{.underline} of different
viruses [have successfully increased transmissibility and lethality, or
**reduce**d **treatability**: the **major biological extinction risk**
may be **deliberately engineered pathogens** rather than
natural.]{.underline}

Here only worldwide events are included. A widespread endemic disease
that is stable in terms of how many people become sick from it is not [a
**pandemic**]{.underline}. 260 3.1.4.1 Expected impact Infectious
diseases have been one of the greatest causes of mortality in history.
Unlike many other global challenges pandemics have happened recently, as
we can see where reasonably good data exist. Plotting **[historic
epidemic fatalities]{.underline}** on a log scale reveals that these
tend to follow a power law with a small exponent: many plagues have been
found to follow a power law with exponent 0.26.261 [These kinds of power
laws are **heavy-tailed**]{.underline}262 [to a **significant
degree**.]{.underline}263 In consequence most of the fatalities are
accounted for by the top few events.264 If this law holds for future
pandemics as well,265 then the majority of people who will die from
epidemics will likely die from the single largest pandemic. Most
epidemic fatalities follow a power law, with some extreme events -- such
as the Black Death and Spanish Flu -- being even more deadly.267 There
are other grounds for suspecting that such [a **high impact epidemic**
will have a **greater probability** than]{.underline} usually
[assumed.]{.underline} All the [features of an **extremely devastating
disease**]{.underline} already [exist in nature:]{.underline}
essentially incurable (Ebola268), nearly always **[fatal]{.underline}**
(rabies269), extremely **[infectious]{.underline}** (common cold270),
[and]{.underline} long **[incubation periods]{.underline}** (HIV271).
[If a pathogen were to emerge that]{.underline} somehow
**[combine]{.underline}**d [**these features** (and]{.underline}
influenza has demonstrated **[antigenic shift]{.underline}**, the
ability to combine features from different viruses272), its death toll
would be extreme. Many relevant features of the world have changed
considerably, making past comparisons problematic. The modern world has
better sanitation and medical research, as well as national and
supra-national institutions dedicated to combating diseases. Private
insurers are also interested in modelling pandemic risks.273 Set against
this is the fact that [**modern** transport and dense **human
population** allow infections to spread much]{.underline} more
rapidly274, and [there is the **potential for urban slums** to serve as
breeding grounds]{.underline} for disease.275 Unlike events such as
nuclear wars, pandemics would not damage the world's infrastructure, and
initial survivors would likely be resistant to the infection. And there
would probably be survivors, if only in isolated locations. Hence the
risk of a [**civilisation collapse** would come from the **ripple effect
of the fatalities**]{.underline} and the policy responses. These would
include political and agricultural disruption as well as economic
dislocation and damage to the world's trade network (including the food
trade). [**Extinction risk** is]{.underline} only [possible if the
aftermath]{.underline} of the epidemic fragments and diminishes human
society to the extent that recovery becomes impossible277 before
humanity succumbs to other risks (such as climate change or further
pandemics).

[witnessed]{.underline} **[a 96% decrease in deaths]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[a 62% increase in life expectancy]{.underline}**.
[By]{.underline} the year [2040]{.underline}, [average U.S. life
expectancy is]{.underline} [anticipated at being 85 years of
age]{.underline}, while the rest of the world is estimated to be at 72
years of age. According to Frank Lichtenberg, Ph.D., [new therapies are
the **greatest contributor**]{.underline} [to increased]{.underline}
life [expectancy]{.underline}. A business professor at Columbia
University, Lichtenberg assessed the contribution of pharmaceutical R&D
to longevity and the economic growth which results. You may find some of
his insights startling. First, [the]{.underline}
[pharmaceutical]{.underline} industry [is the **most R&D-intensive
sector of the economy**]{.underline}, not technology. Second, [the rate
of return]{.underline} on investment in pharmaceutical R&D
[is]{.underline} [18%.]{.underline} Third, [using newer
drugs]{.underline} actually [decreases]{.underline} **[overall
healthcare costs]{.underline}**, [with much of the]{.underline} [savings
being due to **reduced hospital stays**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[physician office visits]{.underline}**. [For \$1 spent]{.underline}
on innovative medicines, [healthcare spending is reduced by]{.underline}
approximately [\$7.20]{.underline}. So let me ask you --- what type of
financial impact does living longer have economically? According to
University of Chicago economists Kevin [Murphy]{.underline}, Ph.D.,
[and]{.underline} Robert [Topel]{.underline}, Ph.D., who [calculated
cumulative gains in life expectancy]{.underline} after 1900 [to be
worth]{.underline} [over]{.underline} **[\$1.2 million]{.underline}** to
the representative American in the year 2000. Further, in the 30 years
between 1970 to the year 2000, life expectancy gains added approximately
\$3.2 trillion per year to the national wealth of the United States. But
[medical innovation contributes **more** than just living
**longer**]{.underline} [and **accumulation of wealth**]{.underline}.
Medical Innovation Economics 101 Over the past 50 years, **[medical
innovation has been the source of more than 50% of all economic
growth]{.underline}** in the United States. It is estimated that [there
are]{.underline} [more than 650,000 jobs in the]{.underline} U.S.
[biopharma]{.underline}ceutical [sector]{.underline}, [with
each]{.underline} of these [jobs supporting]{.underline} an additional
[five]{.underline} jobs [in **other sectors**]{.underline}. In a report
by Battelle, a nonprofit R&D organization, [the overall economic
impact]{.underline} of the biopharmaceutical sector [on the]{.underline}
U.S. [economy]{.underline} in 2009 (as measured by output)
[was]{.underline} estimated to be [more than **\$917
billion**]{.underline} on an annual basis. Further, [the]{.underline}
biopharmaceutical [sector generated]{.underline} nearly **[\$85
billion]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} state, local, and federal tax
[revenues]{.underline} for 2009. [The]{.underline} annual
[average]{.underline} [personal income]{.underline} of a
biopharmaceutical worker in 2009 [was]{.underline} nearly [twice the
average across all private]{.underline} sector [industries]{.underline}
(\$118,690 vs. \$64,278). [When you compare **export**]{.underline}
**[numbers]{.underline}** among industries, you may be surprised to
learn that in 2010 [the]{.underline} U.S. biopharmaceutical [industry
exported \$46.7 billion]{.underline}, which is [more than
automobiles]{.underline} (\$38.4 billion), [plastics and rubber
products]{.underline} (\$25.9 billion), [communications]{.underline}
equipment (\$27 billion), [and computers]{.underline} (\$12.5 billion).
With all of these positive U.S. economic attributes, why then does it
seem everyone is intent on killing the golden goose that medical
innovation represents? The Obama administration is pushing for policy
changes to Medicare Part D, which if enacted will most likely result in
decreased pharmaceutical R&D spending, as well as the loss of possibly
250,000 high wage jobs. So Paul, to answer your question, the
pharmaceutical industry is BIG. How important is medical innovation to
the U.S. economy -- VERY.

Fostering Industries to Counter Global Problems The life sciences have
applications in areas that range far beyond human health.
[Life-science]{.underline} based [approaches]{.underline} could
[contribute to]{.underline} advances in many industries, from energy
production and [**pollution** remediation,]{.underline} to clean
manufacturing and the production of new biologically inspired materials.
In fact, biological systems could provide the basis for new products,
services and industries that we cannot yet imagine. Microbes are already
producing biofuels and could, through further research,
[provide]{.underline} a major component of [future **energy**
supplies]{.underline}. Marine and terrestrial organisms extract carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere, which suggests that biological systems
could be used to help [manage **climate change**]{.underline}. Study of
the complex systems encountered in biology is decade, it is really just

breeding have been just as dramatic as the advances in genetic can put
down a band of fertilizer, come back six months later, and plant seeds
exactly on that row, reducing the need for fertilizer, pesticides, and
other agricultural inputs. Fraley said that the [global

of [doubl]{.underline}ing the current yield of crops [while
reducing]{.underline} key inputs like [pesticides, fertilizers, and

the world." Another billion people will join the middle class over the
next decade just in India and China as [economies continue to

both basic and applied research, The evolution of life "put earth under
new management," Collins said. Understanding the future state of the
planet will require understanding the biological systems that have
shaped the planet. Many of these biological systems are found in the
oceans, which cover 70 percent of the earth's surface and have a crucial
impact on weather, climate, and the composition of the atmosphere. In
the past decade, new tools have become available [to
explore]{.underline} the microbial processes that drive [the chemistry
of the oceans]{.underline}, observed David Kingsbury, Chief Program
Officer for Science at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. These
technologies have revealed that a large proportion of the planet's
genetic diversity resides in the oceans. In addition, many organisms in
the oceans readily exchange genes, creating evolutionary forces that
[can have global effects.]{.underline} [The oceans are currently under
great stress]{.underline}, Kingsbury pointed out. Nutrient runoff from
agriculture is helping to create huge and expanding "dead zones" where
oxygen levels are too low to sustain life. Toxic algal blooms are
occurring with higher frequency in areas where they have not been seen
in the past. Exploitation of ocean resources is [disrupting **ecological
balances**]{.underline} that [have]{.underline} formed over many

In his opening remarks, Dr. Inglesby established the goal of the
conference---to discuss [the **impact** of the life sciences on
**national security**]{.underline}---and outlined recent developments
and challenges in the life sciences. He noted that the Obama
Administration recognized [the unparalleled period of advancements in
life sciences in the National Strategy for **Countering Biological
Threats**]{.underline} (December 2009), which states that [continued
research and development in the life sciences is
**essential**.]{.underline} Importance of the life sciences to national
security. Dr. Inglesby said that for the purposes of this discussion,
[national security is the security, prosperity, and survival of the
country through the use of **military might**, **economic power**,
**diplomacy**, **energy security**, and emergency **preparedness against
terrorism** and **natural catastrophes**. **Life sciences play a key
role in each of these endeavors.** Some of the
breakthroughs]{.underline} of the past year [give a sense of the
fundamental discoveries emerging from the life sciences:

[role of the life sciences in the **American economy** is

competitiveness** in life sciences research and development]{.underline}
and concerns about the increasing time it takes to develop and approve
new medicines, especially in the face of impending cuts to the NIH
budget in FY2011. Key questions. Dr. Inglesby encouraged participants to
consider several key questions, the answers to which, he suggested,
should drive policy and action to clarify the role of the life sciences
in preserving national security: • What is the overall impact of the
life sciences on national security? • What are important trends in the
life sciences and their impact on national security and the economy? •
What are the priorities of U.S. government programs in the life sciences
field? • What should the U.S. do to maintain competitiveness in the life
sciences? • What is the role of the life sciences in diplomatic efforts?
• What can the U.S. do to better realize the many contributions of the
life sciences? The Impact of Life Sciences on National Security When Dr.
Poste opened his talk, he told the audience that he intended to be
provocative, and provocative he was. Dr. Poste conveyed how the [life

security landscape is **changing** because of vulnerabilities posed both
by new life science technologies and by military applications of life
technologies.]{.underline} What is the role of the U.S. in this rapidly
evolving future? Dr. Poste said that while he still believes [the U.S.

Second, if left unchecked, [disease can undermine public confidence in
the state's general custodian function, in the process eroding a
polity's overall governing legitimacy as well as **undermining the
ability of the state itself to function**]{.underline}. [When
large-scale outbreaks occur, such effects can become particularly acute
as the ranks of first responders]{.underline} and medical personnel [are
decimated, making it doubly difficult for an already stressed government
to respond adequately]{.underline}. During the initial weeks of the
anthrax attacks in fall 2001, the lack of coordination at the federal
level, especially with regard to communication, led to a loss of
confidence by some citizens, especially postal workers in Washington,
D.C. Potentially exposed individuals were given conflicting advice on
antibiotic treatment and the efficacy of the anthrax vaccine. The
general public, largely because of inconsistent information enunciated
by government officials, bought Cipro, the antibiotic approved for the
treatment of anthrax, in large numbers. Similarly, in 1996, Japan
suffered a severe food poisoning epidemic caused by Escherichia coli
O157. Over the course of two months, eight people died and thousands of
others were sickened. The perceived inability of the Tokyo government to
enact an appropriate response generated widespread public criticism,
compounding popular dissatisfaction with an administration that was
still reeling from the effects of the previous year's Kobe earthquake.
As one commentator remarked at the height of the crisis, "The cries
against government authorities are growing louder by the day. . . . The
impression here \[in Japan\] is too much talk and not enough action has
led to yet another situation that has spun out of control." 23 Third,
[disease adversely affects the **economic foundation upon**]{.underline}
**[which]{.underline}** both human and state **[security
depends]{.underline}**. [The fiscal burden imposed by]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} HIV/[AIDS epidemic provides a case in
point.]{.underline} Twenty-five million people are currently
HIV-positive in subSaharan Africa, costing already impoverished
governments billions of dollars in direct economic costs and loss of
productivity. Treating HIV-related illnesses in South Africa, the
worst-hit country on the continent, is expected to generate annual
increases in healthcare costs in excess of US\$500 million by 2009 (see
Chapter Three). 2 4 South and Southeast Asia are expected to surpass
Africa in terms of infections by the year 2010. If this in fact occurs,
[**demographic upheaval could**]{.underline} tax and [**widely
destabilize** countries with fragile economies and public health
infrastructures. Economies will be greatly affected by the loss of a
stable and productive workforce as well as from a reduction of external
capital investment, potentially reducing]{.underline} general gross
domestic product ([GDP]{.underline}) by [as much as 20
percent.]{.underline} 25 Fourth, [disease can have a profound, negative
impact on a state's social order, functioning, and psyche]{.underline}.
In Papua New Guinea, for instance, AIDS has severely distorted the wa n
t o k system---which formalizes reciprocal responsibilities, ensuring
that those who hit hard times will be taken care of by extended
family---because of the fear and stigma attached to the disease. 26 The
Ebola outbreak that hit the crowded Ugandan district of Gulu in late
2000 caused people to completely withdraw from contact with the outside
world, reducing common societal interactions and functions to a bare
minimum. 27 Epidemics may also lead to forms of post-traumatic stress. A
number of analyses have been undertaken to assess the long-term
psychological effects on those who have been continually subjected to
poor sanitary conditions and outbreaks of disease. The studies
consistently document the extreme emotional stress suffered by these
people and the difficulty of integrating them back into "normal
society." 28 Fifth, the spread of [infectious diseases can act as a
**catalyst for regional instability**.]{.underline} [Epidemics can
severely undermine defense force capabilities (just as they distort
civilian worker productivity]{.underline}). [By galvanizing mass
cross-border population flows and fostering economic problems, they can
also help create the type of **widespread volatility** that can quickly
translate into heightened tension]{.underline} both within and between
states. This combination of military, demographic, and fiscal effects
has already been created by the AIDS crisis in Africa. Indeed, [the U.S.
State Department increasingly speculates that the disease will emerge as
**one of the most significant "conflict starters"**]{.underline} and
possibly even "war outcome determinants" [during the next
decade.]{.underline}

[In the United States, the law currently includes a 12-year data
protection term for biologics]{.underline}. Pharmaceutical companies
previously lobbied for a data protection term of 14 to 16 years, while
the Obama administration sought a 7-year protection term in an attempt
to reduce drug prices. The 12- year term was ultimately agreed upon to
obtain congressional approval for the Affordable Care Act. Critics of
longer data protection terms, such as the US-based Association for
Accessible Medicine, have voiced concerns that longer protection terms
create "a windfall for brand-name drug manufacturers and raise
prescription drug prices for patients in the United States." On the
other hand, [proponents of longer data protection terms argue that
biologics are among the **most promising medications** but also the
**most costly to produce**]{.underline}; [thus the increased protection
term **incentivizes pharma**ceutical **companies to

For each of these initiatives to be successful, [lawmakers must
recognize that investing in the cures of tomorrow requires continued
bipartisan cooperation]{.underline}. [This rings true for passing
the]{.underline} U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (**[USMCA]{.underline}**),
as well. [The next generation of medical innovation depends on
**significant private sector investments**]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} intellectual property ([IP]{.underline}) [provisions
of USMCA help to lay the foundation for continued investment into
the]{.underline} research and development [(R&D) of innovative
cures]{.underline} across North America. In particular, [the 10-year
term of regulatory data protection for biologics will]{.underline} help
[ensure]{.underline} that [North America]{.underline} [**continues to
lead the world** in **developing life-saving
tech**nologies]{.underline}. For most of the relatively short history of
modern medicine---aspirin was the pioneer in 1899---drugs prescribed to
patients were small-molecule chemical products. For generations,
[innovative pharma]{.underline}ceutical [companies have made
**high-risk**]{.underline}, high-capital [**R&D investments** to
produce]{.underline} [treatments on the basis of patent rights that
provide a limited period of exclusivity to **recoup front-end
investment**]{.underline}. While the U.S., Mexico, and Canada all offer
a 20-year term of patent protection, innovators must file for patent
protection long before a medicine enters the market. So, in practice,
the effective period of market exclusivity is much shorter. Today, [40%
of the U.S. prescription drug market is comprised]{.underline} not
[of]{.underline} small molecule pharmaceuticals but of
[biologics]{.underline}. These are complex (or "large molecule")
medicines derived from living cells. Bio[logic medicines have enabled
the emerging bio-pharmaceutical community to treat
conditions]{.underline}---ranging from infectious diseases to rare
genetic disorders to cancers---for [which there had been no viable
treatment options]{.underline}. [Comprising nearly **70% of today's
innovation pipeline**, biologics are the **medicine of the future**. To
make the most of the vast potential]{.underline} that biologics hold[, a
strong framework of legal rights is needed to make possible the enormous
investment these medical innovations represent]{.underline}. Biologics
are derived from living organisms, an area of considerable ambiguity in
domestic and global patent law. Given the degree of legal uncertainty
surrounding biologics patents, bio-pharmaceutical companies rely on
governments to instead provide a period of exclusivity for the
proprietary information they must submit to prove the safety and
efficacy of a new biologic medicine. The exclusive right to the data
that companies produce at their own expense through R&D and clinical
trials is known as regulatory data protection or RDP. [The USMCA will
guarantee a 10-year minimum term]{.underline} of RDP [for biologics
innovators]{.underline} throughout North America, which stands as a
significant advancement of Canada's and Mexico's current laws. [This
will help ensure that innovators across North America can **continue to
invest in life-saving biologics**.]{.underline} Critics claim that RDP
will increase the cost of medicines, but [research from the Geneva
Network](https://geneva-network.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/RDP_biologics_TPP.pdf)
illustrates that when Canada and Japan extended the term of RDP in the
past, it had no significant impact on pharmaceutical expenditure. In
fact, when Canada introduced an eight-year term of RDP in 2006,
pharmaceutical expenditure as a percentage of total health spending
actually decreased in the years that followed. Others have argued that
RDP will delay the entry of less expensive follow-on medicines. Unlike
small-molecule pharmaceuticals, where the manufacture of a "generic"
version is a relatively straightforward---if complex---process, the
living organism that comprises a biologic medicine cannot be exactly
replicated. Instead, follow-on producers generate a highly comparable
product, known as a biosimilar. Though these drugs are not identical to
the innovator's, biosimilar manufacturers rely on the original
innovator's test data to warrant the safety, purity, and efficacy of
their own treatment, and meanwhile, they bear none of the cost of
producing that data. Given the complexity of and time required to
manufacture biosimilars, studies have shown that a 10-year term of RDP
for the innovative biologic does not delay the introduction of the
biosimilar in the marketplace. Thus, [concerns that RDP will undermine
the availability of cheaper, follow-on products are unfounded. The dual
objectives of continued medical innovation and enhanced public
health]{.underline} across North America [require **effective legal
protections**]{.underline} that guarantee the rights of innovators and
provide a pathway for cheaper generics and biosimilars to follow. The
10-year term of RDP included in [the USMCA will ensure that innovative
companies across the region can invest in the **next generation of
medical technology**]{.underline}, while preserving the pathway for
lower cost follow-ons. [Improving public health by **enabling medical
innovation** should be a]{.underline} bipartisan
**[priority]{.underline}**, and [congressional **approval of the USMCA**
will ensure that North American innovators can continue to **invest in
the cures of tomorrow**.]{.underline}

[When American firms dominate a global market]{.underline} worth more
than \$70 billion a year, [you'd expect to hear about it]{.underline}.
[Not so with the global arms trade]{.underline}. [It's good for **one or
two stories a year** in the **mainstream media**]{.underline}, usually
when the annual statistics on the state of the business come out. [It's
not that no one writes about aspects of the arms trade]{.underline}.
[There are occasional pieces]{.underline} that, for example, take note
of the impact of US weapons transfers, including cluster bombs, to Saudi
Arabia, or of the disastrous dispensation of weaponry to US allies in
Syria, or of foreign sales of the costly, controversial F-35 combat
aircraft. And once in a while, if a foreign leader meets with the
president, US [arms sales]{.underline} to his or her country [might
generate an article or two]{.underline}. [But **the**]{.underline} sheer
size of the American arms trade, the **[politics that drive
it]{.underline}**, the companies that profit from it, and its
devastating global impacts [are **rarely discussed**, much less analyzed
in any depth]{.underline}. So here's a question that's puzzled me for
years (and I'm something of an arms wonk): Why do other major US
exports---from Hollywood movies to Midwestern grain shipments to Boeing
airliners---garner regular coverage while trends in weapons exports
remain in relative obscurity? Are we ashamed of standing essentially
alone as the world's number one arms dealer, or is our Weapons "R" Us
role such a commonplace that we take it for granted, like death or
taxes? The numbers should stagger anyone. According to the latest
figures available from the Congressional Research Service, the United
States was credited with more than half the value of all global arms
transfer agreements in 2014, the most recent year for which full
statistics are available. At 14 percent, the world's second largest
supplier, Russia, lagged far behind. Washington's "leadership" in this
field has never truly been challenged. The US share has fluctuated
between one-third and one-half of the global market for the past two
decades, peaking at an almost monopolistic 70 percent of all weapons
sold in 2011. And the gold rush continues. Vice Admiral Joe Rixey, who
heads the Pentagon's arms sales agency, euphemistically known as the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency, estimates that arms deals
facilitated by the Pentagon topped \$46 billion in 2015, and are on
track to hit \$40 billion in 2016. To be completely accurate, there is
one group of people who pay remarkably close attention to these
trends---executives of the defense contractors that are cashing in on
this growth market. With the Pentagon and related agencies taking in
"only" about \$600 billion a year---high by historical standards but
tens of billions of dollars less than hoped for by the defense
industry---companies like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and General
Dynamics have been looking to global markets as their major source of
new revenue. In a January 2015 investor call, for example, Lockheed
Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson was asked whether the Iran nuclear deal
brokered by the Obama administration and five other powers might reduce
tensions in the Middle East, undermining the company's strategy of
increasing its arms exports to the region. She responded that continuing
"volatility" in both the Middle East and Asia would make them "growth
areas" for the foreseeable future. In other words, no worries. As long
as the world stays at war or on the verge of it, Lockheed Martin's
profits won't suffer---and, of course, its products will help ensure
that any such "volatility" will prove lethal indeed. Under Hewson,
Lockheed has set a goal of getting at least 25 percent of its revenues
from weapons exports, and Boeing has done that company one better. It's
seeking to make overseas arms sales 30 percent of its business. GOOD
NEWS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST (IF YOU'RE AN ARMS MAKER) Arms deals are a way
of life in Washington. From the president on down, significant parts of
the government are intent on ensuring that American arms will flood the
global market and companies like Lockheed and Boeing will live the good
life. From the president on his trips abroad to visit allied world
leaders to the secretaries of state and defense to the staffs of US
embassies, American officials regularly act as salespeople for the arms
firms. And the Pentagon is their enabler. From brokering, facilitating,
and literally banking the money from arms deals to transferring weapons
to favored allies on the taxpayers' dime, it is in essence the world's
largest arms dealer. In a typical sale, the US government is involved
every step of the way. The Pentagon often does assessments of an allied
nation's armed forces in order to tell them what they "need"---and of
course what they always need is billions of dollars in new US-supplied
equipment. Then the Pentagon helps negotiate the terms of the deal,
notifies Congress of its details, and collects the funds from the
foreign buyer, which it then gives to the US supplier in the form of a
defense contract. In most deals, the Pentagon is also the point of
contact for maintenance and spare parts for any US-supplied system. The
bureaucracy that helps make all of this happen, the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency, is funded from a 3.5 percent surcharge on the deals
it negotiates. This gives it all the more incentive to sell, sell, sell.
And the pressure for yet more of the same is always intense, in part
because the weapons makers are careful to spread their production
facilities to as many states and localities as possible. In this way,
they ensure that endless support for government promotion of major arms
sales becomes part and parcel of domestic politics. General Dynamics,
for instance, has managed to keep its tank plants in Ohio and Michigan
running through a combination of add-ons to the Army budget---funds
inserted into that budget by Congress even though the Pentagon didn't
request them---and exports to Saudi Arabia. Boeing is banking on a
proposed deal to sell 40 F-18s to Kuwait to keep its St. Louis
production line open, and is currently jousting with the Obama
administration to get it to move more quickly on the deal. Not
surprisingly, members of Congress and local business leaders in such
states become strong supporters of weapons exports. Though seldom
thought of this way, the US political system is also a global arms
distribution system of the first order. In this context, the Obama
administration has proven itself a good friend to arms exporting firms.
During President Obama's first six years in office, Washington entered
into agreements to sell more than \$190 billion in weaponry
worldwide---more, that is, than any US administration since World War
II. In addition, Team Obama has loosened restrictions on arms exports,
making it possible to send abroad a whole new range of weapons and
weapons components---including Black Hawk and Huey helicopters and
engines for C-17 transport planes---with far less scrutiny than was
previously required. This has been good news for the industry, which had
been pressing for such changes for decades with little success. But the
weaker regulations also make it potentially easier for arms smugglers
and human rights abusers to get their hands on US arms. For example, 36
US allies---from Argentina and Bulgaria to Romania and Turkey---will no
longer need licenses from the State Department to import weapons and
weapons parts from the United States. This will make it far easier for
smuggling networks to set up front companies in such countries and get
US arms and arms components that they can then pass on to third parties
like Iran or China. Already a common practice, it will only increase
under the new regulations. The degree to which the Obama administration
has been willing to bend over backward to help weapons exporters was
underscored at a 2013 hearing on those administration export "reforms."
Tom Kelly, then the deputy assistant secretary of the State Department's
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, caught the spirit of the era when
asked whether the administration was doing enough to promote American
arms exports. He responded: "\[We are\] advocating on behalf of our
companies and doing everything we can to make sure that these sales go
through... and that is something we are doing every day, basically
\[on\] every continent in the world... and we're constantly thinking of
how we can do better." One place where, with a helping hand from the
Obama administration and the Pentagon, the arms industry has been doing
a lot better of late is the Middle East. Washington has brokered deals
for more than \$50 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia alone for
everything from F-15 fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to
combat ships and missile defense systems. The most damaging deals, if
not the most lucrative, have been the sales of bombs and missiles to the
Saudis for their brutal war in Yemen, where thousands of civilians have
been killed and millions of people are going hungry. Members of Congress
like Michigan Representative John Conyers and Connecticut Senator Chris
Murphy have pressed for legislation that would at least stem the flow of
the most deadly of the weaponry being sent for use there, but they have
yet to overcome the considerable clout of the Saudis in Washington (and,
of course, that of the arms industry as well). When it comes to the arms
business, however, there's no end to the good news from the Middle East.
Take the administration's proposed new 10-year aid deal with Israel. If
enacted as currently planned, it would boost US military assistance to
that country by up to 25 percent---to roughly \$4 billion per year. At
the same time, it would phase out a provision that had allowed Israel to
spend one-quarter of Washington's aid developing its own defense
industry. In other words, all that money, the full \$4 billion in
taxpayer dollars, will now flow directly into the coffers of companies
like Lockheed Martin, which is in the midst of completing a
multi-billion-dollar deal to sell the Israelis F-35s. "VOLATILITY" IN
ASIA AND EUROPE As Lockheed Martin's Marillyn Hewson noted, however, the
Middle East is hardly the only growth area for that firm or others like
it. The dispute between China and its neighbors over the control of the
South China Sea (which is in many ways an incipient conflict over
whether that country or the United States will control that part of the
Pacific Ocean) has opened up new vistas when it comes to the sale of
American warships and other military equipment to Washington's East
Asian allies. The recent Hague court decision rejecting Chinese claims
to those waters (and the Chinese rejection of it) is only likely to
increase the pace of arms buying in the region. At the same time, in the
good-news-never-ends department, growing fears of North Korea's nuclear
program have stoked a demand for US-supplied missile defense systems.
The South Koreans have, in fact, just agreed to deploy Lockheed Martin's
THAAD anti-missile system. In addition, the Obama administration's
decision to end the longstanding embargo on US arms sales to Vietnam is
likely to open yet another significant market for US firms. In the past
two years alone, the United States has offered more than \$15 billion
worth of weaponry to allies in East Asia, with Taiwan, Japan, and South
Korea accounting for the bulk of the sales. In addition, the Obama
administration has gone to great lengths to build a defense relationship
with India, a development guaranteed to benefit US arms exporters. Last
year, Washington and New Delhi signed a 10-year defense agreement that
included pledges of future joint work on aircraft engines and aircraft
carrier designs. In these years, the United States has made significant
inroads into the Indian arms market, which had traditionally been
dominated by the Soviet Union and then Russia. Recent deals include a
\$5.8 billion sale of Boeing C-17 transport aircraft and a \$1.4 billion
agreement to provide support services related to a planned purchase of
Apache attack helicopters. And don't forget "volatile" Europe. Great
Britain's recent Brexit vote introduced an uncertainty factor into
American arms exports to that country. The United Kingdom has been by
far the biggest purchaser of US weapons in Europe of late, with more
than \$6 billion in deals struck over the past two years alone---more,
that is, than the United States has sold to all other European countries
combined. The British defense behemoth BAE is Lockheed Martin's
principal foreign partner on the F-35 combat aircraft, which at a
projected cost of \$1.4 trillion over its lifetime already qualifies as
the most expensive weapons program in history. If Brexit-driven
austerity were to lead to a delay in, or the cancellation of, the F-35
deal (or any other major weapons shipments), it would be a blow to
American arms makers. But count on one thing: were there to be even a
hint that this might happen to the F-35, lobbyists for BAE will mobilize
to get the deal privileged status, whatever other budget cuts may be in
the works. On the bright side (if you happen to be a weapons maker), any
British reductions will certainly be more than offset by opportunities
in Eastern and Central Europe, where a new Cold War seems to be gaining
traction. Between 2014 and 2015, according to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute, military spending increased by
13 percent in the region in response to the Russian intervention in
Ukraine. The rise in Poland's outlays, at 22 percent, was particularly
steep. Under the circumstances, it should be obvious that trends in the
global arms trade are a major news story and should be dealt with as
such in the country most responsible for putting more weapons of a more
powerful nature into the hands of those living in "volatile" regions.
It's a monster business (in every sense of the word) and certainly has
far more dangerous consequences than licensing a Hollywood blockbuster
or selling another Boeing airliner. [Historically, there have been
**rare occasions** of public protest against unbridled arms
trafficking]{.underline}, as with the backlash against "the merchants of
death" after World War I, or the controversy over who armed Saddam
Hussein that followed the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Even now, small numbers
of congressional representatives, including John Conyers, Chris Murphy,
and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, continue to try to halt the sale of
cluster munitions, bombs, and missiles to Saudi Arabia. [There is,
however, **unlikely to be a genuine public debate** about the value of
the arms business and Washington's place in it if it isn't even
considered a subject worthy of more than an occasional media
story]{.underline}. In the meantime, the United States continues to hold
onto the number one role in the global arms trade, the White House does
its part, the Pentagon greases the wheels, and the dollars roll in to
profit-hungry US weapons contractors.

[and]{.underline} **[d]{.underline}**evelopment.
**[Rather]{.underline}**, [there are **billions of dollars left over
even after worldwide research budgets are covered**]{.underline}. [To
put the excess revenue in perspective, lowering the magnitude of the US
premium to a level where it matches global R&D expenditures across the
15 companies we assessed would have saved US patients, businesses, and
taxpayers approximately \$40 billion in 2015, a year for which the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reported that total US
spending on pharmaceuticals was [\$325
billion](https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet.html)]{.underline}.
Although we can conclude that premium pricing exceeds what is needed to
fund global R&D, our analysis does not address whether prices in
European countries or in the US are appropriate. We do know that all of
the European countries included in our analysis use pharmacoeconomic
analyses in their price negotiations, while this cannot be said of the
US. Importantly, our analysis cannot inform the question whether or not
it is appropriate for US patients, taxpayers, and businesses to bear the
burden of funding pharmaceutical research for the world.

For most of human history, natural pandemics have posed the greatest
risk of mass global fatalities.37 However, there are some reasons to
believe that [natural pandemics are **very unlikely to cause human
extinction**.]{.underline} Analysis of the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list database has shown that [of the
833 recorded plant and animal species extinctions known to have occurred
since 1500, **less than 4%** (31 species) were ascribed to infectious
disease]{.underline}.38 [None of the mammals and amphibians on this list
were globally dispersed, and other factors aside from infectious disease
also contributed to their extinction.]{.underline} [It]{.underline}
therefore [seems that our own species, which is **very numerous**,
**globally dispersed**, and capable of a **rational response to
problems**, is very unlikely to be killed off by a natural
pandemic.]{.underline} One underlying explanation for this is [that
highly lethal pathogens can kill their hosts before they have a chance
to spread]{.underline}, so [there is a **selective pressure for
pathogens not to be highly lethal**]{.underline}. Therefore, pathogens
are likely to co-evolve with their hosts rather than kill all possible
hosts.39

#### Trump can't cancel old NAFTA -- means no leverage AND no impact. 

Alison **Peck 19**. Professor of Law, West Virginia University College

Social Science Research Network. papers.ssrn.com,
https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3252534.

These questions are inter-related, and this Article endeavors to answer
them all. As Section I describes, [the answer to the first question --
can the President give **notice** of withdrawal under international law?
-- is a simple **yes**]{.underline}. [But]{.underline}
**[functional]{.underline}** [withdrawal and termination of **statutory
commitments**]{.underline} [both depend on the second and third
questions: whether the President has the power to unilaterally
**withdraw**]{.underline} the United States [from]{.underline} NAFTA
under the **[statutes]{.underline}** that outline the
congressional-executive agreement process or, independently, under the
Constitution. Sections II and III take up the statutory and
constitutional analysis, respectively, and conclude that **[he does
not]{.underline}**. That conclusion invites an exploration of remedies.
[The NAFTA Implementation Act appears to be **designed** to
self-destruct upon lawful U.S. withdrawal]{.underline} (Section IV) --
[but termination might not occur if **Presidential withdrawal exceeds
the scope of his** constitutional and **statutory authority**. This
argument may be a more potent way to oppose unilateral Presidential
action than a direct **constitutional** challenge]{.underline}: Section
V concludes that private litigants face significant, though perhaps not
insurmountable, justiciability hurdles in a constitutional challenge.
Congress also has several available mechanisms to challenge unilateral
Presidential withdrawal, but political will to exercise them may falter.
At the outset, let us recall one critical fact that will guide this
analysis: **[NAFTA is not a treaty]{.underline}**. Treaty formation is
expressly governed by the Treaty Clause of Article II of the
Constitution -- Presidential negotiation of an agreement followed by
ratification by a two-thirds majority of the Senate.3 Although the
Constitution's silence on the process for withdrawing from treaties has
caused its own complications,4 at least it may be argued that Article II
provides the starting point for answering those questions.5 But the
Constitution does not expressly contemplate congressional-executive
agreements at all. Congressionalexecutive agreements arose some time
during the twentieth century -- it is not exactly clear when or how.6 In
the trade context, they were memorialized by the Trade Act of 1974,
which created a procedure for entry into international trade agreements
that differed in important respects from treaty formation under Article
II.7 Although federal courts have declined to decide whether
congressional-executive agreements are constitutional,8 the practice has
continued as an exercise between Congress and the President for decades
(at least) and appears now to be an accepted fact of constitutional
life. Scholars have long debated the constitutionality of entering into
congressional-executive agreements,9 but little scholarly attention has
been paid to the constitutionally proper procedure for withdrawing from
them.10 And the **[statutes]{.underline}** [that set up]{.underline} the
process for [congressional-executive agreements]{.underline} contain
detailed instructions for how the President and Congress will exercise
their respective areas of constitutional authority in entering into
those agreements, but precious little instruction about what each branch
may or must do to effect withdrawal or termination. If the statutes
clear about who may effect withdrawal, is the Executive empowered to
fill the gaps? Is there a boundary between Executive authority over
foreign affairs and Legislative authority to regulate foreign commerce
that should be preserved when the United States withdraws from trade
agreements? The President's power to unilaterally withdraw from
congressional-executive agreements has important implications for the
renegotiation of NAFTA as well as other trade agreements in an era of
growing protectionism. [The President's threat of withdrawal has been
used as a **bargaining tool** in NAFTA negotiations]{.underline},11 and
international perception of legality of unilateral Executive action will
bear on the weight of that threat in these and any future trade
agreement renegotiations. [If congressional **approval** is required,
that **threat is less forceful**]{.underline}. The present
Republican-controlled Congress may be torn between following their
party's President and pleasing their Republican constituencies, which
have traditionally supported free trade. The politics of congressional
approval would also be complicated if **[Democrat]{.underline}**s
maintain their 2017 momentum and win the **[House]{.underline}** in
2018,12 since the party has traditionally resisted free trade agreements
but [has **no fondness** for the current President]{.underline}. Serious
scholarly (and legislative) attention to the question of legal authority
to withdraw from congressional-executive agreements is now imperative
and overdue.

War Is Hurting Farmers, But They Still Think He Can Win It,\" 4-11-2019,

Spring is supposed to be a time of optimism in rural communities across
America. It's when farmers sow the seeds of prosperity into neat,
GPS-calibrated rows and when they pray for just the right amount of rain
and sun and for prices to hold up so that when fall approaches, there's
a crop worth harvesting. [This year is different]{.underline}. In
Washington apple orchards, North Carolina hog farms, and soybean fields
along the Mississippi River Basin, **[the season is filled with
doubt]{.underline}**. [After taking a hit to their bottom line in
2018]{.underline} of the sort that some say [they haven't seen since the
1980s, farmers]{.underline} in much of the U.S. [are hoping for a return
to normalcy. Trump's determination to **upend the global trading
system** comes at an **inconvenient time** for one of the nation's
premier export industries]{.underline}. No country has mastered the
science of the ever-increasing yield quite like the U.S. has. It's the
world's leading producer of commodity crops such as soybeans and corn
and a major source of apples, beef, pork, and wheat. Agriculture has
also been an important backer of successive administrations' push to
seal trade agreements around the world. Pacts such as the North American
Free Trade Agreement have spurred agricultural exports, which have grown
170 percent over the past 20 years. [Yet U.S. **farm profits** have
**been shrinking** since they peaked six years ago]{.underline},
amounting last year to roughly half what they were in 2013. [As a result
of successive years of bumper crops, prices for **key commodities** like
soybeans and corn are about 40 percent **lower** than they were in
2013]{.underline}. At the same time, [**farmers have had** to contend
with the **administration's crackdown on immigration**]{.underline},
[which deprives them of **migrant labor**, and]{.underline} **[climate
change]{.underline}**, [which most recently took the form of historic
floods that devastated Midwestern agricultural states]{.underline}. [The
[**trade
wars**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-03-05/trump-trade-war-hits-hard-video)
have come **on top of all that**]{.underline}. In the year since the
Trump administration launched its tariff offensive, [the country's trade
partners have retaliated by hiking duties on]{.underline} apples,
cherries, ginseng, sorghum, and
[soybeans](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-29/corn-calls-farmers-as-china-trade-war-erodes-u-s-soy-profits),
to name a few [crops]{.underline}. It's a familiar pattern: American
farmers have long borne the cost for protectionist policies pushed by
the country's industrialists. The 1828 "tariff of abominations" designed
to safeguard Northern manufacturers from an influx of lower-priced
imports from Britain was opposed stridently in the agrarian South. It
led to a political crisis that dogged Andrew Jackson's presidency and
precipitated South Carolina's first threats of secession.

#### Food shortages won't cause war.

**Allouche 11**, research Fellow -- water supply and sanitation @
Institute for Development Studies, frmr professor -- MIT (Jeremy, "The
sustainability and resilience of global water and food systems:
Political analysis of the interplay between security, resource scarcity,
political systems and global trade," Food Policy, Vol. 36 Supplement 1,
p. S3-S8, January)

The question of resource scarcity has led to many [debates on whether
scarcity]{.underline} (whether [of food or water]{.underline}) [will
lead to conflict]{.underline} and war. The underlining reasoning behind
most of these discourses over food and water wars [comes from the
Malthusian belief that there is an imbalance between]{.underline} the
economic availability of natural [resources and population
growth]{.underline} since while food production grows linearly,
population increases exponentially. Following this reasoning,
neo-Malthusians claim that finite natural resources place a strict limit
on the growth of human population and aggregate consumption; if these
limits are exceeded, social breakdown, conflict and wars result.
Nonetheless, it seems that **[most empirical studies do not
support]{.underline}** any of **[these]{.underline}** neo-Malthusian
**[arguments.]{.underline}** [Tech]{.underline}nological change
[and]{.underline} greater inputs of [capital have dramatically
increased]{.underline} labour [productivity]{.underline} in agriculture.
More generally, [the neo-Malthusian view has suffered
because]{.underline} during the last two centuries [humankind has
breached]{.underline} many [resource barriers that seemed
unchallengeable.]{.underline} Lessons from history: alarmist scenarios,
resource wars and international relations In a so-called age of
uncertainty, a number of **[alarmist scenarios]{.underline}** have
[linked]{.underline} the increasing [use of water resources and food
insecurity with wars.]{.underline} The idea of water wars (perhaps more
than food wars) is a dominant discourse in the media (see for example
Smith, 2009), NGOs (International Alert, 2007) and within international
organizations (UNEP, 2007). In 2007, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon
declared that 'water scarcity threatens economic and social gains and is
a potent fuel for wars and conflict' (Lewis, 2007). Of course, this type
of discourse has an instrumental purpose; security and conflict are here
used for raising water/food as key policy priorities at the
international level. **[In the Middle East]{.underline}**, presidents,
prime ministers and [foreign ministers have]{.underline} also [used this
bellicose rhetoric.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--AT: Econ\-\--2AC

#### USMCA not key to the economy -- multiple studies.

**Lynch 4-18** (David J.; Washington Post, "Trump's USMCA trade
agreement would have a limited but positive impact on U.S. economy,
report finds,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trumps-usmca-trade-agreement-would-have-a-limited-but-positive-impact-on-us-economy-report-finds/2019/04/18/b8ccb48c-6200-11e9-9ff2-abc984dc9eec_story.html)ww

President [Trump's new North American trade deal will have a marginal
effect on the]{.underline} nearly \$21 trillion [U.S. economy, boosting
output by just 0.35 percent and delivering an even smaller gain to the
labor market, according to an independent analysis by the International
Trade Commission]{.underline}. In a 379-page report released Thursday,
the ITC said the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement would "have a
positive impact" on both manufacturing and services industries. The
largest gains would arise from eliminating "uncertainty" by preventing
future barriers to cross-border e-commerce, services and investments.
"There can be no doubt that the USMCA is a big win for America's
economy," said Robert E. Lighthizer, the president's chief trade
negotiator. Notably, [the deal would increase auto parts production and
employment]{.underline}, key administration goals. [But the narrow
benefits for the auto sector would come at the expense of the broader
economy, making overall U.S. production more expensive, reducing
exports, and denting wages and employment]{.underline}, the report said.
Congress required the assessment, which was delayed five weeks by the
partial government shutdown, before lawmakers hold an up-or-down vote on
the agreement. "I don't see it as providing much ammunition to either
side. The skeptics will still be skeptical, and the advocates will still
be advocating," said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. Administration officials are
pushing for quick congressional action, but most trade analysts expect
the process to drag on for months. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)
has said tougher enforcement measures need to be written into the deal
to make sure that Mexico complies with promised labor reforms. Several
prominent lawmakers, including Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa),
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, say the president must remove
tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico and Canada before a
vote. Both countries have imposed retaliatory measures that have damaged
U.S. exports, especially from farm states. Administration officials said
last year that the tariffs would be eliminated once the three countries
reached a new trade deal. But instead, they have remained in place while
the United States tries to get Mexico and Canada to accept quotas on
their shipments of industrial metals. "This report confirms what has
been clear since this deal was announced --- Donald Trump's NAFTA
represents at best a minor update to NAFTA, which will offer only
limited benefits to U.S. workers," said Sen. Ron Wyden, (D-Ore.), the
committee's ranking member. The USMCA provides for the free flow of data
among the three trading partners, an important step for banks, airlines,
online retailers and entertainment companies. It limits an existing
procedure for companies to settle disputes with the three governments,
which the report says will discourage U.S. investment in Mexico and
boost capital spending in U.S. manufacturing and mining. An overhaul of
the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, the changes in the
USMCA are less sweeping than the broad elimination of virtually all
trade barriers in the earlier accord, economists say. NAFTA was expected
to increase the size of the U.S. economy by just 0.5 percent and boost
employment by less than 1 percent, according to the ITC's 1993 study.
Those effects exceeded what's likely from the new deal, including an
employment gain of just 176,000 jobs, or 0.12 percent, according to the
ITC. "Most trade deals don't have an outsized effect on growth over the
long term," said David Page, senior economist for AXA Investment
Managers in London. "It does tend to be a little bit peripheral." While
its top-line effects are modest, the deal would reshape North American
auto production by requiring more American content and mandating that 40
percent of each vehicle be produced by workers earning \$16 per hour ---
aimed at steering jobs away from lower-wage Mexican workers. The
administration sought to preempt the report, releasing an assessment
that concluded the deal would create 76,000 auto jobs over the next five
years and trigger \$34 billion in new auto plant investments and \$23
billion in added auto parts purchases. Current auto industry employment
is about 999,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. [The ITC
study comes after a recent International Monetary Fund study cast doubt
on USMCA's effectiveness, saying the agreement would reduce trade among
the three North American neighbors, have a "negligible" effect on
economic output and fail to bring auto jobs back to the United
States]{.underline}. "The new rules lead to a decline in the production
of vehicles and parts in all three North American countries, with shifts
toward greater sourcing of both vehicles and parts from outside of the
region," the IMF paper said. [The deal also would have no impact on
inflation-adjusted wages in the United States or Canada while resulting
in a slight decline for Mexican workers]{.underline}. [Consumers also
would face higher prices and thus buyer fewer vehicles, the study
said]{.underline}. A senior official in the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative denigrated the IMF study as reflecting the "opinions" of
its authors. The more favorable USTR conclusions were derived from
confidential business plans that major automakers submitted to the
government and that were more reliable than economic modeling, the
official said. "We have unique insights," said the official, who
insisted on anonymity to brief reporters. Changing North American trade
rules is especially important as the auto industry gears up for major
investments in autonomous and electric vehicle production, the official
said. The new deal should result in more next-generation plants in the
United States rather than in Mexico, the official said.

### Impact\-\--AT: Trade\-\--2AC

#### Trump has damaged US trade too much -- USMCA can't overcome

**Diaz 6-18** (Hugo; deputy director of international law at the Centre
for International Governance Innovation, "Think trade agreements will
mend relationships with the U.S.? Think again,"
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-think-trade-agreements-will-mend-relationships-with-the-us-think/)ww

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([USMCA]{.underline}) -- which
will replace the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) -- [has
largely been received with enthusiasm]{.underline}. U.S. President
Donald Trump called it a "very, very good deal." Former Mexican
secretary of economy Ildefonso Guajardo said that Mr. Trump's trade
threats had \"practically been defused" thanks to the agreement. Jesus
Seade, who then-president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador appointed as
his chief NAFTA negotiator, added that the agreement would bring
certainty and stability to trade in North America. The agreement was
reason for Canada to celebrate, too, and it elicited at least a sigh of
relief from other countries around the world, particularly those engaged
in trade negotiations with the United States. There has been some sense
of renewed hope that deals will bring the superpower back to our
decades-long global trajectory toward an international system of trade
rules, and rein in the worst protectionist impulses of Mr. Trump, whose
zero-sum approach assumes that one country's gain is another country's
loss. [But the USMCA **does little** to modernize or upgrade the
25-year-old]{.underline} NAFTA beyond what had been achieved in the
Obama administration's negotiations of the Trans-Pacific Partnership
Agreement; [in fact, it actually backtracks in important
areas,]{.underline} such as in the automobile sector, where stricter
rules of origin will reduce the competitiveness of North American
industry. And with trade escalation with China, and the imposition of
tariffs on Mexico (which, if Mr. Trump is to be believed, resulted in
action on migration on the southern border), [it is evident that,
**regardless of any trade agreements**]{.underline}, new or old, Mr.
[Trump will continue to use the U.S.\'s economic might and tariffs to
**push his policy objectives**]{.underline}. And rather than being a
pursuit of policy goals, it is far more likely that the reason is Mr.
Trump's hardened instinct for electoral gains. [The USMCA features
plenty of other hints of Mr. Trump's enduring anti-trade
sentiment.]{.underline} Although many dismissed the change of name as
innocuous, [it is no coincidence that the word "free" was dropped from
the title]{.underline}. But more importantly, in an exchange of side
letters attached to the deal, Mexico and Canada recognized that the U.S.
can impose tariffs on any products imported from Mexico or Canada for
alleged national-security reasons. Although they also recognize both
countries' right to retaliate if the U.S. were to impose such tariffs,
[these letters clearly reflect a move in the opposite direction from
free trade.]{.underline} Signing the USMCA didn't even really help
Ottawa or Mexico City. The U.S. didn't remove the 232 tariffs on steel
and aluminum products that it had imposed on Mexico and Canada in May
2018 until a year later -- after Mr. Trump had further escalated his
trade war with China -- in exchange for both countries removing the
tariffs that each of them had imposed on U.S. goods in retaliation. And
then [it took only a few days for Mr. Trump to **threaten**, yet again,
**to levy tariffs** not only on steel and aluminum products from
Mexico]{.underline}, **[but on all goods imported from
there,]{.underline}** for reasons unconnected to trade: Mexico's
performance on stemming the northward flow of migrants. Mr. Trump
appears to be pursuing his immigration-policy objectives to cater to his
political base as the 2020 presidential elections draw nearer. [Even the
migration deal that has since been struck between the U.S. and Mexico is
no reason to celebrate]{.underline}, as Mr. Lopez Obrador did last week
after claiming victory in the three-day long negotiations that prompted
what Mr. Trump calls an "indefinite\" suspension of the tariffs on all
Mexican goods. [Despite the optimism being expressed around the power of
trade deals to nudge the U.S. back toward certain norms, we can be sure
**this will not be the end of Mr. Trump's deployment** of **trade
weaponry**.]{.underline} Mexico, Canada and the rest of the world should
heed the writing on the wall.

#### No interdependence impact.

"Economic Interdependence and Conflict -- The Case of the US and China."
E-International Relations.
<http://www.e-ir.info/2017/01/17/economic-interdependence-and-conflict-the-case-of-the-us-and-china/>

[In 1913, Norman Angell declared that the use of military force
was]{.underline} now [economically futile as]{.underline} international
finance and [trade had become so interconnected]{.underline} that
harming the enemy's property would equate to harming your own.\[1\] [A
year later]{.underline} Europe's economically interconnected states were
embroiled in what would later become known as the First **[World
War]{.underline}**. Almost a century later Steven Pinker made a similar
claim. Pinker argues, "Though the relationship between America and China
is far from warm, we are unlikely to declare war on them or vice versa.
Morality aside, they make too much of our stuff and we owe them too much
money."\[2\] His argument rests upon [the liberal assumption that high
levels of trade]{.underline} and investment between two states, in this
case the US and China, will [make war unlikely]{.underline}, if not
impossible. It is this assumption that this essay seeks to evaluate.
This essay is divided into three sections. The first briefly outlines
the theory that economic interdependence results in a reduced likelihood
of conflict, breaking the theory down into smaller components that can
be examined. In the second section, this essay suggests that [the
premise 'more trade equals less conflict' is simplistic. It does not
take into account many of the variables that can influence]{.underline}
the strength of [economic interdependence's conflict reducing
attributes]{.underline}. Within this section, the essay considers: the
extent to which conflict cuts off trade, theories arguing that how and
what a state trades matters, Copeland's theory of trade expectations and
the differences between status quo and revisionist states. The final
section deals with the realist perspective, concentrating on arguments
pertaining to the primacy of strategic interests and arguments that
economic interdependence will increase the likelihood of conflict owing
to a reduction of deterrence credibility. Each section will be related
back to the US-China relationship with a view to assessing Pinker's
claim. The essay will conclude that **[economic
interdependence]{.underline}** does reduce the likelihood of conflict
but **[is insufficient]{.underline}** on its own **[to]{.underline}**
completely **[prevent it]{.underline}**. To calculate the likelihood of
**[conflict]{.underline}** correctly one would need to factor in the
nature of the economic interdependence alongside the strength of the
strategic interests at stake. Economic Interdependence and Conflict The
theory that increased economic interdependence reduces conflict rests on
three observations: trade benefits states in a manner that
decision-makers value; conflict will reduce or completely cut-off trade;
and that decision-makers will take the previous two observations into
account before choosing to go to war. Based on these observations, one
should expect that the higher the benefit of trade, the higher the cost
of a potential conflict. After a certain point, the value of trade may
become so high that the state in question has become economically
dependent on another. Proponents of this theory argue that if two states
have reached this point of mutual dependence (interdependence), their
decision-makers will value the continuation of trade relations higher
than any potential gains to be made through war.\[3\] It is on this
argument that Pinker rests his statement that the economic relationship
between the US and China precludes war. One can see evidence of this
when analysing US views on China as trade rises. A 2014 Chicago Council
on Global Affairs survey indicates that only a minority of Americans see
China as a critical threat, compared to a majority in the mid-1990s.
This number is even higher when analysing Americans who directly benefit
from trade with China.\[4\] As compelling as this argument may be, [high
levels of economic interdependence have not always resulted in
peace]{.underline}. The [decades preceding WW1 saw an unprecedented
growth in]{.underline} international [trade]{.underline}, communication,
and interconnectivity but needless to say, war broke out.\[5\] This
instance alone is not enough to disprove Pinker's logic. War may become
very unlikely but began nonetheless.\[6\] Let us take two hypothetical
scenarios, one in which the chances of war is 80% and the other in which
trade has reduced the likelihood of war to 10%. Just knowing that war
did indeed take place does not tell us which scenario was in play.
Similarly, the fact that WW1 took place gives us no information about
whether economic interdependence made war unlikely or not. In fact,
evidence even exists to suggest that economic linkages prevented a war
from breaking out during the sequence of crises that led up to WW1.\[7\]
However, the fact that a war as detrimental as WW1 could break out
despite a supposed reduction of the likelihood of conflict gives us an
impetus to examine whether this reduction does take place. Additionally,
if this is the case, what variables can weaken this pacifying effect?
Does Conflict Cut off Trade? Economic [interdependence theory makes the
assumption that conflict will reduce or cut-off trade. This]{.underline}
assumption **[appears]{.underline}** to be [logical]{.underline}, as one
would expect that the moment two states are officially adversaries, fear
of relative gains would ensure that policy makers want to completely
cut-off trade. [However, there are **many** historical **examples** of
trade between warring states **carrying on**]{.underline} during
wartime, [including strategic goods that directly affect the ability of
the enemy to carry out the war.]{.underline}\[8\] For example, [in the
Anglo-Dutch Wars, British insurance companies continued to insure enemy
ships and paid to replace ships]{.underline} that were being [destroyed
by their own army]{.underline}.\[9\] [Even during WW2, there are
numerous examples of American firms continuing to trade strategic goods
with]{.underline} Nazi [Germany]{.underline}.\[10\] Barbieri and Levy
argue that these examples and their own statistical analysis suggest
that the outbreak of war does not radically reduce trade between
enemies, and when it does, it often quickly returns to pre-war levels
after the war has concluded.\[11\] In response to this result, Anderton
and Carter conducted an interrupted time-series study on the effect war
has on trade in which they analysed 14 major power wars and 13 non-major
power wars. Seven of the non-major power wars negatively impacted trade
(although only four of these reductions were significant), but in the
major war category, all results bar one showed a reduction of trade
during wartime and a quick return to pre-war levels at its
conclusion.\[12\] Accompanying this contradictory finding one must take
into account that even if war does not radically reduce trade, if a
state believes that it does then potential opportunity cost would still
figure in their calculations. Variables that Impact the Pacifying Effect
of Economic Interdependence The purpose of this section is to
demonstrate that the **[pacifying effect of economic interdependence is
not constant]{.underline}**. It achieves this via a discussion of the
effect of changes in a number of variables pertaining to how and what a
state trades. Once it is established that changes in such variables may
alter the effect of economic interdependence on the likelihood of
conflict, Pinker's [statement]{.underline} ([that the level of
trade]{.underline} between the US and China [makes conflict
unlikely]{.underline}) [can be considered to be an
over-simplification.]{.underline} One variable is the relative levels of
economic dependence. Some argue that [asymmetry of trade can
**increase** the chances of conflict if the trade is more important to
one state than it is to the other; their resolve would not be reduced by
the same degree]{.underline}. [The less dependent state would be far
more willing]{.underline} than its adversary [to initiate a
conflict]{.underline}.\[13\] An example is the possibility of the
prevalent idea in China that 'Japan needs China more than China needs
Japan' leading to China becoming more assertive in Senkaku/Diaoyu
islands dispute.\[14\] It is important to recognize that all trade is
asymmetric in one fashion or another. It is radical asymmetry that one
has to fear, which at the moment does not appear to be the case in the
China-Japan or US-China case. [Another variable is the specifics of what
is being traded]{.underline}. A study by Dorussen suggests that the
pacifying effect of trade is less evident if the trade consists of raw
materials and agriculture but stronger if the trade consists of
manufactured goods. Even within the category of manufactured goods there
are differences in effect. Mass consumer goods yield the strongest
pacifying results whilst high-technology sectors such as electronics and
highly capital-intensive sectors such as transport and metal industries
tend to have a relatively weak effect.\[15\] [If it is a sector with
alternative trade avenues then embargos and boycotts as a result of
conflict will have far less effect]{.underline}.\[16\] The rule is that
[the more inelastic the import demand, the higher the opportunity
cost]{.underline} and the smaller the probability [of
conflict]{.underline}.\[17\] According to these studies, trade still
generally reduces the likelihood of conflict however it is by no means
homogeneous in its effects. Additionally, the [opportunity costs are not
the same for importers and exporters]{.underline}. Dorussen's study
suggests that [increased trade in **oil** tends to make the exporters
more hostile and the importers friendlier]{.underline} in relations to
their foreign policy.\[18\] Taking this framework into account, in 2014
China's top five exports to the US (computers, broadcasting equipment,
telephones and office machine parts) all fell under the category of
electronics,\[19\] whilst the US's top five exports to China (air and/or
spacecraft, soybeans, cars, integrated circuits and scrap copper) were
all either high-capital intensive sectors or raw materials and
agriculture.\[20\] According to Dorussen's study, these exports should
not yield the strongest possible conflict reducing results, which could
impact the validity of Pinker's statement. Copeland presents [another
variable]{.underline}, namely [expectations of trade]{.underline}.
Copeland argues that if a highly dependent state expects future trade to
be high, decision makers will behave as many liberals predict and treat
war as a less appealing option. However [if there are low expectations
of future trade]{.underline}, then [a highly dependent state will attach
a low or even negative value to continued peaceful
relations]{.underline} and war would become more likely.\[21\] As an
example, he points out that despite high levels of trade in 1914 German
leaders believed that rival great powers would attempt to undermine this
trade in the future, so a war to secure control over raw materials was
in the interests of German long-term security.\[22\] Via this framework,
[if the US began to believe that in future years they would be less
dependent on China's economy, or if it became apparent that a US-China
trade war was about to take place, there would be a sharp rise in the
probability of conflict.]{.underline} The final variable this essay will
discuss relates to the differences between status quo and revisionist
states. [Most empirical analyses]{.underline} of economic
interdependence tend to [group together states]{.underline} as different
as the United States, Pakistan, Australia, Germany and China [and assume
that variations in their behaviour would be the same]{.underline}.\[23\]
[Papayoanou]{.underline} on the other hand, [argues that when analysing
the effects of economic interdependence it is useful to
**differentiate** the effects on great power **states** and states with
revisionist aspirations]{.underline}.\[24\] If a status quo power has
strong economic ties with revisionist state there will be interest
groups who advocate engagement and who believe that confrontational
stances will threaten the political foundation of economic links. This
will constrain the response of the status quo state.\[25\] One can see
evidence of such an interest group in the US, a group Friedberg
describes as the Shanghai coalition, who he argues advocate engagement
with China at the expense of balancing.\[26\] A study by Fordham and
Kleinberg backs up this argument as they find that US business elites
who benefit from trade with China tend to see little benefit in limiting
the growth of Chinese power.\[27\] A 21st Century revisionist power is
far less likely to be a democracy, and therefore, interest groups will
influence the leadership far less. This means [**a**n authoritarian
**revisionist** power will be working under fewer constraints and will
be able to take a more **aggressive** stance.]{.underline}\[28\] This
appears to be the case in China where rather than having domestic
constraints on taking an aggressive stance against Japan, one of their
biggest trading partners, grassroots nationalism has made explicit
cooperation a domestically risky option.\[29\] There are many indicators
to suggest that China is a revisionist power willing to wage war. Lemke
and Werner argue that an extraordinary growth of military expenditures'
reveals when a state is dissatisfied with the status quo.\[30\] Data
provided by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
certainly indicates that China qualifies as its military expenditure has
nominally increased by 1270% between 1995 and 2015.\[31\] Additionally,
the military modernization appears to be aimed at capabilities to
contest US primacy in East Asia.\[32\] Much like German strategists
recognized that Britain was operating under significant domestic
constraints, China could realize the same of the US.\[33\] This is not
to say that Chinese decision-makers would be cavalier about making a
decision that would be to the detriment its economy. A crash in the
Chinese economy due to the loss of exports to the US could potentially
undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party and endanger the
regime. However, the view that China is a revisionist power indicates
that good trade relations alone will not result in a low probability of
conflict. Realist Arguments Pertaining to Dominance of Strategic
Interests Having established that if the pacifying effect of trade does
exist, it can rise or fall depending on changes in a series of variables
this essay proceeds to deal with realist theories arguing that trade has
a negligible or even negative effect on the likelihood of conflict.
Buzan argues that **[noneconomic factors contribute far more to major
phenomena than liberal theorists usually cite to support their
theory]{.underline}**.\[34\] There is evidence of the primacy of
strategic interests in [Masterson]{.underline}'s 2012 study on the
relationship between China's economic interdependence and political
relations with its neighbours. The study [concluded that]{.underline}
[as economic interdependence]{.underline} with neighbouring states
[increased]{.underline} the [likelihood of conflict did]{.underline}
indeed [decrease]{.underline}, **[but that the impact was minimal when
compared to the impact of relative power capabilities]{.underline}**. In
other words, [**political and military issues dominate**d interstate
relations]{.underline}. Growth in power disparities were associated with
decreases in dyadic political relations that were greater than the
increase caused by economic interdependence.\[35\] If the pacifying
effect of trade can rise and fall so can the provocative effect of
strategic interests. It is important to distinguish between the
existence of a strategic interest and a situation of unbearable
strategic vulnerability. China and the US have many opposing strategic
interests, but neither is in a strategically vulnerable position. For
example, China shares many borders, but none present the same threat of
invasion that Tsarist Russia did to Imperial Germany as none of the
current maritime tensions between China, Japan, and the US equate to a
matter of national survival.\[36\] This is crucial as some believe that
for a crisis to escalate to a major war an actor who is isolated and
believes that history is conspiring against them is needed. Only this
actor would take an existential risk to try and offset their strategic
vulnerability.\[37\] Imperial Germany fit this description, but neither
China nor the US does. This is largely due to the geography of the
region. The tension between the US, China and Japan are over maritime
regions. Maritime issues still relate to national interests but, as
Krause points out, "Land armies are still the only forces that can
conquer and hold territory."\[38\] Taking this into account one can
argue that the benefits of US-China trade are, for each state, currently
greater than the benefits of pursing strategic benefits via force, but
this situation will only remain as long as the situation does not become
one of unbearable strategic vulnerability. Realist Arguments Pertaining
to the Undermining of Deterrence Having established that [scenarios
exist where strategic interests and vulnerabilities have a greater
effect on the likelihood of war than economic
interdependence]{.underline}, this essay will now evaluate arguments
that economic interdependence can increase the likelihood of conflict
through the undermining of deterrence. The argument proceeds as follows:
if economic interdependence constrains the ability or willingness of a
state to use its military, security is lowered as the state now has a
weakened ability to engage in deterrence and defensive alliances.
Deterrence relies on the ability of a state to make credible threats and
defensive alliances rely on credible promises to protect one's
allies.\[39\] Credibility is defined as the product of the operational
capability to follow through with a threat and the communication of
resolve to use force.\[40\] What is at risk here is that if economic
interconnectivity interferes with the communication of resolve to use
force then states may end up with a way that neither side expected or
wanted. Some argue that it was such a failure to communicate resolve
that resulted in the beginning of WW1. Indeed, Jolly claims that: "The
Austrians had believed that vigorous actions against Serbia and a
promise of German support would deter Russia: the Russians had believed
that a show of strength against Austria would both check the Austrians
and deter Germany. In both cases, the bluff had been called and the
three countries were faced with the military consequences of their
actions."\[41\] The risk in the US-China case would be that the interest
groups described earlier would prevent the US from effectively
communicating its resolve to use force if China were to cross a redline.
The flaw in this argument lies in the fact that whilst interest groups
might push back against public statements outlining redlines; the US has
many less overt options available to it to communicate resolve. Modern
technology and the forms of interconnectivity have resulted in many more
lines of communication between China and the US than adversaries had
access to in 1914. Private meetings, electronic communication and
numerous other methods of communication have the capability to be candid
without being visible to interest groups. It is for this reason that
this essay discounts the theory that Sino-American economic
interdependence results in a reduction of deterrence and therefore
increases the likelihood of conflict. Conclusion This essay has shown
that the strength of the pacifying effect of economic interdependence is
subject to change depending on a series of dynamic variables. It has
also demonstrated that the strength of the conflict provoking effects of
strategic interests can change depending on whether the strategic
interest amounts to a situation of unbearable strategic vulnerability.
It has discounted the theory that interdependence leads to a higher
chance of conflict through an erosion of credibility. To sum up,
**[trade]{.underline}** does seem to reduce the likelihood of conflict
but **[should not be seen as a deterministic factor]{.underline}** as
[strategic interests, and vulnerabilities also have a large
effect]{.underline}. There is no hard rule as to what will be the
driving factor as the nature of economic interdependence and of
strategic factors impact their relative values. Accordingly, Pinker's
[statement that the trade]{.underline} between the US and China [makes
war exceptionally unlikely]{.underline} **[is simplistic and
misleading]{.underline}** because it fails to account for a wide array
of variables that can radically change the likelihood of a Sino-American
war. An intellectually honest thesis would insist upon a comprehensive
approach in which the level of **[economic activity is simply one of
many variables]{.underline}** that is required.

Whether President [Trump]{.underline} knows this, he's quite vulnerable
to Democratic attacks in his signature area --- trade --- which is why
he [badly needs a big victory on the issue]{.underline}. Such a victory
might include reaching a good deal with China, or getting Congress to
pass his revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But [the
top-tier 2020 [Democratic presidential
candidates](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/politics/2020-presidential-hopefuls/)
have **just made a move in unison** that could make that **latter
possibility less likely.**]{.underline} I have learned that [all of the
leading Democratic contenders have signed a statement opposing
congressional passage of Trump's renegotiated NAFTA]{.underline} unless
major changes are made. [This could make it **more difficult for
Democrats**]{.underline} --- many of whom have already criticized the
deal --- **[to pass it]{.underline}**, which could, in turn, end up
denying Trump a serious political victory going into the 2020 election.
The top-tier Democratic candidates --- Joe [Biden]{.underline},
Elizabeth [Warren]{.underline}, Bernie [Sanders]{.underline}, Pete
[Buttigieg]{.underline}, Kamala D. [Harris]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} Beto [O'Rourke]{.underline} --- have [all joined a
statement]{.underline} that was written by the [Citizens Trade
Campaign](https://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/), a coalition of groups
[pushing changes to the]{.underline} deal, which is known as the United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or [USMCA]{.underline}. [That
statement]{.underline}, which was sent my way, [says Congress should not
enact the deal "unless and until stronger labor and environmental terms
with swift and certain enforcement are added]{.underline} and language
on pharmaceutical monopolies that locks in high medicine prices is
removed." All six of those campaigns confirmed to me that they had
signed on. The USMCA alters the old NAFTA [in numerous
ways](https://www.vox.com/2018/10/3/17930092/usmca-mexico-nafta-trump-trade-deal-explained).
It requires a higher percentage of automobiles to be manufactured in the
three countries to qualify for no tariffs, and it also requires 40
percent to 45 percent of auto parts on such cars to be manufactured by
workers making at least \$16 per hour by 2023. It also expands patent
protections for drugs against generic competition. As it is, many House
Democrats want improvements to this deal, in the form of better labor
and wage standards, as well as tougher mechanisms to enforce those
standards, and they view the copyright expansion as a giveaway to Big
Pharma. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), under pressure from
labor, [recently
said](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/02/pelosi-new-nafta-mexico-1311482)
the deal won't get a House vote without changes. Trump is desperate to
get this deal through Congress, and Vice President Pence [has reportedly
been
trying](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/us/politics/pelosi-trump-nafta-deal.html)
to generate support for it in battleground House districts in the
industrial Midwest, in hopes of pressuring House Democrats to support
it. But now that [the top-tier Democratic candidates have signed on to a
statement opposing congressional approval without substantial changes,
**it could become more difficult to get it approved**]{.underline}. If
[it doesn't, Trump might have to revisit the deal with Canada and
Mexico, which he surely does not want to do.]{.underline} The changes
the Democratic candidates want are broadly in keeping with what labor
and many House Democrats want.

[Many observers]{.underline}, particularly among industry groups such as
the US Chamber of Commerce, [are]{.underline} [evincing high
hope]{.underline} [that]{.underline} Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House
[Democrats will allow a vote on the]{.underline} pending
US-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([USMCA) that would]{.underline} produce a
positive majority of Republicans and at least some Democrats,
[result]{.underline}ing [in approval by the House of
Representatives]{.underline}. Despite their venomous personal exchanges,
President Trump and Pelosi have maintained indirect contact, largely
through US Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer. Whatever the
final outcome of these ongoing negotiations, [there is
already]{.underline} a sense of déjà vu about the negotiations, and
[striking echoes from]{.underline} [a similar situation in 2008
involving]{.underline} [House trade votes, the Bush administration, and
Speaker Pelosi]{.underline}. Hopefully, this time the results will be
different, but here's how things went down in 2007-2008. Then, as now, a
midterm election (2006) had produced a Democratic majority in the House
of Representatives. Then, as now, a Republican president became
dependent on that majority to pass pending free trade agreements (FTAs)
--- in that case with Colombia, Peru, and South Korea. In May 2007,
hoping to clear the way, the Bush administration made a major concession
to the Democrats, agreeing to write into the agreements new, stronger
labor rights provisions that Republicans had opposed for over a decade
(labeled the May 10th Agreement). Subsequently, for some twelve months,
the Bush administration continued to attempt to get House Democrats to
agree to schedule votes on the three pending FTAs. Finally, growing
frustrated and sensing that time was running out for passage [before the
2008 presidential election]{.underline}, the Bush White House pulled the
trigger to force a vote, as dictated by so-called Trade Promotion
Authority (TPA). (Under TPA, Congress agrees, under certain prescribed
conditions, to an up or down vote on trade agreements within a certain
timeframe). When the president set in motion a vote within 90 days,
however, [Pelosi reneged on her promise and **postponed the vote
indefinitely**]{.underline}. She could --- and can --- do so with only a
majority vote in the House, as TPA was passed not as regular legislation
but merely as rules of each House. At the time, it was widely held that
the [Democrats bowed to **adamant labor opposition**]{.underline},
particularly to the Colombia pact negotiated during a brutal, virtual
civil war. Today, as in 2008, the White House and key business leaders
and organizations have pressed hard for a vote. And recently there have
been reports that some in the White House are again pushing for the
administration to pull the trigger and set in motion TPA-timed votes
(even though they are aware of the 2008 history). In the House,
[**Pelosi** faces a still **divided Democratic majority**]{.underline}:
[old line Progressives who **distrust all trade
agreements**]{.underline}, [and newly-elected freshmen]{.underline} who
represent swing, suburban districts more favorable to FTAs. And
importantly, [the **labor movement** that **still wants changes in the
labor chapter of the agreement**]{.underline}. Just this week, [AFL-CIO
president]{.underline} Richard [Trumka reiterated his opposition to the
USMCA in its present form.]{.underline} But there are also important
differences between 2008 and today. First, the USMCA is far more
important to the US economy than all of the 2008 FTAs combined. The
original NAFTA paved the way for a paved the way for a giant North
American economy, and the new NAFTA, whatever its minor faults, will
buttress that strength. House Democrats know this and know they could
hand Trump an issue in 2020 by seeming politically vindictive at the
expense of the US economy. Further, in response to Democratic demands
for revisions --- on labor rights, environmental rules, enforcement, and
pharmaceutical prices --- USTR Lighthizer has vowed to do "whatever it
takes" to meet their needs. Unlike his boss, Lighthizer has a good
working relationship with Pelosi and top House Democrats (Pelosi has
established working groups on each of the issues in contention). [Still,
**the clock is ticking**]{.underline}. [The administration]{.underline}
and the business community [are pressing Democrats to]{.underline} pave
the way for a [vote]{.underline} before the August recess --- **[only
seventeen legislative days away]{.underline}**. [Should that prove
impossible]{.underline}, [there will be]{.underline} growing
[pressure]{.underline} in the White House (not least from an impatient,
bullheaded president) [to set in motion TPA mandates]{.underline} for an
up or down vote. [Should that occur, **all bets would be
off**]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline} [there is certainly the
possibility that the]{.underline} 2008 **[standoff would play out
again]{.underline}**.

#### Trump will tariff Canada.

against Canada and Mexico\". FreightWaves. 6-20-2019.
https://www.freightwaves.com/news/president-trump-opens-door-for-future-tariffs-against-canada-and-mexico

President **[Trump opened the door to placing tariffs on
Canada]{.underline}** and Mexico again [in response to "tremendous
shipments of certain products." He made the remarks during an appearance
with]{.underline} Canadian Prime Minister Justin [Trudeau]{.underline}
on June 20 [ahead of a meeting]{.underline} in Washington **[to discuss
trade]{.underline}** and other issues. "[We'll see]{.underline},"
President [Trump said,]{.underline} [after a reporter asked if there
would be **more tariffs on Canada**]{.underline} and Mexico. "They have
to do what they have to do. [We can't have big, tremendous shipments of
certain products]{.underline} -- they understand that very well."
President Trump called off his planned tariffs against Mexico less than
two weeks ago. In May, the U.S. lifted its 25 percent and 10 percent
tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. [The talk of tariffs **tinged an
otherwise positive meeting** for U.S.-Canada trade
relations.]{.underline} Trump and Trudeau agreed to ratify a new
preclearance agreement for Canada and the U.S., which includes cargo.
"We can't overstate the importance of free trade to the Canada-U.S.
relationship," Trudeau said, appearing upbeat after his day of meetings
in Washington. But earlier, President [Trump]{.underline} suggested he
[was concerned about potential transshipping of products via
Canada]{.underline}. While he didn't specify a country of origin, China
is a likely candidate.

#### That kills the push

Tariffs Are in Place\". Transport Topics. 4-5-2019.
https://www.ttnews.com/articles/canada-wont-ratify-usmca-trade-deal-if-metals-tariffs-are-place

[Canada is ratcheting up pressure]{.underline} [on the U.S. to lift
tariffs on steel and aluminum]{.underline} --- [threatening]{.underline}
[to hold up the **new continental trade deal**]{.underline} and change
up its own retaliatory tariffs to have a bigger impact. [The U.S.,
Canada and Mexico signed their new trade deal Nov. 30]{.underline}, but
[it still needs to be ratified]{.underline} by lawmakers in all three
countries [and **time is running out in Canada**]{.underline} [before
the next election]{.underline}. There are increasing calls from U.S.
lawmakers to lift the tariffs in a bid to smooth passage of the trade
deal. Canada's foreign minister, Chrystia **[Freeland]{.underline}**,
[issued a warning that Canada would **only move forward** on
ratification when other countries do]{.underline}, and that it may
change its tariffs on the U.S. Meanwhile, [another envoy]{.underline}
[said flatly that Canada **won't move** ahead on ratification **as long
as the U.S. tariffs remain in place**]{.underline}, [and that
they]{.underline} fear U.S. President Donald [Trump wants
to]{.underline} [keep the tariffs]{.underline} until the trade deal is
ratified. "I think we're quite firm that [we're **not moving ahead on
ratification** **without the tariffs being lifted**,]{.underline} and I
think Mexico has signaled the same message," Joe Comartin, Canada's
consul general to Detroit, said in a telephone interview April 4 after
visiting members of Congress in Washington last week. [Time is running
out in Canada and the U.S]{.underline}., he said. "[There's a **real
risk**]{.underline} at this point that if we don't move very quickly in
both countries that [**it won't be passed before the next election** in
the United States."]{.underline} U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has
been pushing for certain changes in exchange for advancing the trade
deal, including tougher enforcement of labor rules in Mexico --- though
she said April 4 she won't leverage the deal to advance other Democratic
priorities. Regardless, the metals tariffs are a barrier.
[Freeland]{.underline}, speaking April 3 in Ottawa, said that every
country is now responsible for its ratification process, but
[warned]{.underline} [Canada wouldn't leap ahead and ratify if the other
two nations aren't doing the same.]{.underline} "We think that the best
approach for Canada, and really the best approach for all the Nafta
countries, is for us to move forward in a coordinated way when it comes
to the Nafta ratification," she said. "That is the approach Canada is
taking and will be taking." Freeland underscored the message April 4 in
Washington, and warned against any push to reopen the deal to address
Pelosi's concerns. "Canada's view is we've done our deal," she told
reporters April 4. "People need to be very careful around opening up
what could really be a Pandora's box." Many Canadians have a hard time
understanding how Canada could ratify the deal if the tariffs remain in
place, she said. [The U.S. applied]{.underline} 25% [steel]{.underline}
tariffs [and]{.underline} 10% [aluminum tariffs to Canada]{.underline}
last year, and Canada responded with dollar-for-dollar proportional
tariffs of its own on U.S. steel, aluminum and other products.
[Freeland]{.underline} called on the U.S. to lift the tariffs and said
she was encouraged by calls from key U.S. lawmakers to do so, but also
[said Canada might switch its tariffs to different products to make a
point.]{.underline} "We are always looking at whether the list we have
is the right one --- both for Canada and also to have the greatest
impact. That is an ongoing discussion," she said.

Out on USMCA as Trump Walks Back Mexico Tariffs,\" 6-10-2019, Fortune,

"[We're not ready,]{.underline}'' Representative Debbie
[Dingell]{.underline}, a [Michigan Democrat, said Sunday]{.underline} on
Fox News. "[The votes in the House are **not there yet**]{.underline}
until these changes take place.'' During last week's uncertainty over
trade with Mexico, [most Democrats publicly separated USMCA
deliberations from Trump's tariff plan, which means that **removing the
tariff** threat **doesn't necessarily clear the way** for a **new
deal**]{.underline} to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[Dingell]{.underline} said she [wants changes to the agreement's labor,
environmental and enforcement provisions]{.underline} that would satisfy
her skeptical colleagues. Deciding against the Mexican tariffs does,
however, help the president with his own party --- especially in the
Republican-led Senate. Revamped Nafta Finance Committee Chairman Chuck
Grassley of Iowa warned last week that the USMCA --- Trump's top
legislative priority this year --- would be in peril if the president
went ahead with the Mexican tariffs. House Republicans for weeks have
said the revamped trade deal, which updates but doesn't fundamentally
alter the decades-old NAFTA, would pass the House if only Pelosi would
put it on the floor. Louisiana Representative Steve Scalise, a top
member of GOP leadership, renewed that call Friday after Trump said he
won't impose tariffs on Mexico, lauding the breakthrough that "puts us
in a better position to make USMCA a reality." The lawmaker working
groups that Pelosi appointed to negotiate with U.S. Trade Representative
Robert Lighthizer are beginning to drill down on the details of how to
resolve Democrats' outstanding issues, according to the aide, who asked
not to be named when talking about internal discussions. Pelosi has
repeatedly said that her members "want to get to yes," but only if the
agreement resolves their doubts. Democrats have pushed Mexico to pass
and swiftly implement labor reforms that would, among other things,
allow workers there to vote for union representation with a closed
ballot. 2020 Timing [Trade in general has become a complicated
ideological and electoral issue since Trump in his 2016 campaign
denounced Nafta]{.underline} as the worst example of globalism run amok
with little regard for U.S. workers. Trump's position sets him apart
from free-trade Republicans, and [it]{.underline} also [creates a
dilemma for 2020 Democratic candidates.]{.underline} Democrats
traditionally have been more skeptical than Republicans when it comes to
free trade. [The 2020 presidential race also **squeezes the timing** for
a vote on the bill to implement the USMCA]{.underline}. [Lawmakers of
both parties have warned that **passing such a deal will be politically
tricky** in an **election year**]{.underline}. That means the best
chance for a vote would be before Congress recesses in August to avoid
typical end-of-the-year budget fights, according to North Carolina
Representative Mark Meadows, a close Trump ally. "Hopefully, we can get
together and make sure that happens in the latter part of July,''
Meadows said on Fox News's "Sunday Morning Futures.''

### Impact\-\--AT: Pharma\-\--1AR

#### Mergers thump\-\--innovation low now

October 2016, \"Is industry consolidation stifling pharma innovation?,\"

In a year of "[merger mania]{.underline}," [researchers suggest the
**elimination of competition is reducing innovation** in the
pharmaceutical industry]{.underline}. Earlier this year, PwC told us
that this so-called "merger mania" could leave strategic contract
research organizations (CROs) vulnerable in 2016. In fact, mergers
topped the research institute's annual list of top health industry
issues. "[Over the past couple years \[we have\] seen a **tremendous
amount of acquisition**]{.underline}," said James Prutow, advisory
partner, PcW. And as M&A increases, researchers at the Düsseldorf
Institute for Competition Economics (DICE), Germany, Joel Stiebale and
Justus Haucap, suggest innovation does the opposite. According to the
researchers, within the sample of pharmaceutical companies, [innovation
activities]{.underline} -- which were measured by patents and R&D
expenditures -- [decline substantially, both for the merged entity and
among its non-merging competitors]{.underline} after M&As. "While a
reduction in innovation of merging firms could in principle be due to
efficient elimination of duplicated R&D, our results for competitors
indicate that [**innovation declines** due to a reduction of competition
induced by mergers]{.underline}," Stiebale told us. For the researchers,
[these results raise concerns about the negative
consequences]{.underline} for patients [in the long run]{.underline},
given the rate of M&A in the industry**.**

DOA: 9-15-17, y2k

[For **the first time**]{.underline} [in 10 years]{.underline} global
[sales of]{.underline} [pharmaceuticals]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
[forecast]{.underline} by Evaluate [to **take a downturn**]{.underline}
[because of]{.underline} **[growing pricing pressures]{.underline}**.

Analysts at the group are projecting that sales will hit \$1.06 trillion
in 2022, down from the \$1.12 trillion forecast last year for the same
period.

[The fall]{.underline} also [marks]{.underline} **[the first time in a
decade]{.underline}** of Evaluate analysis [that total]{.underline} drug
[sales]{.underline} have [failed to beat]{.underline}
[previous]{.underline} year [forecasts]{.underline}, the group noted.

"[The]{.underline} [continued]{.underline} **[political]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[public scrutiny]{.underline}** [over

going to go away** and **we are starting to feel the impact now**," said
Antonio Iervolino, head of forecasting at Evaluate.]{.underline}

"[Market access is becoming **harder**]{.underline}," [and]{.underline}
"[the]{.underline} **[increasing cost]{.underline}** [of taking a novel

**[sustainability]{.underline}**," he added.

Cancer immunotherapies like Keytruda (pembrolizumab) and Opdivo
(nivolumab) are expected to help drive the sector to its expected
trillion dollar sales target, while orphan drugs are now set to make up
a third of pharma sales by 2022 despite questions over their cost,
according to the World Preview report.

In other headline predictions: **[patent expiries]{.underline}**
[could]{.underline} **[wipe out \$194 billion]{.underline}** [worth of
pharma sales]{.underline} during 2016-2022, potentially [**signalling**
a second patent cliff]{.underline}; AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab) will
continue to be the leading product in the USA in 2022, with sales of
\$12.0 billion; and Keytruda is due to knock off Opdivo as the
top-selling PD-1/PD-L1 product.

### 2AC- Prices Turn

#### USMCA skyrockets drug prices.

**Wirtz & Kaplan 19** \-\-- Veronika J. Wirtz and Warren A. Kaplan,
professors at the Boston University School of Public Health and research
fellows at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center,
(\"\'Big Pharma\' is the big winner of the USMCA,\" 6-23-2019, TheHill,

accessed 7-1-2019) bm

The longstanding debate in the United States on its sky-high
prescription drug prices and access to health care is raging where you
might least expect it --- within the pages of President Trump's new
trade deal: the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). [Critics of the
USMCA are very concerned that it would increase medicine prices in North
America and **strengthen** the hand of one of the world\'s **most
powerful industries.**]{.underline} At Boston University's Global
Development Policy Center and School of Public Health, we have been
studying the impact of trade treaties on access to medicines and can
confirm that there is real truth to these concerns. They require policy
action. At issue is is a section of [the USMCA that would protect
pharmaceutical companies with new biologics from generic competition,
so-called \"**biosimilars**.\"]{.underline} Biologic medicines come from
living cells that contain proteins and other materials that can treat
diseases and conditions like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple
sclerosis. "**[Biosimilar]{.underline}**" [medicines are similarly
composed drugs]{.underline} that are approved for marketing when
presenting data demonstrating that [there is no clinically meaningful
difference in their safety]{.underline}, [quality and
efficacy]{.underline} from the original biologic. [Biologics have been
found to be the **most significant driver** of **prescription medicine
prices**]{.underline}. Citing a report by IQVIA Institute, Forbes
magazine reported that "[biologic drugs represented 2 percent of all
U.S. prescriptions, but **37 percent of net drug
spending**]{.underline}. [Since 2014, biologic drugs account for nearly
all of the growth in net drug spending: **93 percent of it**, in
fact."]{.underline} For this reason, many have argued to lower the
number of years for biologic exclusivity, not increase them. Even though
only 2 percent of patients in the U.S. use biologic medicines, they
represent 40 percent of total prescribing drug expenditure. It has been
estimated that biosimilar medicine costs on average 30-percent less than
the originator biologic medicine. Promotion of biosimilar medicines in
the U.S. could save consumers billions of dollars. According to Federal
Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the anticompetitive
tactics used by manufacturers of biologic medicines are one reason
market entry of biosimilar medicines is so slow. A new tactic is [the
USMCA]{.underline}, which under Article 20 F. 14 [would grant at least a
10-year "test data" exclusivity period for new biologics]{.underline}.
Currently, Canada has an eight-year test data exclusivity period and
Mexico has a five-year limit, so [the USMCA would force both countries
to increase this period. Granting exclusivity essentially gives a
pharmaceutical company **monopoly rights** that free the firm from
competition and allows it to charge **higher prices** than it would
under competitive conditions. In a comprehensive review of the
literature, we find that, generally, exclusivity rules like these in
past trade agreements have **tended to raise the prices of
medicines.**]{.underline} In fact, in a study we did specific to
biologics, we found that provisions that protect biologics in the
U.S.-Chile Free Trade Agreement increased the unit price of biologics in
Chile. In many ways, these measures are a form of mercantilism for the
interests of firms in leading economic sectors, rather than \"free
trade\" that would create more competition and lower prices. Indeed, the
pharmaceutical industry is the most active lobby group when it comes to
trade agreements. One analysis of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
--- a deal that was scrapped --- stated that it ended up having many of
the same provisions for pharmaceuticals and biologics that the USMCA
has. That analysis by Sunlight Foundation found that pharmaceutical
companies and their associations mentioned the TPP in 251 separate
lobbying reports --- two-and-a-half times more than the next-most active
industry, the auto sector. [Pharmaceutical companies argue that since
test data is so expensive to produce, it is an unfair advantage to let
other companies rely on that data without cost]{.underline}. Biologics
research and development is supposedly a higher-risk endeavor, with:
higher capital costs, higher material costs, greater manufacturing costs
and uncertainties, longer development times, and lower late-stage
success rates compared to biosimilar drugs. According to pharma, a
failure to include substantial data exclusivity as part of a statutory
framework for "biosimilars" would undermine incentives to invest in
biomedical innovation and thus would slow progress in the development of
breakthrough therapies for patients suffering from currently untreatable
conditions. [**Recent research** published in Nature Biotechnology
**calls this rationale into question**]{.underline}. [The authors found
**no evidence** that developing biologic drugs was **more
time-intensive** than traditional small-molecule (biosimilar)
medicines.]{.underline} The study\'s lead author wrote: \"Our study
shows that biologic and small molecule drugs take a similar amount of
time to develop through clinical trials. Policies intended to extend
exclusivity periods for biologics, as Canada is now doing due to the
USMCA trade deal, should not be justified by pointing to longer
pre-market development times for biologic drugs.\" [Given the new
evidence that developing biologic drugs is not more time-intensive, it
is necessary to **reconsider** the **period of market
exclusivity**]{.underline} for such innovation that would not unduly
favor one type over others. Whatever reward for innovation the
policymakers choose, it should not impede access to such innovation for
those who most need it.

#### The impact is 125 thousand deaths per year

Bitter Pill to Swallow?\". Forbes. 5-17-2019.

If we're ever going to lower the exorbitant costs Americans pay for
healthcare in the U.S., we need to start looking at the problem
holistically. While drug prices are often in the news, it's not the only
challenge American's face. In fact, while [nearly a **quarter** of the
population has]{.underline} [trouble paying **prescription drug
prices**]{.underline}, medical bills are an even bigger issue, as they
are now the leading cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. Identifying and
treating one symptom of the problem isn't going to cure the underlying
epidemic. Consider, for example, what happens when a patient skips
filling their prescription. As former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop
once said, "[Drugs don't work in patients who don't take
them]{.underline}." [By one estimate]{.underline}, [lack of drug
adherence causes **approximately 125,000 deaths per year in the
U.S.**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} least [10 percent of
hospitalizations]{.underline}. Besides the loss of life, [this
is]{.underline} [estimated to cost the American health care system
between \$100 billion and **\$289 billion** a year.]{.underline}

#### Rising costs crush US economic leadership\-\--extinction

[The multilateralist global system that the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and the West
[built]{.underline} after the end of the Second World War [was premised
on an **economically strong**]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and West. In 1945, the United States was the only
victor that was not completely devastated. World War II had brought the
country out of the Great Depression, and the US GDP constituted more
than 50 percent of the world's total. Into the twenty-first century, the
members of the Group of Seven (G7) were the world's political and
economic heavyweights. It has only been in the past several years that
the collective GDP of the developing world---led by China---has
surpassed the developed world's. Even as non-Western powers grow, it is
psychologically hard for the West to think about relinquishing its
reins. Demographically, the West has, for a long time, been in the
minority. What's more recent is [the aging of the Western
population]{.underline} (analyzed in chapter 2), which [is]{.underline}
already occurring in Japan and Europe, [beginning to squeeze the
availability of resources for anything but health]{.underline}, social
security, and interest payments on debt. [Unless **healthcare** becomes
far more efficient, the US economy will be **overburdened** with
healthcare and pension costs as the "baby boomer" generation
ages]{.underline}. [Healthcare constitutes a whopping **18 percent of
the US GDP**---significantly more than is the case for other
industrialized countries---without necessarily providing better
results]{.underline}. [With more going to health and pensions, there
will be **less capacity for defense** and military
spending]{.underline}. The United States is the biggest military
spender, but [China is increasing its]{.underline} portion of worldwide
[military spending, while the worldwide share of]{.underline} European
[NATO members is diminishing]{.underline}. [China's
military]{.underline} probably will not rival the United States'
power-projection capabilities even by 2035, but it [will have greater
anti-access and denial powers]{.underline}. In a military contest, China
may never be able to deliver a knockout blow, but it could tarnish the
US image of military invincibility in a conventional state-on-state
contest held in its region. Equally, [a confrontation that results in a
Chinese humiliation could]{.underline} set back China's aspirations for
regional leadership, if not [trigger a **domestic legitimacy crisis**
for the Communist Party leadership]{.underline}. Biggest Problem Is
Domestic The biggest psychological blow to ordinary Western citizens has
been their sagging standard of living (more analysis in chapter 1).
Despite a much better record of overall growth in the United States
since the 2008 financial crisis, those with median incomes have taken a
hit Worrisome for future US growth potential has been the drop in the
labor-participation rate, from the 67 percent range before the 2008
financial crisis to 62-63 percent in the years since. The
labor-participation rate was destined to drop due to a growing numbers
of retirees, but much of the current sharp decrease comes from unskilled
males in their prime working years---forties and early
fifties---dropping out. Additionally, many younger women are not
entering or staying in the job market. Global Trends 2030 looked at two
scenarios for future US growth---one in which the United States
maintained or slightly increased its average 2.5 percent pre-2008 growth
rate, or one in which growth would slow to an average of 1.5 percent a
year. In the first, there would still be the global economic shift to
China. On the other hand, the 2.5 percent average growth would help
boost average living standards, engendering a "feel-good" factor, which
would make more Americans interested in reengaging with world issues.91
[Given the record of slower growth and labor-force decline since the
2008 financial crisis, the **likelihood** of the second scenario is
**increasing**]{.underline}. [That scenario anticipated lower growth
rates---which accelerated declines in average living standards---making
it harder to continue trade-liberalization efforts]{.underline}. Indeed,
the IMF warned in June 2016 that [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [faces potentially significant longer-term
challenges to strong and sustained growth]{.underline}, saying,
"concerted [policy actions are warranted, sooner rather
than]{.underline} later... [focusing on]{.underline} the causes and
consequences of falling labor force participation, an increasingly
polarized income distribution, high levels of poverty, and [weak
productivity]{.underline}."92 Moreover, it is not as if traditional US
partners---Europe and Japan---are doing much better. Japan and many
European countries are aging faster than the United States, eliminating
labor-force growth as a driver of future economic growth. Europe's and
Japan's economic performances have been declining since the 1990s. In
Europe, the public discontent with high unemployment and declining
incomes has helped to spur the rise of antiestablishment far-right and
populist parties that want to weaken the EU and transatlantic ties. Even
in richer European countries, such as Germany, a backlash has been
growing against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
(TTIP), out of fear that Europe's rewards would be meager and European
standards would be diluted. McKinsey Global Institute, for example,
believes a "return to sustained growth of 2-to-3 percent" is possible
for Europe, but would require many politically difficult reforms.93
These include: reducing dependence on imports (much coming from Russia)
for crude oil and natural gas; fostering a more vibrant digital economy;
increasing workforce participation by the elderly, women, and migrants;
and promoting flexibility in labor markets. China now spends a greater
share of its GDP on research and development than does Europe. The
latest OECD figures show that Europe now spends even less than the rest
of the OECD.94 In both the United States and Europe, there is increasing
anti-immigrant sentiment despite documented economic benefits from
immigration. According to EU Commission Employment Analyst Dr. Jorg
Peschner, productivity, by itself, will not be enough to reverse the
negative employment trend absent more immigration: "EU's productivity
growth would have to double in order to keep the EU's economy growing at
the same pace as it did before the crisis started." For employment
growth to remain positive as long as possible, improving the labor
participation of women, low-educated people, and migrants will also have
to be a priority. In the United States, many of the new businesses
started every year are started by first- or second-generation
immigrants.95 [Politically, there has been a large rise in support for
right-wing and **populist parties**]{.underline} in the United States
and Europe, undermining traditional parties. The gaps, for example,
between the leadership and supporters in the US Republican and UK Tory
and Labor Parties have been particularly [evident in the selection
of]{.underline} Donald [Trump]{.underline} as presidential candidate and
the June 2016 victory of the "Leave" vote in Britain. Unfortunately,
there is no end of economic disruption. [The job churn will continue as
more and more skills and professions are automated, also increasing the
**potential** for more "losers" from globalization, greater political
polarization, and inequality]{.underline}. [The increased
competitiveness of the developing world with the West is a particular
morale buster for Western middle classes who got used to ever-increasing
prosperity for themselves and succeeding generations]{.underline}.
[Adapting to a new norm of economic turbulence---more prevalent in other
eras---may be one of the biggest mental hurdles for
Westerners]{.underline}. The West is used to thinking of the "Third
World," not home, as the place where economic turmoil happens. And a
Multipolar Financial Architecture, Too [Historically, US and Western
power has rested on having a **monopoly on reserve currencies** and a
Western-dominated financial system]{.underline}. In 2035, the dollar
will be the biggest reserve currency, but its share of global financial
transactions is expected to drop from 60 percent today to 45 percent.
The euro will probably remain the second reserve currency, while the
Chinese yuan or RMB---which became a part of the IMF benchmark-currency
basket in 2015---will become a third reserve currency, accounting for 10
to 15 percent of global finance in two decades' time.96 [The financial
architecture will]{.underline} also [become more
regionalized]{.underline}. The central role played by the financial
centers of New York and London will also diminish, and a multitiered
financial architecture will develop. Following the UK Brexit, those
centers' share in financial intermediation will decrease, as a second
pole of global finance forms in the Eurozone. A third pole will develop
in East Asia and Southeast Asia. Gradually, a growing share of global
financial resources will be concentrated in those regional clusters. As
with the growth of regional trade, the regional clusters will be more
self-encapsulated, spurred by rising domestic demand in China and other
developing countries with growing middle classes. With the role of
electronic money likely to grow, the traditional banking system will
probably also undergo major revision, with potential impacts on
governmental powers. A more multipolar reserve system and regionalized
financial architecture should lessen risks and contribute to greater
stability. But the large-scale technological innovations---some of which
contributed to the 2008 breakdown---will continue, making global finance
still volatile. Emerging-market countries with fragmentary regulatory
regimes will be particularly prone to suffering financial crises. The
aging-population factor also increases risks to public finances. This
report anticipates modestly increased volatility, lower than what
occurred in the global economy during the 1890s through the 1940s, but
higher than in the 1950s and 1960s---more of a continuation of what has
been the trend line since the mid-1980s. Are There Alternative Visions
to Western Order? Four years ago, when Global Trends 2030 was published,
the answer was largely no.97 Increasingly, the facts on the ground would
suggest otherwise. They do not add up to a cohesive plan to substitute
wholesale all Western institutions and practices. However, they clearly
indicate that there are some no-go areas, particularly those connected
to regime change, democracy promotion, state control over NGOs, and
maintaining sovereignty. [Russia and China]{.underline}, in particular,
[see themselves as great powers and]{.underline}, as such, [believe they
have special rights to dominance in their regions]{.underline}. However,
[as other powers like India develop, it is likely that they will see
themselves as regional powers with inherent prerogatives]{.underline}.
It is worth recalling the United States' expansive Manifest Destiny and
nineteenth-century Monroe Doctrine, claiming special rights to determine
the future of the Western Hemisphere. The Mercator Institute for China
Studies (MERICS) has been closely following Beijing's efforts to build a
network of parallel structures to existing international organizations.
It has concluded that China "is not seeking to demolish or exit from
current international organizations...It is constructing
supplementary--- in part complementary, in part competitive---channels
for shaping the international order beyond Western claims to
leadership."98 As the accompanying chart indicates, China's shadow
network of alternative international structures encompasses everything
from financial and economic partnerships (the Silk Road Economic Belt
and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) to full-blown political
groupings like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Conference on
Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), and the
BRICS association of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.99
Moreover, there is increasing cooperation among many of the emerging
powers---beyond just authoritarians---to not just limit what they see as
Western meddling in domestic affairs, but to go on the attack globally.
According to a recent academic study, the "Big Five" authoritarian
states of China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela "have taken
more coordinated and decisive action to contain democracy on the global
level." They have sought to "alter the democracy and human-rights
mechanisms of key rules-based institutions, including the Organization
of American States, the Council of Europe, the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, and international bodies concerned with the
governance of the Internet."100 How durable are these preferences for
nondemocracy and state control? By 2035, if not sooner (in the case of
Venezuela), some of the now-authoritarian states could be liberalized,
and the perceived threat posed by Western civil-society NGOs may ease.
However, China and Russia are more likely than not to want to dominate
their regions. Nationalism and democracy have been shown to be highly
compatible. It is not clear that an even more powerful China or India
would defer to Western leadership of the global order, even if both
sides' values in other areas begin to converge. What Kind of
Post-Western World? [Clearly, there is a need to plan for a world that
will not have the West as its big economic powerhouse]{.underline}---a
prospect hard for Western elites and publics to conceive of, despite a
decade or more of publicity about the "rise of the rest." According to a
recent survey, Europeans and Americans are more comfortable with each
other than they are with anybody else. Although a majority of Europeans
said, in the most recent German Marshall Fund transatlantic-trends
polling, that they would like to see their country take an approach more
independent from the United States, both Americans and Europeans still
prefer each other over more Russian or Chinese leadership in the world.
The Obama administration---considered among the most multilateralist of
recent administrations--- campaigned hard in 2015 to convince Europeans
not to join China's proposed Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank
(AIIB). It was as if the United States was against any governance
structure not "made in the USA," even when those running the AIIB have
made clear their intentions of operating with the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank. More and more, the talk among Western elites is
about locking in as much as possible the status quo, which favors the
West, so that it will be harder for the newcomers to overcome. The TPP
was sold as a way to set the rules before China gains much more power. A
former Obama administration official advised that now might be the best
time to undertake UN Security Council reform, before China and other
uncooperative powers become more powerful. "A new US administration may
be able to advance a proposal to address the Security Council's
anachronistic makeup while perpetuating a council that Washington can
work with."101 For Westerners, [the challenge will be to plan for a
future that will not be solely run by them, but which they can live
with]{.underline}. [Handovers have been **historically** difficult and
fraught---more often than not, decided by **bloody
contests**]{.underline}. [One could envisage]{.underline} different
scenarios, some already described in the earlier chapter on conflict, of
[**military contests** between the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and China, or the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and China with Russia, or the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [with NATO against
Russia]{.underline}. Without delivering a knockout blow by one side or
the other, [these contests would most likely pit West against East,
creating something akin to a **new Cold War**]{.underline}. [Even if
there were a knockout blow by the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [against China, it is hard to imagine a defeated
China deferring permanently to the West]{.underline}. Its population has
been imbued with such a narrative about the injustices by the West
against China that any defeat or setback would be confirmation that the
United States and West are dead set against a rising China. Perhaps the
most harmful effect of such a contest would be to convince both sides
that neither is trustworthy. For the non-West, it would confirm the
suspicion that the West does not want to relinquish its leadership
position. For the West, [it would make it harder to ever reach out and
help **establish a truly global system**]{.underline}. Need for a
Second-Generation US and Western Leadership Model [War is
not]{.underline}, and should not be, [inevitable]{.underline} as the
West struggles with the growing clout of China and other developing
states on the world stage. [Unlike during other transitions, the tools
exist for ensuring more peaceful outcomes]{.underline}. [They will
require Western acquiescence to greater roles for the developing world
to set and implement new rules of the road for the international
order]{.underline}. A key feature of the post-1945 US design for the
world order is its multilateralist structures. Many of these operate
below most people's radar. This plumbing of the international system has
enabled the daily functioning of globalization. To keep it viable,
China, as well as other developing countries, must be accorded more
representation. There are too many long-term risks involved, for
example, in China having only the equivalent of France's voting rights
in the IMF, when it is the first or second economic power in the world.
This is how resentments are nurtured---all the more dangerous in China's
case because of its underlying "century of humiliation" mental complex.
[As **emerging technologies** come online, the lack of a truly global
institutional framework could be **particularly
dangerous**]{.underline}. [Assuring the future security of the Internet
is particularly important in this regard, because all the new emerging
technologies---bio, 3D printing, robotics, big data---take for granted a
secure, global Internet]{.underline}. Everyone loses if cyber crime and
cyber terrorism undermine the Internet. [In the worstcase scenarios, in
which cyber crime proliferates or strong national borders fragment the
Internet]{.underline}, an Atlantic Council study, as mentioned, found
that [the **economic costs** could be as much as \$**90 trillion** out
to 2030, in addition to the risk of **open conflict**]{.underline}.102
Besides bringing the emerging powers into leadership roles in the
panoply of multilateral institutions, the United States will need to
temper its often "exemptionalist" stance to ensure the survival of the
multilateralist order. According to the Council on Foreign Relations'
Patrick Stewart, a prominent scholar of global governance, one of the
persistent paradoxes of the post-1945 decades has been that the "United
States is at once the world's most vocal champion of a rules-based
international order and the power most insistent on opting out of the
constraints that it hopes to see binding on others."103 [No country has
the networks and connections that the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [does, but the system is now polycentric, rather
than unipolar]{.underline}, and others resent the "exceptional"
privileges that the United States claims. The Global Trends works have
talked about the need for a new model of US global leadership. The
United States needs to be guiding the international system as a "first
among equals," and willing to play by its own rules. Paradoxically,
[there is likely to be no vibrant global-governance system without
US]{.underline} and Western [leadership]{.underline}, but too much
domineering behavior could doom it. Even if the United States adapted
its global role, this is not to say that the tensions and differences
with many emerging powers would all disappear, or that the governance
system would function seamlessly. In addition to the growing number of
new state actors, [the increasing importance of nonstate actors adds a
new complexity to the functioning of global institutions]{.underline}.
Moreover, there are clear-cut differences between the West and emerging
powers on values-based issues, such as democracy promotion and the
responsibility to protect. Many developing-country publics still resent
Western colonialism and equate any intrusion with past historical wrong.
They point to the 2011 humanitarian intervention in Libya, for example,
as cover for the Western goal of regime change. Hence, the UN Security
Council failure to stop the fighting in Syria, with more than two
hundred thousand killed and 7.6 million displaced. Russia and China want
to make a stand against the United States and the West getting their way
and ousting the Assad regime. On the other hand, [the lack of a solution
smacks more of **anarchy** than global governance]{.underline}.
Certainly, it shows one of the gaps that remains, and likely will
remain, limiting global governance because of differences in values.
[The **speed** with which **new tech**nologies are coming online and
becoming an **important political, military, and economic tool**---for
both good and bad---carries **big risks** for global
governance]{.underline}. Stewart Patrick lists four potential [new
technologies that "cry out for regulation":]{.underline}
[**geoengineering**, drones, synthetic biology, and
nanotechnology]{.underline}. [Without some **setting of rules** for
their operation, there is the risk of **major** disruptions, if not
**catastrophes**, stemming from their abuse]{.underline}. [The recent
advances in **synthetic biology** lower the bar to abuse by amateurs and
**terrorists** alike, forever affecting human DNA]{.underline}.
[**Geoengineering** involves planetaryscale interventions that could
interfere with complex climatic systems]{.underline}. However
cumbersome, politically unpopular, and ineffective at times, [there is
**little alternative** to increased global cooperation if one does not
want to see higher risks of conflict and economic
degradation]{.underline}. [Without some sort of bolstered global
governance, the West would end up with less sovereignty in a
**"dog-eat-dog" world**]{.underline}, in which it was increasingly in
the minority. [But can the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and the West rise to the challenge of investing in
a global-governance system that will not always favor their interests on
every issue?]{.underline} Historically, the United States could be
especially generous because it was on top of the world in about
everything after the Second World War. Europeans came to truly believe
in pooling sovereignty and joint governance after centuries of
internecine conflict. [The **tough economic times** at home have seen US
and European publics become **distrustful** of overarching multilateral
institutions, believing the will of the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates or individual European
countries [will not be served]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline}
oftentimes [easier for political leaders to fall in with the public mood
rather than display leadership that might appear to work against
it]{.underline}. [The breakdown of the post-Cold War political and
security order is **irrevocable**]{.underline}. [Not only are there new
powers---particularly China---that do not share the West's vision of a
liberal order, but Western publics themselves have turned against
globalization]{.underline}, which has been the overall megatrend of the
past three decades. [The geopolitical landscape ahead will be much
different]{.underline}. The best case is looking at multipolarity with
limited multilateralism. [In the worst case, that multipolarity
**evolves into bipolarity** with China, Russia, and their partners
pitted against the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Europe,
Japan, and other allies]{.underline}. [In that scenario, conflict would
be almost **inevitable**]{.underline}.

### \-\--1AR- High Prices kill econ

#### Rising healthcare costs affect *[every economic indicator]{.underline}* and produce a structural drag on growth\-\--risks national security.

**Schaeffer & Goldman 17** (Leonard D. Schaeffer, professor @ USC, CEO

"Healthcare reforms are real prescription for American economic growth",
http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/healthcare/334573-healthcare-reforms-are-real-prescription-for-american-economic
accessed 8-10-2017) bm

[Businesses are wrong to blame taxes for strangling American
competitiveness]{.underline}, he said. **[The real culprit is healthcare
costs.]{.underline}** Corporate taxes as a percentage of gross domestic
product have actually gone down over the past 50 years and now hover at
about 2 percent. Meanwhile, **[the American healthcare system consumes
nearly 18 percent of GDP]{.underline}**, up from 13.1 percent in 1995.
Buffett's main point was that [healthcare costs are the bigger threat to
business]{.underline}. [A Kaiser Family Foundation study]{.underline},
for example, [found that corporations now spend]{.underline}
~~\$12,591~~ [\[\$12.5 thousand\] on average for insurance for a family
of four, up 54 percent since 2005]{.underline}. But the danger goes much
further. [**Healthcare costs are a threat to the entire economy,** not
just to business**. Left to current market forces,** those costs will
result in **higher government deficits, increased borrowing,** and
eventually **higher taxes on everyone, both personal and corporate.** By
2040, the government projects **healthcare will consume one-quarter of
the economy.**]{.underline} The connection between healthcare spending
and the national deficit is rarely made in congressional debate. That is
not a good thing. [Healthcare costs are rapidly overwhelming both state
and federal budgets, while raising costs for businesses that provide
health insurance to their employees]{.underline}. [As
former]{.underline} [C]{.underline}ongressional [B]{.underline}udget
[O]{.underline}ffice [head]{.underline} Alice [Rivlin]{.underline} [puts
it,]{.underline} "**[long-run fiscal policy is health
policy]{.underline}**." What can we do to control these costs? First,
recognize that we are not getting what we think we are paying for.
[Spending more on healthcare does not mean better health]{.underline}.
The RAND Health Insurance Experiment, for example, found that families
provided with [free care spent nearly 50 percent more on medical care
than those in high-deductible
plans](http://www.rand.org/health/projects/hie.html) but did not
experience any measurable differences in average population health. The
[Dartmouth Atlas](http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/) tells a similar story
in Medicare: regions that spend more on treatment do not have better
outcomes. Evidence shows that [**the U.S. healthcare system is laden
with fat and overpays for care,** much of which is unnecessary and not
evidence-based]{.underline}. According to Health Affairs, **[multiple
studies]{.underline}** have **[conclude]{.underline}**d **[that 30
percent or more of U.S. health spending is wasteful]{.underline}**.
Despite widely outspending other developed countries, we have poorer
outcomes, including higher infant mortality, greater prevalence of
chronic conditions and shorter lifespans. Second, accelerate a shift in
focus from treatment to prevention. We know that it is cheaper to reduce
high cholesterol than to repair a body after a heart attack. Similarly,
we know that public health programs to reduce smoking, and deliver clean
water and food, dramatically cut disease rates. Much of the money that
flows to expanding hospital facilities would be better spent on social
or other community-based services that sustain health rather than
restore it. Third, providers, insurers and drug manufacturers need to
rein in costs by redesigning how we deliver and pay for healthcare. By
changing how, where and by whom preventive and curative care is
delivered, and by ensuring that evidence-based care is provided, we can
get better care, better outcomes and lower costs. If this is not done,
[political pressure for a single payer plan will increase]{.underline}.
Buffett, for one, likes the idea. Even if single payer is ruled out,
**[failure to control costs will likely lead to onerous new regulations
throughout the healthcare sector. When we reach a point where the
accumulated debt threatens the economy]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}**, ultimately, our **[national
security]{.underline}**, federal and state health policy will become
even more Draconian. A **[fiscal crisis could lead to blunt cuts in
healthcare funding]{.underline}**. If the system has not been
redesigned, however, we will simply be buying less from the same poorly
performing health care delivery system. Buffett put it succinctly:
"**[Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic
competitiveness]{.underline}**," he said. [It's time to extract the
tapeworm, and give Americans an affordable and sustainable healthcare
system that will not eat them from the inside out.]{.underline}

### 2AC- Environment Turn

#### Wrecks the environment\-\--causes warming, destroys the oceans and arctic

**Wilkins 19** \-\-- Mackenzie Mcdonald Wilkins, Trade For People And
Planet (\"USMCA is Another Corporate Power Grab. We Need a Real NAFTA
Replacement!,\" 2-27-2019,
http://tradeforpeopleandplanet.org/usmca-is-another-corporate-power-grab-we-need-a-real-nafta-replacement/,
accessed 7-1-2019) bm

As discussed, [USMCA lacks labor and environmental enforcement
mechanisms]{.underline}. But this is just part of the problem. [Even if
there were enforcement, the USMCA **lacks good rules** to
**enforce**]{.underline}. Further, the new NAFTA includes two ways--ISDS
and good regulatory practices--that allow corporations to change or
repeal regulations that hurt their profits. [USMCA is fundamentally
oriented towards corporations, not]{.underline} people or [the planet,
which is why it must be **stopped altogether** not simply
reformed]{.underline}. Stopping the USMCA will allow us to go back to
the drawing board. A [better
model](http://tradeforpeopleandplanet.org/alternatives-to-corporate-trade/)
for North American trade is achievable if we maintain that focus. A new
North American agreement needs strong and enforceable labor and
environmental standards. It needs to raise wages in all three countries,
support unions, repeal right-to-work laws, and end the outsourcing of
jobs and pollution. It needs to protect small and indigenous farmers,
sustainable food systems and consumers by strengthening food labeling
and inspections of imported foods. It needs to make medicine and health
care more accessible and affordable. It needs to protect wildlife, clean
air and water, and the health of our communities. It needs to address
climate change head on and defend the most vulnerable communities from
environmental disasters. Trade must be used to obtain positive goals
that reduce inequality and treat people with dignity. It must prioritize
reparations to indigenous peoples and black and brown communities
through financial compensation and decolonization and respect the
sovereignty of Indigenous Nations to control what happens on their land.
Any new 'trade' deal must be negotiated through a democratic and
transparent process that includes public participation with broad swaths
of society, not just corporations. NAFTA 2 falls far short of meeting
these basic criteria. [Dr. Margaret Flowers and Kevin Zeese
[write](http://tradeforpeopleandplanet.org/trump-trade-revealed-another-rigged-corporate-deal/),
the "new NAFTA framework remains trade for corporations while
undermining health, the environment, food, and worker
rights]{.underline}." NAFTA 2 provides [new
avenues](https://www.iatp.org/documents/new-nafta-imposes-hurdles-delay-and-weaken-public-protections)
for corporations to challenge public interest laws that hurt their
profits. [It maintains NAFTA **offshoring of jobs** and
**pollution**]{.underline} as well as buy american and buy local waivers
for Canadian and Mexican industries. [The USMCA facilitates the
expansion of **chemical agriculture** and GMOs while undermining food
safety inspections and labelling]{.underline}. [It encourages **dirty
energy** from **fracking** and **tar sands**, and fails to even mention
climate change. As the recent [IPCC
report](https://popularresistance.org/ipcc-radical-energy-transformation-needed-to-avoid-1-5-degrees-global-warming/)
shows, **we don't have 16 years** to start talking about climate
change.]{.underline} In terms of offshoring, [the current language of
USMCA allows corporations to send jobs and pollution to Mexico where
**environmental** and human rights **protections are often
lower**]{.underline}. For instance, this new NAFTA would allow metal
recyclers to send [toxic used car
batteries](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2016/02/26/a-dangerous-export-americas-car-battery-waste-is-making-mexican-communities-sick/?noredirect=on&fbclid=IwAR0fw4gOrwoMNAOBtadJWq8gM0AjoGJ8CmQ2jqos8xknaPgIKfqxFDE6xS4)
to Mexican recycling factories that do not have lead exposure controls
and where workers have and continue to get lead poisoning. The US-Mexico
border has become a [dumping
ground](https://therevelator.org/border-betrayed/) for the excessive
waste of corporate America. In terms of energy, fossil fuel companies
are major winners of the new NAFTA. Instead of moving North America
towards renewables, USMCA locks us into oil and gas. According to
[Sierra
Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/NAFTA-environment-statement.pdf)
the USMCA maintains NAFTA rules that prevent the U.S. government, the
Department of Energy, "from determining whether gas exports to Mexico or
Canada are in the public interest." [This basically is an automatic
**guarantee of gas export** which would "incr**ease fracking** in the
U.S., expand cross-border gas pipelines]{.underline}," [and create
greater Mexican dependency on natural gas which has been the **main
contributor**, way more than any other fuel type, to
Mexico's]{.underline} [[recent
increase](https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/uploads-wysiwig/NAFTA%20and%20Climate%20Report%202018.pdf)
in **climate pollution.**]{.underline} Also in Mexico, [the USMCA will
lock in the government's recent **deregulation** of **oil and
gas**]{.underline}. [Big oil successfully lobbied for two
ways]{.underline}--ISDS and good regulatory practices--to [challenge the
Mexican government if it tries to nationalize its energy sector agan.
The USMCA also [supports tar
sands](https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2018/11/opposition-trump-s-pro-polluter-nafta-deal-mounts-ahead-deal-signing)]{.underline},
though in a little different way from NAFTA.. NAFTA supported tar sands
with the proportionality rule that locks in tar sands oil extraction in
Canada. USMCA, on the other hand, supports tar sands [by making it
cheaper for oil companies to export Canadian tar sands through U.S. oil
pipelines.]{.underline} [This could make it harder to shut down existing
tar sands pipelines]{.underline} like Keystone Phase 1, Enbridge line
6b, line 5, and line 17 as well as stop new ones like the proposed
Enbridge line 3. ['USMCA's proposed expansion of the **fossil fuel
empire** is an **environmental disaster** on its own.]{.underline} But,
[NAFTA 2 goes further by **reducing environmental protections** that are
included in the last four US trade deals.]{.underline} It does this by
"[failing to reinforce a standard set of seven]{.underline} Multilateral
Environmental Agreements ([MEA]{.underline})" [that protect **wetland
ecosystems**, **arctic ecosystems**, and **endangered species** and
prevent **overfishing**, **unnecessary marine pollution**, and so much
**more**.]{.underline} An [environmental
coalition](https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/NAFTA-environment-statement.pdf)shows:
"the deal includes standard enforcement language for only one of the
seven MEAs, while using weak language for two and failing to even
mention four of these essential environmental agreements."

#### Warming causes extinction.

**Cribb 17**---principal of JCA, Fellow of the Australian Academy of
Technological Sciences and Engineering, former Director, National
Awareness, CSIRO (Julian, "The Baker," *Surviving the 21st Century*
Chapter 4, pg 91-94)

[Unlocking]{.underline} several trillion tonnes of [methane would
cause]{.underline} global [temperatures to **rocket**]{.underline}
upwards sharply. Once such a process gets under way, most experts
consider, [warming will happen **so fast** it is
**doubtful**]{.underline} if [humans could do anything]{.underline} to
stop it even if they instantly ceased all burning of fossil fuels. This
'double whammy' of global warming caused by humans releasing three
trillion tonnes of fossil carbon which then precipitates an
uncontrollable second phase driven by the melting of all or part of the
five trillion tonnes of natural methane deposits (Buff et & Archer 2004)
is the principal threat to civilisation in the twenty-first century and,
combined with nuclear conflict (Chap. 4), to the survival of the human
species. The IPCC's fifth report states that the melting of between 37
and 81 % of the world's tundra permafrost is 'virtually certain' adding
"There is a high risk of substantial carbon and methane emissions as a
result of permafrost thawing " ((IPCC 2014a), p. 74). This could involve
the venting of as much as 920 billion tonnes of carbon. However, the
Panel did not venture an estimate for methane emissions from the melting
of the far larger seabed clathrates and a number of scientists have
publicly criticised the world's leading climate body for remaining so
close-lipped about this mega-threat to human existence. The IPCC's
reticence is thought to be founded on a lack of adequate scientific data
to make a pronouncement with confidence---and partly to fear of the
mischief which the fossil fuels lobby would make of any premature
estimates. However, it critics argue, by the time we know for sure that
the Arctic and seabed methane is escaping in large volumes, it will be
too late to do anything about it. The difficulty is that no-one knows
how quickly the Earth will heat up, as this depends on something that
cannot be scientifically predicted: the behaviour of the whole human
species and the timeliness with which we act. Failure to abolish carbon
emissions in time will make a 4--5 °C rise in temperature likely. As to
what that may mean, here are some eminent opinions : • Warming of 5 °C
will mean the planet can support fewer than 1 billion
people---Hans-Joachim Shellnhuber, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact
Research (Kanter 2009) • With temperature increases of 4--7 °C
**[billions]{.underline}** of people [will have to move]{.underline} and
[there will be]{.underline} very **[severe
conflict]{.underline}**---Nicholas Stern, London School of Economics
(Kanter 2009) • Food shortages, refugee crises, flooding of major cities
and entire island nations, mass extinction of plants and animals, and a
climate so drastically altered it may be dangerous for people to work or
play outside during the hottest times of the year---IPCC Fifth
Assessment (IPCC 2014b) • Corn and soybean yields in the US may decrease
by 63--82 %---Schlenker and Roberts, Arizona State University (Schlenker
& Roberts 2009a) • Up to [**35%** of]{.underline} the Earth's [species
will be]{.underline} committed to **[extinction]{.underline}**---Chris
Thomas, University of Leeds (Thomas et al. 2004) • Total polar melting
combined with thermal expansion could involve sea levels eventually
rising by 65 m (180 ft), i.e. to the 20th floor of tall buildings,
drowning most of the world's coastal cities and displacing a third or
more of the human population (Winkelmann et al. 2015) • Intensified
global **[instability, hunger]{.underline}**, **[poverty and
conflict]{.underline}**. Food and water **[shortages]{.underline}**,
pandemic [**disease**, disputes]{.underline} over refugees and
resources, [and]{.underline} destruction by **[natural
disasters]{.underline}** in regions across the globe---Chuck Hagel, US
Secretary for Defence (Hagel 2014) • "Almost inconceivable challenges as
human society struggles to adapt... billions of people forced to
relocate.... worsening tensions especially over resources... armed
conflict is likely and [**nuclear war** is possible]{.underline}"---
Kurt Campbell, Center for Strategic and International Studies (Campell
et al. 2007). • "Unless we get control of (global warming), **[it will

University (Snow & Hannam 2014).

#### Ocean biodiversity solves extinction

**Craig '3** (Robin Kundis Craig, Professor at Florida State University
College of Law, leading environmental law scholar who has written
important works on water and ocean and coastal issues, Winter 2003,
"Taking Steps Toward Marine Wilderness Protection? Fishing and Coral
Reef Marine Reserves in Florida and Hawaii," 34 McGeorge L. Rev. 155,
Lexis)

The world's oceans contain many resources and provide many services that
humans consider valuable. "Occupying more than seventy percent of the
Earth's surface and ninety-five percent of the biosphere," oceans
provide food; marketable goods such as shells, aquarium fish, and
pharmaceuticals; life support processes, including carbon sequestration,
nutrient cycling, and weather mechanics; and quality of life, both
aesthetic and economic, for millions of people worldwide. Indeed, [it is
difficult to overstate the importance of the ocean]{.underline} to
humanity's well-being: "[The ocean is the]{.underline} cradle of life on
our planet, and it remains the axis of existence, the locus of planetary
biodiversity, and the [engine of]{.underline} the chemical and
[hydrological cycles that]{.underline} create and [maintain]{.underline}
our [atmosphere and climate]{.underline}." Ocean and coastal ecosystem
services have been calculated to be worth over twenty billion dollars
per year, worldwide. In addition, many people assign heritage and
existence value to the ocean and its creatures, viewing the world's seas
as a common legacy to be passed on relatively intact to future
generations. (It continues...) More generally, "[ocean
ecosystems]{.underline} play a major role in the global geochemical
cycling of all the elements that [represent the]{.underline} basic
[building blocks of]{.underline} living [organisms]{.underline}, carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur, as well as other less
abundant but necessary elements". In a very real and direct sense,
[therefore, **human degradation** of marine ecosystems **impairs the
planet's ability to support life**]{.underline}. Maintaining
biodiversity is often critical to maintaining the functions of marine
ecosystems[.]{.underline} Current evidence shows that, in general, [an
ecosystem's ability to]{.underline} keep [function]{.underline}ing in
the face of disturbance [is]{.underline} strongly [dependent on its
biodiversity]{.underline}, "[indicating that more diverse ecosystems are
more stable]{.underline}. Coral reef ecosystems are particularly
dependent on their biodiversity. \[\*265\] Most ecologists agree that
the complexity of interactions and degree of interrelatedness among
component species is higher on coral reefs than in any other marine
environment. This implies that the ecosystem functioning that produces
the most highly valued components is also complex and that many
otherwise insignificant species have strong effects on sustaining the
rest of the reef system. n860 Thus, maintaining and restoring the
biodiversity of marine ecosystems is critical to maintaining and
restoring the ecosystem services that they provide. Non-use biodiversity
values for marine ecosystems have been calculated in the wake of marine
disasters, like the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. n861 Similar
calculations could derive preservation values for marine wilderness.
However, economic value, or economic value equivalents, should not be
\"the sole or even primary justification for conservation of ocean
ecosystems. Ethical arguments also have considerable force and merit.\"
n862 At the forefront of such arguments should be a recognition of how
little we know about the sea - and about the actual effect of human
activities on marine ecosystems. The United States has traditionally
failed to protect marine ecosystems because it was difficult to detect
anthropogenic harm to the oceans, but we now know that such harm is
occurring - even though we are not completely sure about causation or
about how to fix every problem. Ecosystems like the NWHI coral reef
ecosystem should inspire lawmakers and policymakers to admit that most
of the time we really do not know what we are doing to the sea and hence
should be preserving marine wilderness whenever we can - especially when
the United States has within its territory relatively pristine marine
ecosystems that may be unique in the world.We may not know much about
the sea, but we do know this much: [**If we kill the ocean we kill
ourselves, and** we]{.underline} will [take most of **the biosphere**
with us]{.underline}.

[The Arctic ecosystem is]{.underline} a **[fundamental]{.underline}**
contributor [to **global processes** and]{.underline} the balance of
**[life on earth]{.underline}**. Both the [unique]{.underline} physical
and biological [characteristics]{.underline} of the Arctic ecosystem
[play key roles in maintaining]{.underline} the integrity of [the
**global environment**]{.underline}. Massive [ice sheets]{.underline}
and ice cover [regulate]{.underline} the [global
temperatures]{.underline} by reflecting much of the solar radiation back
into space, the Arctic ocean influences global ocean currents which are
responsible for a variety of weather conditions and events, to name but
two. The Arctic is also the recipient of the by-products of
southern-based industry and agricultural practices. In February 2003,
UNEP's Governing Council passed [a resolution effectively recognizes the
Arctic as a "**barometer**" or **indicator region** of the **globe's
environmental health**.]{.underline} This is important and is further
reason why Arctic indigenous peoples should work together at the
international level. Late last year ICC and RAIPON participated in the
Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council meeting in Beijing, China with
the aim of sensitizing this organization to the Arctic dimension of
global environmental issues. I understand that the GEF is now willing to
consider indigenous peoples and their organizations to be distinct and
separate from environmental and other NGO's.

thrive]{.underline}.[142](https://tnsr.org/2018/02/choosing-primacy-u-s-strategy-global-order-dawn-post-cold-war-era-2/#_ftn142)
Other scholars have noted the role of America's post-Cold War policies
in assisting the continued spread of democracy and market institutions,
and in limiting nuclear proliferation in East Asia and Eastern
Europe.[143](https://tnsr.org/2018/02/choosing-primacy-u-s-strategy-global-order-dawn-post-cold-war-era-2/#_ftn143)
Not least, [even consistent critics of America's]{.underline} post-Cold
War [strategy]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} John
[Mearsheimer]{.underline}, [have acknowledged that a persistent U.S.
presence in key regions such as]{.underline} Europe and **[East
Asia]{.underline}** [helped to avoid the **major interstate wars**
that]{.underline} characterized many earlier historical eras, [and to
avert a rapid return to the more unstable and violent climate that
many]{.underline} observers [feared when the Cold War
ended]{.underline}.[144](https://tnsr.org/2018/02/choosing-primacy-u-s-strategy-global-order-dawn-post-cold-war-era-2/#_ftn144)
All of these points could, surely, be debated at length. Yet [if a key
premise of a primacist strategy was that **assertive American
engagement** would help produce a **more stable** and **liberal
international order** than]{.underline} one might
[otherwise]{.underline} have [expected, then there is a defensible
argument to be made that this premise, too, **looks fairly good**
twenty-five years later.]{.underline} A primacist strategy has never
been without its problems, from the economic costs associated with a
global military presence to the fact that the United States has
periodically succumbed to the temptation to overuse its tremendous
power. Today, moreover, [the United States faces]{.underline} more
[serious challenges to its primacy]{.underline} and global interests
[than at any other time in the post-Cold War era]{.underline}, [from a
**rising China**]{.underline}, a resurgent Russia, and an international
rogues' gallery that is more empowered and better armed than at any
moment since Saddam Hussein's defeat in 1991. Not least, there is some
uncertainty as to whether American leaders and the body politic still
support such an engaged and assertive strategy, and the policies and
mannerisms of the Trump administration may well pose their own challenge
to U.S. effectiveness and leadership on the global
stage.[145](https://tnsr.org/2018/02/choosing-primacy-u-s-strategy-global-order-dawn-post-cold-war-era-2/#_ftn145)
[Yet when one considers the more **constructive effects** that a
**primacist strategy** has]{.underline} arguably [had]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the fact [that some of its **foundational premises**
have **proven fairly solid** over time,]{.underline} [one
does,]{.underline} perhaps, [gain a greater degree of appreciation for
the logic of America's post-Cold War strategy]{.underline}, and for the
Bush administration's role in shaping that strategy at a moment of great
promise and uncertainty in international affairs.

#### USMCA is CATASTROPHIC for warming\-\--[deregulates]{.underline} ag and entrenches fossil fuel dependence

[Free trade agreements]{.underline}, [like the]{.underline} 25-year-old
[North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), have been a major driver
of climate change]{.underline}. Through legally-binding rules, [these
deals have favored **high greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting and extractive
industries, like energy and agriculture, over environmental
protection**]{.underline}. The Trump administration's rebranded NAFTA,
called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (**[USMCA]{.underline}**),
[repeats past mistakes by ignoring climate change, disregarding the
pact's **impact on GHG emissions** and **failing to consider how climate
change will affect the three countries into the future**]{.underline}.
The deal stands in stark contrast to the warning in the latest
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that "rapid,
far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society" are
needed to avoid the severe and costly impacts of climate change.1 The
new NAFTA represents a lost opportunity to fundamentally reconsider
trade deals in the context of climate change. The role of trade
agreements in driving climate change has taken on new importance. Recent
research estimated that [**25 percent of global GHG pollution** is from
operations that have been off-shored]{.underline}, [with]{.underline}
the products then imported.2 The U.S. is the number one importer of
products with embedded emissions. [The new NAFTA further]{.underline}
[integrates]{.underline} a North American market for [**fossil-fuel
intensive sectors** like **agriculture**, **forestry** and **energy
itself**]{.underline}. In doing so, the new NAFTA charts a dangerous
path forward, **[accelerating climate change]{.underline}**.
Specifically, the [new NAFTA empowers energy]{.underline} [companies to
legally **challenge environmental protections**]{.underline}, [creates
new venues for]{.underline} [governments]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[weaken]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} [**block** environmental
regulations]{.underline}, and facilitates a North American system of
energy, fuel and agriculture that are major sources of GHG emissions.
Here are a few areas of particular concern: Protecting the fossil fuel
industry O[ne of the most highly criticized provisions of NAFTA is the
Investor State Dispute System]{.underline} (ISDS). Under ISDS, [private
corporations can sue governments if they believe a new government policy
treats them unfairly]{.underline}. [Fossil fuel companies have used ISDS
numerous times]{.underline} to sue governments over environmental
protections critical to protect the climate.3 In a step forward, the new
NAFTA phases out ISDS between the U.S. and Canada over three years. But
the existing ISDS will remain in place in U.S.-Mexico relations for the
oil, gas and energy industries, infrastructure, transportation, and
telecommunications sectors. For other sectors, ISDS could be used on a
more limited basis by corporations based in the U.S. or Mexico to
challenge domestic policies unfavorable to the industry. As the Sierra
Club points out,4 "That means, for example, that [Chevron]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [ExxonMobil]{.underline}---the two largest corporate
climate polluters in history and repeat users of
ISDS---[would]{.underline} [be allowed to challenge environmental
protections in Mexico]{.underline} by relying on the same broad
corporate rights that they have used to successfully challenge public
interest policies from Ecuador to Canada." Maintaining ISDS between the
U.S. and Mexico was [a **major win for the oil industry**]{.underline}.5
After 77 years under state ownership, Mexico amended its constitution in
2013 to open its oil and gas reserves to private investment. U.S.-based
energy companies are jumping to invest in Mexico's natural gas
reserves,6 while the two countries explore cross-border electric
transmission projects.7 [A new NAFTA]{.underline} annex on energy
regulatory measures between the U.S. and Canada makes clear the goal is
to [support]{.underline} "North American [energy market
integration]{.underline}," with non-discriminatory access to pipelines
and other electric transmission facilities.8 It's worth noting a
positive step for the climate: New NAFTA does away with the
Proportionality Clause. The highly controversial clause required Canada
(and only Canada) to export a portion of its oil to the U.S.
indefinitely.9 The clause has been linked to the development of the
highly polluting Tar Sands and its elimination should have long-term
benefits for Canada in reducing its GHG emissions. Expanding high GHG
emitting industrial agriculture The original NAFTA largely eliminated
tariffs between the three countries in the trade of agricultural goods.
There were exceptions, including the Canadian dairy, poultry and egg
supply management programs and the U.S. sugar program. The new NAFTA
whittles away at supply management programs in Canada that protect
dairy, poultry and egg producers.10 Canada will allow marginal new
access for U.S. dairy products, while equivalent U.S. access will be
given for Canadian dairy imports. Canada will also provide new access
for U.S. chicken, turkey and eggs. Canada's supply management programs
remain, but are noticeably weaker. (See "'New NAFTA' puts the brakes on
farm policy reforms" for more detail) [The agriculture sector is the
fifth-highest source of GHGs]{.underline} in the U.S., according to the
EPA.11 The primary sources of agriculture emissions are [linked to
large-scale industrial]{.underline} [operations]{.underline}---[the
heavy use of synthetic fertilizers]{.underline} (linked to the GHG
nitrous oxide12) particularly for corn, [and]{.underline} **[methane
emissions associated with livestock]{.underline}** ([mostly
from]{.underline} confined animal feeding operations or
[CAFOs]{.underline}13). California has identified methane emissions from
their giant dairy CAFOs as an important target for the state's climate
mitigation strategy.14 [NAFTA]{.underline}, coupled with the U.S. Farm
Bill, [has played a major role in expanding the CAFO model of
production]{.underline} for pork, poultry, beef and dairy [in all three
countries]{.underline}---where animals often cross borders during their
lifetime as part of an increasingly integrated, tri-national system.15
The Trump administration ignored calls from family farm groups to
include mandatory Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) for meat in new
NAFTA to help consumers support local markets, after Mexico and Canada
had successfully challenged COOL at the World Trade Organization. Recent
research has documented the role of global meat and dairy companies as
major contributors to climate change.16 [The erosion of agricultural
supply]{.underline} [management programs in new NAFTA is a setback for a
**critically important climate strategy**.]{.underline} Supply
management programs reduce GHGs by effectively limiting production,
including on environmentally sensitive land. Supply management programs
that place food grains in reserve are also an important adaptation tool
in years of climate disruption.17 **[Deregulatory
harmonization]{.underline}** The new NAFTA includes a broad and novel
chapter on Good Regulatory Practices.18 The GRP chapter, along with
regulatory provisions in other chapters, consists of a complex,
bureaucratic and confusing web of rules restricting how domestic
regulators research, draft and implement public policies. For the first
time in a U.S. free trade agreement, a chapter that focuses on
regulations broadly will include a dispute settlement
provision---meaning it is legally enforceable. These provisions have no
precedent in the original NAFTA, which contained only limited and
completely voluntary regulatory transparency measures. Under the
chapter, countries will be required to report publicly on regulations
under consideration for the following year and provide justification and
pre-implementation impact assessments. The intended result is to
harmonize state, federal, and international regulations and standards.
The practical result, though, is that corporate interests can head off
proposed regulations, even if such measures are designed specifically to
meet climate goals. Weakening environmental protections [The new NAFTA
Environment Chapter is **considerably weaker than the
original**]{.underline}.19 In 2007, Congress reached a bipartisan
agreement20 to include obligations to seven multilateral environmental
agreements in future Free Trade Agreements: The Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), Montreal Protocol on
Ozone Depleting Substances, Convention on Marine Pollution,
InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Convention (IATTC), Ramsar Convention on
Wetlands, International Whaling Convention (IWC), and Convention on
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The new
NAFTA includes only three of those treaties (Montreal Protocol, Marine
Pollution and CITES). Of those three, it weakens the commitment for two
of them, making it generally unenforceable. One of the main criticisms
of trade agreements has been the lack of enforceable environmental
commitments. The new NAFTA contains no substantive changes in this
regard. The Trump administration has yet to conduct an Environmental
Review of the new NAFTA as has been done with recent U.S. free trade
agreements.21 Reinforcing a climate vulnerable agricultural system
Maintaining genetic diversity in crop and animal production is essential
for adapting to climate change, according to a recent report by the UN
Food and Agriculture Organization.22 Climate adaptation strategies
identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture contain practices that
strengthen soil health and include more perennial and diverse systems.
These same systems have the added benefit of producing less GHGs. Less
diversity and more homogeneity results in agricultural systems
vulnerable to extreme weather and new pests and weeds, all of which are
expected outcomes of climate change. Rather than supporting strategies
to build climate resilience in agriculture, the new NAFTA requires all
participating countries to sign on to a global seed breeders' rights
treaty (known as UPOV91), which prohibits farmers and breeders from
exchanging established seeds.23 (See "'New NAFTA' puts the brakes on
farm policy reforms" for more detail). In addition, it includes new
rules covering patented genetically engineered crops at the behest of
the biotech industry. GE crops, primarily used for monocultural
commodity crop production, have played an integral role in expanding the
high GHG model of agricultural production in the U.S. and Canada. The
USTR boasts that the new NAFTA is superior to the Trans-Pacific
Partnership when it comes to advancing agriculture biotechnology,
including for the first time new technologies like gene editing.24 The
new rules will make it difficult for Mexico and Canada to block imports
of GMO and gene-edited crops approved for use in the U.S., but not in
those countries. (See "Entrenching the non-regulation of food and
agricultural products of "modern biotechnology" in the USCMA" for more
detail) Increasing food safety risks Climate change is expected to
increase risks related to food safety and plant and animal health due to
variances of temperatures and the spread of animal and plant diseases.25
Under new NAFTA, countries would be given new powers to challenge food
safety inspectors who stopped food shipments, and require a quick review
of the action. Equivalency elements in the agreement establish that food
safety systems and inspections are the same in all three
countries---thereby reducing the need for food safety inspections at the
border. A major concern is the inability of governments, including the
U.S., to fully fund enforcement of existing food safety rules. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration has conducted less than one-third of the
inspections of foreign facilities exporting into the U.S. as required
under the current national food safety law, partially due to a lack of
funding.26 (For more, see Food safety and agricultural biotechnology in
USMCA: the anti-science Trump administration negotiates rules based on
"scientific principles") Undermining the Paris Climate Agreement At the
heart of the Paris Climate Agreement are national-level plans to reduce
GHG emissions.27 Within each plan are goals, policies and strategies to
reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate change. Both Mexico and Canada
are part of, and remain committed to, the United Nations' Paris Climate
agreement. And while the Trump administration has signaled it will
withdraw from the Accord, at least nine U.S. states and 125 U.S. cities
have expressed their commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. Each
country, along with sub-federal governments, will need policy
flexibility to meet their climate goals. New climate policies like
carbon markets, carbon taxes, carbon tariffs, emission regulations and
renewable energy programs could come into conflict with new NAFTA's
various deregulatory rules. Conclusion The Trump administration's
attacks on climate action have been numerous. From the announcement to
withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, to attempts to kill the Clean
Power Plan,28 to the steady removal of scientific expertise from
government agencies29---the administration's assault on environmental
protections has been unrelenting. [The new NAFTA represents a critical
opportunity to ensure that trade policy does not conflict with policies
or inhibit investments to reduce greenhouse gases and adapt to climate
change]{.underline}. [Instead of setting a new bar and]{.underline}
**[integrating climate goals within a trade deal]{.underline}**, [the
Trump administration has **done the opposite**]{.underline}, [not only
setting the U.S. back, but also Canada and Mexico, in efforts to address
climate change.]{.underline} [**NAFTA has helped drive GHG emissions**
for the last 25 years. **The climate can't afford to continue this
damaging legacy under the new NAFTA.**]{.underline}
