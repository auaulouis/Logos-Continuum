#### New arms sales enflame US-China tensions in the Taiwan strait- China is primed to invade Taiwan

Since then, **[U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, totaling more than \$25
billion between 2007 and 2018, have led to [U.S.-China friction and an
upsurge in bellicose rhetoric across the strait]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[Political transitions in the United States have also prompted
tensions between Beijing and Washington. Taiwan's Tsai spoke with U.S.
President Donald J. Trump by telephone ahead of his inauguration, the
first such high-level contact between the two sides since 1979. [The
Trump administration]{.mark} also seems to be [deepening ties with
Taiwan over Chinese objections, proposing multiple arms deals and
unveiling a new \$250 million complex for its de facto embassy in
Taipei]{.mark}. [China]{.mark}, as part of its continued military
expansion[, has deployed missiles along the Taiwan Strait and
periodically conducts drills near the island]{.mark}. It has sent
bombers, fighter jets, and its aircraft carrier over and around the
strait as shows of force.]{.underline}** According to a 2018 [U.S.
Department of Defense
report](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Aug/16/2001955282/-1/-1/1/2018-CHINA-MILITARY-POWER-REPORT.PDF),
**[[China]{.mark}'s military]{.underline}**, the People's Liberation
Army, **[[has "continued to develop and deploy increasingly advanced
military capabilities intended to coerce Taiwan]{.mark}, signal Chinese
resolve, and gradually improve capabilities for an invasion." Beijing
has refused to renounce the use of force to resolve disputes over the
island's status.]{.underline}** The PRC's introduction of the [2005
Anti-Secession
Law](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4347555.stm), intended to
strengthen Beijing's approach to "peaceful national reunification,"
included language stating that in the event secessionist forces seek
independence, Beijing would "employ non-peaceful means" to protect its
national sovereignty. In a [2019
speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/world/asia/xi-jinping-taiwan-china.html),
Xi reiterated this and added that Beijing would consider the use of
force to prevent "intervention by external forces" on the island. **[In
response, Taiwan continues to purchase weapons, primarily from the
United States.]{.underline}** Between 1979 and 2018, **[Taiwan ranked as
the ninth largest recipient of arms globally.]{.underline}** During the
same period, the United States supplied more than three-quarters of
Taiwan's imported weapons, according to the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute's [arms transfers
database](http://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers). **[Taiwan's
strategic security rests heavily on guarantees offered by the United
States under the Taiwan Relations Act.]{.underline}** Yet in recent
years, security analysts have cited concern over the emerging military
imbalance between Beijing and Taipei. "Given the pace of PLA(N)
\[People's Liberation Army Navy\] modernization, the [gap in military
capability](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL33153.pdf) between the
mainland and Taiwan will continue to widen in China's favor over the
coming years," writes the Congressional Research Services' naval affairs
specialist Ronald O'Rourke.

#### Official statements prove -- Chinese commitments to attack over Taiwan

**[AP 7/13]{.underline}** Associated Press, 7-13-2019, \"Taiwan defends
U.S. arms deal after China sanctions threat,\" NBC News,

[TAIPEI, Taiwan --- [Taiwan]{.mark} on Saturday [defended a proposal to
purchase \$2.2 billion in arms from the U.S.]{.mark}, [following a
Chinese announcement that it would sanction any American companies
involved in the deal.]{.mark}]{.underline}

U.S. weapons help strengthen Taiwan\'s self-defense in the face of a
growing military threat from China, the defense ministry said.

\"The national army will continue to strengthen its key defense forces,
ensure national security, protect its homeland and ensure that the
fruits of freedom and democracy won\'t be attacked,\" the ministry said
in a statement.

China announced late Friday that it would impose sanctions on any U.S.
enterprises involved in the deal, saying it \"undermines China\'s
sovereignty and national security.\"

Taiwan split from China during a civil war in 1949, but the mainland
still considers the self-governing island as part of its territory.

[China has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under
its control.]{.underline}

**[On a visit to Budapest on Friday, [China\'s top diplomat Wang Yi
warned Washington it should \"not play with fire\" on the question of
Taiwan.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[The U.S., which recognized Beijing as the government of China in 1979,
does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan,]{.underline} but U.S.
law requires that it provide Taiwan with sufficient defense equipment
and services for self-defense.

The Trump administration announced the proposed \$2.2 billion sale,
which would include 108 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger surface-to-air
missiles, earlier in the week.

Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, speaking in New York on Friday, said
that her government has strengthened Taiwan\'s national defense to
protect its democracy, according to a transcript posted on the
presidential office website.

China has objected to her U.S. visit, which Taiwan calls a \"two-evening
transit stop\" on the way to Haiti and three other Caribbean nations
that recognize Taiwan.

**[[\"We urge the U.S. to abide by the \'One China\' principle]{.mark}
and \... no[t allow Tsai Ing-wen\'s stopover, cease official exchanges
with Taiwan and refrain from providing any platform for separatist
Taiwan independence forces,\"]{.mark} foreign ministry spokesman Geng
Shuang said Friday in Beiijng.]{.underline}**

Tsai dismissed Chinese criticism of both her visit and the arms deal.
\"We don\'t need our neighbor to make irresponsible remarks,\" she told
reporters in New York, according to Taiwan\'s official Central News
Agency.

[She has rejected Chinese pressure to reunite Taiwan and China under the
\"one-country, two-systems\" framework that governs Hong Kong. She said
Friday that the people of Taiwan stand with the young people of Hong
Kong who are fighting for democratic freedoms in ongoing
protests.]{.underline}

\"Hong Kong\'s experience under \'one country, two systems\' has shown
the world once and for all that authoritarianism and democracy cannot
coexist,\" she said.

####  Most likely scenario for lashout is Taiwan

that **[["war preparations]{.underline}]{.mark}**" should **[[be a top
priority for the year]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The following day,
President Xi Jinping offered a forceful reminder of what Beijing
considers its most likely focus of conflict to be: Taiwan. **[China's
rulers have long regarded the island as a rogue province]{.underline}**,
with regaining control a point of honor for the ruling Communist Party
and military alike. In a major speech on Wednesday, Xi [warned the
"problem](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan/chinas-xi-threatens-taiwan-with-force-but-also-seeks-peaceful-reunification-idUSKCN1OW04K)"
could not be held over for another generation. While he talked primarily
of "peaceful unification," he said Beijing reserves the right to use
force if necessary. The speech brought [a sharp rebuke from
Taiwan](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/world/asia/xhina-xi-jinping-taiwan.html),
where residents remain strongly opposed to rejoining China, even under a
Hong Kong-style "one country, two systems" deal. Nothing in
**[[[Xi's]{.mark}
speech](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/world/asia/xi-jinping-taiwan-china.html?module=inline)
[suggested China sees conflict as imminent]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
However, **[Xi's comments about support for peaceful ["reunification"
included a warning that "we do not promise to renounce the use of force
and reserve the option to use all necessary measures" to prevent
Taiwan's independence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Ultimately, **[if Beijing
truly wishes to reassert control over the island, military force may be
its only option]{.underline}**. That would be a risky step for a
government that has not fought a war against a foreign state since a
brief and unsuccessful conflict with Vietnam in 1979. It would also put
Beijing on a collision course with Washington, which does not support
Taiwan's independence but has what the U.S. State Department describes
as ["a robust unofficial
relationship"](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/35855.htm) with
**[Taipei. To invade the island successfully, [most military analysts
argue](http://www.atimes.com/article/researcher-china-still-no-match-for-us-in-fight-for-taiwan/)
[that Beijing would either have to deter the United States from
intervening or defeat nearby U.S. forces and prevent others from
entering the region]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} China may not yet
be strong enough to do this, but its military enlargement means that
[may not always be the
case](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/report-china-aims-defeat-us-war-37792).
**[Certainly, [[Chinese military
thinking](https://thediplomat.com/2018/04/is-the-western-pacific-heading-towards-an-amphibious-arms-race/)
increasingly revolves around just this kind of potential war, in which
Beijing would want to grab territory while keeping U.S. forces
back]{.mark}. Much of China's military buildup has been based around
ships, aircraft, and arms systems that appear suited for the type of
conflict needed to take Taiwan]{.underline}**. As well as landing ships
to carry assault troops, that includes a focus on missiles designed to
[destroy U.S. aircraft
carriers](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3609530) -- or prompting
Washington to keep out of range of the conflict. How well those weapons
would work is another question, but **[they would be central to any
conflict over Taiwan or disputed islands elsewhere in the South China
Sea. To an extent, much of this is grandstanding geopolitical
ballet]{.underline}**. Beijing has been unable to stop Taiwan from
acting as a de facto country [over the last half
century](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538), **[but remains
desperate to prevent the island from making an outright declaration of
independenc]{.underline}**e. To an extent, this posturing -- like
Beijing's [increasing military
assertiveness](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2176118/beijing-steps-naval-patrols-taiwan-strait)
with warships and jets around Taiwan -- is about reminding those in
power in Taipei that any vote on independence might bring war. But
there's more to it than that. As China asserts itself as a global power,
[Beijing wants to show the world that it is strong enough to take Taiwan
at any point it wants.]{.underline} Domestic Taiwanese politics also
remain a factor. In the run-up to Taiwan's November elections, Taiwanese
officials [accused
China](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/news-rattles-taiwan-elections-181123005140173.html)
of a Russia-style messaging campaign to undermine support for President
Tsai Ing-wen's pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party(DPP). Those
elections saw a [serious setback for the
DPP](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-china/taiwan-president-says-status-quo-policy-on-china-wont-change-after-election-drubbing-idUSKCN1NZ0D5)
and a strong performance by the pro-Chinese Kuomintang opposition, but
Xi's comments last week suggest Beijing still sees military posturing as
the best way of pressuring the island. Taking Taiwan militarily would
not be a simple operation. Chinese forces would face sophisticated
Taiwanese missile, mine, submarine and air attack if they tried to cross
the 110-mile (180 km) Taiwan Strait. The island's highly populated
cities and densely forested mountains would prove a guerrilla fighter's
paradise. A botched Taiwan invasion, potentially with tens of thousands
of casualties, could prove an international humiliation as well as
kickstarting a domestic political crisis for Xi. Taiwan, for its part,
clearly wishes to persuade China that it is not an easy target. Taipei
[intends to
spend](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/08/06/asia-pacific/taiwans-tsai-ing-wen-seeks-11-billion-defence-budget-china-threat-grows/#.XC_IpVX7TIU)
\$11 billion on defense this year, a six percent increase from 2018.
Much of that will be spent on cutting-edge U.S. and Taiwan-made
equipment -- on Jan. 2, Taipei [unveiled its

domestically-built anti-ship missile, capable of inflicting serious
casualties on any Chinese invasion force. For Washington and Beijing
alike, most of the military posturing for now is likely to remain
limited to the Taiwan Strait. Last year, the U.S. Navy [sent several
ships](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-taiwan-military/two-u-s-navy-ships-pass-through-taiwan-strait-opposing-china-idUSKCN1NX2NF)
through the Strait in what a U.S. Pacific Fleet statement described as a
demonstration of the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.
[In
1996](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/asia_pac/04/taiwan_flashpoint/html/us_role.stm),
President Bill Clinton sent two U.S. aircraft carriers -- a much more
potent force -- through the same route during [a crisis with
China](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1998/06/21/us-and-china-nearly-came-to-blows-in-96/926d105f-1fd8-404c-9995-90984f86a613/?utm_term=.e204378dc533);
some argue Washington should [again take similar
action](https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/will-the-trump-administration-send-a-us-aircraft-carrier-through-the-taiwan-strait/).
That would outrage Beijing -- no U.S. carrier has sailed through in more
than a decade, although China's aircraft carrier has [sailed the same
waters](https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/china-sends-aircraft-carrier-through-taiwan-strait/)
in its own show of force. China may be reaching for the moon, but Xi's
speech was a reminder that its greatest territorial ambitions may lie
much closer to home. Even if Beijing isn't on the verge of attacking the
island, his rhetoric raises the risk that there may eventually be
outright war. **[[In a world where the risk of conflict between major
nations seems to ratchet higher every year, China's desire to dominate
Taiwan may yet be what lights the spark.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Politics Any conflict between China and Taiwan
wil]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[l]{.underline}** almost **[[certainly
involve America]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The U.S. government does not
recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan and regards the island\'s
sovereign status as unresolved. Moreover, [the White House is legally
obligated by the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) to]{.underline} provide
defensive arms and services to Taiwan, and to maintain the U.S.
military\'s capacity to respond to any Chinese use of force against the
island. Should China seek to blockade, bomb and invade Taiwan, the
United States would be compelled to help its democratic friend. While
not as binding as a mutual defense treaty, [the TRA (U.S. Public Law
96-8) makes it clear that Washington is]{.underline} likely [to
intervene if China uses force]{.underline}. In addition to being a
matter of principle and honor, the United States needs Taiwan for
geostrategic reasons. It has become increasingly clear to American
strategists that China has embarked on a long and intense competition
for dominance over the Indo-Pacific. Taiwan is at the geographic and
political heart of this competition. **[Maritime tensions in the East
China Sea and the South China Sea]{.underline}**, while serious, pale in
comparison to this flashpoint. Separated by the Taiwan Strait for
sixty-eight years and counting, China and Taiwan each exercise authority
only over the territory under their respective control. Neither is
subordinate to the other, and neither recognizes the legality of the
other. From the perspective of Beijing, the Chinese Civil War never
ended. As a result, the two governments have no official relationship
and are still ideologically and militarily hostile. China\'s desire to
annex Taiwan keeps cross-Strait relations perpetually strained.
Rationalizing Aggression While acknowledging the huge risks entailed,
Chinese military writings use many arguments to justify the invasion of
Taiwan. They point out that critical geostrategic issues are at stake.
Internal PLA materials argue that Taiwan sits in a controlling position
along China\'s eastern seaboard, making it a gateway to the Western
Pacific and the Indian Ocean. They assert that since the great majority
of China's shipping traffic passes through the Strait, it is a vital
area affecting the security of their coastline, national economic
growth, and future prosperity. The Course Book on the Taiwan Strait\'s
Military Geography is a restricted-access PLA manual, used to teach
senior officer seminars in Beijing. It warns readers that an external
military might one day use Taiwan to cut-off China's trade lines,
hinting that the island could be used as a military base by the United
States to blockade China and undermine its rapid rise to great power
status. On this basis, the manual argues that physical control over the
island is vital for safeguarding against foreign blockades. China's
seaborne oil imports, which pass through the Strait, are highly
vulnerable, "so protecting the security of this strategic maritime
passageway is not just a military activity alone, but rather an act of
national strategy." This source then goes a step further, telling
readers that Taiwan is a chokepoint of great utility for blockading
Japan. The Taiwan Strait, it notes, is a Japanese maritime lifeline that
runs from Europe and the Middle East, and based on PLA studies, [**Japan
receives 90 percent of its oil imports, 99 percent of its mineral
resources and 100 percent of its nuclear fuel needs from ships that
travel across these sea lanes. In total, [500 million tons of Japanese
imports pass by Taiwanese waters each year]{.mark}, with 80 percent of
all Japan's container ships traveling right through the Strait, the
equivalent of one Japanese cargo ship every ten minutes. Consequently,
these waters will, "directly affect Japan's life or
deat**h]{.underline}, its survival or demise." PLA intentions and plans
for a conquered Taiwan are made plain in another internal document, The
Japanese Air Self Defense Force, a handbook studied by mid-career
officers at the PLA Air Force Command College in Beijing. The stated
purpose of the text is to help Chinese pilots and staff officers
understand the strengths and weaknesses of their Japanese adversaries.
Buried amidst hundreds of pages of detailed maps, target coordinates,
organizational charts, weapons data and jet fighter images are the
following lines: As soon as Taiwan is reunified with Mainland China,
Japan\'s maritime lines of communication will fall completely within the
striking ranges of China\'s fighters and bombers\...Our analysis shows
that, by using blockades, if we can reduce Japan\'s raw imports by
15-20%, it will be a heavy blow to Japan\'s economy\...After imports
have been reduced by 50%, even if they use rationing to limit
consumption, [**Japan\'s national economy and war-making**]{.underline}
potential [will collapse entirely]{.underline}\...[blockades can cause
sea shipments to decrease and]{.underline} can even [create a famine
within the Japanese islands.]{.underline} [These writings illustrate the
immense value placed upon Taiwan]{.underline} by the PLA, and they
clearly articulate strategic rationales for invading the island and
turning it into an \"unsinkable aircraft carrier.\" They are quick to
point out that Taiwan's location in the center of the First Island Chain
means that once it falls under Chinese control, the PLA Navy will have
assured access to the Pacific and tremendous leverage over neighboring
states, giving them command over the world's most important waters. The
PRC, then, has compelling political, economic and military reasons to
want to control Taiwan. In the eyes of Chinese strategists, this
island\'s importance is unparalleled. For historical and practical
reasons, the PLA assumes that it will have the leading role in the
campaign. [Military theorists in the PLA write that, sooner or later,
the attack will be ordered and the island invaded and turned into a
giant base for projecting China\'s strength and prestige across the
region.]{.underline} They envision a world in which Chinese troops,
planes and ships stand watch over this chokepoint, controlling all its
activities. [They contemplate a future where China dominates the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. To reach this future vision, PLA writings
assert the Chinese military must master all domains of warfare. Books
such as the Science of Military Strategy and Science of Campaigns
indicate that units assaulting Taiwan will have to be capable of
amphibious assault, maneuver, indirect fires, urban warfare and mountain
warfare. [The field manual, Informatized Army Operations]{.underline},
written by a team of officers at the PLA Nanjing Army Command Academy,
[indicates that it would be **an ugly, brutal and bloody fight. Surprise
attacks would first have to be executed to clear the way for the army to
cross the Strait. [Operations would include everything from ballistic
missile attacks to drone strikes, from cyber infiltration to space
warfare, and from commando raids to psychological
operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, at its core, the invasion of
Taiwan would be about putting boots on the ground and tanks in the
streets on Taipei. In the words of the PLA field manual, "We must
annihilate our (Taiwanese) enemies in large numbers, then conquer and
control the entire island." Looking Ahead AdGiven the gravity of the
threat facing Taiwan, it is important that the international community
understands China\'s intentions and plans. Americans need to understand
why their country might one day find itself locked in deadly embrace
with China over this island nation, and allies need to know what parts
they might be asked to play. **[If a [war]{.mark} breaks out [between
the United States and China over Taiwan,]{.mark} it [will change the
course of history and produce after effects that reverberate for
generations to come]{.mark}]{.underline}**. No one can know with any
certainty how such a war would start, how it would play out, and what
would follow it. But we can and should do more to understand the drivers
of conflict and the assumptions that underpin military plans and
preparations for it. No other flashpoint is as potentially dangerous to
the national security of the United States. It is clearly in the
American interest to develop a nuanced understanding of the threat China
poses to Taiwan, and to cultivate a strategy that takes this into
account. Indeed, it is often the case that only by thinking tragically
can tragedy be avoided. It is also true that in the absence of
understanding many will buy into Chinese propaganda. Going forward,
American policymakers need to realize that [North Korea is not the only
threat to peace in Asia]{.underline}, nor is it the worst. **[[China is
planning to invade a pro-American democracy at the center of the first
island chain, something likely to spark World War
III]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In light of this reality, the sooner the
U.S. Navy begins port calls and exercises with Taiwan the better.

Sea]{.underline}**, **[fueling Washington\'s fears that Chinese
expansionism will threaten U.S. allies and influence in the region. U.S.
destroyers have transited the Taiwan Strait, to loud protests from
Beijing]{.underline}**. American policymakers have wondered aloud
**[whether they should send an aircraft carrier through the strait as
well. [Chinese fighter jets have intercepted U.S. aircraft in the skies
above the South China Se]{.mark}]{.underline}**[a]{.mark}. Meanwhile,
U.S. President Donald **[Trump has brought long-simmering economic
disputes to a rolling boil.]{.underline}** A war between the two
countries remains unlikely, but **[the prospect of a [military
confrontation-]{.mark} resulting, for example[, from a Chinese campaign
against Taiwan-no longer seems as implausible]{.mark}]{.underline}**. as
it once did. And the odds of **[[such a confrontation going nuclear are
higher than most policymakers and analysts think]{.mark}. Members of
Chinas strategic community tend to dismiss such concerns. Likewise, U.S.
studies of a potential war with China often exclude nuclear weapons from
the analysis entirely,]{.underline}** treating them as basically
irrelevant to the course of a conflict. Asked about the issue in 2015,
Dennis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific,
estimated the likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as \"somewhere
between nil and zero.\" This assurance is misguided. If deployed against
China, the [**[Pentagon\'s preferred style of conventional warfare would
be a potential recipe for nuclear escalation]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
Since the end of the Cold War, the United States\' signature approach to
war has been simple: punch deep into enemy territory in order to rapidly
knock out the opponent\'s key military assets at minimal cost. But the
Pentagon developed this formula in wars against Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya, and Serbia, none of which was a nuclear power. **[[China,]{.mark}
by contrast[, not only has nuclear weapons]{.mark}; [it has also
intermingled them with its conventional military forces, making it
difficult to attack one without attacking the
other]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This means **[that a major U.S. military
campaign targeting China\'s conventional forces would likely also
threaten its nuclear arsenal.]{.underline}** Faced with such a threat,
**[[Chinese leaders could decide to use their nuclear weapons while they
were still able to.]{.mark} As U.S. and Chinese leaders navigate a
relationship fraught with mutual suspicion, [they must come to grips
with the fact that a conventional war could skid into a nuclear
confrontation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Although this risk is not high in
absolute terms, **[its [consequences for the region and the world would
be devastating]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As long as the **[[United States
and China continue to pursue their current grand strategies, the risk is
likely to endure]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This means that leaders on both
sides should dispense with the illusion that they can easily fight a
limited war. **[They should focus instead on managing or resolving the
political, economic, and military tensions that might lead to a conflict
in the first place.]{.underline}**

## Advantage 2 is Relations

### Scenario 1 is North Korea

#### North Korean prolif now -- they'll have 100 nuclear warheads by 2020

Interest, 4-11-2019, \"Imagine This: North Korea with 100 Nuclear
Warheads,\" National Interest,

For its report, RAND war-gamed a North Korean attack on Seoul\'s wealthy
Gangnam district. \"Roughly half the size of Manhattan, Gangnam---a
district of Seoul---is a major economic center and home to many large
companies, such as Google and IBM. With some of the most expensive real
estate in the country, the district is also considered the most affluent
in all of South Korea. Consequences of a single DPRK nuclear attack on
Gangnam would be severe.\"

**[[By 2020 North Korea could possess]{.mark} as many as [100 nuclear
warheads]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[That\'s the startling conclusion of a [January 2019 report from
RAND,]{.mark} a California think tank with close ties to the U.S.
military.]{.underline}**

\"North Korean provocations and threats have created an unstable
environment on the Korean Peninsula,\" RAND\'s report explains[. \"North
Korea's ongoing development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles
increases the possibility of their use against regional states,
furthering instability across the region and beyond, thus affecting
vital U.S. interests.\"]{.underline}

(This first appeared several months ago.)

[To deliver its nukes, the [D]{.mark}emocratic [P]{.mark}eople\'s
[R]{.mark}epublic of [K]{.mark}orea, as the regime in Pyongyang calls
itself, [is building up a]{.mark} large [stockpile of rockets]{.mark} of
varying ranges.]{.underline}

\"The DPRK's growing arsenal will provide its regime with multiple
options to employ its nuclear weapons,\" the RAND report warns.

**[[North Korea possesses]{.mark} more than [650 short- and medium-range
ballistic missiles capable of hitting cities throughout South Korea,
Japan and eastern China,]{.mark}\" the think tank noted. \"If
successfully mated with nuclear weapons, these missiles will allow the
DPRK to [hold military bases and population centers in northeast Asia at
risk.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**

And if Pyongyang succeeds in developing a long-range rocket, it could
also target Guam, Hawaii, Alaska and the northwestern continental United
States.

[With an arsenal of up to 100 nuclear warheads and a wide range of
rockets to deliver them, Pyongyang could pursue a nuclear-war strategy
that might actually work, RAND explained in its report.]{.underline}

\"The DPRK could explode one or more early in a conflict as a warning,
while reserving a salvo of 20 to 60 weapons to attack military targets
like troop concentrations, air bases and seaports,\" the think tank
posited.

\"This would leave enough for a final salvo of 30 to 40 weapons to
threaten attacks against cities in South Korea, Japan, China, Russia
and---if they develop the delivery means---targets in the United
States.\"

For its report, RAND war-gamed a North Korean attack on Seoul\'s wealthy
Gangnam district. \"Roughly half the size of Manhattan, Gangnam---a
district of Seoul---is a major economic center and home to many large
companies, such as Google and IBM. With some of the most expensive real
estate in the country, the district is also considered the most affluent
in all of South Korea. Consequences of a single DPRK nuclear attack on
Gangnam would be severe.\"

**[If Pyongyang struck Gangnam with a 100-kiloton airburst nuke, 400,000
people instantly might die. Another million could suffer
injuries.]{.underline}**

[Seoul lies just 35 miles from the demilitarized zone between the DPRK
and the Republic of Korea in the south. Any number of existing missiles
could deliver an atomic warhead to such a close target. North Korea\'s
longest-range operational missile, the Musudan, can travel 1,900 miles
and deliver a nuke to Japan, China and Russia.]{.underline}

The Hwasong series of rockets that the DPRK is developing can travel as
far as 6,200 miles and threaten the U.S. mainland.

RAND\'s report recommends a comprehensive response to the North Korean
threat. \"In addition to multilateral diplomatic measures to halt the
DPRK's nuclear progress, the United States and its allies in the
region---as well as China---must take steps to reduce the risks posed by
the North's nuclear program.

\"These steps range from creative U.S. operational concepts to fight,
move and sustain in new ways; U.S.-ROK work on crisis management
procedures and mechanisms; trilateral coordination with Seoul and Tokyo
on ways to mitigate the threat; and an accelerating dialogue with China
on responses to various crisis scenarios.\"

**[U.S. president Donald Trump\'s June 2018 meeting with North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore didn\'t result in any meaningful
progress toward disarmament. Shortly after the summit, [Trump falsely
declared that the DPRK was \"no longer a nuclear
threat.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**

As of early 2019, the Trump administration reportedly was scouting
potential locations for a second Trump-Kim summit.

http://www.chinausfriendship.com/article1.asp?mn=551//ALiang

There are three potential flashpoints in Asia between Washington and
Beijing; they are North Korea, Taiwan, and the South China Sea. Any one
of these could evolve into a major military conflict in the
not-too-distant future. The conflict in the South China Sea (SCS) is the
result of the U. S. policy of \"pivot to Asia\" and is hyped by the news
media and some pundits. Washington continues to send war ships and spy
planes into the region and insists that the objective is to maintain
freedom of navigation in the SCS so that U. S. allies in the region will
not be affected. But China never said that it will block the passage in
the SCS. China always wanted to maintain freedom of navigation in the
SCS because it is vital to both trade and fuel (oil and gas) shipments
to China. Freedom of navigation in the SCS is much more important to
China than to the U. S. The SCS is only of peripheral interest to
Washington while it is critical to the economy of China. Besides,
Washington has a trump card in the conflict in the SCS. If China
threatens to block the sea lanes, Washington can easily stop the fuel
shipment from the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Iraq) to China by
blocking the narrow strait of Malacca near Singapore (a close U. S.
ally). If anything, it should be Beijing, instead of Washington, that
should insist on freedom of navigation in the SCS. It is well known that
the real motive behind the \"pivot to Asia\" is to thrust U. S. power
into the SCS so that it can maintain Washington\'s hegemony in South
Asia. Therefore the SCS conflict between Washington and Beijing is not
likely to escalate further because the interest there is totally uneven
and lop-sided (The United States has no strategic interests in the seas
adjacent to China's coast), unless the U. S. is willing to go to war
against China for some peripheral interest. Furthermore, a majority of
nations (Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, and the
Philippines) near the SCS do not wish to see conflicts between
Washington and Beijing. This leaves the remaining two potentially
dangerous areas in Asia between Washington and Beijing that need to be
addressed. There is not much time left (probably between five to ten
years) for peaceful resolution of the conflicts. These lead to the main
subject of this essay, a grand bargain. **[The most pressing issue for
the U. S. is the development of the nuclear weapons program in North
Korea.]{.underline}** The **[[development of nuclear weapons and missile
technology of North Korea over the last ten years has threatened the
security of South Korea (an U. S. ally]{.mark}). If this is not stopped,
the [long-range missiles]{.mark} with nuclear warheads may
[eventually]{.mark} (probably in five years) [become capable of reaching
the U. S. territory]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Washington tried
everything, from economic sanctions to military threats, with little
success, to stop North Korea from continuing development of its nuclear
program. **[The U. S even enlisted some support from China to put
pressure on North Korea. But [China, mindful of the collapse of the
North Korean government which may cause stability and security problems
for China, did not fully support the U. S]{.mark}. The stalemate
continues and [the situation is getting worse as time goes
by]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The situation across the Taiwan strait is
also getting worse. **[The "President" of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, and the
Democratic Progressive Party (which controls the Parliament) refuse to
accept the one-China policy of both China and the U. S. It is clear that
Tsai is moving Taiwan toward independence]{.underline}**. The people of
Taiwan and Tsai think that they can do so because they have the support
and protection of Washington. This false sense of security will
inevitably lead to military confrontation between the mainland of China
and Taiwan. In the mainland of China, there is already talk of unifying
the country by force if Taiwan continues its current trend of
development. The question is: how long will Taiwan last if it continues
to move towards independence? Ten years from now, if the mainland of
China decides to invade Taiwan, will Washington come to the rescue and
be drawn into military conflict with the mainland of China? Do not
forget that, ten years from now, China\'s economy will be as big as that
of the U. S. Here again the United States has no strategic interests in
the seas adjacent to China's coast, other than to contain China and
maintain U. S. hegemony in the western Pacific. As is well known that
**[North Korea is totally isolated from the rest of the world, and its
only ally is China. [Because of the U. S. sanctions, North Korea depends
for its survival entirely on China for food, fuel, etc]{.mark}. It has
become clear that, other than using unilateral action against North
Korea (such as a pre-emptive strike), [Washington must go through China
to resolve the nuclear problems of North Korea. A pre-emptive strike
against North Korea could have devastating consequences on South Korea
and create instability in the region]{.mark}. China definitely does not
wish to see an unstable North Korea and the collapse of the current
regime.]{.underline}** North Korea is an ally of China. China is
unlikely to stand by and watch the collapse of the current North Korea
regime. **[Therefore, a pre-emptive strike against North Korea is likely
to draw China into the conflict, not to mention the devastating effects
on the people of South Korea.]{.underline}** Some experts are calling
for Japan to become a nuclear power to deal with China. But this is a
very dangerous proposal because when Japan becomes a nuclear power, it
no longer needs the protection of Washington. It may turn against the U.
S. in the future (remember Nagasaki and Hiroshima). The issue is then
how **[to de-nuclearize the Korean peninsula without creating
instability in the region. All parties involved (China, the U. S.,
Russia, South Korea, and Japan) seem to agree that the only feasible way
to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear program is through China
because the former\'s survival depends almost exclusively on the
latter]{.underline}**. So far, [**[China has only showed lukewarm
response on sanctions against North Korea even though Beijing has
consistently stated that it wishes to see a nuclear-free zone in
North-East Asia]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[There is no real incentive
for China to take serious action to force North Korea to give up its
nuclear program]{.underline}**. Some pundits believe that there may be
incentives for China not to pressure North Korea to give up its nuclear
program. New strategy and fresh thinking are needed. **[Insecurity is
the primary cause of the nuclear development program in North
Korea]{.underline}**. In view of what happened to Saddam Hussein of Iraq
and Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, **[Kim Jong-un of North Korea believes
that possessing nuclear weapon is the only way for him and his regime to
survive under the threat of U. S. and South Korea. To alleviate this
fear and insecurity, Washington should promise not to attack North Korea
if the latter dismantles its nuclear program.]{.underline}** Similarly
North Korea should promise not to attack South Korea. So a treaty of
non-aggression is needed between North Korea and the U. S. (and South
Korea). The purpose is to maintain stability in the Korean peninsula.
**[This will be welcomed by the North Koreans and the
Chinese.]{.underline}** Second, **[Washington should promise to remove
all the existing sanctions against North Korea so that the latter can
begin to develop its economy.]{.underline}** If North Korea accepts
these offers, the next step should be the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the U. S. and North Korea. **[But just removing the
sanctions and promising not to attack may not be enough to induce
Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program. If Pyongyang still refuses to
accept the offer then [Washington must engage China to join in the
negotiation]{.mark} by offering China some incentive.]{.underline}**
What kind of **[incentive will be most effective in persuading Beijing
to join Washington and seriously considering an all-out effort to stop
the nuclear program of North Korea? The [incentive should be]{.mark}
related to one of the core interests of China. On top of the list is
[Taiwa]{.mark}]{.underline}**[n]{.mark}. The mainland of China and
Taiwan were separated as a result of the civil war in 1949. It is still
separated today. **[[The major barrier for unification is the U. S.
which still supports Taiwan by selling weapons]{.mark} and promises to
help defend Taiwan if attacked by the mainland of China (through the
Taiwan Relations Act passed by Congress), even though Washington has
consistently backed the one-China policy]{.underline}**. Washington
should tell Taiwan to accept that there is only one China. This is not
new and is consistent with U. S. policy since 1972 when President Nixon
visited China. **[Taiwan's acceptance of the one-China policy is
unlikely to be sufficient for the mainland of China to act on North
Korea]{.underline}**. **[Washington should move one step further and
tell Taiwan to start negotiating with Beijing on how (in what form) and
when (a time table) to reunite Taiwan with the mainland of
China]{.underline}**. **[If Taiwan refuses to do so, Washington can
simply threaten to cancel the Taiwan Relations Act and leave Taiwan to
deal with the situation all by itself.]{.underline}** It is interesting
that **[Washington supports the one-China policy but still sells weapons
to Taiwan, while Beijing wants a nuclear-free Korean peninsula but still
supports North Korea]{.underline}**. It **[is absolutely not acceptable
for Washington to have a nuclear-armed North Korea. It is absolutely not
acceptable for Beijing to let Taiwan drift away from China. If Taiwan
and North Korea continue to move in the current direction, then military
conflicts are unavoidable in the near future not just between North and
South Koreans but also between the mainland of China and
Taiwan]{.underline}**; and it is likely that Washington and Beijing will
also be dragged into mutual military conflicts. **[It is therefore of
great interest and utmost importance for both Washington and Beijing to
stop the current trend in North Korea and Taiwan.]{.underline}**
Washington has been playing the Taiwan card for a long time. **[[Taiwan
has been a bargaining chip against the mainland of China]{.mark}. In the
meantime, the U. S. has been selling obsolete weapons to Taiwan to make
some profit]{.underline}**. On the other hand**[[, even though North
Korea is a military ally of China, one cannot rule out the possibility
that Beijing is using North Korea as a bargaining chip against
Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Beijing and Washington should do what
they both preached in the past. **[For China, it is a nuclear-free
Korean peninsula. For the U. S., it is one China]{.underline}**. **[If
Pyongyang refuses to accept the offer from Washington (not to attack
North Korea and remove sanctions), China can threaten to break the
military alliance with North Korea and stop all the aid and assistance
to Pyongyang,]{.underline}** and tell the latter to deal with the
situation (possibly a pre-emptive strike by the U. S.) all by itself.
**[The deal costs very little for all parties involved. Every country
has something to gain: the gain for the U. S. is a non-nuclear Korean
peninsula and for China is a peacefully unified China. A stable North
Korea means the current regime will be in peace with South Korea and the
U. S., and will be able to develop its economy and improve the standard
of living for its people]{.underline}**. A unified China means **[Taiwan
can maintain its current way of living without the fear of invasion by
the much stronger China for an indefinite period of time]{.underline}**.
**[Taiwan will benefit greatly by reducing the spending on weapons and
its economy will recover with the help of China. Without the deal, it is
quite likely (maybe in ten years) that Beijing will resort to
non-peaceful means to force Taiwan to surrender. Some conservatives in
the U. S. may criticize the deal by saying that it is a bad deal because
it looks like Washington betrayed its friends in Taiwan]{.underline}**.
But Taiwan was betrayed by previous U. S. Presidents which include
Nixon, Carter, Reagan, etc. when the one-China policy was adopted and
continued over the past forty years That being said, there will be major
barriers for each of the involved parties. The most difficult one to
deal with is the dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-un. He is a mad man
and is unpredictable. Whether he will accept the deal is by no means
assured. The second barrier may be China. The hawkish faction in China
may not want to give up their alliance with their long-time and only
ally. In the U. S. some conservative Republicans and politicians do not
wish to see a unified China. In Taiwan, "President" Tsai Ing-wen and the
Democratic Progressive Party still dream that one day Taiwan will become
independent, which eventually will lead to disaster for the people
there. However, all of these barriers become minor when compared to
peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and Taiwan Strait. According
to people who know the next president of the U. S., Donald Trump,
everything will be transactional. **[Trump himself said that everything
is on the table and there is nothing to stop him from using Taiwan as
bargaining chip for trade and other things in dealing with the mainland
of China]{.underline}**. He even hinted that he may reconsider the
long-held U. S. policy of one China. To use Taiwan as a bargaining chip
against the mainland of China is not a bad idea, although he did not
specify the details. **[Reconsidering the one-China policy is not only a
dead end but also extremely dangerous for Taiwan because Beijing is then
free to use force to conquer Taiwan even if the latter did not declare
independence. Furthermore, China will not cooperate on helping the U. S.
in dealing with North Korea.]{.underline}**

#### North Korean miscalc causes extinction

**[Yun 14]{.underline}** Philip Yun is the executive director & COO of
the Ploughshares Fund, interviewed as part of an expert panel for the

<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/31/sp-north-korea-nuclear-weapons>

[**[The greatest danger comes from miscalculation]{.mark}**. Last year

In an environment where deadly skirmishes between the two Koreas are

### Scenario 2 is Space War

#### US-Sino Space war coming now

**[Feldscher and Zhen 19]{.underline}** Jacqueline Feldscher and Liu
Zhen, 6-16-2019, \"Are the U.S. and China on a war footing in space?,\"
POLITICO,
<https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/16/war-in-space-trump-china-1365842>
Lowell-SB

**[A top Chinese general has a warning for any U.S. leaders planning an
[arms race in space]{.mark}: Be prepared to lose.]{.underline}**

**[Outspending a rival power into economic exhaustion might have helped
the U.S. win the Cold War, said Qiao Liang, a major general in the
Chinese air force who co-wrote a book called \"Unrestricted Warfare:
China's Master Plan to Destroy America.\" But he said it won't work
against a wealthy manufacturing powerhouse like China.]{.underline}**

"China is not the Soviet Union," Qiao said in an interview with the
South China Morning Post, a news partner of POLITICO. "If the United
States thinks it can also drag China into an arms race and take down
China as it did with the Soviets ... in the end, probably it would not
be China who is down on the ground."

Qiao's words come as both Washington and Beijing are pouring money and
resources into an increasingly militarized space race that some security
specialists and former U.S. officials fear is heightening the risk of
war. The aggressive maneuvers include President Donald Trump's proposal
for a standalone Space Force --- which Qiao dismisses as "an unwise
move" --- and efforts by both countries to develop laser and cyber
weapons that could take out each other\'s satellites.

**[The [rivalry is]{.mark} plainly [on the minds of leaders at the
Pentagon]{.mark}, [which cites \"space\" 86 times in a new threat
assessment of China\'s military]{.mark}. It also warns that the
[P]{.mark}eople\'s [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy [is working
on]{.mark} \"enabling [long-range precision strikes\"]{.mark} and
developing directed-energy weapons for use in orbit.]{.underline}**

Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and a slew of U.S. military leaders
have cited China\'s military space programs as a key rationale for
proposing the Space Force, which would gather nearly all the Defense
Department's space-related programs into a new military branch ---
similar to one China created four years ago. Congress is considering the
administration's plan, although some defense hawks are skeptical.

Pence has also expressed alarm at China's success in landing un-crewed
probes on the moon, a place U.S. astronauts last visited in 1972. "Last
December, China became the first nation to land on the far side of the
moon and revealed their ambition to seize the lunar strategic high
ground and become the world's preeminent spacefaring nation," Pence said
at a meeting of the National Space Council in March.

**[Even more worrying, [neither country]{.mark} [seems]{.mark}
[interested in placing the issue on the diplomatic agenda to lower the
tensions]{.mark}, some security advocates say. That's in [contrast to
the decades of space cooperation that have existed between the U.S. and
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

\"One of my biggest concerns is that for all the talk about how horrible
an armed conflict with China would be for everyone, all the current U.S.
policies and actions seem to be preparing for armed conflict instead of
avoiding it," said Brian Weeden, the director of program planning at the
Secure World Foundation, which advocates for using space in a peaceful
and sustainable way.

"There is not a lot of dialogue between the U.S. and China,\" Weeden
said.

**[But other space experts say [China is a greater threat to the United
States]{.mark} than most people realize --- and even an "imminent
threat," independent analyst Namrata Goswami said.]{.underline}**

["If anything, \[[the threat from China\] is under-appreciated and
underplayed in the U.S]{.mark}.," she said. "I suspect that is because
the U.S. military might not want to call attention to its own
vulnerabilities regarding its space assets."]{.underline}

\"When the United States and the Soviet Union engaged in the Cold War
and the arms race, the United States was the largest manufacturing
country, and the Soviet Union was not even the second," he said. \"But
today it is China who is the world\'s top manufacturer.\"

Recent reports from U.S. spy agencies and think tanks indicate that
China\'s efforts are advancing quickly. Those include estimates that
China will soon be able to field high-powered lasers designed to attack
objects in low-Earth orbit --- and evidence that Chinese weapons can
already attack targets much farther from the Earth than the United
States can.

China's reliance on space assets is also expanding: It has more than 120
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites of its own ---
a number second only to the United States. About half of those assets
owned and operated by the Chinese military and could be used to track
and target U.S. forces around the world, the report warns.

**[The threat getting the most attention is the danger China's orbiting
weapons might pose to the satellites the United States relies on for
communications, navigation and surveillance --- for both military
operations and economic well-being.]{.underline}**

China is heavily investing in so-called counterspace technology,
including the development of at least three antisatellite missile
systems, according to an April report from the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. It is also developing satellites that touch other
satellites in orbit, the report said. While that technology can be used
for repairs in orbit, it can also be used to disable a satellite or tear
off a solar array to affect a satellite's power source.

The Pentagon's China Military Power report found that China is also
pursuing new jamming and "directed energy" weapons that can interfere
with satellites. In a conflict, that technology would probably be used
to "blind and deafen the enemy," the report said.

China also reorganized the People's Liberation Army in 2015 to create a
Strategic Support Force, a military branch dedicated entirely to space,
electronic and cyber warfare. The new branch was designed to bring space
assets from across the Chinese military under one organization, similar
to the goal of the U.S. Space Force.

The space-centric branch, which reports directly to the Central Military
Commission, is focused primarily on satellite launches and intelligence,
navigation and communication operations, but also conducts research and
development on new counterspace capabilities, according to a Defense
Intelligence agency report published in February.

[Chinese military units are also training with missiles that could
damage or destroy satellites, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported
in February. And they will probably have a ground-based laser that can
blind optical sensors on satellites in low-Earth orbit by
2020.]{.underline}

**[Unlike the United States or Russia, China is also believed to have
the capacity to use missiles to attack satellites in the more distant
geosynchronous orbit, or 22,000 miles above Earth.]{.underline}**

If any country were to launch a kinetic strike in geosynchronous orbit,
the debris field would make the area, which is today used for critical
missions like early missile warning and weather observations, unusable.

"We have much more to lose in GEO than any other country," said Kaitlyn
Johnson, an associate fellow who specializes in space security at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies. "We wouldn't want to
have a first strike capability."

Military experts also worry that China could try to seize areas of the
moon that contain strategic resources including ice that could be used
for rocket fuel or life support.

But they say it's much more likely China would want to use dominance in
space to influence conflicts on Earth. Being able to threaten the
military's GPS or communications satellites might deter the U.S. from
getting involved in a conflict in the South China Sea, Weeden said.

The U.S. Space Force is intended to close some of those gaps by grouping
space troops together to build expertise and giving the new service
autonomy over its budget requests. One of the biggest goals of the new
branch is to speed up space acquisition, allowing new technology to be
fielded faster, and to develop a space "doctrine" that would oversee how
the U.S. fights conflicts when space platforms are at stake.

The Chinese government insists that it is merely responding to
aggressive U.S. moves to dominate space militarily. And Qiao called it
"bullying and hegemonic" for the United States to insist that other
countries can't follow suit.

\"The U.S. space troops have long existed,\" Qiao said. \"They just did
not become an independent force. \... Moreover, the U.S. possessed
anti-satellite capabilities as early as the 1970s and 1980s. China only
developed anti-satellite capabilities by the end of the 1990s and even
in the first decade of this century.\"

He insisted that China has little choice but to enhance its own
capabilities.

\"China's purpose to develop space capabilities, firstly, is we do not
want to be blackmailed by others,\" Qiao maintained in the interview.
\"Second, we hope to use space peacefully. But if others want to oppress
us by occupying the heights of space and opening up a \'fourth
battlefield\' China will certainly not accept it.\"

Still, China remains far from overcoming American dominance, Qiao said.
\"We cannot surpass the U.S. in the next decade or two, but we will
narrow the gap in a comprehensive way," he said. "And it is possible to
we may take the lead in some individual areas."

Weeden agreed.

"China is developing many of the same space capabilities the U.S. did
decades ago, while the U.S. is focused on sustaining its capabilities
and making them more resilient," he said. "On the whole, the U.S. is
still far more capable than China is but the relative advantage is
narrowing."

**[The two nations have some diplomatic channels through which they
could cooperate in space, including the United Nations' Committee on the
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, of which both the U.S. and China are
members. In 2015, the Obama administration also established a dialogue
with China on space safety, which is quietly continuing under Trump,
although the meetings are mostly high-level talks, Weeden
said.]{.underline}**

But the Wolf Amendment, which was first passed in an appropriations bill
in 2011, forbids the U.S. government from working with China and
prohibits any bilateral cooperation between the China National Space
Administration and NASA on national security grounds. And there's
virtually no collaboration between the militaries of the two nations
today.

To open the door for conversations that could ease tensions and avoid
miscommunication, the U.S. and China must "crawl before we walk," Audrey
Schaffer, the director of space strategy and plans at the Defense
Department, said at a March event on U.S.-China space relations hosted
by the Secure World Foundation.

Some potential first steps include the two countries sharing information
like their national defense strategies, providing launch notifications
of space vehicles or opening routine, secure communications channels
between U.S. and Chinese diplomats. Each step would help build trust and
transparency, Schaffer said, and pointed to the strong relationship
between the U.S. and Russia in space as evidence that it can be done.

**["Even then when the relationship was just as strained, if not more
so, we did manage to work bilaterally and multilaterally with the
Soviets to really create mechanisms that would help reduce the risks of
conflict and enhance stability," Schaffer said.]{.underline}**

#### Taiwan conflict would escalate to space

**[NYT 15]{.underline}** The Editorial Board, 6-29-2015, \"Preventing a
Space War,\" New York Times,

Lowell-SB

Of all the places where conflict could erupt, space might seem the least
likely, except in movies. **[But [increasingly, it is becoming a
contested environment posing new dangers.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[The United States sees this as a vital security issue]{.underline}.
"Potential adversaries understand our reliance on space and want to take
it away from us," a senior Pentagon official, told Congress in March.
And while everything from control of nuclear weapons to weather
forecasting to cellphone use could be affected, the United States "is
not adequately prepared for a conflict" in space with countries like
China and Russia, he acknowledged.

**[[The specific concern is the security of thousands of satellites and
vehicles]{.mark}, like the international space station, [that orbit
Earth.]{.mark} [America has long dominated space, but many other nations
also have valuable assets in orbit.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[Satellites enable the Pentagon to locate enemies on the battlefield,
verify arms control treaties and ensure early warning if an adversary
targeted the country with an intercontinental ballistic
missile.]{.underline}

In the Cold War, the United States and Russia engaged in limited testing
of antisatellite, or ASAT, weapons. Now China, and to a lesser extent
Russia, are actively developing such offensive capabilities, including
jammers, lasers and cyber weapons that could damage satellite
operations.

A turning point came in 2007 when China conducted its first successful
ASAT test by blowing up one of its own weather satellites. The hit
unleashed more than 3,000 pieces of debris into space and fed suspicions
about China's intentions. **[[Suggestions by Chinese experts that, in a
conflict over Taiwan, Beijing might be able to shoot down an American
early warning satellite only deepened American
concerns.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Preventing conflicts in space will require more
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. China, which has shown little interest
in focusing on the issue, agreed last week during talks in Washington to
hold regular discussions on space cooperation and avoiding satellite
collisions[. Some concrete progress on these issues would be helpful
when President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China hold a summit
meeting in the fall.]{.underline}

[China and Russia have proposed a legally binding treaty that would ban
the use of force or weapons in space, but most experts consider such a
pact unverifiable. A more practical course **would be for them to work
with the United States and the European Union to establish norms for
responsible behavior**, including not to test ASAT weapons]{.underline}.
A United Nations-convened meeting planned for July should aim to approve
a code of conduct proposed by the Europeans, whether or not Russia and
China sign on.

#### Reducing US arms sales to Taiwan allows for collaboration in space

Collaboration in Space between the U.S., China, and Australia: Woomera

When asked about ''the prospect of cooperation between China and the
United States in outer space'' at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore
in June 2011, former Secretary Gates responded with the following: We
have just begun a dialogue that I think is very important. On the
sidelines of the strategic and economic dialogue that has been going on
for several years now between China and the United States at a very
senior level, we had the first session beginning with a security
dialogue; the first two subjects we discussed were cyber and maritime
security. Yesterday \[China's Minister of National Defense\] General
Liang \[Guanglie\] and I talked about other subjects that might be
addressed going forward in that forum and other subjects would, I
believe, include outer space. I think that here is an opportunity in the
future. For some time I have believed that expanding this dialogue
between us would be quite beneficial to both of us. That July, Deputy
Assistant Secretary Schulte made this statement: We've actually proposed
to establish a regular dialogue with China on space \[. \... \] We're
waiting to pick the date for the first discussion, but we're ready to go
in to talk about this strategy, to talk about what we think responsible
use of space looks like \[ \...and\] about ways to reduce the risk of
mishap or miscalculation or misunderstandings. These statements and
**[[U.S. policy suggest that the U.S. wants to cooperate with China in
space]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While that may seem to contrast with other
economic or military forms of competition between the two, it is quite
logical given the nature of space activities. **[[Space
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** a global commons that is very **[[expensive to
access and]{.underline}]{.mark}** very **[[vulnerable to
interference]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Competition in space is
extremely costly, which makes cooperation
preferable.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The U.S. learned this during the Cold
War and anticipates that as China becomes more dependent on space it
will also see the value in space cooperation. The extent of improved
U.S.- China space cooperation includes a wide range of possibilities.
Increased transparency in space operations is a clear starting point.
Activities that may involve technology transfers are complicated, given
U.S. security concerns and the Chinese desire for a self-reliant space
program. Policy changes suggest the beginning of conversations on these
issues rather than any specific goals for U.S.-China space cooperation.
However, **[[the primary barrier to bilateral,]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and certainly trilateral, **[[space cooperation is
trust]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although direct U.S.-China military
collaboration is unlikely for many decades, both commercial and civil
collaborations have been tried. In the 1990s, **[[the launch of U.S.
commercial satellites on Chinese rockets led to allegations of
unauthorized technology transfers.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[China's
civil involvement in the EU's Galileo project ended in competition and
intentional frequency overlap]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In addition to
historical experience, China's weak IP protections and military
oversight of all space activities suggest that it is a poor partner for
space collaboration. Lastly, it must be acknowledged that
**[[authoritarian rule and lack of respect for human rights create even
another layer of mistrust, although political progress has been made in
separating those concerns from other issues.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This
results in political challenges to U.S.- China space cooperation, such
as the language inserted into a U.S. spending bill preventing NASA and
the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) from using any
federal funds for any cooperative efforts with China. The congressional
law is clearly contradictory to the leadership statements from the
Executive Branch cited above, although limited to NASA and the OSTP. The
instigator of these restrictions has announced his retirement in 2015,
suggesting a possible opening to lift them.49 Solving these trust issues
with respect to space collaboration depends mostly on China's
state-owned aerospace companies, its government space agencies, and
ultimately its military. Future commercial space cooperation will become
more likely with the successful outcome of the numerous aerospace
collaborations in civil aviation currently ongoing and the demonstration
of respect for IP.50 Civil collaborations will have to start with issues
of common concern and build from there. An obvious example would be
space debris issues, although China's test of an ASAT in 2007, which
overnight increased space debris by 50% and total tracked orbiting
objects by over 15%, makes even that difficult. However, global efforts
at disaster mitigation and weather monitoring from space provide other
avenues. Increased transparency and independence from military oversight
would also be conducive to space collaboration. **[[While the U.S. has a
long]{.underline}]{.mark}** and established **[[history of successful
international space collaborations]{.mark} that demonstrate trust and
transparency[, it does need to recognize that arms sales to Taiwan and
military developments around China]{.mark} may [inhibit the separation
of China's space activities from military control and diminish future
opportunities for collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For the past
decade, U.S. export policies for satellites have been extremely
restrictive. The current review of those policies and the technologies
offers the potential for some forms of future commercial collaboration
with China.

#### US-China collab helps to set international space norms

Landing on the Moon in 1969 was one of the greatest achievements in
human history. This accomplishment was the result of the Space Race
between the United States and the Soviet Union. Now, the United States
endeavors to go to the Moon again.

**[Even during the Cold War, [the United States and the Soviet Union
cooperated in space]{.mark}. The United States can find ways to work
with China.]{.underline}**

**[This time, [the United States should go to the Moon]{.mark} not
[based on]{.mark} competition but on [cooperation]{.mark}. [China's
space capabilities are improving rapidly]{.mark} and its space
presence]{.underline}** is expanding. Collaboration with China can bring
financial and diplomatic benefit. Last December, the Trump
Administration declared its intent to go back to the Moon and go beyond.
To achieve this goal, international cooperation is necessary**[. To
achieve this goal, the United States should travel to the Moon with
China as a new partner.]{.underline}**

[While the United States has built trust and cooperation with many
countries in space, so far it has not worked with China. The US space
station program was originally designed in the context of Cold
War]{.underline}. Eventually, the United States invited Russia to the
International Space Station and deepened international cooperation in
space. **[On the other hand, in 2011, a [federal law prohibited NASA
from working with China]{.mark} for national security
reasons.]{.underline}**

[[This prohibition should be eliminated]{.mark} and the United States
should collaborate with China. Cooperation should proceed step by step.
Even during the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union
cooperated in space.]{.underline} The United States can find ways to
work with China. As a first step, the United States should admit China
to participate in the International Space Station.

The US human spaceflight program requires a great amount of money, and
cooperation with China can contribute to reducing US costs. This
February, the Trump Administration presented NASA's budget request with
a renewed emphasis on human spaceflight. Yet, in the long term, NASA's
budget will likely not significantly increase. It will be difficult to
go back to the Moon if funding levels remain flat. China also aims to go
to the Moon. **[If the United States works with China in the
International Space Station program and other human spaceflight
programs, they can share the financial burden. [The United States can
reduce its costs]{.mark} and accomplish its goal with less
expenditure.]{.underline}**

[**Suspicion can escalate confrontation, but trust can avoid an arms
race. Last December, the US National Security Strategy classified China
as "revisionist." There are concerns that conflicts between the United
States and China are inevitable in the near future.** To avoid
conflicts, [increasing cooperation is beneficial]{.mark} for both
countries. In fact, the US and Chinese governments already have a space
dialogue. Taking a step to operational cooperation in space will be a
good start to building more trust.]{.underline}

**[This time, the United States should lead the international space
society and travel to the Moon and beyond together, with China as a new
partner.]{.underline}**

This cooperation benefits not only both countries but the whole of
international space society. Nowadays, there are many problems in space
policy: space debris, weaponization of space, and controversial
international space law. To resolve these issues, international
cooperation is essential**[. [As the United States and China share more
common interests in space, it will become easier for them to address
international issues together.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

There are security concerns that China would steal US space technology
and develop its own capabilities. But this planned collaboration is in
civil, not military, space operations. [The **[United States would limit
the exchange so as not to leak its advanced technology]{.mark}**.
Additionally, even if China keeps building its own space station after
its participation in the ISS, its own station can be used to support the
ISS. China has already developed its own space technology. Cooperation
would not be a unilateral relationship, but one of mutual
benefit.]{.underline}

#### Space prolif is possible and is an existential crisis-- brink is now

**[Graff 18]{.underline}** Garret Graff, 6-26-2018, \"The New Arms Race
Threatening to Explode in Space,\" WIRED,
<https://www.wired.com/story/new-arms-race-threatening-to-explode-in-space/>
Lowell-SB

FOR DAYS, [US intelligence had been picking up indications that China
was about to conduct a missile test aimed at outer space. The analysts
next door---and their counterparts around the world---were tracking
ground-based radar signals, monitoring infrared sensors, and poring over
images from telescopes in space. All of them were briefing Shelton on
what they were observing in real time.]{.underline} At 2:28 pm (PST)
their readouts showed a ballistic missile taking off from China's
Xichang Satellite Launch Center, located in the wooded mountains of
Sichuan province. The missile rose into low Earth orbit, about 500 miles
above Earth's surface, and appeared to close in on an aging Chinese
weather satellite.

Then the telescopes showed a bright flash.

Minutes later, the radar screens began to track a growing cloud of
debris---at least 3,000 pieces of shrapnel that would each, Shelton
knew, spend the next several years slingshotting around Earth at speeds
that could far exceed that of a bullet. Shelton was stunned. The Chinese
had just shot a satellite out of the sky.

**[Not only was this a stupendous technological achievement---to launch
a missile from the ground and hit a celestial target moving as fast as
17,000 mph---it also showed a level of audacity not seen in space for
decades. "We couldn't imagine they would go against an actual
satellite," Shelton recalls. "Because of the debris something like that
creates, it's almost unthinkable." It felt like a wake-up
call.]{.underline}**

In the conference room, Shelton exhaled, set down his two telephones,
and pushed himself back from the table. "This changes everything," he
said to his staff.

For decades, America's satellites had circled Earth at a largely safe
remove from the vicissitudes of geopolitics. An informal global
moratorium on the testing of anti-satellite weapons had held since 1985;
the intervening decades had been a period of post--Cold War peace---and
unquestioned American supremacy---high overhead. During those decades,
satellites had become linchpins of the American military apparatus and
the global economy. By 2007, ships at sea and warplanes in the air had
grown reliant on instant satellite communications with ground stations
thousands of miles away. Government forecasters relied on weather
satellites; intelligence analysts relied on high-­resolution imagery to
anticipate and track adversaries the world over. GPS had become perhaps
the single most indispensable global system ever designed by
humans---the infrastructure upon which the rest of the world's
infrastructure is based. (Fourteen of the 16 infrastructure sectors
designated as critical by the Department of Homeland Security, like
energy and financial services, rely on GPS for their operation.)

Now, Shelton feared, all those satellites overhead had become so many
huge, unarmored, billion-dollar sitting ducks.

In the decade since China's first successful anti-satellite missile
test, Shelton's premonition has largely come true: Everything has
changed in space. A secretive, pitched arms race has opened up between
the US, China, Russia, and, to a lesser extent, North Korea[. [The
object of the race:]{.mark} to devise more and better ways [to]{.mark}
quickly [cripple your adversary's satellites]{.mark}. After decades of
uncontested US supremacy, multinational cooperation, and a diplomatic
consensus on reserving space for peaceful uses, military officials have
begun referring to Earth's orbit as a new "warfighting
domain."]{.underline}

**[On the ground, the military is starting to retrain pilots, ship
captains, and ground troops in fail-safe forms of navigation that don't
rely on GPS---like celestial navigation. [The US military must relearn
how to fight "unwired" and defend itself in space.]{.mark} "We knew how
to do that, and somehow we forgot," General John E. Hyten, the head of
US Strategic Command, said in 2015.]{.underline}**

When former director of national intelligence James Clapper left office
at the end of the Obama administration, he told me that the increasing
sophistication of America's adversaries in space was one of the top
three strategic threats he worried about. Clapper's successor, Dan
Coats, warned last spring that "Russia and China remain committed to
developing capabilities to challenge perceived adversaries in space,
especially the United States."

Since he took office, President Trump has dropped numerous hints of the
warnings he's evidently getting from military and intelligence leaders.
During a spring livestream with astronauts aboard the International
Space Station, he alluded, obliquely and without context, to the
"tremendous military applications in space." And he has repeatedly
floated the idea of creating a new branch of the armed forces
specifically for celestial combat---culminating last week with a speech
out-and-out ordering the Joint Chiefs of Staff to begin developing plans
for a new "Space Force."

**[But [if space is indeed becoming a war-­fighting domain, it's
important to understand the stakes, not just for America's strategic
standing but for the species]{.mark}.]{.underline}** A
Russo-Sino-American space war could very well end with a crippled global
economy, inoperable infrastructure, and a planet shrouded by the
orbiting fragments of pulverized satellites---which, by the way, could
hinder us all on Earth until we figured out a way of cleaning them up[[.
In the aftermath of such a conflict, it might be years before we could
restore new constellations of satellites to orbit.]{.mark} Preparing for
orbital war has fast become a priority of the US military, but the more
urgent priority is figuring out how to prevent it.]{.underline}

## Plan

#### The United States federal government should reduce arms sales to Taiwan. 

## Solvency

#### Halting arms sales to Taiwan signals complete severance of US-Taiwan ties- ensures US-China cooperation

Options for the Future of the U.S.-Taiwan Defense Relationship,\" Cato
Institute,
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship//ALiang

**[The United States should step down from the implicit commitment to
use military force to preserve Taiwan's de facto
independence.]{.underline}** **[American credibility is slowly eroding
as China becomes more powerful, and the commitment will be more costly
to maintain for a relatively minor benefit.]{.underline}** Broadly
speaking, **[the United States has two options for how it could
implement this policy option: it could try to draw concessions from
China to get something in return for stepping down from the
commitment,]{.underline}** or it could **[[unilaterally drop the
commitment]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In either scenario, Taiwan would have
to take on sole responsibility for deterring Chinese military action.
**[A policy that wins concessions from China would be the more desirable
of the two options. Concessions could include resolution of other
territorial disputes involving China and American allies or dropping the
Chinese threat to use force against Taiwan.]{.underline}** This would be
characteristic of what Charles Glaser calls **[a grand bargain, "an
agreement in which two actors make concessions across multiple issues to
create a fair deal ... that would have been impossible in an agreement
that dealt with a single issue]{.underline}**."95 **[Making the end of
the U.S. commitment to Taiwan contingent upon Chinese concessions to
resolve its other territorial disputes peacefully would benefit both the
United States and China.96 The United States would free itself of an
increasingly costly and risky commitment to Taiwan's defense, but only
if China compromises in ways that align with U.S. allies' interests in
the South and East China Seas. China would have to limit its objectives
in the South and East China Seas, but in return would earn a major
policy concession from the United States on a core national interest
that has much more importance than the other territorial
disputes]{.underline}**. If China proves unwilling to make concessions
across multiple issue areas, the United States could still push for
concessions on China's military posture toward Taiwan. **[Instead of
demanding a concession on the South China Sea dispute, U.S. policymakers
could press China to take actions that reduce the military threat it
poses to Taiwan via an incremental, reciprocal process of
concessions.9]{.underline}**7 **[[Refusing to sell Taiwan any new
military equipment would be a good way to initiate a cooperation
spiral]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Stopping the sale of new equipment would
not significantly reduce the Taiwanese military's ability to defend
itself for three reasons. First, most equipment sold to Taiwan by the
United States does not represent the latest in U.S. military technology
and is not necessarily superior to new capabilities fielded by the
PLA.98 Second, Taiwan's domestic defense industry is capable of
producing new equipment that is well-suited to asymmetric defense,
although it will take time for Taiwan's relatively small and
underdeveloped defense industry to reach its full potential.99
**[Finally, stopping the sale of new weapons still gives the United
States the latitude to sell spare parts and ammunition for weapons
systems that have already been sold]{.underline}**. **[[Halting the sale
of new types of weapons systems]{.mark} will [signal a reduced U.S.
commitment to Taiwan]{.mark}'s securit[y that would not be]{.mark}
overly [disruptive to Taiwan's self-defense.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[One of several ways that Beijing might respond to this U.S.
concession on arms sales would be to reduce the number of short-range
ballistic missiles (SRBMs) within firing range of Taiwan.]{.underline}**
**[Currently there are more than 1,000 conventionally armed SRBMs (with
a maximum range of approximately 500 miles) in the PLA arsenal that
could strike Taiwan.100 Improvements in guidance technology have
transformed these missiles from inaccurate "terror weapons" that would
likely target cities to precision munitions better suited for strikes
against military airfields and ports.101Stationing the SRBMs out of
range of Taiwan would be a low-cost, but [symbolically
important]{.mark}, action]{.underline}**. The missiles are fired from
mobile launchers that could be moved back into range of Taiwan. However,
**[[the act of moving the missiles out of range would]{.mark}, according
to Lyle J. Goldstein, "]{.underline}**

**[[show goodwill and increasing confidence across the Strait
and]{.mark} also [between Washington and
Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}**."102 If China agrees to America's demand
to relocate its ballistic missiles, then additional steps could be taken
to further reduce the threat China poses to Taiwan. If China proved
unwilling to make any concessions, either in other territorial disputes
or in cross-strait relations, **[the United States could still
unilaterally withdraw from its military commitment to Taiwan. No demands
or conditions would be placed on Chinese behavior.]{.underline}**
American policymakers are unlikely to accept such a course of action
given recent shows of Chinese assertiveness. Charles Glaser explains,
"China appears too likely to misinterpret \[unilaterally ending the U.S.
commitment to defend Taiwan\], which could fuel Chinese overconfidence
and intensify challenges to U.S. interests."103 **[[Unilateral
withdrawal]{.mark} would [reduce the likelihood of U.S.-Chinese armed
conflict, but]{.mark} the dearth of [other benefits]{.mark} would [make
the policy difficult for policymakers to
implement]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Extracting some kind of concession
from China, either in cross-strait relations or in other territorial
disputes, should be a priority. **[Finally, stepping down from the
commitment to defend Taiwan with military force does not remove
America's interest in keeping the Taiwan Strait free of armed
conflict]{.underline}**. **[The United States would retain the ability
to punish China in other ways should it attack Taiwan.]{.underline}**
Diplomatic isolation and economic sanctions may not inflict the same
kinds of costs on Beijing as military force, but they are additional
costs that would have to be absorbed.104 **[Additionally, U.S. arms
sales are separate from the implicit commitment to defend Taiwan and
could continue, albeit in some reduced or modified form.105 Continuing
to sell arms to Taiwan while stepping down from the implicit commitment
to use military force to defend the island allows the United States to
demonstrate support for Taiwan's defense without taking on the risks
associated with direct intervention.1]{.underline}**06 Conclusion The
United States should no longer provide the military backstop for
Taiwan's de facto independence. The security commitment to Taiwan
outlined in the TRA is a product of a different time, when the United
States enjoyed clear military advantages over China, and Taiwan could be
defended on the cheap. **[China's growing military power strains the
credibility of the American commitment.]{.underline}** **[Policymakers
in Washington could respond to this changing environment by restoring
American military superiority, sustaining a minimum military advantage,
or stepping down from the commitment. All of these options carry risks
and negative consequences, but [it is in the best long-term interest of
the United States to step down from the commitment to
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. American policymakers must come to terms
with the idea that the balance of power has become much more favorable
for Beijing since the TRA was adopted in 1979. Defending Taiwan is more
difficult now than ever before, and this trend will be very hard to
reverse**[. The most realistic way to reorient U.S. policy is to reach
out to China to take incremental, reciprocal steps that slowly bring
about the end of America's commitment.]{.underline}** This policy will
be very difficult for the United States to implement, **[[but the
advantages to U.S.-China relations could be substantial. Changing the
U.S.-Taiwan security relationship]{.mark} would greatly [reduce the
likelihood of armed conflict between the United States and China
and]{.mark} could [create opportunities for U.S.-China cooperation that
are currently beyond reach.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

the background: the worsening disagreement over the \"One China\"

state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.]{.underline}** \"**[Anything
where the US is interfering with Taiwan hits a national third

acknowledges China\'s claim that Taiwan is not an independent nation but
rather a part of China, without taking a side --- was developed during
the Nixon administration to improve US-China relations]{.underline}**.
The idea is central to China\'s identity as a modern world power, and
**[since President Donald Trump took office the US has challenged that
notion repeatedly. Despite protests from Beijing, Trump signed the

Affairs, neglected to mention Taiwan or the US]{.underline}**. **[The
Trump administration has also sold arms to Taiwan before, as have
previous administrations, but this \$2 billion arms sale digs at a
delicate wound during a delicate time]{.underline}**. It\'s a big sale,
even in a world where weapons are becoming more and more expensive. And
though it does not include the US\'s **[top fighter jets, it is sure to
antagonize Beijing before the G20 meeting at the end of the month in
Osaka, Japan, where US and Chinese heads of state are expected to
meet.]{.underline}** On Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry
representative, Geng Shuang, responded to the news of the arms sale with
a warning, according to the Chinese state media outlet Xinhua. \"**[We
urge the US side to stop arms sales to Taiwan and sever their military
ties, prudently and properly handle Taiwan-related issues, to avoid
serious damage to China-US relations as well as to the peace and
stability of the Taiwan Strait,\"]{.underline}** Geng said. It\'s just
imagination In January 2017, China --- most likely aware that the
incoming US president was unfamiliar with the complexities of
**[[US-China relations --- clarified its position on
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a rare US media interview by the
Chinese Foreign Ministry official Lu Kang. **[[\"Because this issue
touches upon China\'s core interest, by no means is this something that
could be negotiated or used as a bargaining
chip]{.mark},\"]{.underline}** he told NBC. \" One China policy, 100%.\"
The fight over Taiwan\'s status started in 1949 after the Nationalist
leader Chiang Kai-shek left the mainland for the island when he was
defeated by Mao Zedong\'s Communist forces. To the Chinese, the
island\'s independence is both a product and a reminder of China\'s
century of humiliation, when China was carved up by foreign powers and
then thrown into decades of chaos and civil war after the end of the
Qing dynasty. \"It\'s the mythology they\'ve told themselves for
years**[,\" Thornton said. In that way the [One China policy and
China\'s economic nationalism are tied together in the Chinese political
imagination.]{.mark}]{.underline}** That may seem foreign to the US,
**[where one set of technocrats handles economics and another handles
national security, but the merging of the two interests are a response
to the China\'s lost century. And both are being tested by the Trump
administration]{.underline}**. xi trump While the US-China trade war
producing a \" tech Cold War\" has grabbed headlines, less attention has
been paid to escalation in hostilities surrounding the One China policy.
This despite the fact that the conflict has all the trappings of the
Cold War era. China sees US interference in Taiwan as an encroachment on
its sphere of influence. And the US sees Chinese involvement in the
Caribbean similarly. Back in February 2018 after a speech in Texas,
then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Latin American nations of
China\'s \"imperial\" ambitions, invoking the Monroe Doctrine. \"Latin
America does not need new imperial powers that seek only to benefit
their own people,\" he said. \"China\'s state-led model of development
is reminiscent of the past. It doesn\'t have to be this hemisphere\'s
future.\" All of this matters for Taiwan because the more involved a
country is with China[, **[the more pressure China puts on it to wipe
Taiwan off the map]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Earlier this year the
Dominican Republic dropped its recognition of Taiwan at China\'s behest.
El Salvador did it in 2018, and Panama in 2017. There may be a Cold
War-reminiscent motivation behind this arms sale as well. **[Taiwan\'s
anti-China president, Tsai Ing-wen, faces an uphill battle for
reelection next year.]{.underline}** In Washington the sale may be seen
as a way to bolster her chances of winning. \"One thing US
administrations tend to think, which may or may not be true,\" Thornton
said, **[\"is that selling weapons to Taiwan helps political candidates
show that they have US support and can stand up to
China.\"]{.underline}**

Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and one of the most prominent
American analysts in Chinese security studies. Beyond American
Predominance in the Western Pacific: The Need for a Stable U.S.-China
Balance of Power
https://carnegieendowment.org/2015/04/20/beyond-american-predominance-in-western-pacific-need-for-stable-u.s.-china-balance-of-power-pub-59837

On the U.S. side, **[for an arguably growing number of American and some
foreign observers, [Beijing's de facto challenge to American
predominance]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the Western Pacific **[[is
a]{.mark} mere prelude to [a larger effort to eject the United States
from Asia and]{.mark} eventually [replace it]{.mark} as the
regional]{.underline}** (and for some, global)
**[superpower]{.underline}**. Chinese support for a multipolar,
balance-of-power system is thus seen as a mere tactical feint designed
to undermine U.S. power while Beijing prepares to become the new
hegemon. Indeed, **[for such observers, Beijing's greater assertiveness
regarding maritime territorial disputes]{.underline}** as well as U.S.
and Japanese intelligence and surveillance activities along its
coastline **[constitute strategic gambits designed to "test" U.S. and
allied resolve and ultimately to create "no-go" zones essential for the
establishment of Chinese control over the Western Pacific. Such an
outcome would directly threaten both U.S. and allied
interests]{.underline}** in an open, secure, and peaceful Asia-Pacific
region. **[Given this supposedly unambiguous threat, for these
observers, the only logical course of action for the United States is to
decisively disabuse Beijing of its aspirations by enhancing American
predominance and thereby increasing, rather than reducing, Chinese
vulnerability in the Western Pacific.]{.underline}**

**[This view]{.underline}** is held not only by scholars and policy
analysts outside Washington. It is also fairly common among U.S.
government officials, both civilian and military. It **[offers a
black-and-white, Manichean-type solution to a supposedly clear-cut
threat, and one that is extremely appealing to those many U.S.
policymakers and analysts convinced of the huge merits (and necessity)
of continued American predominance]{.underline}** in maritime Asia. In
fact, even for those who reject the notion that Beijing is working to
dislodge the United States from the region, predominance remains the
best insurance against an uncertain future, for the reasons outlined
above. While the type of U.S. predominance in Asia espoused by most U.S.
observers can vary somewhat, depending in part on how one views China's
capabilities and intentions, **[the bottom line for virtually all such
individuals is the need for a clear U.S. ability to prevail in any
important military-political contingency involving China]{.underline}**.
Moreover, **[this view is reinforced, in their minds, by the notion that
America's allies and friends also supposedly desire and require
continued U.S. maritime predominance.]{.underline}**

**[The problem with [this outlook is]{.mark} that it is based on an
[inaccurate]{.mark}, increasingly [unrealistic]{.mark}, [and
dangerous]{.mark} assessment of both the threat the United States
confronts in Asia and the likely consequences of the remedy proposed[.
Beijing's]{.mark} de facto [attempts]{.mark} [to limit or end U.S.
predominance]{.mark} along its maritime periphery [are
motivated]{.mark}]{.underline}** almost entirely [**[by uncertainties,
fears, insecurities]{.underline}**,]{.mark} and a certain level of
opportunism, **[[not a grand strategic vision of Chinese
predominance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, despite the arguably growing
expression of ultranationalist views within China. [**[Those who view
China as an aspiring hegemon seeking America's
subordination]{.underline}**]{.mark} and ultimate ejection from Asia
almost without exception **[[base their argument on shaky
theoretical]{.mark} [postulates]{.mark} and faulty historical analogies
or on the decidedly non-authoritative views of a few Chinese analysts,
not current, hard evidence regarding either Chinese strategies and
doctrines or Chinese behavior, past and present]{.underline}**.

**[Such observers argue]{.underline}** that **[all rising powers
seek]{.underline}** hard-power **[dominance]{.underline}** in an
anarchic interstate system and that China is a power that always sought
to dominate its world. **[However, such absolutist beliefs run counter
to the very mixed record of power grabbing and power balancing,
aggression and restraint, deterrence and reassurance that has
characterized great power relations historically. They]{.underline}**
also **[ignore the fact that, in the premodern era, Chinese predominance
within its part of Asia most often consisted of pragmatic and mutually
beneficial exchanges]{.underline}** of ritualistic deference for
material gains, **[not Chinese hard-power control. While implying a
preference for symbolically hierarchical relationships with smaller
neighbors, China's premodern approach did not amount to a demand
for]{.underline}** clear-cut **[dominance and
subordination]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[the advent of
modern]{.underline}**, independent, and in most cases strong
**[nation-states along China's borders; the forces of economic
globalization; and the existence of nuclear weapons have enormously
reduced, if not eliminated, both the willingness and the ability of
Chinese leaders today to dominate Asia and carve out an exclusionary
sphere of influence, especially in hard-power terms]{.underline}**. By
necessity, **[their objective is to reduce their considerable
vulnerability]{.underline}** and increase their political, diplomatic,
and economic leverage in their own backyard to a level where Chinese
interests must be reflected in those major political, economic, and
security actions undertaken by neighboring states. **[This is a much
less ambitious and in many ways understandable goal for a continental
great power. And it does not necessarily threaten vital U.S. or allied
interests]{.underline}**.

capacity to challenge the U.S. supremacy, but it **[does have the
capacity to prevent the United States from treading on issues concerning
its core interests]{.underline}**. After all, **[it is a significant
regional power]{.underline}**. As Acharya argued, **[emerging powers
will be playing a dominant role]{.underline}** in their respective
regions while socializing the United States **[in the era of a declining
American world order.]{.underline}** Because an independent Taiwan is
not acceptable to China, Taiwan's efforts to seek independence are
separating it from the strategic interests of the United States.83
**[[Taiwan is not able to serve the U.S. best strategic interests
anymore, and the Taiwan issue would become a big burden for Washington
if it involved in direct military clashes across the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Moreover, **[the United States needs to work with China to protect
American interests in the region]{.underline}** more than ever. **[[If

**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** issue, **[[are not protected, it is

sanctions on US firms over Taiwan arms sale,\",

Lowell-SB

**[US companies involved in a potential arms sale worth \$2.2bn to
self-ruled Taiwan will face sanctions, China said, warning Washington
\"not to play with fire\".]{.underline}**

Taiwan on Saturday defended the weapons purchase saying it will
strengthen Taiwan\'s self-defence in the face of a growing military
threat from China.

\"The national army will continue to strengthen its key defence forces,
ensure national security, protect its homeland, and ensure that the
fruits of freedom and democracy won\'t be attacked,\" the defence
ministry said in a statement.

The planned weapons sale, the first transfer of big-ticket US military
gear to democratically governed Taiwan in decades, came as ties between
Washington and Beijing are already strained by a trade war.

**[\"The US arms sale to Taiwan has severely violated the basic norms of
international law and international relations,\" Chinese foreign
ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement on
Friday.]{.underline}**

**[\"In order to safeguard national interests, China will impose
sanctions on US enterprises participating in this sale of weapons to
Taiwan,\" he said.]{.underline}**

Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during a visit to Hungary, asked the US to
\"recognise the gravity of the Taiwan question\".

[China, which views Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to one
day seize it, bristles at any country that lends the island state any
diplomatic support or legitimacy.]{.underline}

**[Even though Taiwan, which split from China following a civil war in
1949, doesn\'t have diplomatic ties with the US, Washington provides
Taipei with military and other support. Beijing regards this as
interference in its internal affairs.]{.underline}**

#### Trade war collapses the global economy

**[Jones 19]{.underline}** Marc Jones, 5-20-2019, \"Full-blown trade war
will push world toward recession,\" U.S.,
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-recession/full-blown-trade-war-will-push-world-toward-recession-morgan-stanley-idUSKCN1SQ1R4>
Lowell-SB

LONDON (Reuters) - A collapse of U.S.-China trade talks and hike in
tariffs on Chinese goods would push the world economy toward recession
and see the Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates back to zero within
a year, analysts at Morgan Stanley said on Monday.

Port, in northern China, May 16, 2019. REUTERS/Jason Lee

While a temporary escalation of trade tensions could be navigated
without much damage at all, a lasting breakdown would inflict serious
pain.

["If talks stall, no deal is agreed upon and the U.S. imposes 25%
tariffs on the remaining circa \$300 billion of imports from China, we
see the global economy heading towards recession," the bank's analysts
said in a note.]{.underline}

[In response, the Fed would cut rates all the way back to zero by spring
2020 while China would scale up its fiscal stimulus to 3.5% of GDP
(equivalent to around \$500 billion) and its broad credit growth target
to 14-15% a year, they added.]{.underline}

"But, a reactive policy response and the usual lags of policy
transmission would mean that we might not be able to avert the
tightening of financial conditions and a full-blown global recession."

A global recession is defined by growth dipping below the 2.5% a year
threshold.

[In a middle scenario where 25% tariffs on \$200 billion of U.S. imports
from China stay in place for 3-4 months, global growth could slow around
50 basis points to 2.7% a year.]{.underline}

They predicted the Fed would cut rates by 50 basis points to cushion the
blow while Beijing would up its total fiscal expansion to 2.25% of GDP,
or about \$320 billion.

Morgan Stanley's analyst also warned investors could be underestimating
the impact of trade tensions in a number of ways.

Firstly, the impact on the U.S. corporate sector would be more
widespread as China could put up non-tariff barriers such as restriction
of purchases.

[Given the global growth slowdown that would follow, profits from firms'
international operations would be hit and companies would not be able to
fully pass through the tariff increases to consumers.]{.underline}

[The indirect impact would be "non-linear" too, with a sharp tightening
of financial conditions and policy uncertainty hitting firms' confidence
to the extent that they freeze or cutback on capital
expenditure.]{.underline}

"Our base case is that the escalation is temporary, but we would readily
admit that the uncertainty is high with regard to how trade talks could
evolve."

"The impact on global growth is non-linear -- the risks are firmly
skewed to the downside and the window for resolution is narrowing."

#### Econ decline causes global wars 

**[Liu 18]{.underline}** Qian Liu, China-based economist. "From economic
crisis to World War III." Project Syndicate. 11/8/2018.
<https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-crisis-military-conflict-or-structural-reform-by-qian-liu-2018-11>

The next economic crisis is closer than you think. But what you should
really worry about is what comes after: **[in the current social,
political, and technological landscape[, a prolonged economic
crisis]{.mark}, combined with rising income inequality,
[could]{.mark}]{.underline}** well [**[escalate into a major global
military conflict]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

**[The]{.underline}** 20**[08]{.underline}**-09 global financial
**[crisis almost bankrupted governments and caused systemic
collapse]{.underline}**. **[Policymakers managed to pull the global
economy back]{.underline}** from the brink, **[using massive monetary
stimulus, including]{.underline}** **[q]{.underline}**uantitative
**[e]{.underline}**asing **[and]{.underline}**
near-**[zero]{.underline}** (**[or even negative]{.underline}**)
interest **[rates]{.underline}**.

But monetary stimulus is like an adrenaline shot to jump-start an
arrested heart; it can revive the patient, but it does nothing to cure
the disease. Treating a sick economy requires structural reforms, which
can cover everything from financial and labour markets to tax systems,
fertility patterns, and education policies.

Policymakers have utterly failed to pursue such reforms, despite
promising to do so. Instead, they have remained preoccupied with
politics. From Italy to Germany, forming and sustaining governments now
seems to take more time than actual governing. Greece, for example, has
relied on money from international creditors to keep its head (barely)
above water, rather than genuinely reforming its pension system or
improving its business environment.

The lack of structural reform has meant that the unprecedented excess
liquidity that central banks injected into their economies was not
allocated to its most efficient uses. Instead, it raised global asset
prices to levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008.

In the United States, housing prices are now 8% higher than they were at
the peak of the property bubble in 2006, according to the property
website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which measures
whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is now higher
than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great Depression in
1929.

As monetary tightening reveals the vulnerabilities in the real economy,
the collapse of asset-price bubbles will trigger another economic crisis
-- one that could be even more severe than the last, because we have
built up a tolerance to our strongest macroeconomic medications. A
decade of regular adrenaline shots, in the form of ultra-low interest
rates and unconventional monetary policies, has severely depleted their
power to stabilise and stimulate the economy.

If history is any guide, **[the consequences of this mistake could
extend far beyond the economy]{.underline}**. **[According to
Harvard's]{.underline}** **[Benjamin Friedman, prolonged [periods of
economic distress have been characterised]{.mark}]{.underline}** also
**[[by public antipathy toward minority groups or foreign countries
--]{.mark} attitudes that can help to fuel
[unrest]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[or even]{.underline}** **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

For example, **[during the Great Depression]{.underline}**, US President
Herbert **[Hoover signed]{.underline}** the 1930
**[Smoot-Hawley]{.underline}** Tariff Act, intended to protect American
workers and farmers from foreign competition. In the subsequent five
years, global trade shrank by two-thirds. **[Within a decade, World War
II had begun]{.underline}**.

To be sure, WWII, like World War I, was caused by a multitude of
factors; there is no standard path to war. But there is reason to
believe that high levels of inequality can play a significant role in
stoking conflict.

**[According to research by]{.underline}** the economist Thomas
**[Piketty, a spike in income inequality is often followed by a great
crisis]{.underline}**. Income inequality then declines for a while,
before rising again, until a new peak -- and a new disaster. Though
causality has yet to be proven, given the limited number of data points,
this correlation should not be taken lightly, especially with wealth and
income inequality at historically high levels.

This is all the more worrying in view of the numerous other factors
stoking social unrest and diplomatic tension, including technological
disruption, a record-breaking migration crisis, anxiety over
globalisation, political polarisation, and rising nationalism. All are
symptoms of failed policies that could turn out to be trigger points for
a future crisis.

Voters have good reason to be frustrated, but the **[emotionally
appealing populists]{.underline}** to whom they are increasingly giving
their support are offering ill-advised solutions that **[will only make
matters worse]{.underline}**. For example, **[despite the world's
unprecedented interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being
eschewed]{.underline}**, as countries -- most notably, Donald J.
**[Trump's US -- pursue unilateral, isolationist
policies]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, **[proxy wars are raging in Syria
and Yemen]{.underline}**.

Against this background, **[we must take seriously the possibility that
[the next economic crisis could lead to a large-scale military
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By the logic of the political
scientist Samuel Huntington, considering such a scenario could help us
avoid it because it would force us to take action. In this case, the key
will be for policymakers to pursue the structural reforms that they have
long promised while replacing finger-pointing and antagonism with a
sensible and respectful global dialogue. The alternative may well be
global conflagration.

In the United States, support for a cooperative relationship with China
is evaporating fast. I increasingly hear frustration from business
leaders about structural trade issues. The military is concerned about
aggressive geopolitical moves by Beijing. And prominent voices in both
political parties are striking an increasingly confrontational tone.
Legitimate concerns have led to a vicious cycle, with each negative
development further poisoning an already shallow well of good will.

The cycle has to be reversed. In the United States, the business
community, policy analysts and the media should create a climate that
encourages elected officials to pursue a constructive relationship. The
same is true in China, albeit in a different political system. Leaders
in both countries should recognize our imperative self-interest in
working together on hugely consequential transnational issues,
especially two threats to life on earth as we know it: nuclear weapons
and climate change.

[[No single country can tackle these threats alone, and]{.mark} existing
[international institutions have proved inadequate]{.mark}. [The best
chance for successfully dealing with these]{.mark} overarching
[issues]{.mark} --- as well as other transnational issues like
pandemics, terrorism and cybersecurity --- [is]{.mark} for [the world's
two largest national economies]{.mark} to [catalyze global
action]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In a conversation, I recently led at the Council on Foreign Relations,
the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, alluded to this, remarking that
"history will remember those who took the lead in the mist."

[[The surest way]{.mark} for that to happen [is to forge a constructive
relationship between our two countries]{.mark}. Absent that, it is
imperative that we put our differences aside to tackle these two
existential challenges.]{.underline}

[As the two largest economies, [the United States and China]{.mark} can
[set the tone for a global effort against climate change by investing in
clean-energy technology, adopting strict environmental rules and

### 2AC -- AI

#### Preventing an arms race is contingent on US-China relations -- Taiwan concession locks in relations

**[Thompson and Bremmer 18]{.underline}** NICHOLAS THOMPSON AND IAN
BREMMER, Wired, 10-23-2018 "The AI Cold War that Threatens us All",
<https://www.wired.com/story/ai-cold-war-china-could-doom-us-all/>
Lowell-SB

In the original Cold War, two ideological foes created rival
geopolitical blocs that were effectively non-interoperable. The US was
boxed out of the Soviet bloc, and vice versa. The same could easily
happen again, to disastrous effect. A new cold war that gradually
isolates the Chinese and American tech sectors from each other would
starve the US of much of the fuel it now relies on for innovation:
American companies depend heavily on the Chinese market for their
profits and for engineering and software talent. At the same time, it
could actually create the kinds of dangers that hawks warn about now: It
would increase the risk that one side could surprise the other with a
decisive strategic breakthrough in AI or quantum computing.

**[Right now, maintaining a degree of openness with China is the best
defense against the growth of a techno-­authoritarian bloc. That's not
the way American leaders are headed, though.]{.underline}**

A little over six months after Donald Trump's inauguration---and his
invocation of "American carnage"---the administration launched a
sweeping investigation into China's trade practices and alleged theft of
US technology via cyberspace. That investigation has mushroomed into a
steadily escalating trade war, with the US launching tariffs on billions
of dollars of Chinese goods and new investment and export restrictions
on technologies that China considers key to AI and to its advanced
manufacturing ambitions.

**[For US security hawks, the prospect that China might dominate both 5G
and AI is a nightmare scenario.]{.underline}**

**[The confrontation is about much more than trade. The Trump
administration has made it official US policy to protect the "national
security innovation base"---White House shorthand for America's leading
technology and talent---from China and other foreign economic
predators.]{.underline}** In January, Axios published a leaked White
House presentation that recommended the US work with its allies to build
a 5G network that excludes China, to prevent Beijing from grabbing "the
commanding heights of the information domain." The presentation likened
the 21st-century struggle for data dominance to the WWII-era race to
construct an atom bomb. Then in April, **[the US Commerce Department hit
ZTE, a leading Chinese telecommunications equipment firm that was
gearing up to work on China's 5G network, with a seven-year ban on doing
business with US suppliers; the department said ZTE had violated the
terms of a sanctions settlement.]{.underline}** (The US later lifted the
ban.)

For US security hawks, the prospect that China might dominate both 5G
and AI is a nightmare scenario. At the same time, **[Washington's
escalating pushback against China's tech ambitions has made Xi even more
determined to wean his country off Western technology.]{.underline}**

**[This is a very different philosophy from the one that has guided the
technology sector for 30 years, which has favored deeply enmeshed
hardware and software supply chains. Shortly before Trump's
inauguration, Jack Ma, the chair of Alibaba, pledged to create a million
jobs in the United States.]{.underline}** By September 2018, he was
forced to admit that the offer was off the table, another casualty in
the growing list of companies and projects that are now unthinkable.

[Global work in AI has long taken place in three spheres: research
departments, corporations, and the military. The first sphere has always
been marked by openness and cooperation; to a lesser extent, so has the
second. Academics freely share their work.]{.underline} Microsoft has
trained many of China's best AI researchers and helped nurture many
promising AI startups, and Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent employ US
engineers at their research hubs in Silicon Valley and Seattle. An
AI-driven breakthrough in Shanghai---say, in diagnosing disease through
more accurate scans of medical images---can save lives in Shawnee. But
national security concerns have a way of overriding commercial
considerations. For now, the political momentum appears to be driving
the two countries' tech sectors apart to such a degree that even
collaboration between researchers and corporations could be stifled. The
schism could well define how the struggle between democracy and
authoritarianism plays out.

[IMAGINE IT'S 2022: America's confrontational economic policies have
continued, and China has refused to yield. Huawei and ZTE have been
banned from the networks of the US and key Western allies]{.underline}.
Through investment and theft, Beijing has reduced its reliance on US
semiconductors. Rival tech superpowers have failed to develop common
standards. US and Chinese academics increasingly deposit their
cutting-edge AI research in government safes instead of sharing it at
international conferences. **[Other countries---like France and
Russia---have tried to build homegrown technology industries centered on
AI, but they lag far behind]{.underline}**.

[The world's nations can commit to American technology: buying Apple
phones, using Google search, driving Teslas, and managing a fleet of
personal robots made by a startup in Seattle. Or they can commit to
China]{.underline}: using the equivalents built by Alibaba and Tencent,
connecting through the 5G network constructed by Huawei and ZTE, and
driving autonomous cars built by Baidu. The choice is a fraught one. If
you are a poor country that lacks the capacity to build your own data
network, you're going to feel loyalty to whoever helps lay the pipes at
low cost. It will all seem uncomfortably close to the arms and security
pacts that defined the Cold War.

And we may be seeing the first evidence of this. In May 2018, about six
months after Zimbabwe finally got rid of the despot Robert Mugabe, the
new government announced that it was partnering with a Chinese company
called CloudWalk to build an AI and facial-recognition system. Zimbabwe
gets to expand its surveillance state. China gets money, influence, and
data. In July, nearly 700 dignitaries from China and Pakistan gathered
in Islamabad to celebrate the completion of the Pak-China Optical Fibre
Cable, a 500-mile-long data line connecting the two countries through
the Karakoram Mountains, built by Huawei and financed with a loan from
China's Export-Import Bank. Documents obtained by Pakistan's Dawn
newspaper revealed a future plan for high-speed fiber to help wire up
cities across Pakistan with surveillance cameras and vehicle-monitoring
systems, part of a "Safe Cities" initiative launched in 2016 with help
from Huawei and other Chinese firms. China has effectively constructed
its own Marshall Plan, one that may, in some cases, build surveillance
states instead of democracies.

It's not hard to see the appeal for much of the world of hitching their
future to China. Today, as the West grapples with stagnant wage growth
and declining trust in core institutions, more Chinese people live in
cities, work in middle-class jobs, drive cars, and take vacations than
ever before. China's plans for a tech-driven, privacy-invading social
credit system may sound dystopian to Western ears, but it hasn't raised
much protest there. In a recent survey by the public relations
consultancy Edelman, 84 percent of Chinese respondents said they had
trust in their government. In the US, only a third of people felt that
way.

For the past century, democracies have proven more resilient and
successful than dictatorships, even if democracies have made stupid
decisions along the way.

No one can be certain what happens next. In the US, in the wake of
controversies surrounding the 2016 election and user privacy, a growing
number of Republicans and Democrats want to regulate America's tech
giants and rein them in. At the same time, China has stiffened its
resolve to become an AI superpower and export its techno-­authoritarian
revolution---which means the US has a vital national interest in
ensuring that its tech firms remain world leaders. For now, there is
nothing close to a serious debate about how to address this dilemma.

As for China, it remains unclear how much digital intrusion people there
will tolerate in the name of efficiency and social cohesion---to say
nothing of people in other countries that are tempted by Beijing's
model. Regimes that ask people to trade freedom for stability tend to
invite dissent. And Chinese growth is slowing. For the past century,
democracies have proven more resilient and successful than
dictatorships, even if democracies, particularly in an age of
algorithms, have made some stupid decisions along the way.

It is at least conceivable that Trump's aggressive policies could,
counterintuitively, lead to a rapprochement with Beijing. If Trump
threatens to take something off the table that China truly cannot afford
to lose, that could pressure Beijing to dial back its global tech
ambitions and open its domestic market to US firms. But there is another
way to influence China, one more likely to succeed: The US could try to
wrap Beijing in a technology embrace. Work with China to develop rules
and norms for the development of AI. Establish international standards
to ensure that the algorithms governing people's lives and livelihoods
are transparent and accountable. Both countries could, as Tim Hwang
suggests, commit to developing more shared, open databases for
researchers.

[But for now, at least, conflicting goals, mutual suspicion, and a
growing conviction that AI and other advanced technologies are a
winner-take-all game are pushing the two countries' tech sectors further
apart. A permanent cleavage will come at a steep cost and will only give
techno-authoritarianism more room to grow.]{.underline}

#### Relations key to prevent AI prolif -- otherwise causes extinction

Critics of a new treaty on fully autonomous weapons often assert that
"existing principles of international law are sufficient to circumscribe
the use of these weapons."\[114\] They argue that any problematic use of
fully autonomous weapons would already be unlawful because it would
violate current international humanitarian law. According to two
authors, "The question for the legal community \[would be\] whether
autonomous weapon systems comply with the legal norms that States have
put in place."\[115\] [Recognizing that the weapons raise new concerns,
another author notes that "as cases and mistakes arise, the lawyers and
injured parties will have to creatively navigate the network of legal
mechanisms \[available in international law\]," but he too concludes
that a new legal instrument would be unnecessary]{.underline}.\[116\]
**[Existing international humanitarian law, however, was not intended to
and cannot adequately address the issues raised by this revolutionary
type of weapon. Therefore, it should be supplemented with a new treaty
establishing a ban.]{.underline}**

[A new international treaty would clarify states' obligations and make
explicit the requirements for compliance. It would minimize questions
about legality by standardizing rules across countries and reducing the
need for case-by-case determinations]{.underline}. Greater legal clarity
would lead to more effective enforcement because countries would better
understand the rules. A ban convention would make the illegality of
fully autonomous weapons clear even for countries that do not conduct
legal reviews of new or modified weapons (see Contention #10). Finally,
[many states that did not join the new treaty would still be apt to
abide by its ban because of the stigma associated with the
weapons.]{.underline}

[A treaty dedicated to fully autonomous weapons could also address
aspects of proliferation not covered under traditional international
humanitarian law, which focuses on the use of weapons in
war]{.underline}. In particular, such an instrument could prohibit
development and production. Eliminating these activities would prevent
the spread of fully autonomous weapons, including to states or non-state
actors with little regard for international humanitarian law or limited
ability to enforce compliance. In addition, it would help avert an arms
race by stopping development before it went too far (see Contention #8).

Finally[, new law could address concerns about an accountability gap
(see Contention #3). A treaty that banned fully autonomous weapons under
any circumstances could require that anyone violating that rule be held
responsible for the weapon's actions.]{.underline}

[While international humanitarian law already sets limits on problematic
weapons and their use, responsible governments have in the past found it
necessary to supplement existing legal frameworks for weapons that by
their nature pose significant humanitarian threats]{.underline}.
Treaties dedicated to specific weapons types exist for cluster
munitions, antipersonnel mines, blinding lasers, chemical weapons, and
biological weapons. Fully autonomous weapons have the potential to raise
a comparable or even higher level of humanitarian concern and thus
should be the subject of similar supplementary international law.

Upon the second anniversary of the election of Taiwan President Tsai
Ing-wen, it is worth taking stock of whether the People\'s Republic of
China\'s (PRC) initial fears of Tsai\'s political intentions have panned
out. As I observed at roughly the one-year mark, [[Chinese leaders
have]{.mark} ample [reason to feel good about Taiwan,]{.mark} namely
[because Tsai]{.mark} had been focusing her energy on stabilizing
cross-Strait relations based on the status quo rather than moving toward
independence. This trend has only continued, undermining Beijing\'s
rationale for ratcheting up pressure against the island
nation]{.underline}. China, however, has ramped up its coercive efforts,
prompting questions about Beijing\'s intentions and the long-term
stability of cross-Strait **[relations. [Beijing]{.mark} should
[recognize that Tsai is i]{.mark}ndeed [a moderate,]{.mark} and China
will be hard-pressed to find a more reliable and stable Taiwanese leader
in the future. And yet, Beijing is harming relations with Taiwan under
Tsai through its actions.]{.underline}**

Over the past year[, [Tsai]{.mark} has proactively endeavored to
[negotiate]{.mark} a practical workaround to her endorsement of the
so-called "1992 Consensus", a concept that acknowledges the existence of
only "one China," but allows each side to interpret what that
means.]{.underline} Tsai has recognized "the historical fact" of the
consensus, though not the agreement\'s exact wording, in order to
preserve Taiwan\'s de facto sovereignty. Tsai\'s decision has fueled
Chinese suspicions of her. In the late 1990s, Tsai assisted
then-President Lee Teng-hui in crafting the "special state-to-state"
formulation for cross-Strait ties. When Tsai was running for the
presidency in 2012, she explicitly rejected the "1992 Consensus".

[Nevertheless, the first two years of [Tsai\'s presidency]{.mark} have
[demonstrated]{.mark} that [she prioritizes caution, pragmatism
and,]{.mark} most importantly, [transparency]{.mark}, in dealing with
China]{.underline}. Most notably, Tsai has reached out in a show of
"goodwill" to engage Beijing on establishing a new model of cross-Strait
relations. In a speech in August, Tsai said that "we hope that both
sides of the Taiwan Strait can work on a new model for cross-Strait
interactions that benefit the stability and prosperity of both sides and
the region as a whole." Tsai\'s remark was immediately panned in
Beijing, with China\'s Taiwan Affairs Office accusing the Tsai
administration of attempting to "de-Sinicize," or eliminate Chinese
influence over, Taiwan. One mainland scholar added that the "1992
Consensus" already exists so "why bother to find a new model if the
existing one works fine?"

Prior to China\'s 19th Party Congress in early October, Tsai reiterated
her administration\'s desire to engage Beijing on cross-Strait
stability. However, Chinese President Xi Jinping refused to give an inch
during his marathon speech at the congress, forcefully stating that "we
have firm will, full confidence and sufficient capability to defeat any
form of Taiwan independence secession plot." [According to Taiwan expert
Richard C. Bush, Xi\'s language was the toughest observed yet of any
Chinese leader when dealing with the independence-leaning Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) in Taiwan]{.underline}. This impasse may have
hurt Tsai politically. Polling analysis from October 2017 indicates the
percentage of Taiwanese who believe she is performing well on China
policy dropped from about 50 percent in 2016 to about 35 percent in
2017. Tsai\'s falling approval rating on cross-Strait relations may be
seen as a positive development for Beijing since past polls have
consistently shown that most Taiwanese do not seek conflict with China.

**[Thornton 5]{.underline}**

(Richard Thornton, professor of history and International Affairs at
George Washington University in Washington, D.C., *The Reagan Revolution
II: Rebuilding the Western Alliance*, pgs. 311-313)

The Chinese delayed final agreement to almost the last minute because of
their refusal to drop their demand for a date certain for termination of
arms sales and to accept an explicit linkage of the two conditions which
the United States had insisted upon since 1978---Chinese commitment to
the peaceful settlement of the dispute with Taiwan and agreement to
permit the United States to continue to sell arms to the island.
However, when the State Department cabled the administration's "final
draft" to the Chinese on August 15, they accepted within twenty-four
hours.

Last-minute creative drafting brought the Chinese to final agreement on
the 17^th^. The crux of the nine-paragraph communiqué was a quid pro quo
found in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6. In paragraph 4, the Chinese government
declared its "fundamental policy to strive for a peaceful solution to
the Taiwan question." The "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan," of January
1, 1979 promulgated the policy of "striving for peaceful reunification
of the motherland," and the nine-point proposal of September 30, 1981
reaffirmed it.

Paragraph 5 contained the diluted connection to the quid pro quo. It
stated that the United States government "understands and appreciates
the Chinese policy of striving for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan
question." (The Chinese refused to accept the U.S. term "peaceful
settlement," insisting upon "peaceful resolution," instead.) Then,
paragraph 6 completed the "if-then" relationship. "Having in mind the
foregoing statements...the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[Government]{.underline}** states that it
does not seek to carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan."

> Its **[[arms sales to Taiwan]{.mark} will not exceed]{.underline}**,
> either **[in qualitative or quantitative terms, the level of those
> supplied in recent years]{.underline}** since the establishment of
> diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and that
> **[it intends to reduce gradually]{.underline}** **[its sales of arms
> to Taiwan]{.underline}**, leading over a period of time to a final
> resolution.

The implicit quid pro quo was that as long as the Chinese pursued a
policy of peaceful settlement the United States would gradually reduce
sales of arms to Taiwan. In testimony before Congress the next day,
Holdridge made explicit that China's failure to adhere to its commitment
would absolve the United States from its side of the bargain.
Brandishing a figurative sword of Damocles over Beijing's head, he said:
"the administration would reconsider its refusal to sell advanced F-16
jets to Taipei if China goes back on its 'fundamental policy' of dealing
peacefully with Taiwan."

Finally, U.S. negotiators qualified all of the concessions Haig had
unilaterally extended to China. **[While the United States agreed to
reduce arms sales]{.underline}** **[it did not stipulate a time
frame]{.underline}**, **[nor a terminal date]{.underline}**, as Haig had
urged and the Chinese demanded. **[Negotiators]{.underline}** also
**[made clear that]{.underline}** the term **["reduce
gradually"]{.underline}** **[did not bind the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to a year-after-year reduction, but only to
gradual reduction over time, which could mean an increase in any one
year over the previous year]{.underline}**. **[The Chinese had wanted
the term "[progressive reduction."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[**[The quantity/quality limitation]{.underline}** Haig had extended
**[was]{.underline}** also **[reinterpreted]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to
mean]{.underline}** that **[the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[would replace obsolete equipment
and technology with its nearest equivalent]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
modern replacements, effectively eliminating any advantage the Chinese
might obtain through obsolescence. Finally, the highest level of the
Carter administration's sales to Taiwan had been \$835 million in 1982
dollars, which established a reasonably high starting point from which
to calculate "reductions."

8\. [Global ethics must respond to mass extinction]{.underline}. In late
2014, the Worldwide Fund for Nature reported a startling statistic:
according to their global study, 52% of species had gone extinct between
1970 and 2010.60 This is not news: [for three decades, conservation
biologists have been warning of a 'sixth mass extinction', which, by
definition, could eliminate more than three quarters of currently
existing life forms in just a few centuries]{.underline}.61 In other
words, [it could threaten the practical possibility of the survival of
earthly life. Mass [extinction]{.mark} is not simply extinction (or
death) writ large]{.underline}: **[it [is a qualitatively different
phenomena that demands its own ethical
categories]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [It cannot be grasped by aggregating
species extinctions,]{.underline} let alone the deaths of individual
organisms. [[Not only does it erase]{.mark} diverse, irreplaceable life
forms]{.underline}, [their **unique [histories]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**open-ended [possibilities]{.mark}**[, but it **threatens the
ontological conditions of**]{.mark} **Earthly
[life]{.mark}**.]{.underline} IR is one of few disciplines that is
explicitly devoted to the pursuit of survival, yet it has almost nothing
to say in the face of a possible mass extinction event.62 It utterly
lacks the conceptual and ethical frameworks necessary to foster diverse,
meaningful responses to this phenomenon. As mentioned above, [Cold-War
era concepts such as 'nuclear winter' and 'omnicide' gesture towards
harms massive in their scale and moral horror]{.underline}. However,
[they are asymptotic: [they imagine]{.mark} nightmares of [a]{.mark}
severely [denuded planet, yet]{.mark} they do [not]{.mark} contemplate
[the **comprehensive negation** that]{.mark} a mass [extinction]{.mark}
event [entails]{.mark}.]{.underline} In contemporary IR discourses,
where it appears at all, extinction is treated as a problem of
scientific management and biopolitical control aimed at securing
existing human lifestyles.63 Once again, [[this]{.mark} approach [fails
to recognise]{.mark} the reality of [extinction]{.mark}, which [is a
**matter of being and nonbeing**, not one of life and death]{.mark}
processes. Confronting the enormity of a possible mass extinction event
requires a total overhaul of human perceptions of what is at stake in
the disruption of the conditions of Earthly life. The question of what
is 'lost' in extinction has]{.underline}, since the inception of the
concept of 'conservation', [been addressed in terms of financial
cost]{.underline} and economic liabilities.64 Beyond reducing life to
forms to capital, currencies and financial instruments, the dominant
neoliberal political economy of conservation imposes a homogenising,
Western secular worldview on a planetary phenomenon. [Yet the
**enormity, complexity, and scale** of mass extinction is so huge that
[humans need to **draw on every**]{.mark} **possible [resource]{.mark}
in order [to]{.mark} find ways of [respond]{.mark}ing**.]{.underline}
This means that they need to mobilise multiple worldviews and lifeways
-- including those emerging from indigenous and marginalised
cosmologies. Above all, [it is crucial and urgent to realise that
extinction is a **matter of global ethics**]{.underline}. [It is not
simply an issue of management or security, or even of particular visions
of the good life]{.underline}. [Instead, it is about staking a claim as
to the goodness of life itself. If it does not fit within the existing
parameters of global ethics, then it is these boundaries that need to
change]{.underline}.

surprising that there is currently a resurgence, in \[\*850\]
international law, of the old debate between ultraliberals, who express
discontentment with too much law and bureaucracy, and moderate liberals,
whose sole intent is to reform the system. Yet restoring the image of a
classical but incentive-creating system would be inconsistent with the
profound socio-cultural changes the contemporary international system
has undergone, and with the legitimate aspirations held by millions of
individuals, is therefore not an option either. The shift toward ethical
and functionalist welfare-inducing law is the product of a redefinition
of politics and of the fabric of international society itself, and is
accompanying the evolution of this society and structuring it
accordingly. Classical society and liberal international law were based
on international politics as defined solely by States. Contemporary
welfare-inducing society presupposes that political power must aim at
fostering communal wellbeing around the planet. But the 1945 consensus
deteriorated long ago, as it was borne out of exceptional circumstances.
It now needs to be reconstituted in the context of the new society. The
legal values and objectives contemporary international law aspires to
correspond to political priorities and certainly do not flow from a
universal consciousness. They are the result of choices that were quite
understandable in 1945, but that now need to be reformulated or revoked
outright, as even if the same objectives undoubtedly still remain, the
modalities have changed and the circle of addressees has become
considerably larger. n95 Some have represented current phenomena in the
international system as the result of a \"crisis of authority\" related
to a double crisis of State sovereignty and of territoriality. n96 This
is deemed to explain the inability of international law to regulate the
current disorder and to create a stable order. However, just as one
refers to a \"global inversion\" to describe the diminishing of
sovereignties faced with emancipated groups and individuals, one could
equally refer to an \"inversion of international law\" since this **[law
is increasingly restraining States and empowering
individuals]{.underline}**, minorities, and peoples
**[through]{.underline}** the recognition of **[rights]{.underline}**.
This approach is said to be based on \"the actor getting his own back on
the system.\" n97 States are no longer the sole members, actors, and
subjects of international society, and individuals and NGOs are now
seeking recognition under international law. **[Today, [there are
hundreds of international organizations]{.mark}, thousands of
NGOs]{.underline}** - including 2,719 with ECOSOC status - **[and
hundreds of multinationals]{.underline}** \[\*851\] thriving in the 208
States and territories. These are the entities with which States,
international organizations, and international politicians interact, n98
**[[which is why]{.underline}]{.mark}** political **[cohesion and [the
legitimacy of the existing system require that]{.mark}]{.underline}**
all **[[actors adhere to shared values]{.underline}]{.mark}**. n99 All
could be different if there were greater consciousness of the fact that
a legal system can be used beneficially and not simply endured
passively. That being said, one should not minimize the role played by
States, and should acknowledge the amicable concurrence of interstatists
and cosmopolitans, voluntarists, and communitarians. This is not to put
in question the principle of interventionist welfare-inducing law, but
rather to question its functioning and the limits to which it should be
subject. This may appear surprising and perhaps even shocking
considering the sociological state of the planet with all its
inequalities and injustices, where collective and individual suffering
has never been as dramatic and devastating. The neo-Marxist economists
Etienne Balibar and Immanuel Wallerstein have illustrated how major
conflicts of interest, monopolist and exclusionary phenomena, and the
unequal development of powers have persisted due to an excess of unequal
resistance from the periphery. n100 But this is precisely what has
prompted the present essay, since **[the solution might]{.underline}**
actually **[lie in subjecting law to]{.underline}** certain **[limits.
[I]{.mark}nternational [law may be \"]{.mark}part of [the
problem]{.mark},\" [but it is]{.mark} also]{.underline}**, as has been
emphasised by Philippe Sands, n101 \"**[part of [the
solution]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" so long as possible options do not go
to the detriment of social or political processes or the will of the
State. Without returning to classical minimalist law, we need to fight
the preconception that reducing law is equivalent to regression, and
that any limitation on sovereignty is a victory. How far should
international law go in accomplishing its aims? **[Is it the miracle
solution to all]{.underline}** of the world\'s
**[problems?]{.underline}** The answer is obviously
**[no]{.underline}**. **[Law is not a universal panacea]{.underline}**.
Politics determine international law, even if sometimes they appear to
ignore it. Any discourse that glorifies international law and its
virtues is usually \[\*852\] accompanied by criticism of its weaknesses
and perverse effects. This anthropomorphic vision of international law
has the aim of turning it into a being in its own right that can be
conveniently accused of defaults that are in fact those of the entities
that created it, i.e. principally States, politicians, international
experts such as us international jurists, but also those who would like
to appropriate international law, such as NGOs, lobbies,
individuals/associations, think tanks, and multinational corporations,
which undoubtedly exercise political power despite hesitating to
acknowledge it openly. This anthropomorphic vision needs to be rejected
so that everyone can be allocated their proper role and usefulness. In
fact, the present situation is interesting in that it reveals the
functioning of western political modernity and its tendency to isolate
the legal dimension in order to attribute an exclusive and exorbitant
role to it. Yet the difficulties and tensions that have resulted
illustrate the necessity of re-evaluating the two other dimensions to
which international law is fundamentally connected: the political and
the social. No doubt it is therefore necessary to search for a better
balance, or more precisely, to be more conscious of the political and
social dimensions that are concealed behind the law, and which are
masked by the heightened role of all that is legal. They no longer have
the same mobilizing effect they used to have, at least less than is the
case of, say, legal discourse on human rights. Law does not actually
provide a response to all problems, even if law is now omnipresent. In
fact, the merit of contemporary deconstructivist critique is to have
deconstructed the illusion of complete legal emancipation and to have
attempted to rehabilitate all that is purely political in the
elaboration, interpretation, and application of rules; and it is
undoubtedly this critique that will enable us to accept that
international law can regain strength as a political means of regulating
conduct. n102 What thus takes place behind the smokescreen of
welfare-inducing law is a political game of inclusion and exclusion. Why
has poverty not been eliminated as proclaimed? Is it because law has
remained ineffective and impotent when faced with international reality?
Or is it merely a tree concealing a forest of international
renouncement? Reducing world poverty is a commensurable challenge and
therefore a realizable objective, but it will not be possible as long as
States and other actors have not set themselves truly fundamental and
overriding aims for the benefit of the planet, as well as for their own
domestic systems. \"Poverty is an invention of civilisation,\" n103 and
it is on the latter that its eradication will depend. Studies on the
phenomenon of poverty are very interesting in \[\*853\] this respect,
because they show that at a given moment in the development of a
society, poverty always calls for collective action (and not individual
acts of charity). No sooner are substantial amounts of property
constituted that give rise to inequalities and merciless confrontation
between the rich and the poor, do \"asymmetrical dependencies\" appear
as the most frequent result. n104 The possible defaults and dysfunctions
of welfare-inducing law should not mask political deferral and inaction
at the domestic and international levels, or the fact that international
law has always been used in a profoundly ambiguous way: as a positive
model of inclusion and simultaneously as a negative model of exclusion,
as a positive model of cooperation yet also as a negative model of
domination. The somewhat paradoxical yet inescapable fact is that
welfare-inducing law is, as we have seen, easier to instrumentalize than
strictly liberal law aimed at regulating conduct, and is thus,
ironically, less social and more unjust. It can be used to accelerate
necessary corrections to gaping inequalities between nations or between
individuals, but can also enable superpowers and economic operators to
increase their revenue and importance. Furthermore, it can be
conveniently denounced by the most virulent dictatorships in
underdeveloped countries on the basis that it is inefficient. It can
also be used as a means of obtaining international aid, despite the fact
that the sharp rise in poverty and famine over recent years has actually
been due to negligence, blind collectivism, terror, or civil war. n105
Here, legal interventionist and welfare-orientated discourse can be a
vector of domestic or international domination, much like a powerful
lever of transformation. It should also be noted that strictly legal
discourse will not tell us why things are as they are and which might be
the best way to change them. That is not its role, and it is therefore
not a problem if law does not trump other types of discourse. **[[Law
has]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[become so entrenched in
international society that the latter can no longer be conceptualized
independently]{.underline}]{.mark}** of it. Although it has undoubtedly
always been an instrument of international social and political action,
**[law has never played as important a role as it does
today]{.underline}**. **[International legal problems are no longer
external problems one can]{.underline}** simply **[resolve by
calling]{.underline}** international **[State
conferences]{.underline}**; they have become internalized by all
societies, **[and we are]{.underline}** gradually **[losing our ability
to distance ourselves]{.underline}** from them, and indeed from law
itself. Yet distinguishing roles and finalities is all the more
difficult when law is not in \[\*854\] itself capable of effectuating
change and remains dependent on politics and adaptation. The debate on
the ability of politics to bring about change on an international level
is as old as international society itself, and its current prevalence
indicates its re-emergence. Although many analysts have taken
neo-realist, neo-institutionalist, neo-functionalist, globalizationist,
or transnationalist positions on this issue, n106 the present trend
emphasises that the scope for manoeuvre of \"real international
politics\" is limited due to the rise in bureaucracy, corporate interest
groups, legalism in international relations, transnational networks of
private actors, the incapacities of fragile States, etc., as if there
existed within a decentralized society (which, however, has never been
centralized and thus cannot be decentralized) a sort of political
center-point providing a measure of the effectiveness or legitimacy of
international political action, n107 when in reality the concepts most
often evoked - namely collective State action, \"international
regimes,\" or global governance n108 - actually only recentralize
politics in different manners. n109 Should we perhaps nuance the idea of
an international political \"center\" or \"system,\" either
pessimistically by reference to a new Middle Age, n110 or more
optimistically by emphasizing the importance of the individual\'s new
role as an international actor, n111 the emergence of networks, or of
orderly pluralism, n112 in order to enlarge our perspective on politics
and better understand it? In fact, the increasing relevance of
international law is not putting limitations on power, but bringing
about a reorganization of power. The impression of reduced political
leeway is thus deceptive, since in fact, new political powers are
emerging that involve decisions affecting people and their environment.
The sensation of political powerlessness or of simulacrum derives from
\[\*855\] the fact that politics are reduced to the activities carried
out within the official international political system. n113 However,
whatever is the actual scale of these illusions and developments, they
have instilled a sense of unease in internationalist culture, which is
necessarily political as well as legal given the indissoluble links
between the two. This is the result of the latent but visible state of
disequilibrium between the official appearance of the classical
center-points of political power - States, international organizations,
etc. - where official activities appear efficient and regulatory, but
often fall short of attaining the fixed objectives, and an international
society that is inexorably straying from official political decisions
and introducing new actors with new objectives, decision-making
competencies, and political dimensions. That is not to say that States
and international organizations are not the prime institutional actors
on the international scene, but simply that behind the unchanged facade
of the politics they engage in, new political centre-points are taking
shape. Consequently, the boundary between the political and the
non-political is becoming ever more indeterminate, just as the boundary
between the legal and the non-legal. To paraphrase Prosper Weil, one can
say that politics, much as the law, have become \"diluted.\" The
categories of the political and the non-political, as well as those of
the legal and non-legal, must be re-conceptualized with a view to
redefining political priorities and redefining them collectively, to the
extent that this is possible. How can welfare-inducing law prevail
without a strong and interventionist political center-point to ensure
its application as the European States did in the post-war period from
the fifties to seventies? How can one reconcile the changes in the law
and international politics? Is not what initially seemed paradoxical but
explicable becoming completely contradictory? In any case, there is
little point in pinning all our hopes on politics. Welfare does not seem
to be induced by politics, by the law or by the State, although we have
not altogether reached a dead point. n114 **[[International

(Andrew, The New American Militarism, p205-210)

There is, wrote H. L. Mencken, "always a well-known solution to every
human problem---neat, plausible, and wrong."1 Mencken's aphorism applies
in spades to the subject of this account. **[[To
imagine]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[there exists a simple antidote
to the "military metaphysic"]{.underline}]{.mark}** to which the people
and government of the United States have fallen prey **[[is to
misconstrue the problem]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As the foregoing
chapters make plain, the origins of America's present-day infatuation
with military power are anything but simple. American **[[militarism is
not the invention of a cabal nursing fantasies of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
global **[[empire]{.underline}]{.mark}** and manipulating an
unsuspecting people frightened by the events of 9/11. Further, it is
counterproductive to think in these terms--- to assign culpability to a
particular president or administration and to imagine that throwing the
bums out will put things right. Yet neither does the present-day status
of the United States as sole superpower reveal an essential truth,
whether positive or negative, about the American project. Enthusiasts
(mostly on the right) who interpret America's possession of unrivaled
and unprecedented armed might as proof that the United States enjoys the
mandate of heaven are deluded. But so too are those (mostly on the left)
who see in the far-flung doings of today's U.S. military establishment
substantiation of Major General Smedley Butler's old chestnut that "war
is just a racket" and the American soldier "a gangster for capitalism"
sent abroad to do the bidding of Big Business or Big Oil.2
**[[Neither]{.underline}]{.mark}** the will of **[[God
nor]{.underline}]{.mark}** the venality of **[[Wall
Street]{.underline}]{.mark}** suffices to
**[[explain]{.underline}]{.mark}** how the United States managed to
become stuck in World **[[War]{.underline}]{.mark}** IV. Rather, the new
American **[[militarism is a]{.underline}]{.mark}** little like
pollution---the perhaps unintended, but **[[foreseeable by-product
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** prior choices and **[[decisions made without
taking fully into account the full range of costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**
likely to be incurred. In making the industrial revolution, the captains
of American enterprise did not consciously set out to foul the
environment, but as they harnessed the waters, crisscrossed the nation
with rails, and built their mills and refineries, negative consequences
ensued. Lakes and rivers became choked with refuse, the soil
contaminated, and the air in American cities filthy. By the time that
the industrial age approached its zenith in the middle of the twentieth
century, most Americans had come to take this for granted; a degraded
environment seemed the price you had to pay in exchange for material
abundance and by extension for freedom and opportunity. Americans might
not like pollution, but there seemed to be no choice except to put up
with it. To appreciate that this was, in fact, not the case, Americans
needed a different consciousness. This is where the environmental
movement, beginning more or less in the 1960s, made its essential
contribution. Environmentalists enabled Americans to see the natural
world and their relationship to that world in a different light. They
argued that the obvious deterioration in the environment was
unacceptable and not at all inevitable. Alternatives did exist.
**[[Different policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and practices
**[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}** stanch and even
**[[reverse]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Purists]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
that movement insisted upon the primacy of environmental needs,
everywhere and in all cases. Theirs was (and is) a principled
**[[position]{.underline}]{.mark}** deserving to be heard. To act on
their recommendations, however, **[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely
**[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark}** shutting down the economy, **[[an
impractical and politically infeasible]{.mark} course of
[action]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Pragmatists]{.underline}]{.mark}** advanced a different argument.
They **[[suggested]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[it was possible to
negotiate a compromise]{.mark} [between]{.mark}]{.underline}** economic
needs and environmental **[[imperatives]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This
compromise might oblige Americans to curtail certain bad habits, but it
did not require changing the fundamentals of how they lived their lives.
Americans could keep their cars and continue their love affair with
consumption; but at the same time they could also have cleaner air and
cleaner water. Implementing this compromise has produced an outcome that
environmental radicals (and on the other side, believers in
laissez-faire capitalism) today find unsatisfactory. In practice, it
turns out, once begun negotiations never end. Bargaining is continuous,
contentious, and deeply politicized. Participants in the process seldom
come away with everything they want. Settling for half a loaf when you
covet the whole is inevitably frustrating. But the results are
self-evident. Environmental conditions in the United States today are
palpably better than they were a half century ago. Pollution has not
been vanquished, but it has become more manageable. Furthermore, the
nation has achieved those improvements without imposing on citizens
undue burdens and without preventing its entrepreneurs from innovating,
creating, and turning a profit. **[[Restoring]{.mark}]{.underline}** a
semblance of **[[balance]{.underline}]{.mark}** and good sense
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the way that Americans think about
**[[military power will require a]{.underline}]{.mark}** similarly
**[[pragmatic approach]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Undoing all of the
negative effects that result from having been seduced by war may lie
beyond reach, but Americans can at least make them more manageable and
thereby salvage their democracy. In explaining the origins of the new
American militarism, this account has not sought to assign or to impute
blame. None of the protagonists in this story sat down after Vietnam and
consciously plotted to propagate perverse attitudes toward military
power any more than Andrew Carnegie or John D. Rockefeller plotted to
despoil the nineteenth-century American landscape. The clamor after
Vietnam to rebuild the American arsenal and to restore American
self-confidence, the celebration of soldierly values, the search for
ways to make force more usable: all of these came about because groups
of Americans thought that they glimpsed in the realm of military affairs
the solution to vexing problems. The soldiers who sought to rehabilitate
their profession, the intellectuals who feared that America might share
the fate of Weimar, the strategists wrestling with the implications of
nuclear weapons, the conservative Christians appalled by the apparent
collapse of traditional morality: none of these acted out of motives
that were inherently dishonorable. To the extent that we may find fault
with the results of their efforts, that fault is more appropriately
attributable to human fallibility than to malicious intent. And yet in
the end it is not motive that matters but outcome. Several decades after
Vietnam, in the aftermath of a century filled to overflowing with
evidence pointing to the limited utility of armed force and the dangers
inherent in relying excessively on military power, the American people
have persuaded themselves that their best prospect for safety and
salvation lies with the sword. Told that despite all of their past
martial exertions, treasure expended, and lives sacrificed, the world
they inhabit is today more dangerous than ever and that they must
redouble those exertions, they dutifully assent. Much as dumping raw
sewage into American lakes and streams was once deemed unremarkable, so
today "global power projection"---a phrase whose sharp edges we have
worn down through casual use, but which implies military activism
without apparent limit---has become standard practice, a normal
condition, one to which no plausible alternatives seem to exist. All of
this Americans have come to take for granted: it's who we are and what
we do. Such a definition of normalcy cries out for a close and critical
reexamination. Surely, the surprises, disappointments, painful losses,
and woeful, even shameful failures of the Iraq War make clear the need
to rethink the fundamentals of U.S. military policy. Yet a meaningful
reexamination will require first a change of consciousness, seeing war
and America's relationship to war in a fundamentally different way. Of
course, dissenting views already exist. A rich tradition of American
pacifism abhors the resort to violence as always and in every case
wrong. Advocates of disarmament argue that by their very existence
weapons are an incitement to violence. In the former camp, there can
never be a justification for war. In the latter camp, the shortest road
to peace begins with the beating of swords into ploughshares. These are
principled views that deserve a hearing, more so today than ever. By
discomfiting the majority, advocates of such views serve the common
good. But **[[to make]{.underline}]{.mark}** full-fledged

Feminism is not dead. It is alive and well in intercollegiate debate.
Increasingly, [students rely on feminist authors to inform their
analysis of resolutions]{.underline}. While I applaud these initial
efforts to explore feminist thought, I am concerned that such arguments
only exemplify the general absence of sound causal reasoning in debate
rounds. Poor causal reasoning results from a [debate practice that
privileges empirical proof over rhetorical proof, fostering ignorance of
the subject matter being debated]{.underline}. To illustrate my point, I
claim that [debate arguments about feminists suffer from a reductionism
that tends to marginalize the voices of significant feminist
authors]{.underline}. David Zarefsky made a persuasive case for the
value of causal reasoning in intercollegiate debate as far back as 1979.
He argued that causal arguments are desirable for four reasons. First,
[causal analysis increases the control of the arguer over events by
promoting understanding of them.]{.underline} Second, [the use of causal
reasoning increases rigor of analysis and fairness in the
decision-making process.]{.underline} Third, [causal arguments promote
understanding of the philosophical paradox that presumably good people
tolerate the existence of evil.]{.underline} Finally, [causal reasoning
supplies good reasons for "commitments to policy choices or to systems
of belief which transcend whim, caprice, or the non-reflexive "claims of
immediacy]{.underline}" (117-9). [Rhetorical proof plays an important
role in the analysis of causal relationships. This is true despite the
common assumption that the identification of cause and effect relies
solely upon empirical investigation]{.underline}. For Zarefsky, there
are three types of causal reasoning. The first [type of causal reasoning
describes the application of a covering law to account for physical or
material conditions that cause a resulting event This]{.underline} type
of causal reasoning [requires empirical proof]{.underline} prominent in
scientific investigation. A [second type of causal reasoning requires
the assignment of responsibility]{.underline}. Responsible human beings
as agents cause certain events to happen; that is, [causation resides in
human beings]{.underline} (107-08). A [third type]{.underline} of causal
claim [explains the existence of a causal relationship. It functions "to
provide reasons to justify a belief that a causal connection
exists"]{.underline} (108). The second and third types of causal
arguments rely on rhetorical proof, the provision of "good reasons" to
substantiate arguments about human responsibility or explanations for
the existence of a causal relationship (108). I contend that the
practice of intercollegiate [debate privileges the first type of causal
analysis. It reduces questions of human motivation and explanation to a
level of empiricism appropriate only for causal questions concerning
physical or material conditions]{.underline}. [Arguments about
feminism]{.underline} clearly [illustrate this phenomenon.]{.underline}
Substantive [debates about feminism usually take one of two
forms]{.underline}. First, on the affirmative, [debaters argue that some
aspect of the resolution is a manifestation of patriarchy]{.underline}.
For example, given the spring 1992 resolution, "\[rjesolved: That
advertising degrades the quality of life," many affirmatives argued that
the portrayal of women as beautiful objects for men's consumption is a
manifestation of patriarchy that results in tangible harms to women such
as rising rates of eating disorders. The fall 1992 topic, "(rjesolved:
That the welfare system exacerbates the problems of the urban poor in
the United States," also had its share of patri- archy cases.
Affirmatives typically argued that women's dependence upon a patriarchal
welfare system results in increasing rates of women's poverty. [In
addition to]{.underline} these [concrete harms to individual women, most
affirmatives]{.underline} on both topics, [desiring "big impacts,"
argued that the effects of patriarchy include nightmarish
totalitarianism and/or nuclear annihilation]{.underline}. On the
negative, [many debaters countered with arguments that the some aspect
of the resolution in some way sustains or energizes the feminist
movement in resistance to patriarchal harms.]{.underline} For example,
some negatives argued that sexist advertising provides an impetus for
the reinvigoration of the feminist movement and/or feminist
consciousness, ultimately solving the threat of patriarchal nuclear
annihilation. likewise, debaters negating the welfare topic argued that
the state of the welfare system is the key issue around which the
feminist movement is mobilizing or that the consequence of the welfare
system -- breakup of the patriarchal nuclear family -undermines
patriarchy as a whole. Such [arguments seem to have two assumptions in
common]{.underline}. [First, there is a single feminism.]{.underline} As
a result, [feminists are transformed into feminism]{.underline}.
[Debaters speak of feminism as a single, monolithic, theoretical and
pragmatic entity and feminists as women with identical motivations,
methods, and goals]{.underline}. Second, [these **[arguments]{.mark}
assume [that patriarchy is the]{.mark} single or [root cause]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} all forms of [oppression]{.mark}. Patriarchy not only is
responsible for sexism and the consequent oppression of women, it also
is the cause of totalitarianism, environmental degradation, nuclear war,
racism, and capitalist exploitation. These reductionist arguments
[reflect an **unwillingness to debate**]{.mark} about [the complexities
of]{.mark} human [motivation]{.mark} and explanation. [**They
betray**]{.mark} a reliance upon a framework of [**proof** that can
explain only material]{.mark} conditions and physical [realities through
empirical quantification]{.mark}]{.underline}. The transformation of
feminists 'Mo feminism and the identification of patriarchy as the sole
cause of all oppression is related in part to the current form of
intercollegiate debate practice. By "form," I refer to Kenneth Burke's
notion of form, defined as the "creation of appetite in the mind of the
auditor, and the adequate satisfying of that appetite"
(Counter-Statement 31). Though the framework for this understanding of
form is found in literary and artistic criticism, it is appropriate in
this context; as Burke notes, literature can be "equipment for living"
(Biilosophy 293). He also suggests that [form "is an arousing and
fulfillment of desires]{.underline}. A work has form in so far as one
part of it leads a reader to anticipate another part, to be gratified by
the sequence" (Counter-Statement 124). Burke observes that there are
several aspects to the concept of form. One of these aspects,
conventional form, involves to some degree the appeal of form as form.
Progressive, repetitive, and minor forms, may be effective even though
the reader has no awareness of their formality. But [when a form appeals
as form, we designate it as conventional form. Any form can become
conventional, and be sought for itself]{.underline} -- whether it be as
complex as the Greek tragedy or as compact as the sonnet
(Counter-Statement 126). These concepts help to explain debaters'
continuing reluctance to employ rhetorical proof in arguments about
causality. Debaters practice the convention of poor causal reasoning as
a result of judges' unexamined reliance upon conventional form.
Convention is the practice of arguing single-cause links to monolithic
impacts that arises out of custom or usage. Conventional form is the
expectation of judges that an argument will take this form. [Common
practice or convention dictates that a case or disadvantage with
nefarious impacts causally related to a single link will "outweigh"
opposing claims in the mind of the judge]{.underline}. In this sense,
[debate arguments themselves are conventional. Debaters practice the
convention of establishing single-cause relationships to large
monolithic impacts in order to conform to audience expectation. Debaters
practice poor causal reasoning because they are rewarded for it by
judges.]{.underline} The convention of arguing single-cause links leads
the judge to anticipate the certainty of the impact and to be gratified
by the sequence. I suspect that [the sequence is gratifying for judges
because it relieves us from the responsibility and difficulties of
evaluating rhetorical proofs.]{.underline} We are caught between our
responsibility to evaluate rhetorical proofs and our reluctance to
succumb to complete relativism and subjectivity. To take responsibility
for evaluating rhetorical proof is to admit that not every question has
an empirical answer. However, [when we abandon our responsibility to
rhetorical proofs, we sacrifice our students' understanding of causal
reasoning]{.underline}. The sacrifice has consequences for our students'
knowledge of the subject matter they are debating. For example, [when
feminism is defined as a single entity, not as a pluralized movement or
theory, that single entity results in the identification of patriarchy
as the sole cause of oppression.]{.underline} [The result is ignorance
of the subject position of the particular feminist author, for
highlighting his or her subject position might draw attention to the
incompleteness of the causal relationship between link and
impact]{.underline} Consequently, [debaters do not challenge the basic
assumptions of such argumentation and ignorance of feminists is
perpetuated.]{.underline} Feminists are not feminism[. The topics of
feminist inquiry are many and varied, as are the philosophical
approaches to the study of these topics]{.underline}. Different authors
have attempted categorization of various feminists in distinctive ways.
For example, Alison Jaggar argues that feminists can be divided into
four categories: liberal feminism, marxist feminism, radical feminism,
and socialist feminism. [While]{.underline} each of these [feminists may
share a common commitment to the improvement of women's situations, they
differ from each other in very important ways and reflect divergent
philosophical assumptions that make them each unique]{.underline}. Linda
Alcoff presents an entirely different categorization of feminist theory
based upon distinct understandings of the concept "woman," including
cultural feminism and post-structural feminism. Karen Offen utilizes a
comparative historical approach to examine two distinct modes of
historical argumentation or discourse that have been used by women and
their male allies on behalf of women's emancipation from male control in
Western societies. These include relational feminism and individualist
feminism. Elaine Marks and Isabelle de Courtivron describe a whole
category of French feminists that contain many distinct versions of the
feminist project by French authors. Women of color and third-world
feminists have argued that [even these broad categorizations of the
various feminism have neglected the contributions of non-white,
non-Western feminists]{.underline} (see, for example, hooks; Hull;
Joseph and Lewis; Lorde; Moraga; Omolade; and Smith). In this
literature, the very definition of feminism is contested. Some feminists
argue that "all feminists are united by a commitment to improving the
situation of women" (Jaggar and Rothenberg xii), while others have
resisted the notion of a single definition of feminism, bell hooks
observes, "a central problem within feminist discourse has been our
inability to either arrive at a consensus of opinion about what feminism
is (or accept definitions) that could serve as points of unification"
(Feminist Theory 17). The [controversy over the very definition of
feminism has political implications. The power to define is the power
both to include and exclude people and ideas in and from that
feminism.]{.underline} As a result, [\[bjourgeois white women interested
in women's rights issues have been satisfied with simple definitions for
obvious reasons.]{.underline} Rhetorically placing themselves in the
same social category as oppressed women, they were not anxious to call
attention to race and class privilege (hooks. Feminist Wieory 18).
Debate arguments that assume a singular conception of feminism include
and empower the voices of race- and class-privileged women while
excluding and silencing the voices of feminists marginalized by race and
class status. [This position becomes clearer when we examine the second
assumption of arguments about feminism in intercollegiate debate --
patriarchy is the sole cause of oppression. Important feminist thought
has resisted this assumption for good reason. [Designating patriarchy as
the sole cause]{.mark} of oppression [allows]{.mark} the [**subjugation
of resistance** to]{.mark} other forms of oppression like [racism and
classism to the struggle against sexism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such
[subjugation has the effect of denigrating the legitimacy of resistance
to racism and classism as struggles of equal importance.]{.underline}
"Within feminist movement in the West, this led to the assumption that
resisting patriarchal domination is a more legitimate feminist action
than resisting racism and other forms of domination" (hooks. Talking
Back 19). The [relegation of struggles against racism and class
exploitation to offspring status is not the only implication of the
"sole cause" argument In addition, [identifying patriarchy as the single
source of oppression **obscures women's perpetration** of other]{.mark}
forms of [subjugation]{.mark} and domination]{.underline}, bell hooks
argues that [we should not obscure the reality that women can and do
partici- pate in politics of domination, as perpetrators as well as
victims -- that we dominate, that we are dominated]{.underline}. [If
[focus on]{.mark} patriarchal domination masks this reality or becomes
the means by which women deflect attention from the real conditions and
circumstances of our lives, then women cooperate in suppressing and
promoting false consciousness, inhibiting our capacity to assume
responsibility for transforming ourselves and society]{.underline}
(hooks. Talking Back 20). [Characterizing [patriarchy]{.mark} as the
sole cause of oppression [allows]{.mark} mainstream [feminists to
**abdicate responsibility** for]{.mark} the exercise of [class and race
privilege. It casts]{.mark} the struggle against class
[exploitation]{.mark} and racism [as secondary]{.mark}
concerns.]{.underline} Current [debate practice promotes ignorance of
these issues because debaters appeal to conventional form, the
expectation of judges that they will isolate a single link to a large
impact]{.underline} Feminists become feminism and patriarchy becomes the
sole cause of all evil. Poor causal arguments arouse and fulfill the
expectation of judges by allowing us to surrender our responsibility to
evaluate rhetorical proof for complex causal relationships. [[The result
is]{.mark} either [the maginalization]{.mark} or colonization [of
certain feminist voices. **Arguing feminism in debate rounds risks
trivializing feminists.** Privileging the act of speaking]{.mark} about
feminism [over the content of speech "]{.mark}often [turns the
voices]{.mark} and beings [of non-white women into commodity]{.mark},
spectacle]{.underline}" (hooks, Talking Back 14). Teaching sophisticated
causal reasoning enables our students to learn more concerning the
subject matter about which they argue. In this case, [students would
learn more about the multiplicity of feminists instead of reproducing
the marginalization of many feminist voices in the debate
itself]{.underline}. The content of the speech of feminists must be
investigated to subvert the colonization of exploited women. To do so,
we [must explore alternatives to the formal expectation of [single-cause
links to enormous impacts for appropriation of the marginal voice
threatens the very core of self-determination and free self-expression
for exploited and oppressed peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}. If the
identified audience, those spoken to, is determined solely by ruling
groups who control production and distribution, then it is easy for the
marginal voice striving for a hearing to allow what is said to be
overdetermined by the needs of that majority group who appears to be
listening, to be tuned in (hooks, Talking Back 14). At this point,
[arguments about feminism]{.underline} in intercollegiate [debate seem
to be overdetermined by the expectation of common practice, the "game"
that we play in assuming there is such a thing as a direct and sole
causal link to a monolithic impact]{.underline} To play that game, we
have gone along with the idea that there is a single feminism and the
idea that patriarchal impacts can account for all oppression. In making
this critique, I [am by no means discounting the importance of arguments
about feminism]{.underline} in intercollegiate debate. In fact,
[feminists contain the possibility of a transformational
politic]{.underline} for two reasons. First, feminist concerns affect
each individual intimately. [We are most likely to encounter patriarchal
domination "in an ongoing way in everyday lif]{.underline}e. Unlike
other forms of domination, sexism directly shapes and determines
relations of power in our private lives, in familiar social spaces..."
(hooks. Talking Back 21). Second, the methodology of feminism,
consciousness-raising, contains within it the possibility of real
societal transformation. "lE\]ducation for critical consciousness can be
extended to include politicization of the self that focuses on creating
understanding the ways sex, race, and class together determine our
individual lot and our collective experience" (hooks, Talking Back 24).
[Observing the incongruity between advocacy of single-cause
relationships and feminism does not discount the importance of feminists
to individual or societal consciousness raising]{.underline}.War makes
patriarchy more likely -- proves the impact short-circuits the
alternative

Q

The preceding analysis has attempted to demonstrate how, contrary to the
impression given in the mainstream literature on arms limitation, there
has in fact been a great deal of disarmament -- at least in the terms
understood in the disarmament negotiations of the 1950s and 60s. Yet
these very successes have been coopted by arms controllers in ways that
function to delegitimise disarmament as utopian and appear to confirm
realist representations of a world system with limited potential for
transformation. [This article has also demonstrated the way in which
global civil society has been able to set an apparently more radical,
new arms limitation agenda for the new wars -- one in particular which
has emphasised human and economic security rather than state and
military security. These factors then, represent a basis for optimism
about the future prospects for further disarmament.]{.underline}
However, it is also the case that the contemporary disarmament and
broader arms limitation system is a highly asymmetric one geared to
preserving the military hegemony of the US and its allies. [Moreover,
even [the new arms limitation agenda is characterised by its own
asymmetries]{.mark}. In particular, civil [society has]{.mark}
manifestly [failed to gain the same level of influence over core
military security issues]{.mark} -- for example, NBC or the trade in
major conventional weapons that keeps Western defence industries
viable.]{.underline} In some respects then, this analysis shares certain
commonalities with offensive realist critiques that emphasise the
problematic nature of arms control theory (albeit from a different
standpoint) and the supremacy of politics and power in determining the
possibilities for the control of arms.86 One response, therefore, might
be to adopt a similar attitude of resigned cynicism in the face of the
overwhelming influence of power and interest in shaping discourse and
practice -- and to conclude that a truly emancipatory, as opposed to
asymmetric, disarmament agenda is unrealisable. **[However, there are
both material and ideational factors immanent in the contemporary
international system that suggest a politics of radical emancipatory
disarmament can be constituted. First, the success of existing
disarmament initiatives -- albeit under asymmetry -- highlights the
real-world relevance of disarmament proposals still dismissed as failed
and utopian. This illustrates the potential for a more radical
disarmament agenda to be realised by simultaneously [deconstructing
hegemonic framings of the arms limitation problem and developing
alternative narratives that contain inherently transformatory
meanings]{.mark} -- a powerful political act in itself.]{.underline}**
Second, the influential role of global civil society in new arms
limitation suggests the possibility of a truly progressive practice of
arms limitation -- a kind of disarmament from below.87 **[In particular,
campaigns such as those on landmines or conflict diamonds demonstrate
the (as yet unfulfilled) potential for networked and adaptive rhizomatic
movements to envision and realise radical alternative security futures.
This is not to deny the significant power differentials that exist
between states and civil society movements that may themselves have
different goals. However, the flexibility of such movements contrasts
sharply with the rigid and sclerotic statist institutions most
immediately geared to dealing with the diplomacy of arms limitation.
Moreover, at their optimal, such [swarming resistances to hegemony have
the potential to exploit the uncontrollable spaces and flows of a
networked information]{.mark} age88 to generate focused policy goals and
shared understandings; to generate political and cultural power by
exploiting global media tropes (Princess Diana as beatified saint
opposed to landmines) or creating their own (diamonds as blood
diamonds);89 to challenge both the threat discourses that underpin the
arms dynamic and the counsels of despair in the face of anarchy and a
supposed military technological imperative that lie at the heart of arms
control theory; and to thus effect change by eroding the legitimacy of
institutions and actors upholding militarism.90]{.underline}** Moreover,
such movements have the potential to resolve the perennial debate over
what has to come first before disarmament is realised -- radical
reduction of armaments or radical political change. The inevitable
corollary of the emergence of such rhizomatic social movements is that
the very act of campaigning for a radical disarmament agenda presages
radical change in the nature of local-global politics -- the one brings
the other into being, and vice versa. [Third, it might also be argued
that this is precisely the wrong time to articulate a new disarmament
agenda, particularly given the imperatives of the 'war on terror'.
However, to the extent that the threat of 'WMD' terrorism is rooted in
material conditions, the safest response is to eliminate the very
weaponry that might be utilised -- to move, if you like, from a policy
that aims to prevent loose nukes to a policy that aims simply to lose
nukes.]{.underline} Furthermore, rather than being an inopportune moment
to pursue a radical disarmament agenda, it is clear that we are now
facing a range of new and old arms limitation challenges that will
require a radically different kind of arms regulation. These include
challenges such as the growing pressure to weaponise space, the military
potential of the new biology, the weaponisation of nanotechnology and
the challenge of controlling the military uses of cyberspace[. A further
challenge is that presented by the growing importance of dual-use
technology for the military. This has been compounded by the
simultaneous concentration and globalised integration of the defence
industry in a largely Western-dominated hub and spoke model
characterised by the erosion of defence industrial national identities
and increased intra-firm movement of technology and
knowledge.91]{.underline} [Finally, there is the problem presented by
the extension and intensification of illicit global arms networks that
exploit porous borders, corrupt officials, lax regulation and the
mechanisms of globalisation to move arms to conflict
zones.]{.underline}92 The corollary of all this is that traditional,
supply-side non-proliferation initiatives based around the ability of
hermetic nation-states to supervise the physical movement of military
technology will inevitably be subject to declining utility. Such
developments then, are likely to require a qualitative step-shift in the
application of end-use monitoring and the kind of intrusive verification
of civil industries dealing with dual-use technologies presaged in the
CWC; the innovative adaptation of existing arms limitation methodologies
adopted by recipients and the peripheries -- such as the extension of
nuclear weapons-free zones to incorporate bans on other military
technologies, or the greater use of moratoria/bans on arms imports; and
an enhanced role for local-global civil society as presaged by the role
of NGOs in monitoring implementation of the landmines treaty. [In sum,
if the challenge of controlling contemporary military technology is to
be addressed effectively (and it may not be, of course), then the new
arms limitation agenda of the current era is likely to represent merely
a half-way house towards a radically novel practice of arms limitation.
This will entail a move away from control primarily based on physical
management of objects (finished weapons, national militaries) and their
accumulation and movement within or across borders.]{.underline}
Instead, current trends will require a shift to a form of oversight and
limitation characterised by swarming.[93 Such an approach will focus far
more on dual-use technologies and thus intrude into the very warp and
weft of socioeconomic life. It will be marked by a move from the
asymmetry of hegemon/supplier-dominated control and nonproliferation
instruments and imply a far greater role for recipients and the
peripheries. It will require such a qualitative intensification and
expansion of the network of arms limitation practices that this in
itself will constitute a radically novel approach to arms
limitation.]{.underline} And it will require the interactive,
interpenetrated agency of multiple institutions and actors from states,
multilateral institutions, NGOs, industry, media, epistemic communities
and society generally.

#### Alt [causes]{.underline} war --the [alternative]{.underline} to arms control is [disarm]{.underline} which incentivizes [challengers]{.underline} in other theaters 

**[Quester 89]{.underline}**(George H., phD & Chair of Gov & Politics
\@Maryland, International-Security Criticisms of Peace Research The
Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol.
504,Peace Studies: Past and Future (Jul., 1989), pp. 98-105)

The first very basic complaint to be made about peace research is that
it accepts the same overarching premise about international relations,
and about life, that most traditional American liberals-this is a
category that includes Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater and Woodrow
Wilson and William Jennings Bryan and it is not what George Bush was
trying to impute to Michael Dukakis-have accepted and that most Marxists
also accept, namely, that good things go together. Most Americans have,
ever since 1776, assumed intuitively that good and proper domestic
institutions will lead to international peace. As Louis Hartz noted
several decades ago, this has not been the normal assumption in the
continental European tradition, but Americans were able to escape that
tradition almost from the Mayflower Compact.\' Hartz noted that such
assumptions go unquestioned for the great majority of people in the
United States, because alternative world outlooks have always had very
little following inside our borders. If there is an orthodox approach to
issues of war and peace in America, this assumption is it, and **[peace
research could]{.underline}** thus **[be accused of reflecting
a]{.underline}** very **[deep]{.underline}** **[and pernicious
orthodoxy]{.underline}** here. The assumption **[that domestic reform
will lead to international peace]{.underline}** or that one kind of
international improvement will always support another kind of
international improvement **[has emphatically not been endorsed by
traditional European analysts of power politics.]{.underline}** It has
been endorsed, however, as part of another intellectual tradition, by
Marxists in their own approach to the analysis of the causes of war. To
cure a domestic evil, by such a set of assumptions, is to eliminate an
international evil as well. Liberals and Marxists indeed very much agree
that wars and arms races are international evils, while dramatically
disagreeing about what is better or more evil at home.2 By contrast, a
third perspective, that of the realist, or power-politics, school of
international relations analysis, most persuasively put forward after
World War II in the writings of Hans Morgenthau,3 argued that there is
no such benign pattern to the universe, no pattern by which one would
not have to choose between goals. **[While there is much of the
power-politics perspective]{.underline}** that today\'s researchers on
**[arms control]{.underline}** and international security **[would have
rejected]{.underline}** or dropped, **[they would]{.underline}**
nonetheless **[retain a]{.underline}**t least some of the
**[pessimism]{.underline}** or realism of acknowledging that **[there is
often some need to choose,]{.underline}** and **[this is lacking in the
peace-studies]{.underline}** peace. **[When asked how they would choose
between preventing nuclear war and]{.underline}** preventing
**[conventional war]{.underline}**, many people who style themselves
**[peace researchers]{.underline}** **[will]{.underline}** thus simply
**[refuse to comment]{.underline}**, **[regarding it]{.underline}** as
**[a moral betrayal]{.underline}** even **[to acknowledge]{.underline}**
that **[such a choice might]{.underline}** ever **[have to be
made]{.underline}**, arguing that there must somehow be a solution that
never would require giving up on either gain. Similarly, if asked to
choose between eliminating poverty and eliminating war, the same
researchers will again run away from the question, as if it were some
kind of trap. **[Yet [there are tough choices to be made]{.mark} in this
world]{.underline}**. The same nuclear weapons that, by being deployed
in Western Europe, might produce an escalation to an all-out
thermonuclear World War III may also have contributed to keeping Europe
from engaging in another conventional war for more than four decades, an
unusually long time for that continent. **[The [arms-control]{.mark}
perspective [recognizes]{.mark}]{.underline}** such **[tough
choices]{.underline}**, in effect, **[by stressing a
yardstick]{.underline}** of at least [**[three
outputs]{.underline}**,]{.mark} phrased most aptly by Thomas Schelling
and Morton Halperin some three decades ago:**[4 [reducing the likelihood
of war, reducing]{.mark} the [destruction]{.mark} in war [if
it]{.mark}]{.underline}** actually **[[occurs]{.mark}, [and
reducing]{.mark} the economic and other [burdens of]{.mark} peacetime
[readiness]{.mark} for the possibility of war]{.underline}**.
**[These]{.underline}** outputs **[are each important,
but]{.underline}** in case after case, they get in each other\'s way,
**[may conflict]{.underline}** with each other, **[and]{.underline}**
may **[force us to make difficult and unpleasant choices.]{.underline}**
Compared to these outputs, the variable of disarmament is only an input,
something that is valuable if, and only if, it conduces to these
desirable end outputs. **[[Peace researchers]{.underline}]{.mark}**
would, of course, hardly question that the three categories of output
listed by Schelling and Halperinwhich can again be broken into many,
possibly conflicting, subcategories-are a good thing. Yet they
**[tend]{.underline}**, nonetheless**[, to [focus on disarmament]{.mark}
very directly, often advocating total disarmament, as if this were a
good thing in and of itself,]{.underline}** or **[as if something as
good as disarmament could not possibly conflict with anything else in
life that was morally desirable.]{.underline}** The **[peace researchers
are]{.underline}** thus somehow **[[convinced]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that **[[there are no good weapons]{.mark},]{.underline}** and **[[they
regard]{.underline}]{.mark}** any talk of **[[arms control as]{.mark}
merely [a trick]{.mark}]{.underline}**, intended **[to persuade them [to
relax their opposition to]{.mark} every form of [preparation for
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When the case is made that submarine-based
nuclear missiles have actually been desirable for the world, since 1960
markedly reducing the tensions of each side\'s fearing an attack by the
other, perhaps even thereby reducing the total of resources that would
otherwise have been wasted on military programs, the peace researcher
makes himself or herself intellectually blind to such arguments. If
someone from the international- security research community were to
suggest, perhaps facetiously, perhaps more seriously, that the Nobel
Peace Prize is overdue for the developers of the Polaris missile
program, the peace researcher would react with anger and dismay, rather
than having his or her curiosity aroused by the suggestion.\' **[There
are indeed many bad weapons,]{.underline}** weapons that make war more
likely and more destructive, and weapons that waste a great deal of
money. **[But not every choice]{.underline}** in this field of life
**[is]{.underline}** thus what the economists would call **[Pareto
optimal]{.underline}**, whereby an improvement can be made by all
measures and no difficult choices have to be made. Rather, **[we
quickly]{.underline}** enough **[run out of the simpler choices
and]{.underline}** then **[reach the hard]{.underline}** decisions,
**[where [disarmament might make wars more
likely]{.mark},]{.underline}** or **[where [making war less likely in
one theater would make it more likely in another]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
and so forth. More broadly, **[the peace researcher is
convinced]{.underline}** that the **[elimination of social ills
will]{.underline}** almost always tend to **[reduce the risks of war as
well]{.underline}**. No one in the more realistic
international-securities community is opposed to the spread of literacy
or to the eradication of disease and starvation and poverty. Yet what
are we to make of the fact that the Mediterranean country with the
highest per capita income has been Cy- prus? **[There is, unhappily, no
real evidence that the conflicts that cause a nation to be ready to go
to violent warfare disappear when other problems
disappear]{.underline}**; **[the linkage often seems to be the reverse.
Peace researchers]{.underline}** often **[style
themselves]{.underline}** **[as protesting heretics]{.underline}**, at
odds with the orthodox establishment. **[Yet, on this]{.underline}**
first basic point, **[they are,]{.underline}** as noted, **[much less
rebellious than they realize]{.underline}** and much more **[ready to
accept]{.underline}** **[what most Americans accept as an orthodox
intuition]{.underline}**, namely, the premise that God did not play dice
with the universe on moral entities, that good things go together, that
eliminating one evil will eliminate others as well. Morgenthau and his
colleagues, when they began offering alternative-more traditionally
Europeantheories of realpolitik to Americans, indeed also felt like
heretics, protesting against an orthodoxy of ideas, and probably had
more justification for this feeling. Most American students, and most
Americans in general, approach the study of war and peace with this most
orthodox of assumptions, an assumption that the peace-research community
panders to, that war would become unlikely if economic injustices and
human rights violations were eliminated, and that war would become
unlikely if arms were reduced.6 **[It may simply be factually wrong to
accept this kind of assumption uncritically, or to refuse to consider
the possibility that an improvement on one front might come only at the
price of a setback on another. Given that our subject is the avoidance
of some very disastrous possibilities of war, it might indeed be
dangerous to stick to these underlying premises of peace
research.]{.underline}** (99-101)

There is, wrote H. L. Mencken, "always a well-known solution to every
human problem---neat, plausible, and wrong."1 Mencken's aphorism applies
in spades to the subject of this account. **[[To
imagine]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [**[there exists a simple antidote
to the "military metaphysic"]{.underline}** to]{.mark} which the people
and government of the United States have fallen prey **[[is to
misconstrue]{.mark} the problem]{.underline}**. As the foregoing
chapters make plain, the origins of America's present-day infatuation
with military power are anything but simple. American **[[militarism is
not the invention of a cabal nursing fantasies of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
global **[[empire]{.underline}]{.mark}** and manipulating an
unsuspecting people frightened by the events of 9/11. Further, it is
counterproductive to think in these terms--- to assign culpability to a
particular president or administration and to imagine that throwing the
bums out will put things right. Yet neither does the present-day status
of the United States as sole superpower reveal an essential truth,
whether positive or negative, about the American project. Enthusiasts
(mostly on the right) who interpret America's possession of unrivaled
and unprecedented armed might as proof that the United States enjoys the
mandate of heaven are deluded. But so too are those (mostly on the left)
who see in the far-flung doings of today's U.S. military establishment
substantiation of Major General Smedley Butler's old chestnut that "war
is just a racket" and the American soldier "a gangster for capitalism"
sent abroad to do the bidding of Big Business or Big Oil.2
**[Neither]{.underline}** the will of **[God nor]{.underline}** the
venality of **[Wall Street]{.underline}** suffices to
**[explain]{.underline}** how the United States managed to become stuck
in World **[War]{.underline}** IV. Rather, the new American
**[[militarism is a]{.underline}]{.mark}** little like pollution---the
perhaps unintended, but **[[foreseeable by-product
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** prior choices and **[[decisions made without
taking fully into account the full range of costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**
likely to be incurred. In making the industrial revolution, the captains
of American enterprise did not consciously set out to foul the
environment, but as they harnessed the waters, crisscrossed the nation
with rails, and built their mills and refineries, negative consequences
ensued. Lakes and rivers became choked with refuse, the soil
contaminated, and the air in American cities filthy. By the time that
the industrial age approached its zenith in the middle of the twentieth
century, most Americans had come to take this for granted; a degraded
environment seemed the price you had to pay in exchange for material
abundance and by extension for freedom and opportunity. Americans might
not like pollution, but there seemed to be no choice except to put up
with it. To appreciate that this was, in fact, not the case, Americans
needed a different consciousness. This is where the environmental
movement, beginning more or less in the 1960s, made its essential
contribution. Environmentalists enabled Americans to see the natural
world and their relationship to that world in a different light. They
argued that the obvious deterioration in the environment was
unacceptable and not at all inevitable. Alternatives did exist.
**[Different [policies]{.mark}]{.underline}** and practices
**[[could]{.underline}]{.mark}** stanch and even
**[[reverse]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Purist]{.mark}s]{.underline}** in
that movement insisted upon the primacy of environmental needs,
everywhere and in all cases. Theirs was (and is) a principled position
deserving to be heard. To act on their
**[[recommendations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however,
**[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely **[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark}**
shutting down the economy, **[an [impractical]{.mark} and politically
infeasible course of [action]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Pragmatists]{.underline}]{.mark}** advanced a different argument.
They **[[suggested]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[it was possible to
negotiate [a compromise]{.mark} [between]{.mark}]{.underline}** economic
needs and environmental **[[imperatives]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This
compromise might oblige Americans to curtail certain bad habits, but it
did not require changing the fundamentals of how they lived their lives.
Americans could keep their cars and continue their love affair with
consumption; but at the same time they could also have cleaner air and
cleaner water. Implementing this compromise has produced an outcome that
environmental radicals (and on the other side, believers in
laissez-faire capitalism) today find unsatisfactory. In practice, it
turns out, once begun negotiations never end. Bargaining is continuous,
contentious, and deeply politicized. Participants in the process seldom
come away with everything they want. Settling for half a loaf when you
covet the whole is inevitably frustrating. But the results are
self-evident. Environmental conditions in the United States today are
palpably better than they were a half century ago. Pollution has not
been vanquished, but it has become more manageable. Furthermore, the
nation has achieved those improvements without imposing on citizens
undue burdens and without preventing its entrepreneurs from innovating,
creating, and turning a profit. **[Restoring]{.underline}** a semblance
of **[balance]{.underline}** and good sense **[to]{.underline}** the way
that Americans think about **[military power will require
a]{.underline}** similarly **[pragmatic approach]{.underline}**. Undoing
all of the negative effects that result from having been seduced by war
may lie beyond reach, but Americans can at least make them more
manageable and thereby salvage their democracy. In explaining the
origins of the new American militarism, this account has not sought to
assign or to impute blame. None of the protagonists in this story sat
down after Vietnam and consciously plotted to propagate perverse
attitudes toward military power any more than Andrew Carnegie or John D.
Rockefeller plotted to despoil the nineteenth-century American
landscape. The clamor after Vietnam to rebuild the American arsenal and
to restore American self-confidence, the celebration of soldierly
values, the search for ways to make force more usable: all of these came
about because groups of Americans thought that they glimpsed in the
realm of military affairs the solution to vexing problems. The soldiers
who sought to rehabilitate their profession, the intellectuals who
feared that America might share the fate of Weimar, the strategists
wrestling with the implications of nuclear weapons, the conservative
Christians appalled by the apparent collapse of traditional morality:
none of these acted out of motives that were inherently dishonorable. To
the extent that we may find fault with the results of their efforts,
that fault is more appropriately attributable to human fallibility than
to malicious intent. And yet in the end it is not motive that matters
but outcome. Several decades after Vietnam, in the aftermath of a
century filled to overflowing with evidence pointing to the limited
utility of armed force and the dangers inherent in relying excessively
on military power, the American people have persuaded themselves that
their best prospect for safety and salvation lies with the sword. Told
that despite all of their past martial exertions, treasure expended, and
lives sacrificed, the world they inhabit is today more dangerous than
ever and that they must redouble those exertions, they dutifully assent.
Much as dumping raw sewage into American lakes and streams was once
deemed unremarkable, so today "global power projection"---a phrase whose
sharp edges we have worn down through casual use, but which implies
military activism without apparent limit---has become standard practice,
a normal condition, one to which no plausible alternatives seem to
exist. All of this Americans have come to take for granted: it's who we
are and what we do. Such a definition of normalcy cries out for a close
and critical reexamination. Surely, the surprises, disappointments,
painful losses, and woeful, even shameful failures of the Iraq War make
clear the need to rethink the fundamentals of U.S. military policy. Yet
a meaningful reexamination will require first a change of consciousness,
seeing war and America's relationship to war in a fundamentally
different way. Of course, dissenting views already exist. A rich
tradition of American pacifism abhors the resort to violence as always
and in every case wrong. Advocates of disarmament argue that by their
very existence weapons are an incitement to violence. In the former
camp, there can never be a justification for war. In the latter camp,
the shortest road to peace begins with the beating of swords into
ploughshares. These are principled views that deserve a hearing, more so
today than ever. By discomfiting the majority, advocates of such views
serve the common good. But to make full-fledged pacifism or
comprehensive disarmament the basis for policy in an intrinsically
disordered world would be to open the United States to grave danger.

#### International legal norms are [inevitable]{.underline}

**[from the present course]{.underline}**. **[To deny]{.underline}** the

**[[neo-liberal powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** that be **[[to
exploit]{.mark} the downfall of [the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
international **[[system]{.mark} for their own advantage]{.underline}**.
n94 **[[Under no circumstance should we succumb to
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** ultraliberal **[[refusal to tackle mutual
problems in the way]{.underline}]{.mark}** welfare-inducing **[[law
does]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as the latter would thus become a
regrettable avatar of classical liberal law. It is not, however,
surprising that there is currently a resurgence, in \[\*850\]
international law, of the old debate between ultraliberals, who express
discontentment with too much law and bureaucracy, and moderate liberals,
whose sole intent is to reform the system. Yet restoring the image of a
classical but incentive-creating system would be inconsistent with the
profound socio-cultural changes the contemporary international system
has undergone, and with the legitimate aspirations held by millions of
individuals, is therefore not an option either. The shift toward ethical
and functionalist welfare-inducing law is the product of a redefinition
of politics and of the fabric of international society itself, and is
accompanying the evolution of this society and structuring it
accordingly. Classical society and liberal international law were based
on international politics as defined solely by States. Contemporary
welfare-inducing society presupposes that political power must aim at
fostering communal wellbeing around the planet. But the 1945 consensus
deteriorated long ago, as it was borne out of exceptional circumstances.
It now needs to be reconstituted in the context of the new society. The
legal values and objectives contemporary international law aspires to
correspond to political priorities and certainly do not flow from a
universal consciousness. They are the result of choices that were quite
understandable in 1945, but that now need to be reformulated or revoked
outright, as even if the same objectives undoubtedly still remain, the
modalities have changed and the circle of addressees has become
considerably larger. n95 Some have represented current phenomena in the
international system as the result of a \"crisis of authority\" related
to a double crisis of State sovereignty and of territoriality. n96 This
is deemed to explain the inability of international law to regulate the
current disorder and to create a stable order. However, just as one
refers to a \"global inversion\" to describe the diminishing of
sovereignties faced with emancipated groups and individuals, one could
equally refer to an \"inversion of international law\" since this **[law
is increasingly restraining States and empowering
individuals]{.underline}**, minorities, and peoples
**[through]{.underline}** the recognition of **[rights]{.underline}**.
This approach is said to be based on \"the actor getting his own back on
the system.\" n97 States are no longer the sole members, actors, and
subjects of international society, and individuals and NGOs are now
seeking recognition under international law. **[Today, [there are
hundreds of international organizations]{.mark}, thousands of
NGOs]{.underline}** - including 2,719 with ECOSOC status - **[and
hundreds of multinationals]{.underline}** \[\*851\] thriving in the 208
States and territories. These are the entities with which States,
international organizations, and international politicians interact, n98
**[[which is why]{.underline}]{.mark}** political **[cohesion and [the
legitimacy of the existing system require that]{.mark}]{.underline}**
all **[[actors adhere to shared values]{.underline}]{.mark}**. n99 All
could be different if there were greater consciousness of the fact that
a legal system can be used beneficially and not simply endured
passively. That being said, one should not minimize the role played by
States, and should acknowledge the amicable concurrence of interstatists
and cosmopolitans, voluntarists, and communitarians. This is not to put
in question the principle of interventionist welfare-inducing law, but
rather to question its functioning and the limits to which it should be
subject. This may appear surprising and perhaps even shocking
considering the sociological state of the planet with all its
inequalities and injustices, where collective and individual suffering
has never been as dramatic and devastating. The neo-Marxist economists
Etienne Balibar and Immanuel Wallerstein have illustrated how major
conflicts of interest, monopolist and exclusionary phenomena, and the
unequal development of powers have persisted due to an excess of unequal
resistance from the periphery. n100 But this is precisely what has
prompted the present essay, since **[the solution might]{.underline}**
actually **[lie in subjecting law to]{.underline}** certain **[limits.
[I]{.mark}nternational [law may be \"]{.mark}part of [the
problem]{.mark},\" [but it is]{.mark} also]{.underline}**, as has been
emphasised by Philippe Sands, n101 \"**[part of [the
solution]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" so long as possible options do not go
to the detriment of social or political processes or the will of the
State. Without returning to classical minimalist law, we need to fight
the preconception that reducing law is equivalent to regression, and
that any limitation on sovereignty is a victory. How far should
international law go in accomplishing its aims? **[Is it the miracle
solution to all]{.underline}** of the world\'s
**[problems?]{.underline}** The answer is obviously
**[no]{.underline}**. **[Law is not a universal panacea]{.underline}**.
Politics determine international law, even if sometimes they appear to
ignore it. Any discourse that glorifies international law and its
virtues is usually \[\*852\] accompanied by criticism of its weaknesses
and perverse effects. This anthropomorphic vision of international law
has the aim of turning it into a being in its own right that can be
conveniently accused of defaults that are in fact those of the entities
that created it, i.e. principally States, politicians, international
experts such as us international jurists, but also those who would like
to appropriate international law, such as NGOs, lobbies,
individuals/associations, think tanks, and multinational corporations,
which undoubtedly exercise political power despite hesitating to
acknowledge it openly. This anthropomorphic vision needs to be rejected
so that everyone can be allocated their proper role and usefulness. In
fact, the present situation is interesting in that it reveals the
functioning of western political modernity and its tendency to isolate
the legal dimension in order to attribute an exclusive and exorbitant
role to it. Yet the difficulties and tensions that have resulted
illustrate the necessity of re-evaluating the two other dimensions to
which international law is fundamentally connected: the political and
the social. No doubt it is therefore necessary to search for a better
balance, or more precisely, to be more conscious of the political and
social dimensions that are concealed behind the law, and which are
masked by the heightened role of all that is legal. They no longer have
the same mobilizing effect they used to have, at least less than is the
case of, say, legal discourse on human rights. Law does not actually
provide a response to all problems, even if law is now omnipresent. In
fact, the merit of contemporary deconstructivist critique is to have
deconstructed the illusion of complete legal emancipation and to have
attempted to rehabilitate all that is purely political in the
elaboration, interpretation, and application of rules; and it is
undoubtedly this critique that will enable us to accept that
international law can regain strength as a political means of regulating
conduct. n102 What thus takes place behind the smokescreen of
welfare-inducing law is a political game of inclusion and exclusion. Why
has poverty not been eliminated as proclaimed? Is it because law has
remained ineffective and impotent when faced with international reality?
Or is it merely a tree concealing a forest of international
renouncement? Reducing world poverty is a commensurable challenge and
therefore a realizable objective, but it will not be possible as long as
States and other actors have not set themselves truly fundamental and
overriding aims for the benefit of the planet, as well as for their own
domestic systems. \"Poverty is an invention of civilisation,\" n103 and
it is on the latter that its eradication will depend. Studies on the
phenomenon of poverty are very interesting in \[\*853\] this respect,
because they show that at a given moment in the development of a
society, poverty always calls for collective action (and not individual
acts of charity). No sooner are substantial amounts of property
constituted that give rise to inequalities and merciless confrontation
between the rich and the poor, do \"asymmetrical dependencies\" appear
as the most frequent result. n104 The possible defaults and dysfunctions
of welfare-inducing law should not mask political deferral and inaction
at the domestic and international levels, or the fact that international
law has always been used in a profoundly ambiguous way: as a positive
model of inclusion and simultaneously as a negative model of exclusion,
as a positive model of cooperation yet also as a negative model of
domination. The somewhat paradoxical yet inescapable fact is that
welfare-inducing law is, as we have seen, easier to instrumentalize than
strictly liberal law aimed at regulating conduct, and is thus,
ironically, less social and more unjust. It can be used to accelerate
necessary corrections to gaping inequalities between nations or between
individuals, but can also enable superpowers and economic operators to
increase their revenue and importance. Furthermore, it can be
conveniently denounced by the most virulent dictatorships in
underdeveloped countries on the basis that it is inefficient. It can
also be used as a means of obtaining international aid, despite the fact
that the sharp rise in poverty and famine over recent years has actually
been due to negligence, blind collectivism, terror, or civil war. n105
Here, legal interventionist and welfare-orientated discourse can be a
vector of domestic or international domination, much like a powerful
lever of transformation. It should also be noted that strictly legal
discourse will not tell us why things are as they are and which might be
the best way to change them. That is not its role, and it is therefore
not a problem if law does not trump other types of discourse. **[[Law
has]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[become so entrenched in
international society that the latter can no longer be conceptualized
independently]{.underline}]{.mark}** of it. Although it has undoubtedly
always been an instrument of international social and political action,
**[law has never played as important a role as it does
today]{.underline}**. **[International legal problems are no longer
external problems one can]{.underline}** simply **[resolve by
calling]{.underline}** international **[State
conferences]{.underline}**; they have become internalized by all
societies, **[and we are]{.underline}** gradually **[losing our ability
to distance ourselves]{.underline}** from them, and indeed from law
itself. Yet distinguishing roles and finalities is all the more
difficult when law is not in \[\*854\] itself capable of effectuating
change and remains dependent on politics and adaptation. The debate on
the ability of politics to bring about change on an international level
is as old as international society itself, and its current prevalence
indicates its re-emergence. Although many analysts have taken
neo-realist, neo-institutionalist, neo-functionalist, globalizationist,
or transnationalist positions on this issue, n106 the present trend
emphasises that the scope for manoeuvre of \"real international
politics\" is limited due to the rise in bureaucracy, corporate interest
groups, legalism in international relations, transnational networks of
private actors, the incapacities of fragile States, etc., as if there
existed within a decentralized society (which, however, has never been
centralized and thus cannot be decentralized) a sort of political
center-point providing a measure of the effectiveness or legitimacy of
international political action, n107 when in reality the concepts most
often evoked - namely collective State action, \"international
regimes,\" or global governance n108 - actually only recentralize
politics in different manners. n109 Should we perhaps nuance the idea of
an international political \"center\" or \"system,\" either
pessimistically by reference to a new Middle Age, n110 or more
optimistically by emphasizing the importance of the individual\'s new
role as an international actor, n111 the emergence of networks, or of
orderly pluralism, n112 in order to enlarge our perspective on politics
and better understand it? In fact, the increasing relevance of
international law is not putting limitations on power, but bringing
about a reorganization of power. The impression of reduced political
leeway is thus deceptive, since in fact, new political powers are
emerging that involve decisions affecting people and their environment.
The sensation of political powerlessness or of simulacrum derives from
\[\*855\] the fact that politics are reduced to the activities carried
out within the official international political system. n113 However,
whatever is the actual scale of these illusions and developments, they
have instilled a sense of unease in internationalist culture, which is
necessarily political as well as legal given the indissoluble links
between the two. This is the result of the latent but visible state of
disequilibrium between the official appearance of the classical
center-points of political power - States, international organizations,
etc. - where official activities appear efficient and regulatory, but
often fall short of attaining the fixed objectives, and an international
society that is inexorably straying from official political decisions
and introducing new actors with new objectives, decision-making
competencies, and political dimensions. That is not to say that States
and international organizations are not the prime institutional actors
on the international scene, but simply that behind the unchanged facade
of the politics they engage in, new political centre-points are taking
shape. Consequently, the boundary between the political and the
non-political is becoming ever more indeterminate, just as the boundary
between the legal and the non-legal. To paraphrase Prosper Weil, one can
say that politics, much as the law, have become \"diluted.\" The
categories of the political and the non-political, as well as those of
the legal and non-legal, must be re-conceptualized with a view to
redefining political priorities and redefining them collectively, to the
extent that this is possible. How can welfare-inducing law prevail
without a strong and interventionist political center-point to ensure
its application as the European States did in the post-war period from
the fifties to seventies? How can one reconcile the changes in the law
and international politics? Is not what initially seemed paradoxical but
explicable becoming completely contradictory? In any case, there is
little point in pinning all our hopes on politics. Welfare does not seem
to be induced by politics, by the law or by the State, although we have
not altogether reached a dead point. n114 **[[International
politics]{.mark} does not define]{.underline}** man\'s **[happiness,
but]{.underline}** rather **[it]{.underline}** **[[regulates the conduct

RKK)

China and Taiwan marked the Lunar New Year holiday this week with
dueling propaganda videos showcasing their respective military might,
released on social media. It was the latest sign that North Korea may no
longer be the world's most volatile hotspot, the nation most likely to
unleash a major crisis that could spiral out of control. Now that
dubious distinction may be shifting to Taiwan. The root of the problem
is, of course, that China considers Taiwan an inextricable part of its
territory ripped away in 1949 when the government of the Republic of
China, facing military defeat against communist forces on the mainland,
moved to the island. Beijing always saw this as temporary---something to
be rectified when it had the power to do so. Now that time is at hand.
Massive economic growth has given China a degree of influence and
resilience that it never had before. Its military capabilities have
grown extensively. **[And while America has long been committed to
Taiwan's separation from China, the [willingness and ability of the
United States to back Taipei with force seems shakier than
ever]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[For strategists in Beijing, imposing
reunification on Taiwan probably appears more feasible than at any time
since 1949.]{.underline}** What is making the situation particularly
dangerous now is China's mounting internal problems, especially a
slowing economy. Its short-term economic prospects, at least, are
troubling. This matters because the Chinese Communist Party sustains its
rule in part by buying off internal dissatisfaction. The Chinese people
tolerate authoritarianism in exchange for stability and prosperity. But
if economic imbalances and problems mount, the Communist Party may have
a harder time fending off political opposition. As often happens in
authoritarian political systems, economic frustration could turn into
dissent. Undoubtedly, this would lead the regime in Beijing to ramp up
its system of internal security, which is already the most effective on
earth. Authoritarian regimes facing internal opposition have always
tried to ease political pressure through distraction, specifically by
becoming more externally aggressive or exaggerating security threats,
whether foreign or internal. If China experiences a deep and long-term
economic slowdown, it is not hard to imagine the government taking a
more bellicose approach to Taiwan. There are already ominous signs of
that. Last month, an editorial in China's official military newspaper
stated that "war preparations" should be a top priority for the year.
The next day, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's longstanding
position that it reserves the right to use force against Taiwan if it
considers it necessary. This may foreshadow a coming crisis. **[What is
[not clear]{.mark} at this point is [how the United States
would]{.mark}, or should, [respond if China attempts to compel
reunification with Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**. President Donald Trump
seems more committed to the defense of Taiwan than his predecessors,
having approved arms sales to Taipei at a much faster rate. And in
December he signed the pro-Taiwan Asia Reassurance Initiative Act into
law, which aims to counter China's military influence in the region and
boost U.S. support for allies like Taiwan, including arms sales. The key
for the United States is lowering the chances of China believing it can
impose reunification by force. [But would Trump use military force to
defend Taiwan?]{.underline} Even without large-scale U.S. involvement,
China might not be able to conquer Taiwan outright. Conventional
military invasions across bodies of water are extremely difficult. And
time would not be on Beijing's side since any invasion would be
disruptive, even catastrophic, for both the global economy and China,
which depends on exports of manufactured goods and imports of energy and
raw materials to sustain its economy. The United States might respond to
a Chinese invasion of Taiwan with long-range military strikes plus
standoff air defense, anti-ship, space and cyber operations. But
"[[might" is the operative word.]{.mark} U.S. involvement would entail
massive risk. There is the potential that Americans might simply accept
the conquest of Taiwan. Things would be even more difficult for
Washington if China opted for the sort of "gray zone" aggression that
Russia has used to weaken Ukraine---avoiding an outright military
invasion and relying on other destabilizing methods that combine
political, economic, military and technological interference to avoid
provoking a devastating response from the United States.]{.underline}
This would be particularly tricky for Washington if China were able to
replicate what Russia did in Ukraine and find local allies or proxies.
The key for the United States, then, is lowering the chances of China
believing it can impose reunification by force. Since the 1970s, U.S.
policy toward Taiwan has been based on a deliberate strategic ambiguity
as part of the so-called One China policy. Washington opposed
reunification by force but did not treat Taiwan as a sovereign,
independent nation. It indicated that it would oppose a Chinese invasion
of Taiwan but never made clear precisely what it would do in response to
one. The idea was to complicate Beijing's strategic calculation by
making it guess what the United States would do. Ambiguity made sense
when China was economically and militarily weak, but now that is
increasingly dangerous. To minimize the chances of miscalculation,
Beijing must understand the military, economic and political costs of
aggression against Taiwan, including the possibility that the United
States might strike China indirectly or asymmetrically. To make that
happen, the Trump administration should work closely with Congress to
reinforce America's support for Taiwan's continued autonomy. Trump
should specify what Chinese actions against Taiwan the United States
considers unacceptable, and what it would do in response to them. There
is no guarantee this will work. There may be a crisis or conflict over
Taiwan no matter what the United States does. But it is incumbent on
American leaders to diminish the chances of miscalculation. This
requires firming up the U.S. commitment to Taiwan, in order to transform
strategic ambiguity into clarity.

#### US influence and nuclear deterrence checks assurance - 7^th^ fleet deters aggression

**[Ziezulewicz 17]{.underline}** Geoff Ziezulewicz, 10-25-2017, \"Navy
puts three carrier strike groups in 7th Fleet waters,\" Navy Times,

Lowell-SB

[The [Navy]{.mark} now [has three aircraft carriers]{.mark} and their
attendant aircraft and ships in [the waters of 7th Fleet]{.mark}, the
U.S. military's front line in the tensions between the United States and
North Korea. Navy officials said three carriers operating in the
Japan-based command is a [regularly scheduled part of a planned
deployment cycl]{.mark}e.]{.underline} "It is not uncommon for incoming
and outgoing carrier strike group transit timing to overlap as one
begins a deployment and the other concludes," according to a Navy
statement. Still, the carriers Nimitz and Theodore Roosevelt entered 7th
Fleet waters this week. Navy releases for both arrivals state the
carriers and their respective strike groups are scheduled for port
visits and other operations, suggesting that neither is immediately on
its way out of the region. While Navy officials stress that having three
carriers under the same forward command is business as usual, it comes
at a time of heightened tension between President Trump and North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un. Seventh Fleet's lone permanently stationed carrier,
the Ronald Reagan, and its strike group arrived in the South Korean port
city of Busan last week after naval exercises with South Korea aimed at
increasing readiness against North Korea and maintaining stability. The
Nimitz, its strike group, air wing and destroyer squadron entered the
sprawling 7th Fleet area of operations on Wednesday after concluding
operations with the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. Nimitz and its group are
scheduled for a port visit and will be ready to support operations in
the region before heading home, according to a Navy release. Nimitz
deployed in June from its home port of Bremerton, Washington. The
Theodore Roosevelt and its strike group entered 7th Fleet waters Monday
after leaving its San Diego home on Oct. 6. Her deployment is scheduled
to include operations in 5th Fleet waters as well. "USS Theodore
Roosevelt is prepared to carry out the full spectrum of possible
mission, from humanitarian relief to combat operations," the carrier's
CO, Capt. Carlos Sardiello, said in a Navy release. "When a carrier
leaves on deployment, we have to be ready for anything." [Seventh Fleet
is the largest, and arguably busiest, of the Navy's forward-deployed
commands. **In addition to [deterring North Korea and countering the
presence of ascendant Chinese]{.mark} and Russian [navies]{.mark}, [7th
Fleet spans more than seven million square miles]{.mark}, from the
India-Pakistan border east to the international date line, and from the
Antarctic up to the Kuril Islands northeast of Japan.**]{.underline}

The arms sales and vague security pledge have contributed to peace in
the Taiwan Strait, but **[the status quo may not last much
longer]{.underline}**. A recent RAND report concluded that **[China is

Taiwan.]{.underline}** America could absorb the rising cost of defending
Taiwan, but **[the reunification of Taiwan and mainland China is a core
interest of the Chinese government]{.underline}**. Since
**[China]{.underline}** has more at stake, it **[has an incentive to
keep raising the costs of confrontation until the United States is no
longer willing to absorb them.]{.underline}**

**[This argues for dropping Washington's pledge to come to Taiwan's aid.
Supporters]{.underline}** of the pledge **[worry about the message that
a reduced commitment would send to allies]{.underline}** in East Asia.
**[But [there is a]{.mark} significant [difference between a formal

"this tragedy must not be allowed to occur again. We are determined to

that we find the rest of the explanation.

For the past 70 years, since the introduction of nuclear weapons, it is
the policy of the United States to counter proliferation and curb the
expansion of the nuclear club. The United States has been very
successful in providing hefty incentives to states that stop their
exploration or pursuit of nuclear weapons. **[One of these
inducements]{.underline}**, an extended nuclear deterrent, **[obliges
the United States to provide defense and security to allies in the event
of an attack or conflict. Rather than disregarding domestic public
opinion and risking punishment in the international community, Japan can
rely on America's nuclear arsenal.]{.underline}**

**[This is how the United States has been able to use its protection to
constrain risky behavior among its
allies]{.underline}**. [Research](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7615668&fileId=S0043887100006687) in [political
science](http://jcr.sagepub.com/content/58/2/307.abstract) would suggest
that these types of alliances may entrap and force the United States to
get involved when allies take unnecessary risks to get their way. [Neil
Narang](http://www.polsci.ucsb.edu/faculty/narangn/) and I show in a
recent working paper, however, that nuclear umbrellas can positively
shape ally behavior. **[We find that protected allies, like Japan, are
not any more likely to engage in risky business and instead use the
alliance to reap political and economic gains.]{.underline}**

**[This is not to say that Japan has no bargaining power of its
own]{.underline}**. Japan maintains one of the highest latent nuclear
capacities in the
world. [Experts](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/06/26/if-japan-wanted-to-build-a-nuclear-bomb-itd-be-awesome-at-it/) argue
that if Japan were to desire nuclear weapons its "break out" time would
be short**[.]{.underline}** But it's this capability that provides Japan
with leverage. In a new working paper, [Gene
Gerzhoy](http://www.gene-gerzhoy.com/), [Rachel
Whitlark](http://rachel-whitlark.squarespace.com/), and I find that this
capability doesn't necessarily embolden countries. Instead, they use it,
short of opting to get nuclear weapons, to settle disputes, gain
concessions, and side-step external aggression.

**[These factors, coupled with Japan's own distaste for nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, suggest that despite Donald Trump's perspective
and potential policy, if elected to the presidency, **[a nuclear-armed
Japan is virtually unthinkable and highly undesirable.]{.underline}**

REASSURING U.S. ALLIES

Possibly **[the most frequently raised objection to the United States
ending its commitment to Taiwan is that it would undermine the
credibility of U.S. defense commitments]{.underline}** to its East Asia
allies. **[This [concern is overstated]{.mark}]{.underline}**. U.S.
entry into a grand bargain with China would undoubtedly send political
shockwaves throughout the Asia Pacific, but **[the United States could
take a variety of actions to demonstrate the strength of its continuing
commitments]{.underline}**. For example, **[it could [increase]{.mark}
the [capability of the forces it commits to the region and further
deepen joint U.S.- Japan military planning and high-level discussions on
the requirements for extended deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
fact, **[the United States has already begun taking some of these
measures.]{.underline}**

**[U.S. alliances are [likely to endure]{.mark} because its allies [do
not have options that are more appealing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, their need for security is likely to continue to grow as
China rises. **[Any doubts about U.S. reliability are likely to
[convince them to work harder to strengthen their alliances with the
United States]{.mark}, not to abandon it or to bandwagon with
China]{.underline}**.

### Deterrence

#### Arms aren't key to US deterrence

Options for the Future of the U.S.-Taiwan Defense Relationship September

https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship#full

Finally, **[stepping down from the commitment to defend Taiwan with
military force does not remove America's interest in keeping the Taiwan
Strait free of armed conflict. The United States would [retain the
ability to punish China]{.mark} in other ways should it attack Taiwan.
[Diplomatic isolation and economic sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}** may
not inflict the same kinds of costs on Beijing as military force, but
they [**[are additional costs that would have to be
absorbed]{.underline}**.]{.mark}104 Additionally, U.S. arms sales are
separate from the implicit commitment to defend Taiwan and could
continue, albeit in some reduced or modified form.105 Continuing to sell
arms to Taiwan while stepping down from the implicit commitment to use
military force to defend the island allows the United States to
demonstrate support for Taiwan's defense without taking on the risks
associated with direct intervention.106

#### Worse than squo - Any inclusion of high-tech weapons assures conflict -- breaks Chinese red-lines 

**[Panda 3/25]{.underline}** 2019 Ankit Panda, editor at The Diplomat
Are the US and China About to Face off Over American Fighter Sales to
Taiwan? If the Trump administration approves a recent request, it could
set up a major crisis. March 25, 2019
https://thediplomat.com/2019/03/are-the-us-and-china-about-to-face-off-over-american-fighter-sales-to-taiwan/

**[The [United States and China appear to be heading toward a major
confrontation over]{.mark} the]{.underline}** possible [**[sale of
American fighters to Taiwan]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Last week, Taiwanese President **[Tsai Ing-wen confirmed that the
country's Ministry of Defense had submitted a]{.underline}** formal
**[request to]{.underline}** Washington, D.C., to **[purchase F-16V
Viper fighters]{.underline}**. Tsai said the decision to make the
request was supported by a review of Taiwan's defense needs.

Days later, **[[Bloomberg News reported that the White House was poised
to approve the]{.underline}]{.mark}** Taiwanese
**[[request]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[If]{.underline}** that report is **[true, the United States would be
turning course]{.underline}** on what has been a longstanding reluctance
to sell fighters to Taiwan, even as it has authorized other arms sales
in line with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which requires the U.S.
government to support Taiwan "with arms of a defensive character."

Even as the Obama administration and the Trump administration have
approved weapons and spare parts for sale to Taiwan, [**[fighters have
long been seen as a bridge too far given Beijing serious
reservations]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

The United States authorized the sale of 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan in
1992. The Obama administration, after receiving a request from Taipei,
turned it down, initiating a set of upgrades instead to Taipei's
existing fleet.

The issue hasn't gone unnoticed in China, where Taiwan is seen as an
inherent part of the country. Relations across the Taiwan Strait have
been particularly strained since Tsai's inauguration in 2016.

The Taiwanese president hails from the independence-leaning Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), though she herself has not explicitly supported
independence --- long a red-line for Beijing --- Tsai, however, has
refused to endorse the so-called "1992 consensus," which her predecessor
had supported and which forms what Beijing sees as the baseline for
cordial cross-strait relations.

"**[[China's position to firmly oppose arms sales to Taiwan is
consistent and clear]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Geng Shuang said during a press briefing on Friday.

"**[We have made stern representations to the U.S. We have urged the
U.S. to fully recognize the sensitivity of this issue and the harm it
will cause]{.underline}**."

The prospect of **[a fighter sale to Taiwan]{.underline}** this time
**[comes at a time of]{.underline}** particularly **[heightened
U.S.-China tensions]{.underline}**. The Trump administration has been
known to seek leverage with Beijing across issues and it is possible
that this may turn into the latest case of Taiwan being used a possible
bargaining chip as Trump seeks to clinch a favorable trade deal with
Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump, however, has been unconventional on Taiwan policy in the past. As
president-elect, he broke expectations by receiving a telephone call
from Tsai. That call occurred at a time when Trump had yet to endorse
the United States' one-China policy as president --- something that he
did for the first time in February 2017.

Either way, **[Tsai's fighter request and the Trump administration's
reported acceptance could set up another major area of turbulence
between the United States and China.]{.underline}**

#### Arms do jack shit Taiwan is too far behind -- arms sales can't deter china -- only cause conflict 

**[Hua 15]{.underline}** Zhang Hua, assistant research fellow at the
Institute of Taiwan Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Global
Times Arms sales to Taiwan do not help the US
http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/959549.shtml

**[Washington]{.underline}** formally **[[announced a \$1.83 billion
arms sale package to Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Wednesday.
**[[China slammed the sale for interfering in its internal
affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}** and vowed to impose sanctions on relevant
American companies. **[Chinese pundits see this as new proof of
Washington\'s desire to contain China]{.underline}** by roiling
cross-Straits relations. In fact, **[arms sales to Taiwan have already
had a negative impact on the US]{.underline}**.

**[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}** has to accept it **[[is becoming
far less capable of containing China\'s rise.]{.mark} It may [upset the
government]{.mark} of the Chinese mainland by making a fuss with Taiwan,
[but it won\'t have a real effect.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Washington\'s primary intent in forging a military relationship with
Taiwan is to maintain military balance across the Taiwan Strait.
However, the strategy is stretched too thin. Given the mainland\'s swift
and prominent ramp-up in military spending, **[a military balance can no
longer be stricken between the mainland and Taiwan, [no matter how many
advanced weapons the US sells to Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The possibility of using Taiwan to suppress the
mainland\'s]{.underline}** growing **[leverage]{.underline}** in its
periphery **[is vanishing. The mainland\'s economic aggregate is more
than 20 times larger than Taiwan\'s, so the latter has no chance to
engage in a military race with the former.]{.underline}**

Selling arms to Taiwan doesn\'t mean Washington would hold on to its
promise to \"come and rescue\" Taiwan when the island is in trouble with
the mainland. It is not even a commitment to include Taiwan in its
umbrella of protection. Even some Taiwanese strategists have pointed out
that Taiwan is too obsessed with the delusion that Washington will come
all the way to defend Taiwan.

Washington also cunningly argues that the weaponry deal will bolster
Taiwan\'s confidence when it needs to negotiate with the mainland in
other respects. In fact, in such talks, it is always the mainland that
makes more room for Taiwan\'s wellbeing, not because Taiwan has a strong
military capability that is feared by the mainland, but because the
mainland regards Taiwan as family.

Although the US, especially its arms enterprises and political brokers,
could reap fat profits from such practices, these companies and
individuals might risk losing the second biggest market. The pros and
cons are not hard to weigh. In fact, some companies have started to
reflect on the deal.

Washington seems to have gone on the offensive in the arms deal, but
Beijing can find opportunities to strike back. From the Diaoyu Islands
to the South China Sea disputes, the US keeps stirring troubles against
China in recent years during the implementation of its \"rebalancing to
Asia\" strategy. China could have resorted to countermeasures but is too
prudent to take real action. On the occasion of this arms deal, for
which the US has neither moral nor legal ground, Beijing should take the
chance to carry out down-to-earth countermeasures, such as halting
bilateral communications over military matters and sanctioning relevant
US enterprises.

It becomes increasingly obvious that **[[playing the Taiwan card is no
longer an effective approach to countering China\'s
rise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On the contrary, **[it makes Washington
take bigger risks to jeopardize a relationship with the Chinese
mainland, which is clearly more important.]{.underline}**

#### Taiwan is the root cause of US-Sino trade tensions

sanctions on US firms over Taiwan arms sale,\",

**[[US companies involved in a potential arms sale worth \$2.2bn to
self-ruled Taiwan will face sanctions, China said,]{.mark} warning
Washington \"not to play with fire\".]{.underline}**

Taiwan on Saturday defended the weapons purchase saying it will
strengthen Taiwan\'s self-defence in the face of a growing military
threat from China.

\"The national army will continue to strengthen its key defence forces,
ensure national security, protect its homeland, and ensure that the
fruits of freedom and democracy won\'t be attacked,\" the defence
ministry said in a statement.

The planned weapons sale, the first transfer of big-ticket US military
gear to democratically governed Taiwan in decades, came as ties between
Washington and Beijing are already strained by a trade war.

**[\"[The US arms sale to Taiwan has severely violated the basic norms
of international law and international relations]{.mark},\" Chinese
foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement on
Friday.]{.underline}**

**[\"In order to safeguard national interests, China will impose
sanctions on US enterprises participating in this sale of weapons to
Taiwan,\" he said.]{.underline}**

Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during a visit to Hungary, asked the US to
\"recognise the gravity of the Taiwan question\".

[China, which views Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to one
day seize it, bristles at any country that lends the island state any
diplomatic support or legitimacy.]{.underline}

**[Even though Taiwan, which split from China following a civil war in
1949, doesn\'t have diplomatic ties with the US[, Washington provides
Taipei with military and other support. Beijing regards this as
interference in its internal affairs.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Trade war collapses the global economy

**[Jones 19]{.underline}** Marc Jones, 5-20-2019, \"Full-blown trade war
will push world toward recession,\" U.S.,
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-recession/full-blown-trade-war-will-push-world-toward-recession-morgan-stanley-idUSKCN1SQ1R4>
Lowell-SB

LONDON (Reuters) - A collapse of U.S.-China trade talks and hike in
tariffs on Chinese goods would push the world economy toward recession
and see the Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates back to zero within
a year, analysts at Morgan Stanley said on Monday.

Port, in northern China, May 16, 2019. REUTERS/Jason Lee

While a temporary escalation of trade tensions could be navigated
without much damage at all, a lasting breakdown would inflict serious
pain.

[["If talks stall, no deal is agreed upon and the U.S. imposes 25%
tariffs on the remaining circa \$300 billion of imports from China, we
see the global economy heading towards recession,"]{.mark} the bank's
analysts said in a note.]{.underline}

[In response, the Fed would cut rates all the way back to zero by spring
2020 while China would scale up its fiscal stimulus to 3.5% of GDP
(equivalent to around \$500 billion) and its broad credit growth target
to 14-15% a year, they added.]{.underline}

"But, a reactive policy response and the usual lags of policy
transmission would mean that we might not be able to avert the
tightening of financial conditions and a full-blown global recession."

A global recession is defined by growth dipping below the 2.5% a year
threshold.

[In a middle scenario where 25% tariffs on \$200 billion of U.S. imports
from China stay in place for 3-4 months, [global growth could slow
around 50 basis points to 2.7% a year.]{.mark}]{.underline}

They predicted the Fed would cut rates by 50 basis points to cushion the
blow while Beijing would up its total fiscal expansion to 2.25% of GDP,
or about \$320 billion.

Morgan Stanley's analyst also warned investors could be underestimating
the impact of trade tensions in a number of ways.

Firstly, the impact on the U.S. corporate sector would be more
widespread as China could put up non-tariff barriers such as restriction
of purchases.

[Given [the global growth slowdown that would follow, profits from
firms' international operations would be hit and companies would not be
able to fully pass through the tariff increases to
consumers.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The indirect impact would be "non-linear" too, with a sharp tightening
of financial conditions and policy uncertainty hitting firms' confidence
to the extent that they freeze or cutback on capital
expenditure.]{.underline}

"Our base case is that the escalation is temporary, but we would readily
admit that the uncertainty is high with regard to how trade talks could
evolve."

"The impact on global growth is non-linear -- the risks are firmly
skewed to the downside and the window for resolution is narrowing."

#### Econ decline causes global wars 

**[Liu 18]{.underline}** Qian Liu, China-based economist. "From economic
crisis to World War III." Project Syndicate. 11/8/2018.
<https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/economic-crisis-military-conflict-or-structural-reform-by-qian-liu-2018-11>

The next economic crisis is closer than you think. But what you should
really worry about is what comes after: **[in the current social,
political, and technological landscape[, a prolonged economic
crisis]{.mark}, combined with rising income inequality,
[could]{.mark}]{.underline}** well [**[escalate into a major global
military conflict]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

**[The]{.underline}** 20**[08]{.underline}**-09 global financial
**[crisis almost bankrupted governments and caused systemic
collapse]{.underline}**. **[Policymakers managed to pull the global
economy back]{.underline}** from the brink, **[using massive monetary
stimulus, including]{.underline}** **[q]{.underline}**uantitative
**[e]{.underline}**asing **[and]{.underline}**
near-**[zero]{.underline}** (**[or even negative]{.underline}**)
interest **[rates]{.underline}**.

But monetary stimulus is like an adrenaline shot to jump-start an
arrested heart; it can revive the patient, but it does nothing to cure
the disease. Treating a sick economy requires structural reforms, which
can cover everything from financial and labour markets to tax systems,
fertility patterns, and education policies.

Policymakers have utterly failed to pursue such reforms, despite
promising to do so. Instead, they have remained preoccupied with
politics. From Italy to Germany, forming and sustaining governments now
seems to take more time than actual governing. Greece, for example, has
relied on money from international creditors to keep its head (barely)
above water, rather than genuinely reforming its pension system or
improving its business environment.

The lack of structural reform has meant that the unprecedented excess
liquidity that central banks injected into their economies was not
allocated to its most efficient uses. Instead, it raised global asset
prices to levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008.

In the United States, housing prices are now 8% higher than they were at
the peak of the property bubble in 2006, according to the property
website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which measures
whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is now higher
than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great Depression in
1929.

As monetary tightening reveals the vulnerabilities in the real economy,
the collapse of asset-price bubbles will trigger another economic crisis
-- one that could be even more severe than the last, because we have
built up a tolerance to our strongest macroeconomic medications. A
decade of regular adrenaline shots, in the form of ultra-low interest
rates and unconventional monetary policies, has severely depleted their
power to stabilise and stimulate the economy.

If history is any guide, **[the consequences of this mistake could
extend far beyond the economy]{.underline}**. **[According to
Harvard's]{.underline}** **[Benjamin Friedman, prolonged [periods of
economic distress have been characterised]{.mark}]{.underline}** also
**[[by public antipathy toward minority groups or foreign countries
--]{.mark} attitudes that can help to fuel
[unrest]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[or even]{.underline}** **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

For example, **[during the Great Depression]{.underline}**, US President
Herbert **[Hoover signed]{.underline}** the 1930
**[Smoot-Hawley]{.underline}** Tariff Act, intended to protect American
workers and farmers from foreign competition. In the subsequent five
years, global trade shrank by two-thirds. **[Within a decade, World War
II had begun]{.underline}**.

To be sure, WWII, like World War I, was caused by a multitude of
factors; there is no standard path to war. But there is reason to
believe that high levels of inequality can play a significant role in
stoking conflict.

**[According to research by]{.underline}** the economist Thomas
**[Piketty, a spike in income inequality is often followed by a great
crisis]{.underline}**. Income inequality then declines for a while,
before rising again, until a new peak -- and a new disaster. Though
causality has yet to be proven, given the limited number of data points,
this correlation should not be taken lightly, especially with wealth and
income inequality at historically high levels.

This is all the more worrying in view of the numerous other factors
stoking social unrest and diplomatic tension, including technological
disruption, a record-breaking migration crisis, anxiety over
globalisation, political polarisation, and rising nationalism. All are
symptoms of failed policies that could turn out to be trigger points for
a future crisis.

Voters have good reason to be frustrated, but the **[emotionally
appealing populists]{.underline}** to whom they are increasingly giving
their support are offering ill-advised solutions that **[will only make
matters worse]{.underline}**. For example, **[despite the world's
unprecedented interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being
eschewed]{.underline}**, as countries -- most notably, Donald J.
**[Trump's US -- pursue unilateral, isolationist
policies]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, **[proxy wars are raging in Syria
and Yemen]{.underline}**.

Against this background, **[we must take seriously the possibility that
[the next economic crisis could lead to a large-scale military
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By the logic of the political
scientist Samuel Huntington, considering such a scenario could help us
avoid it because it would force us to take action. In this case, the key
will be for policymakers to pursue the structural reforms that they have
long promised while replacing finger-pointing and antagonism with a
sensible and respectful global dialogue. The alternative may well be
global conflagration.

#### Arms sales to Taiwan don't matter for the defense industrial base 

**[Hallinan 11]{.underline}** (Conn - columnist for Foreign Policy In

Bi-polar diplomacy anyone? It is clear that **[Washington and Beijing
are of two minds about their relationship. Both are riding conflicting
internal political currents]{.underline}**, and over the next decade,
**[threading a path between cooperation and competition promises to be
tricky. Arms sales accomplish little more than pushing China's
nationalist button. [The jobs they create in the U.S. are
marginal]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[(and [the same amount spent on
civilian projects produce more employment), and the tensions they create
are real.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It is time to revisit the 1979 Taiwan
Relations Act, a piece of legislation that reflects a very different
world than the one we live in now.

#### DIB is declining -- too dependent on foreign nations

**[Green, 10-5-18]{.underline}** (Jeff Green, staff writer at Defense
News, a global website and magazine about politics, business and
technology of defense, "The decline of the defense industrial base --
and what to do about it", Defense News) //GB

A [new report]{.underline} released [by the White House documents the
[gravity of the situation facing the defense industrial
base]{.mark}]{.underline}, while also offering solutions to counteract
these challenges. [By evaluating seven tiers deep into the supply chain,
[the report has documented more than 280 major supply chain
vulnerabilities and an alarming dependency on foreign nations,]{.mark}
especially China]{.underline}. The report is not all bad news, however:
it notes that a targeted approach involving funding, policy,
legislation, and regulation could combat these declines and
significantly improve the outlook for American defense production.

Keen [observers of the defense industrial base have noticed many of the
problems]{.underline} identified by the report, classified into ten
different "archetypes," for years. Foreign dependencies abound within
the defense supply chain, especially at the "sub-tier" levels of
component or raw material manufacturing. Even when the U.S. military is
not entirely dependent on a foreign source for these supplies, it is
often the case that a sole source or a single source, often fragile, is
the only remaining producer of the material. These risks are among those
clearly identified by the report, which offers solutions to help them,
ranging from additional funding to keep domestic manufacturers in
business to sourcing restrictions, such as the proven Berry and
Specialty Metals amendments, that protect manufacturers from hostile
foreign acts.

In addressing [the prevalence of [hostile foreign trade
practices]{.mark} and other strategies designed to produce foreign
dependence and [weaken the American industrial
base]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} the report goes further than the
Department of Defense has traditionally wanted to venture. The [report
clearly identifies five macro factors that have weakened the defense
industrial base]{.underline}, including the "Industrial Policies of
Competitor Nations." Though [U.S. manufacturing has declined for a
variety of reasons]{.underline}, the report notes that [China, in
particular, has used illegal means to dominate critical global
markets]{.underline}. These means include espionage, evasion of export
controls, market access restrictions, subsidies, and dumping, among
others.

#### Link turn---reduced arms sales is good for the defense industrial base---causes an increase in domestic procurement, which leads to higher quality defense investments 

**[García-Alonso 7]{.underline}** (Maria D.C. -- Lecturer in Economics
at The University of Kent & Paul Levine -- Professor of Economics at The
University of Surrey, "Arms Trade and Arms Races: A Strategic Analysis,"
p. 26-27,
https://www.kent.ac.uk/economics/documents/GES%20Background%20Documents/Defence/Garcia-Alonso&Levine%20Handbook.pdf)

This framework can be used to examine how **[[the size of the defence
industrial base is influenced by the degree of home bias for domestic
production]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the parameter ws), **[R&D costs which
determine the quality]{.underline}** qsj **[of system]{.underline}** j,
**[export controls]{.underline}** captured by usj **[and the nature of
regional arms races.]{.underline}** Collective action problems relating
to possible cooperation between suppliers in procurement, R&D and export
control decisions can also be addressed with this framework. Figures 2
and 3 taken from Dunne et al. (2005) illustrate some insights provided
by this model. We examine in these results a symmetric equilibrium in
which all producer countries are identical in every respect and
similarly for non-producers. The utility function across producers and
cost conditions for firms are identical. The consequence of this is that
procurement prices and firm numbers in each country are all equal. In
Figure 2 the endogenously determined number of firms in this symmetrical
equilibrium is shown as a function of the R&D cost parameter β. This
figure shows how **[[there exists a trade-off between quality and
variety]{.underline}]{.mark}**: **[an increase in a cost
parameter]{.underline}** β **[increases barriers to entry and inhibits
the emergence of new firms and varieties]{.underline}** (since each firm
produces a single variety in our set-up). **[Quality and R&D costs as a
percentage of total costs falls with firms switching from quality to
quantity.]{.underline}** **[Figure 2]{.underline}** also **[demonstrates
two effects of cooperation: the reduction of duplication in R&D
investment and the increase in varieties.]{.underline}** **[The latter
occurs under cooperation because variety produced in each supplier
country enters the utility of other producers as a positive
externality.]{.underline}** In Figure 3 the endogenous number of firms
in a symmetric equilibrium is plotted against the home bias parameter w
∈ \[0.5, 1\]. The fall in w from its value under autarky, w = 1, to the
no home bias case, w = 0.5, can be seen as one aspect of the
globalization of the international defence industry as countries are
more willing to look to imports to provide for their military needs.
Again **[[procurement cooperation increases variety and reduces R&D
investment compared with non-cooperation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Furthermore under cooperation, changes in home bias has no effect as it
is internalized in the cooperative decision. **[[With
non-cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as **[[home bias increases the
willingness to invest in both quality and variety
rises]{.underline}]{.mark}**

(since there is less scope for importing these features). However in the
vicinity of the no bias value w = 0.5, the R&D-variety trade-off sees
more R&D investment at the expense of variety so firm numbers initially
fall. As w increases further, the convex nature of R&D costs means that
at some value (around w = 0.7) in Figure 3) the increase in R&D drops
off and variety starts to increase. The prediction of the model then is
for values of home bias w near the autarky value,
[**[globalization]{.underline}**]{.mark} (a reduction in w) **[[causes
firm numbers to fall and]{.mark} thus [international market
concentration to increase.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The model can also
predict that if quality and R&D expenditure are held fixed or indeed
rise, then globalization in another sense of an increased relative size
of the external market and greater willingness to export higher quality
weapons will reduce the number of firms. Taken together our results then
provide an explanation for the driving forces behind the recent
increases in concentration in the defence industry (see Dunne et al.,
2003) .

#### DIB will inevitably collapse -- uncertainty and workforce

**[Interagency Task Force September 2018]{.underline}** (task force
found to investigate DIB, Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing
and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United
States)

**[At the microeconomic level, [DoD's budget within a specific sector
does not imply uniform, stable, or even predictable funding for
suppliers]{.mark}. Such uncertainty creates negative ramifications
within specific industrial base sectors, even in periods with overall
growth in spending]{.underline}**. **[For example, when the Navy is
unable to provide consistent orders for ships, niche suppliers of
components such as controllers and actuators for nuclear powered ships
cannot accurately project workloads, creating inconsistency and
increasing risk for production capabilities]{.underline}**. Wrought
aluminum plate, and specifically cold-rolled plate, is essential for
armoring U.S. ground combat vehicles, constructing Navy ships, and
building military aircraft. Unlike other more common forms of rolled
aluminum materials, thick cold-rolled aluminum production capabilities
and capacities are unique. DoD relies on domestic producers as well as
capabilities available from ally countries in Europe**[. Due [to U.S.
Government budget uncertainties, unpredictable DoD demand, and other
commercial market factors, the defense industrial base can face
challenges when trying to balance diverse demands for cold-rolled plate
production capacity while also informing long-term internal capital
investment decisions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Challenges facing the
ground systems sector illustrate the relationship between budget
uncertainty and diminishing workforce skills. Ground systems provide
defense-unique products for mobility and firepower and are divided into
tracked and wheeled vehicles for combat, combat support, and combat
service support.]{.underline}** **[Under the weight of budget
uncertainties, the ground systems industrial base conducted incremental
adoption of new technologies on legacy designs in order to maintain or
modify current ground systems]{.underline}**. **[While this approach
allowed the military to defer the long schedules and high costs of new
programs, it prevented ground systems development and maintenance
personnel from experiencing the design to fielding lifecycle for a new
system. This resulted in a generation of technicians, engineers, and
scientists lacking experience in conceiving, designing, constructing,
and integrating technologically advanced combat vehicles.]{.underline}**

**[The [continued operations in foreign countries create
new]{.mark}]{.underline}** pressures and **[[difficulties]{.mark}
[for]{.mark}]{.underline}** these
**[[corporations]{.underline}]{.mark}**.93 It is not that they are just
American companies, but that their **[[operations are tied to]{.mark}
the [political ramifications]{.mark} of being a defense corporation and
a national asset to their host nation]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[the
continual operation of these corporations in multiple nations raises the
likelihood that political confrontation between the foreign nations and
the corporation may occur]{.underline}**.94 **[The [response from the
PRC]{.mark} over the sales to Taiwan [highlights that]{.mark} exact
[problem]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Considering that all the [defense corporations from the Taiwan arms
sale are multinational]{.mark}]{.underline}** in their operations
**[[and have civilian sectors]{.underline}]{.mark}** that extend the
globe, **[[China has an ability to sanction portions of the exposed
civilian sectors]{.mark} of the defense corporations]{.underline}**.95
Unlike the defense sectors, **[civilian sectors look at foreign areas as
a new market in which to gain new customers]{.underline}**.96 Therefore,
to be able to understand the effectiveness of sanctions against the
civilian sectors, it is important to register how much these **[[defense
corporations rely on their civilian sectors]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
how much of a role China plays in the calculus of their future prospect.

In analyzing Table 2, **[one can see that both Boeing and UTC show a
large reliance on their civilian sector]{.underline}**. According to
their financial data, **[both companies rely heavily upon their civilian
sectors' total revenue to maintain operations]{.underline}**. Lockheed
Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon have a significant amount of
civilian revenue; however, their business structure does not rely as
heavily on civilian revenue and would therefore not be in as much
jeopardy if sanctions were imposed on their civilian sectors. **[For
Boeing and UTC, 49% and 83% are sufficiently significant that they
require their civilian sectors' revenue and would, therefore, be
extremely vulnerable to the Chinese sanctions.]{.underline}**

**[Boeing sells commercial aircraft to the Chinese Airlines and UTC
sells Otis elevators and Carrier brand heating and air-conditioning in
China]{.underline}**.98 For Boeing, **[a complication in the Chinese
market would severely hurt their civilian revenue]{.underline}**. Over
the next two decades, **[Boeing expects China to spend \$400 billion to
purchase around 3,770 planes from certain manufacturers, therefore
making China the second largest commercial aircraft market in the
world]{.underline}**.99 According to UTC's CEO, Louis Chenevert,
"\[China's market\] feels really good right now," adding that he sees no
evidence of China's market slowing down and noted that the company's
Otis elevators were up by double digits, and orders for its Carrier air
conditioning systems were "starting to come up." **[For UTC, the revenue
from Otis Corporation accounted for the bulk of the \$3.1 billion in
sales in China last year, and it is estimated that China's economy will
grow 9.9 percent this year]{.underline}**.100 With results and high
expectations for both companies, and a large reliance on their civilian
sector's total revenue to maintain operations, **[it appears as though
these two defense corporations have a large reliance on the civilian
Chinese market and would, therefore, be highly vulnerable to Chinese
sanctions.]{.underline}**

This is not to say that effective sanctions on the civilian sectors of
Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin would not have a profound
affect on these corporations. Referring back to the findings of Jonathan
Galloway, these corporations regardless of percentage, will take the
necessary actions to rebalance the equilibrium between the three
markets: Governmental, Domestic Civilian, and Foreign.101 It is hard to
fathom any corporation willingly taking hits on their overall revenue.
While Raytheon only receives 7% of their total revenue from their
civilian sector, this still amounts to \$1.6 billion, which is no small
amount.

While civilian revenue for these three corporations is significant,
their overall civilian operations in China are minimal as compared to
UTC and Boeing. In this case, both UTC and Boeing depend on the Chinese
market to make sales and purchases. Their dependence on the Chinese
economy goes beyond that of supply chains and logistics, but also
depends on consumer buying and open markets. This dependence separates
them from the others in that they have become more vulnerable to the
PRC.

**[If [China does impose]{.mark}]{.underline}** the threatened
**[[sanctions]{.mark} against these DMNCs it could prove to be
detrimental to their international operations]{.underline}**. While the
military sectors of these defense corporations would not be affected by
sanctions from China, considering that China does not buy U.S. weapons,
**[the civilian sectors are left relatively unprotected]{.underline}**.
The combined dynamics of a large reliance on civilian revenue and
pressure from a government that has a lucrative market for their
civilian sectors to operate in, only demonstrates a larger possibility
that certain defense corporations will be more likely to adhere to the
foreign government's will over that of their host national government's
desires.

2\. Exploitation by Use of Foreign Competitors

Another way in which China can exploit a major weakness in certain
civilian sectors of the defense corporations is through pre-existing
competitive rivalries. In most cases, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon,
UTC, Northrop Grumman and other defense corporations are in tight
contention for defense contracts relating in their respective fields,
however, as was discussed, China does not have an ability to affect
this. There are **[pre-existing rivalries in the civilian
sectors]{.underline}** that **[can be exploited to create even more
pressure on]{.underline}** the defense corporations involved in the
**[Taiwan arms sale]{.underline}**.

**[The [targeting of corporations]{.mark} with strong rivals
can]{.underline}** serve two purposes: it can **[[cause civilian
revenue]{.mark} of the defense corporations [to
decrease]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and increase the competitive gain of
their key competitor. Not only do they lose that part of the market, but
**[their competitor also ends up gaining from it, therefore delivering a
double blow to the defense corporation under fire]{.underline}**. In
tight competition for new markets like China, **[this sort of
altercation can result in a major setback]{.underline}** to the defense
corporation's civilian revenue **[and could become a crippling long-term
effect. Not only does the rival gain from a sanction in China,
but]{.underline}** also, **[due to the increased capital, the rival will
have the ability to use this gain in other competitive areas to help
increase funding in their global market.]{.underline}**

There are many different types of rivalries that exist in the market.
Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman mainly compete with each
other for defense contracts and their civilian revenue is relatively low
as compared to others. This, therefore, indicates that they are somewhat
protected from a Chinese exploitation of the key rivalries between them.

Conglomerate corporations might have several different rivals by the
existence of multiple sectors and markets under which they operate.
Therefore no one company is completely identical to that of another
conglomerate corporation and the existence of a specific rivalry is
rare. UTC is a conglomerate that has different civilian sectors like
Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioners.102 The sanctions against
UTC would result in fewer Otis elevators and Carrier products; however,
there are many different elevator and air-conditioner companies
operating in China and, therefore, no specific competitor would gain
from such sanctions. This therefore does not affect the global
competitiveness of the civilian sector of UTC but only local
competitiveness in the Chinese market. Therefore, the sanctions will not
make UTC as vulnerable.

Boeing on the other hand has one major rival, Airbus. As most would
claim, the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus is the largest
international rivalry in the world.103 Both companies are identical in
that their civilian sectors develop comparable commercial aircrafts that
are competitive on the global market. Foreign corporations that choose
to buy a commercial jet are usually considering whether or not they
choose Airbus or Boeing and at times will use the two corporations to
play off each other in a bidding war. The stakes are extremely high for
each corporation being that a single deal with an airline could be a
deciding factor between success and failure over a multibilliondollar
investment.104 Therefore, one of the best strategies for both Boeing and
Airbus is that of persuading prospective buyers such as nationally owned
airlines (as is the case in China), to purchase their planes over the
others.105

a\. Boeing Versus Airbus in China

The competition between Boeing and Airbus has been extremely tight over
the years. Neither company has been able to pull away from the other, so
the slightest change in their global market share gives each company a
comparable advantage over the other. For such a close race, it can be
seen how important the Chinese market is to both companies. According to
China's own projections, they believe they will quadruple their aircraft
fleet to 3,900 by 2025, which will create a large amount of potential
revenue for either Boeing or Airbus.106 To further this, Boeing expects
China to spend over \$400 billion to purchase planes over the next
couple of years, thus making China the second largest aeronautics market
in the world.107 China "probably has the most potential of any
significant market in the world," said the Airbus China President
Laurence Barron.108

However, with such a tight contention, is Boeing at a point that they
can handle a head-to-head challenge with Airbus in China, especially if
sanctions are involved? With airlines in other markets struggling, and
Boeing itself still trying to recover from its much-delayed Dreamliner
787 project, Boeing seems to be on shaky ground and stands to lose more
than Airbus.109 Along with this, before the arms sales to Taiwan, Airbus
was already winning more orders from China than Boeing.110

While Boeing currently has 736 Boeing planes operating in China (and
another 30 from McDonnell-Douglas, which Boeing-acquired in 1997),
Airbus only has 547. However, over the past couple of years, Airbus's
orders from China have dramatically shifted to give Airbus the
advantage. As of February 2010, Chinese airlines have placed orders for
358 Airbus planes and have options for another 14, while they have only
ordered 244 new planes from Boeing and have placed no options for
further units. Airbus has also acquired letters of intent towards future
sales of 60 planes, compared to 40 for Boeing.111

Because the three largest airline companies (China Southern, China
Eastern, and Air China) are still controlled by the Chinese government,
the purchasing of commercial airliners is highly politicized where
government officials have the ability to reward foreign governments with
airplane sales that meet the interests of China.112 In response to such
a system, Airbus, in June 2008, built an assembly base in Tianjin.113 By
developing an assembly factory in Tianjin, Airbus is hoping that
building aircraft in China (and the corresponding transfer of
technology) will strengthen its position with the Chinese government to
a better one than that of Boeing. To further this, Airbus has also
developed an engineering center in Beijing that will train up to 200
local engineers to assist in the plant operations in Tianjin.114 In
China, "if you allow for more local production and information-sharing,
the purchaser is going to be a lot more willing to accept your
aircraft," says Peter Harbison, executive chairman of the Center for
Asia Pacific Aviation in Sydney.115

Boeing on the other hand is at a disadvantage. Hindered by unions and
concerns of the company shifting jobs overseas, Boeing has had to
maintain production in the United States. However, Boeing has argued
that their presence in China is significant because Boeing buys parts
from seven local manufacturers in China. Boeing spokesman, Yukui Wang,
stated that Boeing is the Chinese aviation industry's largest foreign
customer. He stresses that Boeing, over the years, has bought \$1.5
billion in aircraft parts and services from China and that this figure
"will double in the next few years... Chinese suppliers now have a role
in all of Boeing airplanes."116 To emphasize their commitment to China,
Boeing ramped up its efforts and sent a sales director to Beijing to
become the company's first China-based sales executive---which is
something that is not normally practiced by Boeing.117

Even with the past level of competition between Boeing and Airbus,
**[Boeing is now at a large disadvantage because of their defense
sector's sales of]{.underline}** the Harpoon **[missiles to Taiwan. If
China enacts the sanctions]{.underline}** against Boeing, **[Boeing will
have to face a strong rival who just became stronger, while they lost
major ground in the battle over the Chinese market]{.underline}**. Even
if China does not impose the sanctions, **[the Chinese government will
probably be more likely to purchase planes from, and therefore support a
company that does not sell weapons to areas of concern and complies with
their national interests]{.underline}**.

The defense corporations that are more reliant on their defense sales
and, therefore, are not as competitive in the civilian sectors, such as
Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin, are not under the same
kind of pressure to expand their international production base and
depend on foreign markets as is Boeing (due to their competitive nature
with Airbus). If China were to take sanctions against Boeing, they would
be able to meet their aeronautical needs by buying planes from Airbus,
who is Boeing's tight competitor. Therefore not only is Boeing losing
the revenue, but their main competitor is gaining from the sanctions.
This double-edged sword would increase pressure on Boeing to try and
mitigate the sanctions and adhere to the Chinese request, thereby
restoring their share of the world market and their political favor in
the eyes of the Chinese government.

C. CONCLUDING ANALYSIS

In this section, we have explored the possible vulnerabilities due to
foreign subcontracting, and civilian operations internationally. It was
shown that **[foreign subcontracting is not only prevalent in defense
operations but that there is no clear way of demarking and tracking
exactly where all parts and pieces are made and assembled.
This]{.underline}** is alarming in that it **[opens opportunities for
foreign meddling and highlights a lack of understand on how truly the
defense sector depends on foreign supplies and
assistance]{.underline}**. It is only clear that levels of dependency do
exist and that the controls in place are inadequate to exactly track
such vulnerabilities.

#### Manufacturing solves war -- key to overall military strategy

As the past decade has shown, [the United States **can be quickly drawn
into conflicts around the world**. To be prepared, **[our country must
maintain a]{.mark} strong and skilled [defense manufacturing
industry]{.mark} to support the production of the equipment our troops
need**. But [this defense base]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the]{.underline}
skilled [[jobs]{.mark} it provides [are in]{.mark}]{.underline} grave
[[danger]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Between 1998 and 2010, the country lost 57,000 manufacturing facilities
and 6 million manufacturing jobs. [If this trend continues, there is a
very real risk that we will permanently lose the skills required to make
much-needed equipment for the U.S. military and will need to look
overseas for suppliers.]{.underline}

As former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned earlier this year, \"The
last damn thing we need if we face a crisis is to somehow contract out
that responsibility to another country. So [we have to maintain the core
industrial base that we need. **[The skills are essential to our ability
to maintain a strong national defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

A prime example of this danger to both our economy and national security
is the threatened shutdown of the Bradley Industrial Base, consisting of
the York, Pa., facility where BAE Systems manufactures the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle and the suppliers that support the program.

Built to protect and transport troops, the armored vehicle is the
workhorse of the U.S. Army and the embodiment of American defense
industrial base know-how and engineering: The vehicle\'s advanced
aluminium armor and weapons systems are produced by 7,000 skilled
workers in 586 businesses across 44 states.

Now, in an attempt to modernize the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and
lasting at least three years. [With production halted]{.underline}, the
businesses that make up the Bradley Industrial Base will be unable to
employ the highly skilled workers who produce the specialized parts that
keep these vehicles running. [Thousands of workers will lose their jobs,
and some will move on to other fields, while their skills - unique to
building combat vehicles - will become lost or obsolete. As a result,
our armed forces may end up going into harm\'s way without equipment
manufactured in America and ready for today\'s battlefield]{.underline}.

[Since World War II, our military - and all Americans - have relied on a
highly skilled, dedicated and engaged civilian defense labor force of
engineers, designers, welders, electricians, machinists and pipe
fitters]{.underline}. Like a well-prepared combat team, [this labor
force]{.underline} - nearly 625,000 people - [is continuously training
in order to maintain their technological superiority. As new
technologies are developed to address the ever-changing threats from our
enemy, this labor force acquires new skills to keep pace and meet the
military\'s needs]{.underline}.

[Now these workers]{.underline}, the products they make, the incomes
their families and communities depend on [and America\'s ability to
defend itself are all at risk]{.underline}.

As a nation, [we must make it a priority to ensure the strength of the
Army\'s combat vehicle program and the skilled defense industrial base
jobs that support this crucial capability. The Army can
help]{.underline} the Bradley Industrial Base [in the near term simply
by spending the \$288 million provided last year to allow industry to
perform its requirements, which ensure that older vehicles are
upgraded]{.underline} with the latest technology our troops need.

[In the longer term, the Army should work with industry to ensure that
our troops can meet the missions they might face, while providing
industry with the stability to sustain the skilled jobs needed to
respond to future]{.underline}.

**[Dwindling [budgets and]{.mark} the desire [for short-term financial
gains are threatening America\'s \"arsenal of democracy\"]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} with it our [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The skilled
men and women of the defense manufacturing industry do work that allows
us to fly the red, white and blue, and they must not be pink-slipped.
[[Equipping our military is]{.mark} [too important to
outsource]{.mark} - our economy, our national security and our fellow
Americans count on it]{.underline}.

#### Reducing arms sales doesn't affect US economy

**[Caverley, 4-6-18]{.underline}** (Jonathan Caverley, Political science
researcher at MIT, US Naval College professor, and Author at War on the
Rocks, specializing in global arms trade, "America's arm sales policy:
Security abroad, not hobs at home, War on the Rocks) //GB

However, the Trump administration's new initiative threatens to disrupt
this balance and undermine the often useful role that arms sales have
played in U.S. foreign policy. Tina Kaidanow, head of the State
Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, recently
testified that the Arms Transfer Initiative not only "bolsters our
ability to protect the United States by being a force multiplier for the
U.S. warfighter" but "ultimately benefits U.S. industry by driving new
innovation and creating high-quality American jobs." But simultaneously
[[linking U.S. security and American jobs through arms
sales]{.underline},]{.mark} while it may seem intuitive[, [rarely
works]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, [such a [policy will carry few
economic benefits]{.mark}, and, if done]{.underline} indiscriminately,
[[undermine]{.mark} what should be the central goal of the nation's arms
transfer policy: advancing the [national security of the United
States]{.mark} and its partners]{.underline}. [Many deals that advance
U.S. goals will create few jobs in the United States]{.underline}, while
some of the most lucrative, job-creating arms deals can undermine U.S.
interests.

[The [arms market is a surprisingly tiny portion of world
trade]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Annual estimates range from \$86 to 105
billion dollars]{.underline}.

 [Compare this to the global
markets](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/02/the-top-importers-and-exporters-of-the-world-s-18-most-traded-goods?utm_content=buffere3d41&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) for
cars (\$1.35 trillion), pharmaceuticals (\$613 billion), and even "human
or animal blood" (\$252 billion) [and the international arms industry
begins to look paltry]{.underline}.

By any estimate, [the United States already dominates this
industry]{.underline}. The State Department's own estimates for 2015
credit the United States with a whopping 80 percent of the financial
value of all global arms deliveries from 2013 to 2017. [The most
authoritative source of data, the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute, gives the United States a more conservative, but still
commanding, lead of 34 percent of arms deliveries]{.underline} (measured
according to an index of military, rather than financial, value) for the
same time period. [Russia comes in at second place with 22
percent]{.underline}, with the next four leading states scrapping for 5
to 7 percent each.

Easing regulations on sales to existing American customers is unlikely
to have a huge effect on the size of these transactions, and even with
relaxed rules, finding new state customers will be hard. [Much of the
remaining market is essentially closed to the United
States]{.underline}. With the crucial exception of India, [there is
little opportunity to encroach upon the market share of the number two
weapons exporter --- Russia --- since the United States
restricts]{.underline} or bans [sales of weapons to important Russian
customers]{.underline} like China, Venezuela, Syria, and Vietnam.

but]{.underline}** also, **[due to the increased capital, the rival will
have the ability to use this gain in other competitive areas to help
increase funding in their global market.]{.underline}**

There are many different types of rivalries that exist in the market.
Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman mainly compete with each
other for defense contracts and their civilian revenue is relatively low
as compared to others. This, therefore, indicates that they are somewhat
protected from a Chinese exploitation of the key rivalries between them.

Conglomerate corporations might have several different rivals by the
existence of multiple sectors and markets under which they operate.
Therefore no one company is completely identical to that of another
conglomerate corporation and the existence of a specific rivalry is
rare. UTC is a conglomerate that has different civilian sectors like
Otis elevators and Carrier air-conditioners.102 The sanctions against
UTC would result in fewer Otis elevators and Carrier products; however,
there are many different elevator and air-conditioner companies
operating in China and, therefore, no specific competitor would gain
from such sanctions. This therefore does not affect the global
competitiveness of the civilian sector of UTC but only local
competitiveness in the Chinese market. Therefore, the sanctions will not
make UTC as vulnerable.

Boeing on the other hand has one major rival, Airbus. As most would
claim, the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus is the largest
international rivalry in the world.103 Both companies are identical in
that their civilian sectors develop comparable commercial aircrafts that
are competitive on the global market. Foreign corporations that choose
to buy a commercial jet are usually considering whether or not they
choose Airbus or Boeing and at times will use the two corporations to
play off each other in a bidding war. The stakes are extremely high for
each corporation being that a single deal with an airline could be a
deciding factor between success and failure over a multibilliondollar
investment.104 Therefore, one of the best strategies for both Boeing and
Airbus is that of persuading prospective buyers such as nationally owned
airlines (as is the case in China), to purchase their planes over the
others.105

a\. Boeing Versus Airbus in China

The competition between Boeing and Airbus has been extremely tight over
the years. Neither company has been able to pull away from the other, so
the slightest change in their global market share gives each company a
comparable advantage over the other. For such a close race, it can be
seen how important the Chinese market is to both companies. According to
China's own projections, they believe they will quadruple their aircraft
fleet to 3,900 by 2025, which will create a large amount of potential
revenue for either Boeing or Airbus.106 To further this, Boeing expects
China to spend over \$400 billion to purchase planes over the next
couple of years, thus making China the second largest aeronautics market
in the world.107 China "probably has the most potential of any
significant market in the world," said the Airbus China President
Laurence Barron.108

However, with such a tight contention, is Boeing at a point that they
can handle a head-to-head challenge with Airbus in China, especially if
sanctions are involved? With airlines in other markets struggling, and
Boeing itself still trying to recover from its much-delayed Dreamliner
787 project, Boeing seems to be on shaky ground and stands to lose more
than Airbus.109 Along with this, before the arms sales to Taiwan, Airbus
was already winning more orders from China than Boeing.110

While Boeing currently has 736 Boeing planes operating in China (and
another 30 from McDonnell-Douglas, which Boeing-acquired in 1997),
Airbus only has 547. However, over the past couple of years, Airbus's
orders from China have dramatically shifted to give Airbus the
advantage. As of February 2010, Chinese airlines have placed orders for
358 Airbus planes and have options for another 14, while they have only
ordered 244 new planes from Boeing and have placed no options for
further units. Airbus has also acquired letters of intent towards future
sales of 60 planes, compared to 40 for Boeing.111

Because the three largest airline companies (China Southern, China
Eastern, and Air China) are still controlled by the Chinese government,
the purchasing of commercial airliners is highly politicized where
government officials have the ability to reward foreign governments with
airplane sales that meet the interests of China.112 In response to such
a system, Airbus, in June 2008, built an assembly base in Tianjin.113 By
developing an assembly factory in Tianjin, Airbus is hoping that
building aircraft in China (and the corresponding transfer of
technology) will strengthen its position with the Chinese government to
a better one than that of Boeing. To further this, Airbus has also
developed an engineering center in Beijing that will train up to 200
local engineers to assist in the plant operations in Tianjin.114 In
China, "if you allow for more local production and information-sharing,
the purchaser is going to be a lot more willing to accept your
aircraft," says Peter Harbison, executive chairman of the Center for
Asia Pacific Aviation in Sydney.115

Boeing on the other hand is at a disadvantage. Hindered by unions and
concerns of the company shifting jobs overseas, Boeing has had to
maintain production in the United States. However, Boeing has argued
that their presence in China is significant because Boeing buys parts
from seven local manufacturers in China. Boeing spokesman, Yukui Wang,
stated that Boeing is the Chinese aviation industry's largest foreign
customer. He stresses that Boeing, over the years, has bought \$1.5
billion in aircraft parts and services from China and that this figure
"will double in the next few years... Chinese suppliers now have a role
in all of Boeing airplanes."116 To emphasize their commitment to China,
Boeing ramped up its efforts and sent a sales director to Beijing to
become the company's first China-based sales executive---which is
something that is not normally practiced by Boeing.117

Even with the past level of competition between Boeing and Airbus,
**[Boeing is now at a large disadvantage because of their defense
sector's sales of]{.underline}** the Harpoon **[missiles to Taiwan. If
China enacts the sanctions]{.underline}** against Boeing, **[Boeing will
have to face a strong rival who just became stronger, while they lost
major ground in the battle over the Chinese market]{.underline}**. Even
if China does not impose the sanctions, **[the Chinese government will
probably be more likely to purchase planes from, and therefore support a
company that does not sell weapons to areas of concern and complies with
their national interests]{.underline}**.

The defense corporations that are more reliant on their defense sales
and, therefore, are not as competitive in the civilian sectors, such as
Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, and Lockheed Martin, are not under the same
kind of pressure to expand their international production base and
depend on foreign markets as is Boeing (due to their competitive nature
with Airbus). If China were to take sanctions against Boeing, they would
be able to meet their aeronautical needs by buying planes from Airbus,
who is Boeing's tight competitor. Therefore not only is Boeing losing
the revenue, but their main competitor is gaining from the sanctions.
This double-edged sword would increase pressure on Boeing to try and
mitigate the sanctions and adhere to the Chinese request, thereby
restoring their share of the world market and their political favor in
the eyes of the Chinese government.

C. CONCLUDING ANALYSIS

In this section, we have explored the possible vulnerabilities due to
foreign subcontracting, and civilian operations internationally. It was
shown that **[foreign subcontracting is not only prevalent in defense
operations but that there is no clear way of demarking and tracking
exactly where all parts and pieces are made and assembled.
This]{.underline}** is alarming in that it **[opens opportunities for
foreign meddling and highlights a lack of understand on how truly the
defense sector depends on foreign supplies and
assistance]{.underline}**. It is only clear that levels of dependency do
exist and that the controls in place are inadequate to exactly track
such vulnerabilities.

As the past decade has shown, [the United States **can be quickly drawn
into conflicts around the world**. To be prepared, **[our country must
maintain a]{.mark} strong and skilled [defense manufacturing
industry]{.mark} to support the production of the equipment our troops
need**. But [this defense base]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the]{.underline}
skilled [[jobs]{.mark} it provides [are in]{.mark}]{.underline} grave
[[danger]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Between 1998 and 2010, the country lost 57,000 manufacturing facilities
and 6 million manufacturing jobs. [If this trend continues, there is a
very real risk that we will permanently lose the skills required to make
much-needed equipment for the U.S. military and will need to look
overseas for suppliers.]{.underline}

As former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned earlier this year, \"The
last damn thing we need if we face a crisis is to somehow contract out
that responsibility to another country. So [we have to maintain the core
industrial base that we need. **[The skills are essential to our ability
to maintain a strong national defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

A prime example of this danger to both our economy and national security
is the threatened shutdown of the Bradley Industrial Base, consisting of
the York, Pa., facility where BAE Systems manufactures the Bradley
Fighting Vehicle and the suppliers that support the program.

Built to protect and transport troops, the armored vehicle is the
workhorse of the U.S. Army and the embodiment of American defense
industrial base know-how and engineering: The vehicle\'s advanced
aluminium armor and weapons systems are produced by 7,000 skilled
workers in 586 businesses across 44 states.

Now, in an attempt to modernize the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and
lasting at least three years. [With production halted]{.underline}, the
businesses that make up the Bradley Industrial Base will be unable to
employ the highly skilled workers who produce the specialized parts that
keep these vehicles running. [Thousands of workers will lose their jobs,
and some will move on to other fields, while their skills - unique to
building combat vehicles - will become lost or obsolete. As a result,
our armed forces may end up going into harm\'s way without equipment
manufactured in America and ready for today\'s battlefield]{.underline}.

[Since World War II, our military - and all Americans - have relied on a
highly skilled, dedicated and engaged civilian defense labor force of
engineers, designers, welders, electricians, machinists and pipe
fitters]{.underline}. Like a well-prepared combat team, [this labor
force]{.underline} - nearly 625,000 people - [is continuously training
in order to maintain their technological superiority. As new
technologies are developed to address the ever-changing threats from our
enemy, this labor force acquires new skills to keep pace and meet the
military\'s needs]{.underline}.

[Now these workers]{.underline}, the products they make, the incomes
their families and communities depend on [and America\'s ability to
defend itself are all at risk]{.underline}.

As a nation, [we must make it a priority to ensure the strength of the
Army\'s combat vehicle program and the skilled defense industrial base
jobs that support this crucial capability. The Army can
help]{.underline} the Bradley Industrial Base [in the near term simply
by spending the \$288 million provided last year to allow industry to
perform its requirements, which ensure that older vehicles are
upgraded]{.underline} with the latest technology our troops need.

[In the longer term, the Army should work with industry to ensure that
our troops can meet the missions they might face, while providing
industry with the stability to sustain the skilled jobs needed to
respond to future]{.underline}.

**[Dwindling [budgets and]{.mark} the desire [for short-term financial
gains are threatening America\'s \"arsenal of democracy\"]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} with it our [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The skilled
men and women of the defense manufacturing industry do work that allows
us to fly the red, white and blue, and they must not be pink-slipped.
[[Equipping our military is]{.mark} [too important to
outsource]{.mark} - our economy, our national security and our fellow
Americans count on it]{.underline}.

### \*Rare Earths Turn

#### Trade war over Taiwan means China is starting to restrict access to rare earth minerals

**[Li 19]{.underline}** Yun Li, 5-30-2019, \"Why China\'s threat to
restrict rare earth minerals is so serious,\" MSN,
<https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/why-chinas-threat-to-restrict-rare-earth-minerals-is-so-serious/ar-AAC9sdJ>
Lowell-SB

**[[China\'s threat to curb exports of rare earth minerals to the United
States]{.mark} could [move the needle in an escalating trade war]{.mark}
as the world\'s two largest economies continue to jockey for
leverage.]{.underline}** The official newspaper of the Communist Party
of China explicitly warned the U.S. on Wednesday [that [China would cut
off rare earth minerals as a countermeasure]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the
escalated trade battle. Rare earth minerals are a suite of 17 elements
mineable in the earth\'s crust, with names such as cerium, europium and
lutetium. They are commonly used in everything from car motors and
electronics to oil refining and clean diesel to many major weapons
systems the U.S. relies on for national security, including lasers and
radar.]{.underline} About 35% of rare earth global reserves are in
China, the most in the world, and the country is a mining machine,
producing 120,000 metric tons or 70% of total rare earths in 2018,
according to the United States Geological Survey. [The U.S. pales in
comparison as it mined 15,000 metric tons of rare earths in 2018 and has
a total of 1.4 million metric tons of reserves, versus China\'s 44
million.]{.underline} [U.S. consumption of rare earth compounds and
metals relies heavily on imports, which rose to \$160 million in 2018,
according to USGS. Eighty percent were from China]{.underline}. To make
it worse, although other countries supply to the U.S. including Estonia
(6%), France (3%) and Japan (3%), much of their materials were derived
from mineral concentrates and chemical substances produced in China,
according to Hui Shan, commodities analyst at Goldman Sachs. \"The
U.S.\' reliance on Chinese supply may be higher than the import
breakdown data suggest on the surface,\" Shan said in a note on
[Wednesday. **[Given U.S. dependence on Chinese supply, the threat of a
restriction could hurt many industries including]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[high-tech devices, automotives, clean energy, and [defense]{.mark}.
An example is the element lanthanum.]{.underline}** \"The glass industry
is the largest consumer of rare earths. For example, lanthanum makes up
as much as 50% of digital camera lenses, including cell phone cameras.
Hybrid electric cars use significant amounts of lanthanum in its
batteries -- 10-15 kilograms per vehicle,\" said Michael Widmer, metals
strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a note. Dangerous
interaction **[Rare earth materials are also [crucial to the U.S.
defense systems]{.mark} because of their usage in lasers, radar, sonar,
night vision systems, missile guidance, jet engines, and even alloys for
armored vehicles, all of which the U.S. relies upon for national
security.]{.underline}** The Pentagon on Wednesday presented a report to
Congress on rare earth minerals in an effort to reduce reliance on
China. The move came after the Chinese newspaper People\'s Daily warned
it would cut off the rare earth supply, saying \"don\'t say we didn\'t
warn you.\" In a 2018 report by the Department of Defense, China\'s
domination of rare earth elements was highlighted as it shows \"the
potentially dangerous interaction between Chinese economic aggression
guided by its strategic industrial policies and vulnerabilities and gaps
in America\'s manufacturing and defense industrial base.\" **[\"[China
has strategically flooded the global market]{.mark} with rare earths at
subsidized prices, driven out competitors, and deterred new market
entrants,\" the report said.]{.underline}** Non-Chinese suppliers While
China remains a dominant player in the rare earth market, production
outside of the country is also growing, which could provide the U.S.
with some alternatives, according to Credit Suisse. Non-Chinese
production has grown to about 29% of the global production from just 3%
in 2009, said Manish Nigam, Credit Suisse\'s equity analyst said in a
note on Thursday. \"A U.S. facility is under a revival plan since last
year, and the fully operational Australian/ Malaysian venture (Lynas)
has a production capacity that is more than the entire demand of the
U.S., though processing of some oxides still gets done in China,\" Nigam
said. The impact of an export ban would be somewhat diffused across
different U.S. sectors and countries, Nigam said, noting that electric
vehicles and clean energy would be impacted the most. Nonetheless, any
escalation at this point poses a threat to the market as stocks continue
to suffer amid the tit-for-tat strategies in the trade war. The S&P 500
is down 5.4% in May, on track to post its first negative month of the
year. \"[The effect of China restricting its rare earth exports to the
US could have a much larger impact on the broader market this time
around because of the ongoing US-China trade war]{.underline},\" said
Goldman\'s Shan. \"Investors probably would expect further retaliations
from the US and risk assets such as copper could face even more
headwinds than it is currently under.\"

As the possibility of a full-blown trade war with China looms over the
economy, **[it's [important to understand the pressure points that
Beijing could push to exert leverage against the U.S.]{.mark} And the
nation's Achilles' heel could very well be a complete dependence on
China for a growing number of key minerals and metals.]{.underline}** If
tit-for-tat tariffs don't result in detente[, **[Beijing could cripple
America's industrial supply chain by placing an embargo on minerals and
metals exports,]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**particularly rare earth
minerals. It's Beijing's ace up the sleeve, and we gave it to them.**
Despite an abundance of minerals reserves, America has become
increasingly dependent on imports to meet demand. The U.S. Geological
Survey reports that America is now 100 percent import-reliant for 21
minerals, and at least 50 percent import-reliant for another 29. Most
troubling is that the U.S. is now 100 percent import-dependent for all
of the 17 minerals that constitute the rare-earth minerals group. **And
[China]{.mark}, which [controls more than 95 percent of global
rare-earth minerals production, has a monopoly.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Whether it's cellphones, electric motors, batteries, aircraft, wind
turbines or MRI machines, rare **[earths play an essential role. But
it's not just commercial manufacturing assembly lines that are
vulnerable to an embargo; it's also military hardware. Whether it's the
advanced electronics and control systems in F-22 and F-35 aircraft,
night vision devices, guidance, targeting systems, or dozens of other
critical defense technologies, they're all built with rare earth
components. While the U.S. has a small strategic reserve of some of
these minerals --- to provide a short-term supply for our military
supply chain --- we have allowed ourselves to become unnervingly
comfortable in China's vise.]{.underline}**

A report by **[the [U.S. Commerce Department recommends the government

critical to military development]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The report was
released Tuesday amid a trade war between the United States and China.
["The United States is heavily dependent on critical mineral imports. If
China or Russia were to stop exports to the United States and its allies
for a prolonged period --- similar to China's rare earths embargo in
2010 --- an extended supply disruption could cause significant shocks
throughout U.S. and foreign critical mineral supply chains," the report
states.]{.underline} The report also notes that the U.S. is
import-reliant on 31 of the 35 minerals designated as critical by the
Department of the Interior. Furthermore, the U.S. completely relies on
imports for 14 of these minerals. The report also says the country's
imports of "critical mineral commodities" exceed 50 percent of its
annual consumption. These rare earth minerals are often used in the
production of aircraft, computers and GPS systems. Last year China
produced 78 percent of the world's rare earth minerals, according to
researchers at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ["These [critical minerals
are]{.mark} often [overlooked]{.mark}]{.underline}

Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a news release. "Through the

**[[The U.S. arms sale plan]{.underline}]{.mark}** unveiled Monday
**[[is a dangerous move that will only aggravate the]{.mark} already

Strait]{.underline}**.

**[The U.S. government has approved a]{.underline}** possible
**[500-million-U.S. dollar military sale to Taiwan]{.underline}**,
claiming that the move will help to improve the security and defensive
capability of the recipient.

Subsequently, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen expressed \"gratitude,\" saying
that the arms sale was \"timely.\"

**[[The situation]{.mark} across the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}**, which
is already complicated and grim, **[[is worsening as the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has been using Taiwan to contain
China]{.mark}]{.underline}** while the Taiwan administration kept
seeking foreign intervention.

The **[Taiwan]{.underline}** question **[concerns China\'s sovereignty

**[norms]{.underline}** governing international relations, **[the
one-China principle and the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and
undermine China\'s sovereignty and security interests.]{.underline}**

**[China\'s firm opposition to such arms sales is consistent and
firm.]{.underline}**

Since **[the]{.underline}** current **[U.S.]{.underline}**
administration took office, it **[has constantly played the \"Taiwan
card\" to contain China]{.underline}**, especially in arms sales to
Taiwan and military exchanges between the United States and Taiwan.

**[This has seriously damaged China-U.S. relations and jeopardized peace
and stability across the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}**

The Taiwan question, which concerns China\'s core interests and the
national bond of the Chinese people, brooks no external interference.

**[The U.S.]{.underline}** administration **[has]{.underline}** once
again **[stirred up sensitive nerves]{.underline}** in the Taiwan
Strait. **[Its gross interference]{.underline}** in China\'s internal
affairs **[has aroused the strong indignation of the Chinese
people]{.underline}** on both sides of the Strait.

**[Some Taiwan organizations and people protested outside the American
Institute in Taiwan]{.underline}** (AIT) in Taipei, condemning U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan and demanding \"no war, only peace,\" and \"**[Taiwan is
not a pawn for the United States]{.underline}**.\"

Therefore, **[[we would]{.underline}]{.mark}** like to **[[advise the
U.S. side to clearly recognize the high sensitivity and serious harm of
arms sales to Taiwan]{.mark}, correct mistakes, honor its commitments
and handle Taiwan-related issues in a prudent and proper manner in
accordance with the one-China principle]{.underline}** and the
provisions of the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques.

Taiwan\'s current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration,
which is teetering on the brink of collapse, was overjoyed at the U.S.
arms sales as if it had been given a \"straw to save its life.\"

Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP administration have escalated provocations
against the Chinese mainland, created disturbances recently and
cooperated with the United States in vigorously clamoring the so-called
\"military threat\" from the mainland.

In the face of next year\'s general election on the island, Tsai and the
DPP will not hesitate to let Taiwan serve as a pawn for forces of
external interference in order to protect their power, regardless of the
safety and well-being of the Taiwanese people.

This party has not only misjudged the situation but also deviated from
the people\'s heart.

**[[U.S. weapons cannot guarantee Taiwan\'s security]{.mark}.
Tsai]{.underline}** and the DPP **[cannot secure]{.underline}** their
**[power]{.underline}** and position **[by seeking foreign interference
or threatening the people]{.underline}**.

**[Tsai, the DPP and \"Taiwan independence\" separatist elements should
not play with fire]{.underline}** or even think about it. They are
doomed to be alone in the face of the pressure of their own actions.

On April 17, 124 years ago, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed,
securing foreigner\'s occupation of Taiwan for half a century. It left
lasting, painful memories for all Chinese.

Today\'s **[China will never allow the historical tragedy of national
division to repeat itself]{.underline}**.

**[No one and no force should underestimate the determination and
capability of the Chinese in safeguarding national sovereignty and

On the U.S. side, **[for an arguably growing number of American and some
foreign observers, Beijing's de facto challenge to American
predominance]{.underline}** in the Western Pacific **[is a mere prelude
to a larger effort to eject the United States from Asia and eventually
replace it as the regional]{.underline}** (and for some, global)
**[superpower]{.underline}**. Chinese support for a multipolar,
balance-of-power system is thus seen as a mere tactical feint designed
to undermine U.S. power while Beijing prepares to become the new
hegemon. Indeed, **[for such observers, [Beijing's greater
assertiveness]{.mark} regarding maritime territorial
disputes]{.underline}** as well as U.S. and Japanese intelligence and
surveillance activities along its coastline **[[constitute strategic
gambits designed to "test" U.S. and allied resolve]{.mark} and
ultimately to create "no-go" zones essential for the establishment of
Chinese control over the Western Pacific. Such an outcome would directly
threaten both U.S. and allied interests]{.underline}** in an open,
secure, and peaceful Asia-Pacific region. **[Given this supposedly
unambiguous threat, for these observers, the only logical course of
action for the United States is to decisively disabuse Beijing of its
aspirations by enhancing American predominance and thereby increasing,
rather than reducing, Chinese vulnerability in the Western
Pacific.]{.underline}**

**[This view]{.underline}** is held not only by scholars and policy
analysts outside Washington. It is also fairly common among U.S.
government officials, both civilian and military. It **[offers a
black-and-white, Manichean-type solution to a supposedly clear-cut
threat, and one that is extremely appealing to those many U.S.
policymakers and analysts convinced of the huge merits (and necessity)
of continued American predominance]{.underline}** in maritime Asia. In
fact, even for those who reject the notion that Beijing is working to
dislodge the United States from the region, predominance remains the
best insurance against an uncertain future, for the reasons outlined
above. While the type of U.S. predominance in Asia espoused by most U.S.
observers can vary somewhat, depending in part on how one views China's
capabilities and intentions, **[the bottom line for virtually all such
individuals is the need for a clear U.S. ability to prevail in any
important military-political contingency involving China]{.underline}**.
Moreover, **[this view is reinforced, in their minds, by the notion that
America's allies and friends also supposedly desire and require
continued U.S. maritime predominance.]{.underline}**

**[The problem with [this outlook is]{.mark} that it is [based on an
inaccurate,]{.mark} increasingly [unrealistic]{.mark}, and
[dangerous]{.mark} [assessme]{.mark}nt of both the threat the United
States confronts in Asia and the likely consequences of the remedy
proposed. [Beijing's]{.mark} de facto attempts to limit or end U.S.
predominance along its maritime periphery are
[motivated]{.mark}]{.underline}** almost entirely **[[by uncertainties,
fears, insecurities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and a certain level of
opportunism, [**[not a grand strategic vision of Chinese
predominance]{.underline}**,]{.mark} despite the arguably growing
expression of ultranationalist views within China. **[Those who view
China as an aspiring hegemon seeking America's
subordination]{.underline}** and ultimate ejection from Asia almost
without exception **[base their argument on shaky theoretical postulates
and faulty historical analogies or on the decidedly non-authoritative
views of a few Chinese analysts, not current, hard evidence regarding
either Chinese strategies and doctrines or Chinese behavior, past and
present]{.underline}**.

**[Such observers argue]{.underline}** that **[all rising powers
seek]{.underline}** hard-power **[dominance]{.underline}** in an
anarchic interstate system and that China is a power that always sought
to dominate its world. **[However, such absolutist beliefs run counter
to the very mixed record of power grabbing and power balancing,
aggression and restraint, deterrence and reassurance that has
characterized great power relations historically. They]{.underline}**
also **[ignore the fact that, in the premodern era, Chinese predominance
within its part of Asia most often consisted of pragmatic and mutually
beneficial exchanges]{.underline}** of ritualistic deference for
material gains, **[not Chinese hard-power control. While implying a
preference for symbolically hierarchical relationships with smaller
neighbors, China's premodern approach did not amount to a demand
for]{.underline}** clear-cut **[dominance and
subordination]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[the advent of
modern]{.underline}**, independent, and in most cases strong
**[nation-states along China's borders; the forces of economic
globalization; and the existence of nuclear weapons have enormously
reduced, if not eliminated, both the willingness and the ability of
Chinese leaders today to dominate Asia and carve out an exclusionary
sphere of influence, especially in hard-power terms]{.underline}**. By
necessity, **[their objective is to reduce their considerable
vulnerability]{.underline}** and increase their political, diplomatic,
and economic leverage in their own backyard to a level where Chinese
interests must be reflected in those major political, economic, and
security actions undertaken by neighboring states. **[This is a much
less ambitious and in many ways understandable goal for a continental
great power. And it does not necessarily threaten vital U.S. or allied
interests]{.underline}**.

**[[Not all A2AD systems are as technically mature]{.mark} and
operationally effective as they are made out to be.]{.underline}**

[The Swedish report points out that Russia's S-400 surface-to-air
missile system (also in service in China) has yet to actually receive
its vaunted 250-mile range 40N6 missiles]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[very long-range interceptions are only viable against large, slow
aircraft (think tankers, cargo planes and AWACS radar planes) flying at
high altitude. 'Pushing back' vital support planes is still useful, but
agile war planes may only become vulnerable within a few dozen miles of
a SAM site.]{.underline}

[Another intimidating new technology, anti-ship ballistic missiles, has
only been tested against naval targets a few times, and never in
combat]{.underline}

On the other hand, cruise missiles and short-range land-attack ballistic
missiles have seen extensive combat employment in the last half-century,
blasting Middle Eastern cities and sinking Royal Navy ships in the
Falklands. Land-based missile transporters have proven easy to conceal
and difficult to hunt down.

[The FOI study also points out that short-range air defense systems like
the Pantsir-S have repeatedly failed to stop U.S. cruise missile
barrages and constant Israeli air strikes.]{.underline}

**[[A2AD systems can't see as far as they can
shoot]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

A 40N6 missile (when and if it enters service) may threaten aircraft up
to 250 miles away. A DF-21D may be able to sink a carrier a thousand
mile away.

**[However, [neither missile batteries' organic fire control radars can
realistically acquire targets]{.mark} that far over the horizon due to
the curvature of the Earth. Both would need to cue targeting data by
networking with remote AWACS radar and maritime patrol planes, drones,
surveillance satellites, and distant land and sea-based
radars.]{.underline}**

Forming such a 'kill-chain' is doable---but it's technically challenging
task that requires practice and is vulnerable to disruption at any point
in the chain. For instance, the surveillance and communication assets
could be destroyed, or their communication links to firing platforms
jammed.

Both China and Russia, however, are assembling the surveillance
capabilities to form kill chain, however, by expanding its satellite
surveillance assets and deploying new airborne radar planes.

'Threatening' an area doesn't have to mean 'denying' it.

[In recent conflicts, U.S. air and naval forces have benefited from
technological 'offsets' allowing them to bombard adversaries from afar
at virtually no risk to return fire.]{.underline} For example, the U.S.
did not lose a single warplane to enemy fire in its 2011 intervention
against Libya.

However, when combating a peer adversary, Western forces may simply have
to accept higher degrees of risk in order to complete their missions. In
other words, A2/AD systems may take out some ships or aircraft, but not
necessarily impose high enough costs to defeat operations in a region
before they are neutralized.

For example, during World War II land-based bombers posed a deadly
anti-access threat to warships that passed within their range. However,
that didn't prevent Allied naval forces from taking what lumps they had
to when evacuating troops at Dunkirk and Crete, or conducting amphibious
landings in Dieppe, Sicily and Normandy.

Counter-measures against A2AD strategy and technologies already exist.

The Rand analysts argue the U.S. military could address its weaknesses
versus anti-access weapons by re-allocating roughly \$24 billion of its
roughly \$700 billion annual budget to existing systems. In their view,
sacrificing funding for, say, one or two carriers, makes sense if it
pays for capabilities that make the remaining nine floating airbases
much more survivable.

[Basically, the analysts think the U.S. needs a larger supply
surface-strike missiles to threaten enemies at long range; and a much
larger capacity to defend against incoming long-range missiles with
counter-missiles.]{.underline}

In other words, fight fire with fire and water.

Naturally, greater numbers of long-range, high-capacity launch platforms
are desirable.

On the offense side, promising new long-range strike weapons include the
LRASM anti-ship missile, the stealthy JASSM-ER cruise missile and the
Army's multi-faceted Long-Range Precision Fire program. On the defense
side, the Army's maneuver short-range air defense program and the Navy's
SM-3 and SM-6 offer promising force protection capabilities.

Taking the analysts' conclusion together, one can arrive at a more
nuanced understanding of the challenges posed by anti-access
weapons[.]{.underline} Undeniably[,]{.underline} A2/AD weapons can
threaten large areas and will likely shape operations in the regions
where they are present. **[However, they cannot "shut down" access to a
region by themselves, and [their threat can be mitigated through
appropriate planning using existing technologies and
tactics.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Increase Arms CP

#### Any inclusion of high-tech weapons assures conflict -- breaks Chinese red-lines

Are the US and China About to Face off Over American Fighter Sales to
Taiwan? If the Trump administration approves a recent request, it could
set up a major crisis. March 25, 2019
https://thediplomat.com/2019/03/are-the-us-and-china-about-to-face-off-over-american-fighter-sales-to-taiwan/

**[The [United States and China appear to be heading toward a major
confrontation over]{.mark} the]{.underline}** possible [**[sale of
American fighters to Taiwan]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Last week, Taiwanese President **[Tsai Ing-wen confirmed that the
country's Ministry of Defense had submitted a]{.underline}** formal
**[request to]{.underline}** Washington, D.C., to **[purchase F-16V
Viper fighters]{.underline}**. Tsai said the decision to make the
request was supported by a review of Taiwan's defense needs.

Days later, **[Bloomberg News reported that the White House was poised
to approve the]{.underline}** Taiwanese **[request]{.underline}**.

**[If]{.underline}** that report is **[true, the United States would be
turning course]{.underline}** on what has been a longstanding reluctance
to sell fighters to Taiwan, even as it has authorized other arms sales
in line with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which requires the U.S.
government to support Taiwan "with arms of a defensive character."

Even as the Obama administration and the Trump administration have
approved weapons and spare parts for sale to Taiwan, [**[fighters have
long been seen as a bridge too far given Beijing serious
reservations]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

The United States authorized the sale of 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan in
1992. The Obama administration, after receiving a request from Taipei,
turned it down, initiating a set of upgrades instead to Taipei's
existing fleet.

The issue hasn't gone unnoticed in China, where Taiwan is seen as an
inherent part of the country. Relations across the Taiwan Strait have
been particularly strained since Tsai's inauguration in 2016.

The Taiwanese president hails from the independence-leaning Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), though she herself has not explicitly supported
independence --- long a red-line for Beijing --- Tsai, however, has
refused to endorse the so-called "1992 consensus," which her predecessor
had supported and which forms what Beijing sees as the baseline for
cordial cross-strait relations.

"**[[China's position to firmly oppose arms sales to Taiwan is
consistent and clear]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Geng Shuang said during a press briefing on Friday.

"**[We have made stern representations to the U.S. We have urged the
U.S. to fully recognize the sensitivity of this issue and the harm it
will cause]{.underline}**."

The prospect of **[a fighter sale to Taiwan]{.underline}** this time
**[comes at a time of]{.underline}** particularly **[heightened
U.S.-China tensions]{.underline}**. The Trump administration has been
known to seek leverage with Beijing across issues and it is possible
that this may turn into the latest case of Taiwan being used a possible
bargaining chip as Trump seeks to clinch a favorable trade deal with
Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump, however, has been unconventional on Taiwan policy in the past. As
president-elect, he broke expectations by receiving a telephone call
from Tsai. That call occurred at a time when Trump had yet to endorse
the United States' one-China policy as president --- something that he
did for the first time in February 2017.

Either way, **[Tsai's fighter request and the Trump administration's
reported acceptance could set up another major area of turbulence
between the United States and China.]{.underline}**

#### Solves none of the aff -- increases Chinese aggression

**[Hua 15]{.underline}** Zhang Hua, assistant research fellow at the
Institute of Taiwan Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Global
Times Arms sales to Taiwan do not help the US
http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/959549.shtml

**[Washington]{.underline}** formally **[[announced a \$1.83 billion
arms sale package to Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Wednesday.
**[[China slammed the sale for interfering in its internal
affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}** and vowed to impose sanctions on relevant
American companies. **[Chinese pundits see this as new proof of
Washington\'s desire to contain China]{.underline}** by roiling
cross-Straits relations. In fact, **[arms sales to Taiwan have already
had a negative impact on the US]{.underline}**.

**[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}** has to accept it **[[is becoming
far less capable of containing China\'s rise. It may upset the
government of the Chinese mainland by making a fuss with Taiwan, but it
won\'t have a real effect.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Washington\'s primary intent in forging a military relationship with
Taiwan is to maintain military balance across the Taiwan Strait.
However, the strategy is stretched too thin. Given the mainland\'s swift
and prominent ramp-up in military spending, **[a military balance can no
longer be stricken between the mainland and Taiwan, [no matter how many
advanced weapons the US sells to Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[The possibility of using Taiwan to suppress the
mainland\'s]{.underline}** growing **[leverage]{.underline}** in its
periphery **[is vanishing. The mainland\'s economic aggregate is more
than 20 times larger than Taiwan\'s, so the latter has no chance to
engage in a military race with the former.]{.underline}**

Selling arms to Taiwan doesn\'t mean Washington would hold on to its
promise to \"come and rescue\" Taiwan when the island is in trouble with
the mainland. It is not even a commitment to include Taiwan in its
umbrella of protection. Even some Taiwanese strategists have pointed out
that Taiwan is too obsessed with the delusion that Washington will come
all the way to defend Taiwan.

Washington also cunningly argues that the weaponry deal will bolster
Taiwan\'s confidence when it needs to negotiate with the mainland in
other respects. In fact, in such talks, it is always the mainland that
makes more room for Taiwan\'s wellbeing, not because Taiwan has a strong
military capability that is feared by the mainland, but because the
mainland regards Taiwan as family.

Although the US, especially its arms enterprises and political brokers,
could reap fat profits from such practices, these companies and
individuals might risk losing the second biggest market. The pros and
cons are not hard to weigh. In fact, some companies have started to
reflect on the deal.

Washington seems to have gone on the offensive in the arms deal, but
Beijing can find opportunities to strike back. From the Diaoyu Islands
to the South China Sea disputes, the US keeps stirring troubles against
China in recent years during the implementation of its \"rebalancing to
Asia\" strategy. China could have resorted to countermeasures but is too
prudent to take real action. On the occasion of this arms deal, for
which the US has neither moral nor legal ground, Beijing should take the
chance to carry out down-to-earth countermeasures, such as halting
bilateral communications over military matters and sanctioning relevant
US enterprises.

It becomes increasingly obvious that **[[playing the Taiwan card is no
longer an effective approach to countering China\'s
rise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On the contrary, **[it makes Washington
take bigger risks to jeopardize a relationship with the Chinese
mainland, which is clearly more important.]{.underline}**

### Leverage CP

#### China would say no AND it doesn't solve -- bargaining over Taiwan makes the CP look like bad faith -- they prefer unilateral concessions

Issue 4 \| Spring 2016

Even if one were to set aside all of the above concerns, history shows
that **[[Glaser\'s proposal is infeasible]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
because **[[Chinese leaders do not see the abrogation of the U.S.
commitment to Taiwan as an issue]{.mark} [over which they must bargain
and offer concessions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, President
Richard **[Nixon attempted a similar grand bargain]{.underline}** while
negotiating the opening of Sino-U.S. relations from 1971 to 1972. At the
time, one of the Nixon administration\'s greatest concerns was ending
the Vietnam War. Beijing\'s greatest priority was obtaining U.S.
recognition of Taiwan as a part of the People\'s Republic of China (PRC)
and securing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the island.2
Understanding Beijing\'s desires, President Nixon and Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger strategized that they would offer to remove U.S. troops
in exchange for China\'s help in achieving peace with honor in Vietnam.
Nixon\'s handwritten notes for his historic trip to China demonstrate
the bargain he wanted to strike:

> Taiwan = Vietnam = trade off
>
> 1\. Your people expect action on Taiwan
>
> 2\. Our people expect action on VN
>
> Neither can act immediately---But both are inevitable---let us not
> embarrass each other.3

In preparation for Nixon\'s official visit, Kissinger made a secret trip
to Beijing in July 1971 and proposed the bargain to the Chinese
leadership. In a meeting with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, Kissinger
stated that because two-thirds of the U.S. forces in Taiwan were related
to American efforts in the Indochina theater, the withdrawal of those
troops would depend on the resolution of the Vietnam War.4 He reasoned
that although the United States was sincere in wanting to end the war,
several issues---ranging from war reparations to the North Vietnamese
government\'s refusal to talk with the South Vietnamese
government---stood in the way of an "honorable" exit.5 Kissinger implied
that China\'s help in pressuring its North Vietnamese ally to accept the
administration\'s peace terms would speed the exit of U.S. troops from
Taiwan. **[Chinese leaders]{.underline}**, however, **[refused to strike
such a bargain. In their eyes, Taiwan was a rightful part of the PRC and
they did not owe the United States anything in exchange for a withdrawal
of U.S. forces from territory they considered theirs.
Zhou]{.underline}**, for example, **[told Kissinger]{.underline}**
during their July 1971 meeting **[that [attempting to attach conditions
to the recognition of China\'s sovereignty over Taiwan]{.mark} was [as
absurd as China questioning U.S. sovereignty over Hawaii or Long
Island]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He emphasized that **[the United States
should "unreservedly"]{.underline}** recognize the PRC\'s sovereignty
and **[withdraw]{.underline}** all U.S. **[troops]{.underline}**, as
this was "the natural logic of the matter."6 Again when Nixon suggested
during his trip to Beijing in February 1972 that ending the war in
Vietnam would "help the direction on Taiwan,"7 Zhou replied subtly that
China was willing to "wait a little while," and that because Taiwan was
China\'s "internal affair," Beijing could not "place too much hope on
the U.S. and Mr. President to achieve this."8 Moreover, China continued
to fund North Vietnam\'s war efforts in the name of aiding nationalist
revolutions abroad. Instead of pressuring its ally, Beijing sent
unprecedented amounts of military assistance to North Vietnam between
1971 and 1973.9 China today is much more confidant and ambitious than
the China Nixon visited in 1972. **[There is little reason to believe
that Beijing would entertain a bargain similar to the one it rejected
decades ago.]{.underline}**

**[The "grand bargain" idea probably resonates less with Beijing than
Washington. From Beijing's point of view, this would [be asking it to

would be operationalized is unclear. What would it mean for China to
"officially accept" U.S. alliances and military bases]{.underline}** in
the Asia-Pacific? This would seem to require Beijing to renounce its
proudly "principled" opposition to any country having "Cold War era"
alliances and foreign bases. At the same time, **[[it is easy to foresee

#### Permutation do the plan and establish a grand bargain with China -- the initial concession makes it more likely that China will say yes to further exchanges

Choice between Military Competition and Accommodation Posted Online May

Another way to balance feasibility and benefits, therefore, could be to
look for a path that divides the grand bargain into smaller, more
attainable increments. One can imagine a series of steps, including the
United States ending its arms sales to Taiwan and China ending its use
of force to advance its maritime claims, that could be implemented
sequentially to create a phased grand bargain. This approach would
enable the United States to revert to its current Taiwan policy if China
failed to uphold its side of the phased agreement. Another possibility
might include partial resolution of the maritime disputes. An agreement
that delayed resolution of the sovereignty disputes far into the future,
or indefinitely, while settling the resource disputes would be more
feasible to achieve than a full resolution. This type of agreement could
be possible because, for the most part, the sovereignty disputes can be
separated from the resource disputes. In fact, China and Japan reached
this type of arrangement in 2008, although it has yet to be
implemented.111 **[[The United States could pursue a]{.mark} variant of
[this staged approach that would enable it to]{.mark} try to [push the
diplomatic process forward]{.mark}. In this more proactive model, [the
United States would make its initial concession unilaterally]{.mark},

### Maritime CP

#### **[Relations -- offensive arms sales are a lynchpin issue -]{.underline}** Taiwan is inherently problematic -- their CP is inadequate

**[Kim and Easley]{.underline}** prefer the United States\' current
policy to a grand bargain. Both **[recommend some modifications designed
to reassure and engage China, including joint participation in
humanitarian missions, naval cooperation on counter-piracy operations,
deepening of economic interdependence via the U.S.-China bilateral
investment treaty, and support of initiatives that would increase
China\'s role in international organizations]{.underline}**. As I argue
in my article, there is much to like about the current U.S. policy
toward China and East Asia more broadly. If the United States adheres to
this policy, then many of these recommendations would be useful
refinements.

**[Nevertheless, proponents]{.underline}** of the United States\'
current China policy tend to **[[underestimate the risks inherent in the
U.S. commitment to Taiwan, including its role in fueling military
competition and supporting Chinese elites\' negative views of U.S.
motives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Neither Kim nor Easley says much about
these risks, and certain of their remarks suggest they are not small.
Kim holds that China is "much more confidant and ambitious" than when
President Nixon visited China in 1972 and that "Chinese leaders today
believe that the United States is determined to contain and divide China
internally." Easley expresses similar concerns, stating that
"\[f\]oreign policy ambition in Beijing has outgrown the 1950s and 1990s
cross-strait crises; \[that\] Chinese internal debates tend to paint the
United States as a global competitor," and that China "is pursuing a
Chinese-centered regional architecture." Given these views of China,
**[Kim\'s and Easley\'s recommendations, though useful, are [likely
inadequate to meet the challenges currently facing the United
States]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This does not mean that such a modified
U.S. policy would necessarily be inferior to the grand bargain I have
recommended, given that all options for dealing with China\'s rise will
involve costs or risks, or both. **[The [advantage of my proposed grand
bargain, however, is that it confronts the challenge posed by China\'s
rise head on]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It offers a path for eliminating
the most serious geopolitical disagreement between the United States and
China and for moderating the concomitant political strains and military
competition, while providing valuable information about the limited
nature of China\'s goals that, in turn, reduces the risks of
accommodation. And, **[[in combination with policies that reaffirm and
deepen the commitment of the United States to its East Asian allies, it
would enable the United States to protect its key interests in the
region]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Notwithstanding the points raised by Kim
and Easely, the grand bargain remains the best bet available to the
United States.

Practical Issues

**[There are]{.underline}** other **[[conceptual and practical obstacles
to maritime security cooperation]{.mark} in the South China
Sea.]{.underline}**

**[[Lack of trust]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- **[Many Asian nations
harbor deep-seated, historically based suspicions of each other, making
security cooperation all the more difficult]{.underline}**. As Lord
Palmerstone and Henry Kissinger believed and practiced "there are no
permanent friends or enemies -- only permanent interests." Most
countries' decisions are influenced to some degree by the thinking
behind this dictum, particularly in Asia. **[Some view maritime security
cooperation as advantaging the more powerful, who can display the
superiority of their technology, assets, and weapons and thus tacitly
intimidate their potential opponents while observing and detecting the
their weaknesses. The same reticence applies to information sharing.
This mind-set makes maritime security cooperation all the more
difficult.]{.underline}**

**[[Differences in scale]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- **[The scales of
territory, population, military capacity, and economy among South China
Sea countries are quite asymmetric. Many have limited resources and
capabilities, and do not want to commit scarce resources to cooperation
to meet threats that are low priority]{.underline}** to them. These
might include trade in WMDs, noncommercial freedom of navigation
concerns, and maritime domain awareness, all of which are in the greater
interest of outside maritime powers.

**[[Competition between China and the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** ---
**[Both China and the United States]{.underline}**
(**[and]{.underline}** its allies **[Japan, Australia, and the
U.K]{.underline}**.) **[are offering cooperative maritime security
exercises and assistance to the Southeast Asian claimants. Maritime
security cooperation with one side is often seen as taking a stand
against the other. This pressure to "choose sides" is reinforced by
China and the United States themselves]{.underline}** --- sometimes
publicly but more often behind the scenes. Most Southeast Asian coastal
nations welcome assistance in capacity building. But they may well be
more reticent to sign on to any regional scheme that could be taken as
"siding" with one side against the other --- or as endorsing a security
role for external military forces.

**[[Practical obstacles]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- **[Practical
obstacles to maritime security cooperation]{.underline}** by Southeast
Asian littoral countries **[include tight operating budgets; lack of
common doctrine, language, and interoperability of equipment; and widely
varying stages of technological development. Intelligence information
sharing is particularly sensitive because it involves potentially
indirectly revealing sources and methods]{.underline}** as well.

significant obstacle]{.underline}]{.mark}** to undertaking a transition
toward a stable balance of power in Asia **[[derives from the
insecurities and weaknesses]{.mark} of the Chinese government, both
domestically and abroad. China's leaders]{.underline}** rely, for their
legitimacy and support, not only on continued economic success and
rising living standards, but also **[on]{.underline}** a form of
**[nationalism that prizes the ability of the regime to correct past
injustices]{.underline}** meted out by "imperialist" powers during
China's so-called "century of humiliation" and to stand up to current
slights, both real and imagined. Thus, their policies often capitalize
on the resentments felt by many Chinese citizens toward the supposedly
arrogant West and Japan. **[[This viewpoint makes the Chinese
leadershi]{.mark}p]{.underline}** hesitant to quell the more extreme
forms of nationalism described above and **[[deeply suspicious of the
United States and its allies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It also makes it
more receptive to the notion that a rising yet still underdeveloped and
relatively weak China must continue to conceal its military capabilities
while developing its overall capacities to the maximum extent possible.
In other words, **[the Chinese regime is both excessively vulnerable to
ultranationalist pressures and disinclined to contemplate self-imposed
limitations on its sovereign rights]{.underline}** (for example, with
regard to Taiwan) and its political, economic, and military abilities,
especially in Asia. While this does not translate into a drive for
predominance, **[it does make Beijing less willing to accept the kind of
mutual restraints]{.underline}** necessary to achieve a stable balance
of power in the Western Pacific. No grand bargain, but a clear
understanding and a staged process are required **[These obstacles
clearly indicate that Washington and [Beijing are not about to
undertake, much less reach, a formal grand-bargain-type of agreement to
establish a new regional security environment anytime
soon]{.mark}]{.underline}**.4 **[Such a fundamental shift]{.underline}**
in policies and approaches **[can only occur gradually, in stages, and
over an extended period of time]{.underline}**. But it can only begin if
elites in Washington, Beijing, and other Asian capitals seriously
examine the enduring trends under way in Asia and accept the reality of
the changing power distribution and the need for more than just marginal
adjustments and assurances. Only then will they undertake a systematic
examination of the requirements of a stable balance of power over the
long term, involving a serious consideration of the more fundamental
actions. Such an examination and acceptance must initially occur
domestically, then among allies and protectorates, and finally via a
bilateral U.S.-China strategic dialogue aimed at developing
understandings about the process and actions required. Such
understandings must provide for ample opportunities and means for both
sides to assess and evaluate the credibility and veracity of the actions
of the other side.

#### Taiwan arms sales are key

However, **[[there is no other foreign relations issue that inflames
Beijing]{.mark} \-- and ordinary Chinese \-- [more than the arms sales
issue. The U.S. cannot ignore the]{.mark} strong [Chinese nationalistic
sentiments over Taiwan]{.mark}. China has always considered Taiwan as an
inseparable part of itself]{.underline}**. There is no need to go
through further legal routes to vindicate China's sovereign claim over
the island. But under America\'s "one-China\" policy, the fate of Taiwan
remains "undecided,\" thereby validating these arms sales. This policy
was initiated in 1979 but has not changed for 32 years. During this
period, China has changed tremendously and has become the most important
business partner to the U.S. In the coming decades, the U.S.-China
relations will only become more important.

**[Without any new policy]{.underline}** framework to recalibrate these
arms sales, **[mainland Chinese will continue to be wary of the
U.S]{.underline}**. Understandably, this issue cannot be solved quickly.
Washington and Beijing must work together to find ways to tackle the
challenges.

#### Issues regarding Taiwan must be solved before the trade war can end

**Cowen 7/15**(Tyler -- professor of economics @ George Mason
University, "What the U.S.-China Trade War Is Really About", Bloomberg,
7/15/19, <https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-15/u-s-china-trade-war-s-main-issues-are-taiwan-and-huawei>)

During my recent travels in Taiwan and China, I was asked repeatedly:
What does America really want out of the trade war with China? In the
interests of mutual understanding, here is my brief guide to America's
conflicting and complicated motives. [Spoiler alert: The tariffs may get
more attention, but the critical issues are]{.underline}Huawei
and [Taiwan.]{.underline}Start with President Donald Trump, who himself
has mixed motives. He has favored tariffs and protectionism since the
1980s, when he focused on Japan. For better or worse, protectionism
seems to be one of Trump's most sincere views. Yet Trump also fancies
himself a deal-maker, and he would like to strike a deal with China to
cement his legacy and boost his re-election chances in 2020. Those two
motives are in tension with each other. More and higher tariffs limit
the chances of making trade deals. Then consider the U.S. ruling elite,
namely the policy community, business leaders, media and the
establishment wings of the two major political parties. All of these
groups are likely to favor free trade and trade agreements, although
they are willing to make exceptions for national security reasons (this
exception, as we shall see, turns out to be important for the prospects
of a China deal). There is also a subset of the Democratic Party that
identifies closely with labor unions and does not favor free trade. The
new player in the trade game is the national security establishment. It
is very worried about the rise of China and the spread of Huawei
equipment around the world, and it does not have much of a stake in free
trade or the stock market. Furthermore, the national security
establishment is used to getting its way; when bargaining with other
U.S. political agents, compromise is not its natural inclination.
Finally, there is the U.S. electorate. American voters are not treating
the trade war as a major electoral issue, at least so far, thereby
giving additional leeway to the other parties involved. Now for some
speculation about what a deal might look like. To see how all these
groups can affect its contours, ask yourself: On which dimensions is a
deal possible? [When it comes to tariffs and Chinese purchases of U.S.
goods, a deal between the two countries should be possible]{.underline}.
The national security establishment will not object, the protectionist
Democrats don't run the show, and I predict that dealmaker Trump will
triumph over protectionist Trump. (To scratch his anti-trade itch, he
can and will impose other
tariffs [elsewhere](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-03/u-s-slaps-import-duties-on-vietnam-steel-in-ramp-up-of-tension).)
The Chinese also could offer stronger intellectual property enforcement
and greater domestic market access for U.S. financial institutions, as
they have already been doing. [One conclusion from all this is that the
trade wars really aren't about tariffs. ]{.underline}Regardless of
whether you approve of any particular bargain, tariff disagreements are
relatively easy to solve.So that means the trade war is really all about
Huawei and Taiwan. If the U.S. persists in trying to eliminate Huawei as
a major company, by cutting off its American-supplied inputs and
intimidating foreign customers and suppliers for Huawei equipment, it
will be difficult for the Chinese to accept. In this case, the
reluctance to make a deal will be on the Chinese side, and the structure
and relative power of the various American interest groups are not
essential to understanding the outcome. The question, then, is whether
the U.S. national security establishment, and in turn Congress (which
has been [heavily
influenced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/china-hawks-fear-trump-is-ready-to-deal-on-huawei/2019/06/27/1093e49c-991a-11e9-916d-9c61607d8190_story.html?utm_term=.b03093c14920)on
this question), will accept a compromise on Huawei. Maybe that means no
Huawei communications technologies for the U.S. and its closest
intelligence-sharing allies, but otherwise no war against the company.
That is the first critical question to watch in the unfolding of this
trade war. The answer is not yet known, though it seems Trump
is [willing](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3011587/donald-trump-says-huawei-could-possibly-be-included-deal-end)to
deal. [The second major question, equally important but less commented
upon, is Taiwan. China has long professed a desire to reunite Taiwanwith
the mainland, using force if necessary. If you belong to the U.S.
national security establishment, and you think a confrontation with
China is necessary sooner or later, if only because of Taiwan, you would
prefer sooner, before China gains in relative strength. And that
militates in favor of the trade war continuing and possibly even
escalating, asthe U.S. continues to push against China and there is
simply no bargain to be had.]{.underline}It is far from clear what a
U.S.-China deal over the status of Taiwan could look like. How much
Americans actually care about Taiwan is debatable, but the U.S. is
unlikely to abandon a commitment that would weaken its value as an ally
around the world. And unlike with Huawei, it is difficult to see what a
de-escalation of this issue might look like. So: If the Huawei and
Taiwan questions can be resolved, then the trade war should be eminently
manageable. Now, does that make you optimistic or pessimistic?
