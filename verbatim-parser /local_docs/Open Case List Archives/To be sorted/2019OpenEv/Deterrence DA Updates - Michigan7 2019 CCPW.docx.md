## ATT 

### Link---ATT Collapses US Sales 

#### ATT is terrible -- five warrants

**Bromund, Ph.D., 2018** (Theodore R., Senior Research Fellow in
Anglo-American Relations at The Heritage Foundation, "Why the Arms Trade
Treaty Is No Answer for the Saudi Problem",
<https://www.heritage.org/arms-control/commentary/why-the-arms-trade-treaty-no-answer-the-saudi-problem>,
11/2)micahw

As part of the reaction to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, and as part of
the wider left-wing preference for siding with Iran instead of Saudi
Arabia, progressives who were already thoroughly in favor of [the Arms
Trade Treaty]{.underline} (ATT) are arguing that Western governments
should ratify it, or uphold it, in order to cut off arms sales to the
Saudis. This [is a terrible argument]{.underline}. First, the [ATT isn't
an answer that its advocates have arrived at]{.underline} out of the
blue. **[It's long been their stock response to virtually anything in
U.S. or Western foreign policy that they find
distasteful]{.underline}**. [They particularly disliked U.S. support for
and arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} -- [partly]{.underline}
[because]{.underline}, as progressives, [they focus almost exclusively
on the purported evils of the West]{.underline}, [partly because they
follow]{.underline} former President [Obama in his foolhardy belief that
Iran will be]{.underline} a [constructive]{.underline} actor
[if]{.underline} only [we are nice to it]{.underline}, and partly
because they are born ambulance chasers. Their view is that, if it
bleeds, it leads. That made the profitless Saudi war in Yemen a natural
focus for their activism. The Saudi murder of Khashoggi has just given
them another opportunity to push the bad idea they have been pushing for
years. Second, backing the ATT because you dislike U.S. (or British, or
French, or Canadian) arms sales to the Saudis is like going into a
restaurant and ordering everything on the menu because you want the
salad. U.S. [arms sales to the Saudis are a policy]{.underline}. It
might be a good policy, or it might be a bad policy -- or it might be a
bad policy that is nonetheless better than the alternatives. But it is
nonetheless just a policy. [The ATT]{.underline}, on the other hand, is
not a policy: it [is a treaty]{.underline}. [By signing onto it, you are
not simply responding to the Khashoggi murder, or to the Yemen war: you
are committing yourself to following the treaty's rules in all future
circumstances.]{.underline} [You are ordering the whole menu for the
sake of the salad]{.underline}. Get exclusive insider information from
Heritage experts delivered straight to your inbox each week. Subscribe
to The Agenda \>\> Third, [if the ATT had existed over the previous
decades]{.underline}, and was interpreted as tightly as its advocates
appear to demand, [it would have imperiled a lot of U.S. arms transfers
that almost everyone would today regard as sensible and
justifiable]{.underline}. U.S. [military aid to Britain before the U.S.
entered the Second World War would be dubiously legal under the
ATT]{.underline}, [because]{.underline} the British
[bombing]{.underline} campaign [against Nazi Germany
inflicted]{.underline} a lot more [civilian casualties]{.underline} than
the Saudis have in Yemen[. Same for U.S. military aid to South
Korea]{.underline}. [Same]{.underline} for U.S. arms supplies [to
Bosnian Muslims]{.underline} resisting Serbian aggression [in the
1990s]{.underline}. [Same for U.S. arms supplies to rebels resisting the
murderous Assad regime in Syria]{.underline}. Fourth, [it
is]{.underline} entirely [possible that the U.S]{.underline}., British,
and French [arms sales to the Saudis are in fact permissible under the
ATT]{.underline}. That was the decision of the British High Court in
2017, and while that decision was not a slam dunk, [it implies that the
ATT is so loose that it does not actually ban much of anything. So the
ATT is the worst of all worlds: it might ban nothing at
all]{.underline}, or it might ban a lot of things, or it might just ban
things that become unpopular with the left. In practice, therefore, it's
not a treaty: it's a political mechanism for achieving particular
outcomes, which is precisely how it's being used today. Funny -- I
thought the left was concerned about the fate of the liberal
international order. Well, treaties that act like treaties -- in other
words, that are agreed, predictable, and enforced -- are part of that
order. But in practice, [the left is entirely willing to ditch the order
for the sake of getting what it wants.]{.underline} The bottom line is
this: **[if you don't like U.S. arms sales to the Saudis]{.underline}**,
**[campaign to change the policy]{.underline}**. I don't agree with you,
but this is a reasonable thing to argue about. **[But don't try to
change the policy by committing the U.S.]{.underline}** -- or any other
nation -- [to a set of rules that might mean everything, or nothing, or
some things at some times and other things at others]{.underline}. That
isn't being responsible. It's creating an instrument that, sooner or
later, is going to be used to constrain U.S. policy in ways that will
make it harder for us to help people who deserve and need our help. In
other words, it is profoundly irresponsible.

### Link---Taiwan Sales Good 

#### Providing arms to Taiwan contains China---pressure is key

States Army, "Experts Say Arms Sale to Taiwan Answer Defense Needs, But
Spur New Questions", *USNI News*,

[A pending sale of F-16 fighters, Abrams tanks, anti-armor and
anti-aircraft missiles, to Taiwan drew rebukes from Beijing but also set
off alarms on the island about its ability retain talent and develop
home-made defenses,]{.underline} one of its leading security experts
said Wednesday. I-Chung Lai, president of the Taiwan-based Prospect
Foundation, said the large arms, aircraft and ship sales of the 1980s
and again in the 1990s inadvertently set off "a brain drain" from the
island and threatened its defense industrial base. ["Our capabilities
and talents started to filter away" to Korea,]{.underline} he said while
speaking at the Heritage Foundation. [Shipbuilders and engineers started
working for businesses and industries in Korea]{.underline} that were
direct competitors with Taiwan but also "filtered into civilian
industries," [especially in technology where the island's expertise is
well-respected.]{.underline} "How can we avoid these things happening
again," Lai asked? [Aside from considering what such sales do to the
Taiwanese industrial base, another **question is whether these the right
weapons** Taipei needs to defend itself from an aggressive
Beijin]{.underline}g. Scott Harald, from RAND's Asia-Pacific policy
center, [said the danger is Taiwan's believing it needs a "one to one"
match with China in weapons and system]{.underline}s. Instead, [Harald
suggested the island needs "dynamic, agile, survivable, lethal" forces,
not necessarily airfields and ports that would be subject to long-range
Chinese missile or air strikes, to deter or defend against an all-out
assault.]{.underline} [Taiwan should consider truck-based anti-ship
missile systems, air-launched cruise missiles, mines, helicopters armed
with anti-armor missiles to attack landing craft, fast attack missile
boats "over big shiny thing" that costs billions,]{.underline} Harald
said. [Taiwan also needs to decide what type of submarine is necessary;
one built domestically or bought overseas]{.underline}. Meanwhile[,
Taiwan needs to **assess the current and future levels of military
threats.**]{.underline} China already operates its navy east of Taiwan
and routinely flies strike aircraft around the island. [Taiwan must
understand whether China could mount a cross-strait
invasion]{.underline} and provocations and incidents similar to the late
1970s confrontations between China and Vietnam. Taiwan also needs to
understand Beijing's short-term goals beyond Taiwan and determine
President's Xi Jin-ping's timeline for achieving reunification with the
mainland, Harald and Lai said. "Is the fight primarily in the heads of
people?" of Taiwanese citizens, leaders of foreign nations and
international organizations, Harald asked. Szu-chien Hsu, Taiwan's
deputy minister for foreign affairs, said Beijing's military intent is
clear and it is "breaking through the First Island Chain," closest to
mainland China to achieve its "very evident ... global strategic
ambitions" of being the leading superpower. Several speakers detailed
how Beijing started ratcheting-up pressure militarily in the South China
Sea, threatening neighbors with economic retaliation for trading with
Taiwan and wooing away Taiwan diplomatic partners through its Belt and
Road infrastructure initiative. China has also sought to dominate
international organizations like the World Health Organization and shuts
out Taiwan officials from its meetings. The goal is to isolate Taiwan by
creating "new norms" of behavior that go unchallenged, Hsu said. China
started escalating its threats toward Taiwan in the late 1990s when
democratic governments replaced what had been an autocratic rule on the
island, Hsu said. The election of Tsai Ing-wen, whose party has favored
remaining apart from the mainland, brought on new waves of pressure from
Beijing militarily, economically and diplomatically to bring the island
under its control. [Beijing started contributing to opposition parties
and using bots on social media to influence]{.underline} [elections and
public opinion on a host of domestic issues.]{.underline}
"Disinformation plays right into most divisive issues" that China uses
to its advantage, Hsu said. "The Chinese Communist Party is good at
making coalitions with lesser enemies to attack larger enemies." Beijing
also works to project a positive image among Taiwanese by inviting
school parties to the mainland and supporting events for local
organizations on the island. Beijing also touts the mainland as the land
of opportunity for young people looking for careers in advanced
technology, engineering and finance. "Taiwan's democratization created
new dynamics \[that weakened its\] coherent response to Chinese threat,"
Lai said. [Harald added, "the non-kinetic aspect \[of applying pressure
to achieve what it wants\] is China's approach. It has not given up
hope" in achieving reunification that way.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales to Taiwan are key to deter Chinese threats

**Horton 19** (Chris Horton, \"Taiwan Set to Receive \$2 Billion in U.S.
Arms, Drawing Ire From China\", No Publication, 7-9-2019,

been writing about Asia for more than a decade, covering topics

TAIPEI, Taiwan --- [The United States has tentatively approved the sale
of \$2 billion in military hardware to Taiwan,]{.underline}
demonstrating support for its unofficial ally in a move likely to
exacerbate deteriorating ties between Washington and Beijing. The
Defense Security Cooperation Agency, part of the United States Defense
Department, notified Congress of two proposed arms sales on Monday. [The
first notification included 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks]{.underline}, [as
well as Hercules armored vehicles and heavy equipment transporters. The
second included more than \$220 million in Stinger antiaircraft
missiles]{.underline}. The tentative approvals come as relations between
the United States and China are already being tested by a trade war and
the decoupling of technology supply chains**[. The armaments would
provide Taiwan with greater deterrence capabilities against the growing
military threat from China]{.underline}**, [experts said.]{.underline}
"These **[tanks and missiles will provide the Taiwan army with a modern
capability to deter and complicate the operational planning of the
People's Liberation Army forces that coerce and threaten
Taiwan]{.underline}**," Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the
U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, said in a statement on Monday. "[They will
also offer new opportunities to engage in cooperation with the United
States in both the deployment and operations phases]{.underline}."
United States lawmakers have 30 days to object to the sale, but they are
considered unlikely to do so. The approvals come as Taiwan's president,
Tsai Ing-wen, prepares for a trip this week to North America, a visit
that could further anger Beijing. The Taiwanese government said her
first stop would be New York. The United States broke formal diplomatic
ties with Taiwan's government in 1979 in order to establish relations
with China's Communist government, which claims the self-governing
island as its territory and has threatened to unify it with the mainland
by force. Shortly after the end of the formal alliance, along with the
American military presence there, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations
Act, which requires that the United States provide Taiwan with weapons
of a defensive nature to deter an attack from China. In 1982, the United
States broadened its support with a document known as the Six
Assurances, the first of which stated that Washington would not set a
date for ending arms sales to Taiwan. [Chang Tun-han]{.underline}, a
spokesman for Ms. Tsai, [welcomed the news of the tentative arms sales
approvals on Tuesday.]{.underline} "[The American government continues
to take concrete actions to fulfill its commitments under the Taiwan
Relations Act and the Six Assurances]{.underline}, [assisting Taiwan in
strengthening its defensive capabilities,"]{.underline} Mr. Chang said
in a statement. "We express our deepest gratitude." At a regularly
scheduled news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, Geng Shuang, spokesman
for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, expressed opposition to the sales,
saying they could harm relations between China and the United States.
China has already expressed displeasure with Ms. Tsai's plans to spend a
total of four days in the United States, part of a trip in which she
will also visit diplomatic allies in the Caribbean. Taiwan's deputy
foreign minister, Miguel Tsao, announced on July 1 that Ms. Tsai would
spend two nights in the United States before and after visiting the
Caribbean countries of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, St.
Kitts and Nevis, and Haiti from Thursday to July 22. In addition to the
recently approved arms packages, Taiwan in late February also requested
66 F-16V fighter jets from the United States. And in April, Washington
approved a \$500 million package that included F-16 parts and training.
Mr. [Hammond-Chambers]{.underline} of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council
[said the Trump administration]{.underline}, with broad support from
Congress[, had moved to regularize and normalize arms sales to
Taiwan,]{.underline} **[reflecting "a sound and responsible policy that
will maximize the deterrent nature of a modern, well-equipped Taiwan
military]{.underline}** [capable of complicating and deterring any
actions by the P.L.A."]{.underline} An official with Taiwan's Ministry
of National Defense, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that he
expected the F-16 sales to go forward, saying that ties with Washington
under the Trump administration were the strongest since official
diplomatic relations ended 40 years ago.

#### US arms sales to Taiwan are key to repel Chinese maritime superiority over the strait

[The Trump administration's plan to sell tanks, missiles and
ground-launched air defenses to Taiwan embodies what might be called a
strategic paradigm shift to empower the small island's deterrence
posture against an often-threatened Chinese invasion]{.underline}. While
much existing discussion centers upon strengthening Taiwanese air, sea
and undersea defenses, [there also appears to be an unequivocal need for
major land defenses]{.underline}. The existing air-sea emphasis is
extremely important, yet [there are certainly elements of this approach
which invite further discussion about the need to provide Taiwan with a
strong, armored ground force as well.]{.underline} The proposed \$2
billion arms package includes 108 main battle tanks, 250 Stinger
anti-air missiles, as well as 409 Javelins and 1,240 TOW anti-tank
missiles. Drawing heavily upon a US Pacific presence along with
Asian-theater allied support, **[a maritime-air Taiwan defense strategy
has clearly had a deterrence impact in recent years]{.underline}**. Part
of [this ability to keep a Chinese invasion at bay has]{.underline}
naturally [hinged upon a strong US posture ensuring defense of the
island.]{.underline} A cursory look at US arms sales to Taiwan in recent
decades reveals a maritime strategic emphasis: [the US has sold
frigates, amphibious ships, harpoons and key air assets such as Chinook
and Blackhawk helicopters.]{.underline} While these initiatives are,
quite obviously, not useless \-- **[there have been some significant
factors that have emerged in recent years which, without question,
change the deterrence landscape.]{.underline}** [Taiwan received some
Patriot]{.underline} (PAC-3) air [defense missiles during the George W.
Bush administration]{.underline}, **[yet Taiwan has overwhelmingly
purchased maritime defenses]{.underline}**. They have also received
air-to-ground and air-to-air weapons, torpedos, and ship-fired SM-2
missiles. Simply put, [China's accelerated naval modernization plan
continues to alarm many at the Pentagon.]{.underline} The Chinese are
not only on a fast track to build indigenous aircraft carriers but also
moving quickly on new submarines, amphibs, destroyers, corvettes and
other maritime assets, leading many to assess that the Chinese Navy may
in fact be passing the US Navy in sheer size. In effect, this means that
**[any kind of Chinese sea-air focused attack could meet with success at
great cost to the pro-US nations in the area]{.underline}**. Several
Congressional US-China Economic and Security Reviews released in recent
years, along with an Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) report specify
concern about Chinese naval weapons and platform modernization. [The
Chinese are known to be working on more YUZHAO LPDs]{.underline} -
[amphibious attack vehicles which can carry 800 troops]{.underline},
four helicopters and up to 20 armored vehicles, according to the
Congressional assessment. [China's surface fleet is also bolstered by
production of at least 60 smaller, fast-moving HOUBEI-class guided
missile patrol boats]{.underline} and ongoing deliveries of JIANGDAO
light frigates armed with naval guns, torpedoes and anti-ship cruise
missiles. Furthermore, [while Chinese attack submarine expansion is
widely known, an often less-recognized fact is the rapid development of
heavily-armed LUYANG III destroyers]{.underline}, equipped with
anti-submarine weapons and new, vertically-launched anti-ship cruise
missiles. [ONI also raised concerns about China's nuclear-armed
ballistic missile submarine force]{.underline}, to include the Jin-class
submarines \-- bringing China\'s "first credible at-sea-second-strike
nuclear capability,\" the ONI report states. The submarine would fire
the JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missile, which has a range of
4,000 nautical miles and would \"enable the Jin to strike Hawaii, Alaska
and possibly western portions of CONUS \[continental United States\]
from East Asian waters,\" ONI assessed. [Given this circumstance, it is
quite reasonable to observe that, in the event of some kind Chinese
attack, **Tawainese and allied maritime power alone may not be
sufficient**]{.underline}. Accordingly, **[a credible ground force
fortified by tanks and air-defense missiles does two clear things: it
could very well further deter China by virtue of ensuring a
high-casualty ground war]{.underline}** [and also force China to transit
heavy forces across the ocean**. That kind of heavy deployment is never
easy**]{.underline}, and certainly not without major risk of air and sea
attack. **[Both of these factors seem]{.underline}**, without
question[**, to further strengthen Taiwan's deterrence strategy**. Even
if China believes it would ultimately prevail]{.underline} in a ground
invasion against Taiwan, [the promise of a credible Taiwanese ground
threat does change the equation]{.underline}. **[This could also
decrease the possibility of any needed US intervention]{.underline}**.
In particular, Javelin anti-tank missiles, TOW missiles and Stinger
anti-aircraft weapons would certainly enable a Taiwanese defense force
to target Chinese tanks, helicopters, armored vehicles and even drones.
Looking back over the past decade, this history underscores the fact
that the current Trump administration posture, as evidenced by the
proposed sale, signifies what could be called an ambitious new step in
US Pacific strategy.

[Arms acquisitions and the upgrading of the domestic defense industry
will have to dovetail with a new military doctrine planned by Taipei's
strategists, who must cope with a manpower shortage and financial
constraints]{.underline}. In early March, the defense minister announced
that [Taiwan would adopt a strategy of "**multiple deterrence**" to
prevent enemy forces]{.underline} (i.e. China) from entering its
territory by air, land or sea. In Feng's words, [the Taiwanese armed
forces will have to develop asymmetrical tactics to push the enemy into
"multi-dilemmas.]{.underline}" The deployment of Patriot Advanced
Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile batteries on Taiwan's east coast is part of
this strategy, as well as the reinforcement of early-warning systems,
the improvement of cyber capabilities and the development of smart sea
mines and unmanned aerial vehicles for combat and reconnaissance
missions. [But new weaponry and strategic doctrines alone cannot help
Taiwan close the military gap with China.]{.underline} And these moves
will end up worsening cross-strait relations. To deter China, and
protect its territory, **[Taiwan needs America's active support, both in
political and defense terms.]{.underline}** But President Tsai's push to
develop and produce Taiwan's own arms suggests she is wary of Trump's
real commitment to the country's security.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates on Sept. 24 [announced a
new set of arms sales to Taiwan. Valued at \$330 million, this sale
comprises]{.underline} mainly spare parts and equipment to support
Taiwan's air force, including [its F-16s and C-130s]{.underline}. [This
marks the second major arms sale to Taiwan by]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration, following a \$1.4 billion sale in
June 2017 that included long-range missiles and heavy torpedoes. [Not
surprisingly, Beijing promptly denounced the sale.]{.underline} The
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman declared that "[the U.S. arms sales
to Taiwan severely violates the international law]{.underline} \[and\]
the basic norms governing international relations." The Chinese Defense
Ministry spokesman warned that the U.S. move severely violated
U.S.-China relations, "interfered with China's domestic affairs and
harmed China's sovereignty and security interests, and seriously damaged
China-U.S. ties, relations between the two militaries, as well as peace
and stability across the Taiwan Strait." [The arms sales announcement
came not only amid another round of tariffs in the slowly escalating
trade clashes between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
China, but also right after the U.S. imposed sanctions against
the]{.underline} Chinese People's Liberation Army ([PLA]{.underline}).
Because the Chinese purchased Su-35 fighter jets and S-400
surface-to-air missiles from Russia, the U.S. announced sanctions
required by the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act
of 2017 against the PLA's Equipment Development Department and its
director, Lt. Gen. Li Shangfu. The Chinese, meanwhile, canceled a
meeting between Vice Adm. Shen Jinlong (head of the Chinese navy) and
U.S. Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson with only 48 hours'
notice. They also denied the USS Wasp access to Hong Kong for a port
call. It is unclear whether these Chinese actions are more in response
to the sanctions or the arms sales, or perhaps the broader deterioration
of U.S.-China ties. [The new arms sales will help Taiwan maintain some
semblance of **credibility in its own defense**, especially in the air.
As China has increased its **pressure** on Taiwan]{.underline} (e.g.,
employing financial diplomacy to erode Taiwan's diplomatic standing),
[**preserving Taiwan's** ability to **maintain** control of its own
airspace will be vital.]{.underline}

#### Fear of US draw-in from tripwire threats deters Chinese invasions in Taiwan

[There are three primary takeaways from the 1954-1955

mobility]{.underline}**. [Each time TPF elements steamed into the
Dachens region]{.underline} (about 200 miles north of the normal TPF
patrol[), the PLA delayed plans to attack.]{.underline} However, the PRC
did not cancel invasion plans and therefore as a 'show of force' the
naval maneuvers were a failure. They did not constrain Mao from
continuing with the conventional war strategy in the future. [The TPF
was effective in the Dachens when present as a tripwire. Concern over
direct contact between PLA and US forces postponed the Dachens
invasion]{.underline}. The failure of the tripwire was its impermanence.
The TPF had a static presence in the Taiwan Strait with nearly 24/7
patrols and making port in Taiwan. The tactical mobility of the TPF in
the Strait was effective. The strategic mobility up to the Dachens was
not, and could only delay a conventional war strategy. [The second
takeaway is the power of the nationality threshold when backed with the
capacity to escalate]{.underline}. **[The evidence builds confidence in
the hand-tying nature of the nationality threshold in deterring
conventional war]{.underline}** and some direct aggression strategies
versus the sunk cost logic of large scale shows of force that are either
impermanent or not located in the possible line of advance. [Mao viewed
the Dachen operation as higher risk]{.underline} than the shelling of
Quemoy [because it risked direct combat between PRC and US combat
forces]{.underline}. Mao viewed the shelling of Quemoy as low risk
because it would not pit PLA and US military forces against one another.
Ironically, the initial salvo killed nonpublic US advisors, and the US
responded with a massive influx of naval and air power. The PRC's
concern for the nationality threshold is visible in the strict rules of
engagement to avoid US combat forces contrasting with the approval of
attacks against 218 Nationalist-only forces. Mao forbid air attacks on
the Dachens when US naval ships were in the area. In doing so, Mao
showed concern escalation by the PLA air force and US naval forces
coming into direct contact despite the ROEs. It appears that the PLA was
more willing to allow naval operations against Nationalist forces when
US forces were in the region in contrast to air power. This may be
because PT boats have more time to accurately discriminate targets and
identify nationality before attacking where air forces were more prone
to mistakes. Like the French forces in the Chad case, it is difficult
for a tripwire force posture to prevent low levels of direct aggression
against protégé only forces because the aggressor military can avoid the
small numbers of tripwire forces in limited raids associated with direct
aggression. However, the tripwire force is effective in preventing a
strategy of conventional war where avoiding the tripwire would be highly
unlikely[. **The final point is the overlapping nature of conventional
and nuclear deterrence in the crisis.** Mao and PLA planners clearly
wanted to avoid engaging and killing US combat forces]{.underline}.
While [Mao considered and was concerned about the US nuclear
arsenal,]{.underline} there is evidence he believed the PLA could fight
a limited conventional war against the US on the Chinese mainland, but
with US naval and air superiority China assessed the chances of taking
Taiwan or the offshores as very low. [He was also]{.underline} acutely
[aware that the overwhelming US conventional superiority]{.underline}
with snap forward forces [meant that attacking and killing US forces
would bring massive reinforcements making any]{.underline} amphibious
conventional [war strategy unlikely to succeed.]{.underline}

### China Revisionist 

#### China's [revisionist]{.underline} and accommodation is a [springboard]{.underline} for aggression --- their authors are [lying]{.underline} to you [Brands](https://tnsr.org/author/hal-brands/) and [Cooper](https://tnsr.org/author/zack-cooper/), 19 -- Hal Brands: Distinguished Professor of Global Affairs at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.

Although the Trump administration has pushed the relationship toward
greater competition, some [experts believe]{.underline} that [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China should manage their
differences by striking a "grand bargain]{.underline}." Charles [Glaser
suggests]{.underline} that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should **end its commitment to Taiwan** in exchange for China
peacefully resolving its maritime disputes]{.underline} and accepting a
long-term U.S. military presence in the Indo-Pacific.8 Lyle Goldstein
argues that the two countries should work together to encourage the
development of "cooperation spirals." [Chinese leaders]{.underline}, for
their part, have [touted "**win-win" solutions** and a new model of
great-power relations]{.underline}.9 The attraction of accommodation is
obvious. If successful, it would avoid the costs associated with
prolonged political, economic, military, technological, and ideological
competition, and it would facilitate compromise on issues such as
climate change, where joint U.S.-Chinese action is sorely needed. [The
logic of this approach is]{.underline} equally straightforward: [If the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has failed to shape Chinese
behavior through]{.underline} a combination of [engagement]{.underline}
and hedging, [then it should seek to defuse the emerging confrontation
before the balance of power becomes even less favorable]{.underline}.
[Unfortunately, **accommodation is a bad bet**]{.underline} for several
reasons. First, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [cannot
simply "make a deal" on]{.underline} many core [issues since those
issues have to do with]{.underline} the territory and [interests of U.S.
allies]{.underline} and partners. [Washington does not]{.underline}
itself [claim the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands]{.underline},
[Scarborough]{.underline} Shoal, [or Taiwan, so it **cannot relinquish
those claims**]{.underline}. [Entering negotiations]{.underline} with
Beijing [over the heads of]{.underline} leaders in [Tokyo, Manila, and
Taipei would undermine the U.S. network of alliances and
partnerships]{.underline}. [U.S. leaders would]{.underline} thus [find
it difficult to strike a]{.underline} grand [bargain unless they are
also willing to]{.underline} entertain **[withdraw]{.underline}**ing
**[from the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. Second, [neither]{.underline}
U.S. nor Chinese [leaders can have]{.underline} much [confidence that a
bargain struck]{.underline} now [would hold in the future.]{.underline}
At times of flux in the international hierarchy, established powers
often hesitate to conclude grand bargains because they fear that the
rising power might simply seek to renegotiate the deal later, when the
balance has shifted further in its favor. So [even if the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [cut a deal]{.underline} that
satisfied China in the short term, [there is little guarantee that
Beijing would remain satisfied if its influence continued to
grow.]{.underline} In fact, [accommodation could incentivize **greater
Chinese revisionism** by signaling declining U.S. willingness to defend
its interests]{.underline} or by giving Beijing control of valuable
territory --- [such as Taiwan]{.underline} --- [that could serve as a
**springboard to future aggression**.]{.underline}10 [Chinese leaders
are]{.underline} also [likely to be **skeptical**]{.underline} of a
grand bargain [given that]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates has [walked away from]{.underline} major
[agreements signed in recent years]{.underline} --- [most notably the
**Iran nuclear deal** and the **Paris climate accord**]{.underline}.
Finally, perhaps because of the reasons listed previously,
[leaders]{.underline} in Washington and Beijing [appear averse to a
grand bargain]{.underline}. Although **[Trump]{.underline}** vaguely
floated the idea in the months after his election, and there remains the
possibility of a broad economic deal to deescalate the bilateral trade
war, his administration [recently and publicly **dismissed a broader
strategy** of accommodation aimed at a comprehensive settling of
differences]{.underline}.11 [Future U.S. administrations are likely to
do the same]{.underline}, given that [both Republicans and
Democrats]{.underline} have [strongly criticized China]{.underline}'s
security activities, economic practices, and human rights violations.
Meanwhile, **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping has [provided **few
indications** that he is willing to make serious
compromises]{.underline} in pursuit of a deal. [Quite the opposite: His
recent speeches on both foreign and domestic policy have been strident
and confident]{.underline}.12 Even if a grand bargain is theoretically
possible, it is probably not in the cards.

[For decades]{.underline}, U.S. leaders undertook a largely consistent,
bipartisan approach to China. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [sought to integrate China into the global
economy]{.underline} by opening its markets and welcoming China into the
World Trade Organization. Wa[shington also pushed Beijing to assume a
greater role in]{.underline} regional and [global affairs]{.underline}.
U.S. [leaders hoped that]{.underline} their [efforts would]{.underline}
illustrate the benefits of membership in the existing order and [induce
China]{.underline}, as Robert Zoellick explained in 2005, [to
"work]{.underline} with us [to sustain the international
system]{.underline} that has enabled its success."1 In the meantime,
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [committed to maintain the
military capabilities and alliances necessary to dissuade China from
taking a more confrontational pat]{.underline}h.2 The
responsible-stakeholder paradigm offered a coherent "theory of victory":
It identified a desired outcome and employed all elements of American
power to bring about that outcome. Over time, the strategy produced
greater Sino-American cooperation on a range of issues, from
counterpiracy to climate change. [It is increasingly clear]{.underline},
[however, that the **responsible-stakeholder strategy
failed**]{.underline}. [Two of its core assumptions]{.underline} now
[appear misplaced]{.underline}: [the idea that China's intentions would
become more benign]{.underline} over time, [and]{.underline} the belief
[that Washington had the power to keep Chinese ambitions in
check]{.underline} until that shift occurred[.]{.underline} [What
happened instead was that, as China rose]{.underline}, [the
C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty [became
more willing to use its newfound power in **coercive and disruptive
ways**]{.underline}.3 Confounding Western hopes that China would
liberalize, [the C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist
[P]{.underline}arty [embraced more **repressive policies**, **especially
after Xi** Jinping became general secretary]{.underline} in 2012.
Meanwhile, [Beijing sought to **control the Indo-Pacific region** by
coercing its neighbors, **undermining U.S. alliances**, practicing
**mercantilist policies,** steadily increasing its presence and
influence in the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea, and [modernizing its military.]{.underline} In
the Indo-Pacific and beyond, moreover, [China has engaged
in]{.underline} a range of behaviors that challenge American interests:
[supporting authoritarian regimes]{.underline}, [engaging]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} widespread [corruption]{.underline}, [pursuing
**predatory trade practices** and major geo-economic projects meant to
project Chinese influence]{.underline} further afield, [seeking to
stifle international criticism of its h]{.underline}uman
[r]{.underline}ights [abuses]{.underline}, practicing massive
intellectual property theft, [and striving for
tech]{.underline}nological [dominance in]{.underline} critical emerging
fields, such as [artificial intelligence]{.underline}. Recently,
[China's confidence has been on display, with Xi stating]{.underline} in
2018 [that "no one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese
people]{.underline}," [after declaring]{.underline} in 2017 [that China
is ready to "take **center stage in the world**]{.underline}."4 Rather
than becoming a responsible stakeholder in a U.S.-led system, C[hina
appears increasingly determined to **compete with Washington for
primacy**]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. [These more
assertive policies have been made possible by]{.underline} China's
surprisingly **[rapid growth]{.underline}**. Between 1990 and 2016,
[China's constant-]{.underline}dollar [gross domestic product increased
roughly twelvefold and its **military spending grew
ten-fold**]{.underline}.5 [The People's Liberation Army rapidly
developed the tools]{.underline} --- [**anti-ship missiles, quiet
submarines, advanced fighter aircraft, and integrated air defenses** ---
needed to contest American supremacy]{.underline} in the Western Pacific
a[nd give China greater ability to shape]{.underline} events in [its
region and beyond]{.underline}. [Surging national wealth]{.underline}
also led to an explosion of Chinese trade, lending, and investment
abroad, which [enabled far more **ambitious geo-economic
statecraft**]{.underline}. All told, this [expansion of Chinese national
power]{.underline} is unprecedented in modern history. It
[has]{.underline} dramatically narrowed the gap between China and the
United States and [made it far more difficult for Washington to shape
Beijing's behavior.]{.underline}

## Drones

### Link---Drone Sales Good 

#### Trump's new drone policy is key to deterrence posture---promotes alliances, promotes interoperability and promotes US influence 

**Lin-Greenburg 18**---Erik Lin-Greenburg, PhD candidate in the
Department of Political Science at Columbia University, where he studies
international relations, previously served as an active duty Air Force
officer, "WHY WASHINGTON'S NEW DRONE EXPORT POLICY IS GOOD FOR NATIONAL
SECURITY", *War on The Rocks*,

April 24, 2018//Lee

When [allies turn to other states for advanced military technology, U.S.
national security suffers in three critical ways. First, **withholding
military technology** from close allies and partners **can strain
security relationships.**]{.underline} Since these [partnerships are
grounded in trust, shared interests, and common threats, partners may
equate a state's unwillingness to export drones with waning loyalty and
commitment to other security agreements.]{.underline} For instance, the
former top Italian Air Force general questioned Washington's initial
denial of Italy's request for armed drones, arguing that "it seemed
impossible that a loyal ally could be ruled out" from receiving armed
drones. He noted that "in Afghanistan, we would have saved Italian lives
if we had had armed drones." [By streamlining the process for foreign
states to acquire U.S. drones, the new policy helps **reduce** this sort
of tension that can engender **mistrust**]{.underline} [and muddy
interactions between Washington and its partners.]{.underline} S[econd,
denying exports can **degrade effectiveness and interoperability**
during coalition]{.underline} [operations]{.underline}. By [not
exporting weapons to allies, supplier states potentially limit the
ability of allies to share operational burdens.]{.underline} For
instance, export controls and international agreements that blocked the
transfer of armed drones to many NATO allies left Washington responsible
for operating the bulk of armed drones in Afghanistan. [This demand
placed additional strain on the already under-manned and overstretched
American capacity. Additionally, if states turn to alternate suppliers,
their ability to easily operate with American forces may be reduced.
Common systems and similar technical infrastructure helps streamline
information sharing, planning, maintenance, and operations. Given the
frequency of coalition operations in the current security environment,
interoperability is key to increasing operational effectiveness and
reducing the likelihood of mishaps and confusion during future crises
and contingencies]{.underline}. [Third, and]{.underline} perhaps
[most]{.underline} strategically [important]{.underline}, [**Washington
loses political and military influence when states turn to other
suppliers.** When a state transfers arms, it hopes to establish
influence in the recipient state throughout and beyond the lifecycle of
the weapon system]{.underline}. In the short term, influence is
established via agreements to train personnel or maintain equipment.
[Producer states design training curricula and can withhold future
deliveries, parts, or maintenance if a recipient takes actions that run
counter to their interests.]{.underline} Over time, [these relationships
often deepen into wider security partnerships. For instance, personnel
who operate U.S.-produced equipment frequently attend training or
exercises in the United States. There, they gain exposure to U.S.
military principles, culture, and values.]{.underline} Because of these
experiences, these personnel may be selected for professional military
education programs like the U.S. Air Force's Air War College later in
their careers. These relationships can strengthen bonds between
personnel from the United States and states that receive U.S.-built
equipment, ensuring long-term American influence. [The new policy makes
it easier for the United States to provide drones to foreign states,
helping to prevent Washington from losing influence to China and other
supplier states who are eager to increase their global
sway.]{.underline}

#### New Export policy does not promote drone prolif---rather promote regional stability 

**Lin-Greenburg 18**---Erik Lin-Greenburg, PhD candidate in the
Department of Political Science at Columbia University, where he studies
international relations, previously served as an active duty Air Force
officer, "WHY WASHINGTON'S NEW DRONE EXPORT POLICY IS GOOD FOR NATIONAL

First, [the transfer of drones is **unlikely** to be inherently
**destabilizing**]{.underline}. [To be sure, the reduced risk associated
with operating remotely piloted aircraft may lead risk-averse
decision-makers]{.underline} to more frequently launch drones on
intelligence gathering and strike missions. [However, limited transfers
of drone technology have had a minimal effect on regional
stability]{.underline}. For instance, [Iraq and Nigeria have used
recently acquired drones to launch missile strikes on suspected
terrorists, but these operations have been limited in scale and
geographic scope. Carrying out worldwide drone operations like those
conducted by the United States requires a massive technological and
logistical infrastructure,]{.underline} and as I describe in a
forthcoming book chapter, a complex backbone of intelligence personnel
and organizations that costs billions and takes decades to develop.
[Even if countries acquire drone aircraft, it takes time to develop the
required network of bases, satellites, computer systems, and personnel
before a state can conduct sustained, large-scale drone
operations.]{.underline}

#### More drones promote crisis stability 

**Lin-Greenburg 18**---Erik Lin-Greenburg, PhD candidate in the
Department of Political Science at Columbia University, where he studies
international relations, previously served as an active duty Air Force

April 24, 2018//Lee

Second[, even if the sale of drones under the new policy triggers drone
arms racing]{.underline}, [remotely piloted aircraft often have a
**stabilizing effect on crisis situations**]{.underline}. As I have
argued elsewhere, drones allow states to carry out military operations
without risking significant escalation. Drones can help stabilize crises
by collecting intelligence that can make subsequent operations more
precise or limited, or can be deployed in lieu of more escalatory means,
like ground forces or manned aircraft. [While states may be more prone
to launch drones on risky missions, states are unlikely to take
escalatory military or diplomatic responses after a drone is lost to
enemy action. In other words, drones provide a de-escalatory off-ramp
that typically is not an option when inhabited assets are
involved]{.underline}. For instance, the Pentagon largely ignored
Syria's downing of a remotely piloted Predator reconnaissance drone in
2015. In contrast, S[yria's recent shoot down of an inhabited Israel Air
Force F-16 fighter in February triggered a massive Israeli retaliation
that reportedly destroyed half of Syrian air defenses.]{.underline}

### Link---MTCR 

#### MTCR crushes deterrence---prevent US from spreading its drones 

**Lin-Greenburg 18**---Erik Lin-Greenburg, PhD candidate in the
Department of Political Science at Columbia University, where he studies

<https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/why-washingtons-new-drone-export-policy-is-good-for-national-security/>,
April 24, 2018//Lee

[As drones become an increasingly common fixture on the modern
battlefield, the new export policy marks an important step in **managing
their proliferation and promoting Washington's national security
interests**]{.underline}. [Streamlining the drone export process helps
Washington **strengthen ties with allies and partners**,]{.underline}
**[enhances interoperability]{.underline}** during coalition operations,
[and limits the ability of competitors to jeopardize U.S.
influence.]{.underline} But more can be done to ensure allies can
acquire U.S. drones. For instance, one retired Air Force general just
called for [changes to the Missile Technology Control Regime that would
reclassify drones like the Reaper and ease their export. Until then,
China and other drone producer states may attempt to woo customers by
undercutting U.S. prices. Or, they might impose fewer political
conditions to sales, allowing exports to states with shadier human
rights records.]{.underline}

#### MTCR limits US ability to export drones---crushes US security interests 

**Zissimos 18**---Rachel Zissimos, Former Policy Analyst, National
Security and Defense Studies, "Export Control Reform: Better Late than
Never", *The Heritage Foundation*,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/export-control-reform-better-late-never>,
April 26, 2018//Lee

As could be expected, [the MTCR has been principally effective in
limiting the sales of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by its
signatories]{.underline}. [The result has been to keep valuable
capabilities away from countries with overlapping security
interests.]{.underline} Meanwhile, China has jumped to meet the global
market demand, exercising far less restraint and discernment about to
whom it will sell both armed and unarmed UAVs. As China expands its
share of the global UAV market, it also expands its influence in the
regulation and use of autonomous systems. [Arms transfers will always
carry a level of risk. But the U.S. is no longer the only player in the
game.]{.underline} The administration's new policy recognizes the
limitations of previous regulations. Now, [the U.S. **must work to
eliminate obsolete and bureaucratic barriers**]{.underline} [to U.S.
exports, including inefficient licensing requirements and outdated
technology controls. A system that is streamlined and responsive to
global economic and security environments will better support U.S.
industries, and advances the best interests of the U.S., its partners,
and allies.]{.underline}

## Japan 

### Link---Japan Sales Good 

#### Japanese alliance insecurity is driven by US flip-flopping over alliance commitments -- maintaining arms sales is key to maintaining US hegemony

strategy: diversifying to re-centre on the US--Japan alliance, The

[Japanese policy-makers may have felt that the arms production and arms
transfer model functioned]{.underline} effectively [for its]{.underline}
overall [grand strategy for most of the post-war and Cold War
periods]{.underline}, [but in the post-Cold War period, this
policy]{.underline}, and indeed, the grand strategy which it serves,
**[have come under increasing stress,]{.underline}** so **[necessitating
revisions across both sets of policies]{.underline}**. [The consistent
pursuit of the Yoshida Doctrine]{.underline}, even in modified form,
[has clearly become more difficult in the context of the shifting
security environment in the Asia-Pacific and beyond]{.underline}.
**[Japan increasingly perceives North Korea's nuclearisation and missile
programmes as existential threats]{.underline}**, [and most acutely
feels the implications of China's rise in regard to territorial disputes
in the East China Sea and maritime securit]{.underline}y (Hughes, 2016).
Japan's security horizon has also been expanded beyond East Asia with
its despatch of the JSDF to support the US 'war on terror' in the Indian
Ocean after 9/11 and the reconstruction of Iraq in the early 2000s, as
well ongoing commitments to anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden
since 2009. At the same time, [**Japanese awareness of broadening
threats and expectations for its contribution to international security
has been accompanied by increasing uncertainties over its ability to
rely on the US as the backstop of its security**, given the perceived
waxing and waning of its ally's power.]{.underline} Japanese concerns at
entrapment have continued, as seen in caution over deployments of the
JSDF in the 'war on terror'. But [fears of abandonment have now also
grown in prominence if Japan is not seen to move beyond previously
minimalist commitments to the alliance and support the US in responding
to North Korean provocations]{.underline} [and China's]{.underline}
[rise]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} most recently [the US 'rebalance'
to the Asia-Pacific]{.underline}. Japanese [policy-makers]{.underline}
have [responded to this new security environment and the
changing]{.underline} [terms of the US--Japan alliance]{.underline}
**[by considering the need to boost their state's own military
capabilities]{.underline}** but most particularly by [strengthening the
alliance relationship with the US in terms of attempts at a closer
shared strategic vision and the integration of military doctrines and
capabilities in areas such as ballistic missile defence]{.underline}
(BMD), [air defense]{.underline}, [maritime security, extended
deterrence, intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance]{.underline}
(ISR), [critical infrastructure protection, mutual logistics support,
and outer space and cyberspac]{.underline}e. [Japan]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} furthermore **[been encouraged to make common cause
with other US allies]{.underline}** and strategic partners, including
Australia, South Korea and India, in managing the regional security
situation. Prime Minister Abe Shinzo's recent security reforms,
including in 2015 the breach on the ban on the exercise of collective
selfdefence to exercise military force in support of the US and other
states under certain conditions, and the revision of the US--Japan
Guidelines for Defence Cooperation for 'seamless' security cooperation
across a range of 'Japan', 'regional' and 'global' scenarios,
demonstrate the ambitions for Japan to shift the functional and
geographical scope of its security policy (Hughes, 2015, pp. 39--54).
Just how far Japan has moved to deviate from the Yoshida Doctrine
remains a subject of intense debate (Hughes, 2017). But at the very
least, it is apparent that [any adjusted or emergent new Japanese grand
strategy features efforts to generate new proactivity beyond
previous]{.underline} legal, functional and geographical
[limits]{.underline}; **[a focus on strengthening the US--Japan
alliance]{.underline}**, whilst still obviating dilemmas of entrapment
but now more prominently abandonment; the **[broadening and deepening of
areas for military cooperation]{.underline}**; and **[testing the
diversification of security cooperation with a new range of US
allies]{.underline}** and strategic partners. If Japan has begun to
shift its overall grand strategy, then this has been matched by
concomitant stresses and changes in its arms transfer policy.
[Japan]{.underline}ese policy-makers and defence producers [have
increasingly concluded that the model of indigenous defence production
is unsustainable]{.underline} in its current prevailing form. The first
challenge is one of resourcing limitations, given the stagnant or
declining defence budgets for much of the period since the late 1990s.
[Japan's government has maintained its one percent of GNP limit
on]{.underline} annual allocations of [defense expenditure]{.underline}
which constrains the overall budget in a period of slow economic growth,
and as a proportion of annual government expenditure it has remained
constant at around five percent, declining in relative importance as a
government priority in comparison to the increasing proportion devoted
to social security and public works (Asagumo Shimbunsha, 2016, p. 283).
[The proportion of the defence budget available for arms production
has]{.underline} also [fallen]{.underline} within the budget, as over
the last 20 up to 45 percent has been directed towards personnel and
provisions (with rising salary and pension costs), whereas the
proportion directed to equipment acquisition has declined from around 23
percent of the budget in 1988 to around 16 percent in 2016 (Asagumo
Shimbunsha, 2015, p. 285).

## Russia 

### Link---Baltics 

#### Facilitating American power projection creates *[tripwire deterrence]{.underline}* which prevents escalation to conventional war 

Matthew C. **Slack**, 20**18**, "Conventional Tripwire Deterrence," The
University of Chicago (American political scientist at the university of
Chicago // NC)

The current US deployment stretches 4,500 troops across Eastern Europe,
often visiting states for a period. They are augmented by regular
exercises that flow in larger NATO forces and practice power projection
with local protégé militaries. The CEPA report is correct in criticizing
the current American deployment and it should be adjusted to provide a
more effective tripwire. First, the US should identify the states most
at risk and begin a permanent rotation of tripwire forces. The Taiwan
case illustrated the dangers of temporary tripwire forces in the face of
a resolved aggressor. Mao simply delayed invasion plans when the TPF
extended its patrol into the Dachens region, and then launched a fait
accompli when US forces were not present. Poland seeks the solution of a
permanent presence, requesting a US base in Polish territory that the
Polish are willing to fund at a cost of 1.5 to 2 billion dollars. 13
Polish decision makers are right to want a permanent US presence so that
Russia is certain that if it attempts to invade Poland that it will meet
US combat forces, tying the hands of the United States to honor its
Article 5 commitment. Second, the tripwire forces deployed to the
Baltics or Poland should be deployed along critical invasion routes or
important political areas that must be captured such as the capitals.
These forces should also employ tactical mobility just as the French
forces did in patrolling the desert by engaging in mobile patrols at
unknown intervals so that their exact location can never be known with
any certainty and therefore cannot be easily bypassed.14 13 Ben

[Tripwire deterrence accepts that the small US and NATO forward
contingent in the Baltics would be unable to defend against or slow down
a Russian conventional war strategy. However, **it predicts that a
tripwire is likely an effective deterrent to Russian conventional
war.**]{.underline} The US has a large advantage over Russia in relative
power. When adjusted for distance to the Baltics the US maintains a 2.5
to 1 advantage in relative power over Russia. US power would also likely
draw upon the combined strength of its NATO allies. 15 The US also holds
a qualitative military advantage over its Russian adversary forces. For
example, despite the proximity of Russia and local quantitative
advantage, the RAND study estimates that the Russian air force could
only create temporarily and geographically localized bubbles of air
superiority for a matter of days against NATO airpower over the
Baltics.16 In their analysis, this is sufficient to secure a fait
accompli due to the lack of US heavy ground forces. Beyond NATO's
military forces and latent power[, the NATO allies also provide regional
access for the massing of the requisite US power to roll back the
Russian advance]{.underline}. [Tripwire deterrence argues that because
the US and the NATO allies hold such an advantage over Russia, the speed
of the US response is much less important]{.underline} than [the
conventional]{.underline} wisdom suggests. Shlapak and Johnson argue
that the US faces a decision after the fall of the Baltic States and the
destruction of US forces there. The [choice is between responding with a
slow conventional buildup and eventual rollback, an unrealistic
compellent nuclear threat of massive retaliation, or acceptance of the
defeat]{.underline}. **[Tripwire deterrence counters that the US does
not face such a decision]{.underline}**. The public and overt death of
American forces by uniformed Russian 15 If all NATO partners are
considered with no losses to alliance inefficiencies, the ratio balloons
to over 5 to 1 NATO advantage. The data uses the National Military
Capability from 2012, the latest year available. Version 5 of Singer, J.

combat forces will inflame such a nationalistic response that US hands
will be tied to respond to honor its commitment to its NATO allies. As
Glenn Snyder argued 'no response' is no longer an option once military
forces are engaged in overt combat.17 Given the large advantage in
American and NATO power, once enough forces are massed they will
counterattack against Russian's initial gains. [In effect, if the
Russians achieve a fait accompli over the Baltics and a US tripwire,
they are essentially selecting a limited aims strategy that will likely
result in the eventual loss of their initial gains, or at best, a war of
attrition with a much stronger foe]{.underline}.18 **[Tripwire
deterrence argues that Russia comprehends this dynamic and Russia is
therefore deterred from ever selecting conventional war.]{.underline}**
The speed of defender response is only salient when the attacker and
defender are near power parity and the capability of the defender to
mass and project enough power to roll back an aggressor is in doubt. In
this case, the logic of two big armies standing toe to toe developed in
the conventional literature reigns supreme and the auspice of quick
victory leads to deterrence failure. In tripwire deterrence, when at
parity, a defender's capacity to escalate requires speed in a snap
forward capability to reinforce the tripwire and slow the attacker's
advance for heavy follow on forces threatening a long war of attrition.
**[This does not mean that recent US investments in power projection
with increased spending on infrastructure construction and prepositioned
equipment is a bad plan.]{.underline}**19 **[Facilitating power
projection before crisis lowers the time and cost of US and NATO
response if a crisis or conflict does break out.]{.underline}**

#### Maintaining the sale of major offensive weapons to GCC states is key to preventing Iranian aggression and prolif -- multiple warrants

Despite these concerns, [there are a number of compelling reasons to
sell major offensive weapons to the GCC states]{.underline}. First,
**[major offensive weapons permit the GCC states to retaliate strongly
against Iran for any instance of low-level aggression]{.underline}**, be
it [terrorism, subversion, or limited military strikes.]{.underline} For
example, [laser- and global positioning system]{.underline}
(GPS)-[guided bombs allow for precision strikes on Iran's vital import
and export facilities in the Gulf]{.underline}, while more powerful
counter-air and counter-air-defense systems will help pave the way for
such attacks. Second, [if Iran chooses to counter-retaliate strongly
against the GCC states]{.underline}, **[major offensive weapons will
help these states limit the damage they will incur while also imposing
additional costs on Iran]{.underline}** for its decision to
counter-retaliate, ideally convincing Iran that further escalation would
not be in its interest. In other words, [major offensive weapons support
the escalation dominance of the GCC states over Iran]{.underline}. As
Michael Knights, a Fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy and a specialist in Gulf military affairs, states, Fostered by
bilateral planning assistance from the United States via the Gulf
Security Dialogue, [**GCC militaries are making rapid advances and may
eclipse Iranian capabilities in the Gulf within ten years.** By
2015,]{.underline} for instance, [the combined forces of the UAE
military]{.underline} [will]{.underline} likely [be able to prevent
Iranian naval operations in UAE territorial waters and EEZs
\[]{.underline}Exclusive Economic Zones\], [seize and hold Iranian-held
islands]{.underline}, [and intercept some Iranian missile and air
attacks on the UAE in the event of a conflict]{.underline}.50 Moreover,
"[encouraging signs suggest that the GCC states will]{.underline} \[by
2015\] [be able to maintain local air superiority over their national
territories and EEZs]{.underline}..."51 Likewise, Anthony Cordesman has
said that [major arms sales proposed by the United States "**can help
create a Saudi Air Force that is more of a threat to Iran than Iran's
conventional missiles are to Saudi Arabia..."**]{.underline}52 [If the
GCC states are thought to have escalation dominance over
Iran,]{.underline} [the effect should be to reduce Iran's ability to
deter retaliation for its low-level aggression]{.underline}, thus
limiting its freedom to commit such aggression in the first place. A
third reason to sell major offensive weapons to the GCC states is that
defensive weapons alone will not likely prove adequate to countering
more intense low-level aggression by a nuclear-armed Iran. No system of
defenses can be perfect, and without some fear of counterattack, an
aggressor could have little reason not to repeatedly test the defenses
arrayed against him. Thus, **[deterrence by the threat of punishing an
attacker can make it far less costly to secure valuable
targets]{.underline}** **[spread over large geographic
areas]{.underline}**. For the GCC states, [trying to defend both
simultaneously and effectively all possible coastal]{.underline} [and
inland targets of low-level attack by Iran could well be
cost-prohibitive.]{.underline} A fourth reason to sell major offensive
weapons is that some of the **[weapons allow for retaliation against
Iran in ways that could minimize the risk of further
escalation]{.underline}**. For instance, [the sale of Storm Shadow
air-launched cruise missiles to Saudi Arabia and the UAE will allow
these states to attack Iran's vital economic facilities]{.underline} in
the Gulf [without sending large formations of fighter, attack, and
defense-suppression aircraft]{.underline} to potentially engage with the
Iranian air force. In fact, it appears Storm Shadow missiles could be
launched from over Saudi or UAE territory and still damage vital
facilities in Iran. 53 The sale of [U.S. ATACMS T2K Unitary missiles to
Bahrain]{.underline} and the UAE woul[d offer a similar capacity for
limited, standoff attacks]{.underline}. [ATACMS is an artillery system
with a range of 270 or 300 kilometers, GPS-assisted guidance, and a
550-pound high-explosive blast/fragmentation warhead]{.underline}.54 If
based in the UAE, [ATACMS could strike the Iranian port of
Bandar-e-Abbas,]{.underline} [which handles some 90 percent of all
containerized shipping traffic in Iran]{.underline}. 55 Similarly,
ATACMS deployed to the eastern tip of Bahrain would threaten Iran's
second-largest oil export terminal, that on Lavan Island. As with Storm
Shadow, ATACMS would not require the GCC states to contest Iran for
local air superiority, something that would tend to increase the risk of
further escalation toward major war. Also, [to the extent Iran or the
GCC states perceive the risk of further escalation resulting from the
use of Storm Shadow or ATACMS to be low]{.underline}, **[the weapons can
be seen as more usable and thus can provide stronger deterrence as well
as escalation control]{.underline}**. A fifth reason to sell major
offensive weapons to the GCC states is that [doing so will
make]{.underline} [it easier for the United States to defend the
region's crucial energy suppliers]{.underline} from large-scale attack.
[Capabilities useful in countering low-level
aggression]{.underline}---for instance, major offensive
weapons---[are]{.underline} of course also relev[ant to deterrence and
defeat of large-scale attack by Iran.]{.underline} [The sale of such
weapons to the GCC states]{.underline} thereby **[helps to alleviate
U.S. defense planning requirements in the Gulf and the budgets they
absorb]{.underline}**. This rationale has become especially important in
recent years as the United States has sought to rebalance its strategic
focus with more weight given to Asia while grappling with serious
financial challenges at home. Sixth, [the process of empowering the GCC
states **could also help to dissuade Iran from developing nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} [and convince it to accept strong international
controls on its nuclear program. Iran has to consider that nuclear
weapons are not a security panacea.]{.underline} While they are
considered very useful in deterring threats to vital interests, [their
deterrent value is seen to diminish with the importance of the interest
at stake]{.underline}. Hence, a key question for Iran is whether a small
nuclear force, in the absence of relatively strong nonnuclear military
capabilities, would provide enough deterrence to permit low-level
aggression on a greater scale than is safely possible today. There is a
risk it would not. While there has been no definitive U.S. policy
statement on the matter to date, [the GCC states are nonetheless
understood to enjoy the backing of U.S. nuclear and conventional
forces,]{.underline} including missile defenses and preemptive strike
capabilities. 56 [If these states build up their conventional
power]{.underline} [to eclipse Iran's nonnuclear military power in the
Gulf, **Iran's freedom to commit low-level aggression could diminish in
net terms**]{.underline} [even after acquiring nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} It is perhaps for this reason that in a September
7, 2009 interview with Al Jazeera, then-U.S. Defense Secretary Robert
Gates stated the following: ...[one of the pathways to get the Iranians
to change their approach on the nuclear issue is to persuade them that
moving down that path will actually jeopardize their
security]{.underline}, not enhance it. So [the more that our Arab
friends and allies can strengthen their security capabilities**, the
more they can strengthen their cooperation, both with each other and
with us**]{.underline}. I think [this sends the signal to the Iranians
that this path they're on is not going to advance Iranian security but
in fact could weaken it.]{.underline}57 Granted, precisely how the GCC
states will react to more intense low-level aggression by a
nuclear-armed Iran cannot be known at this time. Even with superior
nonnuclear forces, these states might still prefer to submit to stronger
Iranian demands of them, choosing appeasement rather than
counterattacking and risking major war with a nuclear-armed power.
Nevertheless, [Iran's leaders will understand that the GCC states are
now spending considerable sums on acquiring major offensive
weapons.]{.underline} They can draw several lessons from this. First,
given their timing, [large-scale purchases of major offensive weapons by
the GCC states are difficult to explain absent the need to retaliate for
Iran's low-level aggression]{.underline} and dominate any ensuing
contest in non-nuclear escalation. Therefore, [such purchases are a sign
that the GCC states have the political]{.underline} [will to resist an
expansion of Iran's influence in the region]{.underline}. Second, [major
offensive weapons give GCC states]{.underline} [**the option of
effective resistance,** whether or not they choose to exercise that
option]{.underline}. This fact alone increases the risk for Iran as its
weighs the potential nearand long-term costs and benefits of its nuclear
posture. Third, [if in the future a nuclear-armed Iran]{.underline}
[chooses to intensify its low-level aggression,]{.underline} the [**GCC
states will have many billions of dollars of "sunk costs"** in the form
of strike fighters,]{.underline} [missiles, guided bombs and the
like]{.underline}, strengthening arguments for the use of these weapons.
Taken together, these factors underscore the risk apparently referred to
by then-Secretary Gates: that Iran's current nuclear policies will
ultimately make the country worse off in terms of its power and
security. A final reason to sell major offensive weapons to the GCC
states is that the [weapons can substitute for direct U.S.
action]{.underline} to counter low-level aggression by a nuclear-armed
Iran. **[Direct U.S. action is undesirable because it is dangerous and
risks being ineffective]{.underline}**. Direct U.S. action would have
two components: direct defense and deterrence. [With direct
defense]{.underline}, [U.S. forces would intercept and defeat limited
attacks by the Iranian armed forces]{.underline} against critical
targets in the GCC states. [With deterrence, the United States would
signal its intention to retaliate]{.underline} against Iran for [using
low-level aggression against the GCC states.]{.underline}

## Ukraine 

### Link---Ukraine Sales Good 

#### Supplying Ukraine with lethal weaponry to increase the cost of a Russian invasion sends a signal of *[deterrence credibility]{.underline}* 

Steven **Pifer and** John **Herbst**, 11-17-20**17**, \"Why Trump should
arm Ukraine,\" Brookings,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/11/17/why-trump-should-arm-ukraine/>

Ambassador to Ukraine from September 2003 to May 2006. Steven Pifer is a

Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative // NC)

President Trump has often expressed his desire to build a better, more
positive relationship with Russia. However, as Secretary of State
Tillerson has said, improved bilateral relations will not be possible
without ending Russia's aggression against Ukraine. Washington has
energized its diplomatic effort to settle the conflict, as demonstrated
by the appointment of Kurt Volker as special envoy. But that more robust
diplomatic effort needs backing by other steps, such as sanctions, to
encourage the Kremlin to change its approach. It is also time for Mr.
Trump to end the Obama administration's policy of denying lethal
defensive assistance to Ukraine. In the aftermath of the 2014 Maidan
Revolution in Kyiv, Russian military forces seized Crimea, which Moscow
promptly and illegally annexed. Shortly thereafter, the Kremlin launched
a covert, hybrid war in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas; it began
with Russian leadership, funding, heavy weapons, ammunition and
"volunteers"---but, at critical moments, regular units of the Russian
army joined in. Three years of fighting have left some 10,000 dead.
Moscow could have ended the skirmishing at any time by abiding by the
cease-fire and withdrawal of heavy weapons agreed to in the Minsk
agreements of September 2014 and then February 2015. But the Kremlin has
never implemented those provisions, preferring instead to maintain a
simmering conflict as a means to pressure and destabilize the Ukrainian
government. [The United States began assisting the Ukrainian military's
efforts to defend Donbas in 2014. Some of that
assistance---counter-battery radars, drones and secure communications
equipment---has proven crucially important to Kyiv's
soldiers.]{.underline} The Obama administration, however, maintained a
policy of providing only non-lethal military assistance. That prevented
the Pentagon from filling a key gap in the Ukrainian army's
inventory---its lack of working man-portable anti-armor weapons---as the
Russian military poured tanks and other armored vehicles into Donbas.
Russian armor was a critical factor in their successful offensives
against Donetsk airport and Debaltseve. When the issue was considered in
2015, many within the U.S. government privately favored providing lethal
assistance. So did Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike. But that
was a decision for the president, and President Obama chose not to do
so. [The rationale for providing lethal military assistance holds true
today. Ukraine's political and military leadership understands that they
cannot drive the Russians and their proxies out of Donbas by force. Kyiv
seeks to bolster its defensive capabilities]{.underline}---that is[,
to]{.underline} be able to [impose more costs on]{.underline} any
Russian attack and thereby [**deter the Russians from a new
offensive.**]{.underline} If Kyiv can deny Moscow easy military options,
that will increase the prospect that the Kremlin will adopt a different
course, one that could lead to a peaceful settlement. Secretary
Tillerson appointed Ambassador Volker this past summer as part of a
reinvigorated American bid to aid the effort to find peace in Donbas and
thereby remove a large obstacle to better relations between Washington
and Moscow. While looking for a way to help the Kremlin out of what
increasingly appears to be a Donbas quagmire, the administration should
also seek to raise the costs to Moscow of its current course. One way is
to increase sanctions, building on the recent legislation enacted by
Congress. Consistent with that legislation, the administration should
specifically sanction the kleptocrats close to President Putin. [Another
way is to provide lethal military assistance. **That would improve the
Ukrainian army's ability to deter and defend**. It **would also send a
strong signal to Moscow that the United States will firmly back Ukraine
against Russian aggression.**]{.underline} One month into the Zelenskiy
presidency and Ukraine's still here Ukrainian soldiers drive a military
vehicle with a torn Ukrainian flag at a checkpoint near Slaviansk in

Slaviansk are thought to have fled since fighters who want eastern
Ukraine incorporated into Russia took control of the city in April, a
month after Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea. Since
then, government forces trying to end the rebellion in towns and cities
across the Russian-speaking region have pounded separatist positions in
and around Slaviansk. Picture taken July 3, 2014. REUTERS/Andrew

IMAGES OF THE DAY) - GM1EA7414HR01 Five years after Crimea's illegal
annexation, the issue is no closer to resolution Indeed, many U.S.
officials favor providing lethal military assistance, and some state so
openly. Last summer, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told
Congress that both U.S. European Command and the Joint Chiefs had
recommended lethal assistance. Recognizing that the United States is
seriously considering providing such assistance, the Kremlin in recent
weeks has shown what may be a hint of flexibility in its approach to its
conflict with Ukraine. By offering a proposal on peacekeepers, however
flawed, Mr. Putin may be hoping to persuade Washington not to provide
defensive weapons to Kyiv. This almost predictable ploy should not work
on the president as he considers this issue. When the supply of lethal
defensive weapons was last seriously considered in the White House in
2015, Mr. Obama took an overly cautious approach. U.S. restraint in that
regard has achieved nothing. Mr. Trump, who has shown a readiness to
take bold action in Syria, should now drop the failed policy of his
predecessor and approve lethal military assistance for Ukraine.

###  AT//Sanctions Solve 

#### Sanctions do not solve---incentivizes them to engage in more conflict 

**Pifer 14**---Steven Pifer, Nonresident Senior Fellow - Foreign Policy,
Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence, Center on the United
States and Europe, Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative,

December 1, 2014//Lee

The [point of sanctions is to alter Russia's approach to Ukraine. Should
Russian policy change in a positive direction, the West will want to
ease sanctions, in order to encourage the Russians to go
further]{.underline}. The administration now has full power to relax
sanctions. [That becomes far more difficult if sanctions have been
mandated by Congress.]{.underline} The United States and Europe have
displayed notable unity on sanctions---and probably surprised Mr. Putin.
If Moscow makes real moves to deescalate the crisis and the European
Union eases sanctions while Congressionally-mandated U.S. sanctions stay
in place, that unity will end. The Russians would exploit the
difference. [Congressional sanctions, moreover, would give the Kremlin a
disincentive to change its policy toward Ukraine.]{.underline} In a
nutshell, Congress is good at applying sanctions, not so good at lifting
them. The Russians know that from bitter experience. The 1974
Jackson-Vanik Amendment denied the Soviet Union and its successor states
permanent normal trade relation status until religious minorities,
principally Soviet Jews, could freely emigrate. After the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, Russia opened the door for emigration. Hundreds of
thousands of Jews left for Israel, America and Europe. Virtually anyone
who wanted to leave could and did. By 1997, Moscow clearly had met the
Jackson-Vanik requirements. Yet it took Congress another fifteen years
to graduate Russia from Jackson-Vanik---and it did so then only as part
of the Magnitsky Act, which applied a new set of sanctions on Russia.
[Congressional sanctions may offer the Hill a feel-good measure, but
they will likely backfire and not help Ukraine. Sanctions aim to
incentivize Moscow to do the right thing and leave Ukraine in
peace]{.underline}. [But if Russian officials believe the sanctions will
remain in place in any case, where do they see an incentive to change
course, especially if they could play Europe off against Washington?
**They would just dig in**]{.underline}. [So, by all means, Congress
should pass legislation to provide defensive weapons to Ukraine. It
should, however, set sanctions aside.]{.underline}

## Deterrence Theory 

### Conventional Deterrence Works 

#### Conventional deterrence theory is true -- risking a war of attrition reduces the risk it will happen in the first place

John J. **Mearsheimer**, 20**17**, "Conventional Deterrence," Cornell
Univeristy Press (John Joseph Mearsheimer is an American political
scientist and international relations scholar, who belongs to the
realist school of thought. He is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished
Service Professor at the University of Chicago // NC)

Although decision makers constantly analyze the balance between the
perceived political benefits and the potential costs and risks of
military action, the final judgment in this dynamic process determines
whether or not deterrence fails.l38 I have emphasized throughout this
chapter that [deterrence is most likely to obtain when a potential
attacker believes his probability of **success on the battlefield to be
low** and the **attendant costs to be high.**]{.underline} Although
raising both the costs and risks of military action significantly
reduces the likelihood of war, however, it does not guarantee that
deterrence will obtain, simply because the political consequences of
continued peace may be so unacceptable that a nation is tempted to
pursue an unattractive course of action. That is, decision makers must
weigh the political risks of not striking in the balance with the
military risks of striking. 139 Let us examine this matter in greater
detail. [Suppose that the political costs of not going to war are not
great, that although there are compelling reasons to consider war, the
decision makers may yet decide either for or against it. In such a case,
**if the costs and risks of military action are thought to be high,
deterrence is almost certain to obtain.**]{.underline} War is likely to
break out only if the decision makers believe that military action will
be relatively risk free and that the attendant costs will be quite low.
Actually, however, the [political considerations that move a nation
toward war are likely to be much more unyielding in nature, hence the
great pressure brought to bear on the military to find a military
solution]{.underline}. Naturally, if a satisfactory plan is found,
deterrence will almost surely fail. The more interesting question is:
What happens if such a solution is not found? [In this case, the risks
of both military action and continued peace are great. The political
consequences of continued peace might be so unac-ceptable as to tempt a
nation to launch a war it did not expect to win. Such a course of action
is most unlikely, for two reasons. First, how could a nation improve its
position by starting a war it expected to lose]{.underline}? As Bismarck
once noted, the nation would be \"committing suicide from fear of
death.\"I40 [Second, the future is unlikely to seem so hopeless that
suicide is warranted]{.underline}. **[In short, if a nation is certain
that failure awaits it on the battlefield, deterrence is very likely to
obtain]{.underline}**.

#### Empirically, the proliferation of NATO's position and proliferation of PGMS prove deterrence theories are true

John J. **Mearsheimer**, 20**17**, "Conventional Deterrence," Cornell
Univeristy Press (John Joseph Mearsheimer is an American political
scientist and international relations scholar, who belongs to the
realist school of thought. He is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished
Service Professor at the University of Chicago // NC)

In the Israeli, German, and Indian cases, a much more attractive
military solution was eventually discovered. Although we can never be
certain, it appears that had the Germans, the Indians, and the Israelis
not discovered the blitzkrieg, they would have launched limited
offensives. Surely the risks would have been considerable (especially in
the German case), but given the pressure in each in-stance to take some
military action, war probably could not have been avoided. Although a
limited aims strategy is hardly ever an attractive option, it is usually
not so unattractive that deterrence obtains in a crisis. Finally, there
are the cases in which, despite the pressure to find an acceptable
military plan, none is forthcoming[. In essence, if the attacker chooses
to go to war, he is likely either to lose or to find himself engaged in
a lengthy war of attrition. Given such circumstances, deterrence is
almost certain to hold, as it did for the Allies at Munich]{.underline}
and again during the months immediately preceding [and following the
start of the Second World War.]{.underline} The Allies, however, did
formally declare war against Germany, although it seems clear that they
would never have attacked Germany had Germany not at-tacked first. Their
decision to declare war highlights the intensity of the pressure to take
military action against Germany. After their humiliating defeat in 1967,
the Egyptians soon carne to believe that some. form of military action
against Israel would be necessary. The Egyptians, however, were deterred
from starting a conventional war because they feared that they would be
defeated. They therefore turned to the war of attrition.28 Conventional
deterrence obtained in the Middle East between 1967 and 1973, although
this state of affairs certainly did not constitute peace. Throughout the
period the Egyptians were preparing themselves to fight against Israel.
By late 1972, they had reached the point where they could seriously
consider engaging the Israelis in a conventional war. Rec-ognizing that
such a course of action entailed serious risks, the Egyptians
nevertheless struck in October 1973. Their behavior clearly shows that
when a nation is dissatisfied with the status quo, the long-term
prospects for deterrence are not promising. The pressure to find an
acceptable military solution will be too intense. \[211 \] Conclusion
THE NATO BALANCE [From our analysis of the conventional balance in
Central Europe, we may conclude that the prospects for conventional
deterrence in some future crisis are quite good.]{.underline} [The
conventional wisdom]{.underline} not-withstanding, [assessment of the
balance of forces and the capabilities of each side makes plain that the
Pact could not presently expect to score a quick and decisive victory
against NATO]{.underline}. Moreover, **[the on-going proliferation of
PGMs appears likely to enhance NATO\'s position in the immediate
future]{.underline}**. [Although these weapons are clearly not \"super
weapons\"]{.underline} that will render the tank extinct, [they make it
more difficult for the Soviets to effect a blitzkrieg and thus can only
increase the likelihood of deterrence]{.underline}. NATO policy makers
have good reason, however, to be very cautious when assessing their
position in some future crisis. For the cases examined here show that,
when a nation has a powerful motive for war, it will go to great lengths
to find a suitable military strat-egy. Military planners will be
subjected to unremitting pressure. Furthermore, a defender who becomes
complacent is likely to be surprised, as were the Israelis in 1973 and
the Allies in May 1940. The central message for status quo powers is
clear: beware in a crisis, because your opponent is seeking a way to
defeat you.

#### Critics of conventional deterrence don't assume new conventional capabilities -- new weapons systems threaten costly wars of attrition that deter conventional war fair

Deterrence: Strategies for Great Power Competition," Strategic Studies

Writing in Foreign Affairs after the first Gulf War, former Defense
Secretary William Perry pointed to a "**[new conventional military
capability" that "adds a powerful dimension to the ability of the United
States to deter war."]{.underline}** Key to this new capability were "a
[new generation of military support systems"---intelligence sensors,
defense-suppression systems, **precision-guided munitions**, and stealth
technologies]{.underline}---that gave true and dramatic meaning to the
term "force multiplier." [To avoid further such foreign entanglements in
the future, Perry argued, the United States needs to use this newfound
strength to deter future wars, not to fight them]{.underline}.11 [The
continued evolution of US conventional capability]{.underline} since
that time, as well as its demonstrated use and capability for long-range
precision strike, [enhances the theory of conventional deterrence for
application in a world of great power competition]{.underline}. [Suppose
a potentially hostile power were to display an interest and a
capability]{.underline}, if not an immediate intent, [to encroach on or
to directly attack American friends and allies]{.underline} or
geographic regions or resources in which the United States has a major
or vital interest. **[Such attacks might be deterred if that state
calculates the results from prospective military action to be
costly]{.underline}**, problematic, and likely not to achieve the
objectives sought---[that is, if it perceived that the United States has
the capability and credibility to defend that state, region, or
interest; force the attacker to pay high costs; and deny that
aggressor's aims.]{.underline} [Therefore, many of those searching for a
military strategy in a renewed great power competition might conclude
that much of **the conventional deterrence theory developed in the past
is still relevant**]{.underline}; the requirements of capability,
credibility, and communication will continue to apply in the future. And
while the central focus of contemporary deterrent relationships has
become multipolar and less nuclear intensive, these were not
relationships left unconsidered in the original development of the
theory. It seems clear, therefore, that reinforcing the logic of
conventional deterrence on its would-be adversaries should be a central
concept of US defense policy over the next decade or so. The principal
stumbling block in attempting to apply that deterrence theory to a
coherent military strategy appears to be the tendency of conventional
deterrence to "fail." If conventional rather than nuclear forces are
about to assume a prominent role in deterring great-power conflict,
theoretical work now needs to be focused on the use or threatened use of
conventional force. How can a policy of conventional deterrence be
communicated and a supporting military strategy and force structure be
shaped? One proposition, diametrically opposed to nuclear deterrence
theory, is that a past "failure" of conventional deterrence may be a
reinforcing, rather than a diminishing, factor: to communicate a
credible deterrent threat, capable conventional military force must be
demonstrated, exercised, and, at times, used.

#### Empirical examples of deterrence failures don't disprove the theory -- rather those failures are consistent with the necessity of credibility and commitment in conventional deterrence -- forward presence of arms sales is necessary to preserve those standards

Because conventional deterrence during the Cold War relied on its
coupling with nuclear capabilities, [past military strategies of
conventional deterrence, as outlined above, seem less relevant to the
new world]{.underline} order than earlier deterrence theory might have
promised. For example, as the theory reminded us, [most failures of
conventional deterrence have resulted from a lack of credibility in the
deterrent threat]{.underline}. Although capability may be evident and an
interest communicated, the resolve of the deterrer is arguably the most
difficult element of the deterrent equation to structure and to assess.
Can the credibility of a conventional deterrent be enhanced for more
effective application in the future? [The requirements and applications
of deterrence theory developed in the previous section suggest three
areas of emphasis: (1) **the visibility of the military force,** (2) a
documented record of **willingness to use force**]{.underline} in the
past, and ([3) the **rationality of the use of force** once deterrence
has failed.]{.underline} Visibility of Military Force [One of the
critical requirements for deterrence has been substantial US forces
deployed overseas]{.underline}, not merely as a symbol or a tripwire but
[as a significant military force to be reckoned with]{.underline}. If
deterrence is to be extended, it must be seen to exist. **[The presence
of US conventional forces probably acted as a restraint on the spread of
nuclear weapons to our allies]{.underline}**, unless they found our
assurances incredible (France) or we lacked the in-place treaties and
troops (Israel). **[A new military strategy based on conventional
deterrence must pose a "virtual presence]{.underline}**," even in a
period of US military retrenchment and overseas base closures. [For
future US conventional forces to deter, they must maintain some form of
visibility to be perceived as credible and capable]{.underline}. To this
end, small-scale exercises with rapid-reacting forces to Europe, as well
as the European Defense Initiative stationing US troops in Eastern
Europe could be helpful. Willingness to Use Force As noted above,
**[conventional deterrence failures have not been inconsistent with
deterrence theory]{.underline}**, [if failing could be attributed to the
**absence of a clear commitment or to insufficient
credibility.**]{.underline} Therefore, just as force visibility can be
enhanced, so can force credibility through measures such as
communicating a commitment, demonstrating resolve, and pointing to past
uses of force. It may be that, owing in part to a past declaratory
policy and practice of preferring diplomatic or economic instruments to
the use of military force, or, even worse, backing away from a declared
redline, potential aggressors may not be persuaded that the United
States will readily respond with force when its interests are
threatened. **[To strengthen credibility, the use of force may be
necessary in some cases for deterrence]{.underline}** The Future of
Conventional Deterrence: Strategies for Great Power Competition to hold
in other crises. In nuclear strategist Tom Schelling's words, "what one
does today in a crisis affects what one can be expected to do
tomorrow."13 Deterrence theory stressed that not being tough enough in a
situation may bring peace only at the expense of one's image of resolve
and, therefore, at the cost of long-term deterrence and stability.14
Rationality of the Use of Force Somewhat ironically, despite its
failures, [conventional deterrence is theoretically more credible in
terms of carrying out deterrent threats than is nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}. That's because once nuclear deterrence fails,
it may be irrational for the deterrer to respond to the challenge owing
to the enormous destruction to his own society that may result. In the
words of Paul Nitze, he may be "self-deterred."15 A conventional
deterrent, however, can be made to appear more certain and, therefore,
more credible: Rationality does not have to fail; the nation does not
have to threaten to stumble into war to respond; doomsday forecasts do
not have to be considered. In practice as well as in theory, there are
more likely to be greater risks and uncertainties resulting from not
carrying out a conventional deterrent threat than in acting to support
declared policy. The operational implication of that theoretical
principle is a strategy of conventional deterrence that allows for the
likely use of military force--- a plausible threat "that leaves
something to chance."16 A central point of these arguments overlooked in
past conventional deterrence theory is that the use of conventional
force, presumed in the past to be a failure of conventional deterrence,
can in the future be a major contributor to the deterrence of
conventional conflict. If that is so, the problem now is that much on
which the United States previously constructed its conventional
deterrent is going away. [US base structure overseas has been rapidly
drawn down, and the United States is moving toward a smaller military
**relying on forward presence** or small footprints rather than forward
deployment]{.underline}, with attendant power projection shortfalls. The
Army is no longer sized to conduct large-scale, sustained stability
operations (let alone to confront a force-on-force scenario) but rather
to carry out small-scale expeditionary missions against unconventional
foes. This brings into serious question the ability of US strategy and
forces to meet the requirements of capability, credibility, and
communication. What military strategies are suited to match an objective
of conventional deterrence with fewer forces stationed abroad in fewer
regions of interest and concern?

Following the Cold War, [conventional deterrence earned an even greater
role in US national security strategy]{.underline}. With the demise of
the Soviet Union and **[significant advancements in conventional
precision-guided munitions, many defense analysts concluded that "smart"
weapons could provide a powerful deterrent against a wide variety of
threats]{.underline}**. While some commentators argued that nuclear
weapons were still necessary to prevent nuclear attacks, and [others
contended that conventional weapons were "the only credible deterrent"
even against nuclear threats,]{.underline} almost all agreed that
**[technologically advanced conventional weapons could now take the
place of nuclear weapons in many missions]{.underline}**.9 [Following
the remarkable success of sophisticated conventional firepower in
Operation Desert Storm, William Perry declared, "This new conventional
military capability adds a powerful dimension to the ability of the
United States to deter war."]{.underline}10 In the current international
security environment, [conventional deterrence can be useful against
nonnuclear and nuclear-armed adversaries]{.underline}. For regimes that
do not possess nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, US
[conventional capabilities will likely be the most credible and potent
deterrent]{.underline}. History suggests that, in general, **[nations
without weapons of mass destruction (WMD) are not intimidated by an
opponent's nuclear capabilities]{.underline}**. [For example, nuclear
weapons did not give the United States significant advantages before or
during the Korean and Vietnam wars; nor did they dissuade Egypt from
attacking Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War11 or Argentina from
attacking the British-controlled Falkland Islands in
1982.12]{.underline} [This circumstance is due in part to the perceived
impact of the "nuclear taboo," a moral and political aversion to using
nuclear weapons that has emerged due to the long absence of nuclear use
in time of war]{.underline}. **[The nuclear taboo reduces the
credibility]{.underline}**---and [therefore the utility---of nuclear
weapons, especially against regimes not possessing nuclear weapons or
other WMD]{.underline}.13 [Although implicit or explicit nuclear threats
may lack credibility against non-WMD regimes, many potential adversaries
believe that the United States will use conventional firepower,
especially because America has conventional superiority and a
demonstrated willingness to use it.]{.underline} Consequently, when
dealing with non-WMD-related threats, [conventional deterrence will be
the most likely mechanism for deterring hostile actions.]{.underline} [A
potential enemy is more likely to attack neighbors if the regime
believes it can accomplish its objectives before US forces
respond.]{.underline} 36 Parameters According to Admiral Michael Mullen,
the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, "**[A big part of
credibility, of course, lies in our conventional
capability]{.underline}**. [The capability to project power globally and
conduct effective theater-level operations . . . remains essential to
deterrence effectiveness."]{.underline}14 Co[nventional deterrence also
plays an important role in preventing nonnuclear aggression by
nuclear-armed regimes]{.underline}. Regional nuclear proliferation may
not only increase the chances for the use of nuclear weapons, but,
equally important, the possibility of conventional aggression[. The
potential for conventional conflict under the shadow of mutual nuclear
deterrence was a perennial concern throughout the Cold War, and that
scenario is still relevant]{.underline}. A nuclear-armed adversary may
be emboldened to use conventional force against US friends and allies,
or to sponsor terrorism, in the belief that its nuclear capabilities
give it an effective deterrent against US retaliation or intervention.15
[For example, a regime might calculate that it could undertake
conventional aggression against a neighbor and, after achieving a
relatively quick victory, issue implicit or explicit nuclear threats in
the expectation that the United States (and perhaps coalition partners)
would choose not to get involved.]{.underline} In this context,
**[conventional deterrence can be an important mechanism to limit
options for regional aggression below the nuclear
threshold.]{.underline}** [By deploying robust conventional forces in
and around the theater of potential conflict, the United States can
credibly signal that it can respond to conventional aggression at the
outset, and therefore the opponent cannot hope to simultaneously achieve
a quick conventional victory and use nuclear threats to deter US
involvement.]{.underline} Moreover, if the United States can convince an
opponent that US forces will be en[gaged at the beginning of
hostilities---and will therefore incur the human and financial costs of
war from the start---it can help persuade opponents]{.underline} that
the United States would be highly resolved to fight even in the face of
nuclear threats because American blood and treasure would have already
been expended.16 Similar to the Cold War, [the deployment of
conventional power in the region, combined with significant nuclear
capabilities and escalation dominance, can help prevent regimes from
believing that nuclear possession provides opportunities for
conventional aggression and coercion.]{.underline}

[Credibility]{.underline}, according to Sir Lawrence Freedman, [is the
"magic ingredient" of deterrence]{.underline}.44 [Deterrence credibility
is a function of an adversary's assessment of a **nation's military
capability** and political resolve]{.underline}. For deterrence to be
credible, an adversary has to believe that the United States has both
the military capability and the political willpower to carry out its
announced objectives.45 Of all the concepts and theories associated with
deterrence, the issue of how to demonstrate or signal credibility has
been the dominant theme in academic and policy literature. [Whereas in
the nuclear context discussions about deterrence credibility have
centered on political willpower and resolve,]{.underline} **[in
conventional deterrence the issue of credibility has focused on the
military capabilities]{.underline}** [component of the
credibility]{.underline} [equation]{.underline}. [The almost exclusive
emphasis on]{.underline} resolve for credible nuclear deterrence and on
[capabilities for credible conventional deterrence is the result of the
inherent differences between nuclear and conventional
weapons.]{.underline} There is little doubt that nuclear weapons are
extremely destructive. [The pertinent question for credible nuclear
deterrence is not whether one can inflict significant costs for unwanted
actions (assuming, of course, that the nuclear forces are survivable and
there are appropriate command, control, and communications), but rather
whether one will use nuclear weapons, since the execution of the threat
might risk retaliation in kind]{.underline}. As Herman Kahn argued, in
the nuclear are-na "[credibility depends on being willing to accept the
other side's retaliatory blow. It depends on the harm he can do, not the
harm we can do."]{.underline}46 In the conventional setting, it has been
advocated that the situation is essentially reversed. Given the
comparatively limited power of conventional weapons, an adversary may
doubt whether conventional forces are capable of denying a rapid victory
or inflicting the associated costs that outweigh the benefits of
aggression. As Richard Harknett explains: The nature of conventional
forces invites skepticism at a level that few deterrence theorists have
emphasized---that of capability. Due to the contestable nature of
conventional forces[, it is a state's capability to inflict costs that
is most likely to be questioned by a challenger]{.underline}. In a
conventional environment, [the issue of credibility is dominated by
suspicions about the capability to inflict costs rather than on the
decision to inflict costs]{.underline} . . . . [In the end, a state
evaluating a conventional deterrent can assume that the deterrer will
retaliate. The pertinent question is how costly that response will
be]{.underline}.47

### Arms Embargos = Prolif 

#### Arms embargos encourage proliferation -- especially in the context of conventionally weak countries

Conventional Arms Transfers to Prevent Nuclear Proliferation, Yale
University, Ann Arbor, 2012. ProQuest,

Having described both the technological limitations as well as the
strategic considerations for choosing a nuclear strategy over a
conventional one, the first way that U.S. arms transfers can influence
nuclear proliferation is by changing the military capabilities of the
arms recipient country. The simpler case to consider is limiting arms
sales. **[Arms embargoes can encourage nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}**. For conventionally weaker countries,
[decreasing military sales not only technologically restricts their
conventional capabilities,]{.underline} [but also heightens their
insecurity by tilting the balance of power in favor of their
adversaries]{.underline}. **[To countries that suffer a graver security
threat and an even less feasible conventional deterrence
option]{.underline}**, [developing nuclear weapons becomes more
attractive.]{.underline} Short of proclaiming neutrality, ending
hostilities, or seeking alliances, [acquiring nuclear bombs is one of
the most appealing strategic choice]{.underline} **[left for any country
that wishes to rely on its own efforts to compete militarily with its
adversaries]{.underline}**.73 Arms embargoes, however, may only have a
smaller effect on encouraging nuclear proliferation in conventionally
stronger countries. [Arms embargoes undercut the military advantage
countries with stronger military capabilities enjoy]{.underline}. While
the decrease in military capability could encourage proliferation, these
countries may still possess sufficient capabilities to deter
adversaries. Since conventionally strong countries have more to lose by
nuclear proliferation, these countries may still prefer to maintain
their conventional military advantage instead of embarking on continuing
risky nuclear weapons programs that threaten their conventional arms
supply and are not guaranteed to succeed. Nevertheless, **[one should
still observe a general trend that is captured in the first hypothesis
below.]{.underline}** Hypothesis 1: **[Arms embargoes generally
encourage nuclear proliferation]{.underline}**. In contrast to arms
embargoes, [the effect of conventional arms sales on nuclear
proliferation is more complex]{.underline} [and depends on the original
balance of power as well as military investment by the
adversary.]{.underline} Providing arms to countries with conventional
superiority discourages nuclear proliferation by maintaining the low
incentives countries have to seek nuclear weapons. [Developing nuclear
weapons can start a nuclear arms race that can level the strategic
playing field and destroy the stronger country\'s original conventional
military advantage. Israel]{.underline}, for instance, [fears starting a
nuclear arms race in the Middle East that would cripple its current
qualitative conventional superiority]{.underline}. **[This fear is a
reason that Israel remains ambiguous about its nuclear
capabilities]{.underline}**.74 \' 75 **[For countries conventionally
weak]{.underline}**, **[arms imports may discourage proliferation by
tilting the conventional balance of power]{.underline}**, [reversing
situations of insecurity.]{.underline} The Czech-Egyptian arms deal of
1955 had the potential to triple Egyptian military capacity if all the
Soviet equipment were adequately absorbed.76 Similarly, the 2010 \$60
billion US-Saudi Arabia arms deal will allow Saudi Arabia to establish
air superiority against all neighboring states except Israel.77

### Arms Sales Deter Terrorism 

#### US influence is key to indirect deterrence -- solves terror

Most of the major ideas for how to apply deterrence to terrorism
appeared fairly soon after 9/11. A short book published in 2002 by Paul
Davis and Brian Jenkins of RAND has been especially influential. Their
key insight involved the value of disaggregating a terrorist network
into its component elements. Although the suicide terrorist who has
hijacked an airplane is almost certainly beyond the reach of deterrence,
other actors involved in the terrorist enterprise might not be. As Davis
and Jenkins put it: It [is a mistake to think of influencing al Qaeda as
though it were a single]{.underline} [entity]{.underline}; rather,
**[the targets of US influence are the many elements of the al Qaeda
system]{.underline}**, which comprises leaders, lieutenants, financiers,
logisticians and other facilitators, foot soldiers, recruiters,
supporting population segments, and religious or otherwise ideological
figures[. A particular leader may not be easily deterrable, but other
elements]{.underline} of the system (e.g[., state supporters or wealthy
financiers living the good life while supporting al Qaeda in the
shadows]{.underline}) [may be]{.underline}.45 Thinking of al Qaeda as a
system opens the door to deterrence by punishment. The various
supporters and enablers of terrorism who are not themselves eager to
sacrifice their own lives for the cause can be threatened with
retaliation for their role in facilitating terrorist operations. The
threatened response need not be lethal, but could, depending on the
actor, involve financial sanctions or imprisonment. This approach is
good example of what Alexander George has described as 'indirect
deterrence'.46 Traditionally, deterrent threats have been aimed directly
at a potential attacker. [Indirect deterrence]{.underline}, in contrast,
[is not aimed at attackers themselves]{.underline}, **[but at third
parties whose actions could affect the likelihood that a potential
attacker can or will carry out an attack]{.underline}**. The likely need
to pursue an indirect approach was a major theme in a study conducted
for the National Academy of Sciences soon after 9/11 and has been echoed
in much of the subsequent research.47 In sum, **[there is broad
agreement that threats to punish state sponsors of terrorism and private
enablers]{.underline}**, such as financiers, might help prevent
terrorism not by directly deterring the terrorists themselves but by
deterring these other parties from providing support terrorists need to
carry out their operations. The indirect approach has an important
implication. [Just because a terrorist organization is a non-state actor
does not mean that states are irrelevant. If a terrorist group relies
upon or benefits from state assistance]{.underline}, then **[the state
can be threatened with consequences if it does not cease providing
support]{.underline}**. Wyn Bowen has pointed out that threats to take
action against state sponsors may be more a matter of compellence than
deterrence.48 If a state is already supporting a terrorist group, the
purpose of the threat is to get it to stop an activity already underway
rather than to prevent initiation of that activity (and the same point
applies to private supporters as well). Since the conventional wisdom
holds that compellence is harder than deterrence, Bowen cautions that it
may be difficult to successfully coerce state sponsors to abandon their
support -- though this does not lead him to recommend against trying[.
Even failed compellence]{.underline}, however, as in the effort after
9/11 to coerce the Taliban to turn over Osama bin Laden, [can have
deterrent benefits if there is appropriate follow-up.]{.underline} In
such cases, most of the literature points out, **[effective action to
remove an offending regime from power can exercise a deterrent effect on
other states]{.underline}**.49 [For efforts to deter other non-state
actors in the future,]{.underline} rather than state sponsors, [the fate
of al Qaeda is more relevant.]{.underline} Colby thus concludes,
'deterrence requires that the United States take every step to destroy
al Qaeda in order for our deterrent against terrorists to be
credible'.50 The goal of destroying al Qaeda creates complications
because, as Davis and Jenkins put it, 'deterrence and eradication do not
fit together easily'.51 The US intention to go after al Qaeda whether or
not it launches further attacks means there can be no US promise to let
the organization survive if it refrains from future terrorism. Without
such an assurance, using deterrence by punishment against al Qaeda as
whole is nearly impossible.52 As noted above, though, **[threats of
punishment might still work with elements of the network that enables
Qaeda terrorism]{.underline}**. It is important to recognize that [this
will make assurances necessary]{.underline}. [To threaten]{.underline}
[private financiers or state sponsors with punishment]{.underline} if
they support terrorism also [requires promising to leave them be if they
desist from aiding al Qaeda]{.underline}. This insight is the basis for
a proposal that in effect applies indirect deterrence to terrorist
organizations as well. Trager and Zagorcheva focus on deterring
terrorist groups that are not affiliated with al Qaeda from allying with
bin Laden's group.53 Some groups that have similar ideologies can still
be more concerned with local political struggles than with al Qaeda's
global jihad. If so, Trager and Zagorcheva argue, their local goals can
be held at risk. [If the United States is willing to indicate that it
will not act against local groups as long as they do not assist al
Qaeda, it could deter them from doing so by threatening to intervene to
block them from achieving their local political goals if they do assist
al Qaeda.]{.underline} Trager and Zagorcheva's proposal is a logical
extension of the indirect deterrence approach. [Instead of focusing on
deterring elements of the existing network]{.underline}, however, [it
seeks to prevent al Qaeda from expanding its network]{.underline}.
Trager and Zagorcheva thus do not deal with how to deter al Qaeda
itself, but their analysis does have an important policy implication. It
suggests President Bush made a mistake to declare a global war on
terror. By suggesting the United States would go on the offensive
against all terrorist groups, it gave them an incentive to join together
as allies facing a common threat. Trager and Zagorcheva also support
their analysis with a case study of contrasting approaches utilized
against two different insurgencies in the Philippines. This makes their
article almost unique among fourth-wave studies in actually testing its
ideas against empirical evidence.

Recent research on deterring rogue states has its roots in earlier Cold
War debates, which is not surprising given that past research focused on
deterring states. In contrast, the issue of deterring terrorism received
only sporadic attention during the Cold War. After September 11, many
observers dismissed the applicability of deterrence to non-state actors.
They pointed to the difficulties of finding effective threats both
against individual terrorists, who may care more about heavenly than
earthly rewards and are willing to commit suicide for their cause, and
against terrorist organizations that 'lack a return address' against
which to retaliate. These same challenges spurred others to look for
ways around the obstacles to utilizing deterrence. Ironically, the very
fact that the prospects for deterring terrorism appear so daunting has
produced a greater degree of consensus in this area. Most research has
been concerned simply with identifying ways to gain some leverage from
this strategy. Although there are still areas of debate, [a fair amount
of consensus has emerged on the basic approaches that make
sense]{.underline}. **[Three possible approaches to deterring terrorism
have received the most attention.]{.underline}** First, [many of
proposed approaches to deterrence are indirect in nature]{.underline},
[intended to pressure third parties]{.underline} **[who facilitate
terrorism]{.underline}** [rather than terrorist operatives
themselves]{.underline}. Second, this research shows renewed
appreciation for Glenn Snyder's concept of '[deterrence by
denial']{.underline}.44 In contrast to deterrence by punishment, which
threatens to inflict costs through retaliation after an attack,
denia**[l strategies aim to dissuade a potential attacker by convincing
them that the effort will not succeed]{.underline}** [and they will be
denied the benefits they hope to obtain. The third and most novel
approach involves challenging terrorists' justifications for
violence,]{.underline} an approach that has been labelled both
deterrence by counter-narrative and by delegitimization. Consistent with
the broader trend identified here, **[all three approaches rely at least
partly on sources of deterrence that are not only non-nuclear but
non-military in nature]{.underline}**. One other point of consensus is
also worth reiterating. [Despite widespread public doubts that terrorism
can be **deterred, studies on deterring terrorism argue unanimously that
it is possible**]{.underline}, though not necessarily easy. There is
also one significant area of disagreement, involving whether it makes
sense to threaten retaliation against the communities that terrorists
claim to represent.

[At the end of the Second World War, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [possessed almost half the world's manufacturing
capacity]{.underline}, the majority of its food supplies, nearly all of
its capital reserves and a military power unparalleled in human history.
In this context, [the US national interest became globalized as America
set about using its hegemonic leadership to fashion a new world
order.]{.underline} Whereas closed economic blocs had exacerbated the
rise of nationalist extremism after the First World War, [after 1945
American foreign policy elites sought to use the new US hegemony to
create **an international order** based on economic **interdependence**,
a conditional and institutionally bound **multilateralism** and
**strategic alliance networks**]{.underline} [under US
leadership]{.underline}. These networks existed in part to contain
Soviet expansionism militarily, but also to dampen geopolitical
competition from other centres of world power such as Japan or western
Europe.14 The promotion of the LIO thus represented the institutional
instantiation of the kind of world order that would allow the United
States to thrive while also remaining first among equals in a Pax
Americana.15 This order, while allowing the United States to flourish,
also carried substantial costs, with the emergence of economic
challenges from other states. Both Germany and Japan, formerly locked
into an existential struggle for world mastery, emerged as economic
challengers to the United States a little over three decades after the
cessation of hostilities. This was, then, a remarkably benign form of
hegemony, giving rise to the question: [why would the United States
choose this form of hegemonic leadership, and the often steep
concomitant costs in blood and treasure, to maintain a system that, in
economic terms at least, allowed other centres of power to emerge? At
this point we can usefully turn to IR theory, and in particular
hegemonic stability theory (HST),]{.underline} which can help us to
understand the structural logic underpinning hegemonic leadership.
Broadly speaking, [HST argues that the international system is more
likely to be stable when a single state is the dominant power within
that system. The existence of a hegemon helps eliminate collective
action problems associated with the generation of often costly global
public goods necessary to world commerce and to the underwriting of the
political and strategic contexts of global economic
interdependence]{.underline}---problems that have long bedevilled
international politics. Aside from the alleged efficacy of world
hegemonic leadership, [what does HST tell us about why a preponderant
power]{.underline} would seek this often costly role of global
leadership? The [first explanation is]{.underline} most closely
associated with Kindleberger, and argues that [a hegemon provides
leadership as a form of benevolent service to the international
community]{.underline}.16 In this sense, **[the hegemon seeks to
promote]{.underline}** [not only its own interests but also the
collective interests of the states that it leads: a form of noblesse
oblige]{.underline}. [In so far as hegemonic leadership is 'thought of
as the provision of the public good of responsibility]{.underline},
rather than exploitation of followers or the private good of prestige,
it remains a positive idea'. Importantly, hegemonic leadership can help
to pacify forms of economic rivalry inherent within the global economy.
That is, leadership can help 'pool sovereignties to limit the capacity
of separate countries to work against the general interest; such pooling
is virtually attained today in some of the functions needed to stabilize
the world economic system' and is 'necessary in the absence of delegated
authority'.17 [The hegemon is benign as its **net resource transfers to
the rest of the international community through the costs of the public
goods it supplies, including security public goods in the form of
alliance networks such as NATO,**]{.underline} are extremely costly.
This implies that the United States is not predominantly seeking either
its own immediate advantage or its own one-sided long-term strength
vis-à-vis other economic centres. Instead, it is promoting change in the
collective interests of world prosperity through the exercise of a
benign hegemony. Proponents of this explanation of US global leadership
would tend to view the various deviations from multilateralism as being
both secondary and generated by domestic protectionist and mercantilist
lobbies using their domestic political power to undercut a multilateral
mainstream to some extent on some issues at various times. The image of
American external economic policy as being predominantly multilateral
since 1945 rests above all on two indicators: levels of protectionism in
the field of goods and services, and levels of America's international
economic integration, in particular the growth of the share of imports
as a percentage of GDP. On both these indicators, American policy since
1945 would seem to have broadly favoured economic multilateralism: both
tariff and non-tariff barriers, historically high in the United States
throughout the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth in
the industrial field, were dramatically reduced after 1945, since when
the American economy has become progressively more integrated into the
world economy, its trade rising rapidly as a percentage of GDP. The case
for this multilateral image is especially strong for the quarter of a
century after 1945, paradoxically because Washington did not, at that
time, use its enormous power resources to force open the markets of the
rest of the world as a strategy of economic nationalism would have
suggested, given the economic ascendancy of American business at that
time.18 Instead, Washington scaled back its earlier plans for a
radically open postwar world economy and gave priority to the economic
revival of both western Europe and Japan: a necessary step in helping to
support the 'rump' of the LIO in the Cold War context of bipolarity,
while encouraging a gradual winding down of European colonialism lest
too rapid a withdrawal create geopolitical vacuums. It is this form of
relatively benign leadership that informs the historical narrative of
liberal internationalists.19 [A second image is that of the coercive
hegemon]{.underline}. In contrast to Kindleberger's benign hegemon,
Gilpin's hegemon provides public goods but is far less tolerant of
states attempting to free-ride.20 [This hegemon helps to sustain the
international order not out of benevolence but out of self-interest, and
is quite willing to coerce free-riders into paying to help fund its
hegemony.]{.underline} In this version there is no Kindleberger-style
transfer of resources from the hegemon to the international community as
a whole, and provision of public goods is resource-neutral for the
hegemon as long as other states are either willing to pay for them or
can be coerced into doing so. [All other things being equal, this ought
to be good for hegemonic longevity. However, using coercion to cover the
costs of supplying public goods may create problems for the hegemon in
another area,]{.underline} namely that of legitimacy: according to both
liberal internationalist and constructivist theorists, consensual
regimes help prolong the longevity of the order itself, as other states
have 'voice opportunities' to help shape the order.21 That is, there is
a trade-off between coercion and legitimacy. As amply demonstrated in
the US-led 'war on terror' after 2001, coercive hegemony, even in the
context of military unipolarity, can only get you so far, as allied
states need to reconcile the demands of the hegemon with their own
domestic publics. Push too hard, and it is very likely that both soft
and hard balancing dynamics begin to develop, or that one's democratic
allies are punished by their respective hostile publics.22 [From this
perspective, an American commitment to multilateralism, rather than
being benign, is in fact a ruse for promoting free trade in fields where
American businesses lead; what we might term an 'informal
empire]{.underline}', [where free trade makes sense because of the sheer
economic preponderance of the hegemon's domestic
businesses.]{.underline}23 Leading structural realists have revived the
ideas of William Appleman Williams, who in the mid-twentieth century
outlined an economically expansionist dynamic in American foreign policy
and the drive for what he called an 'Open Door world'.24 On this
reading, the language of liberal free trade has supplied a legitimizing
discourse for a strategy devoted to opening the markets of others to
American business interests. Proponents of this coercive mercantilist
image also argue that the liberal characteristics of the international
trade regime which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s were a reflection not
of a strategic commitment to multilateralism on the part of American
leaders but instead of their confidence in the competitive ascendancy of
American industry. Accordingly, when that ascendancy faced challenges in
the 1970s, American economic strategy turned against liberal
internationalist principles. The most obvious example of this was the
abandonment of the gold-linked international monetary regime after
August 1972, when the Nixon administration closed the 'gold window'.25
Within the Bretton Woods system the dollar was the key unit of account,
at a fixed, though in principle adjustable, exchange rate to gold. This
system required the American Treasury to adjust American macroeconomic
policy to ensure the stability of the dollar against gold. By breaking
the link with gold, Washington signalled its refusal to allow American
national economic policy to be constrained in this way, thus
subordinating the stability of international monetary relations to
purely American national interests (this point is examined in more
detail below). [The third image, that of the structurally advantaged
hegemon, is the one that I argue best captures the nature of US
hegemony.]{.underline}26 [Here, leadership gives the hegemon the
capacity **to shape world order in ways that confer upon it advantages**
that will enable it not only to recover the costs of supplying public
goods, but to accrue other positional advantages.]{.underline} That is,
[the hegemon acquires the benefits of cooperation **without having to
resort to coercion, while reinforcing its position by extracting
resources** from the rest of the international community and
**reinvesting them in ways that help prolong its
hegemony.**]{.underline} Moreover, [the hegemon can do this as other
states accept the hegemon's overall international order as
**legitimate**]{.underline}, [at least for as long as the opportunity
costs of major systemic revision outweigh the costs of staying with the
status quo. The hegemon is therefore in the position of enjoying
resource inflows from the rest of the international community. In this
sense, the United States is thus both a 'system maker' and a 'privilege
taker', and accrues advantages through structuring world order in ways
that benefit its interests while **delivering enough benefits to other
states to discourage them from seeking to revise the US-led
order**]{.underline}.27 What, then, are some of the key positional
advantages that the US enjoys?

[As]{.underline} still [the world's sole superpower, the United States
possesses an unequaled array of instruments to support its foreign and
defense strategies. With so much attention being focused]{.underline} on
the [conflicts in the Middle East, Russian aggression]{.underline} in
Eastern Europe [and Chinese efforts to assert its hegemony]{.underline}
in the Western Pacific, [the fact that the United States employs a wide
range of non-military, or at least non-kinetic tools in pursuing its
national interests is lost.]{.underline} Most recently, for example, the
United States and China agreed on the imposition of new trade sanctions
on North Korea in response to that country's test of a long-range
ballistic missile. [One of the most important of these tools is foreign
military sales (FMS). The complex role of FMS is reflected]{.underline},
in part, [in the fact that the program is run by the Department of State
and not the Department of Defense.]{.underline} [One reason for this
unusual management approach is that the FMS program involves sales by
the U.S. government of U.S. arms, defense equipment, defense services,
and military training to foreign governments]{.underline}. As a result,
[such sales reflect the views of the **U.S. government with respect** to
the recipient country,]{.underline} [its relationships with others in
the region and the overall approach this country takes to **mitigating
the threat of regional or global conflict.**]{.underline} The FMS
program serves many other purposes. [The sales of U.S. arms and related
items to foreign countries helps reduce the cost of those systems to our
own military]{.underline}. [FMS sales help to ensure the ability of U.S.
allies to defend themselves and support the maintenance of **stable
regional military balances.**]{.underline} Equally [important, FMS sales
over time establish enduring relationships between foreign governments
and their militaries and the U.S. When the U.S. military trains
alongside **those of allies equipped with the same hardware**, it helps
to **cement the bonds** between our countries. Moreover, it improves
communications and understanding among these militaries, often helping
to inculcate U.S. values related to the use of military force. Foreign
militaries dependent on access to U.S. hardware, spare parts, software
upgrades and training are more likely to listen to this country when
there is a dispute regarding regional politics or defense issues. FMS
has been particularly important as an instrument for influencing foreign
governments and shaping regional balances of power in the Middle
East]{.underline}. Following the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, the United
States completely reequipped the Egyptian military. [The
Egyptian-Israeli border has been remarkably stable ever since. Sales of
military aircraft, missile defense systems and precision munitions to
the nations of the Persian Gulf have been instrumental in ensuring a
stable balance of forces in that area.]{.underline}

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? [Taken **literally**, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe]{.underline}. [This suggests a rather low threshold]{.underline}
for what counts as a global catastrophe. An event causing just one death
on each continent (say, from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a
global catastrophe, because surely these deaths would be catastrophic
for the deceased and their loved ones. [However, in common usage, a
global catastrophe would be **catastrophic** for a significant portion
of the globe]{.underline}. Minimum thresholds have variously been set
around ten thousand to ten million deaths or \$10 billion to \$10
trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković 2008), or death of one quarter
of the human population (Atkinson 1999; Hempsell 2004). [Others have
emphasized catastrophes that cause **long-term declines in the
trajectory of human civilization**]{.underline} (Beckstead 2013), [that
human civilization **does not recover from**]{.underline} (Maher and
Baum 2013), [that drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline} ([Bostrom]{.underline} 2002, [using the term
"**existential risk**"), or that result in **human
extinction**]{.underline} (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). [A common theme
across all these treatments of GCR is that **some catastrophes are
vastly more important than others**]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was perhaps
the first to recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan
1983). [Without nuclear winter, a global nuclear war might kill several
hundred million people. This is obviously a major catastrophe, but
humanity would presumably carry on. However, with **nuclear
winter**]{.underline}, per Sagan, [**humanity could go extinct**. The
loss would be not just an additional four billion or so deaths, but the
loss of **all future generations**]{.underline}. To paraphrase Sagan,
[the loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
**more**]{.underline}. [Sagan estimated **500 trillion lives**, assuming
humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he cited as
typical for a successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number may even
be an **underestimate**]{.underline}. The analysis here takes an
adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the human species and the
long-term fate of the universe. On these long time scales, the
descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be recognizably
"human". The issue then is whether the descendants are still worth
caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs the question
of how many of them there will be. Barring major global catastrophe,
Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more years 2 until the
Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar System, Milky Way
galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse will remain
habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin 1997), should
our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. [An open question in
astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants of humanity to
continue living for an **infinite length of time** or instead merely an
**astronomically large but finite** length of time]{.underline} (see
e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, [the stakes with global
catastrophes **could** be **much larger than the loss of 500 trillion
lives.** Debates about the infinite vs. the merely astronomical are of
theoretical interest]{.underline} (Ng 1991; Bossert et al. 2007), [but
they have **limited practical significance**. This can be seen when
**evaluating GCRs from a standard
risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude framework**. Using Sagan's 500
trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the probability of
global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance is of the same
significance as saving one human life. Phrased differently, society
should **try 500 trillion times harder to prevent a global catastrophe
than it should to save a person's life**. Or, preventing one million
deaths is equivalent to a one-in500-million reduction in the probability
of global catastrophe. This suggests society should **make extremely
large investment in GCR reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives.**]{.underline} Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a
similar point in monetary terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as
the value of a statistical human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the
total loss of life (double the 2004 world population); he describes both
figures as significant underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600
trillion as an underestimate of the value of preventing global
catastrophe. For comparison, the United States government typically uses
a VSL of around one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying
a \$10 million VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value
of preventing global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion,
[society should be willing to spend]{.underline} at least that much to
prevent a global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend
at least [\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the
probability of global catastrophe]{.underline}. Thus [while reasonable
disagreement exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much to count
future generations, even low-end positions suggest **vast resource
allocations** should be redirected to reducing GCR. This conclusion is
only **strengthened** when considering the **astronomical size of the
stakes**]{.underline}, but the same point holds either way. The bottom
line is that, [as long as something along the lines of the standard
riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used, then
**even tiny GCR reductions** merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
**permanent harm to global human civilization**. The discussion thus far
has assumed that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is
**not universally held**]{.underline}. [People often value some people
more than others]{.underline}, favoring themselves, their family and
friends, their compatriots, their generation, or others whom they
identify with. [Great debates rage on across moral philosophy,
economics, and other fields about how much people should value
others]{.underline} who are distant in space, time, or social relation,
as well as the unborn members of future generations. [This debate is
crucial]{.underline} for all valuations of risk, including GCR. Indeed,
if each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then global
catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably have
better things to do with our time than worry about them. [While everyone
has the right to their **own views and feelings**]{.underline}, we find
that [the strongest arguments are for the **widely held position** that
**all human lives should be valued equally**.]{.underline} This position
is succinctly stated in the United States Declaration of Independence,
updated in the 1848 Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold these truths to
be self-evident: that all men and 3 women are created equal".
[Philosophers speak of an agent-neutral, objective "view from
nowhere"]{.underline} (Nagel 1986) [or a "veil of
ignorance"]{.underline} (Rawls 1971) [in which each person considers
what is best for society **irrespective of which member of society they
happen to be**]{.underline}. [Such a perspective **suggests valuing
everyone equally**, regardless of who they are or where or when they
live. This in turn suggests a **very high value for reducing GCR**, or a
high degree of priority for GCR reduction efforts.]{.underline} 3.
Challenges To Analyzing GCR Given the goal of reducing GCR, one must
know what the risks are and how they can be reduced. This requires
diving into the details of the risks themselves---details that we
largely skip in this paper---but it also requires attention to a few
analytical challenges. The first challenge is the largely unprecedented
nature of global catastrophes. Simply put, modern human civilization has
never before ended. There have been several recent global catastrophes
of some significance, the World Wars and the 1918 flu among them, but
these clearly did not knock civilization out. Earlier catastrophes,
including the prehistoric mass extinction events, the Toba volcanic
eruption, and even the Black Death plague, all occurred before modern
civilization existed. The GCR analyst is thus left to study risks of
events that are in some way untested or unproven. But [the lack of
historical precedent does not necessarily imply a lack of ongoing
risk.]{.underline} Indeed, [the biggest mistake of **naïve** GCR
analysis is to posit that, because no global catastrophe has previously
occurred, therefore none will occur. This mistake comes in at least
three forms.]{.underline} The first and most obviously false form is to
claim that unprecedented events never occur. In our world of social and
technological innovation, it is easy to see that this claim is false.
But accounting for it in risk analysis still requires some care. One
approach is to use what is known in probability theory as zero-failure
data (Hanley 1983; Bailey 1997; Quigley and Revie 2011). Suppose that no
catastrophe has occurred over n prior time periods---for example, there
has been no nuclear war in the 65 years since two countries have had
nuclear weapons. (The second country to build nuclear weapons was the
Soviet Union, in 1949.) It can thus be said that there have been zero
failures of nuclear deterrence in 65 cases. An approximate upper bound
can then be estimated for the probability p of nuclear deterrence
failure, i.e. the probability of nuclear war, occurring within an
upcoming year. Specifically, p lies within the interval \[0, u\] with (1
-- α) confidence, where u = 1 -- α(1/n) gives the upper limit of the
confidence interval. Thus for 95% confidence (α = 0.05), u =
1-0.05(1/65) = 0.05, meaning that there is a 95% chance that the
probability of nuclear war within an upcoming year is somewhere between
0 and 0.05. Note that this calculation assumes (perhaps erroneously)
that the 65 non-failures are independent random trials and that p is
approximately constant over time, but it nonetheless provides a starting
point for estimating the probability of unprecedented events. Barrett et
al. (2013) uses a similar approach as part of a validation check of a
broader risk analysis of U.S.-Russia nuclear war. The second form of the
mistake is to posit that the ongoing existence of human civilization
proves that global catastrophes will not occur. It is true that
civilization's continued existence despite some past threats should
provide some comfort, but it should only provide some comfort. Consider
this: if a global catastrophe had previously occurred, nobody would
still be around to ponder the matter (at least for catastrophes causing
human extinction). The fact of being able to observe one's continued
survival is contingent upon having survived. While it is easy to see
that this is a mistake, it is harder to correct for it. Again, it
requires careful application of probability theory, correcting for what
is known as an observation selection effect (Bostrom 2002b, Ćirković 4
et al. 2010). The basic idea is to build the existence of the observer
into probability estimates for catastrophes that would eliminate future
observers. The result is probability estimates unbiased by the
observer's existence, with global catastrophe probability estimates
typically revised upwards. The third form of the mistake is to posit
that, because humanity has survived previous catastrophes, or risks of
catastrophes, therefore it will survive future ones. This mistake is
especially pervasive in discussions of nuclear war. [People sometimes
observe that no nuclear war has ever occurred and cite this as evidence
to conclude that therefore nuclear deterrence and the fear of mutually
assured destruction will **indefinitely continue to keep the world
safe**]{.underline} (for discussion see Sagan and Waltz 2013). [But
there have been several **near misses**]{.underline}, [from the 1962
Cuban missile crisis to the 1995 Norwegian rocket incident, and there is
no guarantee that nuclear war will be avoided into the distant future.
Similarly, **just because no pandemic** has ever killed the majority of
people]{.underline} (Black Death killed about 22%), [or just because
early predictions about the rise of **artificial intelligence** proved
false]{.underline} (they expected human-level AI within decades that
have long since come and gone; see Crevier 1993; McCorduck 2004), [it
**does not necessarily follow that no pandemics would be so lethal**, or
that AI cannot reach the lofty heights of the early predictions.
**Careful risk analysis**]{.underline} [can correct]{.underline} for the
third form [by looking at the **full sequences of events** that would
lead to particular global catastrophes]{.underline}. For example,
[nuclear weapons in the United States are launched following a sequence
of decisions]{.underline} by increasingly high ranking officials,
ultimately including the President. [This]{.underline} decision sequence
[can be **built into a risk model**]{.underline}, [with model parameters
**estimated** from **historical data** on how often each step in the
decision sequence has been reached]{.underline} (Barrett et al. 2013).
[The more often near misses have occurred, and the nearer the misses
were, the **higher the probability of an eventual "hit" in the form of a
nuclear war**. The same analytic structure can be applied to **other
GCRs**.]{.underline}

The defense strategy articulated in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review
(QDR) places a great deal of emphasis on enhancing the relationships
between the United States and its friends and allies. **[Building the
security capacity of partner states is identified as a key U.S. defense
objective]{.underline}**. [This objective primarily focuses on states
facing the threat of insurgency]{.underline}, [terrorism and/or internal
instability**. The QDR also recognizes the importance of allies in
deterring regional conflicts and even nuclear wars**]{.underline}. The
document proposes to use what are called "new, tailored, regional
deterrence architectures" to reinforce U.S. commitments to major friends
and allies in Europe, the Middle East and East Asia. [For more than
fifty years, **the United States has used international arms sales to
reinforce its commitments to friends and allies,**]{.underline} [build
their self defense capacities and enhance regional
deterrence]{.underline}. When countries acquire U.S. equipment [there
are increased opportunities for collaboration on everything from
training and education to maintenance and support]{.underline}.
Obviously, [**such sales also help America's balance of payments and
provide for highly-skilled, well-paying jobs in the United States.** One
example of the power of U.S. international arms sales is the F-16
program]{.underline}. With around 4,000 aircraft produced, this is the
single largest military aircraft program in history. The 25 countries
that fly the F-16 reflect the full array of U.S. global relationships:
Bahrain, Belgium, Chile, Denmark, Egypt, Greece, Jordan, Indonesia,
Israel, Italy, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland,
Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. During the Cold War, [the fleets of
F-16s]{.underline} deployed by allies in Europe and Northeast Asia
**[helped to deter the Soviet Union]{.underline}**. [Recent sales of
advanced F-16 variants are helping to keep the peace and augment the
deployment of U.S. airpower overseas. **International arms sales can
enhance regional stability**]{.underline}. The United States provided
the means to completely re-equip the Egyptian military in the aftermath
of the peace treaty between that country and Israel. Sales to Saudi
Arabia and the sates of the Persian Gulf helped to offset the military
threats posed, first by Iraq, and now by Iran. [The sale of conventional
arms is one tool by which the United States has sought to counter the
temptation that some states might have to pursue weapons of mass
destruction. International sales of the next generation of U.S. weapon
systems have the clear potential to enhance the security of friends and
allies and support a number of U.S. security objectives]{.underline}.
The F-35 consortium[,]{.underline} consisting of Great Britain, Italy,
the Netherlands, Turkey, Canada, Australia, Denmark and Norway, is the
most far-reaching international arms cooperation arrangement ever. Over
the next several decades, sales of the F-35 could exceed those of the
F-16. [U.S. allies have acquired the C-17 to fill the capabilities gap
created by the long-delayed A400M.]{.underline} Systems such as the
Stryker combat vehicle, Littoral Combat Ship, and the V-22 tiltrotor
among others are likely to be very attractive to friends and allies.
U.S. plans for tailored regional deterrence architectures rests heavily
on foreign sales of such systems as a land-based variant of the Standard
Missile 3 and the Theater High Altitude Area Defense. The Obama
Administration needs to craft a comprehensive strategy for international
arms sales. As this country struggles to address a growing range of
security challenges and the need to bring its own budgetary house in
order, international sales of U.S. weapons systems could have an
increasingly important place in our national security strategy.

After Jan. 20, President Donald Trump will juggle a number of important
tensions with longstanding U.S. allies. For example, Trump's tweets
suggest rapprochement with Russia is a priority, yet NATO allies and the
U.S. Congress will press for support to NATO allies, such as those in
the Baltic region. In Asia, Trump has promised to take a strong line
against Chinese assertiveness, but has also questioned whether Japan and
South Korea are contributing enough to contain China. So Trump faces
this dilemma: [how can he reassure allies while engaging
adversaries]{.underline}? Our research suggests one possibility: **[arms
transfers.]{.underline}** In our recent International Security article,
we elaborate on the "patron's dilemma" that arises when relationships
with allies change. We explain the decades-old U.S. playbook, which
calls for the United States to signal reassurance and deterrence via
arms transfers, while improving ties with adversaries. Will Trump follow
this playbook? [**Arms transfers are particularly useful when
geostrategic priorities are shifting.** Here's why we think Trump will
use this foreign policy tool: Arms transfers]{.underline} accomplish two
important goals: [**upgrading local deterrent capabilities and
offsetting fears of abandonment**. Allies are better equipped to defend
themselves, thanks to U.S. weapons. Arms transfers typically don't
attract as much attention]{.underline} as U.S. military deployments or
new treaty commitments. **[But they can enable the recipient to engage
in aggressive foreign policies]{.underline}** that the United States
might not desire, especially if the arms transfers enable offensive
operations. [Experts call this worry "entrapment]{.underline}" --- when
an ally gets drawn into another country's conflict. [Arms transfers
signal a different form of commitment than alliances]{.underline}. After
all, [**treaty alliances tie hands by requiring allies to fight for one
another in any future conflict**. Such treaties are formalized security
ties]{.underline} --- and usually follow a politicized ratification
process. These "pieces of paper" are inflexible, but do not necessarily
require follow-up military investment. What sorts of arms transfers are
most likely? Two factors shape what combination of alliances and arms
the United States might offer its clients. [First, U.S. foreign
policymakers look at shared security interests when deciding whether to
form or maintain an alliance]{.underline}. To make this determination,
U.S[. policymakers typically ask whether the client state has a similar
or different ranking of security threats than that of the United
States.]{.underline} Here's an example. Both Western Europe and the
United States shared the view that the Soviet Union was the leading
threat to their vital interests after World War II, so they formed NATO.
If the threat rankings align, Washington seeks to establish or
strengthen an alliance. If the threat rankings differ, then U.S. foreign
policymakers find that avoiding or downgrading an alliance commitment
better serves U.S. interests. Indeed, that is why the Carter
administration scrapped the U.S. formal alliance with Taiwan to
normalize ties with China in 1978. \[Trump is risking war by turning the
One China question into a bargaining chip\] Second, [U.S. leaders decide
whether to arm the client]{.underline}. In making this decision,
[**policymakers ask whether the client can deter its adversary without
U.S. assistance**. If the local security balance favors an
adversary]{.underline}, [then transfers of U.S. weapons may be necessary
to bolster the client's security**.**]{.underline} If the local security
balance favors the ally, substantial arms transfers are unnecessary ---
and can even encourage entrapment by the client. Here's what this will
mean in practice --- more arms transfers So how might the next
administration approach the geopolitical conundrums associated with
adjusting U.S. alliances? If U.S. leaders seek rapprochement with
Russia, is there a quid pro quo? A close aide of Vladimir Putin has
already suggested that pulling back NATO forces from the Baltic region
would reassure Moscow that Washington seeks closer ties. Yet if Trump
obliges, then he might be under pressure from Congress and from NATO
allies to reassure Baltic countries that the United States will minimize
the risks of Russia exploiting any great power bargain. [To solidify the
U.S. long-term commitment, Washington might offer lethal defensive
weapons to boost Baltic ground and air defenses. **This move
would**]{.underline} then **[enhance local deterrence. Russia might have
no other choice than to accept this compromise]{.underline}** [if its
desire for rapprochement is sincere]{.underline}. For a precedent, look
no further than the recent Iran deal. Since the July 2015 Iran nuclear
deal, Saudi Arabia has received large amounts of U.S. weapons, including
an arms agreement worth \$1 billion, to attenuate its security concerns.
This scenario played out often after the normalization of relations with
China. Washington agreed to recognize Beijing as the official government
of China. Yet Washington often made major arms transfers like fighter
jets and surface-to-air missile systems to Taiwan to reassure Taipei
that the United States remained committed to Taiwan's ability to defend
itself against mainland China. Following Obama's footsteps? Unlike his
stance on Russia, Trump appears to favor a more hawkish approach toward
China, as evidence by his comments on the one-China policy. Yet Trump's
comments about burden-sharing by Japan and South Korea create a tension
because balancing against China would require strengthening --- not
weakening --- alliances with Japan and South Korea. History suggests
that **[more arms sales to Taiwan are possible because the cross-strait
military balance is worsening due to China's military
modernization]{.underline}**. [The Trump administration might feel it
necessary to make larger, more advanced, and more sustained arms
packages than those committed to by President Obama in
2015.]{.underline} Moreover, despite calls for greater alliance
burden-sharing by Japan and South Korea, the new Trump administration
might invest more in those alliances to maintain local military balances
against China and North Korea, respectively. In short, [the Trump
administration might end up relying on arms transfers as its chief tool
of reassurance and deterrence]{.underline} from Europe to Asia. [In
doing so, Trump would follow in the footsteps of the Obama
administration]{.underline}, which authorized more arms sales than any
U.S. administration since World War II. For alliance politics, arms
transfers might be the new art of the deal.

#### Maintaining US military support to foreign countries is key to expand geostrategic influence

**Montgomery 16** (Evan Braden Montgomery, \"Extended deterrence in the
second Nuclear Age.\" CSBA, Washington (2016): 24-26. Evan Braden
Montgomery is a Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments.) //bc

[Alliances]{.underline}---both formal and informal---[have long been a
source of competitive advantage for the United States**. Allies can
prevent hostile nations from extending their influence into
geostrategically important areas**, send their armed forces to support
the United States in overseas contingencies]{.underline}, [provide
access to facilities that allow Washington to project power]{.underline}
over vast distances, [defray the costs of the U.S. global military
presence, acquire useful intelligence that it might not be able to
obtain on its own, and enhance the legitimacy of U.S. foreign policy by
supporting its stance on key issues.]{.underline} 18 Of course,
alliances also have downsides. For instance, allies can free ride on the
United States by decreasing their own contributions to the common
defense, assuming that Washington will make up for any capability gaps
or capacity deficits. They can also entrap the United States in unwanted
conflicts if security guarantees embolden them to engage in provocative
behavior toward their rivals. Finally, they can impose significant
opportunity costs on U.S. policymakers, who often devote considerable
time and effort to assuring allies that they will not be left in the
lurch, even when the prospect of abandonment is extremely small.19 On
the whole, however, [policymakers have generally viewed alliances as a
net plus]{.underline}. Thus they have gone to great lengths to preserve
and even expand the alliance portfolio that, for the most part, was
assembled during the Cold War. [Yet not all U.S. alliances are
alike]{.underline}. Rather, they **[are structured in very different
ways]{.underline}**, [which has important implications for extended
nuclear deterrence.]{.underline} In Europe, for example, the United
States is committed to the protection of partner nations through its
membership (and leading role) in NATO: a multilateral alliance with an
integrated military command structure that was created more than sixty
years ago to enhance collective defense against a hostile Soviet Union.
According to Article V of the 1949 Washington Treaty that created NATO,
"The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all,"
which would require member states to provide each other with
assistance.20 This has always included the potential use of U.S. nuclear
weapons, particularly when Warsaw Pact conventional forces seemed to
enjoy significant advantages over their NATO counterparts. To bolster
this extended nuclear deterrent, NATO developed two important
mechanisms. First, the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG), along with its
subordinate groups, allows all interested alliance members to engage in
high-level discussions on nuclear issues and therefore gives those
members a voice in policies relating to the possible use of nuclear
weapons. Second, "dual-key" nuclear sharing arrangements allow select
alliance members to not only host U.S. nuclear weapons on their
territory, but also deliver some of those weapons themselves if the
United States determines that crossing the nuclear threshold is
necessary.21 Together, these mechanisms have dissuaded many (though not
all) allies from pursuing their own nuclear weapons by giving them a
better alternative; assured local nations that the United States would
fight on their behalf by providing them with more influence over
escalation dynamics; and deterred conflict by putting nuclear weapons
directly into the hands of those nations that would be the immediate
targets of aggression. Although the end of the Cold War seemingly
removed the main rationale for NATO's status as a "nuclear alliance,"
and although public and political sentiment in some member states has
been in favor of scaling back or even abandoning that status, the United
States continues to extend its nuclear umbrella over much of Europe.
Moreover, both the NPG and nuclear sharing arrangements remain in place.
As NATO's 2010 Strategic Concept declared, "Deterrence, based on an
appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional capabilities, remains a core
element of our overall strategy."22 By contrast[, U.S. alliances in the
Asia-Pacific differ in three important respects]{.underline}. First,
[rather than forming a single, multilateral alliance]{.underline} to
contain Soviet and Chinese expansion during the Cold War, **[Washington
generally opted for bilateral defense pacts with its local
partners]{.underline}**---[an approach that stemmed in large part from
lingering fears of entrapment during the 1950s]{.underline}.23 Second,
excluding the Republic of Korea (ROK) where the United States has been
responsible for wartime operational control over host nation forces,
[none of these pacts resulted in the development of integrated military
command structures]{.underline}.24 Third, [although Washington
previously stationed nuclear weapons on the territory of some allies in
the region, **these weapons remained in the sole custody of U.S.
forces**]{.underline}, and [no nuclear planning organizations or nuclear
sharing arrangements analogous to those found in NATO were ever
created.]{.underline}25 As in Europe, the [United States continues to
extend its nuclear deterrent to several nations in the
Asia-Pacific]{.underline}, namely Japan, South Korea, and Australia.26
For instance, [the]{.underline} most recent ["2+2" meeting between
Washington and Tokyo emphasized "the ironclad U.S. commitment to the
defense of Japan, through the full range of U.S. military capabilities,
including nuclear and conventional]{.underline}."27 Similarly, the
[joint communiqué]{.underline} produced by the latest United States and
South Korea Security Consultative Meeting "[reaffirmed the continued
U.S. commitment to provide and strengthen extended deterrence for the
ROK]{.underline} using the full range of military capabilities,
including the U.S. nuclear umbrella, conventional strike and missile
defense capabilities."28 And although the United States has not made
similar public declarations with regard to Australia, it is clear that
[Canberra also relies on American nuclear security
guarantees]{.underline}, particularly given the role that it plays in
supporting U.S. strategic nuclear forces by hosting joint early-warning
and communications facilities.29 Like both of these regions, [the Middle
East is also home to]{.underline} a number of security partners:
[nations that purchase U.S. arms, host U.S. facilities, train with U.S.
troops, and sometimes fight alongside them]{.underline} as well.
[Washington does not have defense pacts with any of these
countries,]{.underline} however, **[electing instead to cooperate more
informally]{.underline}**, although it has publically reaffirmed its
commitment to protect its partners on many occasions. Not surprisingly,
**[some of these relationships are as close as any treaty-based
alliance]{.underline}**. [The United States has long viewed the Middle
East as a critical region and has played a key role in preserving
stability there]{.underline}. Specifically, its strategy toward the area
since the 1970s has rested on three enduring pillars: [preserving the
security of Israel, maintaining close ties with friendly Arab nations,
and ensuring the free flow of resources]{.underline} [through the
Persian Gulf.]{.underline} Consequently, Washington has provided Israel
with considerable diplomatic, financial, and material assistance, to
include shielding it from pressure in international organizations,
supplying it with advanced weapons, supporting its development of new
military capabilities, and restocking its armed forces when they have
run short of supplies during past conflicts. [The United States has also
sustained a significant military presence in the region]{.underline},
with key facilities in Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and the United Arab
Emirates.30 Perhaps most important of all, it has come to the defense of
local nations under duress, especially during the late 1980s, when Iran
was menacing oil exports from the region, and throughout the 1990s, when
Iraq was a constant threat to its neighbors. Given that these security
commitments are informal, they do not have an obvious nuclear component.
However, the United States has previously engaged in nuclear
brinkmanship when a local partner was in danger---notably in 1973, when
the Nixon administration raised the alert level of U.S. nuclear forces
to deter Soviet intervention in the Yom Kippur War.31 Furthermore, ties
between the United States and some of its allies in the region are so
strong that it is impossible to rule out the notion of Washington
resorting to nuclear threats under certain conditions.

#### Arms sales are designed to expand US influence and facilitate US policy

**Kim 17** (Kim, Tongfi. \"Arms, Alliances, and Patron-Client
Relationships.\" International Security, vol. 42 no. 3, 2017, pp.
183-186. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/685694.) //bc

In \"To Arm or to Ally?\" Keren Yarhi-Milo, Alexander Lanoszka, and Zack
Cooper present an elegant and powerful theory that explains conditions
under which a great power (in their case, the United States) offers a
client state arms, an alliance commitment, or both.1 Their article does
not give due attention, however, to what motivates a patron to provide
security assistance to clients in the first place---especially its
desire to influence its clients to obtain concessions in military,
political, economic, and other policies.2 Below I explain how
Yarhi-Milo, Lanoszka, and Cooper\'s conceptualization of key variables
inadvertently plays down the role of influence-seeking in U.S. policy.
First, Yarhi-Milo, Lanoszka, and Cooper\'s conceptualization of arms
transfers does not reflect the wide range of ways in which a patron can
support a client and the significant differences among the types of arms
transfers with regard to buying influence. [Their conceptualization of
arms transfers]{.underline}, in which \"a state gives another state
weapons to augment its military capabilities\" (p. 95), \"[covers
multiple methods of provision, including sales, grants, and
loans\"]{.underline} (p. 97). As they discuss at the beginning of the
article, **[however, the United States spends large sums of money on
security assistance worldwide]{.underline}**, a [significant portion of
which is spent on things other than U.S. arms]{.underline} (p. 91).
[Israel]{.underline}, for example, [has been allowed by the U.S.
government to use about]{.underline} \[End Page 183\] [26 percent of its
U.S. Foreign Military Financing to purchase Israeli
weapons]{.underline}.3 [Pakistan]{.underline}, in addition to Foreign
Military Financing, [had received about \$13 billion]{.underline} by
2015 in Coalition Support Fund assistance [for \"operational and
logistical support of U.S.-led counterterrorism
operations.\"]{.underline}4 Because military aid other than arms
transfers can increase the military capabilities of clients, it deserves
analysis. At the same time, it is problematic not to differentiate
sales, grants, and loans in analyzing transactions between allies. For
instance, Japan has received more arms from the United States than
Israel, but letting Japan buy U.S. arms with Japanese money is much less
of a patron\'s favor to a client than giving Israel money to buy U.S.
arms.5 Second, Yarhi-Milo, Lanoszka, and Cooper define \"commonality of
security interests\" as \"the extent of the threat that the client\'s
primary adversary poses to the patron\'s core security interests\" (p.
98), but their definition neglects the importance of the patron and
client agreeing on how to deal with the adversary. For instance, in the
early years of the Cold War, South Korea\'s and Taiwan\'s adversaries
were also U.S. adversaries, but these clients\' preference for offensive
strategies posed significant problems for Washington. [The United
States,]{.underline} therefore, **[needed to exert influence on both
states]{.underline}**. In fact, [one of the major motivations for the
U.S. government in offering an alliance commitment to South Korea was to
gain influence over its president,]{.underline} Syngman Rhee, who had
tried to sabotage the Korean War armistice.6 Even when a patron shares
an adversary with a client, influencing the client remains an important
objective. Third, Yarhi-Milo, Lanoszka, and Cooper argue that the
[perceived military balance]{.underline} between the client and its main
adversary [affects the patron\'s willingness to provide costly
arms]{.underline}. They find that [policymakers who argued that the
military balance did not favor a client or that it was shifting against
it advocated costly transfers]{.underline}. It is also plausible,
however, that those who would like to support a client use the military
balance as a justification. Since the policy transition to costly arms
transfers, Israel has received large amounts of military aid from the
United States despite Israel\'s military superiority against its
adversaries. It is unclear how much of an advantage would be enough
\[End Page 184\] for the United States to reduce this aid. Meanwhile[,
some shifts in which states receive more U.S. military]{.underline}
aid---for example, Pakistan after the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001---[seem to have little to do with the local military
balance]{.underline} **[and are more about buying the clients\'
concessions to facilitate U.S. policy.]{.underline}** In some cases,
[improving the military balance is less important]{.underline} [than
buying influence]{.underline} over the clients. Consider, for example,
the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, and U.S. aid to the two
states. Finally, even though Yarhi-Milo, Lanoszka, and Cooper find in
primary and declassified documents that \"U.S. decisionmakers often
discussed using arms to obtain leverage with Israel,\" they dismiss this
alternative argument by saying that \"U.S. decisionmakers recognized the
difficulties associated with using arms for such purposes\" (p. 135).
[Buying influence and]{.underline} deciding how best to use it is
difficult, but this [does not invalidate the importance of
patrons]{.underline} [seeking to exert influence over their
clients]{.underline}. As Yarhi-Milo, Lanoszka, and Cooper note,
**[future research should further theorize and examine the nature of
patron-client relationships]{.underline}** (pp. 136--138).7

#### US uses arms sales as a tool for power projection of US hegemony 

**Stokes and Waterman 17**---Doug Stokes, a Senior Associate Fellow at
RUSI, Professor of International Relations at the University of Exeter,
and Director of the Centre for Advanced International Studies, and Kit
Waterman, Senior Researcher at the Centre for Advanced International
Studies, University of Exeter, "Beyond balancing? Intrastate conflict
and US grand strategy", *Journal of Strategic Studies, 41:6, 824-849*,
Taylor and Francis Online, June 17, 2017//Lee

Linked to this, [the United States also expends considerable resources
funding security assistance programmes]{.underline} [for a large number
of nations, as well as subsidising and facilitating the sale of large
quantities of arms and equipment]{.underline}. In Figure 1, we display
time series of such military aid combined with US arms sales beginning
in 2000. **[We include both foreign military sales and direct commercial
sales.]{.underline}** The main difference between the two is that the
latter are organised privately between US companies and foreign buyers,
whereas [the former is run through the Department of Defense and has
linkages with the foreign military financing (FMF) where
applicable.]{.underline} As we can see, [all indicators demonstrate that
there has been an increase in the amount of military aid and arms sales
delivered to the rest of the world over this time period.]{.underline}
Whereby the rather obvious spike occurring in 2013 is largely
attributable to the Japanese having placed an unusually large order of
arms from the United States in that year.26 As is apparent, our
empirical data is quite clear: [American involvement in intrastate
warfare and domestic security regimes has been ubiquitous with both
'retrenchment' and 'deep engagement' scholarship often examining these
forms of overseas missions in tangential ways]{.underline} (if at all).
[**This omission** in the grand strategic literature]{.underline}
becomes theoretically [**more interesting when we consider the fact
that** interstate balances of power are often posited as the means by
which US force posture can be recalibrated without having to worry too
much about possible post-American regional]{.underline} security
[orders]{.underline} developing [in ways that may be inimical to US
national security interest]{.underline}s. When we factor this intrastate
element to grand strategic calculations, [how can interstate balances of
power prevent possible negative intrastate conflict dynamics from
developing? This is arguably most problematic for 'offshore balancers'
whose reliance on post-retrenchment pro-US 'onshore balancers' operates
almost entirely at the interstate level. In essence then,]{.underline}
[new post-American regional balances of power, the mechanism that
operationalises its capacity to choose retrenchment]{.underline},
operates entirely at the interstate level with at present little
analysis of intrastate dynamics. [Our call is not to necessarily give
equal weighting to this interstate/intrastate dyad in American strategic
calculation]{.underline}s[, but we have hoped to demonstrate that
minimally, this substate dimension should find its way into grand
strategic debates when weighing US options, not least because of its
prevalence]{.underline}. As we covered earlier, 'deep engagement'
advocates do tend to more directly integrate political--economic
arguments into their analyses, but there is a tendency to omit
evaluation of internal order making in favour of those mechanisms that
address grander interstate developments.27 In terms of impact, and
particularly resources, while there is a sound justification for the
primacy accorded to interstate dynamics, this does not equate to largely
ignoring intrastate developments. [In this sense, the lack of engagement
can only contribute to underspecify our understanding of the role of
American power in generating desired international
outcomes;]{.underline} particularly, as we have identified above,
[intrastate dynamics have played such a pervasive role in American
statecraft]{.underline}. In the following section, [we empirically
underscore our broader theoretical arguments through examining the
contributions that security assistance and stability operations have
made to achieving US economic and strategic objectives.]{.underline} We
[focus the analysis on the funds and resources allocated to Latin
America, the Middle East and Africa.]{.underline} The remaining regions,
particularly the broader Asia--Pacific and Europe, are omitted. Not only
is Europe a central partner in the American-led liberal international
economic order. [But because of its **wealth, general stability and
close resemblance** to the form of political economy deemed most
**amenable to US interests,**]{.underline} [it receives very little in
the way of domestic security support.]{.underline} Likewise, in relation
to support for intrastate order building, American interaction with the
broader Asia--Pacific has also been rather limited, with the only major
exception being Japan, a nation whose recent history and economic
characteristics have been shaped in much the same way as those of
Europe. [Broader engagement with the region has been limited by a number
of historical contingencies, not least a mixture of failed interventions
and hostile political ideologies. Because of this, our sample can be
reduced to the remaining three regions of the globe.]{.underline}

### 2NC---Link---Disarmament

#### Steps of incremental disarmament construes peace as a *[technical achievement]{.underline}* that ignores the integration of militaristic hegemony into social conflicts and hegemony writ large

Bradley S. **Klein**, 19**88**, "Hegemony and Strategic Culture:
American Power Projection and Alliance Defence Politics," Review of
International Studies,

(PhD in Political Science // NC)

Given the terms by which hegemony in the Gramscian sense is produced and
reinforced, many of the categories so dear to the peace movement will
have to be recast[. The production of hegemony is not simply due to the
efforts of one state over others]{.underline}: [the production and
distribution of organic hegemony involves relations of power and
integration that can no longer be confined to the likes of one
state]{.underline}, nor to one country, [as if other countries were
helpless]{.underline}, innocent victims, **[and as if disarmament were a
nonpartisan issue disconnected from other social conflicts along lines
of class, race, gender, environmentalism and regionalism.]{.underline}**
[To make peace part of a counter-hegemonic struggle]{.underline},
however, [the peace movement will have to broaden its base **and not
seek to reproduce**]{.underline} the kind of **[incremental
reformism]{.underline}** [that has so ~~crippled~~ \[shut-down\] other
oppositional movements in the West]{.underline}. [Thus, while
counter-strategic intellectuals have emphasized]{.underline} alternative
defence strategies and more far-reaching arms control and [disarmament
plans]{.underline}, **[to leave the issue at this level is to accept the
prevailing terms of a hegemonic world order]{.underline}**. The comforts
of such a posture are evident. [**Peace is thereby construed as a
technical achievement** requiring but adjustments in
strategy.]{.underline} Advocates of this position thereby acquire a
certain status within the centres of power. [And the basic trajectory of
Western culture is thereby preserved]{.underline}, indeed saluted, as
capable of sustaining a more secure world order. These accommodations
are, of course, appealing. [This is, after all, the real strategy of
hegemony: to turn the sharp edges of dissent into the smooth pearls of
conformity]{.underline}; to make the exercise of power invisible and to
swallow up those who might challenge it. [If a counter-hegemonic,
post-strategic culture is ever to emerge, it will have to come from a
broad-based alliance of diverse social forces mobilized simultaneously
along lines far broader than those posed by the peace movements of
late]{.underline}. [Such an alliance will have to reach out beyond the
Atlantic to embrace those at the periphery of the world who heretofore
have been at the receiving end of strategic culture.]{.underline}
Perhaps it is, after all, unduly Americo-centric to limit that culture
to the practices of the United States. For strategic practice has
pervasive and ugly roots as well in that modern European world order
which originally gave rise to the United States. What concerns peace
movements, then, is the consolidation of these global relations, not
under American dominance alone but within the terms of neo-Gramscian
hegemony on a trans-Atlantic basis.

### 2NC---Link---Reps of Arms Sales 

#### The aff's critique of arms sales rhetoric kills the credibility of sales---key to US power projection 

**Fowler 19**---Randall Fowler, Department of Communication, University
of Maryland, College Park, MD, "Art of the arms deal: Reagan, AWACS, and
the rhetorical Presidency", *Quarterly Journal of Speech, 105:3,
273-296*, Taylor and Francis Online, 2019//Lee

The [Reagan administration's success in this sale had three important
effects. First, it worked to enmesh the Reagan presidency in Middle
Eastern affairs.]{.underline} While Reagan did not come into office
desiring to pay particular attention to the Middle East, [this region
served as the staging ground for many of his major foreign policy
decisions.]{.underline} [Reagan coordinated with Saudi Arabia to arm
**Afghan resistance fighters, bombed Qaddafi's Libya, dispatched Marines
to**]{.underline} (and withdrew them from) [**Lebanon, attempted to
advance an Arab-- Israeli peace, and,** most infamously, **illegally
traded conventional armaments to Iran** in exchange for American
hostages held by Hezbollah]{.underline}. Assessing Reagan's legacy, H.
W. Brands writes that the Middle East meant little to him when he
assumed the presidency ... [. Yet the Middle East came to **mean a great
deal to** Reagan. His reeducation began in his first year in office when
he wrestled with the Israeli government over the sale to Saudi Arabia of
American military hardwar]{.underline}e[, especially AWACS
aircraft]{.underline}.105 [From this vantage, the AWACS deal can be seen
as the Reagan administration's first major step toward an entanglement
in Middle Eastern affairs that would ultimately consume much of his
presidency's foreign policy attention]{.underline}. [Second, the AWACS
sale helped establish a dynamic that has practically defined America's
relationship with the House of Saud for much of the past four
decades.]{.underline} Between 1980 and 1986 -- a particularly intense
period of the Cold War -- the United States supplied Saudi Arabia with
\$14.6 billion worth of military equipment, almost 17% of total US
deliveries to foreign nations.106 After Taiwan, Saudi Arabia was the
second-largest purchaser of American arms from 1995 to 1999.107 Both
Presidents Bush possessed deep financial ties to Saudi Arabia and
provided Riyadh with advanced weaponry.108 And from 2009 to 2014, Saudi
Arabia spent more on American weapons than any other country.109 [The
gap has only widened since then; according to one estimate, the Obama
administration offered a total of \$115 billion worth of weapons to
Riyadh, much of it coming after the nuclear deal with
Iran.1]{.underline}10 [Clearly, the sale of conventional weapons from
American arms manufacturers to the Saudi state plays a very important
role in US--Saudi relations and the **larger power dynamics** of the
Middle East]{.underline}. [By working to pass the AWACS deal, Reagan
helped set the relationship on this current path. Furthermore, the deal
also helped establish Saudi Arabia as the primary ally for the United
States in the Persian Gulf, a role that the Iranian shah played up until
the 1979 revolution.]{.underline} One administration report labeled
Saudi Arabia "the anti-communist leader of the conservative Gulf
states," describing the country as an irreplaceable partner in the
project of Soviet containment.111 [This framing of Saudi Arabia in
American political discourse]{.underline} -- as an indispensable ally
that, for all its unseemliness, is needed to help secure larger US
interests -- **[continues to dominate discussions surrounding the desert
kingdom today]{.underline}**. [By beginning the project of depicting
Saudi Arabia as a necessary partner for advancing American goals in the
Middle East, Reagan helped establish a rhetorical template for talking
about Saudi Arabia that has predominated into the War on Terror
era]{.underline}. Third, the [Reagan]{.underline} administration's
[commitment to the sale of AWACS marked a full rhetorical
reversal]{.underline} [from]{.underline} President [Carter's
lamentation]{.underline} over US sales figures in the international arms
market. [Far from using presidential rhetoric to restrict or deplore
America's role in the global weapons trade, Reagan devoted]{.underline}
significant [resources to passing an arms deal against Congressional
opposition,]{.underline} presaging the streamlining of international
weapon agreements that took place under his presidency. In fact, since
"arms sales did not see actual restraint in any large-scale manner
during Carter's tenure," [Reagan primarily represented a shift in
rhetoric, not policy, regarding international weapons
transfers]{.underline}.112 A 1981 editorial in the magazine Aviation
Week & Space Technology said as much, arguing that "the Reagan
guidelines are more a repeal of Carter human rights doctrinarism than
the adoption of a new policy." 113 [In rhetorical terms, then, this
episode signifies a shift in presidential discourse that has to some
extent reverberated to the present day, where presidents sign arms deals
with flourish and US-made weapons are exported to the tune of billions
of dollars each year]{.underline}.114 [Put differently, Reagan's
rhetoric worked to reconstitute the bounds of accepted political action
regarding arms transfers.]{.underline} The modern presidency often
functions as a vehicle for legitimizing social or political practices.
G. Thomas Goodnight writes that the "president's approval has been an
elite and public object of desire avidly sought, anticipated and debated
... a specific rhetorical presidency is constituted in the ongoing
emphasis, interpretation, and enactment of a democratically elected
candidate within and against the expected roles" he inhabits.115 [This
observation bears insight for Reagan. Given the unsettled field of
discourse regarding American weapons sales overseas following the
Carter]{.underline} presidency, [Reagan's decision to support arms
exports generally and the AWACS sale specifically can be understood as a
well-timed rhetorical intervention on a subject of supreme foreign
policy importance.]{.underline} That is, unlike Carter, Reagan offered
"grants of presidential legitimacy" to the practice of selling US-made
arms abroad.116 [This approval]{.underline}, backed up as it was by
Reagan's electoral success, [shifted the rhetorical norms for presidents
regarding international weapons deals.]{.underline} After Reagan[, few
presidents would dare attack the arms export industry with the ferocity
of Carter,]{.underline} and -- as the Trump example opening this essay
illustrates -- some presidents have even considered it their duty to
operate as a kind of arms-salesman-in-chief. [Viewed thusly, what
matters about the AWACS episode is not so much the instrumental effect
of Reagan's specific rhetorical appeals]{.underline}, [but the long-term
effects that his effort of presidential persuasion carried and the
precedent it set. To be certain]{.underline}, there have been plenty of
debates regarding the international weapons trade and [America's role in
that business since the days of Reagan. Before and after Reagan, the
president has been deeply involved in **deploying arms transfers as
tools of US diplomacy and power projection across the
globe.**]{.underline} However, [the function of presidential rhetoric in
that process]{.underline} -- especially as it comes to critiquing
American arms manufacturers -- [has never returned to the tone
established by Carter. Reagan's intervention to pass the AWACS sale
should therefore be read as a **pivotal momen**t not only in arms export
policy or US--Saudi relations, but for presidential rhetoric as
well.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales allow the US to maintain diplomatic flexibility and influence

Despite the historic debates and current transfers of conventional arms
to limit nuclear ambitions, few studies have examined whether arms sales
can prevent proliferation.9 This research explores the conditions under
which conventional arms can curb nuclear proliferation. This is an
unanswered question relevant to policy and theory. Practically,
providing conventional arms is a flexible tool the U.S. can use to limit
the nuclear ambitions of arms recipients. Figure 1.1 on the following
page depicts the range of U.S. nonproliferation and counterproliferation
options. Historically, [providing conventional arms was a tool that the
U.S. considered]{.underline} only [when influencing the practices of
allies or neutrals]{.underline}. This is in contrast to economic aid,
which Washington has provided to hostile countries in exchange for
nuclear restraint.10 **[Conventional arms transfers provide the U.S.
with diplomatic flexibility and room for maneuver.]{.underline}** [Most
other measures on the figure]{.underline} - [such as confidence
building, arms control, and sanctions - require multilateral, regional,
or international cooperation**. U.S. can transfer conventional arms
unilaterally**]{.underline}. Arms transfers avoid the potentially
disastrous consequences of using military options to eliminate
troublesome nuclear programs - consequences that range from eliciting
international criticism to struggling to restore order in targeted
countries.\" Providing [military sales also prevents the U.S. from too
closely tying itself to other countries]{.underline}. A [military
alliance constrains American policies and strategic interests by either
imposing alliance requirements or obliging Washington to be accountable
for the policies and practices of its allies.]{.underline} In contrast,
**[the U.S. can balance one-sided transfers to nuclear aspiring
countries with smaller arms deals to neighboring states and rivals of
the main arms recipient]{.underline}**. In the recent years, [military
sales have become a primary and least contentious way for the U.S. to
forge international alliances]{.underline}. As one expert argued as
early as the 1980s, old displays of force such as formal alliances and
foreign bases are being replaced by the diplomacy of Preventive strike
on nuclear facilities; military attack or invasion Ally / Adversary 12
\"shor\[ing\] up friendly states through the provision of arms.\"12 The
2003 Iraq War brought with it the formation of the Coalition of the
Willing as well as debate on the usefulness of traditional, permanent
alignments versus ad-hoc coalitions.13 If the United States can form
ad-hoc coalitions to support particular causes by offering aid and arms,
does the U.S. still need to invest as much into traditional alliances?
As Washington pondered this question, threats to established alliances
became apparent. Without a clear Cold War nemesis, the U.S. could not
justify the tremendous defense expenditures of maintaining nearly a
thousand military bases abroad. In 2005, the U.S. authorized its fifth
round of military base closures since the end of the Cold War. Scaling
down foreign military bases and deployed U.S. troops threatened the
essence of traditional alliances. Not only is the U.S. budget requiring
cutback, many countries do not welcome U.S. bases and see American
military presence as a form of imperialism.14 Even in places where
long-standing U.S. bases remain, local residents have become more vocal
about the negative economic and social impacts U.S. military bases
bring.15 U.S. deployments of nuclear weapons abroad are also currently
out of the question. As North Korean provocations threatened South
Korea, South Korea\'s Defense Minister raised the possibility of
re-deployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons on Korean soil. This was
immediately denied by the Obama administration as well as corrected by
the South Korean Presidential Office.16 Any American redeployment of
nuclear weapons abroad will face a tough sell in the U.S. and abroad.
Since the U.S. cannot easily employ the most forceful ways to influence
alliances - such as providing U.S. soldiers, bases, and nuclear
weapons - this dissertation focuses on the more practical option of U.S.
conventional arms transfers. Can U.S. military sales help prevent
neutrals and friendly countries from seeking nuclear weapons?

U.S. [conventional arms sales may prevent nuclear proliferation by
demonstrating U.S. alliance commitment to the arms
recipient]{.underline}. This dissertation understands military alliances
as having two components: (a) a formal security guarantee expressed
verbally or in writing and (b) visible displays of military support for
the ally. **[Selling conventional arms is an important way the United
States provides military support to its ally.]{.underline}** Formal
security guarantee First, security guarantees vary by the formality of
commitment, or how explicit patrons agree to use force to defend their
proteges.78 [Security guarantees range from unilateral declaratory
statements to not attack a country to mutual defense pacts where patrons
promise to defend allies]{.underline}. Figure 2.1 on the following page
shows the spectrum of commitments. On the lower end of the spectrum are
unilateral or universal declaratory statements. These include public
statements or declarations of nuclear weapon policy that lack a definite
treaty obligation.79 [Unilateral declarations are weak commitments
because they are not legally binding.]{.underline} They often do not
apply in cases of conflict.80 [Along with declaratory
statements]{.underline}, **[nuclear weapon states can also offer more
specific negative security guarantees]{.underline}**. [Nuclear weapons
states provide negative security guarantees]{.underline} when they agree
to the banning of production, testing, and use of nuclear weapons on
select countries or regions - nuclear weapon free countries or zones -
by signing a treaty.81 \' 82 [A number of states have also declared
national nuclear weapon free zones through domestic
measures]{.underline}.83 Moving along the spectrum, **[positive security
guarantees are stronger than negative commitment]{.underline}**s.84 A
[positive security guarantee is \"when a nuclear weapons state would
consider an attack on its ally]{.underline}, the recipient of the
guarantee, [to be an attack on its own territory]{.underline}, thus
calling forth the use of its conventional and possibly nuclear forces in
defense of the aggrieved party.\"85 There are several main types of
positive security guarantees: executive assurances, congressional
mandates, and mutual defense treaties. [Close allies may enjoy U.S.
executive assurances, or assurances from the President]{.underline}
given his/her \"constitutional powers as Commander-in-Chief and executor
of U.S. foreign relations.\"86 [Executive assurances vary from
statements without binding force to \"cooperation\" agreements of
binding legal force where both governments agree to take appropriate
action in the event of aggression or threat of
aggression]{.underline}.87 \' 88 Stronger guarantees require
Congressional ratification. On the lower end, Congress can issue acts
such as the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. The Taiwan Relations Act
obligates the United States \"to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive
character.\"89 On the higher end are mutual defense treaties that
require Senate ratification and can \"commit in advance use of U.S.
forces to defend territory of a foreign state.\" 90,91

### 2NC---Balancing Military and Economic Good 

#### Managing a balance between economic productivity and military strength is key to overall power projection 

**Norrlof and Wolforth 19**---Carla Norrlof, an associate professor at
the University of Toronto, and William C. Wolforth, the Daniel Webster
Professor at Dartmouth College, "Raison de l'Hégémonie (The Hegemon's
Interest): Theory of the Costs and Benefits of Hegemony", *Security
Studies, 28:3, 422-450*, Taylor and Francis Online, June 10, 2019//Lee

[Different kinds of international systems confront hegemons with varying
relationships between]{.underline} military [capabilities]{.underline}
(protection) [and]{.underline} the [economy]{.underline} (production).
In different ideal-type "worlds," complementarity between protection and
production---and therefore the costs and benefits of hegemony---add up
very differently. [These worlds map on to different historical
international systems and, it turns out, different key arguments often
propounded as universal in the literature on hegemony. The first set of
highly relevant interactions that vary through time concerns
**productive economic activity and military strength.**]{.underline}
Here the key variation pertains to [the degree to which military
strength is necessary for wealth and the degree to which
civilian]{.underline} economic [productivity is necessary for military
power]{.underline} (see Table 1). When strong states can grab economic
resources by force, military power is necessary to protect and acquire
wealth. Under these circumstances, militarily weak states can create
wealth, but they cannot protect wealth. Militarily powerful states do
not need to create wealth; they can acquire wealth by \[Chart Omitted\]
conquering and looting weaker states[. Under these conditions, states
can be affluent without a productive civilian economy but not without
military capability. Easy lootability]{.underline} clearly [has
implications for the profitability of being a militarily potent economic
predator]{.underline}. When civilian economic productivity is not
required for military power, we are in a stark "state-of-nature" world
in which economically unproductive military powerhouses routinely
subjugate and loot more productive polities (northwest quadrant of Table
1). In the fourteenth century, Ibn Khaldun proposed a cyclical theory of
history that presumed just such a world.6 Unproductive but militarily
powerful societies conquered productive polities until the erstwhile
barbarians themselves succumbed to the weakening effect of civilization,
only to be conquered by the next set of barbarians.7 [In such a world,
the economic benefits of military primacy are obvious. In other cases,
wealth is easily lootable, but civilian productivity is necessary for
military power]{.underline} (southwest quadrant). [Militarily strong
states can still raid, but the spoils of conquest are insufficient to
finance military prowess: indigenous economic capability is
required]{.underline}. When the positive relationship between those who
have military power and those who have wealth breaks down, a trade-off
emerges[. Developing productive economic activity diverts resources from
maintaining a coercive capability, and vice versa. **Managing** this
**trade-off is necessary for political and economic survival.** States
exclusively relying on **booty for enrichment** to **fund military
prowess** will be outcompeted by states mixing predatory looting with a
productive civilian economy.]{.underline} Until the mid-twentieth
century, this hybrid strategy was necessary to achieve great-power
status, explaining the advantage of colonial powers (for example,
Portugal, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Great Britain, Germany,
Belgium, and Italy's) over noncolonial powers.8 Relatively unproductive
states may seek to overwhelm that trade-off through massive resource
extraction, as the Soviet Union did in the mid-twentieth century
(northeast quadrant). But the postindustrial and information revolutions
stacked the odds against that approach.9 Because the Soviet empire was
created and maintained in a systemic setting hostile to pillaging, it
was short-lived by historical standards. This overall setting prevailed
with increasing strength after the industrial revolution and into the
twenty and twenty-first centuries (southeast quadrant). During this
time, however, [military power continues to play a role in establishing
and enforcing property rights. To some degree, therefore, wealth still
emerges from the barrel of a gun]{.underline}.1[0 These four "possible
worlds" derived from the relationship between military strength and
wealth creation under conditions of low versus high barriers to plunder
directly contradict a long tradition of rise-and-decline scholarship:
there can be no universal theory of imperial overstretch. The costs and
benefits of establishing and sustaining military primacy are contingent
upon a constantly changing potential for complementarity between
protection and production]{.underline}. In premodern worlds,
specializing in military conquest could be profitable for centurie[s.
Yet the complementarities and trade-offs captured in Table 1 did not
figure prominently in the 1980s hegemony literature.]{.underline}

### 2NC---Security Networks Key 

#### Security Networks are critical---arms sales help establish those networks 

**Norrlof and Wolforth 19**---Carla Norrlof, an associate professor at
the University of Toronto, and William C. Wolforth, the Daniel Webster
Professor at Dartmouth College, "Raison de l'Hégémonie (The Hegemon's

\*Charts and Figures omitted

Raison de l'Hegemonie can apply to leading states in different systemic
settings, with the latter-twentieth-century United States representing
an especially strong case. [The result is a hegemonic order that can
feed back and sustain the core capabilities of the leading
state.]{.underline} The development of social networks that may enhance
complementarity between protection and production reinforces this
logic.36 [Hegemonic capability is necessary]{.underline} (but not
sufficient) [to achieve centrality within a security network. **Power
projection is required** for sustaining far-flung alliance networks in
different regions]{.underline}. Location is also key. [The combination
of power projection, especially naval capability, and location helped
win the British Empire and the United States central positions in their
respective orders]{.underline}. Figures 1--3 compare the US security
network with those of its past and current challengers. They are
textbook applications of network analysis, showing that superior
military capability facilitates network centrality and that centrality
promotes security ties between similar nodes ("homophily") that may
evolve into homogenous subgroups, as is particularly true in the US
case.37 [However, while geopolitical factors are necessary for
centrality, they are insufficient for predicting what relationships will
form, as shown by the US-USSR-China comparison. Despite the sharp growth
in China's military capabilities, North Korea remains Beijing's only
security ally]{.underline}. [The United States' **vast preexisting
security network has drastically reduced the probability of ties between
other countries and rival great powers.**]{.underline} Once formed these
relationships become sticky and path dependent. They are rarely severed
(though examples of lapsed pacts exist on all sides; for example, see
those between the United States and New Zealand in 1986 and between the
Soviet Union and China in 1980).38 [Many scholars writing on hegemonic
stability and grand strategy focus on the costs of US security
relationships rather than the opportunities they provid]{.underline}e[.
They worry that great powers with extensive security ties to militarily
weaker states will end up saddling the full costs of public good
provision while allies free ride. Such a perspective predicts burden
sharing based on the distribution of capabilities and group size but
misses levers of influence and autonomy conditioned on network patterns,
which inform dynamics between]{.underline} security
[partners.]{.underline} Studying patterns in the security network shows
the ramifications of unequal interstate connections, both in terms of
their magnitude and arrangement. Of particular relevance are networks
with "structural holes"--- defined as the absence of connections between
two states both connected to a third state.40 Structural holes provide
third-party benefits, tertius gaudens, from brokering connections
between unconnected parties.41 [When there are no structural holes in a
state's connections but other states have them, the fully connected
state also benefits from structural autonomy]{.underline}, which refers
to the extra flexibility in managing its own connections. As Figure 1
shows, the United States is connected to sixty-four states grouped into
two alliances, NATO and the OAS. As Michael Mastanduno stresses in his
contribution to this issue,42 not all alliances are equal, nor are all
alliance members equal in terms of their underlying capability or their
relationship to the United States. [Network analysis provides a way for
us to think about how the United States can use these asymmetries to its
advantage. Within each alliance, states are also connected to each
other. Outside the two main security alliances, NATO and the
OAS,]{.underline} [the United States is connected to five additional
security partners. All of them have structural holes because they do not
have formal security connections to members within the two alliances and
Canada.]{.underline} Structural holes also exist between the two
alliances, which are formally unconnected. [The US security network is
unmatched because of four characteristics: the scale of the US network;
disproportionate US capability within the network; US centrality within
the network]{.underline} (as measured by the number of US ties to other
countries); [and the structure of the network]{.underline} (as measured
by other countries ties to the US and each other). [These properties
offer the United States extraordinary leverage and
flexibility.]{.underline}

#### Alliances help reduce conflict---US security provisions are key to maintaining that network 

**Norrlof and Wolforth 19**---Carla Norrlof, an associate professor at
the University of Toronto, and William C. Wolforth, the Daniel Webster
Professor at Dartmouth College, "Raison de l'Hégémonie (The Hegemon's
Interest): Theory of the Costs and Benefits of Hegemony", *Security
Studies, 28:3, 422-450*, Taylor and Francis Online, June 10, 2019//Lee

On logical and empirical grounds however, this objection should not be
overstated. [The value of security for allies is not dichotomous; **it
is a matter of degree**]{.underline}. Even if the threat is lower in the
post--Cold War era, Russia and China increasingly present their
neighbors with real security challenges. A security guarantee from an
overseas superpower remains a big net plus for dealing with current and
potential security challenges. [Security scholars have developed a
number of models and theories]{.underline} (offensive realism, defensive
realism, security-dilemma theory, etc.) [that converge on a single
proposition: credible security guarantees from an overseas power are
likely]{.underline} to [make regions of contiguous and potentially
antagonistic]{.underline} states more secure than they would be if they
relied on pure self-help.63 [The key claim]{.underline} underlying this
partial consensus [is]{.underline} that it is much easier for [an
overseas security provider to generate **credible** military postures
for defense without being credible for offense]{.underline}, alleviating
(though of course not eliminating) security dilemmas. [The latest
empirical research on]{.underline} the net effects of defensive
[alliances]{.underline} also [finds]{.underline} that [they tend to
reduce]{.underline} the occurrence of military [conflict]{.underline}.64
Studies of contemporary regional security buttress this finding,
suggesting that US defensive alliances---especially in East
Asia---generate a net increase in security.65 [A massive new wave of
research on nuclear proliferation]{.underline} also, overall,
[lends]{.underline} strong [support to the claim that US security
guarantees **have the effect of reducing the spread of nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}.66 And most (though not all) security scholars
expect that nuclear spread--- especially to smaller, less stable
countries---would increase insecurity. [All of this suggests that **US
security provision continues to have value**]{.underline}, [and thus
some of the positive externalities it generated in the Cold
War]{.underline}. In addition, the security alliances always involved
more than simply providing a counterbalance to Soviet power but also
entailed managing sometimes rivalrous relations among allies themselves.
[Strengthening the alliance thus also has a net positive effect for the
United States, as does all of the access the alliance provides to
crucial resources and information helpful for dealing with a range of
contingencies, including counterterrorism]{.underline}. On logical
grounds alone, [therefore, we would not expect the shift from bipolarity
to unipolarity to vitiate the complementary interaction we discussed
above between security networks and others. We would expect at most some
reduction in these effects.]{.underline}

At the moment, [a large swath of the literature on US grand strategy
focuses largely on interstate balances of power, omitting the intrastate
dynamics]{.underline} that have proved vital in achieving broader
strategic goals. [This is justifiable given how transformational major
interstate wars are for US national security interests.]{.underline}
However, whilst on [a lower order of threat, intrastate conflict and
instability has played a major role in US coercive
statecraft.]{.underline} [Going forward, whether it is
fighting]{.underline} Islamist [terrorism]{.underline} in the Middle
East, [intervening in]{.underline} ongoing and bloody [civil wars or
engaging]{.underline} [in]{.underline} intrastate [proxy wars with great
power rivals, they look likely to continue to be part of America's
strategic calculus.]{.underline} Moreover[, **funding and involvement**
in intrastate conflict and competition has formed a **vital component**
of the way in which the United States has **promoted** specific forms of
regional political economy and **maintained its global
leadership**.]{.underline} In short, the intrastate dimension matters.
Our paper has attempted to address this element and relate it to grand
strategic debates and called for a broader strategic continuum that,
minimally, addresses these crucial intrastate conflict dynamics.

The Costs and Benefits of Hegemony [The]{.underline} nature, durability,
and [politics of hegemonic order depends]{.underline} crucially [on the
costs and benefits to the hegemon]{.underline} of [providing security
beyond its borders.]{.underline} We have shown that, under some
conditions, raison de l'Hégémonie pays externally. Focusing on the
leading state itself and on the conditions under which protection
complements production, the theory developed here addresses a part of
the larger debate on the nature of hegemonic order featured in this
special issue. Yet it is a central one. For, as we have shown,
**[failure to appreciate the potential for raison de l'Hégémonie
explains why so many scholars misdiagnosed the staying power of the
US-led order]{.underline}**. [A state's military and economic capability
has always been the most fundamental predictor of its ability to realize
national objectives]{.underline}, and the optimal balance and feedback
between these forms of material capability varies through time. To
understand whether maintaining military capability comes at the expense
of thriving economic capability, or whether the material basis for
hegemony is mutually reinforcing, we posited two highly
context-dependent sets of interactions. The first concerns the degree to
which military strength is necessary for wealth and the degree to which
civilian economic productivity is necessary for military power. The
second concerns the global economy's sensitivity to insecurity and the
effect of economic openness on a state's security. Using these
interactions, we unpacked the post--mid-twentieth-century setting: a
productive civilian economy necessary for generating military power that
is useful for other than predatory economic purposes residing within an
international economy highly sensitive to security shocks where states
are more secure with economic openness than closure. These circumstances
have profound implications for the structure of the international
system. They offer few incentives to specialize in military power for
gain. Only states with a sufficiently productive economy capable of
funding coercive specialization can avoid sharp trade-offs. Even so,
possessing a vibrant economy does not necessarily provide incentives to
allocate resources to the military sector over and above what is
required in pursuit of safe borders and other strategic interests
captured by raison d'état. To specialize in defensive and offensive
capability requires a different rationale. Raison de l'Hégémonie is
based on the premise that [as the single largest military and economic
power]{.underline}, [the hegemon must sustain the capacity to protect
the international economy]{.underline} for pecuniary reasons both in
order [to continue benefiting from open exchange and to fund military
prowess]{.underline}. [Securing the international system represents
potential benefits]{.underline} beyond what a mere economic capability
edge can achieve; pursuing raison de l'Hégémonie offers opportunities
[to form lasting relationships]{.underline} [that produce brokering
opportunities and **raise a state's degrees of freedom**]{.underline}.
The public-goods dilemma of collective action applies comparatively
weakly to the US security network, which more accurately resembles a
system of competing club goods. But even if we were to consider this
joint system of competing club goods as individual components in a
larger public-good effort, the United States has the ability to use
preferential access within its web of security relationships to
transform public goods into excludable club goods or impure public goods
by creating some degree of rivalry. Under these circumstances,
international cooperation is no longer a sure drain on the United States
either systemically or within specific alliances. In short, [being at
the center of a system of defensive alliances offers]{.underline}
distinct [rewards in the form of]{.underline} **[fewer constraints, more
opportunities, better bargains, greater influence, and even deference
and attention from those in less favored positions]{.underline}**.
[Security provision bolsters economic exchange, provides economic
leverage, and encourages socialization.]{.underline} The [US decline
debates]{.underline} of the 1980s [exaggerate]{.underline}d [the
scale]{.underline}, [trajectory, and significance of protection costs
largely due to the failure to appreciate shifts in the structural and
strategic setting]{.underline}, [as well as the effect of security
relationships on economic processes]{.underline}.
**[Scholars]{.underline}** therefore [missed elements of stability in
the US global position]{.underline}. Significantly, they [**did not
situate the cost-benefit assessment of US hegemony in a larger
structural context specifying potential complementarity between**
military power]{.underline} (**[protection]{.underline}**) [**and**
economically productive activity]{.underline}
(**[production]{.underline}**). [In addition, they failed to consider
the **social sources of power**]{.underline}, which military power can
foster and which accrues over time. [Our assessment of the current
setting suggests that these omissions still characterize much declinist
thinking and policy prescription]{.underline}. [Both will]{.underline}
therefore [continue to underestimate the significance of US security
provision]{.underline} and of maintaining security alliances for
bolstering the economic order and for US security.

#### No risk of multipolarity or China becoming the hegemon -- the US is still very far ahead, China hasn't made moves to advance, and even if they win any risk of transition the case still outweighs on timeframe.

**EA 4/12**/2019, (EurekAlert, "Jonathan Pass: \'It\'s too soon to talk
about the end of American hegemony\'",

\"For now, I would say that [it is]{.underline} still [too soon to talk
about the end of American hegemony]{.underline}: **[global structural
changes occur slowly and often in contradictory forms]{.underline}**\",
Dr. Pass affirms, citing as an example how, after the 2008 financial
crisis, investors fled to the dollar and US Treasury bonds. \"[Until
China carries out the complete internationalisation of the
renminbi]{.underline}, [current account liberalization]{.underline},
[**and** opens up its internal market to foreign
investors]{.underline} - measures with potentially important domestic
political repercussions - [it is likely that the United States will
continue to enjoy this]{.underline} ~~privileged~~
[position]{.underline}\", he adds. One of work\'s principal merits is
the elaboration of a novel theoretical framework, which has also been
published in the article \"Gramsci Meets Emergent Materialism: Towards a
Neo Neo-Gramscian Perspective on World Order\" in the journal Review of
International Studies (Cambridge University Press). The author carries
out a critique of the neo-Gramscian perspective, offering a
sophisticated, explicitly materialist, theory on world hegemony rooted
in critical realism. \"[In international relations\", he explains,
\"there is a tendency to conceptualise hegemony as being synonymous with
either \'domination\']{.underline} (based on coercion[) or
\'intellectual and moral leadership\']{.underline} (a consensual and
intersubjective relationship), [when in reality both elements are always
present]{.underline}\". With regards its main theme, \'American Hegemony
in the 21st Century: a Neo neo-Gramscian Perspective\' focuses on
American hegemony, exploring the origins and construction process of
this \'leadership\', in addition to its shifts and transformations
during periods of crisis. Jonathan Pass emphasizes that the causes of
American hegemony\'s present crisis can be found in the internal
contradictions of the neoliberal/financialization accumulation regime
and the conservative revolution that United States \'exported\' from the
mid-1970s onwards. Nevertheless, and [although its hegemony might be
weakening]{.underline}, the author makes clear that [**the US still
maintains its dominance** in key economic sectors]{.underline} (e.g.
finance, IT and retail) [and industries]{.underline} (e.g. aerospace,
pharmaceuticals and arms). Likewise, he stresses that both cultural and
[military hegemony are in good health]{.underline}: \"For now, [nobody
questions US supremacy]{.underline} in the audiovisual sector,
advertising/marketing and the arts. Nobody doubts it boasts the most
influential media, social networks and elite universities in the world,
or that its military forces far exceed any rival with regards the
sophistication and might of its weaponry and global power projection\".
Pass maintains that we are living through what Gramsci called
\'interregnum\': a crisis created when the old order is dying but the
new one has yet to be born. \"When the capitalist system enters a
crisis, it is usually those \'at the bottom\' who end up paying the
consequences. Unsurprisingly the lower classes seek solutions outside
the \'mainstream\'. Given the weakness of the Left, predictably it is
right-wing popularism such as that of Trump, UKIP or Vox, that end up
attracting followers\", he asserts. In the book, the researcher
describes the rise of China as an \"historical event\" producing a
restructuring of the global capitalist system and affecting power
relations both between and within states. To evaluate China\'s \'world
hegemon\' potential, the author dedicates chapter 5 to analysing its
evolution over the last 40 years. \"It has been undergoing what Gramsci
termed a \'passive revolution\': a socio-economic transformation
directed from above. During almost all this time it has remained
faithful to Deng Xiaoping\'s maxim \'hide our capabilities and bide our
time\' with respects to the world order\", Dr. Pass claims, adding that
things started to change for China following the 2008 financial crisis,
which made it clear just how unsustainable its economic growth model and
neoliberal/financialization accumulation regime were. \"Since then,
Beijing has been much more proactive in the global economy, supporting
the international expansion of its corporations, setting up its own
multilateral institutions, away from of the Bretton Woods \'trio\', and
launching its own particular Marshall Plan across Eurasia (Belt and Road
Initiative). Said measures, needless to say, have not gone down well
with Washington\", he holds. Finally, one of the key arguments of the
book is that world hegemony depends upon the \'internationalization\' of
the social forces emergent from the dynamics of its national class
system. The author explains that the big challenge for Xi Jinping is how
to reconcile the official, nominally communist, political regime with
the socio-economic reality: a ferociously capitalist country with
exorbitant levels of economic and regional inequality. Concerning the
outlook for the coming years, Pass errs on the side of caution: \"[It\'s
difficult to make predictions about the future. One has to remember that
hegemony is not a \'state\', but rather a \'process\']{.underline}.
Historically, hegemonic [transitions are long, complex and
bellicose]{.underline}. [Much will depend on how the huge contradictions
inside China play out, especially the dynamic of its \'passive
revolution\']{.underline}.

According to Brooks and Wohlforth, [American hegemony is beneficial
to]{.underline} both the United States and [the world]{.underline}
primarily [because it greatly reduces security competition by rendering
the balance of power inoperable]{.underline} and continues to confer
significant benefits to the United States. For Brooks and Wohlforth, it
is of vital importance that the United States continues to pursue a
grand strategy of primacy or "deep engagement" in order to prevent the
return of balance-of-power politics, which they argue is not possible in
a unipolar system (Brooks, Ikenberry, and Wohlforth, 2013, pp. 7-51). In
contrast, 'unipolar pessimists' believe that the United States' relative
power position is declining and view the grand strategy of primacy to be
antithetical to American interests. Most structural realists believe
that global hegemony is either impossible to achieve or fleeting. Not
only is it difficult to dominate the entire globe, but structural
realists strongly believe in the prevalence of balance-of-power
politics. Contrary to unipolar optimists, structural realists do not
believe that balancing has failed to take place since the dawn of the
unipolar moment. Indeed, it is for the very reason that active balancing
is taking place especially on the part of China and Russia, that many
structural realists argue that the United States needs to abandon the
grand strategy of primacy or deep engagement and adopt a grand strategy
of restraint or offshore balancing (Posen, 2002, pp. 36-42). Liberal
conceptions of hegemony have much to offer on the debate about US
hegemony. Instead of simply emphasising material capabilities,
proponents of liberal hegemony accentuate the leadership and
institutionalised components of hegemony. However, like unipolar
optimists, [those adhering to]{.underline} liberal versions of
[hegemonic stability theory argue that American hegemony is
beneficial]{.underline} to both the United States and the world [and
should be maintained]{.underline}. The argument is that [the United
States is better able to pursue]{.underline} a liberal grand strategy --
[democracy promotion, free trade, interdependence, and multilateral
institutionalism]{.underline} -- when it has unrivalled capabilities
(Ikenberry, 2000). With respect to whether the United States can
maintain its unipolar position indefinitely, liberals are, in Layne's
terminology, unipolar agnostics. [The question about the durability of
American hegemony is]{.underline} not just about trends in the relative
distribution of power but [about the character of American
leadership]{.underline}. [According to]{.underline} liberal conceptions
of [h]{.underline}egemonic [s]{.underline}tability [t]{.underline}heory,
[US power is not used to dominate others, but rather to provide the
leadership that is necessary for an open, liberal international order to
exist]{.underline}. This is the crux of Ikenberry's story of how the
United States after World War Two built and maintained a liberal
hegemonic order that has produced peace and prosperity for the world.
According to Ikenberry, the United States did not use its preponderant
power after World War Two to dominate the world and create an empire.
Instead, American hegemonic leadership was wisely used to strike a grand
bargain and establish the foundations of a liberal international order.
[With the rise of new powers]{.underline}, the growth of right-wing
populism, the turn to authoritarianism, [and]{.underline} the election
of Donald [Trump]{.underline}, the [durability]{.underline} of the
liberal international order [is being called into question]{.underline}.
**[Yet most]{.underline}** liberals **[remain confident that the liberal
international order will endure]{.underline}**.

[Deterrence deals with states' attempts to prevent others from
challenging the status quo]{.underline}. The need for
[deterrence]{.underline} to prevent these challenges [depends upon
whether thestate desires alterations to the status]{.underline}
[quo]{.underline}. **[Deterrence is not needed to prevent a state that
is satisfied with the status quo from initiating a
challenge.]{.underline}** [Deterrence is only relevant when states seek
alterations]{.underline} in the status quo. [If neither state in a dyad
seeks to alter the status quo]{.underline}, then [there is no
deterrence.]{.underline} If [one state seeks to alter the status quo but
the other does not, there is unilateral deterrence]{.underline}. And
finally, a situation where both sides of a dyad seek alterations to the
status quo is one of mutual deterrence. Perfect deterrence theory models
both mutual and unilateral deterrence situations and demonstrates that
[deterrence is more stable in unilateral than mutual
deterrence]{.underline}.50 Senese and Quackenbush apply this logic to an
analysis of settlements to militarised interstate disputes.51 They argue
that [imposed settlements lead to unilateral deterrence whereas
negotiated settlements and disputes ending without a
settlement]{.underline} **[require mutual deterrence to maintain
peace]{.underline}**. Accordingly, [they expect imposed settlements to
be the most stable]{.underline}, and their empirical analysis strongly
supports this conclusion. Given strong empirical support for the
theoretical prediction that unilateral deterrence is more stable than
mutual deterrence, it would seem to make sense for states to desire an
'escape from mutual deterrence'.52 Since power is satisfying53 a [state
may be able to move from mutual to unilateral deterrence]{.underline}
[by increasing its power relative to its counterpart]{.underline}.
Morgan argues that [this implies 'that a challenger is irrational enough
to let the deterrer achieve unilateral deterrence]{.underline} -- [the
deterrer is rational in trying to escape mutual deterrence while the
challenger is irrational enough to let this happen]{.underline}.'54 But
a move from mutual to unilateral deterrence does not have such
implications. **[Power is not the same thing as
satisfaction]{.underline}**.55 Therefore, if [the deterrer wants to
escape mutual deterrence]{.underline}, then ~~he~~ [they only needs to
no longer desire an alteration of the status quo]{.underline} -- [no
increases in power are necessary.]{.underline} And even [if the deterrer
does increase in power dramatically**, this would not at all imply
irrational action**]{.underline} by the challenger, **[since such an
increase does not depend on any action by the challenger
whatsoever]{.underline}**. Therefore, Morgan's concerns that [attempts
to escape from mutual deterrence could cause instability are not
logically supported]{.underline}. **[Unilateral deterrence is more
stable than mutual deterrence,]{.underline}** all else being equal. [If
a state wants to escape from mutual deterrence, it only needs to decide
that it is satisfied with the status quo and therefore no longer needs
to be deterred]{.underline}. While the distinction between unilateral
and mutual deterrence rests on the interests of the states involved, the
next distinction is based upon the weapons possessed by these states.

The concept of deterrence is an ancient one; even the Romans understood
that 'if you want peace, make ready for war'.5 It was the nuclear
revolution that brought the logic of deterrence under the microscopic
scholarship of International Relations. Classical deterrence theory is a
product of the Cold War, a conflict in which nuclear armaments
necessitated that war avoidance take on new meaning. 3Thomas Schelling's
oft-cited definition presents deterrence as 'persuading a potential
enemy that he should in his own interest avoid certain courses of
activity'.6 [Influencing behavior through fear involves two
processes]{.underline}: [deterrence -- 'inducing an adversary . . . not
to do something',]{.underline} [and compellence --]{.underline}
[inducing another 'to do something]{.underline}.'7 While the former
deals with the 'don'ts' of inter-unit relations, compellence -- as the
root 'compel' suggests -- deals with the 'dos'. It requires that the
defender convey what action is expected and how inaction will be met
with retaliation. A useful way to distinguish the two is to relate them
to a status quo. Wyn Bowen suggests that **[deterrence is meant to
'preserve the status quo']{.underline}** -- [to prevent another from
'initiating a course of action']{.underline} -- while compellence is
based on altering an existing relationship.8 In either case, the
objective is to prevent undesired behavior and coerce an adversary to
comply with one's preferences. Deterrence has been sub-divided into
casual logics and processes.9 Most importantly for counterterrorism is
Glen Snyder's distinction between deterrence by threat of punishment and
deterrence by denial.10 [Deterrence by punishment relies on threatening
to harm something an adversary values]{.underline}. During the Cold War,
Washington threatened to attack Moscow, and Moscow, Washington. Both
were deterred because of the costs associated with initiating an attack.
A [complicating matter involving the calculus of punishment is the
potential costs of inaction on the part of the
challenger.]{.underline}11 [While pursuing an unwanted action may result
in punishment]{.underline}, [acquiescing to a deterrent might also carry
a cost.]{.underline} In order to be effective, then, [a punishment must
carry more weight than the cost of inaction in the challenger's
calculus.]{.underline} The second process, [deterrence by
denia]{.underline}l, [functions by reducing the perceived benefits an
action is expected to provide.]{.underline} [Hardening national or
infrastructural defenses]{.underline} -- what Sir Lawrence Freedman
calls 'passive' defenses -- **[raises the costs of attack by diminishing
the probability that an adversary is likely to acquire ~~his~~ their
objective]{.underline}**. While punishment deters an actor through fear,
denial does so by creating a sense of 'hopelessness' on the part of the
victim.12 [Defense produces similar outcomes but differs from denial
because it seeks to reduce the cost in case deterrence fails rather than
attempt to influence another's behavior.]{.underline} **[The logic upon
which deterrence theory rests is on persuading a target that the costs
of taking an action outweigh the possible benefits the action might
provide]{.underline}**. A **[deterrent is effective when it produces a
cost-benefit calculus in which the expected utility of pursuing a given
action is less than its expected cost]{.underline}**. During the Cold
War and in interstate relations more generally, deterrence was most
actively associated with the threat of retaliation. With the development
and proliferation of nuclear weapons, punishment-based deterrents became
the cornerstone of American (and Russian, Chinese, Israeli, etc.)
deterrent strategies. By the 1960s, Freedman asserts, 'the role of
nuclear weapons' became paramount in restraining state behavior; 'so
long as both sides \[of a contest\] were confident that they could
inflict utter hell on the other, then a wider political equilibrium
would be possible'.13 But [deterrence by punishment, nuclear or
conventional]{.underline}, [represents but a tiny fraction of what is
encapsulated by deterrence logi]{.underline}c. So long as deterrence is
based on manipulating an adversary's behavior, then [nonpunishment based
processes that provide deterrent results]{.underline} **[are necessarily
associated with the logic informing the theory]{.underline}**. Consider
that offers of reward can induce an opponent to change his behavior in
ways that suit a defender. Paul Huth and Bruce Russet contend that
[while 'the inclusion of positive inducements as a means to deter is not
standard practice in academic **writings', its exclusion 'cannot be
justified on grounds of strict logic'**]{.underline}.14
[Rewards]{.underline}, if meant to manipulate behavior, rest [logically
within deterrence theory]{.underline}. In his evaluation of Great Power
credibility in Third World conflicts, Ted Hopf, finds that
**[non-punishment influences played an important role in determining
deterrence successes.]{.underline}** He concludes that deterrence theory
must 'expand its scope to capture an array of deterrent instruments that
the theory's focus on military tools omits'.15 Hence, [while threats are
a central feature of deterrence]{.underline}, [punishment is but a minor
slice of what is theoretically and practically pertinent to constructing
deterrent relations]{.underline} [between actors]{.underline}.
[Non-kinetic deterrents that rely on positive inducements and
reassurance]{.underline}, [denial and mitigation, and debate and
delegitimization,]{.underline} while not generally associated with
deterrence, nonetheless [function and adhere to the theory's core
tenets]{.underline} (changing behavior) and rely on its logical
processes (manipulating cost-benefit calculations). [Non-kinetic
deterrents]{.underline} do not replace traditional ones, but rather
[accompany them into a broader strategy. In]{.underline} asymmetric
[contests between states and terrorist]{.underline}
[adversaries]{.underline}, [these less traditional forms of deterrence
gain a degree of importance.]{.underline}

#### Especially, conventional deterrence theory is true -- risking a war of attrition reduces the risk it will happen in the first place

John J. **Mearsheimer**, 20**17**, "Conventional Deterrence," Cornell
Univeristy Press (John Joseph Mearsheimer is an American political
scientist and international relations scholar, who belongs to the
realist school of thought. He is the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished
Service Professor at the University of Chicago // NC)

Although decision makers constantly analyze the balance between the
perceived political benefits and the potential costs and risks of
military action, the final judgment in this dynamic process determines
whether or not deterrence fails.l38 I have emphasized throughout this
chapter that [deterrence is most likely to obtain when a potential
attacker believes his probability of **success on the battlefield to be
low** and the **attendant costs to be high.**]{.underline} Although
raising both the costs and risks of military action significantly
reduces the likelihood of war, however, it does not guarantee that
deterrence will obtain, simply because the political consequences of
continued peace may be so unacceptable that a nation is tempted to
pursue an unattractive course of action. That is, decision makers must
weigh the political risks of not striking in the balance with the
military risks of striking. 139 Let us examine this matter in greater
detail. [Suppose that the political costs of not going to war are not
great, that although there are compelling reasons to consider war, the
decision makers may yet decide either for or against it. In such a case,
**if the costs and risks of military action are thought to be high,
deterrence is almost certain to obtain.**]{.underline} War is likely to
break out only if the decision makers believe that military action will
be relatively risk free and that the attendant costs will be quite low.
Actually, however, the [political considerations that move a nation
toward war are likely to be much more unyielding in nature, hence the
great pressure brought to bear on the military to find a military
solution]{.underline}. Naturally, if a satisfactory plan is found,
deterrence will almost surely fail. The more interesting question is:
What happens if such a solution is not found? [In this case, the risks
of both military action and continued peace are great. The political
consequences of continued peace might be so unac-ceptable as to tempt a
nation to launch a war it did not expect to win. Such a course of action
is most unlikely, for two reasons. First, how could a nation improve its
position by starting a war it expected to lose]{.underline}? As Bismarck
once noted, the nation would be \"committing suicide from fear of
death.\"I40 [Second, the future is unlikely to seem so hopeless that
suicide is warranted]{.underline}. **[In short, if a nation is certain
that failure awaits it on the battlefield, deterrence is very likely to
obtain]{.underline}**.

#### Deterrence theory is effective as a heuristic despite flaws

Agenda\",

The ﬁrst three waves of [deterrence theory made some signiﬁcant
theoretical contributions not only to the study of deterrence but with
regard to security studies in general]{.underline}. These theories
constituted how scholars thought about deterrence for many years, and in
this way they helped to solidify the realist school of international
relations (Jervis 1979:290--291).5 [Essential inﬂuences of the third
wave can also be seen in the framing of theoretical issues, such as
enduring rivals]{.underline} (Huth and Russett 1993; and compare
Lieberman 1995 with Stein 1996), [conventional deterrence]{.underline}
(Mearsheimer 1983; Shimshoni 1988), extended deterrence (Huth 1988),
[and psychological and cognitive understanding of decision
making]{.underline} (Jervis 1985; Lebow and Stein 1987, 1989; Morgan
2003:134--142, 149--151; see also Levy 1992).6 Furthermore, the
methodological impact of this wave can also be seen (Achen and Snidal
1989:161; Lebow and Stein 1990:346--351), not only in the ﬁeld of
security studies but in international relations and political science as
well (Maoz 2002:172--174; see also King, Keohane, and Verba 1994:24,
134-- 135).¶ The ﬁrst three waves of [**deterrence theory also
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced policymaking**. The un-intuitive implications of
deterrence literature were evident in the strategies and relations of
the superpowers, in particular]{.underline} with regard to the strategy
of [MAD aimed at stabilizing relations between opponents, as
demonstrated in the SALT agreements]{.underline} of 1972 (Adler 1992;
Garthoff 1994:647, 849-- 852; Evangelista 1999). [Deterrence theories
allowed policymakers to organize strategic knowledge into a clear
conceptual framework that was easier to ''sell]{.underline},'' providing
them with strategic language and jargon (Jervis 1979:291; Kaplan
1991:171--172) that included concepts such as massive retaliation,
invulnerability, assured destruction, counterforce, pre-emptive strike,
ﬁrst strike, second strike, and ﬂexible response. While some of these
concepts were not completely new (Quester 1966:1--2; Chilton 1985:115),
they gained inﬂuence primarily in the context of deterrence.¶ Scholars,
mainly of the ﬁrst two waves, based the idea of deterrence upon
apolitical and ahistorical arguments (Jervis 1979:322--323; Kaplan
1991:109; Trachtenberg 1991:40, 44--46), and as a result paid very
little attention to its operation in reality. Ironically, this
obfuscation of empirical contradictions and problems led to the
consensus on its validity.7 As Adler argues, ''because the science of
nuclear strategy has no empirical reference points and data banks, it
cannot be falsiﬁed'' (Adler 1992:107).8 In other words, [**deterrence
could become a heuristic tool, supplying simple, and even simplistic,
solutions to complicated foreign policy problems**. This made it more
attractive than other strategic options to decision makers. Moreover,
the concept of deterrence could force rationality on decision making, so
that deterrence practices became a convincing---and even
justiﬁable---option]{.underline} (Kaplan 1991:72--73; Morgan 2003:13).

Empire and the Globalization of the Westphalian System", August 2015,

Over the last two and a half centuries, [the most important change in
the international political system]{.underline} **[has been the decline
of empire]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} the **[simultaneous spread
of the Westphalian system of sovereign states]{.underline}**, from
Europe to universal global scope. [Empire]{.underline} -- the direct
coercive rule of one people over another -- [has]{.underline} almost
[vanished from world politics]{.underline}. 1 Where once the world was
made up of regional systems -- most of which were empires -- [the
contemporary world is marked by a large number of sovereign
states]{.underline}, now nearly two hundred. 2 Over these centuries, one
state -- [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates -- initially at the periphery of the European
imperial system, [has become the most powerful and influential state in
the system]{.underline}. There are many debates about America in the
international system. One prominent argument developed extensively,
particularly by recent historians, is that the United States is, and has
been throughout its history, imperial and an empire. This view is widely
held by many, both inside and outside the United States. In this view,
the United States continued the Western imperial project as European
empires faltered in the 20th century, and in the second half of the 20th
century created the last and most extensive empire with global reach.3
Arguments along these lines are of more than just of academic interest
because they connect to national identity narratives in many parts of
the world, including the rising states of China and India, which
emphasize anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism, as well as grievances
against Western imperialism.4 In this paper, [we challenge this view and
offer a different account of the American impact on the
world]{.underline} which emphasizes that [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has played a **key
role** in the **decline of empire**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the
[globalization of the]{.underline} [Westphalian system]{.underline}. [In
contrast]{.underline} [to]{.underline} those who view the United States
as an [empire]{.underline}, and thus as essentially antagonistic to the
Westphalian sovereign state system, we argue that [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[in an overall
ledger sheet of impacts,]{.underline}** [has been influential **against
imperialism and colonialism**]{.underline}, and has been powerfully
supportive of the spread of the Westphalian system. We argue that
[contemporary views of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [as imperial]{.underline} **[profoundly
misrepresent]{.underline}** [the overall impact the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has had on
the]{.underline} international [system over the last two and a half
centuries]{.underline}. In this paper, we lay out the evidence for how
the United States has played a major and often decisive role as an
anti-imperial and anti-colonial force. **[More than any other state in
the system]{.underline}**, we argue, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has undermined
empire and spread of the Westphalian system]{.underline}**. Of course,
the decline of empire and the spread of the Westphalian system are the
result of many forces, including the diffusion of military capabilities,
the growth of the international trading system, the rise of nationalism,
and the spread of anti-colonial and human rights norms have all played
powerful roles in diminishing the effectiveness of imperialism and the
attractiveness and longevity of empires.5 But efforts to create
[empires]{.underline} continued well into the 20th century, and their
[lack of success stemmed]{.underline} not just [from]{.underline} these
[broader trends]{.underline} in ideas **[and]{.underline}** power but
also [from the grand strategies of the leading states]{.underline} --
**[most notably the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates -- **[in directly opposing the creation and
perpetuation of empires]{.underline}**. [To be sure, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has been
imperial]{.underline} and briefly had an empire [in some times and
places]{.underline}. **[But these episodes]{.underline}**, we argue,
**[are greatly overshadowed in their overall impact by American
anti-imperialism and anticolonialism]{.underline}**. And the global
spread of the Westphalian system, by no means solely resulting from
American actions, has been more advanced by American foreign policies
than of any other state in the system. There are four broad reasons why
[the American role as anti-imperial]{.underline} and pro Westphalian
**[have been underappreciated.]{.underline}** First, many view the
liberal international order, which the United States has played such a
pivotal role in creating over the 20th century, as a challenge to the
Westphalian system and a replacement for it, rather than an addition to
it. Second, [America's centrality in the globalization of
the]{.underline} Westphalian [system]{.underline} [through]{.underline}
the **[thwarting and dismantlement of empire has been
obscured]{.underline}** [by the widespread tendency to conceive of
Europe and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as **together**
making up "the West]{.underline}."6 [This makes it all too easy to see
Europe's centuries of imperialism being continued by the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. **[In
contrast]{.underline}**, we argue that [a major dynamic in world
politics **has pitted an "old West" of European imperialisms against the
anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism of a "new West" in
America**]{.underline}. Third, [the historical literature on modern
empire building widely]{.underline} [identifies two waves of
activity]{.underline} (the first from the 16th century to the early 19th
century, and the second from the 19th century to the beginning of the
20th). **[We identify two additional waves]{.underline}** of empire
building, [in the World Wars and then in the Cold War]{.underline}. When
these two additional waves are brought back into the picture, [the case
for seeing the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[as anti-imperial and anti-colonial is
significantly strengthened]{.underline}**, [since the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [played such a
prominent role in thwarting and dismantling these late-empire building
efforts]{.underline}. Fourth, [many contemporary observers of America's
impact on the]{.underline} [world]{.underline} [focus on infamous
moments when the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [did
exercise crude imperial behavior]{.underline}: in the many military
interventions and covert actions in Latin America and the Middle East
over the last century and, most saliently, the 2003 American invasion of
Iraq. [We do not seek to ignore]{.underline} or justify [these
episodes]{.underline} and patterns of behavior. [The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has been

#### Epistemology DA wrong---can't the complex hierarchies of Hegemony and empirics proving US power projection

[At the risk of repetition]{.underline}, we term this [the shift to
hegemonic-order theories precisely to, on the one hand, emphasize the
**significance of taking the "order"** part of hegemony studies
seriously]{.underline} and, on the other, signal a break from
deterministic and structuralist understanding of hegemony of the kind
associated with hegemonic-stability and power-transition theories.
[Indeed, the first phase of interstate-hegemony studies failed to
provide theoretically informed understandings of the
architecture]{.underline} and infrastructure [of hegemony. The second
phase started to take]{.underline} that [architecture]{.underline} and
infrastructure [seriously but focused on mechanisms]{.underline} of
stabilization and the variables that accounted for stability. [As we
move into the third phase]{.underline} of interstate-hegemony studies,
[we still lack good ways to link up,]{.underline} for example[, the
study of that architecture, let alone its infrastructure, with
proliferating analyses of how weaker actors oppose or support preeminent
powers. This requires viewing "**hegemonic order,**]{.underline}"
[including in its American guise, as a rich array of relations and
articulated roles and evolving identities, which give hegemony its life
and operation. Seen in this light, the anomalies of hegemonic-stability
theory]{.underline}---such as the failure to identify international
public goods or the inability to provide coherent explanations for why
hegemons might set in motion their own decline---[point to the need to
take seriously this more complex understanding of the internal
architecture of roles, authority relations, and bargains that make up
hegemonic systems]{.underline}. It also calls for a renewed focus on how
hegemonic orders reconfigure the interests and domestic orders of
participants. [This includes not simply weaker actors, but hegemons
themselves. They not only structure international order but find
themselves structured by it. In this sense, hegemonic orders are not
simply a reflection or crystallization of the distribution of power. As
complex hierarchies, hegemonic orders are productive of power and power
relation]{.underline}s.100

**Deterrence is epistemologically verifiable**

Frederick **Kroon 96**, Associate Professor of Philosophy at the
University of Auckland, "Deterrence and the Fragility of Rationality",
Ethics, Vol. 106, No. 2 (Jan., 1996), pp. 350-377, JSTOR

I take it that from the point of view of the early proponents of nuclear
deterrence this would not be a concession of any worth. They didn\'t
just think that nuclear deterrers were doing something that happened to
be rational (and even moral); they thought that in the specified
circumstances nuclear **[deterrers were acting the part of properly
rational agents]{.underline}**, that **[nuclear deterrers were doing
what a fully rational agent would be doing if put in the same difficult
situation, despite the monstrousness of what was
threatened.]{.underline}** Call this kind of position **[an
\"agent-rationalist\" view of nuclear deterrence]{.underline}**. More
precisely, agent-rationalists about nuclear deterrence are those who
think that **[it is not only the act of threatening
retaliation-]{.underline}**in the sense of conditionally intending
it-**[that is fully rational in the specified circumstances; the agent
who threatens retaliation]{.underline}** in these **[circumstances can
also be fully rational, despite the fact that what she threatens to do
is irrational.]{.underline}** The contrary position held by Kavka I call
an \"agent-irrationalist\" view of nuclear deterrence. On such a view,
deterrers must be irrational in some way, perhaps through having
undergone a process of corruption that gives them irrational goals or
makes them unable to understand the full implications of what they
propose.9 (Although I am mainly interested in nuclear deterrence, the
issues, of course, are wider. Thus agent-rationalism and
agentirrationalism can also be understood more broadly as views
concerning the rationality of agents who face \"Special Deterrent
Situations\" in roughly Kavka\'s sense; these situations include our
nuclear scenarios but also many other possible situations of conflict
between agents. While the argument of this article may be general enough
to extend to all such situations, I shall continue to focus on the
nuclear case.)10 In the same way, we may talk of \"agent-moralism\" and
\"agentimmoralism.\" ¶ Thus agent-immoralism about nuclear deterrence
holds that because of the immorality of the retaliatory act, and despite
the moral desirability of the threat, no morally good agent can
seriously threaten retaliation in the nuclear scenarios described.11 Any
agent able to threaten retaliation must have undergone a process of
moral corruption, or be affected in some other way by an element of
moral imperfection in her nature. (This is again Kavka\'s view, but
versions of the view are held by many others; David Lewis, for example.)
¶ These various positions are not, of course, exhaustive. Take
rationality again. Some theorists think that there can be no situation
in which threatening nuclear retaliation is rational.12 If so, no fully
rational agent could be a nuclear deterrer. And in the mid-1980s (but no
longer) David Gauthier held that [because threatening retaliation is
sometimes clearly rational, it would ipso facto be rational in those
cases for a deterrer to act on her retaliatory threats should deterrence
fail. If so, agent-irrationalist arguments can\'t get a toehold, and we
can no longer deny full rationality to nuclear
deterrers**.**]{.underline} While I reject these various positions, they
are not the direct concern of this article. 13 ¶ The debate I am
presently interested in is between agent-rationalists and
agent-irrationalists, agent-moralists and agent-immoralists:
[**philosophical opponents who all accept that threatening (nuclear)
retaliation** can be rational and moral **where acting on the threats is
not.**]{.underline} ¶ In this article I am mainly concerned to defend
agent-rationalism about nuclear deterrence against its irrationalist
critics. That is, my main goal is to show that we can coherently regard
both of the following rationality claims as true: [**not only is the act
of forming and maintaining deterrent conditional intentions** perfectly
rational **in the nuclear circumstances envisaged, but in addition
forming and maintaining such intentions is something that rational
agents are** fully capable of, **despite their knowing that such
intentions, conditionally enjoin an irrational act**]{.underline}. [**I
thereby take myself to be defending nuclear deterrence against an
important and persuasive** philosophical attack on the character of
those running the policy.]{.underline} ¶ By implication, however, I will
also be defending an agent-moralist view of nuclear deterrence and hence
defending deterrence against another kind of attack on the character of
those running the policy. For the moral case turns out to be similar and
in some ways easier. ¶ Although there are conclusive reasons of a moral
kind against applying a nuclear sanction should deterrence fail, I claim
that broadly the same kind of argument can be used to show that a
**[rational and moral agent is]{.underline}** nonetheless **[able to
form and have the relevant conditional intention to apply such a
sanction]{.underline}**. **[And nothing]{.underline}**, as far as I can
see, **[would restrict this conclusion very strongly to certain favored
accounts of morality, such as some version of
consequentialism]{.underline}**. While agentmoralism is not the focus of
this article, I hope to say enough to justify these claims. ¶ **[Why
suppose]{.underline}** for a moment that **[rational agents
cannot]{.underline}** form and **[sustain such deterrent
intentions]{.underline}**? I can think of five more or less seductive
**[arguments]{.underline}** to this effect, some reconstructed from the
literature on the topic, others independently plausible. All **[are
based]{.underline}** directly or indirectly-**[on the content of the
conditional intentions contemplated and on the implications for a
rational agent who contemplates such intentions]{.underline}**. Recall
the problem[**.** Because of what any such intention enjoins, we
allegedly have a circumstance where an agent satisfies the following
conditions**:**]{.underline} P: PI, the agent is (fully) rational; P2,
she conditionally intends to do something E if a certain event C
happens; P3, it is clear to her that if C should happen it would be
irrational to do E. ¶ This triad of conditions appears inconsistent,
however, which suggests that [**no rational agent can have such a
conditional intention in full knowledge of what it involves.** But then
neither]{.underline}, it seems, [can a rational agent form such an
intention in full knowledge of what it involves; deterrence can\'t even
get started unless the deterring agent first becomes
irrational**.**]{.underline} ¶ Different agent-irrationalist arguments
provide different ways of showing how the tension inherent in (P) argues
for agent-irrationality. But before I begin my survey of these
arguments, let me say a bit more about the idea of agent-rationality
itself. The substance of my critique will be that, one way or another,
**[agent-irrationalist arguments variously mislocate or misdescribe
aspects of this idea.]{.underline}** ¶ What follows is supposed to be
uncontentious. [**To describe an agent as rational is to characterize
the agent as** epistemically responsible: **such an agent** responds to
evidence **in the right sort of way,** believing propositions when the
evidence supports them (**but at any rate not when it is cognitively
unsafe to adopt such beliefs) and deciding how to act by taking proper
account of her desires and beliefs** regarding the likely outcome of
actions]{.underline}. This is clearly a dispositional notion, for
**[someone is correctly described as rational to the extent that she is
disposed to function in this way, not just that perchance she always
does function in this way]{.underline}**. But note that **[the
disposition is characterized in terms of]{.underline}** a more **[local
rationality: options open to a person have the property of being
rational if they are supported by her evidence in the right sort of way
or if they reflect her beliefs and desires in the right sort of
way.]{.underline}**

###  AT//Root Cause

Wouldn't you like to find the root cause of that downtime incident? Many
people would. But experience has taught me that **[there is no such
thing as a single root cause]{.underline}**. Instead, [there's a network
of interrelated conditions]{.underline}, [each of which is necessary but
none of which is sufficient to cause the overall problem]{.underline}. I
am often reminded of an outage I was involved in. It was "caused" by a
failed disk. But the disk was in a RAID5 array, so the array shouldn't
have failed. But another disk in that array had failed some time
previously, and RAID5 can tolerate only one failed disk. Backups had
also failed some time previously, so there were no backups. Health
checks didn't notify anyone of the degraded disk array, due to a
misconfigured alerting system. Alerting and backups failed because the
person in charge of operations was not doing their job. The person was
still in charge of operations because of management dysfunction. If you
really want to get to the root cause of a problem, conventional wisdom
says you need to use the Five Whys approach.1 I rarely do that because I
already know where it ends. The CEO or equivalent is always the problem.
It's turtles all the way down (or up). Saying that the CEO is ultimately
responsible is true but useless. The CEO is ultimately responsible for
everything, which isn't a "cause." Five Whys isn't guaranteed to really
move anything forward. That's why **[the search for a root cause is
often a scapegoat-hunt in disguise]{.underline}**, [trying to find
someone or something to blame]{.underline}. If you think there is really
a single cause, **[you eventually must identify a single
person]{.underline}**. [If you stop short of that, everyone knows the
process was a farce]{.underline}. **[But blaming a person is also a
farce]{.underline}**. [Everyone knows that someone's being thrown under
the bus, **which isn't a solution**]{.underline}. There are several
solutions to this dilemma. One is to [stop looking for a single root
cause]{.underline}, and [instead identify the system of conditions or
factors that jointly resulted in the observed system
behavior]{.underline}. This allows something constructive (such as
learning) to come out of the retrospective, instead of inexorably
bringing pressure to bear on a well-meaning person who will then be
sacrificed at the altar of reductionist blame-gaming.

Mid-twentieth-century hegemonic-order studies generally assumed that the
hegemon's security provision was a one-way benefit for allies, which
could free ride and reap the benefits of being a trading state. [This
public-good logic is not wrong, but it is hardly the only game in town.
It ignores countervailing dynamics inside the security
network]{.underline} [that present the leading actor with opportunities
to defray the costs of protection]{.underline}. [Even if the good is
public, and allies could in]{.underline} principle [enjoy]{.underline}
security [benefits without contributing,]{.underline} [**allies have

incentivizing them to cooperate on security and economic
affairs.]{.underline} The more their interests align with the dominant
actor, the more valuable their connection and the more prepared they
will be to prolong the prevailing distribution of power and offer
support when needed. [Providing a **secure international environment**

## Deterrence DA 

### 2AC---Deterrence Fails 

#### Deterrence fails -- multipolarity, increasing conventional military capabilities, and non-state actors muddles the waters

Deterrence\", Hudson Institute, 7-5-2017,

and Budgetary Assessments.) //bc

Since the end of World War II, the United States has relied on
deterrence as the centerpiece of its defense strategy. This emphasis
endures in the Trump administration's National Security Strategy and
National Defense Strategy. Yet as this study shows, the **[strategic
environment in which deterrence must function has changed
dramatically]{.underline}**, [and continues changing]{.underline}.
Moreover, [some lessons that we thought had emerged from our Cold War
experience regarding the robustness of deterrence strategies have proven
false.]{.underline} Similarly, [some critical assumptions regarding how
rationally humans behave when making decisions under conditions of risk
have been overturned by advances in the cognitive and behavioral
sciences]{.underline}. Deterrence involves efforts to prevent a
competitor (the object or "target") from pursuing a proscribed action.
Those employing deterrence seek to influence the target's calculation of
the costs, benefits, and risks associated with pursuing the proscribed
action. Assuming a rational target, deterrence works by convincing the
rival that it has an unacceptably low probability of achieving its goals
(deterrence through denial) or that the costs involved in pursuing the
proscribed action will exceed any benefits derived (deterrence through
punishment). While it cannot be proven that strategies based on
deterrence have maintained the general peace for the past three-quarters
of a century, there is strong circumstantial evidence supporting this.
In particular, the introduction of nuclear weapons, with their immense
destructive power, combined with the development of other increasingly
capable weapons, has raised the prospective costs of war to such high
levels that waging it is an increasingly unattractive proposition for
"rational" policymakers who seek to maximize their overall anticipated
gains and minimize projected costs. That said, **[the international
system is entering a new, more contentious era]{.underline}**. [The
"unipolar era" that followed the Cold War and that saw the United States
enjoy a rare period of singular military dominance has passed into
history]{.underline}. Not only is [military power]{.underline} becoming
more diffused, thanks to the introduction of new kinds of military
capability; it [is also becoming increasingly
multidimensional]{.underline}. Moreover, [military competitions
have]{.underline} [expanded progressively into new parts of the globe
and new domains to include space, cyberspace, and the
seabed]{.underline}. Given these and other ongoing changes in the
international security environment, it seems fair to ask: Will
strategies relying primarily on deterrence prove as effective in the
coming years as they did during the Cold War and unipolar eras? This
study finds that [changes in the geopolitical and military-technical
environments are eroding the effectiveness of strategies based on
deterrence]{.underline}. Moreover, relatively [recent revelations of
Cold War history]{.underline} and advances in the behavioral sciences
**[raise important concerns regarding our understanding of how
deterrence has worked in the past, as well as its limitations going
forward.]{.underline}** In brief, the efficacy of deterrence is being
challenged across multiple fronts. [**The Shifting Geopolitical**
Environment The United States confronts an international security system
which,]{.underline} unlike the system between 1945 and the present,
[is]{.underline} not bipolar or unipolar, but [multipolar]{.underline}.
The emergence of major revisionist great powers in [China and
Russia]{.underline}, [combined with the proliferation of nuclear weapons
and other advanced military capabilities to second-tier powers, **has
increased the number of rivals the United States seeks to
deter,**]{.underline} [providing more opportunities for deterrence to
fail]{.underline}. With respect to nuclear weapons, the radical
[reductions in U.S. and Russian Cold War nuclear arsenals, combined with
the growth in Chinese, Indian, and Pakistani arsenals**, is
progressively shifting the competitive environment from the bipolar Cold
War framework to a multipolar system.**]{.underline} Consequently, [some
nuclear postures that contributed to stability during the Cold
War]{.underline}---such as "parity"---[may be problematic or even
impossible to achieve]{.underline}. The [geopolitical environment is
also considerably more dynamic than either the Cold War system or the
U.S.-dominated unipolar system]{.underline} that followed it. [This
makes rapid]{.underline}---and potentially highly
destabilizing---[shifts in geopolitical alignments]{.underline} and the
military balance relatively more [likely]{.underline}, [presenting
additional challenges to executing strategies relying primarily on
deterrence.]{.underline} A Multidimensional Strategic Military
Competition [Conventional weapons have become increasingly
precise]{.underline}, capable of effectively striking some targets once
reserved solely for nuclear weapons. [Advances in their design have
enabled the fielding of increasingly discriminate weapons.]{.underline}
Thus **[the clear distinction that existed for most of the Cold War
between conventional and nuclear weapons has become progressively
blurred]{.underline}**. Yet despite this trend, a significant number of
Western political leaders believe nuclear weapons' only use is to deter
others from employing nuclear weapons. This perceived decoupling could
lower the perceived risks of waging conventional war. On the other hand,
some civilian and military leaders in countries like China and Russia
assert that certain types of nuclear weapons are, in some cases,
available for use in a major conventional war. [Deterrence]{.underline}
[may be compromised if Western leaders see the risks that nuclear
weapons will be employed in a conventional war as minimal]{.underline},
[while the Chinese and Russians view these weapons as available for
use.]{.underline} The introduction of [cyberweapons]{.underline}, with
their enormous but untested potential, [has further muddied the
deterrence waters.]{.underline} Insofar as cyberweapons reduce senior
decision-makers' confidence in their early warning and
command-and-control (C2) systems, [they may be compelled to delegate
nuclear]{.underline} (or strategic) [force release authority to
subordinate commanders]{.underline}, increasing substantially the number
of individuals who can authorize a strategic attack. [If even one of
these individuals is more risk tolerant than their senior
decision-maker]{.underline}([s]{.underline}), [deterrence will be
weakened.]{.underline} If the prospective attacker's decision-makers
believe the effectiveness of a rival's early warning and C2 systems is
significantly compromised, this would logically reduce the anticipated
costs (and risks) of executing a surprise attack during a crisis, all
other factors being equal. If so, the efficacy of deterrence would be
diminish[ed. The uncertainty over the relative value and effectiveness
of these military capabilities]{.underline} is **[further complicated by
the long absence of war between major military powers,]{.underline}**
**[which provides the ultimate test of military systems]{.underline}**,
force structures, and the doctrines governing their employment. As time
passes, [uncertainty increases with respect to the true nuclear,
conventional, and cyber military balances]{.underline} and their
interrelationships. The introduction of new capabilities will complicate
matters even further. This heightens the chances that prospective
belligerents will reach significantly different conclusions about the
true military balance and, by extension, the risks of pursuing a
proscribed course of action. Proximity and Speed of Attack [The decline
in the efficacy of deterrence is also a consequence of
geography]{.underline}. **[The proliferation of nuclear and other
strategic weapons to states in relatively close proximity]{.underline}**
to one another [is significantly reducing attack warning
times]{.underline} compared to those that existed between the United
States and Soviet Russia during most of the Cold War. Under such
conditions, some senior policymakers may feel they need to place their
strategic forces on "hair-trigger" alert in a crisis. [The incentive to
devolve release authority for strategic forces to lower-level commanders
would also likely increase]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} could
enhance deterrence, but it [would]{.underline} also [increase the risk
of accidental or unauthorized use of strategic forces]{.underline}.
Expansion in New Domains [The expansion of military competition in the
relatively new domains of space, cyberspace, and the seabed]{.underline}
**[finds a growing number of state and non-state rivals competing for
advantage.]{.underline}** In each domain, **[the competition favors the
offense.]{.underline}** [This undermines deterrence through
denial]{.underline} since, all other factors being equal, [the costs
associated with taking a proscribed action]{.underline} [are less than
those needed to block the action successfully]{.underline}. In each
domain, identifying the source of an attack---especially promptly---is
relatively difficult compared to large-scale attacks in more traditional
warfighting domains, such as land, air, and sea. This lowers the risk
associated with pursuing a proscribed action in these domains and, in so
doing, incentivizes risk-tolerant actors, eroding the efficacy of
deterrence through punishment. The Democratization of Destruction The
rapidly [increasing ability of non-state entities to inflict large-scale
destruction also undermines deterrence]{.underline}, as some groups,
like millenarian groups, simply wish to inflict destruction---to "watch
the world burn." In such cases, [deterrence through denial is the only
possible strategy,]{.underline} as **[deterrence through the threat of
punishment would matter little to those who are
willing]{.underline}**---even eager---[to give their lives to achieve
their aims]{.underline}. Indeed, [non-state groups]{.underline} [have
little,]{.underline} if anything, [in the way of economic infrastructure
and population against which to retaliate.]{.underline} The Human
Condition Over the past forty years, advances by scholars in the
cognitive and behavioral sciences find that **[human beings cannot be
counted on to act rationally in making decisions where risk is
involved]{.underline}**. Research also finds that [there are impediments
to our ability to understand how rivals calculate cost, benefit, and
risk]{.underline}. Some of these impediments, especially those created
by a cultural divide, may prove difficult, if not impossible, to bridge.
[Those creating deterrence strategies can derive some comfort from
prospect theory]{.underline}, which shows that [people are generally
less willing to take risks to acquire what they do not have than to
preserve that which is theirs]{.underline}. Alas, all too often, [both
rivals view themselves as in a "domain of loss,"]{.underline} **[and are
thus willing to run relatively high risks in order to
prevail]{.underline}**. Of course, the more risk tolerant an adversary
is, the more difficult that adversary is to deter. [Optimism
bias]{.underline}, which appears to be prevalent among political
leaders[, can lead them to discount the dangers of pursuing risky
courses of action and to "double down" when things go
badly]{.underline}, as opposed to cutting their losses. Again, **[a bias
toward resolving uncertainty in one's favor increases a decision-maker's
anticipated gains, reduces prospective losses, and/or diminishes the
projected risks in pursuing a proscribed course of
action]{.underline}**. All work to undermine deterrence. The need to be
treated "fairly" and "honorably" can also skew a decision-maker's
"rational" calculations of cost, benefit, and risk. This can find
political leaders rejecting "win-win" deals in favor of "lose-lose"
outcomes, further complicating the challenges involved in crafting
effective deterrence strategies.

This article sought to evaluate the current standing of deterrence
theory. This was done through an examination of several important topics
in deterrence theory. Contrary to Morgan,119 [there are two main
theories of deterrence: classical deterrence theory and perfect
deterrence theory.]{.underline} While both are rational-choice theories,
they differ in several respects, particularly regarding their treatment
of credibility. [Classical deterrence theory assumes that conflict is
the worst possible outcome for both sides, meaning that no retaliatory
threats are credible]{.underline}. [**However, this assumption leads
directly to the paradox of mutual deterrence**, wherein classical theory
is unable to explain deterrence success]{.underline}. The paradox of
mutual deterrence is solved by [perfect deterrence theory,]{.underline}
which [argues that the credibility of a state\'s threat depends upon its
preference between backing down and conflict]{.underline}. Therefore,
[**scholars need to move away from the assumption that conflict is the
worst possible outcome**. By doing so]{.underline}, [Zagare and Kilgour
are able to develop a logically consistent theory]{.underline} of
general deterrence [that]{.underline} usefully [explains the dynamics of
deterrence in mutual, unilateral, and extended deterrence
situations]{.underline}.120 Although the distinction between classical
and perfect deterrence theories is stark, this distinction - or at least
the challenge of perfect deterrence theory - is often ignored. For
example, although Morgan argues that there is only one deterrence
theory, in his list of \'standard works on deterrence theory\' any
reference to perfect deterrence theory is conspicuously absent.121
Similarly, although Sartori allows the defender\'s preference between
war and backing down to vary in her game-theoretic model, she makes no
reference to the work of Zagare or perfect deterrence theory - which is
where the idea of variable threat credibility comes from - but instead
relates her work to classical deterrence theorists such as Schelling and
Powell.122 More examples could be provided, but the theme is consistent.
The contrast between the two theories is not simply a matter of
differences over assumptions and abstract theoretical issues. The policy
recommendations of perfect deterrence theory and classical deterrence
theory are diametrically opposed on many issues.123 For example,
classical deterrence theory argues that national missile defence
undermines the stability of deterrence,124 whereas an application of
perfect deterrence theory demonstrates that national missile defence can
enhance deterrence stability.125 However, [**policy discussions in
academia and government are generally based on classical deterrence
theory.** Given its strong empirical support, coupled with logical and
empirical limitations of classical deterrence theory, perfect deterrence
theory provides a much better basis for analysing various aspects of
national security polic]{.underline}y Clearly, classical deterrence
theory constitutes the \'conventional wisdom\' regarding deterrence.
Nonetheless, [classical deterrence theory is badly flawed]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} (unnecessarily restrictive) **[assumption that
conflict is always the worst possible outcome needs to be
discarded]{.underline}**. It has not proven useful for developing
logically consistent and empirically accurate theory. By contrast,
perfect deterrence theory provides a logically consistent alternative to
understand the dynamics of deter rence. Therefore, perfect deterrence
theory provides the most appropriate basis for further theoretical
development, empirical testing, and application to policy

Arms Sales Provide Little Direct Benefit to U.S. National Security

At the strategic level[, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[inhabits]{.underline} such [an]{.underline} extremely [favorable
security]{.underline} [environment]{.underline} in the post-Cold War
world [that most arms sales do little or nothing to improve its
security.]{.underline} Thanks to its geography, friendly (and weak)
neighbors, large and dynamic economy, and secure nuclear arsenal, the
United States faces very few significant threats[. There is no Soviet
Union bent upon dominating Europe and destroying the United States.
China,]{.underline} despite its rapid rise, [cannot]{.underline} (and
has no reason to) [challenge the sovereignty or territorial integrity of
the United States. Arms sales --- to allies or others]{.underline} ---
[**are unnecessary to deter major,** direct threats to U.S. national
security in the current era]{.underline}.47 [Nor are arms sales
necessary to protect the United States from "falling
dominoes,"]{.underline} or the consequences of conflicts elsewhere. The
United States enjoys what Eric Nordlinger called "strategic immunity."48
Simply put, most of what happens in the rest of the world is irrelevant
to U.S. national security. The United States has spent decades helping
South Korea keep North Korea in check, for example, but division of
territory on the Korean peninsula does not affect America's security.
[Likewise, civil wars in the Middle East and Russia's annexation of
Crimea might be significant]{.underline} for many reasons[, but those
events do not **threaten the ability** of the United States to defend
itself.]{.underline} As a result, [a decision to sell weapons
to]{.underline} Ukraine, Taiwan, or South Korea [could significantly
affect those nations' security**; doing so is not an act of ensuring**
U.S. national **security.** Nor does the threat of transnational
terrorism justify most arms sales.]{.underline} Most fundamentally, the
actual threat from Islamist-inspired terrorism to Americans is
extraordinarily low. [Since 9/11, neither al Qaeda nor the Islamic State
has managed an attack on the American homeland. Lone wolf terrorists
inspired by those groups have done so, but since 9/11 those attacks have
killed fewer than 100 Americans]{.underline}, an average of about 6
people per year. [There is simply very little risk reduction to be
gained from any strategy. The idea]{.underline} that [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should be willing to accept
the significant negative effects of arms sales for minimal
counterterrorism gains is seriously misguided]{.underline}.49 [Moreover,
even if one believed that the benefits would outweigh the potential
costs,]{.underline} [arms sales still have almost **no value** as a tool
in the war on terror for several reasons]{.underline}.
[First,]{.underline} the [bulk]{.underline} of [arms sales]{.underline}
(and those we considered in our risk assessment) [involve major
conventional weapons,]{.underline} which are **[ill suited to combatting
terrorism.]{.underline}** Many U.S. arms deals since 9/11 have involved
major conventional weapons systems such as fighter jets, missiles, and
artillery, useful for traditional military operations, but of little use
in fighting terrorists. [Insurgencies]{.underline} that [hold
territory,]{.underline} like the Islamic State, are one thing, [but most
terrorist groups do not advertise their location, nor do they assemble
in large groups.]{.underline}

###  AT//Terrorism DA 

#### Arms sales increase terrorism

[Second]{.underline}, there is [little evidence from the past 16 years
that direct military intervention is the right way to combat terrorism.
Research reveals that military force alone "seldom ends
terrorism]{.underline}."50 This comports with the American experience in
Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere in the war on terror to date. [Despite
regime change, thousands of air strikes, and efforts to upgrade the
military capabilities of friendly governments, the United States has not
only failed to destroy the threat of Islamist-inspired terrorism, it has
also spawned chaos, greater resentment, **and a sharp increase in the
level of terrorism afflicting the nations involved**]{.underline}.51
Given the experience of the United States since 2001[, there is little
reason to expect that additional arms sales to countries like Saudi
Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar, or the United Arab Emirates will reduce
terroris]{.underline}m, much less anti-American terrorism specifically.
Relatedly, many arms deals since 9/11, made in the name of
counterterrorism, were irrelevant to U.S. goals in the global war on
terror because they provided weapons to governments fighting terrorist
groups only vaguely (if at all) linked to al Qaeda or ISIS. [Although
selling weapons to the governments of Nigeria or Morocco or Tunisia
might help them combat violent resistance in their countries, terrorist
groups in those countries have never targeted the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. [As a result, such arms deals cannot be justified
by arguing that they advance the goals of the United States in its own
war on terror in any serious way.]{.underline}

### 2AC---Deterrence Not Falsifiable 

#### Deterrence theory is *[non-falsifiable]{.underline}* rather it increases the risk of conflict 

Robert P **Haffa** Jr., 20**18**, "The Future of Conventional
Deterrence: Strategies for Great Power Competition," Strategic Studies
Quarterly, (Dr. Haffa holds a BS in international affairs from the U.S.
Air Force Academy, an MA in government from Georgetown University, and a
Ph.D, in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. He is the author of two books and numerous articles on
American defense policy. // NC)

In either case, however, and despite the richness of this body of
theory, classic formulations of deterrence, even in the purest of
strategic nuclear deterrence situations, have encountered considerable
criticism. The most significant claims follow. Uncertainty. **[Although
it can be argued that nuclear deterrence worked during the Cold War, we
do not know that for sure]{.underline}**. [It is very difficult to prove
deterrent successes because that would require showing why an event did
not occur.]{.underline} There is inherent uncertainty about the
antecedent causes one cites in such cases, as other plausible factors
can always be suggested. Rationality. **[The emphasis on the rational
calculation of the cost of a retaliatory response has also been faulted
in deterrence theory.]{.underline}** [Decision makers who start wars may
pay more attention to their own domestic needs]{.underline} or to other
internal or external factors [than to the military capabilities or
options of their possible adversaries]{.underline} or to the potential
severity of the outcome. Stability. **[Deterrence theory has also been
criticized for contributing to a spiral of conflict]{.underline}**. [The
threat of retaliation may be so great and so destabilizing that, in
times of crisis, it becomes in the aggressor's interest to preempt or
escalate.]{.underline} Failure. [Deterrence at conventional levels has
tended to "fail.]{.underline}" However, proponents of conventional
deterrence argue that the use of conventional military force does not
necessarily equate to a failure of doctrine. Deterrence failures are not
inconsistent with deterrence theory, provided they can be attributed to
the absence of a clear commitment or to insufficient capability or
credibility. [On the other hand, because the risks of conventional
conflict could be perceived as relatively modest, the costs of choosing
to go to conventional war, even if the likelihood of attaining a
military victory is granted little confidence,]{.underline} might be
outweighed by perceived political benefits.9

### 2AC---Epistemology Flawed

#### Traditional models based on individual models of exports and imports fail to understand the *[dynamic network]{.underline}* of security and cooperation 

Paul W. **Thurner** et al, 08-29-**18**, *Network Interdependencies and
the Evolution of the International Arms Trade*, Journal of conflict
resolution, <https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002718801965> (Paul Thurner:

University, Skyler J. Crammer: Department of political science, The Ohio
State University, Goran Kauermann: Department of Statistics, Ludwig
Maximillians University Munich // NC)

Much of the [literature on arms trade is based on historical
analyses]{.underline} (Harkavy 1975; Krause 1992), [case
studies]{.underline} (Kolodziej 1987; Gill 1992), [and descriptive
analyses of arms exportation to developing states]{.underline} (Leiss et
al. 1970; Brzoska and Ohlson 1987). The field achieved important
progress in theory building when Levine, Somnath, and Smith (1994)
introduced an economic model of buying countries, selling countries, and
companies within the selling states. [This supply and demand model
conceives of arms trade as an imperfect market where only a few
countries are able to develop advanced military
technologies.]{.underline} The oligopolistic structure in the post-WWII
period has been evident for the informed observer. [However, its dynamic
emergence and persistence continue to be a puzzle. The structure was
created and perpetuated by strong governmental intervention and
regulation, research and development subsidies, support via domestic
procurement, and export promotions. Thus, market entry based on
autochthonously developed products proved to be extremely difficult for
other countries. From the perspective of the importing countries, the
need for interoperable components, long-term maintenance contracts, and
customization of the military personnel led to a strong adherence to one
or few supply country/countries. This market is peculiar as transactions
are not always compensated by regular payment. Contracts can also
specify price reductions, loans, offsets, military aid, or even barter
deals.]{.underline} In order [to capture these specificities, the
model]{.underline} proposed by Levine, Somnath, and Smith (1994)
[includes two arguments in the objective function of
governments]{.underline}: [supply countries simultaneously maximize
economic returns and minimize future negative security externalities
from weapon sales]{.underline}. The importing countries maximize
security by building up weapon stock piles while minimizing economic
strains. Currently, it is completely unclear how this presumed
optimization process is carried out in reality. [Especially with regard
to the hypothesized economics versus security trade-off for supplier
countries, **it would be essential to quantify this relationship.**
However, **there are no empirical results on this aspect of arms
trade.**]{.underline} Overall, [the quantitative literature]{.underline}
on arms trade is quite small and [has tended to focus either on
importing]{.underline} (Pearson 1989; Smith and Tasiran 2005) [or
exporting]{.underline} (Blanton 2005; Perkins and Neumayer 2010)
countries. **[Few studies have attempted to integrate the two
perspectives in an encompassing network study design]{.underline}**. As
of this writing, exactly two studies have considered the network
structure of international arms trade at the global level. Akerman and
Seim (2014) were the first to propose a network perspective for
visualizing the transfers of major conventional weapons (MCWs) and to
provide a descriptive analysis for the period 1950 to 2007. Their
estimation approach covers the period 1962 to 2000 and is based on a
gravity model including gross domestic product (GDP) per capita,
geographic distance, and regime similarity. The authors use a pooled
linear probability model with countryfixed effects to explain the binary
occurrence of trade relations between two countries. A main result is
that the "implied relative likelihood of trade" was conditional on
regime dissimilarity during the Cold War, but not after the dissolution
of the USSR. Note that this study assumes dyadic independence, that is,
all dyads are independent, including those involving the same country. A
recent article (Kinne 2016) comes closest to treating arms trade as a
network and relaxing the dyadic independence assumption by accounting
for dependence structures beyond dyads. The author runs a stochastic
actor-oriented model (Snijders 2002) for the recent period 1995 to 2010.
He uses a two-stage estimation model in which the formation of weapons
cooperation agreements is captured in the first stage. The second stage
explains volumes of arms transfer activities (being transformed into
rank orders) of a given country i, where activities are defined as the
sum of exports and imports of a specific country under consideration.
Explanatory covariates of this equation are limited to attributes of the
respective country. [A major finding of this article is that **weapons
cooperation agreements and weapons trade are strongly interrelated.**
Despite contributing valuable theoretical and empirical insights into
international arms trade, **the existing literature has yet to treat it
as a dynamic network**. Importantly, we lack a proper network theory of
arms trade. We also need empirical evidence on genuine network
effects]{.underline}, on changes of effects over time in a true Thurner
et al. 1739 dynamic modeling approach, and on the predictive power of
the implemented models. This is what we intend to provide in this
article using a TERGM approach

#### IR Theory relies on a false conception of temporal homogeneity -- specifically in the context of arms sales, *[inconsistencies in history]{.underline}* means overarching realist models of analysis are inevitably tied to *[confirmation biases]{.underline}*

[The study of the international arms trade has relied almost exclusively
on exogenous predictors and the assumptions that dyadic relationships
are independent from one another. We have taken the position
that]{.underline} **[independence of observations is an unreasonable
assumption]{.underline}**, implying that the arms trade process may only
be understood as a network and that processes endogenous to that network
are instrumental to its evolution. Here, we have put forward [a
network-based theory of arms trade decisions]{.underline}. Our theory
[integrates the market forces acting upon exporters and importers as
well as the strategic security considerations]{.underline} can oppose
those market forces. The network-based approach has allowed us to
integrate these perspectives both theoretically and empirically to
produce a systemic model of arms trade. [Our results,]{.underline} taken
together[, demonstrate that not only are the previously ignored
endogenous processes on which we focus relevant for the arms trade
network process, **but predominantly so.**]{.underline} With the
exception of reciprocity, each of the endogenous determinants of the
network provides substantively important, statistically reliable, and
predictively valuable results. [Our results show that analyses of arms
trade activity that omit endogenous determinants of the network's
structure **cannot hope to be free of omitted variable
bias.**]{.underline} Our analysis also illuminates the inherent tension
between economic and security forces in the data generating process. We
reveal the relative impact of economic versus security incentives as
specified in formal models of international arms trade. [It turns out
that alliances continue to be a major determinant of arms
exchange]{.underline} despite a remarkable temporary decrease in the
1990s. Taking the market size of the importer (GDP) as a proxy for the
economic incentive to export, we cannot identify an important increase
of this criterion in exporters' decision-making after the Cold War. [A
systematic comparison of the estimated value trade-off supports this
result. However, we do find evidence of a temporary relaxation of the
security criterion---at least until 2001, when strategic considerations
regain relative importance. Thus, it seems that 9/11 could have played a
decisive role in the restructuring of a new international order in arms
trade]{.underline}. Our study also raised a methodological issue with
implications for the study of international politics reaching far beyond
arms trade: each of the effects included in [our model exhibited a
**dramatic degree of temporal heterogeneity with respect to the strength
and even direction of effects**. It is common practice in international
relations scholarship to pool over long periods of time, often hundreds
of years. Our study has shown that **it is unrealistic to expect the
sort of temporal stability required for such analyses with respect to
arms trade**]{.underline}. [Conceiving of arms trade as a network
phenomenon represents a fundamental departure from established
scholarship on the topic. This holistic approach is able to unify the
arms trade literature, both theoretically and empirically, while making
more credible assumptions about the nature of the data generating
process.]{.underline}

### 2AC---Power Projection Bad

#### Efforts of extended deterrence only incentivizes an action reaction spiral of *[defensive projection]{.underline}* that leads to more wars 

Bradley S. **Klein**, 19**88**, "Hegemony and Strategic Culture:
American Power Projection and Alliance Defence Politics," Review of
International Studies,

(PhD in Political Science // NC)

Briefly stated, there are three kinds of dilemmas to which extended
deterrence has given rise. The first concerns the economics of burden
sharing: paying for extended deterrence. Post-war reconstruction has
worked, perhaps too well, and the United States finds itself balancing
economic co-operation with economic competition: renewed competition
with those very states which it helped rebuild and with whom it had
erected a co-operative multilateral framework. Thus we witness mounting
pressures for the Allies to assume a greater share of defence spending,
and these efforts at prodding are accompanied by more aggressive
pressures exercised through the Mansfield and Nunn Amendments and
related attempts to get the Nakasone government in Japan to commit
itself to more than 1 per cent of GNP in defence appropriations. [The
imbalances created by the loss of American economic power have now
required the United States to pay for its overseas adventures and
military budget by two means which it had been able to avoid in the era
of dominance: massive budget deficits, and effective taxation of its
allies through high interest rates that siphon their investment capital
into the United States]{.underline}. The second dilemma generated by
[extended deterrence concerns uneasiness by the Allies over their
subordinate status]{.underline} and over the ambiguous character of this
sub ordination[. On the one hand, the credibility of deterrence strategy
for the West European NATO partners depends upon American security
guarantees]{.underline}. This relationship is entirely a political one,
just as the issue of possible decoupling led to the deployment in Europe
of cruise and Pershing II missiles as political symbols of America\'s
commitment. [On the other hand, however, this strategic subordination
entails restraints imposed upon European sovereignty as its fate is tied
to decisions made in Washington. Thus the uneasiness about American
interventionism for fear of its implicating the Continent in a war whose
origins lie outside Europ]{.underline}e: for instance, the case of Libya
in the spring of 1986, when the continental NATO lands refused both
diplomatic and military support for the aerial raid upon Tripoli. This
tension between Western Europe and the United States is exacerbated as
the Allies exercise various political strategies of
d?tente?\'Ostpolitik\', visits to Moscow, the gas pipeline, the Helsinki
human rights accords and express a distinct uneasiness over the newer
strategies of US power projection, including SDI and Air-Land Battle for
NATO. The third dilemma engendered by extended deterrence has to do with
the way in which America\'s strategic culture of technological
innovation and war fighting strategies replete, perhaps, with defensive
shields exacerbates European insecurity by deepening antagonisms with
the Soviet Union. [Soviet strategic culture has for historical reasons
become acutely sensitive to (renewed) interventionism from Western
powers**. In response it has devised a strategic culture of what might
be called \'defensive projection\'**]{.underline}: [the establishment of
a protective East European glacis on its western border]{.underline} and
a Warsaw Pact strategy designed to launch an immediate counter-offensive
westward [should NATO initiate war]{.underline}.29 [This politically
defensive]{.underline} but none the less militarily ominous, indeed,
offensive [strategy has]{.underline}, in conjunction with
American-sponsored strategies, [created a mutually interactive arms race
based upon the dual preparation for war-fighting]{.underline}. At the
European level this has meant the division and dual occupation of the
Continent and its transformation into the most heavily militarized
region on earth. As a result, Europe\'s security [increasingly
resides]{.underline} not in political co-operation but [in a kind of
strategic stand-off in which weapons systems and foreign divisions face
one another and create a modicum of peace. The ensuing militarization of
the Continent has a subtly corrosive effect on the integral hegemony of
post-war stabilization.]{.underline} While post-war relations between
the Atlantic Community and the Third World were always based upon the
manifest coercion of [Western military force and the support of
dictatorial \'modernizing\' regimes, relations among the advanced
industrial societies were]{.underline} always [predicated
on]{.underline} the combined fruits of [economic reconstruction and the
absence of]{.underline} those generalized [wars which had long-wracked
the Continent]{.underline}. [This was the promise of extended
deterrence]{.underline}: to consolidate order among the advanced
capitalist states; to fend off socialist incursions, and under the guise
of flexible response and developmental assistance to eradicate
opposition at the periphery. [This is why even social democrats had to
tolerate American interventionism]{.underline}. France, unwilling to
trust the United States to patrol French strategic interests, took these
tasks upon itself, both through its \'force de frappe\' and through its
conspicuous military presence in North and West Africa. [But with the
proliferation of Third World post-colonial and anti-imperialist wars
since the end of the Second World War]{.underline}, and with the
determined Soviet effort to catch up with the United States, [the result
has been something far different than that foreseen by the
architects]{.underline} [of]{.underline} extended
[deterrence.]{.underline} **[The strategies of stabilization have not
worked. The result is the growing incidence of wars, a steady rise in
military expenditures world-wide as a percentage of gross national
product, the spread of military regimes throughout the Third World and
into NATO itself]{.underline}** (in the form, first, of Franco\'s Spain,
then Greece and now Turkey), **[and mounting pressures upon the
Europeans, both East and West, to go along with the superpowers in
programmes of rearmament]{.underline}**.30 The integral organic
**[hegemony of the post-war era is thereby gradually being tightened up
and subjected to the domesticating pressures of political-military
integration]{.underline}**

## Hegemony Fails 

### Fettweis 

#### Hegemony is a wish-wash theory that provides no evidence to providing peace---psychology prove their authors over-exaggerate hegemonic stability and peace will still exist regardless if hegemony collapses 

**Fettweis 17**---Christopher J. Fettweis, Associate Professor of
Political Science at Tulane University, "Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the
New Peace", *Security Studies, 26:3, 423-451*, Taylor and Francis
Online, May 8, 2017//Lee

[Both strains of the hegemonic-stability]{.underline} explanation
[assume not only that US power is benevolent, but that others perceive
it that way. Hegemonic stability depends on]{.underline} the
[perceptions]{.underline} of other states [to be
successful;]{.underline} it has no hope to succeed if it encounters
resistance from the less powerful members of the system, or even if they
simply refuse to follow the rules. Relatively small police forces
require the general cooperation of large communities to have any chance
of establishing order. [They must perceive the sheriff as just,
rational, and essentially nonthreatening. The lack of balancing behavior
in the system,]{.underline} which has been puzzling to many realists,
[seems to support the notion of widespread perceptions of benevolent
hegemony]{.underline}.101 [Were they threatened by]{.underline} the
order constructed by [the United States,]{.underline} the argument goes,
smaller states would react in ways that reflected their fears. Since
internal and external balancing accompanied previous attempts to achieve
hegemony, the absence of such behavior today suggests that something is
different about the US version. [Hegemonic-stability theorists purport
to understand the perceptions of others, at times better than those
others understand themselves.]{.underline} Complain as they may at
times, other countries know that the United States is acting in the
common interest. [Objections to unipolarity, though widespread, are not
"very seriously intended," wrote Kagan,]{.underline} since "the truth
about America's dominant role in the world is known to most observers[.
And the truth is that th]{.underline}e [benevolent hegemony exercised by
the United States is good for a vast portion of the world's
population.]{.underline}" 102 In the 1990s, Russian protests regarding
NATO expansion---though nearly universal---were not taken seriously,
since US planners believed the alliance's benevolent intentions were
apparent to all. Sagacious Russians understood that expansion would
actually be beneficial, since it would bring stability to their western
border.103 President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher
were caught off guard by the hostility of their counterparts regarding
the issue at a summit in Budapest in December 1994.104 Despite warnings
from the vast majority of academic and policy experts about the likely
Russian reaction and overall wisdom of expansion itself, the
administration failed to anticipate Moscow's position.105 The Russians
did not seem to believe American assurances that expansion would
actually be good for them. [The United States overestimated the degree
to which others saw it as benevolent]{.underline}. Once again, [the
culture of the United States might make its leaders more **vulnerable**
to this misperception. The need for positive self-regard appears to be
particularly strong in North American societies]{.underline} compared to
elsewhere.106 Western egos tend to be gratified through self-promotion
rather than humility, and independence rather than interdependence.
[Americans are more likely to feel good if they are unique rather than a
good cog in society's wheel, and uniquely good]{.underline}. The need to
be perceived as benevolent, though universal, may well exert stronger
encouragement for US observers to project their perceptions onto others.
[The United States almost certainly frightens others more than its
leaders perceive]{.underline}. A quarter of the 68,000 respondents to a
2013 Gallup poll in [sixty-five countries identified the **U**nited
**S**tates as the **"greatest threat to world peace**,]{.underline}"
which was [more than three times the total]{.underline} for the
second-place country ([Pakistan]{.underline}).107 The international
community always has to worry about the potential for police brutality,
even if it occurs rarely. Such ungratefulness tends to come as a
surprise to US leaders. In 2003, Condoleezza Rice was dismayed to
discover resistance to US initiatives in Iraq: "There were times," she
said later, "that it appeared that American power was seen to be more
dangerous than, perhaps, Saddam Hussein." 108 [Both liberals and
neoconservatives]{.underline} probably [**exaggerate** the extent to
which US hegemony is everywhere secretly welcomed]{.underline}; [it is
not just petulant resentment, but understandable disagreement with US
policies,]{.underline} that **[motivates counterhegemonic beliefs and
behavior]{.underline}**. To review, assuming for a moment that US
leaders are subject to the same forces that affect every human being,
they overestimate the amount of control they have over other actors, and
are not as important to decisions made elsewhere as they believe
themselves to be[. And they probably perceive their own benevolence to
be much greater than do others]{.underline}. These common phenomena all
influence US beliefs in the same direction, and may well increase the
apparent explanatory power of hegemony beyond what the facts would
otherwise support. [The United States is probably **not as centra**l to
the New Peace as either liberals or neoconservatives
believe.]{.underline} In the end[, what can be said about the
relationship between US power and international stability? Probably not
much that will satisfy partisans,]{.underline} and the pacifying virtue
of US hegemony will remain largely an article of faith in some circles
in the policy world. Like most beliefs, it will remain immune to
alteration by logic and evidence. [Beliefs rarely change]{.underline},
so debates rarely end. For those not yet fully converted, however,
perhaps it will be significant that corroborating evidence for the
relationship is extremely hard to identify. [If indeed hegemonic
stability exists, it does so without leaving much of a trace. Neither
Washington's spending, nor its interventions, nor its overall grand
strategy seem to matter much to the levels of armed conflict around the
world]{.underline} (apart from those wars that Uncle Sam starts). [The
empirical record does not contain strong reasons to believe that
unipolarity and the New Peace are related,]{.underline} and [insights
from political psychology suggest that hegemonic stability **is a
belief**]{.underline} particularly [susceptible to
**misperception**]{.underline}. [US leaders probably
**exaggerate**]{.underline} [the degree to which their power
matters]{.underline}, and could retrench without much risk to themselves
or the world around them[. Researchers will need to look elsewhere to
explain why the world has entered into the most peaceful period in its
history]{.underline}. The good news from this is that the [New Peace
will probably persist for quite some time]{.underline}, **[no matter how
dominant the United States is]{.underline}**, [or what
policies]{.underline} President [**Trump** follows, or how much
resentment its actions cause in the periphery]{.underline}. [The people
of the twenty-first century are likely to be much safer and more secure
than any of their predecessors]{.underline}, even if many of them do not
always believe it.

###  Exts. Fettweis 

#### No impact to heg---America's role is misperceived in creating peace

Political Science at Tulane University, "Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the
New Peace", *Security Studies, 26:3, 423-451*, Taylor and Francis

[Evidence]{.underline} [supporting]{.underline} the notion that [US
power is primarily responsible for the New Peace **is slim**, but
belief]{.underline} in the connection [is quite strong]{.underline},
especially in policy circles. The best arena to examine the proposition
is therefore not the world of measurable rationality, but rather that of
the human mind. [Political psychology can shed more light on
unipolarity]{.underline} [than can any collection of data or
evidence.]{.underline} Just because an outcome is primarily
psychological does not mean that it is less real; perception quickly
becomes reality for both the unipolar state and those in the periphery[.
If all actors believe that the United States provides security and
stability for the system, **then behavior can be
affected**]{.underline}. [Beliefs have deep explanatory power in
international politics]{.underline} whether they have a firm foundation
in empirical reality or not. [Like all beliefs, faith in the stability
provided by hegemony is **rarely subjected** to much
analysis]{.underline}.79 Although they almost always have some basis in
reality, beliefs need not pass rigorous tests to prove that they match
it. No amount of evidence has been able to convince some people that
vaccines do not cause autism, for example, or that the world is more
peaceful than at any time before, or that the climate is changing due to
human activity. Ultimately, as Robert [Jervis explains, "we often
believe as much in the face of evidence as because of it]{.underline}."
80 [Facts may change, **but beliefs remain the same.**]{.underline} When
leaders are motivated to act based on unjustified, inaccurate beliefs,
folly often follows. The person who decides to take a big risk because
of astrological advice in the morning's horoscope can benefit from
baseless superstition if the risk pays off. Probability and luck suggest
that successful policy choices can sometimes flow from incorrect
beliefs. Far more often, however, poor intellectual foundations lead to
suboptimal or even disastrous outcomes. It is worthwhile to analyze the
foundations of even our most deeply held beliefs to determine which ones
are good candidates to inspire poor policy choices in those who hold
them[. People are wonderful rationalizers]{.underline}. [There is much
to be said for being the strongest country in the world; their status
provides Americans both security and psychological rewards]{.underline},
as well as strong incentives to construct a rationale for preserving the
unipolar moment that goes beyond mere selfishness. Since people enjoy
being "number one," they are susceptible to perceiving reality in ways
that brings the data in line with their desires. It is no coincidence
that most hegemonic stability theorists are American.81 [Perhaps the
satisfaction that comes with being the unipolar power has inspired
Americans to **misperceive** the positive role that their status plays
in the world]{.underline}. Three findings from political psychology can
shed light on perceptions of hegemonic stability. They are mutually
supportive, and, when taken together, suggest that it is likely that US
policymakers overestimate the extent to which their actions are
responsible for the choices of others. [The belief in the major US
contribution to world peace is probably **unjustified.**]{.underline}

#### Their authors have an ego-centric bias about heg---psychological studies prove 

**Fettweis 17**---Christopher J. Fettweis, Associate Professor of
Political Science at Tulane University, "Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the
New Peace", *Security Studies, 26:3, 423-451*, Taylor and Francis

[It is natural for people]{.underline}, whether presidents or commoners,
[to misperceive the role they play]{.underline} in the thinking process
of others. [Jervis was the first to discuss this
phenomenon]{.underline}, now [known]{.underline} [as the **"ego-centric
bias,**"]{.underline} which has been put to the test many times since he
wrote four decades ago. Building on what was known as "attribution
theory," Jervis observed that actors tend to overestimate their
importance in the decisions of others. Rarely are our actions as
consequential upon their behavior as we believe them to be.92 This is
not merely ego gratification, though that plays a role; actors are
simply more conscious of their own actions than the other factors
central to the internal deliberations in other capitals. [Because people
are more likely to remember their contributions to an
outcome,]{.underline} they naturally grant themselves more causal
weight.93 [Two]{.underline} further [aspects of the ego-centric bias
make US analysts even more susceptible]{.underline} to its effects[.
First, the bias is magnified when the behavior of others is
desirable.]{.underline} People generally take credit for positive
outcomes and deflect responsibility for negative ones. [This
"self-serving bias" is one of the best-established findings in modern
psychology,]{.underline} supported by many hundreds of studies.94
[Supporters of]{.underline} Ronald [Reagan are happy to give him credit
for ending the Cold War]{.underline}, for instance[, even though
evidence that the United States had much influence on]{.underline}
Premier [Gorbachev's decision making is scant at best.]{.underline}95
Today, since few outcomes are more desirable than global stability, it
stands to reason that [perceptions of the New Peace are prime candidates
for distortion by ego-centric, self-serving biases. When war breaks out,
it is not the fault of US leaders]{.underline}; [when peace comes to a
region, Washington is happy to take credit]{.underline}. There was for
some time a debate among psychologists over just how universal
self-serving biases were, or whether their effects varied across
cultures. [Extensive research has essentially settled the matter, to the
extent that academic questions can ever be settled]{.underline}: [a
direct relationship appears to exist between]{.underline} cultural
[individualism and]{.underline} susceptibility to the
[bias]{.underline}, perhaps because of the value individualistic
societies place on self-enhancement (as opposed to self-effacement).96
Actors from more collectivist societies tend to have their egos rewarded
in different ways, such as through contributions to the community and
connections to others. [People from Western]{.underline} [countries are
**far more likely** to take credit for positive outcomes]{.underline}
than those from Easter[n, in other words]{.underline}, and [subjects in
the United States tower over the rest of the West. US leaders are
therefore more culturally **predisposed** to believe that their actions
are responsible for positive outcomes like peace]{.underline}. Second,
[self-perception is directly related to egocentric attributions.
Individuals with high self-esteem are more likely to believe that they
are at the center of the decision-making process]{.underline} of others
than those who think somewhat more modestly.97 [Leaders of any unipolar
state may well be more likely to hold their country in **high
regard**,]{.underline} [and therefore are more vulnerable to
**exaggerated egocentric perception**s]{.underline}, than their
contemporaries in smaller states. It might not occur to the lead
diplomat of other counties to claim, as did Madeleine Albright, that "if
we have to use force, it is because we are America; we are the
indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other
countries into the future." 98 It is not unreasonable to suspect that
the US security community may be even more vulnerable to this
misperception than the average group of people. For example, many in
that community believed that the United States played a decisive role in
Vladimir Putin's decisions regarding Crimea and eastern Ukraine.
President Obama's various critics argued that perceptions of American
weakness inspired or even invited Russian aggression. The refusal to act
in Syria in particular emboldened Moscow (despite the fact that in 2008,
in the face of ample displays of US action in the Middle East, Moscow
had proven sufficiently bold to invade Georgia). Other critics suggested
that a variety of provocative US behaviors since the end of the Cold
War, especially the expansion of NATO and dissolution of the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, poisoned US--Russian relations and led to
an increase in Kremlin paranoia and eventually to the invasion.99 So,
either through provocative weakness or bullying, we were responsible for
their actions. Egocentric misperceptions are so ubiquitous and pervasive
that they generate something of a law of political psychology: we are
probably less influential in others' decision making than we think we
are. This extends to their decisions to resolve contentious issues
peacefully. [While it may be natural for US policymakers to interpret
their role as crucial in the maintenance of world peace,]{.underline} it
[is very likely that Washington **exaggerat**es its importance in the
decision making]{.underline} of others, and [in the maintenance of
international stability. The effect of the ego-centric bias may be
especially difficult for the unipolar United States to
resis]{.underline}t, because other countries do regularly take
Washington's position into account before acting. [But US
leaders]{.underline}---and the people who analyze them[---should keep in
mind that they are still probably less important to calculations made in
other capitals than they believe. They may well be especially unlikely
to recognize the possibility that hegemony is
epiphenomenal]{.underline}, that it exists alongside[, but does not
affect, global stability and the New Peace.]{.underline}

### Unipolarity Fails 

#### Unipolarity fails---collapse international institutions 

**Flockhart 16**---Trine Flockhart, Senior Researcher at the Danish
Institute for International Studies (DIIS), former associate professor
at universities in Australia, Denmark and Britain, "The coming
multi-order world", *Contemporary Security Policy, 2016 Vol. 37, No. 1,
3--30*, Taylor and Francis Online, 2016//Lee

[The system that emerged following the collapse of the Soviet-led order
was unipolar]{.underline} at the systemic level because it contained
only one hegemonic power. [Such a system is widely assumed to be
short-lived as it is anticipated that an alternative great power
sooner]{.underline} or later will appear on the horizon to challenge the
hegemon. [I do not agree that unipolarity is inherently
shortlived,]{.underline} provided that it is supported with a stable
universalized international society. [However]{.underline}, this is
precisely the point -- [maintaining a global universalized liberal
international society appears to be]{.underline}, as Charles Kupchan
expresses it -- wishful thinking!74 The unipolar system seemed
nevertheless for a while to be supported by a universal liberal
international society. Francis [Fukuyama boldly proclaimed 'the end of
history' and the triumph of liberalism as the 'final form of human
government']{.underline}. 75 The [claim seemed at first vindicated by a
wave of democratization]{.underline} processes and [in an unprecedented
level of global cooperation such as in the liberation of Kuwait.
However]{.underline}, beneath the surface all was not well in the four
constitutive parts of the liberal international society and with [the
arrival of]{.underline} George W. [Bush]{.underline} in the Oval
Office[, things took a turn for the worse]{.underline}. The
[Bush]{.underline} Administration [took unipolarity and American
hegemony as an opportunity to ride rough shot over longstanding primary
institutions]{.underline} such as multilateralism and the [established
practice of negotiation and]{.underline} it '[disrespected' the
cherished secondary institutions]{.underline} that were seen by many of
the key members of the liberal order as the cornerstones of the order.76
The perceived intransigence of the [Bush]{.underline} Administration
[sent shockwaves]{.underline} [around the liberal order and had
detrimental effects on the multilateral institutions]{.underline} [that
for so long had been regarded as its cornerstone]{.underline}.77 [It
soon became clear that the problems were not limited to the internal
cohesion of the liberal order,]{.underline} [but that some states and
non-state actors **rejected it altogether.**]{.underline} This was of
course most forcefully and tragically displayed in the attacks on New
York and Washington in September 2001[. It has since become evident that
the appeal of the liberal international order and the legitimacy of its
secondary institutions is not universal and that a growing number of
states -- even some democratic states -- are hesitant about membership
of liberal order.]{.underline} The acceptance of Western power and
institutions by non-Western states or colonies was apparently only skin
deep as a necessary price to have paid for decolonization.78 [With
alternative international orders emerging, the cost--benefit
calculations of states that do not really share the fundamental
principles rooted in a Western identity therefore looks set to
change]{.underline}. This seems to be precisely the kind of calculations
that some states -- such as Turkey, Brazil, India, Russia and others
have engaged in recently.

## China

### 2AC---China---Not Revisionist 

#### China isn't revisionist, they're [neo-revisionist]{.underline} --- economic interdependence, promotion of the LIO, Confucianism prove they want to be [friends]{.underline}

**Wilson 19** -- Professor of Russian and Chinese Studies at Wheaton
College (Jeanne L., \"Are Russia and China revisionist states?\", Asia
Dialogue, 6-11-2019,
https://theasiadialogue.com/2019/06/11/are-russia-and-china-revisionist-states/))SK

At the same time, [Russia and China]{.underline} accept and in fact
[continuously reaffirm their commitment to]{.underline} a number of
fundamental precepts of [the **international order**]{.underline}.
[These include]{.underline} the primacy of state sovereignty and
[territorial integrity]{.underline}, the importance of [international
law]{.underline}, [and the]{.underline} centrality of the
[U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations, particularly with respect to
the key role of the United Nations Security Council. It must be
acknowledged that Russian and Chinese promotion of these concepts does
not necessarily provide a reliable guide to their foreign policy
behaviour (although the same criticism can be lodged against countless
other states). [Russia and China]{.underline} also actively participate
in aspects of global governance, [plac]{.underline}ing an [emphasis on
the United Nations as the ultimate source of international
authority]{.underline}. [Both]{.underline} states have [signed a number
of U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations [Conventions and
Covenants]{.underline} including the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights. [They are members of a number of multilateral and
regional structures]{.underline} (although Russia has been suspended
from participation in the G-7). [The two]{.underline} states
[stress]{.underline} their [commitment to]{.underline} the maintenance
of global and regional security supporting the
**[non-proliferation]{.underline}** of nuclear weapons, the
**[non-militarization of space]{.underline}**, [and the need to fight
terrorism]{.underline}. Critically, [Russia and China act as **rule
takers rather than challengers** in their participation in the **global
financial institutions**]{.underline}. [China]{.underline}, in
particular, [has emerged as a vocal supporter of globalization and free
trade in]{.underline} conspicuous [contrast to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates in the Trump administration. [Russia and
China]{.underline}'s view of the operation of the international system
[conform]{.underline}s in a large part [to Westphalian
precepts]{.underline}, while rejecting the West's more recent adoption
of humanitarian and individualistic norms and values (which in fact
exist in a state of uneasy tension with the traditional assumptions of
the Westphalian order). In this sense, [Russia and China are
**neo-revisionist** rather than revisionist states]{.underline}. Under
the Xi Jinping leadership, China has adopted a more
[assertive]{.underline} foreign policy that, in contrast to the
behaviour of past leadership, confidently asserts China's status as a
great power. On the one hand, this is reflected in the State's efforts
to readjust China's role in international structures, as seen in the
attempt to expand its decision-making power within the International
Monetary Fund. This sort of [behaviour]{.underline}, however, [takes
place within the boundaries of the contemporary international
community]{.underline}. On the other hand, [China's launching of the
Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline} (BRI) in 2013 can be viewed as
offering an alternative vision of global governance that challenges the
approach promoted by the hegemonic Western powers. Beijing has [offered
a number of rationales]{.underline} for BRI [which are]{.underline} in
themselves at least in part [persuasive]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
massive infrastructure [project can be seen as a means of developing
China's Western regions, utilizing surplus capital and providing
employment, extending Chinese export markets, and securing domestic
energy supplies]{.underline}. Generally speaking, [the
Chinese]{.underline} leadership has [sought to downplay]{.underline} the
strategic and [geopolitical implications]{.underline} of BRI. In fact,
[the BRI is closely]{.underline} [associated with]{.underline} two
rather amorphous concepts: the "Community of Common Destiny" (minyun
gongtongti) and the "Silk Road Spirit" (silu Jingshen). The Community of
Common Destiny relies on a sort of updating of
**[Confucianism]{.underline}** ([that is]{.underline} also reminiscent
of [the Five Principles of **Peaceful Coexistence)** to stress **mutual
benefit, friendship, equality, and win-win outcomes**]{.underline}. [The
Silk Road Spirit provides a parallel emphasis on **inclusivity** that
emphasizes the right of all states to choose their own social
systems]{.underline}, a pointed rejection of the democracy and human
rights agenda of the hegemonic West. Although the initial focus of BRI
and the Community of Common Destiny is regional, the long-term
implications are global. The BRI and the Community of Common Destiny
potentially posit a Sinocentric global community that locates China at
its epicentre.

###  Exts. China---Not Revisionist 

#### Imposing western views of nation states on China results in *[false threat perception]{.underline}* -- rather, viewing China as a *[civilization state]{.underline}* helps us understand that China is not revisionist 

Martin **Jaques**, 1-15-20**11**, \"Civilization state versus
nation-state,\" Süddeutsche Zeitung,

(Martin Jacques (born 1945) is a British journalist, editor, academic,
political commentator and author. King's college, PhD TUC Policy // NC)

[China confronts Europe with an enormous problem: **we do not understand
it.**]{.underline} Worse, we are not even conscious of the fact. [We
insist on seeing the world through our Western prism.]{.underline} No
other tradition or history or culture can compare. Ours is superior to
all and others, in deviating from ours, are diminished as a consequence.
[This speaks not of our wisdom but our ignorance]{.underline}, an
expression not of our cosmopolitanism but our insularity and
provincialism. It is a consequence of being in the ascendant for at
least two centuries, if not rather longer. Eurocentrism -- or perhaps we
should say [western-centrism -- has become our universal yardstick
against which, in varying degrees, all others fail.]{.underline} This
mindset threatens to become our greatest handicap as we enter an era in
which Europe will be progressively marginalized, **[the United States
will experience irreversible decline, the emergent nations will become
major actors and China will replace the United States as the dominant
power]{.underline}**. In other words, those countries and cultures that
we now look down upon will increasingly become the arbiters of the
future. How will we ever make sense of them if we refuse to understand
them in anything other than our own Western terms? How will they view us
if we continue to look down upon their culture and polities as inferior
to our own? [Which brings us to China. We choose to see China
overwhelmingly in a context calibrated according to Western values: what
overwhelmingly preoccupies us is the absence of a Western-style
democracy, a lack of human rights, the plight of the Tibetans, and the
country's poor environmental record]{.underline}. No doubt you could add
a few more to that list[. I am not arguing that such issues do not
matter]{.underline} -- they do -- **[but our insistence on judging China
in our own terms diverts us from a far more important task:
understanding China in its own terms.]{.underline}** If we fail to do
that then, quite simply, we will never understand it. [That is
why]{.underline} mainstream [Western commentary on China]{.underline}
over the last three or more decades [has singularly failed to get China
right]{.underline}, from predicting the imminent downfall of the regime
after Tiananmen Square and the likely break-up of the country, to the
constant insistence ever since that the economic growth could not
possibly last and that the regime would be unable to sustain itself.
Virtually no-one predicted what has happened; phenomenal economic growth
for over thirty years and a regime that has been hugely successful and
which now enjoys greater legitimacy and prestige than at any time since
the reform period began in 1978. Our western-centric value-judgements
about China must no longer be allowed to act as a substitute for
understanding the country in its own terms. [This is no easy task. China
is profoundly different from the West in the most basic of ways. Perhaps
the most basic difference is that it is not a nation-state in the
European sense]{.underline} of the term. Indeed, it has only described
itself as such since around 1900. Anyone who knows anything about China
is aware that it is a lot older than that. China, as we know it today,
dates back to 221BC, in some respects much earlier. That date marked the
end of the Warring States period, the victory of the Qin, and the birth
of the Qin Empire whose borders embraced a considerable slice of what is
today the eastern half of China and by far its most populous part. [For
over two millennia, **the Chinese thought of themselves as a
civilization rather than a nation. The most fundamental defining
features of China today**]{.underline}, and which give the Chinese their
sense of identity, [emanate not from the last centur]{.underline}y when
China has called itself a nation-state [but from the previous two
millennia when it can be best described as a
civilization-state]{.underline}: the relationship between the state and
society, a very distinctive notion of the family, ancestral worship,
Confucian values, the network of personal relationships that we call
guanxi, Chinese food and the traditions that surround it, and, of
course, the Chinese language with its unusual relationship between the
written and spoken form. [The implications are profound: whereas
national identity]{.underline} in Europe [is overwhelming]{.underline}ly
a product of the era of the nation-state -- [in the United
State]{.underline}s almost exclusively so -- [in China, on the contrary,
the sense of identity has]{.underline} primarily [been
shaped]{.underline} by [the country's history as a
civilization-state]{.underline}. Although China describes itself today
as a nation-state, [it remains essentially a civilization-state in terms
of history, culture, identity and ways of thinking]{.underline}. China's
geological structure is that of a civilization-state; the nation-state
accounts for little more than the top soil. China, as a
civilization-state, has two main characteristics. Firstly, there is its
exceptional longevity, dating back to even before the break-up of the
Roman Empire. Secondly, the sheer scale of China -- both geographic and
demographic -- means that it embraces a huge diversity. Contrary to the
Western belief that China is highly centralised, in fact in many
respects the opposite is the case: indeed, it would have been impossible
to govern the country -- either now or in the dynastic period -- on such
a basis. It is simply too large[. The implications in terms of the way
the Chinese think are profound. In 1997 Hong Kong was handed over to
China by the British. The Chinese constitutional proposal was summed up
in the phrase: 'one country, two systems']{.underline}. [Barely anyone
in the West gave this maxim much]{.underline} thought or indeed
credence; [the assumption was that Hong Kong would soon become like the
rest of China. This was entirely wrong. The political and legal
structure of Hong Kong remains as different now from the rest of China
as in 1997]{.underline}. The reason we did not take the Chinese
seriously is that the West is characterised by a nation-state mentality,
hence when Germany was unified in 1990 it was done solely and
exclusively on the basis of the Federal Republic; the DDR in effect
disappeared. 'One nation-state, one system' is the nation-state way of
thinking. But, as a civilization-state, the Chinese logic is quite
different. [Because China is so vast and embraces such diversity, as a
matter of necessity it must be flexible: 'one civilization, many
systems'. **The idea of China as a civilization-state is a fundamental
building block for understanding China in its own terms**]{.underline}.
And it has multifarious implications. The relationship between the state
and society in China is very different to that in the West. Contrary to
the overwhelming Western assumption that the Chinese state lacks
legitimacy and is bereft of public support, in fact the Chinese state
enjoys greater legitimacy than any Western state. We have come to assume
that the legitimacy of the state overwhelmingly rests on the democratic
process -- universal suffrage, competing parties et al. But this is only
one element: if it was the whole story, then the Italian state would
enjoy a robust legitimacy rather than the reality, a chronic lack of it.
And to explain this we have to go back to the Risorgimento as only a
partially fulfilled project. The reason why the Chinese state enjoys a
formidable legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese has nothing to do with
democracy but can be found in the relationship between the state and
Chinese civilization. The state is seen as the embodiment, guardian and
defender of Chinese civilization. Maintaining the unity, cohesion and
integrity of Chinese civilization -- of the civilization-state -- is
perceived as the highest political priority and is seen as the
sacrosanct task of the Chinese state. Unlike in the West, where the
state is viewed with varying degrees of suspicion, even hostility, and
is regarded, as a consequence, as an outsider, in China the state is
seen as an intimate, as part of the family, indeed as the head of the
family; interestingly, in this context, the Chinese term for
nation-state is 'nation-family'. Or consider a quite different example.
Over 90 per cent of Chinese think of themselves as of one race, the Han.
This is so different from the world's other most populous nations --
India, United States, Indonesia and Brazil, all of which are highly
multi-racial -- as to be extraordinary. Of course, in reality the Han
were a product of many different races, but the Han do not think of
themselves like that. And the reason takes us back to the
civilization-state and one of its defining characteristics, namely
China's remarkable longevity. Over thousands of years, as a result of
many processes, cultural, racial and ethnic, the differences between the
many races that comprised the Han have been weakened to the point where
they were no longer significant. [**We will never make sense of China if
we persist in treating it as if it is, or should be, a product of our
own civilization**. Our present attitude towards China is a function of
arrogance and ignorance]{.underline}. And it threatens to leave us
bewildered, confused and alienated. Our historical inheritance, and the
mentality it has engendered, ill equips us for the very new world that
is presently unfolding before us.

## Russia 

### 2AC---Russia---Not Revisionist 

#### Western literature misconstrues Russia as revisionist, rather it adopts a *[defensive realist]{.underline}* stance against American expansionism 

Andrey **Sushentsov, 6-12-**2019, "Russia -- a Global Revisionist?,"

Instead, let's answer the following question: [is Russia essentially a
revisionist in the global system]{.underline}? If the latter is
understood as the Western centric system of liberal democracies, the
answer is yes. Russia has never -- not even in the early 1990s -- fully
considered this system global, legitimate and efficient. Moscow
considered a different system to be truly global -- a global system of
multilateral regulation by sovereign states with reliance on the UN and
international law. It is within this system that the security interests
of all states, regardless of their domestic system, were recognized and
respected, the principle of non-interference in a country's domestic
affairs was universal, while decision making on global issues was
collective and a prerogative of the UN Security Council. In other words,
in a multilateral, or to use the Russian term, polycentric world system
it was necessary to consider Russia's security interests during NATO's
expansion while unilateral actions like aggressive wars and invasions to
support coups should be eliminated from international life. Signs of
Russia's consistent intention to rely on the said principles came from
the first Russian governments. [At the CSCE conference in Stockholm in
1992, then Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev staged a real demarche by
delivering a stunning speech before Western foreign ministers and MPs to
the effect that NATO expansion was unacceptable because it would compel
**Russia to take reciprocal steps**.]{.underline} After some time
Kozyrev returned to the podium and admitted that this was a deliberate
provocation to show how his successor would speak if he failed to build
a constructive system of relations with the West. Two years later Boris
Yeltsin made his famous speech in Budapest about Cold Peace. He sounded
similar to Kozyrev but his speech was a true political statement rather
than a provocation. Demonising Russia and the Geopolitical Consequences
David Lane [**As a consequence of Western misperception of Russia's
interests and potential power,** Russia will develop its self-conception
as an alternative civilisation to the West. Geo-politically, Russia's
growing alliance with China is an outcome of the **West's misguided
hostility to Russia -- expressed in the expansion of
NATO**,]{.underline} the abrogation of nuclear arms agreements, support
for extra-legal political regime change and a series of destabilising
economic sanctions. EXPERT OPINIONS The speeches made by Yeltsin in
Budapest in 1994 and Putin in Munich in 2007 contain the same theme.
Does this mean that Yeltsin's Russia was more revisionist than Putin's?
Probably not. It is possible to generalize that Russia's vision of
itself in international relations is rooted in its strategic experience
and does not depend on international political cycles or the business
environment. Russia's historical problem is that it is not an island.
For three centuries, Russia had to maintain the world's largest national
territory while remaining protected and militarily advanced. Its almost
endless borders, its open East European flatlands and its numerous
rivals turned Russia into one of the most active players in wars and
diplomacy. This rich, diverse and often painful experience has turned
the Russian elite into natural realists that find it difficult to
believe in the power of ideas and who rely more on pragmatic forecasts.
The foundations of Russian doctrine are rooted in the conviction that
states are the leading players in international relations and compete
against each other under conditions of anarchy; that their key resource
is sovereignty and that conflicts between them are normal. Human nature
is imperfect and the character of a state regime is unimportant for
constructive international relations. What, in Russia's opinion, is the
guarantee of stability in international relations? It should rest on
common rules of conduct fixed in international law that is supported by
a balance of forces between the participants in the system. If Russia's
vision of international relations is expressed as a metaphor, it would
be the image of Atlases who carry the heavens on their shoulders with
each Atlas representing a separate great power. Their common task is to
keep the heavens intact but when they try to compete, the heavens
collapse. In this system the United States is a leading Atlas who
carries the heaviest part of the heavens. However, this metaphor is
static -- any changes in this system must be endorsed by all key
Atlases. And, of course, this metaphor rules out a linear development
logic: the views of the Atlases do not matter if they support the
heavens [So, is Russia a revisionist? Faced with a choice between
unilateral and collective actions it most often calls for cooperation
and talks. **It chooses a pragmatic attitude over ideology-driven
policy. It favors global stability over military supremacy.** In other
words, its **behavior is contrary to the conduct of those who accuse it
of revisionism. Russia is not a global revisionist.** It is possible to
say that its strategic experience makes it a calm observer of
experiments launched by more active and truly revisionist
states.]{.underline} Russia is convinced that revisionists lack
strategic experience and are concurrently accumulating it in the course
of multiple and politically unsuccessful military operations over the
past few decades. Naturally, Russia will not remain idle if its security
interests are impinged upon. It will react to aggressive moves by other
states, which threaten these interests. Although Moscow will be accused
of revisionism in these episodes, the opposite seems more logical.
Protecting its interests, Russia is upholding the world order based on
sovereignty and a mutual consideration of interests. Russia-EU: Do We
Have a Chance to Unfreeze Dialogue? EU-Russian relations are aggravated
by the fact that Europe is facing new challenges, which it cannot
respond to, and is becoming increasingly obsessed with its own problems.
Nevertheless, it remains a crucial neighbour and partner for Russia. By
cooperating with Russia and correlating European and European
integrations, the EU could enhance its role in the world of tomorrow.

###  Exts. Russia---Not Revisionist

#### Russia wants integration into the international system but conceptions of Russia as the enemy re-enforces its alliances with China and increases its chances of becoming revisionist

The lifting of the Iron Curtain separating the Soviet bloc from the rest
of the world led to high expectations from the established powers in the
West and the reformers in the East. The public believed that the Cold
War and the threat of war had ended. On both sides, statesmen and
citizens believed that the dismantling of the planned economies, the
elimination of the dominant communist parties and the disavowal of the
hegemonic ideology of Marxism-Leninism would provide the conditions for
peace. [But the end of the Cold War has led to a cold peace. It appears
that another iron curtain has been lowered again: this time on an
isolated Russia confronted by the hegemonic forces of the West led by
the USA.]{.underline} In Richard Sakwa's excellent analysis\*, at the
root of the division of the post Soviet era is a fundamental incongruity
between the vision of what kind of world order would follow in the wake
of the end the communist European powers. [The vision of Mikhail
Gorbachev and the Russian reform movement was that the post-communist
states would form part of a new Greater Europe.]{.underline} The
divisions in which Russia had previously figured would no longer exist.
The institutions of Cold War -- NATO and the Warsaw Pact- would dissolve
as they would be redundant. They could be disbanded in favour of
strengthening the pan-European Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (CSCE). Economically, the CMEA (Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance) countries could have continued in a trading block,
conducting free trade with third parties. This could have taken the
shape of either a customs' union, or bilateral trading links with the
(then) European Community. Either of these courses, though to different
degrees, would have retained the existing pattern of trade and
production whilst leading to a gradual re-orientation to world markets.
The former 'historical Europe' (the core members of the European Union)
would be transformed into a 'Greater Europe' encompassing the countries
from Lisbon to Vladivostok. An invigorated United Nations might become
an arbiter of international politics. This was a vision of a new world
order based on pluralism, multi-polarity and democracy between states
which would ensure peace. Different socio-political orders would have
the political space to coexist. Europe 'Whole and Free' [The dominant
geo-political forces in the West had other ideas. George H.W. Bush led
the neo-conservative interests whose world-view was based on the
formation of a 'new world order']{.underline}. The Western powers had
triumphed. They had 'won' the Cold War. Consequently, the post-Soviet
states should be invited to join the Western powers. There was to be a
Europe 'whole and free'. 'Europe' however was defined as the states at
the core of the nascent European Union, which could (and would) include
member states from the former Soviet Union but only if they accepted the
Union's neo-liberal conditions for political and economic membership.
These included not only free markets in labour, goods, services, the
privatisation of large tracts of state owned property, the opening up of
the economy to foreign competition and the right of 'establishment' of
foreign corporations, but also politically a shift to electoral
democracy and the strengthening of civil society. The post-communist New
Member States of the European Union partially relinquished their
sovereignty in joining the Union[. To confirm their political identity,
they opted for membership of NATO, thus merging their societies with the
values, institutions and geo-politics of the West. **Except for the
Baltic states, the former Republics of the USSR were excluded.**
Underlying these developments was a failure by the West to
create]{.underline}, as Sakwa puts it[, an 'inclusive peace order' to
integrate the post-Soviet states into a world political
community.]{.underline} The Atlantic Alliance not only remained but
became more assertive following the triumph of winning the battle with
communism. [Rather than transforming international relations in a new
geo-political context, the **West insisted on the superiority of
'Western values' and institutions.**]{.underline} It was made clear by
the leaders of the United States that the new rules of the international
order would be the rules laid down by the American world order. These
included not only capitalist economies and competitive electoral
democracy but also civic individual freedoms, diversity and identity
politics. [While many other countries have different values to the
Atlantic countries (China being the primary example), they have not led
to confrontation and to the demonising of their leaders]{.underline}.
Russia's concern to be recognised as having a sphere of interest in its
near abroad was resisted, even dismissed. Its leaders were dubbed as
pursuing anachronistic great power politics and Russia was denied a
major power status. Russia's Post-Soviet Weaknesses [The process of
transformation led to humiliation for Russia. Unlike the Soviet Union
which had an ideological identity backed by economic weight and military
power, the post-Soviet Russian Federation was economically weakened,
ideologically exhausted and politically divided. Russia lacked political
power and a civilisational identity]{.underline}. Between 1990 and 2009,
Russia's ranking in the United Nation\'s world development indicators
(which not only include economic but also health and education
measures), for example, fell from 31st to 70th. These weaknesses,
however, are insufficient to explain the rise of a new 'cold peace'[. A
major factor is that Russia, under President Putin, did not accept a
subaltern role in the world political system. **Disrespect has turned to
demonization.** While the Warsaw Pact was dissolved, the American
military and security elites were sufficiently powerful to keep in place
the institutions of the Cold War, notably NATO.]{.underline} Also to
reduce the geo-political space of Russia, the newly formed European
post-communist states were drawn into membership of, or binding linkages
to, the European Union. Economic and strategic interests were involved
in seeking the subordination of Russia to American hegemony. It is here
perhaps that one should acknowledge the role of what C. Wright Mills in
the 1950s dubbed as the military-industrial complex. Economic interests
played an important role in claiming an area for investment and exports
in the former Communist countries; they were predisposed to believe that
threats existed from a 'resurgent' Russia as this legitimated further
military expenditure on research and military hardware. **[There is a
contradictory logic at work here]{.underline}**: [Russia was considered
too weak to be a world power but concurrently strong enough to be
regarded as a military threat to world peace.]{.underline} Richard Sakwa
has plausibly argued that [**Russia is not a revisionist state** - the
post-Soviet leadership is not opposed to the international structures
and procedures laid down by the West. But it does seek a respected place
in the international political order]{.underline}. Russia is committed
to the promotion of 'universal human values': Article 15.4 of the 1993
Constitution of the Russian Federation recognises the 'principles and
norms of international law' and thus tempers Russian sovereignty. [The
Russian leadership under Putin has sought an accommodation with the
West.]{.underline} In his address to the Valdai Club in 2013, he
emphasised the commitment of Russia to Western Christian values. The
implication is that ideological differences between the West and Russia
could be bridged. However, conflict is never solely ideological.
Economic and geo-political issues and interests are at stake. And these
too could be reconciled as Russia has no need for geographical expansion
and there is a reciprocity of interests with the European Union through
trade. [However the conditions offered have not been acceptable.
Russia's response has led to the founding of the Eurasian Union and to
the forging of stronger economic and political links with China,
particularly through institutions such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation]{.underline}. Towards a Restless Peace [**As a consequence
of Western misperception of Russia's interests and potential power,
Russia will develop its self-conception as an alternative civilisation
to the West.** Geo-politically, Russia's growing alliance with China is
an outcome of the West's misguided hostility to Russia -- expressed in
the expansion of NATO,]{.underline} the abrogation of nuclear arms
agreements, support for extra-legal political regime change and a series
of destabilising economic sanctions. The future of a possible economic,
cultural and military alliance with China and countries to the East
defines a new geo-political strategic order. Chinese leadership is
unlikely to be aggressive. **[And the relatively equal military balance
between a Russia-China alliance and NATO will ensure a restless
peace.]{.underline}**
