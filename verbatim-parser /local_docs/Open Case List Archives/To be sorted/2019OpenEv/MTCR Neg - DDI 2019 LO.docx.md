## Notes

#### The impacts besides SCS escalation are not super strategic:

#### The MTCR has pretty large loopholes in hypersonic missile regulation India, the UK, and the US (MTCR members) all have hypersonic missiles and virtually every big nuclear power already has hypersonic missiles, so their impact is non uq

#### You could probably cut an entire adv cp file on the space debris impact during your round because of how non-intrinsic to the aff it is

#### For the Drones impact you should bury them in case turns on how drones are good and mitigate conflict

## Off case

### Fill in

#### MTCR is allowing China to meet export demands for UAVs and missiles -- they are selling to potentially bad actors with no checks on who they sell to -- US exports are key to check this

Security and Defense Studies \"Export Control Reform: Better Late than
Never,\" Heritage Foundation,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/export-control-reform-better-late-never>)
(CB)

Last Thursday, the **[[Trump]{.mark} administration released
a [Presidential
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/national-security-presidential-memorandum-regarding-u-s-conventional-arms-transfer-policy/) that
[sensibly reforms U.S. conventional arms transfer
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The memo brings U.S. policy into closer
alignment with the economic and security interests of the U.S. and its
allies, through changes that reflect the rapid pace of technological
innovation and the competitive global environment.

An updated policy was sorely needed. Many regulations and agreements
governing U.S. arms transfers date back to when the U.S. maintained a
comfortable lead in military innovation. Since that time, globalization
has rapidly expanded other nations' access to advanced technologies and
complicated efforts to contain their spread and use.

**[[U.S. export controls are intended to limit proliferation of advanced
technologies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[The idea is to exercise
restraint in the transfer and sale of conventional arms, thereby keeping
U.S. capabilities out of the hands of our foes and other repressive
governments that might use them against their own citizens.
Unfortunately, these controls inundate allies and adversaries alike with
the same cumbersome licensing requirements and bureaucratic hurdles.
These processes inhibit opportunities for trade and cooperation---to the
detriment of U.S. industry. ]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, **[foreign militaries have chipped away at the U.S.
technological edge, increasing the number of countries willing and able
to sell advanced technologies in a burgeoning world
market.]{.underline}** Governments dismayed by U.S. policy (or prices)
can turn to other exporting countries for comparable systems.

The new policy addresses these failings, placing particular emphasis on
the domestic and international regulation of unmanned aerial systems
(UAS), commonly referred to as drones.

**[The U.S. is one of 35 signatories to the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR)---a multinational agreement
promoting voluntary restrictions on the transfer of missiles and missile
technology.  Under the MTCR, unmanned systems (whether armed or unarmed)
"[capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kg to a range of at
least 300 km](http://mtcr.info/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/)" are
categorized among the most heavily regulated items, for which export
requests "[are subject to an unconditional strong presumption of
denial](http://mtcr.info/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/)."]{.underline}**

**[As could be expected, the MTCR has been principally effective in
limiting the sales of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by its
signatories. The result has been to keep valuable capabilities away from
countries with overlapping security interests.  Meanwhile, China has
jumped to meet the global market demand, exercising far less restraint
and discernment about to whom it will sell both armed and unarmed UAVs.
As China expands its share of the global UAV market, it also expands its
influence in the regulation and use of autonomous
systems.]{.underline}**

Arms transfers will always carry a level of risk. But the U.S. is no
longer the only player in the game. The administration's new policy
recognizes the limitations of previous regulations.

Now, **[[the U.S. must work to eliminate obsolete and bureaucratic
barriers to U.S. exports]{.mark}, including inefficient licensing
requirements and outdated technology controls. A system that is
streamlined and responsive to global economic and security environments
will better support U.S. industries, [and advances the best interests of
the U.S., its partners, and allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Chinese drone sales are key to their sphere of influence in the One Belt One Road initiative and in the Middle East 

**Paulsson**, 11-10-**2018** (Henrik, PhD at Swedish Defence University,
\"Explaining the Proliferation of China's Drones,\" Diplomat,
<https://thediplomat.com/2018/11/explaining-the-proliferation-of-chinas-drones/>)
(CB)

[**[Chinese armed drones have been operated or ordered by 17
countries]{.underline}**.]{.mark} While visually similar to the U.S. and
Israeli drones, China's are cheaper and less advanced -- all the while
quite operational. What is curious is to whom the Chinese are selling
to, and their relation to wider policies and strategic choices. **[The
buyers are widely dispersed; [China has an interest in building links
with these countries]{.mark} because of geographic position, economic
conditions, or political situation. Most already have Chinese
investments, loans, and other weaponry.]{.underline}**

**[Many of [the countries importing Chinese drones lie along the path of
China's]{.mark} Belt and Road Initiative ([BRI]{.mark}). Pakistan and
Myanmar have long-standing ties with China, and both are now flying
Chinese armed dron]{.underline}**es, with Pakistan even producing a
licensed version of the Wing Loong II model. Further inland, Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have all received armed drones from China.
**[[All five of these countries are critical for the BRI to
function]{.mark}, and have seen increasing Chinese investments and
connections over recent years -- including significant military
investments in addition to the drones.]{.underline}**

**[Chinese interests extend also into Africa. Egypt, Algeria, and the
Ethiopian involvement in Somalia all have roles to play in the continued
viability of maritime trade from China to Europe]{.underline}**.
**[Zambia has large Chinese investments in their mining regions, while
Nigeria has oil and importantly lies on the Gulf of
Guinea.]{.underline}** These African and the above mentioned Asian
states are positioned along vital trade routes, giving China a distinct
interest in building relationships and providing tools to help secure
trade. The combination of both trade and investments provides ample
excuse to provide drones in addition to other weaponry -- all with
increased ties to the Chinese military and defense industry.

**[In the Middle East China is more opportunistic in selling their armed
drones, supplying them to countries that cannot get drones from Israel
or the United States for economic or political reasons]{.underline}**.
**[While the Israeli constraint is obvious, Iraq and Jordan are both
hindered by the high cost of U.S. drones -- instead opting for Chinese
versions for their fight against the Islamic State]{.underline}**.
Politically, **[the Saudi- and Emirati-led campaign in Yemen is more
problematic, where they are accused of war crimes utilizing Chinese
drones. The lessening influence of the United States in the Persian Gulf
also provides inroads for China to replace Washington, with their drones
being a useful tool in this endeavor.]{.underline}**

No matter the location, **[[all of the operators get pulled toward
China]{.mark}. [The sale of drones causes an increasing dependence on
Chinese materiel -- such as spare parts and missiles -- to operate in
the first place.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[The drones also create a
necessity to maintain defense ties with China for training and
operations.]{.underline}** These are, after all, quite advanced and
complicated machines. In their armed drones, China has found a way to
increase their influence and expand their presence with any country that
that the United States and Israel will not -- or cannot -- sell to.

#### The Chinese sphere of influence undercuts US hegemony

**Gilley and O'Neil 14** (Bruce, associate professor of political
science at the Mark Hatfield School of Government at Portland State
University, Andrew, Professor of Political Science, Georgetown

The role of middle powers in constraining hegemons (baquanguo), as
emphasized by Qian and others, obviously refers to the United States.
But **[[China too aspires to being a great power with hegemonic
potential]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially in Asia. **[This points up
the fundamental challenge for China to pursue a middle power--like
diplomacy]{.underline}**: **[as a historical great power and a
contemporary rising one, it is just as likely as the United States to
scorn the concept]{.underline}**. Moreover, unlike rising India, which
has been able to retain its middle power identity and middle
power--style ''niche diplomacy'' of multipolarity and peace building
despite its positional rise because of domestically determined
cosmopolitanism and emphasis on compromise, China has neither of these
attributes.30 Its self-identity is built upon an exclusive form of
nationalism and its domestic politics are characterized by ﬁnality and
coercion. **[[While the United States shares with China a self-identity
built on unique national characteristics, the pursuit of those aims by
Washington is signiﬁcantly constrained by its democratic
character]{.mark}. China looked something like an aligned middle
power]{.underline}** (like today's Canada or Australia) **[from 1949
until it began to detach itself from the Soviet Union with the ﬁrst
Khrushchev-Mao meeting in Beijing in 1958.]{.underline}** **[This was
followed by a period from 1958 until 1972, when China played a role in
world politics that, but for its size, has been described as akin to
that of a middle power.]{.underline}**31 For instance, its high proﬁle
at the Afro-Asian Conference begun at Bandung in 1955 signiﬁed its
commitment to multilateralism, sovereign equality, and nonalignment.
China's return to great power status with the Sino-US reconciliation
meant that it lost its leadership role within the nonaligned movement.
But in a sense, China has never stopped thinking of itself as a
counterhegemonic great power with middle power sensibilities. **[From
1997 to 2001, [China promoted a ''new security concept'' in
Asia]{.mark}. The soft edge of this was a reiteration of ''the ASEAN
Way'' of consensus, mutual respect, Westphalian noninterference, and
multilateralism. But the hard edge was the attempt to dismantle the
United States--centered huband-spoke alliances of the San Francisco
System as the region's security architecture]{.underline}**.32 **[China
subsequently dropped this hard edge, having been told by ASEAN states
about the indispensability of the American presence]{.underline}**.33
**[Middle and small powers in Asia seek a continued US presence not just
to hedge against a rising China, but also to avoid Japanese rearmament
and to manage nongreat power rivalries within the
region]{.underline}**---between Malaysia and Indonesia, for instance, or
Cambodia and Thailand.34 Jakarta's notion of a ''dynamic equilibrium''
in Asian politics is one that gradually accommodates China's great power
role but only alongside a continued American one.35 **[The more closely
US-aligned South Korea, meanwhile, signed military cooperation
agreements with Indonesia in 2008 and with Australia in
201]{.underline}**1. In the latter case, the defense ministers said in a
joint statement that the two countries are ''like-minded middle powers''
and ''natural security partners.''36 **[Yet neither country has been
willing to pursue the maintenance of the US-centric regional security
architecture that Washington desir]{.underline}**es. This is consistent
with middle power nonalignment. **[[China's intention continues to be a
widening of its acknowledged sphere of inﬂuence and ''core interests''
in Asia at the expense of the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
is where middle powers come in, Ding believes. By bandwagoning with
middle powers, China would gain ''global strategic space. ''Speciﬁcally,
cooperation with middle powers on ''secondary'' issues like the
environment, human rights, development, and foreign aid, Beijing could
''weaken some of the pressures that great powers use to squeeze China.''

#### US Hegemony prevents extinction

**Barnett 11** (Thomas P.M., Former Senior Strategic Researcher and
Professor in the Warfare Analysis & Research Department, Center for
Naval Warfare Studies, U.S. Naval War College American military
geostrategist and Chief Analyst at Wikistrat., worked as the Assistant
for Strategic Futures in the Office of Force Transformation in the
Department of Defense, "The New Rules: Leadership Fatigue Puts U.S., and
Globalization, at Crossroads,")

Events in Libya are a further reminder for [Americans]{.underline} that
we [stand at a crossroads in our continuing evolution as the world\'s
sole full-service superpower.]{.underline} Unfortunately**,** we are
increasingly seeking change without cost, and shirking from risk because
we are tired of the responsibility. We don\'t know who we are anymore,
and our president is a big part of that problem. Instead of leading us,
he explains to us. Barack Obama would have us believe that he is
practicing strategic patience. But many experts and ordinary citizens
alike have concluded that he is actually beset by strategic incoherence
\-- in effect, a man overmatched by the job. It is worth first examining
the larger picture: We live in a time of arguably the greatest
structural change in the global order yet endured, with this historical
moment\'s most amazing feature being its relative and absolute lack of
mass violence. That is something to consider when Americans contemplate
military intervention in Libya, because if we do take the step to
prevent larger-scale killing by engaging in some killing of our own, we
will not be adding to some fantastically imagined global death count
stemming from the ongoing \"megalomania\" and \"evil\" of American
\"empire.\" We\'ll be engaging in the same sort of system-administering
activity that has marked our stunningly successful stewardship of global
order since World War II. Let me be more blunt: [[As the guardian of
globalization, the U.S.]{.mark} military [has been the greatest force
for peace]{.mark} the world has ever known[. Had America been
removed]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [the]{.mark} global dynamics that governed
the [20th]{.mark} [century]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} mass [murder never
would have ended.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Indeed, it\'s entirely
conceivable [there would]{.mark} now [be no]{.mark} identifiable human
[civilization]{.mark} left[, once nuclear weapons entered]{.mark} the
killing equation[.]{.mark} But the world did not keep sliding down that
path of perpetual war. Instead, [America]{.mark} stepped up and [changed
everything by]{.mark} ushering in our now-perpetual [great-power
peace.]{.mark} We introduced the international liberal trade order known
as globalization and played loyal Leviathan over its spread. [What
resulted was]{.mark} the collapse of empires[, an explosion of
democracy, the]{.mark} persistent [spread of]{.mark} human
[rights,]{.mark} the [liberation of women,]{.mark} the [doubling of life
expectancy, a]{.mark} roughly [10-fold increase in]{.mark} adjusted
[global GDP and a]{.mark} profound and persistent [reduction in battle
deaths from]{.mark} state-based [conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is
what American \"hubris\" actually delivered. Please remember that the
next time some TV pundit sells you the image of \"unbridled\" American
military power as the cause of global disorder instead of its cure. With
self-deprecation bordering on self-loathing, we now imagine a
post-American world that is anything but. Just watch who scatters and
who steps up as the Facebook revolutions erupt across the Arab world.
While we might imagine ourselves the status quo power, we remain the
world\'s most vigorously revisionist force. As for the sheer \"evil\"
that is our military-industrial complex, again, let\'s examine what the
world looked like before that establishment reared its ugly head. The
last great period of global structural change was the first half of the
20th century, a period that saw a death toll of about 100 million across
two world wars. That comes to an average of 2 million deaths a year in a
world of approximately 2 billion souls. Today, with far more
comprehensive worldwide reporting, researchers report an average of less
than 100,000 battle deaths annually in a world fast approaching 7
billion people. [Though admittedly crude, these calculations suggest a
90 percent absolute drop and a 99 percent relative drop in deaths due to
war. We are clearly headed for a world order characterized by
multipolarity, something the American-birthed system was designed to
both encourage and accommodate. But given how things turned out the last
time we collectively faced such a fluid structure, we would do well to
keep U.S. power, in all of its forms, deeply embedded in the geometry to
come.]{.underline} To continue the historical survey, after salvaging
Western Europe from its half-century of civil war, the U.S. emerged as
the progenitor of a new, far more just form of globalization \-- one
based on actual free trade rather than colonialism. America then
successfully replicated globalization further in East Asia over the
second half of the 20th century, setting the stage for the Pacific
Century now unfolding.

#### Arms limitation is an enforcement mechanism for a broader structure of military domination. They reflect the hegemonic discourse of the status quo, where restrictions like the MTCR are used as regulatory mechanisms to maintain the Pax Americana of the US empire. This empire has created a network of activities like arms control that both operate within and reinforce the conceptual framework of liberal militarism.

Others have been less sympathetically critical. For Neil Cooper,
initiatives like the ATT 'do not represent a novel post-Cold War
development that symbolizes progress on an emancipatory human security
agenda'. 14 **[Post-Cold War [arms trade]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[regulation]{.underline}** **[has been based on a 'discourse
around]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**humanitarianism, [human security and
weapons precision' that has served to legitimise]{.mark}** high-tech
**[military technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.15 Cooper and others
emphasise the deep historical roots of the way [[humanitarian impulses
intersect with economic and security ones]{.underline}]{.mark},
including in late nineteenth-century efforts to regulate the supply and
circulation of weapons in the imperial peripheries that are remarkably
resonant with contemporary efforts.16 Historically minded scholars
remind us that [surplus and obsolete weapons have long circulated in the
peripheries of empire]{.underline}, and new weapons tested there; and
political authorities were licensing weapons exports as early as the
sixteenth century -- in part to avoid blowback.17 **[[Arms trade
regulation,]{.underline}]{.mark}** then, **[[has
a]{.underline}]{.mark}** 'historically [**contingent' [character, marked
by the ongoing importance of 'power, ]{.mark}**interest**[, economy,
security']{.mark}**]{.underline}. 18 Militarism emerges as a core
concern out of such critiques and provides the jumping-off point for
this analysis. In particular, there are long traditions of historical
sociological and feminist scholarship on militarism,19 defined here as
'the social and international relations of the preparation for, and
conduct of, organized political violence'. 20 In relation to arms
control, I have argued elsewhere that the [ATT has been mobilised by
liberal democratic states]{.underline} primarily [to legitimise their
arms transfer practices]{.underline}.21 And Cooper concludes that
**['campaigners need to return to a strategic contestation of global
militarism rather than searching for tactical campaign victories
dependent on accommodation with the language and economic and security
paradigms of contemporary military humanism']{.underline}**. 22 This is
part of a political economy critique of the way ['the regulation of
pariah weapons might alternatively be described as "arms control from
below within the logic of militarism from above"]{.underline}', 23 in
line with a wider critique of human security as having been
'institutionalised and co-opted to work in the interests of global
capitalism, militarism and neoliberal governance'. 24 Neil Cooper and
David Mutimer, surveying the history of and prospects for controlling
the means of violence, argue that 'the longer term, indirect effect
should be to reduce militarism and promote cultures of peace' or 'at the
very least, avoid further embedding cultures of militarism'. 25 How,
then, should we think about the impact of the human security agenda on
militarism, and vice versa; and what are the ramifications for weapons
control? From militarism to human security -- and back via the imperial
turn The 1994 UNDP Human Development Report, which formalised the human
security agenda, was explicit about the role of 'excessive
militarization and the international arms trade' as a 'critical source
of insecurity'. 26 Arising from 'the world's previous preoccupation with
deterrence and territorial security', arms transfers, military
assistance, proxy wars, excessive military spending, politicised
militaries in developing countries, and the military-industrial complex,
were all identified as impediments to the realisation of human
security.27 The report identified concrete policy recommendations,
including an international agreement to phase out military assistance; a
list of prohibited items for transfer; a strengthened UN Register
reporting system; the regulation and elimination of subsidies; and a tax
on arms sales to finance peacekeeping.28 Such moves, alongside increased
spending on demilitarisation efforts, were envisaged as 'an important
step towards achieving human security'. 29 While there was an emphasis
on 'Third World disarmament', the report was clear that this must be one
component of a 'blueprint for global disarmament'. 30 So here we have an
agenda for practical action on the weapons trade, challenging militarism
to improve human security. The UNDP report identified the nation-statist
ideologies of deterrence and territorial security, as well as the
transnational practices of military assistance and proxy wars, as key
causes of insecurity. Simultaneously, it reopened the debate about the
link between security and development 'that had been closed since the
somewhat sterile polemic around the link between disarmament and
development' of the 1970s and 1980s.31 This earlier, now ostensibly
out-dated debate surmised that 'the North (that is, both sides of the
East--West conflict) should disarm, and devote the resources freed up by
arms reduction to development in the South'. 32 As part of this shift in
debate, the move away from state-centred definitions of security was
accompanied by an acknowledgment of the legitimate and crucial role of
the state in providing security -- especially as security was emphasised
as a precondition for development. So the anti-militarist call that
identified the state as a creator of insecurity was balanced against
recognition of the legitimate role of the state in providing security.
There was also a downgrading of military threats as a particular type of
threat to human security: military threats do not appear as one of the
seven main categories articulated in the report (economic, food, health,
environmental, personal, community, political). Rather, threats from war
(defined as 'threats from other states') are listed under the category
of 'personal security', alongside threats of physical torture and ethnic
tension, as well as crime, rape, domestic violence, and suicide.33 The
analytical and political move made in the 1994 UNDP Report was to equate
war with the state and move away from a concern with territorially based
definitions of security and inter-state war, which it equates with
militarism. There is a shift in focus to the spectrum of armed violence
and non-conflict violence, which are to be remedied in the name of human
security, in part through the (re)construction of legitimate coercive
apparatuses. The shift away from militarism and towards human security
claims to acknowledge the changing character of conflict and the role of
the state in monopolising legitimate violence, without privileging it
unthinkingly. Research in this vein has flourished in the years since
the 1994 report, and brings significant advantages to bear over
traditional state-centric analyses, such as the ability to account for
the geographical diversity of rates of armed violence within as well as
between states; sustained and distinct attention to gendered patterns of
violence, including the specific character of femicide as a distinct
form of violence; and the incorporation of questions of public health
and socioeconomic inequality into discussion about weapons transfers.34
For all these developments, the human security agenda's take on war,
conflict, and armed violence has not been without its critics. It has
been described as the 'new orthodoxy' that is 'unable to provide the
basis for a substantive change of the system of international security',
despite finding 'the old language of interstate war and conflict ...
lacking'. 35 Similarly, its emphasis on 'progressive' initiatives such
as 'eliminat\[ing\] certain types of weapons' stands accused of failing
to adequately examine 'the pathologies inherent in the structure of the
international system' that generate such challenges.36 And when the
'human' in human security is naturalised as masculine, the inclusion of
novel threats and new actors leaves the parameters of security
untouched, meaning that 'state-based, militarised security remains
unchallenged'. 37 Feminist scholars have critiqued the gendered concepts
and practices of war, peace, militarisation, peacekeeping and
soldiering, going well beyond the human security framework in the
process.38 Feminist critiques that challenge the parameters of human
security can usefully be combined with postcolonial accounts of IR that
emphasise the ways in which the discipline 'can both deny empire while
simultaneously normalizing an imperial perspective on the world'. 39
Some of the main themes of the human security agenda are illustrative of
the need for an imperial perspective in how we understand the challenges
facing weapons control. By this I mean interpreting them with the aid of
scholarship that challenges methodological nationalism and Eurocentrism
in its analysis, mobilises feminist critiques of militarism, and puts
the legacy of empire and colonialism, and the racial, gendered, and
classed politics of imperial control, front and centre in its assessment
of contemporary challenges.40 Deploying such resources gives us a chance
to rethink some of the key assumptions around human security and the
prospects for regulating weapons circulation. Three core themes of the
human security agenda are ripe for an imperial critique. First, the
claim that the character of conflict has changed, from inter-state war
towards internal conflict, has become axiomatic in much of IR, including
the human security literature.41 The greatest threats to human security
are deemed to stem from internal conflict and criminal violence, or the
state itself, rather than from an external adversary as per the
traditional security agenda. As such, 'international security
traditionally defined -- territorial integrity -- does not necessarily
correlate with human security'. 42 Second, the changing character of
conflict requires a shift in the referent object of security, according
to the human security agenda: away from the state and inter-state war,
and towards the individual and the broader range of threats they face.
43 And third, **[[the human security agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}**
nonetheless **[[emphasises]{.mark} the importance of [the state's
monopoly on]{.mark} [legitimate violence]{.mark} and role in security
provision]{.underline}**.44 Yet the circumstances have been transformed
with the end of the Cold War. Kaldor attributes a 'profound
restructuring of political authority' to the new wars, and sees human
security as an opportunity for 'reconstructing political authority in
the context of the processes we call globalisation'. 45 Hence the need
for security sector reform (SSR), demobilisation, disarmament, and
reintegration (DDR) and other reforms of coercive practices and
apparatuses. Each of these three themes is premised on the significance
of the rupture that occurred with the end of the Cold War. But
understanding the Cold War as predominantly an East--West ideological
and geopolitical confrontation marginalises longer historical patterns
of North--South power relations and conflict, and of hot war in the
South. And the **[[increased focus on internal
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while fruitful in terms of changing the
scale of analysis, **[[risks disconnecting the micropolitics of violence
from broader]{.mark} systems and [structures of war
preparation]{.mark},]{.underline}** ignoring one of the key lessons of
feminist scholarship, which is that the scales or so-called levels of
analysis are interdependent. As Laura Sjoberg and Sandra Via put it,
'absolutely distinguishing between the personal, national and
international level of war and militarism lacks conceptual and empirical
rigor at best': feminist attention allows us to understand both the
impact of war and militarism on people (especially, but not only, women)
as well as the gendered construction of war and militarism.46 A longer
historical view that is not hamstrung by a state-centric ontology allows
us to see that arms transfer practices have long been part of the
simultaneously transnational and asymmetrical constitution of force.
Historical scholarship on the arms trade emphasises the importance of
decolonisation as the shift from empire to a system of formally
sovereign states in which North-- South power asymmetries continue to
resonate. One of the key transformations in weapons transfer practices
that came with decolonisation was a shift on the part of the Soviet
Union and China from support for national liberation movements, to the
defence of sovereignty as a means of resisting US-led domination, in
either anti-capitalist or anti-imperialist modes.47 The supply of
weapons and military training was a common feature of both Soviet and US
relations with the Third World: despite their differences, North--South
politico-military relations had much in common between the two blocs.48
Ostensibly new or transformed challenges of the post-Cold War era, such
as Somali piracy, new wars in Africa, or insurgency and
counterinsurgency in Afghanistan, are thus better understood in
postcolonial terms, with militarised transnational continuities as well
as changes associated with the end of superpower rivalry.49 Amina Mama
and Margo Okazawa-Rey emphasise the continuities between colonial and
contemporary militarism that not only led them to prefer the terminology
of postcolonial conflicts over that of new wars, but also emphasise the
fundamentally gendered characteristics of the physical and structural
violence at stake.50 And as Cooper argues, arms control regimes have
long featured both 'proscription and permission' operating in tandem,
challenging the optimism of accounts premised on the end of the Cold War
as the changed permissive factor that allows humanitarian concerns to be
the core objective of weapons control. This emphasis on history and
power generates scepticism about the optimism and presentism of most
accounts of the emergence of the ATT, and the linear, benevolent account
of history found therein.52 A longer historical perspective allows us to
see how **[state security]{.underline}** (whether national or imperial)
**[and]{.underline}** (what is today called) **[human security have long
been two sides of the same coin. [There are]{.mark}]{.underline}** thus
**[[continuities of imperial forms of practice despite the turn]{.mark}
to formal sovereignty]{.underline}**. A focus on the systematic or
organised and North--South character of much armed violence is not to
return to Cold War politics or the 'sterile polemic' of past debates
about weapons issues mentioned earlier. Rather, it is to emphasise that
**[[historical weapons supply routes and power relations continue to

**[[clients continue to use weapons in ways that

**[[unanticipated]{.underline}]{.mark}** by patrons. Ostensibly civil or
internal wars are enmeshed in wider regional and international
projects.53 There are internationalised sources of much of what counts
as domestic, civil or intra-state, including colonial legacies and
internationalised weapons supply chains. In many accounts, [human
security has been mobilised as an attempt to 'cope with \[the\]
pathological results' of how security has been defined]{.underline} in
postcolonial states in the South.54 Yet this encourages internalist
analysis that sees the problems of armed violence as having their
sources primarily within the global South. **[[In conceding the terms of
debate to 'traditional' security]{.underline}]{.mark}** studies, **[and
seeking to shift inwards from the state]{.underline}** to the
individuals living within it, **[[rather than critiquing the conception
of the international system,]{.mark} the [human security]{.mark} agenda
[continues to]{.mark} 'occlude and [distort imperial relations']{.mark}
in the way that more traditional 'Westphalian terms of reference'
do]{.underline}**.55 In the human security agenda's account of the shift
from wars between states to wars within them, war falls off the agenda
as it is deemed analytically outdated and politically regressive. Yet
neo-realist, Cold War accounts of national security were never adequate,
and in trying to overcome them, many human security accounts take them
at face value and get the critique wrong. With its emphasis on the
enduring power of war preparation, the concept of militarism suggests
that much contemporary violence remains coordinated or facilitated (by
state, paramilitary, militia, or other organised actors), and systematic
within society, despite the shift towards discussion of armed violence
and intentional homicide, which is suggestive of disorganised violence.
So how are we to mobilise the concept of militarism in light of the
imperial turn, in ways that help us think more productively about
weapons control? First is to defend the use of the concept at all.
According to Mary Kaldor, the concept of militarism has outlived its
usefulness as it is 'drawn from the Cold War and before': the changes
with the end of the Cold War necessitate new terms.56 To capture the
ways that organised violence blurs state/non-state and national/foreign
boundaries, whether in the form of paramilitary groups, organised crime
or terrorist cells, or in the form of peacekeeping troops, Kaldor coins
the terms 'Netforce' and 'Protectionforce' respectively.57 Kaldor
restricts the concept of militarism to 'the new American militarism' and
the 'neo-modern militarism' ('the evolution of classical military forces
in large transition states' practising inter-state war or
counterinsurgency) of states such as Russia, China, and India.58 But in
differentiating some types of organised violence as not-militarism, we
lose the opportunity to compare them, to see the overlaps, similarities,
and differences in modes of organised violence. Feminists have long been
able to capture this with the concept of militarism, showing us that 'it
is not quite so easy to set aside "ordinary" aggression, force or
violence as "not war"'59 -- especially when we pay attention to the
experience of violence in the global South.60 Second, and relatedly, the
specificities of combinations of actors, degrees of state support, and
so on, are subject to empirical and historical specificity, and a common
rubric of militarism helps us understand similarities and differences
between them. Working in a historical sociological tradition, Bryan
Mabee and Srdjan Vucetic draw up a typology of forms of contemporary
militarism.61 They contrast Michael Mann's concept of civil society
**[militarism -- 'the use of organized military violence in pursuit of
social goals that is "state-supported]{.underline}**, but not
state-led"'62 -- to 'nation-state militarism' in both its authoritarian
and liberal forms; to 'neoliberal militarism' structured around
socioeconomic liberalisation; and to **['exceptionalist militarism' seen
in practices associated with the War on Terror.]{.underline}** Feminists
tend not to operate in such formal typological ways, but have long been
articulating the idea of war and militarism as a spectrum or a system,
in which the forms, intensities, and characteristics may vary, but the
gendered basis of violence is central.63 And a focus on militarism can
be usefully mobilised to consider the connections and feedback loops
between Northern and Southern practices, giving a more internationalised
account that is better attuned to the operation of power in contexts of
armed violence. Indeed, Rita Abrahamsen refers to 'global militarism in
Africa' because 'while militarism is always specific (and often
national), it is also simultaneously global', and the 'analytical
challenge is to capture at one and the same time the global and the
local, and their intersection in particular locations'. 64 Third, while
I want to defend the concept, and think about types of militarism in
relation to each other, it is crucial to acknowledge that contemporary
militarism and human security have shaped each other in the last twenty
years. Human security, with its emphasis on human rights and IHL, has
become a mediating element in the relation between war and society.
Post-Cold War processes of democratisation have 'often coincided with
new forms of militarism' that tend to be analysed under the rubric of
policy-oriented concepts such as security sector reform.65 As Abrahamsen
argues, 'The securitization of underdevelopment ... is the condition of
possibility for a global militarism justified in the name of human
security and development.' 66 We must take heed of Abrahamsen's warning
that 'Paradoxically, transformations that initially entailed a critique
of militarization and militarism have ended up according a new
importance to security actors and laying the groundwork for new
expressions of militarization and militarism.Human security has --
against its self-image as a progressive social force -- facilitated a
resurgent as well as transformed militarism. \[...\] The disagreements
and silences of the ATT negotiations demonstrate the ways in which
**[weapons]{.underline}** circulation and **[regulation are marked by
different forms of militarism]{.underline}**. The human security agenda
has made significant inroads to international public policy and social
science scholarship, and was an explicit driver of the ATT. While there
is much in the treaty that optimists see as having the potential to
better control the circulation of weapons, the argument put forward in
this article is that it is a mistake to see the treaty as a victory for
human security over militarism. Rather, [[human security]{.mark}
has]{.underline} chipped away at some of the most egregious
manifestations of militarism, been silent on others, and [[proved to be
an accommodation with global militarism]{.underline}]{.mark} in its
various forms. Human security, political economy and sovereignty came
into contestation during the negotiations as expressions of different
modes of militarism[. **[Weapons circulation takes places within a
system: there is a world arms market]{.underline}**]{.mark} (including
legal and illicit strands) **[[marked by]{.mark} asymmetry, [hierarchy,
and transnational practices,]{.mark} in which many major exporting
states that claim to care about human security]{.underline}**, in
particular European states, already participate in regimes based on
ATT-like principles. Those that don't, or are ambivalent about such
multilateralism -- in particular Russia and China, and the US,
respectively -- are sceptical about claims made on the basis of human
rights and IHL. **[[Claims to protect human security disconnect human
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}** and IHL violations **[[from]{.mark} these
[patterns of military]{.mark} asymmetry and
[hierarchy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and generate resistance from
non-liberal suppliers and recipients. So **[[the human security agenda

militarised in one way]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([the absence of efforts
at disarmament or tackling military spending or military asymmetry)
**[and]{.mark}**]{.underline} yet be **[[demilitarised in

#### Vote neg to problematize the virtuous presumption of 1AC's particulars thru [anti-colonial critique]{.underline} -- the task of the IR scholar is to expose how the ethical contours of IR have been settled by historical denial of violence

**Inayatullah and Blaney 17** (Naeem, Professor - Department of Politics
@ Ithaca College; David, G. Theodore Mitau Professor of Political
Science @ Macalester College. "Constructivism and the Normative
Dangerous Liaisons?" *Against International Norms.* Editor - Charlotte
Epstein, Taylor Francis)

A similar tactic and ambiguity is found in [Risse]{.underline} (1999,
530), who [distinguishes three modes of action that facilitate the
progressive [internalization of norms]{.mark}: 'forced imposition,'
habituation, [and]{.mark} 'processes of [moral consciousness
raising]{.mark}, argumentation, dialogue, and persuasion'.]{.underline}
At the outset, he admits that we find [these modes]{.underline} combined
-- that 'moral consciousness raising,' the mode he wishes to stress,
['[rarely takes place in a power vacuum]{.mark}']{.underline} (Risse
1999, 531). [Yet he argues that the role of power is not ubiquitous but
an empirical question]{.underline} (Risse 1999, 536). In that open and
inquiring spirit, [he argues that [norm internalization
functions]{.mark} as]{.underline} dialogue or [persuasion [where actors
share a]{.mark} 'common lifeworld']{.underline}, a set of common values
or a collective history. [He names this space of relatively noncoercive
argument and persuasion a [global public sphere]{.mark}]{.underline} (
Risse 1999 , 534). [The empirical debate]{.underline}, then, [concerns
whether the international system looks like a public sphere, but the
power it takes to create a global public sphere is not discussed. Nor do
we hear much about the exclusions necessary to the constitution of its
norms]{.underline} (see Bially Mattern 2005 ). To his credit, Price
admits that the advancement of norms may carry a darker side, but the
admission is thin. In return for this admission, he asks that critics
accept the progressive side of modernity (207). [What he does not admit
into the discussion is that [this]{.mark} kind of trade
[requires]{.mark} the [erasure of alternative modes of life]{.mark} and
their ethical visions [in return for the advantages of
modernity]{.mark}. [If we readmitted this 'erasure']{.mark} into the
exchange, [the debate about]{.mark} European [colonization becomes
central to]{.mark} the discussion of norms -- [socialization]{.mark} and
the character [of a global public sphere]{.mark}]{.underline}. [No
longer could the privilege of norm constructivists be secured through
truncating a more basic historical discussion]{.underline}. And no
longer could the critics of norms constructivism be dismissed as
relativists. Informed by a broader historical discussion, we might
arrive at a different account of the ethical contours of the world.
[There is not one world of ethical possibility to which we need refer,
but many worlds]{.underline} (we gloss Walker 1988 ). If the genocidal
violence of modernity has not been absolute, we might highlight the
'cultural complexity' of global ethical life: competing visions for
constructing global social and political space form and circulate within
and across complex cultural terrains ( Hannerz 1992 ). [These visions
overlap and interact, [containing]{.mark} multiple [dominant and
recessive voices]{.mark}]{.underline} ( Nandy 1987 , 12--18). And,
importantly, processes of cultural differentiation and interaction have
entailed relations of domination and subordination ( Appadurai 1996 ,
23, 46, 64). If so, the ethical vision of modernity is 'settled' only by
active forgetting or the continual violent erasure and/or subordination
of alternative visions. So that, for example, the process by which
slaves imagine their freedom and redeem themselves remains obscured by
the abolitionists' definition of legal freedom ( Shilliam 2013 ) or the
protests of those of African descent against the complicity of a liberal
order of rights in their subservience disappears from the official
accounts of human rights norms diffusion ( Grovogui 2011 ).
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} empirical/ethical [[task of the IR
scholar]{.underline}]{.mark} likewise [[begins to]{.mark}
look]{.underline} quite [different]{.underline}. [We would [investigate
how]{.mark} modern [institutions and practices create]{.mark} domination
and [subordination]{.mark}. We would explore the way the [ethical
contours]{.mark} of modern international society [have been 'settled'
by]{.mark} acts of [violence and]{.mark} remain settled by acts of
[historical denial]{.mark}]{.underline}. We would explore the
implications of alternative visions of globality or the international
that challenge the contours of modernity, but this requires thinking
beyond the temporality of the modern, in which existing alternatives
have been rendered impossible by being displaced into the past ( Blaney
and Inayatullah 2010 ; Hutchings 2008 , Chapter 7 ). We would treat
international relations as an exploration of difference (see Inayatullah
and Blaney 2004 ). [[This is not ethical paralysis]{.mark}, [though it
does remove]{.mark} the ethical sheen and [virtuous presumption]{.mark}
from norms constructivism]{.underline}. Price does allow domination of
the world by a modern consciousness to find a way into his account. [But
he inserts the critics of colonial imposition into a role in a debate
between relativism and universalism, where the modern stands in as the
universal, which is always vindicated in the face of the particularity
of the critics.]{.underline} Beyond this move, Price provides little
basis for choosing the universalized modern as the basis for ethical
judgment in international society. The only way out of this problem for
Price is to appeal to a standard of ethics from beyond the theories and
practices of IR -- to an unimpeachable standard verified on
philosophical grounds. He seems to recognize that this is impossible,
but one can sense the appeal such a position holds for him (and for
norms constructivists in general; see Hoffman 2009 , 243). In the end,
Price cannot give full play to [an [anti-colonial
critique]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[would imperil]{.mark} the [ethical
heroism]{.mark} of norms constructivism]{.underline}. Nor can he
acknowledge colonial violence as a necessary cost of his ethical
heroism. [This would require admitting that he has imported an entire
theory of history, [with]{.mark} all [its teleological alibis for
death]{.mark} and destruction. [Coming clean]{.mark} with such a theory
of history [would push]{.mark} norms constructivists into [a
debate]{.mark} with critics [in which the ethical/scientific privilege
of]{.mark} the [constructivists would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[be
undermined]{.mark}. Such a debate would turn on how we understand
history]{.underline}. (29-30)

### CP

#### Plan: The United States federal government should substantially increase its Direct Commercial Sales of unpiloted aerial vehicles

#### pullout of the Missile Technology Control Regime;

#### increase funding for hypersonic missiles and space debris clean up tech

#### Drones are a stabilizing force

**Horowitz, Kreps, Fuhrmann**, 1-25-**2016** (Michael C., Sarah E.,
Matthew, professor of political science at the University of
Pennsylvania, American political scientist who has written extensively
on drones and drone warfare, and professor of political science at the
University of Pennsylvania respectively, "The Consequences of Drone
Proliferation: Separating Fact from Fiction") (CB)

B**[eyond the use of drones in ongoing military conflicts is the
question of how UAV deployments may influence stability in contested
regions of the world]{.underline}**. Precisely **[because soldiers'
lives are not directly at risk, [pessimists about drone proliferation
fear that states might take crossborder actions with fewer
reservations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} **[which could be
particularly destabilizing in areas where countries are already prone to
mistrust,]{.underline}** such as the East and South China Seas. Michael
Boyle argues, for instance, "The risks of a conflict spiral arising from
the shoot-down of the drone or an accident of some kind in the East
China Sea are real and potentially dangerous."93 Despite the technical
limitations of armed drones, it is nonetheless possible that a state
might attempt to carry out drone strikes on an adversary's territory,
potentially triggering a crisis if the UAV is shot down. **[It is more
likely, however, [that countries would use drones for persistent
surveillance in a contested area]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Indeed, this is
a case where unarmed drones could carry significant, possibly salutary
implications for international security. **[[Most]{.mark} international
[disputes arise from border disputes]{.mark},94 where [the primary risk
of escalation]{.mark} on a regular basis [comes from
miscommunication]{.mark} and misinterpretation]{.underline}**, **[rather
than a deliberate decision to change the status quo.]{.underline}** In
the maritime arena alone, there are more than 430 bilateral boundaries
that are not governed by formal agreements. **[[States concerned with
upholding their claims]{.mark} in these boundary areas [might be]{.mark}
especially [drawn to using drones for]{.mark} persistent
[surveillance]{.mark} 24 due to the technology's superior endurance, and
because [states could literally "test the waters"]{.mark} with less risk
than would be incurred with a manned equivalent]{.underline}**.95
Moreover, the ability to substitute robots for people might make
countries more likely to deploy drones into contested regions and behave
more assertively, because the costs of losing them seem lower.96 If
deployments move from close-to-the-border to inside an adversary's
territory, there is some risk of triggering an armed confrontation. The
deployment of drones could increase the risk of accidents and unintended
clashes in this context. **[When one state deploys UAVs, the other side
may not clearly understand whether the drones are intended for offensive
or defensive purposes.97 This uncertainty may cause a state to adopt
worst-case thinking, potentially leading to a forceful
response.]{.underline}** **[The likelihood of using force increases
insofar as a pilot or captain knows that his or her actions would not
result in another individual being killed.]{.underline}** **[China, for
example, is reported to have a policy of shooting down unannounced
drones with surface-to-air missiles or fighter aircraft.98 Compounding
matters further, the rules of engagement for responding to drone
incursions -- whether and when to shoot down a drone that transgresses
borders -- are currently ambiguous. This could create a vacuum in terms
of mutual understandings and lead to escalation]{.underline}**.
**[Consider]{.underline}**, for example, **[the numerous incidents that
have spilled into the public sphere concerning the United States
military and the Chinese military over the last few decades, including
the EP-3 incident in 2001, the confrontation between a Chinese naval
frigate and the USNS Impeccable in 2013, and the reported near miss
between a US surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet in
2014]{.underline}**.99 The spate of Russian air incursions into NATO
airspace in the Baltic Sea region likewise underscore the potential for
diplomatic incidents resulting from military deployments. During 2014,
Russia conducted over 400 patrols in the region, corresponding with
deteriorating **[With long-range drones added to the mix, the number of
incursions into NATO airspace could significantly escalate as the costs
of incursion decrease for Russia]{.underline}**. The potentially
destabilizing consequences could be more intense because of the unclear
rules of engagement that attend the use of armed drones.101 **[The above
arguments certainly have some merit. However, [it is important not to
overstate the risk of drone deployments for]{.mark} regional or
international [stability]{.mark}. [None of the aforementioned
incidents]{.mark} actually [led to armed military
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} On the contrary, **[emerging
norms on the consequences of shooting down a drone, though clearly still
in the early stages, suggest that states distinguish between when manned
and unmanned systems are shot down]{.underline}**. **[Thus, [even if
accidents happen]{.mark} in these types of situations]{.underline}**,
**[[they are less likely to trigger crises or escalation]{.mark} than
the pessimistic view implies]{.underline}**. For example, when Pakistan
shot down an Indian surveillance drone in the Kashmir region in summer
2015 that it said strayed beyond the line of control, India did not
escalate the long-simmering conflict to war.102 Similarly, compare the
muted international discussion when Turkey shot down a drone flying on
its border with Syria in fall 2015 with the diplomatic crisis between
Turkey and Russia that erupted when Turkey shot down a manned SU-24.103
Countries appear to know that opponents will value drones differently
than manned aircraft, and behave accordingly, meaning that drones
carrying out surveillance and reconnaissance missions need not be
destabilizing, as long as all actors hold the same views about shooting
down drones. This may not always be the case since, as noted previously,
the rules of engagement in this context are not clearly defined.
**[There are reasons to think that [using drones for surveillance
could]{.mark} actually [be stabilizin]{.mark}]{.underline}**[g]{.mark}.
**[[Drones could give both sides]{.mark} in a dispute [real-time
info]{.mark}rmation [about the situation at lower cos]{.mark}t, and with
lower risk to personnel, than is possible at present]{.underline}**.
**[This is especially true since countries can use drones deployed near
or at their borders to "see" into contested areas or even their 26
adversaries' territory more persistently with drones. [This could reduce
the risk of conflict]{.mark}, for two reasons. First, [the state
deploying a drone to a contested area for surveillance purposes will
have more information]{.mark}. Assuming that its enemy is not planning
to launch an attack, this information could reduce fears of
aggression]{.underline}**, **[potentially reducing the risk of
destabilizing countermeasures. Second, [the existence of surveillance
drones could decrease the ability of potential aggressors to conduct
surprise attacks or covert activitie]{.mark}s.]{.underline}** With
surveillance drones operating near the border, an adversary may observe
military deployments, allowing it to take appropriate preparations.
**[[Drones, then, may be useful for deterrence by
denial]{.mark}:]{.underline}**104 if the potential aggressor believed
that the element of surprise was critical to operational success, and
that drones flying near the border would give the other state adequate
notice, they may be less likely to launch an attack. Both of these
mechanisms could reinforce stability, even when their relative impact is
small.

#### Hypersonic Missile spending are key to holding the line against China and maintain US heg

David **Brennan**, **7-5**-2019, \"China\'s hypersonic missiles: How
worried should the U.S. be about futuristic weapons?,\" Newsweek, \<span

©B

A **[recent propaganda]{.underline}** video **[released by the Chinese
military has brought one of the country\'s most advanced
a]{.underline}**nd threatening **[technologies]{.underline}** **[back to
the fore---hypersonic weaponry.]{.underline}**

**[[[Hypersonic
weapons](https://www.newsweek.com/what-are-hypersonic-weapons-and-why-darpa-so-concerned-about-stopping-them-1212892) travel
at incredible speed and]{.mark}---unlike even the most advanced
ballistic missiles---[can maneuver in flight]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
This gives the weapons enormous range and makes them much harder to
track and stop.

**[The U.S., Russia and China are all investing heavily in hypersonic
technologies]{.underline}**. However, **[[the Pentagon has been]{.mark}
the [slow]{.mark}est [to jump on the bandwagon]{.mark} and [military
chiefs are warning that the [U.S. could be left
behind](https://www.newsweek.com/us-no-longer-safe-advanced-russian-and-chinese-weapons-general-warns-1095536)]{.mark}]{.underline}** by
its authoritarian adversaries, at least when it comes to nuclear-capable
hypersonics.

The U.S. still maintains by far the most powerful military on Earth,
supported by a military budget larger than that of the next seven
biggest spending nations combined. As such, America\'s rivals must
consider intelligent methods of leveling the playing field and---at
least on a local or regional level---**[[upending]{.mark} long-held
[U.S.]{.mark} military [heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline}**.

This is especially true for China, where the government has invested
huge sums in bringing its outdated military up to scratch. Beijing is
rapidly transitioning to a potent modern force, but one still inferior
to the U.S.

Nonetheless, **[military spending has been [geared towards exploiting
U.S.
weaknesses](https://www.newsweek.com/china-military-technology-parity-us-report-research-investment-pentagon-1442565) and
dominating East Asia]{.underline}**. Beijing is hoping that its
hypersonic weapons will form a key element in this [disruptive
strategy](https://www.newsweek.com/here-are-future-weapons-will-threaten-america-1262925).

**[There are two types of hypersonic weapon---cruise missiles (HCMs) and
glide vehicles (HGVs). Both are able to travel at speeds of Mach 1 or
higher]{.underline}**---**[around 3,800 miles per hour---and can
maneuver during flight]{.underline}**. This makes them difficult to
shoot down, but also means it is very difficult to predict what target
they will hit.

**[HGVs are launched by a ballistic missile, but the hypersonic
component itself does not have an engine. HCMs can be launched by other
vehicles such as fighter jets or naval vessels, and power themselves
with internal engines]{.underline}**. Both weapons can be armed with
either nuclear or conventional warheads.

**[[China is working on]{.mark} both types of
[weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} According to Douglas Barrie, a
senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies, Beijing is within \"a few years\" of fielding an HGV.

China already fields a daunting missile arsenal, whether subsonic,
supersonic or ballistic. For enemies, this already challenging scenario
is exacerbated by the introduction of HGVs.

As Barrie told Newsweek, HGVs \"fly at an altitude not presently well
covered by radar systems, and given their speed also potentially cut
down reaction and decision time on the part of the defender. Were
\[China\] to go ahead and also field hypersonic cruise missiles then
this defensive picture would become only more complex.\"

\"Any system that reduces reaction and decision time is potentially
further destabilising,\" Barrie added. China\'s interest in HGVs in part
would seem to be driven by the desire to counter missile defence systems
that are already or could be deployed in the Indo-Pacific theatre.\"

**[[Hypersonic weapons will form a key element of Chinese]{.mark}
military [strategy.]{.mark} U.S. force projection depends on regional
bases and aircraft carriers]{.underline}**. As James Bosbotinis---the
co-CEO of U.K.-based JB Associates and an expert in maritime and aerial
security---explained, it is **[these \"high-value\" targets that
hypersonic weapons will focus on, particularly where evading
anti-missile defenses is required.]{.underline}**

\"**[Leadership facilities, key command and control centers, underground
facilities, air bases, time-critical targets such as mobile missile
launchers]{.underline}**\" and maritime targets will all be on the list,
Bosbotinis told Newsweek.

Once deployed, [**[the weapons will \"significantly enhance\" Chinese
strike capabilities in East]{.underline}**
**[Asia]{.underline}**]{.mark}, Bosbotinis continued. The DF-17 HGV
(known by the Pentagon as WU-17), for example, has a reported range of
between 1,118 and 1,553 miles. This system is expected to be operational
by 2020, at which point it will be the world\'s first HGV put into
service.

### Deterrence

#### **China needs to be deterred by the U.S.**

of the Washington Post and a political analyst with CNN. "To Avoid
Conflict, the United States Must Deter Chinese Aggression".

Despite what you may have read, [the United States' strategy toward
China does not entail launching another Cold War]{.underline}, imposing
a zero-sum game or even winning a "clash of civilizations." In fact, the
entire objective of the [Trump administration's]{.underline} Asia
[approach is to avoid outright conflict with China]{.underline}. But to
do that, Beijing must be deterred from continuing on its aggressive
path. The idea that the White House's new approach to confront China's
economic aggression and military expansion represents a "Cold War
mentality" is popular with pundits both
in [Washington](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/us-trade-hawks-exaggerate-chinas-threat/587536/) and
in [Beijing](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1150289.shtml). But that
accusation misunderstands what the United States is trying to do with
China. It also mistakenly absolves Beijing for its malign actions, which
the United States is trying to counter --- or, better yet, prevent. "A
competitive strategy isn't meant to take us to conflict," Adm. Philip S.
Davidson, the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told me during an
interview last weekend at the Shangri-La Dialogue, a security conference
in Singapore hosted by the International Institute for Strategic
Studies. "[[A competitive strategy is defined as a deterrence strategy,
to prevent conflict going forward.]{.mark}" The U.S. military is just
one part of the government that is trying to reorient away from decades
of focus on the Middle East and terrorism-related conflict to focus on
the strategic competition with China.]{.underline} [There's a widespread
recognition that China is accelerating its efforts to expand its
influence across its region and around the world.]{.underline} Davidson
said the goal of [U.S. military strategy in Asia is "to dissuade China
from pursuing their ambitions, which are centered on the first island
chain in the near term but are much more broadly and globally ambitious
in the long term."]{.underline} There's overwhelming evidence that
China's military expansion is spreading well beyond Asia. Last weekend,
the People's Liberation Army tested a new submarine-launched ballistic
missile that [drastically

Chinese naval ships have visited more countries in the past 28 months
than they did in the previous 28 years, Davidson said. At the Shangri-La
Dialogue, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe defended Beijing's
militarization of artificial features in the South China Sea --- which
has broken a promise made by Chinese President Xi Jinping and flouted
international law --- as a response to U.S. aggression. Wei also
criticized countries coming from "outside the region" to interfere in
Asian security and stability, a comment clearly directed at the United
States. Davidson said Wei's remarks show that China's leaders are
looking to overturn the "Free and Open Indo-Pacific" vision that
underpins the current order in the region and replace it with their own.
"They've made quite plain that they would like to supplant the U.S.-led
international order and lead one with Chinese characteristics," Davidson
said. "[[When you think about that, being led by a nation that has a
closed and authoritarian internal order, it's got to send a chill down
everybody's spine across the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}." That raises
the crucial question of whether China can be deterred, and how. Davidson
called for more investments in cyber defense, electronic warfare,
long-range precision fire, and integrated air and missile defense.

U.S. capabilities by rapidly developing the technologies needed to
"offset" the military advantages the United States has enjoyed for
decades. The report was written by former deputy defense secretary
Robert Work, who was in charge of the U.S. project to offset China's
technology during the Obama administration. "Chinese technological
capabilities are growing as rapidly as its economic power," the report
states. "The Soviets were never able to match, much less overcome,
America's technological superiority. The same may not be true for
China." Those who criticize U.S. policy on China argue that the United
States went looking for another enemy after the fall of the Soviet
Union. Some [point

unfortunate remarks by Kiron Skinner, the State Department's policy
planning director, who called the U.S.-China competition "a fight with a
really different civilization and ideology." That was an error, not a
defining statement on U.S. policy. The U.S.-China competition is
completely different from the Cold War for many reasons. China is more
economically integrated than was the Soviet Union. The world can't be
divided into two camps. The competition extends to technology and
commerce. But there is one lesson from the Cold War that can be applied
to China. [If the United States and its partners want to avoid a hot
war, [we must try to deter the authoritarian power from expanding
aggressively]{.mark} without pushback]{.underline}. One thing is clear:
China is not yet deterred. One thing is not clear: whether it can be.

#### US arms sales to Taiwan are key to deterrence

Drew **Thompson** **19** \[Former US Defense Department official
responsible for managing bilateral relations with China, Taiwan and
Mongolia, Visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of
Public Policy, National University of Singapore\], 7-15-19, \"US arms
sales shows Taiwan's security is non-tradeable,\" South China Morning

https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3018242/us-arms-sales-shows-taiwans-security-non-tradeable-us-and-key-its//AC

The Trump administration has notified the United States Congress of its
intent to sell 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and Stinger missiles worth US\$2.2
billion to Taiwan. While China has predictably reacted with outrage,
[[this latest arms sale reflects rational calculations by Taipei and
Washington]{.mark}, which concluded that this sale is firmly in their
respective interests.]{.underline} [Importantly, the notification makes
clear that Taiwan's security is not trade-bait in a grand bargain
between Washington and Beijing, but a notable indicator that the Trump
administration is faithfully implementing its Indo-Pacific strategy.
Taiwan's rationale to acquire new tanks and the air defenses to protect
them is clear. China's military has modernized and expanded rapidly and
President Xi Jinping has openly declared that the use of force to
reunify Taiwan with the mainland remains a policy option.]{.underline}
Investments by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in amphibious vessels,
heavy lift aircraft, attack helicopters, as well as long-range strike
capabilities, make the invasion of Taiwan an increasingly realistic
threat. To counter the PLA threat, it is necessary for Taiwan to
modernize its legacy force and develop new asymmetric capabilities. How
China's military upgrade, trade war are challenging US in Indo-Pacific
M1 Abrams tanks and Stingers, an improvement over the existing M60
Patton tanks bought in 1991, are intelligent military choices and an
integral component of Taiwan's "Overall Defense Concept". The vision, by
Taiwan's Chief of the General Staff Admiral Lee Hsi-ming, emphasizes
asymmetric and innovative capabilities, mobility and survivability, and
maximizing Taiwan's defensive advantages by improving its littoral
fighting capabilities[. [Taiwan's success at turning it into a
full-fledged military strategy and doctrine will be critical to its
ability to deter Beijing]{.mark}. The US calculus is more complex but
equally grounded in national interests.]{.underline} There are some who
tout the sale's economic benefits to US workers and the defense
industry. Others note that the weapons offered are short-range and
defensive, consistent with obligations under the Taiwan Relations Act.
These items will not upset the cross-strait military balance, nor change
the US-China political dynamic. [Most importantly, the weapons sale to
Taiwan is an important aspect of a political deterrence strategy. The
sale is a signal to Beijing of US commitment to Taiwan and to a peaceful
resolution of cross-strait differences --- this is perhaps the arms
sale's most valuable attribute.]{.underline} [The sale is also a
substantial indication to allies and partners in the region about US
commitment, dependability and willingness to stand up to China on behalf
of valued partners.]{.underline} It underpins the US Indo-Pacific
strategy, which emphasizes deepening relationships and improving the
military capabilities of partners and allies. [Beijing undoubtedly sees
this and the US Indo-Pacific strategy in a different light, but that
perspective misses the essence of the calculus. The Trump
administration's decision to sell tanks to Taiwan while negotiating the
US trade relationship with China reflects confidence, and a relentless
focus on US interests. It should also debunk theories that the US is
using Taiwan to contain or impair China.]{.underline} President Donald
Trump made concessions to President Xi at the G20 summit in Osaka,
Japan, to relieve US pressure on Huawei, purportedly to build trust and
support the US bargaining position in bilateral trade negotiations. This
makes sense. Trading Taiwan's security for economic concessions does
not. [Taiwan's security, deterring China's use of force, and the
peaceful resolution of the cross-strait conflict are key American
interests that cannot and should not be traded for soybeans or market
access. Taiwan arms sales have always been a factor in the US-China
relationship, and will continue to be central because until China
renounces the use of force and exclusively pursues peaceful means for
reconciliation, it remains squarely in the US national interest to
ensure that Taiwan can defend itself and manage cross-strait relations
from a position of relative security. This concept of supporting choices
that promote long-term peace and prosperity is at the core of the
Indo-Pacific strategy.]{.underline} The US Defense Department's report
on the Indo-Pacific strategy, released to coincide with the Shangri-La
Dialogue in Singapore in early June, stated it succinctly: "The United
States has a vital interest in upholding the rules-based international
order", which "includes a strong, prosperous and democratic Taiwan". The
US will undoubtedly have more opportunities to demonstrate its
commitment to Taiwan's security and the defense of allies and partners.
Taiwan has requested new F-16V fighter aircraft to replace its ageing
F-5 fighters, and that decision is reportedly pending. [[The Taiwan
factor in the US-China relationship will continue to be manageable so
long as the Trump administration focuses on its interests and continues
to recognize that Taiwan's security]{.mark} is not a tradeable
commodity, but an integral aspect of its Indo-Pacific
strategy.]{.underline}

#### Supporting Taiwan through arms sales effectively reduces the risk of war between China and Taiwan

Bradley **Bowman**, **&** Mikhael **Smits** **19** \[Bowman-Senior
director for the Center on Military and Political Power at the
Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Smits-Research analyst\],

At the G-20 summit this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping
may pressure U.S. President Donald Trump to halt a planned U.S. arms
deal with Taiwan. Xi may even offer a tantalizing (but unreliable)
concession on the trade dispute in return for concessions on Taiwan.
[[Accepting such an offer would undermine U.S. national security and the
democratic principles Americans support]{.mark}. Bullies tend to start
fights they think they can win, an important consideration when it comes
to deterring Beijing from aggression against Taiwan. Unfortunately, due
to China's massive military mobilization and Washington's past
reluctance to provide sufficient arms to Taiwan, the military balance of
power in the Taiwan Strait has shifted in Beijing's direction --- making
war there more likely. To begin reducing this risk, Washington would be
wise to follow through on delivery of the pending arms package for
Taiwan.]{.underline} Based on the hope that economic liberalization
would lead to political liberalization, Washington facilitated Beijing's
integration into the global economy. American support for China's entry
into the World Trade Organization epitomized this strategy.
Unfortunately, increased wealth did not launch an inexorable march
toward freedom in China. Instead, the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP,
used its financial windfall to fund a major military expansion, bully
its neighbors and attempt to push the U.S. out of the region. These
dynamics have been perhaps most pronounced in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan
is prosperous and democratic, which creates an uncomfortable contrast
for the CCP and an object of emulation for its subjects on the mainland.
As in Hong Kong, the people of Taiwan have grown accustomed to their
freedoms and are reluctant to give them up. Impatient --- and determined
to exert control over the island --- Beijing has employed political and
military means to isolate and intimidate Taiwan. First, Beijing has
pressed countries to cut ties with Taiwan. In 2018 alone, China
successfully pressured three more countries to sever Taiwanese
relations, leaving only 17 that recognize the island's government.
[[Taiwan's diplomatic isolation makes American support all the more
important]{.mark}.]{.underline} More dangerously, due primarily to its
extraordinary military buildup, Beijing is moving ever closer to an
ability to successfully invade the island. The U.S. Defense Department's
Indo-Pacific Strategy Report released this month notes that "China has
never renounced the use of military force against Taiwan, and continues
to develop and deploy advanced military capabilities needed for a
potential military campaign." Indeed, as demonstrated by an increased
number of military exercises near Taiwan, the report warns that the
People's Liberation Army is "preparing for a contingency to unify Taiwan
with the mainland by force." [In the past, Taiwan's superior technology
and geography gave Taiwan a military edge when it came to a potential
conflict in the strait. However, as the Pentagon noted, due to China's
military buildup, those advantages are now largely gone.]{.underline} In
fact, as the Defense Intelligence Agency's 2019 report on Chinese
military power assessed, "Beijing's longstanding interest to eventually
compel Taiwan's reunification with the mainland and deter any attempt by
Taiwan to declare independence has served as the primary driver for
China's military modernization." Simultaneously, based on an overzealous
and counterproductive desire in previous administrations to avoid
offending Beijing, Washington has often been reluctant to provide Taiwan
the arms it needed. Fearful to not provoke the Chinese, the Obama
administration rejected Taiwanese requests for 66 new F-16 fighter
jets --- instead only offering modifications for its aging aircraft.
Admittedly, America's arms sales to Taiwan are relatively modest
compared to China's military buildup[. However[, the failure to provide
Taiwan the required weapons exacerbated the shift toward Beijing in the
military balance]{.mark}. As a result, across most combat domains,
Beijing has established both a quantitative and qualitative advantage
over Taiwan.]{.underline} Consequently, there is a risk that Beijing
planners and decision-makers might determine they could launch a
successful offensive against Taiwan. That perception in Beijing makes
aggression in the strait and a war with the United States more likely.
[The bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission listed aggression
against Taiwan as a top concern, arguing that allowing China to absorb
Taiwan by military force would constitute a "crushing blow to America's
credibility and regional position."]{.underline} In addition to genuine
hard-power concerns, there is also a matter of principle. When an
authoritarian power threatens and bullies a democratic people, America
is not neutral. Furthermore, providing Taiwan the means to defend itself
is not just consistent with sound policy and good principle --- it is
the law. The Taiwan Relations Act made clear that the establishment of
diplomatic relations with Beijing rested on the expectation that the
future of Taiwan would be "determined by peaceful means." To make this a
reality, the law says the U.S. will provide the weapons "necessary to
enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability."
Admittedly, successive U.S. administrations have interpreted and
implemented this rather vague statute differently. However, what seems
clear is that Taiwan's ability to defend itself against an increasingly
belligerent and capable military threat from the mainland is in doubt.
That would suggest that the current arms package under consideration is
not only permissible and advisable under the law, but essential. The
administration deserves credit for expanding freedom of navigation
operations in the Taiwan Strait and, at least initially, asking Congress
to support new arms sales to Taiwan. Those are good first steps, but
they are not enough. In addition to providing these arms without delay
and stopping the erosion of U.S. military superiority vis-a-vis China,
Washington should also provide Taiwan the fighter aircraft and other
weapons it needs to make Beijing think twice before undertaking
aggression in the strait. In its report this month, the
Pentagon reiterated the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's self-defense,
invoking the words of the Taiwan Relations Act. Those are good words.
But in any potential conversation with President Xi this week, President
Trump would do well to remember that it will take more than words to
deter aggression from the bullies in Beijing.

cruise missile saturation attacks against aircraft carrier groups may
begin to seem normal. However, one particular graphic from the October
2015 issue (p. 32) of the naval journal Naval & Merchant Ships
\[舰船知识\] stands out as both unusual and singularly disturbing. It
purports to **[map [the impact of a Chinese intercontinental ballistic
missile (ICBM) strike]{.mark} by twenty nuclear-armed rockets against
the United States.]{.underline}**

[Targets include the biggest cities on the East and West Coasts, as well
as in the Midwest, as one would expect. Giant radiation plumes cover
much of the country and **the [estimate in the caption holds that the
strike "would yield perhaps 50 million people killed]{.mark}"**

## Case

#### **MTCR is an informal non-binding agreement**

**United States Department of State 17**, G-7 17, 1-20-2017, \"Missile
Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Frequently Asked Questions,\" United
States Department of State,
https://www.state.gov/remarks-and-releases-bureau-of-international-security-and-nonproliferation/missile-technology-control-regime-mtcr-frequently-asked-questions/

What is the relationship between the MTCR and the UN? While there is no
formal linkage, the activities of the MTCR are consistent with the UN's
non-proliferation and export control efforts. For example, applying the
MTCR Guidelines and Annex on a national basis helps countries to meet
their export control obligations under UN Security Council Resolution
1540. 6. Is the MTCR a treaty? No. **[[The MTCR is not a treaty and does
not impose any legally binding obligations on Partners]{.mark}
(members). Rather, [it is an informal political
understanding]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}among states that seek to
limit the proliferation of missiles and missile technology.

#### The number of nations that are in MTCR make finding a consensus difficult, incentivizing countries to break the rules

**Beck 17, Michael.** (Executive Director, Center for International
Trade and Security**" Creating a New Multilateral Export Control
Regime". 2017,
mail.pircenter.org/media/content/files/10/13539385870.pdf.)**

**[[There are]{.mark} several [problems]{.mark} that are facing each of
the export control regimes]{.underline}** and their members efforts to
coordinate export controls: •**[[Growing number of
members]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This would seem to be a positive
development. However, member countries **[[do not always agree on the
nature of the threat]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Moreover, all of these
regimes take decisions on the basis of consensus. When there where 7
members of the MTCR, it was relatively easy to reach a consensus.
However, **[when there are]{.underline}** more than thirty members
**[consensus becomes difficult to obtain]{.underline}**. Simply put, the
growth of the regimes was not well thought out and needs to be
revisited. There are even organizational problems associated with
membership growth - finding space large enough to host a plenary of say
the NSG. •With growth in membership - **[[consensus decision making
needs to give way to new more democratic decision rules]{.mark}. For
years[, Russia stalled efforts within the Wassenaar to control
MANPA]{.mark}D[S]{.mark}. Russia is continuing to block efforts to
control small arms and light weapons within Wassenaar. It is not really
acceptable for one nation, whether it is the U.S., Russia, or Slovenia
or Poland to block the emergence of new international norms. •While
growth in membership is a problem - the lack of participation in
multilateral control efforts by major supplier and weapons states like
India, Pakistan, and China poses a serious problem. What obligations do
these countries have, if any, to control dual-use items? This inability
to guarantee responsible behavior on the part of countries not party to
these regimes, is in part, an explanation for the rise of a
counterproliferation regime as witnessed with the Proliferation Security
Initiative]{.underline}**. •Another problem stems from the inadequate
level of information sharing within the regimes. Although some regimes
have agreed to share information on denials, not all member countries
willingly share that information. The GAO in the United States reported
that the United States did not report any of 27 Australia Group-related
denials between 1996-2001. Some countries argue that they do not issue
denials, but instead inform exporters that they are unlikely to get a
license if they apply. These "de-facto" denials never enter the system.
Further efforts to share information on export approvals - which is
essential for determining technology transfer trends of concerns, or
violations of the no-undercut provisions embodied in the regimes have
not gone forward. •**[Finally, [some countries are very slow to
implement decisions reached within the regimes into national
legislation.]{.mark} Others don't implement decisions at all. Because
[decisions are implemented on the basis of national-discretion, there
are no real consequences for governments that fail to implement agreed
upon controls]{.mark}.]{.underline}** •In addition to internal
problems - there are external problems as well. The increased pace of
global trade. Controlling exports of emerging dual-use technologies
today requires foresight and the ability to juggle competing demands.
Officials must keep pace not only with technologies that pose a threat
today, but also with technological innovations that might be
militarily-relevant tomorrow. •Terrorism. Export Control authorities
must give more attention to transfers to failed states, and not just
rogue states. 911 originated in Afghanistan, not in Iraq or Iran. We
need to be concerned about failed states and gray zones, because these
are breeding grounds for terrorism, and such governments cannot be
trusted to control dangerous technology.

#### No MTCR follow on, Israel proves 

**Katz** **17** (Yaakov Katz, Yaakov Katz is an American-born Israeli
journalist and author who currently serves as the Editor-in-Chief of The

KAB )

In 1950, just two years after the state of Israel was founded, the
country's first commercial delegation set off for South America. Israel
desperately needed trading partners. Unlike its Arab adversaries, Israel
did not have natural resources to fund its economy. There was no oil or
minerals. Nothing. The delegation held a couple of meetings but was
mostly met with laughs. The Israelis were trying to sell oranges,
kerosene stove tops and fake teeth. For countries like Argentina, which
grew its own oranges and was connected to the electrical grid, the
products were pretty useless. It's hard to imagine this is what Israeli
exports looked like a mere 67 years ago. **[Today[, Israel is a
high-tech superpower and one of the world's top weapons exporters with
approximately \$6.5 billion in annual arms sales]{.mark}. Since 1985,
for example[, Israel is the world's largest exporter of drones,
responsible for about 60 percent of the global market]{.mark}, trailed
by the US, whose market share is under 25 percent. Its customers are
everywhere --- Russia, South Korea, Australia, France, Germany and
Brazil. In 2010,]{.underline}** for example, **[ﬁve NATO countries were
ﬂying Israeli drones in Afghanistan.]{.underline}** How did this happen?
How did Israel, a country not yet even 70 years old, become a superpower
with one of the most technologically advanced militaries in the world
that is changing the way modern wars are fought? The answer, I believe,
is a combination of a number of national characteristics unique to
Israel. First, despite Israel's small size, about 4.5 percent of its GDP
is spent on research and development, almost twice the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development average. Of that amount, about 30
percent goes to products of a military nature. By comparison, only 2
percent of German R&D and 17 percent of US R&D is for the military.
Another major contribution is the culture of innovation and creativity
in Israel. Israelis are more willing to take risks than other nations.
They get this from their compulsory military service during which they
are tasked, at a young age, to carry out missions often with deadly
consequences. While Israeli 19-year-olds embark on operations behind
enemy lines, their Western counterparts can be found in the safety of
their college dormitories.

#### The MTCR is fundamentally [useless]{.underline} for stopping missile prolif -- its own member states contribute to category 1 missile transfers 

**Knox 17** (T.J. Undergrad at UPenn \"The State Of The Missile
Technology Control Regime,\" Summer Program for Undergraduate Research
(SPUR). Available at <https://repository.upenn.edu/spur/22>) (CB)

**[Of the new missile powers, the predominant means of acquisition has
been missile transfers from the historical missile
states,]{.underline}** accounting for 53.1% of missile acquisition as
compared to domestic development, Indeed, **[with [10 of the 15 new
missile states only gaining]{.mark} ballistic missile [capabilities due
to transfers]{.mark} from the historical states alone, it is evident
that [the MTCR has been unable to]{.mark} entirely [prohibit]{.mark}
ballistic missile [transfers]{.mark} to new states. The trade in
ballistic missile technology continues. Moreover, [the arsenals]{.mark}
of these new missile powers [are largely composed of]{.mark} ballistic
[missiles which meet the MTCR]{.mark} Category I
classification]{.underline}**. **[This stands in contrast to the
Regime's strong presumption of denial on the export of these
weapons.]{.underline}** Particularly concerning is the subversion of the
export regime by its own Partners. As discussed, the United States and
Russia have continued to engage in the transfer of ballistic missiles
since 1987. **[While the MTCR does not prohibit its Partners from
engaging in missile transfers, the frequency in which the United States
and Russia have participated in the practice undermines the integrity of
the export regime as a voluntary, consensus-driven
arrangement]{.underline}**, **[and reinforces the reality that there are
no consequences for violating the export regime. It appears that the
domestic development of ballistic missile can be catalyzed by missile
transfers. In the case of Israel, Ukraine, and Libya,
independent]{.underline}** **[domestic development was undertaken after
the transfers of existing ballistic missiles]{.underline}**. **[With the
requisite expertise and technology in-hand, these states were able to
achieve the capability to develop more 12 sophisticated missiles with
little to no state assistance.]{.underline}** These states illustrate
how proliferation can be exponentiated through the simple transfer of a
short-range ballistic missile to another state, with the understanding
that these transfers can provide a platform for independent development.
Lastly, **[[the M]{.mark}issile [T]{.mark}echnology [C]{.mark}ontrol
[Regime has proven ineffective in curtailing prolif]{.mark}eration
[in]{.mark} [the Mid]{.mark}dle]{.underline}**
[**[East]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[The region has become increasingly
armed since 1987 through both domestic development and missile
transfers, and only Turkey, out of 14 new and historical missile powers
in the region, is party to the MTCR. This absence of MTCR adherence in
the Middle East is perhaps one of the greatest factors undermining the
effectiveness of the Regime both now and into the future, as the risk of
both missile transfers or deployment in warfare continues to rise as
proliferation continues]{.underline}**. Ultimately, **[the inadequacy of
the Missile Technology Control Regime over the past thirty years
demonstrates that it is time to strengthen the export
regime]{.underline}**. ● **[T[he subversion of the MTCR by its own
Partners is a systemic weakness]{.mark} to the export control regime. As
of now, there is little that can be done to enforce the Regime,
considering that it is a voluntary arrangement among cooperative states.
However, it would be useful to consider if it is time to move beyond a
voluntary export regime to a treaty-based instrument, with the power to
censure or sanction violators of the Regime]{.underline}**. ● The MTCR
places a strong presumption on the denial of Category I ballistic
missile technology. However, those Partners which choose to engage in
missile transfers may 13 inadvertently be catalyzing independent missile
development by recipients, as documented in the case of Libya, Ukraine,
and Israel. Partners should be diligent about this possibility in
determining if it should export Category I or even non-Category I
missiles to other states. ● The Middle East is a primary priority for
integration into the export regime in order to stymie further
proliferation in region. Working with Middle Eastern states to secure
export control pledges and opening dialogue to integrate the region's
missile powers into the Regime is a necessary step to revitalizing the
MTCR. **[While the Missile Technology Control Regime and its Partners
acknowledge the impossibility of preventing missile proliferation
entirely, it is evident that [the Regime has become outdated since its
inception three decades ago]{.mark}. In a geopolitical environment where
ballistic missiles are more relevant than ever to state conflict,
foreign relations, and national security strategy, antiproliferation
efforts must be founded upon a renewed Missile Technology Control
Regime.]{.underline}**

visual[, satellites are depicted as if they were hundreds of miles
wide]{.underline}, like the state of Pennsylvania (for the record, there
are no space objects the size of Pennsylvania in orbit). Unfortunately,
this is the rule, not the exception, [and almost all of these articles,
movies, graphics, and simulations are exaggerated and misleading. Space
debris and collision risk is real, but it certainly is not a
crisis.]{.underline} So what are the facts? On the positive side, [space
is empty and it is vast]{.underline}. [At the altitude of the
International Space Station, one half a degree of Earth longitude is
almost 40 miles long. That same one half a degree at geostationary
orbit, some 22,000 miles up is over 230 miles long]{.underline}.
Generally, [we don't intentionally put satellites closer together than
one-half degree]{.underline}. That means [at geostationary orbit, they
are no closer than 11 times as far as the eye can see on flat ground or
on the sea:]{.underline} That's the horizon over the horizon 10 times
over. In addition, [other than minute forces like solar winds and sparse
bits of atmosphere that still exist 500 miles up, nothing gets in the
way of orbiting objects and they behave quite predictably. [The location
of the smallest spacecraft can be predicated within a 1,000 feet, 24
hours in advance.]{.mark} Since we first started placing objects into
space there have been 11 known low Earth orbit collisions, and three
known collisions at geostationary orbit. Think of it: [135 space shuttle
flights, all of the Apollo, Gemini and Mercury flights, hundreds of
telecommunications satellites, 1,300 functioning satellites on orbit
today, half a million total objects in space larger than a marble, and
fewer than 15 known collisions. Why do people

First, **[[withholding military technology from close allies and
partners can strain security relationships]{.mark}. Since these
partnerships are grounded in trust, shared interests, and common
threats, partners may equate a state's unwillingness to export drones
with waning loyalty and commitment to other security
agreements.]{.underline}** For instance, **[the former top Italian Air

drones, [arguing](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2015/11/05/italy-wins-us-state-dept-ok-to-arm-its-reapers/) that

#### Japanese rearmament causes wars and an arms race---goes nuclear. Turn case 

**Mizokami 15** (Kyle Mizokami, defense and national security writer
based in San Francisco who has appeared in The Diplomat, Foreign Policy,
War is Boring and The Daily Beast. In 2009 he cofounded the defense and
security blog Japan Security Watch, "China's Ultimate Nightmare: Japan
Armed With Nuclear Weapons", 10/31/15,
[[https://nationalinterest.org/feature/china%E2%80%99s-ultimate-nightmare-japan-armed-nuclear-weapons-14214]{.underline}](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/china%E2%80%99s-ultimate-nightmare-japan-armed-nuclear-weapons-14214),
RKK)

[It is perhaps [China's greatest nightmare: a nuclear-armed
Japan]{.mark}.]{.underline} Permanently anchored off the Asian mainland,
bristling with nuclear weapons, [a nuclear Japan would make China's
security situation much more complex than it is now, and force China to
revise both its nuclear doctrine and increase its nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. To be perfectly clear, Japan has no intention of
building nuclear weapons. In fact, it has a strong aversion to nukes,
having been the only country to actually be on the receiving end of a
nuclear strike on its cities. Japan's strategic situation would have to
grow very dire for it to undertake such a drastic and expensive option.
At the same time, China has no interest in provoking Japan into building
them. China's nuclear "no first use" policy is in part aimed at
reassuring Japan that, unless it were attacked first with nuclear
weapons, it will not use them in wartime. Japan has no nukes, therefore,
if China holds to its word, Japan should be reassured. "If" and "should"
being the operative words here. Still, it's an interesting proposition.
Nuclear phobias and the lack of a pressing need aside, [[there's]{.mark}
certainly [no reason why Japan]{.mark},the third largest economy in the
world, [couldn't build nukes]{.mark}]{.underline}. What would a Japanese
nuclear deterrent look like? Let's examine the traditional nuclear triad
of land-based ballistic missiles, strategic bombers and ballistic
missile submarines and each leg of the triad's suitability for Japan's
circumstance. For the sake of argument, let's say Japan can choose just
one leg to invest in. We'll also set the number of nukes at roughly 300.
[Japan's high population density would mean that the destruction of just
a handful of cities could kill or injure the majority of the country's
civilian population. Against an adversary such as Russia or China, Japan
must be able to inflict similar losses[. Japan could invest in a small
arsenal of land-based missiles,]{.mark} each carrying one or more
nuclear warheads. The missiles could be stationed in hardened silos,
like the American Minuteman III, or on mobile launchers like the Russian
RS-24 Yars. [A Japanese ICBM would be smaller, not needing the range and
fuel to reach North America]{.mark}. The ability to reach all of China,
European Russia and the Middle East would be sufficient. Eventually,
Japan might settle on a force of 100 intermediate-range ballistic
missiles, each equipped with three 100 kiloton warheads.
T]{.underline}he missiles could be based in hardened silos in eastern
Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, or moved around on mobile
launchers. This is the least survivable of the three ideas. [Japan's
close proximity to China means that in the event of a nuclear attack
from the latter it would need to have a "launch on warning" doctrine to
ensure the missiles survived[. **That would considerably increase the
possibility of accidental nuclear war**]{.mark},]{.underline} as a
hardware or software malfunction in Japan's early warning system could
be incorrectly interpreted as an attack. Geography makes land basing
even less attractive. Japan's high population density makes it
impossible to find a location for 100 missile silos that would not would
invite terrible collateral damage in the event of attack. Even basing
them in remote places like the northern Island of Hokkaido would incur
needless risk. Mobile launchers would be far too large and heavy to
travel Japan's road network, unless a separate track were built
somewhere. Even that would make their positioning more predictable.
Another option might be to exploit Japan's extensive rail network.
[[Japan could build a wing of stealthy bombers to deliver cruise
missiles and nuclear gravity bombs]{.mark}. Such an aircraft could fly
nuclear penetration missions against adversaries, knocking out enemy
nuclear weapons, command and control and other counterforce
targets.]{.underline} Nuclear bombers would give Japanese strategic
warfare planners the flexibility to go after multiple targets or change
the targets in mid-flight. Nuclear bombers can be recalled at any point
in the mission. A bomber scheme could involve three squadrons of
twenty-four bombers each, for a total of seventy-two jets, each the size
of an FB-111 strike aircraft. Each bomber would carry four short-range
attack missiles, each with a 100 kiloton yield, for a total of 288
nuclear weapons. Geography also makes strategic bombers unlikely. A
lightning attack against Japan's bomber bases could wipe out the entire
force on the ground before they are given the order to scramble. If
tankers are necessary for the bombers to reach their targets, the
destruction of the Japanese tanker force would make the bombers
irrelevant. Furthermore, advances in air defense technology could make
the bombers dangerously vulnerable. Japan could, like the U.S. Air
Force's Strategic Air Command of old, maintain a force of bombers
permanently in the air, but that would be expensive and require enough
bombers in the air (and aerial tankers) at any one time inflict a
punishing blow. The cost and complexity of standing up and maintaining
such a force would be prohibitive. This is the most attractive option.
[Ballistic missile submarines are the most survivable platform---as long
as at least one were out on patrol at all times]{.underline}. Each
Japanese "boomer" could just sail east to the Mid-Pacific to relative
safety; any anti-submarine warfare ships and planes sent by Russia or
China to hunt it would have to get past Japan itself. Japan could
persuade the United States to share submarine, missile and warhead
technology with it the way it does with the United Kingdom. Of the three
basing schemes, the defensive nature of sea-based deterrent is probably
the most likely the United States would agree to help with. Depending on
the timeline, Japan could even end up funding certain parts of the Ohio
Replacement Program---particularly the missile. In a sea-basing scheme
Japan could emulate China, France or the United Kingdom, maintaining a
force of five ballistic missile submarines, each equipped with sixteen
nuclear-tipped missiles. [[Each missile would be equipped with four 100
kiloton warheads]{.underline}]{.mark}. The one submarine on patrol at
all times would be equipped with sixty-four warheads. There are some
drawbacks. Ballistic missile submarines would be more difficult to keep
in contact with during a crisis. Finally, if only two out of five
submarines are on patrol at any time only 128 warheads would be
available. Obviously, under current circumstances, it's not in anyone's
interests for Japan to have nuclear weapons. [Still, it must be
recognized that if pushed, it could certainly do so. Although a long
ways off, all sides should remember that increasingly strained relations
between Japan, China, and Russia could make a bad situation much, much
worse.]{.underline}

**[[The recent Iranian shootdown of an American RQ-4 Global Hawk
surveillance drone has underlined the escalating tension between U.S.
and Iran in the Persian Gulf]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[It also shows
how ubiquitous and necessary unmanned aerial vehicles have become for
America's military missions]{.underline}**. Yet **[the U.S. may cede the
future of these large UAVs to competitors such as China, Russia and,
ironically, Iran, if we don't change how we develop and deploy these
systems.]{.underline}**

**[The media has trained Americans to think of military drones primarily
as tools for finding and killing terrorists]{.underline}**. In fact,
**[they handle a much broader range of missions, from gathering
intelligence and watching hot spots like the Strait of Hormuz to
monitoring weather patterns and disaster relief. These so-called
autonomous systems are quiet and relatively inconspicuous and can stay
aloft for 20 to 30 hours at a time. Given their growing
importance]{.underline}** **[for keeping the armed forces and
intelligence services informed 24/7]{.underline}**---and since similar
systems will soon become part of the U.S. commercial aircraft
fleet---almost every expert agrees they are the future of the aerospace
industry.

Yet **[thanks to]{.underline}** a single outdated provision of an
obscure international agreement formed in 1987---the Missile Technology
Control Regime, or **[MTCR]{.underline}**---**[the [U.S. may lose
leadership to China and Iran of the large-drone
market]{.mark},]{.underline}** **[which is expected to grow to \$32
billion in 10 years]{.underline}**. **[The problem is that the treaty
includes drones in the category of missile technology capable of
carrying a 500-kilogram payload at least 300 kilometers. [MTCR
signatories like the U.S. are forbidden to export drones with that
capacity, even to trusted allies.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[That restriction dates to 1992, when unmanned aircraft were
essentially target drones. The fear was that they'd be used for
kamikaze-style terrorist attacks]{.underline}**. That worry proved
unfounded. **[[What it means today is that U.S. allies like South Korea
and Britain can't buy Global Hawks or Predators except through special
executive waiver, a time-consuming bureaucratic
process]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[This means that good actors are denied the vast progress UAV
technology has made in]{.underline}** **[the U.S. since 1992, advances
that have made large drones faster, safer and more
versatile.]{.underline}**

**[China has stepped into the vacuum. Beijing isn't an MTCR signatory
and so is free to sell large drones
world-wide]{.underline}**---including to Egypt and the United Arab
Emirates after the U.S. had to turn down their requests for American
drones, thanks to the MTCR. **[The Chinese drones are based on
technology stolen from American companies, naturally.]{.underline}**

A January report from the Defense Intelligence Agency pointed out that
China has become a niche supplier of armed drones to putative American
allies, and noted that because of the MTCR, "China faces little
competition for sale of such systems."

**[[Iran, also not an MTCR signatory, similarly sees an economic and
strategic opportunity in the large-drone market.]{.mark} It has been
building unmanned systems suitable for export---also based on stolen
U.S. technology---according to the Times of Israel.]{.underline}**

**[Export sales are essential to a robust made-in-America drone
industry, which will need to include commercial-aircraft as well as
defense systems. American companies and workers won't be the only losers
if the rules don't change. Human-rights critics often worry that the
U.S. military's reliance on drones will lead to a Big Brother-like
surveillance state that uses this technology for inhuman and tyrannical
ends. [Leaving the drone market to China and Iran makes that outcome
more likely.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### drones are stabilizing in nature

**Horowitz, Kreps, Fuhrmann**, 1-25-**2016** (Michael C., Sarah E.,
Matthew, professor of political science at the University of
Pennsylvania, American political scientist who has written extensively
on drones and drone warfare, and professor of political science at the
University of Pennsylvania respectively, "The Consequences of Drone
Proliferation: Separating Fact from Fiction") (CB)

B**[eyond the use of drones in ongoing military conflicts is the
question of how UAV deployments may influence stability in contested
regions of the world]{.underline}**. Precisely **[because soldiers'
lives are not directly at risk, pessimists about drone proliferation
fear that states might take crossborder actions with fewer
reservations]{.underline}**, **[which could be particularly
destabilizing in areas where countries are already prone to
mistrust,]{.underline}** such as the East and South China Seas. Michael
Boyle argues, for instance, "The risks of a conflict spiral arising from
the shoot-down of the drone or an accident of some kind in the East
China Sea are real and potentially dangerous."93 Despite the technical
limitations of armed drones, it is nonetheless possible that a state
might attempt to carry out drone strikes on an adversary's territory,
potentially triggering a crisis if the UAV is shot down. **[It is more
likely, however, that countries would use drones for persistent
surveillance in a contested area.]{.underline}** Indeed, this is a case
where unarmed drones could carry significant, possibly salutary
implications for international security. **[Most international disputes
arise from border disputes,94 where the primary risk of escalation on a
regular basis comes from miscommunication and
misinterpretation]{.underline}**, **[rather than a deliberate decision
to change the status quo.]{.underline}** In the maritime arena alone,
there are more than 430 bilateral boundaries that are not governed by
formal agreements. **[States concerned with upholding their claims in
these boundary areas might be especially drawn to using drones for
persistent surveillance 24 due to the technology's superior endurance,
and because states could literally "test the waters" with less risk than
would be incurred with a manned equivalent]{.underline}**.95 Moreover,
the ability to substitute robots for people might make countries more
likely to deploy drones into contested regions and behave more
assertively, because the costs of losing them seem lower.96 If
deployments move from close-to-the-border to inside an adversary's
territory, there is some risk of triggering an armed confrontation. The
deployment of drones could increase the risk of accidents and unintended
clashes in this context. **[When one state deploys UAVs, the other side
may not clearly understand whether the drones are intended for offensive
or defensive purposes.97 This uncertainty may cause a state to adopt
worst-case thinking, potentially leading to a forceful
response.]{.underline}** **[The likelihood of using force increases
insofar as a pilot or captain knows that his or her actions would not
result in another individual being killed.]{.underline}** **[China, for
example, is reported to have a policy of shooting down unannounced
drones with surface-to-air missiles or fighter aircraft.98 Compounding
matters further, the rules of engagement for responding to drone
incursions -- whether and when to shoot down a drone that transgresses
borders -- are currently ambiguous. This could create a vacuum in terms
of mutual understandings and lead to escalation]{.underline}**.
**[Consider]{.underline}**, for example, **[the numerous incidents that
have spilled into the public sphere concerning the United States
military and the Chinese military over the last few decades, including
the EP-3 incident in 2001, the confrontation between a Chinese naval
frigate and the USNS Impeccable in 2013, and the reported near miss
between a US surveillance plane and a Chinese fighter jet in
2014]{.underline}**.99 The spate of Russian air incursions into NATO
airspace in the Baltic Sea region likewise underscore the potential for
diplomatic incidents resulting from military deployments. During 2014,
Russia conducted over 400 patrols in the region, corresponding with
deteriorating **[With long-range drones added to the mix, the number of
incursions into NATO airspace could significantly escalate as the costs
of incursion decrease for Russia]{.underline}**. The potentially
destabilizing consequences could be more intense because of the unclear
rules of engagement that attend the use of armed drones.101 **[The above
arguments certainly have some merit. However, it is important not to
overstate the risk of drone deployments for regional or international
stability. None of the aforementioned incidents actually led to armed
military engagement]{.underline}**. On the contrary, **[emerging norms
on the consequences of shooting down a drone, though clearly still in
the early stages, suggest that states distinguish between when manned
and unmanned systems are shot down]{.underline}**. **[Thus, even if
accidents happen in these types of situations]{.underline}**, **[they
are less likely to trigger crises or escalation than the pessimistic
view implies]{.underline}**. For example, when Pakistan shot down an
Indian surveillance drone in the Kashmir region in summer 2015 that it
said strayed beyond the line of control, India did not escalate the
long-simmering conflict to war.102 Similarly, compare the muted
international discussion when Turkey shot down a drone flying on its
border with Syria in fall 2015 with the diplomatic crisis between Turkey
and Russia that erupted when Turkey shot down a manned SU-24.103
Countries appear to know that opponents will value drones differently
than manned aircraft, and behave accordingly, meaning that drones
carrying out surveillance and reconnaissance missions need not be
destabilizing, as long as all actors hold the same views about shooting
down drones. This may not always be the case since, as noted previously,
the rules of engagement in this context are not clearly defined.
**[There are reasons to think that using drones for surveillance could
actually be stabilizin]{.underline}**g. **[Drones could give both sides
in a dispute real-time information about the situation at lower cost,
and with lower risk to personnel, than is possible at
present]{.underline}**. **[This is especially true since countries can
use drones deployed near or at their borders to "see" into contested
areas or even their 26 adversaries' territory more persistently with
drones. This could reduce the risk of conflict, for two reasons. First,
the state deploying a drone to a contested area for surveillance
purposes will have more information. Assuming that its enemy is not
planning to launch an attack, this information could reduce fears of
aggression]{.underline}**, **[potentially reducing the risk of
destabilizing countermeasures. Second, the existence of surveillance
drones could decrease the ability of potential aggressors to conduct
surprise attacks or covert activities.]{.underline}** With surveillance
drones operating near the border, an adversary may observe military
deployments, allowing it to take appropriate preparations. **[Drones,
then, may be useful for deterrence by denial:]{.underline}**104 if the
potential aggressor believed that the element of surprise was critical
to operational success, and that drones flying near the border would
give the other state adequate notice, they may be less likely to launch
an attack. Both of these mechanisms could reinforce stability, even when
their relative impact is small.

#### Hypersonic Missile spending are key to holding the line against China and maintaining US heg

David **Brennan**, **7-5**-2019, \"China\'s hypersonic missiles: How
worried should the U.S. be about futuristic weapons?,\" Newsweek, \<span
class=\"skimlinks-unlinked\"\>https://www.newsweek.com/china-hypersonic-missile-weapons-worried-u-s-arms-race-military-pentagon-1447681\</span\>

A **[recent propaganda]{.underline}** video **[released by the Chinese
military has brought one of the country\'s most advanced
a]{.underline}**nd threatening **[technologies]{.underline}** **[back to
the fore---hypersonic weaponry.]{.underline}**

**[[Hypersonic
weapons](https://www.newsweek.com/what-are-hypersonic-weapons-and-why-darpa-so-concerned-about-stopping-them-1212892) travel
at incredible speed and---unlike even the most advanced ballistic
missiles---can maneuver in flight]{.underline}**. This gives the weapons
enormous range and makes them much harder to track and stop.

**[The U.S., Russia and China are all investing heavily in hypersonic
technologies]{.underline}**. However, **[the Pentagon has been the
slowest to jump on the bandwagon and military chiefs are warning that
the [U.S. could be left
behind](https://www.newsweek.com/us-no-longer-safe-advanced-russian-and-chinese-weapons-general-warns-1095536)]{.underline}** by
its authoritarian adversaries, at least when it comes to nuclear-capable
hypersonics.

The U.S. still maintains by far the most powerful military on Earth,
supported by a military budget larger than that of the next seven
biggest spending nations combined. As such, America\'s rivals must
consider intelligent methods of leveling the playing field and---at
least on a local or regional level---**[upending long-held U.S. military
hegemony]{.underline}**.

This is especially true for China, where the government has invested
huge sums in bringing its outdated military up to scratch. Beijing is
rapidly transitioning to a potent modern force, but one still inferior
to the U.S.

Nonetheless, **[military spending has been [geared towards exploiting
U.S.
weaknesses](https://www.newsweek.com/china-military-technology-parity-us-report-research-investment-pentagon-1442565) and
dominating East Asia]{.underline}**. Beijing is hoping that its
hypersonic weapons will form a key element in this [disruptive
strategy](https://www.newsweek.com/here-are-future-weapons-will-threaten-america-1262925).

**[There are two types of hypersonic weapon---cruise missiles (HCMs) and
glide vehicles (HGVs). Both are able to travel at speeds of Mach 1 or
higher]{.underline}**---**[around 3,800 miles per hour---and can
maneuver during flight]{.underline}**. This makes them difficult to
shoot down, but also means it is very difficult to predict what target
they will hit.

**[HGVs are launched by a ballistic missile, but the hypersonic
component itself does not have an engine. HCMs can be launched by other
vehicles such as fighter jets or naval vessels, and power themselves
with internal engines]{.underline}**. Both weapons can be armed with
either nuclear or conventional warheads.

**[China is working on both types of weapon]{.underline}**. According to
Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, Beijing is within \"a few
years\" of fielding an HGV.

China already fields a daunting missile arsenal, whether subsonic,
supersonic or ballistic. For enemies, this already challenging scenario
is exacerbated by the introduction of HGVs.

As Barrie told Newsweek, HGVs \"fly at an altitude not presently well
covered by radar systems, and given their speed also potentially cut
down reaction and decision time on the part of the defender. Were
\[China\] to go ahead and also field hypersonic cruise missiles then
this defensive picture would become only more complex.\"

\"Any system that reduces reaction and decision time is potentially
further destabilising,\" Barrie added. China\'s interest in HGVs in part
would seem to be driven by the desire to counter missile defence systems
that are already or could be deployed in the Indo-Pacific theatre.\"

**[Hypersonic weapons will form a key element of Chinese military
strategy. U.S. force projection depends on regional bases and aircraft
carriers]{.underline}**. As James Bosbotinis---the co-CEO of U.K.-based
JB Associates and an expert in maritime and aerial security---explained,
it is **[these \"high-value\" targets that hypersonic weapons will focus
on, particularly where evading anti-missile defenses is
required.]{.underline}**

\"**[Leadership facilities, key command and control centers, underground
facilities, air bases, time-critical targets such as mobile missile
launchers]{.underline}**\" and maritime targets will all be on the list,
Bosbotinis told Newsweek.

Once deployed, **[the weapons will \"significantly enhance\" Chinese
strike capabilities in East]{.underline}** **[Asia]{.underline}**,
Bosbotinis continued. The DF-17 HGV (known by the Pentagon as WU-17),
for example, has a reported range of between 1,118 and 1,553 miles. This
system is expected to be operational by 2020, at which point it will be
the world\'s first HGV put into service.

Such [[peer]{.mark} [pressure]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [be]{.mark} very
[effective]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It [has even been suggested
that the pressure exerted behind the scenes to compel others to adopt
sanctions may be more influential than the sanctions
themselves.]{.underline} Peer pressure can promote compliance with a
non- binding document. [For example, at least thirty nations have
voluntarily agreed to a common export control policy of missile delivery
technology called the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). The
MTCR]{.underline} is neither an international treaty nor a legally
binding agreement. The MTCR [does not mandate sanctions]{.underline}.
Yet, the regime has succeeded in preventing Iraq from obtaining a modern
ballistic missile which has a far more devastating impact than the SCUD
missile used in the 1990 Gulf War. The MTCR is also credited with
curtailing Argentinean and Brazilian missile projects, delaying China\'s
sales of missiles to Pakistan, and encouraging Germany to improve its
export control legislation. [A high degree of [peer]{.mark}
[pressure]{.mark} [dominates]{.mark} the voluntary agreement. Indeed,

[can]{.mark} [force]{.mark} at least an attempt at [cooperation]{.mark}
among parties with disparate motivations and viewpoints.]{.underline}
**[If these informal methods are successful they can create \"epistemic
communities\" of individuals committed to solving the problem of space
debris]{.underline}**. [An epistemic community is a network of knowledge
based experts or professionals who regularly share information on a
given topic]{.underline}. **[More than a mere collection of individuals,
such a transnational group often has a shared technical orientation,
similar principles, and a complimentary value
orientation.]{.underline}** Although government officials may not always
yield to requests made by an epistemic community, **[[the]{.mark}
intricate technical problems of space debris regulation make at least
some reliance upon experts inevitable]{.underline}**. [Epistemic
community members may have ties to government, comprehend a state\'s
self-interests and factions, and apply influence to key bureaucratic
\"pressure points\" in order to gain political leverage.]{.underline}
Eventually, [epistemic community members may infiltrate governments and
promote adoption of policy initiatives proposed by the
community]{.underline}. [Although a seemingly innocuous collection of
scientists may seem impotent to develop space policy, the power of
epistemic communities cannot be underestimated. As Peter Haas writes: A
transnational community\'s ideas may take root in an international
organization or in various state bodies, after which they are diffused
to other states via the decision makers who have been influenced by the
ideas. As a result, the community can have a systemic impact. Because of
its larger diffusion network, a transnational community\'s influence is
likely to be much more sustained and intense than that of a national
community. These informal [methods of pressure, reward, and community
mobilization]{.mark} are [useful]{.mark} preliminary tools [for]{.mark}
[developing]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [productive]{.mark} [space debris working
group]{.mark}. Direct contacts between scientists studying the space
debris problem may forge relationships quicker than political
communications between member states. Similar training and scientific
values ease tensions and create common ground between group
participants. Although political influence cannot be fully erased, and
it would not be beneficial to do so, [scientific contacts and
mobilization can promote cooperation]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the early
[stages of developing a space debris regime without national
influence]{.mark} or self-interest. [Formation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a
productive, committed, and professional working group, unified toward a

### China exports !

#### Chinese leadership in the context of drone exports leads to drone fueled terror attacks -- the MTCR is what is holding the US back from competition in the field

**Reimann**, **2-18**-2019 (Jakob, writer for Foreign Policy In Focus,
with works dedicated to the Middle East, \"China is Flooding the Middle
East With Cheap Drones,\" Foreign Policy In Focus,
<https://fpif.org/china-is-flooding-the-middle-east-with-cheap-drones/>)
(CB)

The last great revolution on the world's battlefields began with the
advent of the drone era.

Particularly **[in the Middle East, the drone became the symbol of the
U.S. empire operating in a legal vacuum.]{.underline}** **[In the first
decade and a half of the "War on Terror," the U.S. still had a virtual
monopoly on the risk-free execution from thousands of meters above ---
but once the genie is out of the bottle, every attempt to squeeze it
back in is notoriously doomed to failure.]{.underline}**

And so, quickly **[other countries in the region aspired after the
financially --- and politically --- cheap execution by
drone]{.underline}**. **[The number of armies with their own drone fleet
is growing rapidly]{.underline}**. **[[A multi-billion-dollar
market](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2017/05/03/global-drone-market-expected-to-surpass-22b-by-2022/) with
astronomical growth rates opened up --- demand that's essentially served
only by one actor: China.]{.underline}**

The U.S. has squandered its lead

T**[he appearance of the Rainbow CH-4 --- the driving force of Chinese
combat drones --- is]{.underline}** **[[almost
identical](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a22101/chinas-ch-4b-drone-looks-awfully-familiar/) to
the notorious Reaper drone of the U.S. arms manufacturer General
Atomics]{.underline}**. While the CH-4 [lags
behind](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/) the
Reaper in most performance parameters, it can keep up with or even
outperform its competitor in some of them. Also, **[the CH-4's
weaponry, [the AKD-10
warhead](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/),
is almost identical to the Reaper's Hellfire missiles.]{.underline}**

**[The striking similarity follows a strategy of Chinese engineering
well-known from cell phones or cars: the look of a world-famous Western
branded product is copied with an inferior but sufficiently good quality
compared to that of the original]{.underline}** --- but at significantly
less cost. **[Chinese drones are 50 to 75 percent cheaper than the
originals from the U.S.]{.underline}**

A late 2015 article published in the Asia Times suggests that **[this
copying of U.S. technology is likely rooted in Beijing's data
theft]{.underline}**. **[According to records by world-famous NSA
whistleblower Edward Snowden, by 2010 alone "Chinese hackers had
conducted [more than 30,000 cyber
attacks](http://www.atimes.com/chinas-armed-drones-appear-built-from-stolen-data-from-us-cyber-intrusions/)"
on Pentagon computer networks and other U.S. military agencies in order
to "exfiltrate \[data on\] sensitive military
technology]{.underline}**." Although there is no final proof that data
on drones were skimmed off too, Asia Times quotes then **[NSA director
Gen. Keith Alexander, who suggests that it is highly likely that the
Reaper blueprints were part of the Chinese data hack, while military
experts and analysts largely share this view.]{.underline}**

**[With the latest model --- the CH-7, which is still in the development
phase --- China could possibly pull ahead the U.S. for the first time,
military journal [Defense
One explains](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/11/chinas-beating-us-market-combat-drones-copying-us-technology/152625/).
The CH-7 "will be the sole option for buyers wanting to field stealth
combat drones]{.underline}**," it predicts. "The United States had a
decade-plus head start on \[drone\] technology," says military expert
Paul Scharre, "and has unfortunately squandered that lead."

China captures the market

**[For a long time, it was only the United States, the United Kingdom,
and Israel that had combat drones and used them to execute alleged
terrorists --- something that has changed dramatically in recent
years.]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, **[the number of countries with combat drones has swelled
to [at least
29](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/world-of-drones/3-who-has-what-countries-armed-drones/)]{.underline}**,
as research organization New America identifies. And
**[10[ countries](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/world-of-drones/2-who-has-what-countries-drones-used-combat/) have
demonstrably used them to kill suspected enemies]{.underline}**; **[in
addition to the three mentioned, there is Iran, Azerbaijan, the UAE, as
well as Nigeria, Iraq, Pakistan, and Turke]{.underline}**y (the last
four countries drone-killed people on their own soil).

**[Historically]{.underline}**, **[Israel is the largest drone
exporter,]{.underline}** with a [market share of over 60
percent](https://drones.rusi.org/countries/israel/) in the last three
decades. **[More recently, from 2008-2017, China exported a total of [88
drones to at least 12
countries](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/),
ranking third among the world's drone exporters behind the United
States]{.underline}** (351) **[and Israel]{.underline}** (186).

However, **[while the vast majority of U.S. and Israeli exports are made
up of unarmed reconnaissance drones, China's sales focus on armed
drones. During the mentioned period, China exported 68 combat drones,
putting it ahead of the U.S. (62) and Israel
(56]{.underline}**). **[Foreign Policy thus recently titled rightly:
"[China Has Already Won the Drone
Wars](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/10/china-trump-middle-east-drone-wars/)."]{.underline}**

All of the armed forces of the Chinese military have [large fleets of
various
drones](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2161354/drones-have-become-part-chinas-military-strategy),
but Beijing has used them so far only for disaster relief, surveillance
of domestic critics, and military reconnaissance --- not to kill. (In
2013, Beijing considered executing by drone a [Myanmar drug
baron](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/world/asia/chinese-plan-to-use-drone-highlights-military-advances.html) wanted
in the murders of 13 Chinese sailors, but eventually caught and tried
him.)

Rather, **[Beijing appears to be establishing a norm permanently
prohibiting lethal drone strikes in East and South Asia]{.underline}**.
However, **[this no-shoot dogma does not prevent the Chinese arms
industry from exporting their drones to states that are patently using
them for killing elsewhere.]{.underline}**

How China services U.S. clients

**[While the Pentagon continues to this day to deliver armed Reaper
drones only to the UK, France, and Italy, purchasers of Chinese combat
drones, [according to Chinese
manufacturers](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/10/china-trump-middle-east-drone-wars/),
include Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Myanmar, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, the UAE, and
Zambia]{.underline}**. So far, [t**[he three largest
buyers]{.underline}** of Chinese
drones](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/) **[are
Pakistan]{.underline}** (with a share of 25 percent) as well as Egypt
and Myanmar (with 23 and 13 percent, respectively). **[Several of
Beijing's buyers are close strategic U.S. allies who have requested the
sale of armed drones from Washington to no avail and have thus fallen
back on Chinese products.]{.underline}**

The U.S. is by far the largest arms exporter and usually sells military
equipment to almost every country in the world. [According to the SIPRI
research
institute](http://justicenow.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SIPRI_Arms-Export-USA_2007-2017.xlsx),
the U.S. sold \$98 billion worth of weapons to as many as 112 countries
in 2007-2017. Hence, on the face of it, it seems rather counterintuitive
that it would hand over the lucrative battle drone market to China.

[A recent report by the
DIA](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/pentagon-mideast-turning-china-drone-needs.html),
the Pentagon's internal intelligence service, deals with this
contradiction. "**[China is a niche provider of armed \[drones\]" in the
Middle East, the report acknowledges, and correctly concludes that
"China faces little competition]{.underline}**" as it is not a member of
international export control regimes. In fact, **[unlike the U.S. and
the European arms-exporting countries, China is not a contracting party
to the [Missile Technology Control
Regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Technology_Control_Regime#Members) (MTRC),
which strictly regulates the proliferation of combat drones and makes
U.S. drone exports to the Middle East more difficult.]{.underline}**

**[In addition to attempts by the Trump administration to amend the
MTRC, Trump's State Department published a [new export
policy](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280619.htm) in April
2018: "We will remove barriers to the global \[drone\] market and avoid
ceding export opportunities to competitors where such self-imposed
restrictions are unwarranted."]{.underline}**

**[Since the wording does not specify when restrictions are
"unwarranted," the new policy can be understood as blank approval for
future drone exports. De facto, it was also made possible to buy combat
drones directly from the manufacturer, [without the government as a
broker
agent](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/06/trump-push-to-boost-lethal-drone-exports-reaps-few-rewards-uas-mtcr/).
"To date, however, that hasn't led to any reported sales to the Middle
East," Forbes [reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/12/17/china-fueling-drones-arms-race-middle-east/) late
last year.]{.underline}**

So, in contrast to relatively strict regulations on U.S. drone exports,
China's "[no questions
asked](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/12/17/china-fueling-drones-arms-race-middle-east/)"
policy allowed it to quickly gain a foothold in the lucrative Middle
East drone market and aggressively expand the course of the
proliferation of cheap drones.

**[State-of-the-art technology perceived as revolutionary always comes
with a certain adulation for its possessor.]{.underline}** Thus, a
recent report by London-based military think tank RUSI concludes that
"[national prestige and
status](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/drones-1687746893) is the
main reason that most states" in the Middle East increasingly acquire
drones, as Middle East Eye reports. However, in addition to their value
as status symbols, in recent years they are more and more being used
strategically [on the battlefields of the
region](https://www.voanews.com/a/report-china-driving-use-of-armed-drones-in-middle-east/4704022.html),
which the RUSI report attributes largely to increased Chinese exports.

And so **[Chinese drones also recorded their first deaths: Besides fatal
deployment by the [Nigerian
army](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/10/03/chinese-armed-drones-now-flying-over-mideast-battlefields-heres-why-theyre-gaining-on-us-drones/)against
Boko Haram, since the end of 2015, the Iraqi military performed more
than [260 air
strikes](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/chinas-drones-are-taking-isis-heres-why-america-should-worry-24581)against
Islamic State targets with Chinese drones.]{.underline}** **[They gained
particular infamy on April 22 last year, when the UAE [executed the de
facto president of
Yemen](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/),
Saleh Ali al-Sammad, with a Chinese drone, escalating the nearly
four-year war in the country. The murdered Al-Sammad was seen as a
promoter of the UN-mediated peace process in Yemen, whereas his
successor, Mahdi al-Mashat, is an implacable, uncompromising hardliner
and provocateur.]{.underline}**

**[Pandora's box is open]{.underline}**

**[Of particular concern is China's drone policy in Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline}**

**[A \$ 65 billion economic program clinched between the two countries
in spring 2017 includes the construction of a [Chinese drone factory in
Saudi
Arabia](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2081869/chinese-drone-factory-saudi-arabia-first-middle-east) ---
the first of its kind in the region. Initially, the license production
of [300
drones](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/drones-1687746893) was
agreed]{.underline}**, which represents a massive figure given the 88
drones that China has exported in the last decade altogether.

However, **[the license drones are not exclusively intended for the
Saudi Royal Air Force --- Riyadh can explicitly [market them to other
countries](https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/29253) in the region.
End-user certificates do not exist for deals with Beijing. In view of
the fact that Saudi Arabia, along with supporting various jihadist
groups in the region, is [a close ally of Al Qaeda in
Yemen](http://justicenow.de/2018-03-18/des-westen-als-treuer-verbuendeter-der-al-qaida/)]{.underline}**,
**[it is within the realm of possibility to envision some of these
drones end up in terrorist's hands. Fueled]{.underline}** **[by
Beijing's export policy, the threat scenario of drone-armed jihadists
has moved significantly closer.]{.underline}**

Research by the Jamestown Foundation shows that we have already entered
the era of "[unmanned
terrorism](https://jamestown.org/program/entering-era-unmanned-terrorism/)."
**[Groups commonly labelled as "terrorists" from Syria, Iraq, and
Afghanistan to Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen are already using mini-drones to
drop bombs, grenades, and incendiary devices onto enemy positions or
civilian facilities.]{.underline}** **[Further flooding the region with
cheap combat drones from China will certainly heave these tactics to the
next level in the future.]{.underline}**

Since 2001, **[thousands of people, most of them civilians, have been
killed by drone in the so-called "War on Terror,]{.underline}**"
**[changing the nature of war in its entirety and exposing civilians in
all these undeclared war zones to a permanent threat on their
lives]{.underline}**. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Barack Obama proved he
could always escape punishment and international condemnation even after
using drones to [turn weddings and funerals into blood baths and mass
graves](https://roarmag.org/essays/obama-legacy-war-conflict-peace/).
And so, the desires of local actors to acquire these practical killing
tools were aroused, too.

**[The Chinese leadership is exploiting these developments without
compromise and flooding the Middle East with cheap drones. The
consequences of this expansionary policy cannot be
foreseen.]{.underline}**

Pandora's box is already open.

#### The MTCR is allowing China to sell arms to nations the US cannot -- that is causing harmful prolif and leads to middle eastern arms races

**Iddon**, **7-4**-2019 (Paul, a freelance journalist based in Erbil,
Iraqi Kurdistan who writes about Middle East affairs, \"How China is
heavily contributing to Middle East drone and missile proliferation,\"
alaraby,
<https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2019/7/4/china-is-heavily-contributing-to-middle-east-drone-proliferation>)
(CB)

**[The People\'s Republic of China has contributed significantly to the
proliferation of both ballistic missiles and armed drones in the Middle
East and shows no sign of reversing course in the foreseeable
future.]{.underline}**

**[While the United States and its European allies have long sold their
Middle East clients billions worth of arms]{.underline}**, even when
those clients committed war crimes, **[they have routinely restricted
the sale of both ballistic missiles and armed drones.]{.underline}**

**[This is due to fears that such lethal weapons could fall into the
wrong hands and because the US, most of Europe and Russia are all
signatories of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), which seeks
to prevent the proliferation of such weapon]{.underline}**s.
**[China]{.underline}**, on the other hand, **[is not a signatory of the
MTCR.]{.underline}**

**[Citing US intelligence sources]{.underline}**, a
recent [CNN exclusive](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/us-intelligence-saudi-arabia-ballistic-missile-china/index.html) confirmed
that **[Saudi Arabia has been \"significantly escalating\" its ballistic
missile programme with China\'s help.]{.underline}**

This had previously been suspected in January, when satellite
images [revealed](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2019/2/20/saudi-long-range-missile-factory-sparks-fears-over-weapons-proliferation) that
the Saudis now possess what appears to be a ballistic missile factory
and testing stand apparently based on a Chinese design.\
\
**[The Saudis stockpile of ballistic missiles originates from China. In
the late 1980s, the kingdom procured long-range nuclear-capable DF-3A
ballistic missiles, which were first introduced in 1971. They were
displayed to the public for the first time ever in a military parade
back in April 2014]{.underline}**.

In 2007, the Saudis
also [acquired](https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-cia-helped-saudis-chinese-missile-deal-227283) more
accurate DF-21 ballistic missiles from China. The US approved the deal
on the condition that the CIA was first allowed to inspect the missiles
and verify they were not nuclear-capable.

  --

  --

Today, **[Beijing is providing Riyadh with unspecified assistance to
expand the Saudi \"missile infrastructure and
technology]{.underline}**\" according to CNN. This revelation, coupled
with the aforementioned disclosure of the missile facility earlier this
year, indicates that China is giving the Saudis the know-how and
infrastructure to build their own missiles.

Over time, **[that could enable the Saudis to engage in a ballistic
missile arms race with their Iranian adversaries on the other side of
the Gulf.]{.underline}**

**[This wouldn\'t be surprising nor all that unprecedented since China
previously has helped Turkey develop its own ballistic missile
arsenal]{.underline}**. This began in the late 1990s when Ankara made a
deal that allowed it to produce licensed Chinese B-611 missiles. 

Out of this Turkey manufactured the J-600T Yıldırım tactical ballistic
missile with Chinese technology. These missiles were first shown to the
Turkish public in 2007. There are at least [two variants of that
missile](https://www.dailysabah.com/defense/2017/11/08/turkey-expanding-missile-defense-capabilities-by-inking-deal-with-eurosam-1510130325),
the first with a range of 150km and the second with a range of 300km.

In 2017, **[the Bora-1 ballistic missile entered service. It was made by
the Turkish arms manufacturer and contractor Roketsan and is reportedly
built with domestically-made components]{.underline}**, although the
guidance system is American-made. According to Roketsan the Bora-1 can
hit targets from up to 280km away and is accurate to within 50 metres.
It carries a 470kg warhead.

**[Turkey is also a signatory of the MTCR, which [seeks to
ban](https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/turkey/j-600.htm) countries
from importing or exporting missiles with warheads heavier than 500kg
and ranges exceeding 300km.]{.underline}** This means that the Bora-1,
which Turkey also intends to export, and the J-600T are in compliance
with these limitations.

Turkey\'s Bora-2 project, on the other hand, [has raised
eyebrows](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2018/05/02/turkey-seeks-to-expand-range-of-locally-built-missile/) since
Ankara says it seeks to expand the range of the Bora-1. It would make
little sense for Turkey to invest in building a new missile with an
extended range of a mere 20km and a warhead only 30kg heavier than the
Bora-1\'s.

This suggests future Turkish missiles may exceed the limitations set by
the MTCR.

  --

  --

Unconfirmed Turkish press reports claimed the Bora-1 has already been
used against Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK) targets in a cross border
strike into Iraqi Kurdistan in late May.

If true this would be the first time Turkey used such a missile in
combat as well as [another worrying
indication](http://www.rudaw.net/english/analysis/01062019)that Middle
East states are more readily using such weapons in the region\'s
conflicts. \
\
Iran, for example, also preemptively targeted and destroyed a Kurdish
opposition group\'s headquarters deep inside Iraqi Kurdistan using its
own Fateh-110 ballistic missiles last September.

While the Bora-1 is likely a more improved version of the J-600T with
much more locally-developed components its existence is doubtlessly
thanks to Beijing\'s initial willingness to help Ankara get a ballistic
missile programme off the ground in the first place.  

China also secretly sold Qatar short-range SY-400 ballistic missiles,
which were [publicly
revealed](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/china-secretly-sold-qatar-short-range-ballistic-missiles-23770) in
the country\'s December 2017 National Day military parade.

**[In recent years, Beijing has supplied armed drones to several
countries in the Middle East, contributing greatly to the proliferation
of these weapons in the troubled region in clear contravention of the
MTCR\'s noble objectives.]{.underline}**

**[China\'s Wing Loong II drones are essentially complete replicas of
the American Predator drone and fire the Chinese equivalent to the
American Hellfire air-to-ground missile.]{.underline}** China have sold
them to states across the Middle East which has directly contributed to
the proliferation of these unmanned weapons.

  --

  --

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has notably used Wing Loongs in the
controversial Saudi-led air campaign against the Houthis in Yemen, which
has contributed greatly to that country\'s destruction and misery since
it began in early 2015.

**[In April 2018, the UAE killed Saleh al-Samad, the president of the
Houthis\' Supreme Political Council, in a drone strike. Saleh\'s death
marked the [first
time](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/) a
senior member of the Houthi movement was successfully assassinated in
such a way.]{.underline}**

**[UAE Wing Loong drones [have
also](https://www.defensenews.com/unmanned/2019/05/02/uae-allegedly-using-chinese-drones-for-deadly-airstrikes-in-libya/) carried
out strikes in support of General Khalifa Haftar\'s ongoing siege of
Libya\'s capital Tripoli. So far, that siege has killed at least 600
people and displaced 90,000 since it began in early April. Use of UAE
drones is in violation of the UN arms embargo on Libya.]{.underline}**

**[All these cases indicate that China\'s willingness to fill a large
part of the arms market the West has avoided in the Middle East is doing
little more than making the various conflicts in this region even more
dangerous and destructive.]{.underline}**

### Iran exports !

#### Iran is selling drones to the Houthis now -- that is allowing them to more accurately bomb enemies in Yemen

**Dehghanpisheh**, **7-17**-2019 (Babak, a Senior Reporter with Reuters

- I don't know if this is a good card, it casts a ton of doubt on
  whether or not Iran sold to the Houthis, if anything it's a card that
  says that Iran has the capability to export drones now.

**[Iran has passed on its drones and technical expertise to regional
allies, current and former security officials and analysts
say.]{.underline}**

**[The Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah advise the Houthis on the use
of drones and operate video uplinks from Tehran and Beirut to beam in
technical expertise when needed, an official from the Saudi-led
coalition fighting in Yemen said.]{.underline}**

Iran has denied any role in the conflict in Yemen.

**[U.N. experts say the Houthis now have drones that can drop bigger
bombs further away and more accurately than before. In May, drones hit
two oil pumping stations hundreds of kilometers inside Saudi
territory.]{.underline}**

"Either the drones that attacked the pipelines were launched from inside
Saudi territory or the Houthis just significantly upped their capability
with satellite technology and were provided with the capability to
extend the distance," said Brett Velicovich, a drone expert and U.S.
Army veteran, about the May attack.

**[A commander of Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militia closely linked to
Iran, using the nickname Abu Abdullah, told Reuters in 2014 that Iran
had provided training for operating drones, which were mostly used to
target Islamic State positions.]{.underline}**

**[He said at the time that they had also used the drones to carry out
surveillance on American military positions in Iraq and in the conflict
in Syria, where Kataib Hezbollah fought in support of President Bashar
al-Assad. ]{.underline}**

First, **[withholding military technology from close allies and partners

LH) China's drone technology has caught up and overtaken the United
States. [China has made major advances in swarm control technology and
now finds a ready market for its advanced drones in countries across the
Middle East and Africa. The U.S., Japan and other governments are
struggling to deal with the fact, as drones have opened up a new front
in the modern combat battlefield alongside cyber and space warfare. It
will take aggressive efforts to keep Beijing from dominating this new
battle space. Now is the time for the U.S. and Japan to join forces to
challenge China's drone advantage and build up a formidable arsenal for
our militaries and for those of other liberty-loving
nations.]{.underline} Leveling the Playing Field Civilian drones has
advanced so rapidly that even small armed forces can now cheaply and
easily carry out air strikes on much larger militaries, a capability
once reserved for major powers such as the United States, China, and
Russia. Until very recently, it was considered impossible to attack an
opponent by air when the enemy boasted a strong air defense network and
a more powerful air force. Even the Iraqi army, a formidable mid-sized
regional power under Saddam Hussein, proved incapable of challenging the
air dominance of the U.S. and its allies in the Gulf War and the 2003
Iraq invasion. 00:13 / 00:30 SKIP AD Since 2015, however, new
possibilities have opened up for weaker powers and even guerrilla and
non-state actors, dramatically leveling the playing field. As General
David G. Perkins expressed, bombs loaded on "a quadcopter that cost
\$200 from Amazon.com" can pose a legitimate threat to American forces
in the field. Civilian bomb drones are said to be proliferating in the
Middle East, and a unit of the U.S. Army marching to Mosul, Iraq was
attacked by a drone. To get a sense of the revolution being fashioned by
drone technology, one senior U.S. Air Force official recently observed
that, prior to the Mosul attack, "our ground forces have not come under
attack from enemy aircraft since the Korean War 65 years ago." For the
first time in more than six decades, the great powers find themselves
vulnerable to an attack from the sky. Governments and military
organizations around the world are scrambling to deal with the threat,
which is only likely to grow. Civilian drone makers have succeeded in
developing automatic charging systems, extending flight ranges, and
producing ever more sophisticated drones --- even as prices fall.
Clearly, we must urgently confront this threat. ["The drone society is
coming," Assistant Professor Masaki Minami at Keio University SFC
recently pointed out. "Drones will utilize the space of 15 to 150 meters
\[above ground\] where once only birds, insects, and electric waves had
been active before."]{.underline} Some compare the emerging revolution
to the Cambrian explosion, which produced a massive diversification of
life and the sudden introduction of a vast array of new life forms. The
uses the new drones can be put to, in both the civilian and military
worlds, are only limited by the imagination of the operator. [That makes
China's clear development lead all the more worrying]{.underline}. One
Chinese drone company, DJI, claims 70 percent of the drone market for
individual use. A 2018 exercise in the South China Sea by another
Chinese drone maker involved an "army" of more than 50 tiny, coordinated
drone ships which can be directed to form a "shark swarm" against an
enemy vessel in the event of combat. China has also proven a willing
supplier of its drone technology to some questionable customers. Liberty
is in peril if China dominates this new battle space. Fighting Back ---
Together Fortunately, [both the U.S. and Japan have]{.underline} ---
potentially [--- the industrial and technological resources to
compete.]{.underline} JAMSTEC and Osaka University in Japan have carried
out advanced research in battery technology, special materials such as
carbon for drone construction, and the use of drones underwater. In the
United States, research on large drones and swarm technology has made
major strides, and U.S. military technology remains the best in the
world. But, as the China example shows, [the U.S. and Japan as allies
must move beyond the artificial distinction between civilian and
military drone research and development, and begin implementing policies
on the basis of "national security industries." Security industries in
both countries should collaborate in a much more extensive and
systematic way]{.underline}. Countries in Southeast Asia where the same
principles of liberty are respected should be offered the opportunity to
share in the benefits of this research, to challenge the emerging
Chinese hegemony of drones. Together we can draw on the strength of
American and Japanese industry and brainpower and establish victory in
drones!

#### MTCR is allowing China to meet export demands for UAVs and missiles -- they are selling to potentially bad actors with no checks on who they sell to -- US exports are key to check this

**Zissimos**, 4-26-**2018** (Rachel, Former Policy Analyst, National
Security and Defense Studies \"Export Control Reform: Better Late than
Never,\" Heritage Foundation,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/export-control-reform-better-late-never>)
(CB)

Last Thursday, the **[Trump administration released a [Presidential
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/national-security-presidential-memorandum-regarding-u-s-conventional-arms-transfer-policy/) that
sensibly reforms U.S. conventional arms transfer policy]{.underline}**.
The memo brings U.S. policy into closer alignment with the economic and
security interests of the U.S. and its allies, through changes that
reflect the rapid pace of technological innovation and the competitive
global environment.

An updated policy was sorely needed. Many regulations and agreements
governing U.S. arms transfers date back to when the U.S. maintained a
comfortable lead in military innovation. Since that time, globalization
has rapidly expanded other nations' access to advanced technologies and
complicated efforts to contain their spread and use.

**[U.S. export controls are intended to limit proliferation of advanced
technologies.]{.underline}** **[The idea is to exercise restraint in the
transfer and sale of conventional arms, thereby keeping U.S.
capabilities out of the hands of our foes and other repressive
governments that might use them against their own citizens.
Unfortunately, these controls inundate allies and adversaries alike with
the same cumbersome licensing requirements and bureaucratic hurdles.
These processes inhibit opportunities for trade and cooperation---to the
detriment of U.S. industry. ]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, **[foreign militaries have chipped away at the U.S.
technological edge, increasing the number of countries willing and able
to sell advanced technologies in a burgeoning world
market.]{.underline}** Governments dismayed by U.S. policy (or prices)
can turn to other exporting countries for comparable systems.

The new policy addresses these failings, placing particular emphasis on
the domestic and international regulation of unmanned aerial systems
(UAS), commonly referred to as drones.

**[The U.S. is one of 35 signatories to the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR)---a multinational agreement
promoting voluntary restrictions on the transfer of missiles and missile
technology.  Under the MTCR, unmanned systems (whether armed or unarmed)
"[capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kg to a range of at
least 300 km](http://mtcr.info/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/)" are
categorized among the most heavily regulated items, for which export
requests "[are subject to an unconditional strong presumption of
denial](http://mtcr.info/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/)."]{.underline}**

**[As could be expected, the MTCR has been principally effective in
limiting the sales of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by its
signatories. The result has been to keep valuable capabilities away from
countries with overlapping security interests.  Meanwhile, China has
jumped to meet the global market demand, exercising far less restraint
and discernment about to whom it will sell both armed and unarmed UAVs.
As China expands its share of the global UAV market, it also expands its
influence in the regulation and use of autonomous
systems.]{.underline}**

Arms transfers will always carry a level of risk. But the U.S. is no
longer the only player in the game. The administration's new policy
recognizes the limitations of previous regulations.

Now, **[the U.S. must work to eliminate obsolete and bureaucratic
barriers to U.S. exports, including inefficient licensing requirements
and outdated technology controls. A system that is streamlined and
responsive to global economic and security environments will better
support U.S. industries, and advances the best interests of the U.S.,
its partners, and allies]{.underline}**

coalition operations in the current security environment,
**[interoperability is key to increasing operational effectiveness and

#### Chinese drone sales are key to their sphere of influence in the One Belt One Road initiative and in the Middle East 

**Paulsson**, 11-10-**2018** (Henrik, PhD at Swedish Defence University,
\"Explaining the Proliferation of China's Drones,\" Diplomat,
<https://thediplomat.com/2018/11/explaining-the-proliferation-of-chinas-drones/>)
(CB)

**[Chinese armed drones have been operated or ordered by 17
countries]{.underline}**. While visually similar to the U.S. and Israeli
drones, China's are cheaper and less advanced -- all the while quite
operational. What is curious is to whom the Chinese are selling to, and
their relation to wider policies and strategic choices. **[The buyers
are widely dispersed; China has an interest in building links with these
countries because of geographic position, economic conditions, or
political situation. Most already have Chinese investments, loans, and
other weaponry.]{.underline}**

**[Many of the countries importing Chinese drones lie along the path of
China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan and Myanmar have
long-standing ties with China, and both are now flying Chinese armed
dron]{.underline}**es, with Pakistan even producing a licensed version
of the Wing Loong II model. Further inland, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan,
and Uzbekistan have all received armed drones from China. **[All five of
these countries are critical for the BRI to function, and have seen
increasing Chinese investments and connections over recent years --
including significant military investments in addition to the
drones.]{.underline}**

**[Chinese interests extend also into Africa. Egypt, Algeria, and the
Ethiopian involvement in Somalia all have roles to play in the continued
viability of maritime trade from China to Europe]{.underline}**.
**[Zambia has large Chinese investments in their mining regions, while
Nigeria has oil and importantly lies on the Gulf of
Guinea.]{.underline}** These African and the above mentioned Asian
states are positioned along vital trade routes, giving China a distinct
interest in building relationships and providing tools to help secure
trade. The combination of both trade and investments provides ample
excuse to provide drones in addition to other weaponry -- all with
increased ties to the Chinese military and defense industry.

**[In the Middle East China is more opportunistic in selling their armed
drones, supplying them to countries that cannot get drones from Israel
or the United States for economic or political reasons]{.underline}**.
**[While the Israeli constraint is obvious, Iraq and Jordan are both
hindered by the high cost of U.S. drones -- instead opting for Chinese
versions for their fight against the Islamic State]{.underline}**.
Politically, **[the Saudi- and Emirati-led campaign in Yemen is more
problematic, where they are accused of war crimes utilizing Chinese
drones. The lessening influence of the United States in the Persian Gulf
also provides inroads for China to replace Washington, with their drones
being a useful tool in this endeavor.]{.underline}**

No matter the location, **[all of the operators get pulled toward China.
The sale of drones causes an increasing dependence on Chinese materiel
-- such as spare parts and missiles -- to operate in the first
place.]{.underline}** **[The drones also create a necessity to maintain
defense ties with China for training and operations.]{.underline}**
These are, after all, quite advanced and complicated machines. In their
armed drones, China has found a way to increase their influence and
expand their presence with any country that that the United States and
Israel will not -- or cannot -- sell to.

#### The Chinese sphere of influence undercuts US hegemony

**Gilley and O'Neil 14** (Bruce, associate professor of political
science at the Mark Hatfield School of Government at Portland State
University, Andrew, Professor of Political Science, Georgetown
university press, <http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zswkb.7>) (CB)

The role of middle powers in constraining hegemons (baquanguo), as
emphasized by Qian and others, obviously refers to the United States.
But **[China too aspires to being a great power with hegemonic
potential]{.underline}**, especially in Asia. **[This points up the
fundamental challenge for China to pursue a middle power--like
diplomacy]{.underline}**: **[as a historical great power and a
contemporary rising one, it is just as likely as the United States to
scorn the concept]{.underline}**. Moreover, unlike rising India, which
has been able to retain its middle power identity and middle
power--style ''niche diplomacy'' of multipolarity and peace building
despite its positional rise because of domestically determined
cosmopolitanism and emphasis on compromise, China has neither of these
attributes.30 Its self-identity is built upon an exclusive form of
nationalism and its domestic politics are characterized by ﬁnality and
coercion. **[While the United States shares with China a self-identity
built on unique national characteristics, the pursuit of those aims by
Washington is signiﬁcantly constrained by its democratic character.
China looked something like an aligned middle power]{.underline}** (like
today's Canada or Australia) **[from 1949 until it began to detach
itself from the Soviet Union with the ﬁrst Khrushchev-Mao meeting in
Beijing in 1958.]{.underline}** **[This was followed by a period from
1958 until 1972, when China played a role in world politics that, but
for its size, has been described as akin to that of a middle
power.]{.underline}**31 For instance, its high proﬁle at the Afro-Asian
Conference begun at Bandung in 1955 signiﬁed its commitment to
multilateralism, sovereign equality, and nonalignment. China's return to
great power status with the Sino-US reconciliation meant that it lost
its leadership role within the nonaligned movement. But in a
sense, China has never stopped thinking of itself as a counterhegemonic
great power with middle power sensibilities. **[From 1997 to 2001, China
promoted a ''new security concept'' in Asia. The soft edge of this was a
reiteration of ''the ASEAN Way'' of consensus, mutual respect,
Westphalian noninterference, and multilateralism. But the hard edge was
the attempt to dismantle the United States--centered huband-spoke
alliances of the San Francisco System as the region's security
architecture]{.underline}**.32 **[China subsequently dropped this hard
edge, having been told by ASEAN states about the indispensability of the
American presence]{.underline}**.33 **[Middle and small powers in Asia
seek a continued US presence not just to hedge against a rising China,
but also to avoid Japanese rearmament and to manage nongreat power
rivalries within the region]{.underline}**---between Malaysia and
Indonesia, for instance, or Cambodia and Thailand.34 Jakarta's notion of
a ''dynamic equilibrium'' in Asian politics is one that gradually
accommodates China's great power role but only alongside a continued
American one.35 **[The more closely US-aligned South Korea, meanwhile,
signed military cooperation agreements with Indonesia in 2008 and with
Australia in 201]{.underline}**1. In the latter case, the defense
ministers said in a joint statement that the two countries are
''like-minded middle powers'' and ''natural security partners.''36
**[Yet neither country has been willing to pursue the maintenance of the
US-centric regional security architecture that Washington
desir]{.underline}**es. This is consistent with middle power
nonalignment. **[China's intention continues to be a widening of its
acknowledged sphere of inﬂuence and ''core interests'' in Asia at the
expense of the United States]{.underline}**. This is where middle powers
come in, Ding believes. By bandwagoning with middle powers, China would
gain ''global strategic space. ''Speciﬁcally, cooperation with middle
powers on ''secondary'' issues like the environment, human rights,
development, and foreign aid, Beijing could ''weaken some of the
pressures that great powers use to squeeze China.''

#### US Hegemony prevents extinction

**Barnett 11** (Thomas P.M., Former Senior Strategic Researcher and
Professor in the Warfare Analysis & Research Department, Center for
Naval Warfare Studies, U.S. Naval War College American military
geostrategist and Chief Analyst at Wikistrat., worked as the Assistant
for Strategic Futures in the Office of Force Transformation in the
Department of Defense, "The New Rules: Leadership Fatigue Puts U.S., and
Globalization, at Crossroads,")

Events in Libya are a further reminder for [Americans]{.underline} that
we [stand at a crossroads in our continuing evolution as the world\'s
sole full-service superpower.]{.underline} Unfortunately**,** we are
increasingly seeking change without cost, and shirking from risk because
we are tired of the responsibility. We don\'t know who we are anymore,
and our president is a big part of that problem. Instead of leading us,
he explains to us. Barack Obama would have us believe that he is
practicing strategic patience. But many experts and ordinary citizens
alike have concluded that he is actually beset by strategic incoherence
\-- in effect, a man overmatched by the job. It is worth first examining
the larger picture: We live in a time of arguably the greatest
structural change in the global order yet endured, with this historical
moment\'s most amazing feature being its relative and absolute lack of
mass violence. That is something to consider when Americans contemplate
military intervention in Libya, because if we do take the step to
prevent larger-scale killing by engaging in some killing of our own, we
will not be adding to some fantastically imagined global death count
stemming from the ongoing \"megalomania\" and \"evil\" of American
\"empire.\" We\'ll be engaging in the same sort of system-administering
activity that has marked our stunningly successful stewardship of global
order since World War II. Let me be more blunt: [[As the guardian of
globalization, the U.S.]{.mark} military [has been the greatest force
for peace]{.mark} the world has ever known[. Had America been
removed]{.mark} [from]{.mark} [the]{.mark} global dynamics that governed
the [20th]{.mark} [century]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} mass [murder never
would have ended.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Indeed, it\'s entirely
conceivable [there would]{.mark} now [be no]{.mark} identifiable human
[civilization]{.mark} left[, once nuclear weapons entered]{.mark} the
killing equation[.]{.mark} But the world did not keep sliding down that
path of perpetual war. Instead, [America]{.mark} stepped up and [changed
everything by]{.mark} ushering in our now-perpetual [great-power
peace.]{.mark} We introduced the international liberal trade order known
as globalization and played loyal Leviathan over its spread. [What
resulted was]{.mark} the collapse of empires[, an explosion of
democracy, the]{.mark} persistent [spread of]{.mark} human
[rights,]{.mark} the [liberation of women,]{.mark} the [doubling of life
expectancy, a]{.mark} roughly [10-fold increase in]{.mark} adjusted
[global GDP and a]{.mark} profound and persistent [reduction in battle
deaths from]{.mark} state-based [conflicts]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is
what American \"hubris\" actually delivered. Please remember that the
next time some TV pundit sells you the image of \"unbridled\" American
military power as the cause of global disorder instead of its cure. With
self-deprecation bordering on self-loathing, we now imagine a
post-American world that is anything but. Just watch who scatters and
who steps up as the Facebook revolutions erupt across the Arab world.
While we might imagine ourselves the status quo power, we remain the
world\'s most vigorously revisionist force. As for the sheer \"evil\"
that is our military-industrial complex, again, let\'s examine what the
world looked like before that establishment reared its ugly head. The
last great period of global structural change was the first half of the
20th century, a period that saw a death toll of about 100 million across
two world wars. That comes to an average of 2 million deaths a year in a
world of approximately 2 billion souls. Today, with far more
comprehensive worldwide reporting, researchers report an average of less
than 100,000 battle deaths annually in a world fast approaching 7
billion people. [Though admittedly crude, these calculations suggest a
90 percent absolute drop and a 99 percent relative drop in deaths due to
war. [We are]{.mark} clearly [headed for a world order
characterized]{.mark} by [multipolarity, something the American-birthed
system was designed to]{.mark} both [encourage and accommodate.]{.mark}
But [given how things turned out the last time]{.mark} we collectively
faced such a fluid structure[, we would do well to keep U.S.
power,]{.mark} in all of its forms, deeply [embedded]{.mark} in the
geometry to come.]{.underline} To continue the historical survey, after
salvaging Western Europe from its half-century of civil war, the U.S.
emerged as the progenitor of a new, far more just form of globalization
\-- one based on actual free trade rather than colonialism. America then
successfully replicated globalization further in East Asia over the
second half of the 20th century, setting the stage for the Pacific
Century now unfolding.

# Case Neg- MTCR

## China & Iran aren't in MTCR

#### China is not an MTCR partner

**Congressional Research Service**. 2- 22-**19.** The Congressional
Research Service is a subcommittee within the Library of Congress
responsible for nonpartisan policy and legal analysis. "U.S.-Proposed
Missile Technology Control Regime Changes"
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/IF11069.pdf

The United States has exported MTCR Category I UAS to France, Italy,
Germany, and the United Kingdom; all of these governments are MTCR
partners. [Press and nongovernmental expert reports also name China and
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as exporters of MTCR Category I
UAS]{.underline}**. [China is not an MTCR partner]{.underline}** [but
agreed in 1992 to adhere to the MTCR guidelines]{.underline}. The UAE is
not an MTCR partner; the government has no policy concerning Category I
UAS exports, a UAE government representative told CRS on December 26,
adding that the country needs no such policy because it does not produce
or export such systems. Potential Threat Experts have expressed concern
for at least 25 years that UAS proliferation would enable the spread of
NBC weapons; specifically, some observers have argued that hostile
actors could convert some types of UAS into cruise missiles or
incorporate UAS technology into such missiles. RAND reports from 2014
and 2018 have downplayed this risk, however. Whether any country is
acquiring or attempting to acquire UAS for developing or producing
cruise missiles is unclear. Some observers have also warned that hostile
governments or nonstate actors could use UAS for disseminating chemical
and biological agents.

**[China has a problematic history of proliferation that makes it
inconsistent with the views of the MTCR.]{.underline}** Victor
**Zaborsky**. October 5, 20**04."**Does China Belong in the Missile
Control Regime. Victor Zaborsky specializes in nonproliferation and arms
export, at the Center for International Trade and Security at the
University of Georgia at Athens, as a senior research associate.
[**https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_10/Zaborsky**](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_10/Zaborsky)

[**The prospect that China might soon join a U.S.-initiated regime aimed
at controlling ballistic missiles might seem laughable. After all, the
United States has imposed sanctions on China for years for hawking
missiles** and missile technologies **to dozens of countries** scattered
around the globe]{.underline}. Yet, this month a gathering of U.S. and
other diplomats in Seoul could signal support for China's bid to join
the two-decades-old Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Although
[**the effort is likely to spur opposition from** defense hawks worried
about the growth of China's military power and **those who oppose any
cooperation with China because of trade or human rights
disputes**]{.underline}, backing China's entry into the MTCR is the
right call. China has recently improved its export controls and has
adjusted other policies so as to play a more cooperative and active role
in nonproliferation efforts. Allowing Beijing to join the regime will
support these positive trends toward transparency and prevent
backsliding, particularly as MTCR membership could grant the right to
participate in cooperative projects with fellow members of interest to
the Chinese government and key industries. Leaving China out of the
MTCR, on the other hand, is only likely to encourage Beijing to continue
selling missile technology to countries of concern. Negotiations to
create an MTCR began in 1983 and reached fruition in 1987. The initial
membership consisted of seven economically developed, technically
advanced, and largely Western states---Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These founding
countries viewed themselves as having a mission to control transfers of
missile technology to the rest of the world, primarily to the Communist
bloc and countries with nuclear weapons programs[. Communist China with
its ICBM force was viewed by the Western nations as a particular threat
and as one of the "target" countries with which the MTCR members should
strictly control their missile exports]{.underline}. The MTCR restricts
exports of missiles and related technology capable of carrying a
500-kilogram payload at least 300 kilometers or delivering any type of
weapon of mass destruction. In the early 1990s, [the proliferation
concerns with respect to China became twofold. In addition to concerns
about missile proliferation to China, there emerged a challenge of
missile proliferation from China.]{.underline} Although it remained a
targeted recipient of MTCR-controlled technologies, China became a
supplier of MTCR-restricted missiles, components, and technologies to
countries such as Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and
Syria.[\[1\]](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_10/Zaborsky#notes1)
In other words, it had become an exporter not bound by any missile
nonproliferation export control obligations. During this period, the
United States assumed the role of the principal "watchdog" over China's
alleged missile sales. U.S. officials sought to use sanctions as levers
to encourage China to follow MTCR guidelines, even though Beijing was
not a regime member. All told, Washington has imposed sanctions on China
10 times, including three times last year. In response, Beijing has
repeatedly assured Washington that it would end the sales and twice
endorsed joint statements avowing that they would respect MTCR
guidelines. Nevertheless, [Beijing has been accused of adhering to an
overly narrow interpretation of the MTCR restrictions]{.underline} and
neglecting the nonproliferation spirit and standards set by the regime's
"founding fathers" (see sidebar). The limits of this approach have
clearly frustrated U.S. policymakers. As Assistant Secretary of State
for Verification and Compliance Paula DeSutter stated in July 2003,
**["At the highest levels, the Chinese government has claimed that it
opposes missile proliferation.... Unfortunately, the reality has been
quite
different]{.underline}**."[\[2\]](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_10/Zaborsky#notes2)

decision-making meeting, the 34 members of the [Missile Technology
Control Regime (MTCR)](https://www.armscontrol.org/pdf/MTCR.pdf) made no
mention of China's membership bid, but a U.S. government official told
*Arms Control Today* Oct. 15 that the absence of such a statement was
evidence of Beijing falling short. **[Members could not reach the
necessary consensus to offer China membership]{.underline}** because of
concerns about Beijing living up to the regime's export control and
behavior standards, according to the official, who added, "They're not
there yet." In the weeks preceding the MTCR meeting, [the United States
imposed proliferation sanctions on eight Chinese companies]{.underline}.
One of those, Xinshidai, was specifically accused of missile
proliferation. The others, two of which the Bush administration

them.

[The proliferation of ballistic missiles has been a major international
security concern for many years.]{.underline}1 Efforts to address this
concern, centered on the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), have
had a mixed record.2 The MTCR seeks to curb missile proliferation by
denying regional powers the technology to build missiles. In the MTCR's
ªrst decade, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, South Africa, South
Korea, Syria, and Taiwan were thwarted from advancing their missile
ambitions. In light of these positive developments, MTCR members
expressed satisfaction with the regime at its tenth anniversary in 1997.
[Yet in subsequent years, India, **Iran,** Israel, North Korea, and
Pakistan **launched medium-range missiles,** and several other states
have expanded their missile programs, **demonstrating the MTCR's
limitations**]{.underline}**.** To augment the regime, MTCR members
drafted the International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile
Proliferation.3 In November 2002 ninety-three countries signed the code,
which calls on states to make their missile policies more transparent.

**The MTCR has 35 partner countries that excludes China and Iran.**

**MTCR. No Date.** The Missile Technology Control Regime is an informal
political agreement between partner nations to limit the proliferation
of missiles internationally. "Missile Technology Control Regime:
Frequently Asked Questions"
<http://mtcr.info/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/>

There are **[currently 35 countries that are members (Partners) of the
MTCR]{.underline}**: [Argentina (1993); Australia (1990); Austria
(1991); Belgium (1990); Brazil (1995); Bulgaria (2004); Canada (1987);
Czech Republic (1998); Denmark (1990); Finland (1991); France (1987);
Germany (1987); Greece 1992); Hungary (1993); Iceland (1993); India
(2016); Ireland (1992); Italy (1987); Japan (1987); Luxemburg (1990);
Netherlands (1990); New Zealand (1991); Norway (1990); Poland (1998);
Portugal (1992); Republic of Korea (2001); Russian Federation (1995);
South Africa (1995); Spain (1990); Sweden (1991); Switzerland (1992);
Turkey (1997); Ukraine (1998); United Kingdom (1987); United States of
America (1987]{.underline}). The date in brackets represents the initial
year of membership.4. What is the purpose of the MTCR? The MTCR was
initiated by like-minded countries to address the increasing
proliferation of nuclear weapons by addressing the most destabilizing
delivery system for such weapons. In 1992, [the MTCR's original focus on
missiles for nuclear weapons delivery was extended to a focus on the
proliferation of missiles]{.underline} for the delivery of all types of
weapons of mass destruction (WMD), i.e., nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons. Such proliferation has been identified as a threat
to international peace and security. One way to counter this threat is
to maintain vigilance over the transfer of missile equipment, material,
and related technologies usable for systems capable of delivering WMD.

[**MTCR guidelines are an informal standard set** by a selected group of
countries rather than an international treaty adopted by its
members**.**]{.underline} [**The agreement has no legally binding
provisions** or regime-wide compliance procedures. If disagreements
occur, member states can consult bilaterally to clarify the issue, or
bring their concerns up at the MTCR's annual policy-level Plenary
Meeting]{.underline}. For instance, MTCR guidelines were updated in 2002
to standardize how the range of cruise missiles is calculated after
France and the U.K. sold a Storm Shadow (Black Shaheen) cruise missile
to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France and the UK
[claimed](http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/204051/saudi-arabia-storm-shadow-the-mtcr/)
that the missile sale was in compliance with the MTCR, as its range was
less than 300 km calculated at sea level. The U.S. calculated the
missile's range at altitude to be over 400 km, and thus considered its
sale a violation. **[While the agreement outlines no legal repercussion
for breaking the adopted standards of the MTCR]{.underline}**, [the
United States government has passed legislation [allowing for the
introduction of
sanctions](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2797b)]{.underline}
against any nations that export items restricted by the MTCR agreement,

[The **MTCR is an informal non-treaty association** of governments
sharing common interests, and therefore has no formal mechanism to
enforce compliance.]{.underline} The **[implementation of the MTCR is
dependent on the resolve of its Member States]{.underline}**. The Member
States usually deal with the implementation of the MTCR somewhat
differently. The United States, being the most ardent MTCR participant,
backs the implementation of the MTCR by a sanctions law, whereas other
States have used a more low-profile approach. All nine states known or
believed to possess nuclear weapons -- China, France, India, Israel,
North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States
-- possess missiles of considerable range to deliver them. Iran, Japan,
North Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Taiwan, and Ukraine also possess
missiles or satellite launch rockets of substantial range, but do not
possess nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction. China's
sale of some tens of 3,000-km range DF-3 (CSS-2) missiles to Saudi
Arabia in 1988 -- the only transfer of missiles having a range greater
than 600 km (aside from the US sale of Polaris and Trident missiles to
Britain) -- caused an international uproar and helped strengthen
measures such as the MTCR. No further sales have occurred. On 29 March,
an MTCR delegation made an [outreach
mission](http://mtcr.info/report-by-the-mtcr-co-chairs-outreach-visit-to-pakistan/)
to Pakistan. The delegation updated representatives from Pakistan's
defense and export control sectors on the outcomes of the 2017 Dublin
Plenary and heard from the Pakistani representatives about new export
control legislation.

## Solvency

### Drones solve miscalc

#### Drones are stabilizing -- they ensure conflicting states can reassure themselves through surveillance 

**Horowitz, Kreps, Fuhrmann**, 1-25-**2016** (Michael C., Sarah E.,
Matthew, professor of political science at the University of
Pennsylvania, American political scientist who has written extensively
on drones and drone warfare, and professor of political science at the
University of Pennsylvania respectively, "The Consequences of Drone
Proliferation: Separating Fact from Fiction") (CB)

**[This paper conducts a comprehensive assessment of the consequences of
current-generation drone proliferation]{.underline}**, concluding that
both of these perspectives are misguided. **[Examining the effects of
UAVs in]{.underline}** six different contexts -- counterterrorism,
**[interstate conflict,]{.underline}** crisis onset and deterrence,
coercive **[diplomacy]{.underline}**, domestic control and repression,
and use by non-state actors for the purposes of terrorism -- we show
that, while current-generation drones will introduce some unique
capabilities into conflicts around the world, they are also unlikely to
produce the dire consequences that some fear. In particular, drone
proliferation carries potentially significant consequences for
counterterrorism operations and domestic control in authoritarian
regimes. Drones lower the costs of using force by eliminating the risk
that pilots will be killed, making some states -- especially democracies
-- more likely to carry out targeted attacks against suspected
militants. This technology also could provide autocratic leaders with a
new tool to bolster their domestic regime security. Yet, in general,
current-generation **[drones are likely to have a minimal impact on
interstate relations]{.underline}**. **[Armed or advanced unarmed drones
are unlikely to provoke international crises or incite regional
instability]{.underline}**. In addition, current-generation drones offer
little utility for coercion against other governments. Contrary to the
conventional wisdom, moreover, **[drones might actually enhance security
in disputed border regions by providing states with greater ability to
monitor contested regions persistently at lower cost, leading to
reassurance that potential adversaries are not attempting to change the
status quo through force]{.underline}**. The limited significance of
current-generation drones in interstate contexts beyond monitoring stems
from a key technological limitation: UAVs currently in operation are
vulnerable to air defense systems, meaning that they are much less
likely to be effective when operating in hostile airspace.

#### The MTCR is allowing China to sell arms to nations the US cannot -- that is causing harmful prolif and leads to middle eastern arms races

**Iddon**, **7-4**-2019 (Paul, a freelance journalist based in Erbil,
Iraqi Kurdistan who writes about Middle East affairs, \"How China is
heavily contributing to Middle East drone and missile proliferation,\"
alaraby,
<https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/indepth/2019/7/4/china-is-heavily-contributing-to-middle-east-drone-proliferation>)
(CB)

**[The People\'s Republic of China has contributed significantly to the
proliferation of both ballistic missiles and armed drones in the Middle
East and shows no sign of reversing course in the foreseeable
future.]{.underline}**

**[While the United States and its European allies have long sold their
Middle East clients billions worth of arms]{.underline}**, even when
those clients committed war crimes, **[they have routinely restricted
the sale of both ballistic missiles and armed drones.]{.underline}**

**[This is due to fears that such lethal weapons could fall into the
wrong hands and because the US, most of Europe and Russia are all
signatories of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), which seeks
to prevent the proliferation of such weapon]{.underline}**s.
**[China]{.underline}**, on the other hand, **[is not a signatory of the
MTCR.]{.underline}**

**[Citing US intelligence sources]{.underline}**, a
recent [CNN exclusive](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/05/politics/us-intelligence-saudi-arabia-ballistic-missile-china/index.html) confirmed
that **[Saudi Arabia has been \"significantly escalating\" its ballistic
missile programme with China\'s help.]{.underline}**

This had previously been suspected in January, when satellite
images [revealed](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2019/2/20/saudi-long-range-missile-factory-sparks-fears-over-weapons-proliferation) that
the Saudis now possess what appears to be a ballistic missile factory
and testing stand apparently based on a Chinese design.\
\
**[The Saudis stockpile of ballistic missiles originates from China. In
the late 1980s, the kingdom procured long-range nuclear-capable DF-3A
ballistic missiles, which were first introduced in 1971. They were
displayed to the public for the first time ever in a military parade
back in April 2014]{.underline}**.

In 2007, the Saudis
also [acquired](https://www.newsweek.com/exclusive-cia-helped-saudis-chinese-missile-deal-227283) more
accurate DF-21 ballistic missiles from China. The US approved the deal
on the condition that the CIA was first allowed to inspect the missiles
and verify they were not nuclear-capable.

  --

  --

Today, **[Beijing is providing Riyadh with unspecified assistance to
expand the Saudi \"missile infrastructure and
technology]{.underline}**\" according to CNN. This revelation, coupled
with the aforementioned disclosure of the missile facility earlier this
year, indicates that China is giving the Saudis the know-how and
infrastructure to build their own missiles.

Over time, **[that could enable the Saudis to engage in a ballistic
missile arms race with their Iranian adversaries on the other side of
the Gulf.]{.underline}**

**[This wouldn\'t be surprising nor all that unprecedented since China
previously has helped Turkey develop its own ballistic missile
arsenal]{.underline}**. This began in the late 1990s when Ankara made a
deal that allowed it to produce licensed Chinese B-611 missiles. 

Out of this Turkey manufactured the J-600T Yıldırım tactical ballistic
missile with Chinese technology. These missiles were first shown to the
Turkish public in 2007. There are at least [two variants of that
missile](https://www.dailysabah.com/defense/2017/11/08/turkey-expanding-missile-defense-capabilities-by-inking-deal-with-eurosam-1510130325),
the first with a range of 150km and the second with a range of 300km.

In 2017, **[the Bora-1 ballistic missile entered service. It was made by
the Turkish arms manufacturer and contractor Roketsan and is reportedly
built with domestically-made components]{.underline}**, although the
guidance system is American-made. According to Roketsan the Bora-1 can
hit targets from up to 280km away and is accurate to within 50 metres.
It carries a 470kg warhead.

**[Turkey is also a signatory of the MTCR, which [seeks to
ban](https://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/turkey/j-600.htm) countries
from importing or exporting missiles with warheads heavier than 500kg
and ranges exceeding 300km.]{.underline}** This means that the Bora-1,
which Turkey also intends to export, and the J-600T are in compliance
with these limitations.

Turkey\'s Bora-2 project, on the other hand, [has raised
eyebrows](https://www.defensenews.com/land/2018/05/02/turkey-seeks-to-expand-range-of-locally-built-missile/) since
Ankara says it seeks to expand the range of the Bora-1. It would make
little sense for Turkey to invest in building a new missile with an
extended range of a mere 20km and a warhead only 30kg heavier than the
Bora-1\'s.

This suggests future Turkish missiles may exceed the limitations set by
the MTCR.

  --

  --

Unconfirmed Turkish press reports claimed the Bora-1 has already been
used against Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK) targets in a cross border
strike into Iraqi Kurdistan in late May.

If true this would be the first time Turkey used such a missile in
combat as well as [another worrying
indication](http://www.rudaw.net/english/analysis/01062019)that Middle
East states are more readily using such weapons in the region\'s
conflicts. \
\
Iran, for example, also preemptively targeted and destroyed a Kurdish
opposition group\'s headquarters deep inside Iraqi Kurdistan using its
own Fateh-110 ballistic missiles last September.

While the Bora-1 is likely a more improved version of the J-600T with
much more locally-developed components its existence is doubtlessly
thanks to Beijing\'s initial willingness to help Ankara get a ballistic
missile programme off the ground in the first place.  

China also secretly sold Qatar short-range SY-400 ballistic missiles,
which were [publicly
revealed](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/china-secretly-sold-qatar-short-range-ballistic-missiles-23770) in
the country\'s December 2017 National Day military parade.

**[In recent years, Beijing has supplied armed drones to several
countries in the Middle East, contributing greatly to the proliferation
of these weapons in the troubled region in clear contravention of the
MTCR\'s noble objectives.]{.underline}**

**[China\'s Wing Loong II drones are essentially complete replicas of
the American Predator drone and fire the Chinese equivalent to the
American Hellfire air-to-ground missile.]{.underline}** China have sold
them to states across the Middle East which has directly contributed to
the proliferation of these unmanned weapons.

  --

  --

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has notably used Wing Loongs in the
controversial Saudi-led air campaign against the Houthis in Yemen, which
has contributed greatly to that country\'s destruction and misery since
it began in early 2015.

**[In April 2018, the UAE killed Saleh al-Samad, the president of the
Houthis\' Supreme Political Council, in a drone strike. Saleh\'s death
marked the [first
time](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/) a
senior member of the Houthi movement was successfully assassinated in
such a way.]{.underline}**

**[UAE Wing Loong drones [have
also](https://www.defensenews.com/unmanned/2019/05/02/uae-allegedly-using-chinese-drones-for-deadly-airstrikes-in-libya/) carried
out strikes in support of General Khalifa Haftar\'s ongoing siege of
Libya\'s capital Tripoli. So far, that siege has killed at least 600
people and displaced 90,000 since it began in early April. Use of UAE
drones is in violation of the UN arms embargo on Libya.]{.underline}**

**[All these cases indicate that China\'s willingness to fill a large
part of the arms market the West has avoided in the Middle East is doing
little more than making the various conflicts in this region even more
dangerous and destructive.]{.underline}**

### Drones = stability

#### Drone exports [do not]{.underline} cause instability

**Greenberg**, 4-24-2018 (Erik Lin, PhD candidate in the Department of
Political Science at Columbia University, where he studies international
relations. \"Why Washington's New Drone Export Policy Is Good For
National Security,\" War on the Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/why-washingtons-new-drone-export-policy-is-good-for-national-security/>)
(CB)

**[First, the transfer of drones is unlikely to be inherently
destabilizing]{.underline}**. To be sure, **[the reduced risk associated
with operating remotely piloted aircraft may lead risk-averse
decision-makers to more frequently launch drones on intelligence
gathering and strike missions.]{.underline}** However**[, limited
transfers of drone technology have had a minimal effect on regional
stability.]{.underline}** For
instance, **[[Iraq](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/business/international/china-drone-export-iraq.html) and [Nigeria](https://www.popsci.com/watch-nigerias-first-confirmed-drone-strike) have
used recently acquired drones to launch missile strikes on suspected
terrorists,]{.underline}** **[but these operations have been limited in
scale and geographic scope]{.underline}**. **[Carrying out worldwide
drone operations like those conducted by the United States requires a
massive [technological and logistical
infrastructure](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2016.1134189?journalCode=fsst20),
and as I describe in a [forthcoming book
chapter](http://eriklg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Proofed-Find-em-First_April-2018.pdf),
a complex backbone of intelligence personnel and organizations that
costs billions and takes decades to develop.]{.underline}** Even if
countries acquire drone aircraft, it takes time to develop the required
network of bases, satellites, computer systems, and personnel before a
state can conduct sustained, large-scale drone operations.

#### Drones are inherently stabilizing -- they collect intel that ensure operations are [precise and limited]{.underline} 

**Greenberg**, 4-24-2018 (Erik Lin, PhD candidate in the Department of
Political Science at Columbia University, where he studies international
relations. \"Why Washington's New Drone Export Policy Is Good For
National Security,\" War on the Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/why-washingtons-new-drone-export-policy-is-good-for-national-security/>)
(CB)

Second, **[even if the sale of drones under the new policy triggers
drone arms racing, remotely piloted aircraft often have a stabilizing
effect on crisis situations]{.underline}**. As I have [argued
elsewhere](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/23/so-china-seized-a-u-s-drone-submarine-welcome-to-the-future-of-international-conflict/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f8e399e3db50#comments),
drones allow states to carry out military operations without risking
significant escalation. **[Drones can help stabilize crises by
collecting intelligence that can make subsequent operations more precise
or limited, or can be deployed in lieu of more escalatory means, like
ground forces or manned aircraft.]{.underline}** **[While states may be
more prone to launch drones on risky missions, states are unlikely to
take escalatory military or diplomatic responses after a drone is lost
to enemy action. I]{.underline}**n other words, drones provide a
de-escalatory off-ramp that typically is not an option when inhabited
assets are involved. For instance, **[the Pentagon largely ignored
Syria's [downing of a remotely piloted Predator reconnaissance
drone](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2015/06/29/air-force-lost-predator-was-shot-down-in-syria/) in
2015. In contrast, Syria's recent shoot down of an inhabited Israel Air
Force F-16 fighter in February triggered a massive Israeli retaliation
that
reportedly [destroyed](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/israel-took-out-half-of-syria-s-air-defenses-military-beliefs-1.5808981) half
of Syrian air defenses]{.underline}**.

### Drone Exports good

#### Trumps new DCS export policy is good -- it protects national security and promotes interoperability, international stability, and alliances

- Probably the best card in this file

**Greenberg**, 4-24-2018 (Erik Lin, PhD candidate in the Department of
Political Science at Columbia University, where he studies international
relations. \"Why Washington's New Drone Export Policy Is Good For
National Security,\" War on the Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/why-washingtons-new-drone-export-policy-is-good-for-national-security/>)
(CB)

Last Thursday, **[the State Department [announced its updated export
policy](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280619.htm) for
unmanned aerial systems, popularly known as drones. While the White
House [framed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-arms-transfer-unmanned-aerial-systems-export-reforms/) the
new plan as a means to promote American industry, the guidelines ---
which make it easier for the United States to sell drones to foreign
allies --- will almost certainly enhance U.S. national
security]{.underline}**. **[By exporting drones, which are on the wish
lists of militaries around the world, Washington can strengthen ties
with allies, enhance burden-sharing and interoperability during
coalition operations, and prevent strategic competitors like China from
gaining influence among Washington's security partners.]{.underline}**

The new guidelines streamline the sale of both armed and unarmed drones,
while still maintaining stipulations that ensure recipients use exported
drones in accordance with international law and international human
rights law. Specifically, **[the new policy authorizes direct commercial
sales of drone technology, allowing U.S. firms like General Atomics and
Northrop Grumman to directly market certain drones to foreign
governments, rather than relying on the more cumbersome
government-run [Foreign Military
Sales](http://www.dsca.mil/programs/foreign-military-sales-fms) program]{.underline}**.
**[The policy also [eliminates the special scrutiny on laser
designators](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280613.htm) ---
technology that allows drones to cue airstrikes]{.underline}**. Under
earlier policies, these factors often halted drone transfers or extended
U.S. government deliberations on export approval.

**[U.S. drone exports have long been governed by both domestic export
controls and international agreements]{.underline}**. **[These
regulations, like the multilateral [Missile Technology Control
Regime](http://mtcr.info/), were drafted long before unmanned and
remotely piloted aircraft became common features of military
arsenals.]{.underline}** As such, **[these regulations often
characterized long-range drones as cruise missiles]{.underline}**.
**[Because cruise missiles were capable of delivering nuclear or
chemical weapons, there was a "strong presumption of denial" for drone
exports]{.underline}**. The Obama administration [initially
followed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/20/a-new-u-s-policy-makes-it-somewhat-easier-to-export-drones/?utm_term=.63eb6b5b2bcc) these
guidelines because they believed more American exports could lead other
powers to sell drones to states that might use them in ways that
violated international law. **[When it became clear that states like
China and Israel were more than willing to export drones despite U.S.
restraint, the administration released a [drone export
policy](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/02/237541.htm) in
2015 that attempted to advance its national security interests and
slightly ease restrictions on drone exports]{.underline}**. The 2015
policy established a drone-specific framework to govern foreign
transfers, but still required all exports to go through slow government
approval processes.

**[Under past policies, even close U.S. allies faced difficulties
acquiring U.S.
drones. [Italy](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2015/11/05/italy-wins-us-state-dept-ok-to-arm-its-reapers/),
for instance, was unable to arm its U.S.-produced Reapers between 2011
and
2015. [Jordan](http://thehill.com/policy/defense/232045-republican-pushes-drones-for-jordan) was
barred from receiving unarmed variants of Predator drone that it hoped
to use during counter-ISIL operations.]{.underline}**

**[Without access to U.S.-produced drones, states had two options:
either give up drone acquisition efforts or seek out new
suppliers]{.underline}**. Abandoning drone procurement was impractical
since states buy these military technologies to [meet specific military
requirements or to signal technical and military
prowess](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/droning-on-explaining-the-proliferation-of-unmanned-aerial-vehicles/8982612535696D00F6D040DB56C741AF)to
domestic and international audiences. As a result, states --- including
close U.S. allies --- were forced to find suppliers who were more
willing to hawk their wares. [Saudi Arabia and
Jordan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unable-to-buy-u-s-military-drones-allies-place-orders-with-china-1500301716),
for instance, turned to China to build drone fleets filled with Predator
knock-offs,
and [India](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/India-to-receive-armed-Heron-drones-from-Israel-486016) invested
\$400 million on Israeli drones.

**[When allies turn to other states for advanced military technology,
U.S. national security suffers in three critical ways.]{.underline}**

First, **[withholding military technology from close allies and partners
can strain security relationships. Since these partnerships are grounded
in trust, shared interests, and common threats, partners may equate a
state's unwillingness to export drones with waning loyalty and
commitment to other security agreements.]{.underline}** For instance,
**[the former top Italian Air Force general questioned Washington's
initial denial of Italy's request for armed
drones, [arguing](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2015/11/05/italy-wins-us-state-dept-ok-to-arm-its-reapers/) that
"it seemed impossible that a loyal ally could be ruled
out"]{.underline}** **[from receiving armed drones]{.underline}**. **[He
noted that "in Afghanistan, we would have saved Italian lives if we had
had armed drones."]{.underline}** By streamlining the process for
foreign states to acquire U.S. drones, **[the new policy helps reduce
this sort of tension that can engender mistrust and muddy interactions
between Washington and its partners.]{.underline}**

S**[econd, denying exports can degrade effectiveness and
interoperability during coalition operation]{.underline}**s. **[By not
exporting weapons to allies, supplier states potentially limit the
ability of allies to share operational burdens]{.underline}**. For
instance, **[export controls and international agreements that blocked
the transfer of armed drones to many NATO allies left Washington
responsible for operating the bulk of armed drones in
Afghanistan]{.underline}**. **[This demand placed additional strain on
the
already [under-manned](https://www.stripes.com/news/unmanned-now-undermanned-air-force-struggles-to-fill-pilot-slots-for-drones-1.236906) and [overstretched](https://warontherocks.com/2018/01/forever-deployed-combat-dwell-reform-mq-9-crews-beyond-overdue/)American
capacity.]{.underline}** Additionally, **[if states turn to alternate
suppliers, their ability to
easily [operate](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_84112.htm) with
American forces may be reduced. Common systems and similar technical
infrastructure helps streamline information sharing, planning,
maintenance, and operations]{.underline}**. Given the frequency of
coalition operations in the current security environment,
**[interoperability is key to increasing operational effectiveness and
reducing the likelihood of mishaps and confusion during future crises
and contingencies.]{.underline}**

**[Third, and perhaps most strategically important, Washington loses
political and military influence when states turn to other suppliers.
When a state transfers arms, it hopes to establish influence in the
recipient state throughout and beyond the lifecycle of the weapon
system.]{.underline}** **[In the short term, influence is established
via agreements to train personnel or maintain equipment. Producer states
design training curricula and can withhold future deliveries, parts, or
maintenance if a recipient takes actions that run counter to their
interests.]{.underline}**

Over time, **[these relationships often deepen into wider security
partnerships]{.underline}**. **[For instance, personnel who operate
U.S.-produced equipment frequently attend training or exercises in the
United States. There, they gain exposure to U.S. military
principles]{.underline}**, **[culture, and values. Because of these
experiences, these personnel may be selected for professional military
education programs like the U.S. Air Force's [Air War
College](http://www.airuniversity.af.mil/IOS/) later in their
careers]{.underline}**. **[These relationships can strengthen bonds
between personnel from the United States and states that receive
U.S.-built equipment]{.underline}**, ensuring long-term American
influence. The new policy makes it easier for the United States to
provide drones to foreign states, helping to prevent Washington from
losing influence to China and other supplier states who are eager to
increase their global sway.

**[While the export of U.S.-produced drones enhances national security,
what effect will increased drone sales have on international
security?]{.underline}**

Drone proliferation pessimists often lament that weakening drone export
controls will [make it
easier](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/the-moral-hazard-of-drones/) for
states to launch military operations and destabilize security by
triggering arms racing between states eager to one-up their rival's
drone capabilities. These concerns are likely overstated for two
reasons.

**[First, the transfer of drones is unlikely to be inherently
destabilizing]{.underline}**. To be sure, **[the reduced risk associated
with operating remotely piloted aircraft may lead risk-averse
decision-makers to more frequently launch drones on intelligence
gathering and strike missions.]{.underline}** However**[, limited
transfers of drone technology have had a minimal effect on regional
stability.]{.underline}** For
instance, **[[Iraq](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/business/international/china-drone-export-iraq.html) and [Nigeria](https://www.popsci.com/watch-nigerias-first-confirmed-drone-strike) have
used recently acquired drones to launch missile strikes on suspected
terrorists,]{.underline}** **[but these operations have been limited in
scale and geographic scope]{.underline}**. **[Carrying out worldwide
drone operations like those conducted by the United States requires a
massive [technological and logistical
infrastructure](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2016.1134189?journalCode=fsst20),
and as I describe in a [forthcoming book
chapter](http://eriklg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Proofed-Find-em-First_April-2018.pdf),
a complex backbone of intelligence personnel and organizations that
costs billions and takes decades to develop.]{.underline}** Even if
countries acquire drone aircraft, it takes time to develop the required
network of bases, satellites, computer systems, and personnel before a
state can conduct sustained, large-scale drone operations.

Second, **[even if the sale of drones under the new policy triggers
drone arms racing, remotely piloted aircraft often have a stabilizing
effect on crisis situations]{.underline}**. As I have [argued
elsewhere](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/23/so-china-seized-a-u-s-drone-submarine-welcome-to-the-future-of-international-conflict/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f8e399e3db50#comments),
drones allow states to carry out military operations without risking
significant escalation. **[Drones can help stabilize crises by
collecting intelligence that can make subsequent operations more precise
or limited, or can be deployed in lieu of more escalatory means, like
ground forces or manned aircraft.]{.underline}** **[While states may be
more prone to launch drones on risky missions, states are unlikely to
take escalatory military or diplomatic responses after a drone is lost
to enemy action. I]{.underline}**n other words, drones provide a
de-escalatory off-ramp that typically is not an option when inhabited
assets are involved. For instance, **[the Pentagon largely ignored
Syria's [downing of a remotely piloted Predator reconnaissance
drone](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2015/06/29/air-force-lost-predator-was-shot-down-in-syria/) in
2015. In contrast, Syria's recent shoot down of an inhabited Israel Air
Force F-16 fighter in February triggered a massive Israeli retaliation
that
reportedly [destroyed](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/israel-took-out-half-of-syria-s-air-defenses-military-beliefs-1.5808981) half
of Syrian air defenses]{.underline}**.

As drones become an increasingly common fixture on the modern
battlefield, the new export policy marks an important step in managing
their proliferation and promoting Washington's national security
interests. Streamlining the drone export process helps Washington
strengthen ties with allies and partners, enhances interoperability
during coalition operations, and limits the ability of competitors to
jeopardize U.S. influence. But more can be done to ensure allies can
acquire U.S. drones. For instance, one retired Air Force general
just [called for
changes](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/04/white-house-relaxing-drone-exports-heres-good-next-step/147611/) to
the Missile Technology Control Regime that would reclassify drones like
the Reaper and ease their export. Until then, China and other drone
producer states may attempt to woo customers by undercutting U.S.
prices. Or, they might impose fewer political conditions to sales,
allowing exports to states with shadier human rights records.

**[Even if some clients have already purchased drones from other
suppliers, the new policy ensures that Washington is at least in the
game as a viable alternative as states continue to expand their drone
fleets.]{.underline}**

#### Trumps new policy is good -- it [uniquely]{.underline} restores American competitiveness with China in the arms export industry

**[The Trump administration just announced a [new drone export
policy](https://www.defensenews.com/news/pentagon-congress/2018/04/19/trump-admin-rolls-out-new-rules-for-weapon-drone-sales-abroad/?utm_medium=Socialflow&utm_source=Twitter) designed
to make it easier for U.S. companies to export
drones,]{.underline}** [including armed
drones](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-arms/trump-launches-effort-to-boost-u-s-weapons-sales-abroad-idUSKBN1HQ2E6).
Given [concerns](https://cfrd8-files.cfr.org/sites/default/files/pdf/2014/06/Limiting_Armed_Drone_Proliferation_CSR69.pdf) about
the proliferation of these lethal systems, what explains this policy
shift?

U.S. drone export policy is determined both by domestic policy and U.S.
obligations as a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime
([MTCR](https://www.state.gov/t/isn/rls/fs/2017/266847.htm)), a
voluntary export control regime with 35 member states. Created in 1987,
the MTCR
was [designed](https://thebulletin.org/drones-arent-missiles-so-dont-regulate-them-they-are10859) to
prevent the spread of missiles with the potential to carry weapons of
mass destruction.

\[[How can Donald Trump reassure nervous U.S. allies? By giving them
weapons.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/13/can-donald-trump-rely-on-arms-transfers-to-reassure-u-s-allies/?utm_term=.868372e05d43)\]

**[Even though drones are more akin to airplanes than missiles, drones
that can travel more than 300 kilometers and carry a payload of more
than 500 kilograms are subject to the "strong presumption of denial" for
export by MTCR members. As a result, [U.S. armed
drones](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-usa-drones/u-s-government-approves-italys-request-to-arm-its-drones-idUSKCN0ST1VI20151104) have
been approved for sale only to Britain, Italy and France.]{.underline}**

**[What does the new policy say?]{.underline}**

The new policy goes further than the Obama administration's [2015
guidance](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/02/237541.htm) in
a few ways. Certain drone sales can now go through the [direct
commercial
sales](https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2018/280506.htm) process. This
means U.S. manufacturers can export more directly to other countries and
bypass the [foreign military
sales](https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2018/280506.htm) process, which
entails more time-consuming involvement from the U.S. government.

Second, **[the new
rules [reclassify](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280613.htm) drones
with strike-enabling technology, like laser target designators, as
unarmed, which will make it easier to export them.]{.underline}**

Additionally, **[the Trump administration is discussing [changes to the
MTCR](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-arms-drones-exclusive/exclusive-trump-to-boost-exports-of-lethal-drones-to-more-u-s-allies-sources-idUSKBN1GW12D) ---
to no longer classify drones as cruise missiles. This will be hard to
achieve, given that the MTCR operates by consensus, but the Trump
administration could still decide to ease internal U.S. bureaucratic
barriers to overcoming the "strong presumption of denial" that the MTCR
requires members to use when considering exports of certain longer-range
systems. How aggressively the Trump administration is willing to push
the boundaries of the MTCR will determine the long-term significance of
this policy change.]{.underline}**

So, what explains this change in policy? Here are four insights:

**[1. Current efforts to prevent armed drone proliferation are not
working. ]{.underline}**

**[In the past, U.S. drone policy reflected a belief that if the United
States restrained from exporting armed drones by strictly adhering to
the MTCR, then other states, especially ones that regularly abuse human
rights, could not acquire them.]{.underline}**

However, **[according our ongoing research, about 20 countries now have
armed drones. This includes many countries with questionable human
rights records, such as Iran, Egypt, Uzbekistan and
Burma.]{.underline}**

**[So how did armed drones spread, given U.S. restrictions on exports?
Supply and demand. National security concerns, [among other
factors](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-organization/article/droning-on-explaining-the-proliferation-of-unmanned-aerial-vehicles/8982612535696D00F6D040DB56C741AF),
have led many countries to seek armed drones. That demand found a
supplier in China and, to a lesser extent, Israel.]{.underline}**

\[[So what if Iranian drones did strike Syria? We are not entering a
dark age of robotic
warfare.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/04/04/so-what-if-iranian-drones-did-strike-syria-we-are-not-entering-a-dark-age-of-robotic-warfare/?utm_term=.7cdc91a63a1d)\]

**[Of the countries (excluding China) that have acquired armed drones
since 2010, 11 purchased them from China. Another, India,
recently [acquired](http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/India-to-receive-armed-Heron-drones-from-Israel-486016) armed
drones from Israel. While China and
Israel [claim](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/mtcr) to follow
the MTCR's general guidelines, neither are MTCR members.]{.underline}**

**[These trends suggest that drone proliferation may be inevitable ---
and that's a likely reason for the Trump administration's approach to
drone export policy]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[the Trump
administration may believe that if countries buy American, this gives
the United States [greater
influence](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unable-to-buy-u-s-military-drones-allies-place-orders-with-china-1500301716?ns=prod/accounts-wsj) over
how they use their drones than if they buy elsewhere.]{.underline}**

2**[. Current export restrictions put American allies at a comparative
disadvantage.]{.underline}**

**[The Trump administration also wants to [help U.S. allies and
partners](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-arms-transfer-unmanned-aerial-systems-export-reforms/) help
themselves, supporting broader U.S. national security
priorities.]{.underline}** President **[Trump
has [criticized](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-told-in-brussels-that-west-should-focus-on-values-not-only-interests/2017/05/25/7aa1865c-40cd-11e7-9869-bac8b446820a_story.html?utm_term=.1636cdeac89e) NATO
members and other U.S. allies for not spending enough on defense or
doing enough against terrorism. Selling allies a military technology
that is frequently used [against
terrorists](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/somalia/2013-06-11/why-drones-work) may
help address his concerns.]{.underline}**

Initial results from our research also suggest that since 2010,
non-democracies were more likely to acquire armed drones than
democracies. While democracies could not turn to the United States to
provide them with armed drones, China was more than willing to sell
drones to non-democracies with spotty human rights records.
Consequently, the easing of export restrictions may help even the
playing field.

3\. **[Existing export restrictions gave China a strategic
advantage.]{.underline}**

**[By dominating the armed drone export market thus far, China has built
defense relationships with countries around the world --- including U.S.
allies and partners.]{.underline}**

The Obama administration denied requests for armed or advanced unarmed
drones
from [Jordan](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/05/u-s-firm-denied-request-to-market-drones-to-jordan/),
the [United Arab
Emirates](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unable-to-buy-u-s-military-drones-allies-place-orders-with-china-1500301716) and [Iraq](http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/05/08/exclusive-iraq-in-a-major-shift-might-want-some-u-s-troops-back/).
Subsequently, these countries bought armed drones from China. [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.thedailybeast.com/now-the-saudis-have-killer-drones-too) has
also purchased armed drones from China.

**[The Trump administration thus might have thought that a restrictive
drone export policy was ceding influence to China, something of concern,
given that Trump's national security
strategy [characterized](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf) China
as a "competitor" and a "revisionist" power, and Trump
himself [labeled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/trump-alarms-china-with-cold-war-rhetoric-in-state-of-union-address/2018/01/31/006be238-067a-11e8-ae28-e370b74ea9a7_story.html?utm_term=.5a7199842d3d) China
a "rival" in his State of the Union address.]{.underline}**

**[4. Existing export restrictions are costing the U.S. drone
industry.]{.underline}**

**[Restricting drone exports undermines the competitiveness of U.S.
drone producers and reduces their revenue. Most analysts consider U.S.
drones the [most
capable](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unable-to-buy-u-s-military-drones-allies-place-orders-with-china-1500301716) in
the world --- and relaxed restrictions could generate new business to
help U.S. companies. Given Trump's concern with [boosting
exports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-moves-to-crack-down-on-china-trade-with-50-billion-in-tariffs-on-imported-products/2018/03/22/c09309e8-2de3-11e8-8ad6-fbc50284fce8_story.html?utm_term=.3310efb28738) and
reducing the U.S. [trade
deficit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-moves-to-crack-down-on-china-trade-with-50-billion-in-tariffs-on-imported-products/2018/03/22/c09309e8-2de3-11e8-8ad6-fbc50284fce8_story.html?utm_term=.3310efb28738),
increasing drone exports likely appealed on economic grounds, as
well.]{.underline}**

## **MTCR Fails**

### Non MTCR don't follow on

#### The MTCR has been ineffective in curtailing Russia, China, and other secondary producers. 

- This card is from when the US was selling drones, so it means the MTCR
  was "strong",

- Russia not complying means that even members won't do it.

**Carnegie Endowment for International Peace**, 4-12-**2001**, \"How
Effective is the MTCR?,\"
https://carnegieendowment.org/2001/04/12/how-effective-is-mtcr-pub-672

April 16 is the fourteenth anniversary of the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR), an international export control arrangement to hinder the
proliferation of missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass
destruction (WMD). As the Bush Administration sets a non-proliferation
policy agenda, Dr. Richard Speier, consultant on missile proliferation,
assesses the MTCR. MTCR Basics The MTCR is based on a policy, not a
treaty. It focuses on ballistic and cruise missiles capable of
delivering a 500 kilogram payload to a range of 300 kilometers. Any
rockets or unmanned air vehicles with this capability, including space
launch vehicles (SLV\'s), which are \"peaceful\" versions of long-range
missiles, are subject to a strong presumption of export denial. The
regime imposes more flexible export controls on dual-use items. The 33
member states often coordinate their diplomacy to discourage missile
proliferation. Some members (notably the U.S.) back up their diplomacy
with sanctions. [The regime has experienced some visible failures, such
as missile developments in North Korea, India, and
Pakistan]{.underline}. But it has also realized some noteworthy
successes such as the suppression of the Argentine, Egyptian and Iraqi
Condor II ballistic missile program and South African and Central
European missile activities. The MTCR\'s export denials have yielded
quieter successes, such as delays in the Indian and Pakistani programs.
The MTCR provides an international norm for missile non-proliferation.
Among major suppliers of missile technology only North Korea refuses to
acknowledge this norm. MTCR Problems The MTCR faces challenges in at
least three areas: the stability of its rules of restraint, the
technical coverage of its restrictions, and the continued activities of
some missile suppliers. Rules: Last month South Korea became the 33rd
member of the MTCR. The conditions under which they joined allows them
to develop longer range missiles than heretofore, and even to resume
development of an SLV abandoned under U.S. pressure a decade earlier.
After similar concessions to Brazil and Ukraine in the mid-1990\'s, one
may ask: Are governments now joining the MTCR in order to acquire bigger
missiles? [MTCR members have often discussed missile export restraint
with non-member China]{.underline}. Late last year, the U.S. welcomed
China\'s new formulation of the restraint Beijing will [apply. China now
says it will not export \"nuclear-capable ballistic
missiles.]{.underline}\" **[This leaves open the question of how it will
treat such MTCR-restricted items as cruise missiles or missiles capable
of delivering chemical or biological agents]{.underline}** - and whether
multiple sets of rules are now being established. The MTCR rules face
competition from alternative proposals meant to promote missile
restraint among non-members. Last year the MTCR members proposed a
\"code of conduct\" featuring inspections of proscribed missile-related
programs. Some observers fear such dealings could lead to acceptance of
those programs. Last month Russia held an international conference
outside of the MTCR to promote a \"Global Control System\". And the UN
Secretary General and others are proposing global missile
non-proliferation treaties, some offering SLV cooperation as an
incentive for participation by \"have-nots\". Technology: As military
systems evolve is the MTCR adequately covering them? Unmanned air
vehicles (UAV\'s) - cruise missiles and systems readily converted to
them - are particular concerns. Controls on stealthy cruise missiles,
key components such as engines and guidance/control systems, and
definitions of range and payload may be falling behind the times.
Moreover, as large UAV\'s evolve for reconnaissance, missile launching,
and even civilian communications - pressures are growing to relax MTCR
restrictions. Given the likely importance of unmanned combat air
vehicles (UCAV\'s) and other UAV\'s in the Bush Administration\'s
military strategy, these issues will come to the fore very soon.
Suppliers[: As an export control regime the MTCR depends on supplier
restraint]{.underline}. It has succeeded in restricting many potentially
troublesome exports from Western Europe. However, [restraint has been
lacking in three suppliers.]{.underline} Reportedly, **[Russia is
leaking or deliberately supplying MTCR-restricted missile technology to
India and Iran]{.underline}**. **[China\'s latest missile restraint
proclamation has yet to be fully defined and implemented, and China may
be continuing to export missile technology to Pakistan and the Middle
East]{.underline}**. [And North Korea continues to export Scud-based
missiles and their technology. Secondary suppliers such as India and
Iran are a growing concern]{.underline}. Some, such as Iran, are under a
U.S. embargo. **[But for others and for China, U.S. sanctions, designed
especially to restrict exports from MTCR non-members, have been little
used in recent years.]{.underline}** Conclusion The MTCR is not the only
instrument available for missile non-proliferation, but it is the most
widespread instrument with the greatest international recognition. If it
is allowed to weaken, stronger unilateral approaches will be needed - or
there will be a period of more rapid missile proliferation until new
restraints can be imposed. The Bush Administration\'s commitment to the
long-term development of missile defenses would be perfectly
complemented by a renewed effort to prevent missile proliferation. Both
measures have the same objective - to protect the world from offensive
missiles. But missile non-proliferation instruments are available today,
if only they will be used with greater determination.

#### China is currently exporting drones all over the world, they did this even when the US was compliant with the MTCR. This proves that the MTCR has no influence on non-members on the case of drones.

In Drones In The Middle East,\" Forbes,

[Armed drones have become an increasingly common sight in the skies
around the Middle East in recent years,]{.underline} notably in the war
zones of Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen. But rather than the most advanced
Western technology being used**[, it is a combination of Chinese imports
and home-grown alternatives that are being deployed by local armed
forces]{.underline}**. [The U.S. is the global leader in terms of
military drone technology but it has tough rules about which countries
can buy them. That has forced Middle East governments to either develop
their own or look for other potential sources -- and it is China that
has taken advantage.]{.underline} That is partly due to the relatively
low price of its drones, but also its willingness to sell to any
government that comes calling. **[Beijing's approach to drone sales was
characterized as one of "no questions asked"]{.underline}** in a
[paper](https://drones.rusi.org/) released by the Royal United Services
Institute (RUSI), a defence think-tank, in London on December 17.
**[Even countries that have traditionally favored Western military
equipment have been turning to Beijing, after being rebuffed by
Washington]{.underline}**. For example, when Jordan's request to buy
unarmed Predator XP drones from the U.S. was turned down in 2015 it
looked east, buying two CH-4Bs drones from China Aerospace Science &
Technology Corporation (CASC) the following year. Similar episodes have
played out in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey. [When Iraq was
refused permission to buy MQ-1 or MQ-9 drones from the U.S. it invested
in at least three CH-4Bs from China]{.underline}. It has since used them
on several hundred missions against Islamic State forces[. Saudi Arabia
and the UAE have also both bought Chinese drones]{.underline}. According
to RUSI, in 2014 Saudi Arabia bought two CH-4s from CASC and five larger
and deadlier Wing Loong IIs manufactured by Chengdu Aircraft Industry
Group (CAIG). Riyadh has used its drones in Yemen, with some of them
stationed at the Sharurah and Jizan airbases near the border. However,
most drone strikes in Yemen are thought to have been carried out by the
U.S. or the UAE. Some of these drones have been lost in the conflict. A
CH-4 crashed in Yemen in August 2018 and another drone was lost the
following month -- although it is not clear if they were Saudi or UAE
aircraft. The UAE's drone fleet includes Wing Loongs and Wing Loong IIs
from CAIG, which Abu Dhabi started to buy after the U.S. refused to
supply American-made armed drones. As well as Yemen, the UAE appears to
have [deployed its armed drones in
Libya](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security/covert-emirati-support-gave-east-libyan-air-power-key-boost-u-n-report-idUSKBN1902K0)
in support for Khalifa Haftar's forces and in breach of the
international arms embargo on the country, according to a UN Panel of
Experts report. Home-grown drones When Turkey was denied access to armed
MQ-1 Predator drones from the U.S. in 2008, they first turned to Israel
and bought unarmed Heron TPs. But in more recent years[, Ankara has been
pushing the development of a domestic drone industry]{.underline}. So
far Turkey has developed two armed drones: the Anka-S from Turkish
Aerospace Industries and the Bayraktar TB2 made by Kale-Bayker. A third
model, the Karayel, developed by Vestel Defence Industry is thought to
be in the testing phase. The Bayraktar TB2 has been used for strikes
against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkey as well as in
Kurdish areas of neighboring Syria**[. A number of other countries have
been developing their own drone manufacturing capability and here too
China is at times playing a role. In 2017, Saudi Arabia signed a
[licensing
deal](https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2017-04-12/saudi-arabia-buying-and-building-chinese-armed-drones)
with CASC to manufacture its drones in the kingdom]{.underline}**.
**[The largest regional operator of drones is Israel]{.underline}**.
Most of the time it uses the unmanned aircraft for intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance. However, it has at least three types of
armed drone which have been used to conduct strikes in Gaza and possibly
in Egypt, Lebanon, Sudan and Syria too. They are the Heron TP made by
Israel Aerospace Industries, and the Hermes 450 and the Hermes 900, both
made by Elbit Systems. Israel is also the most active exporter from the
region, having delivered 165 drones to customers over the past three
decades, according to RUSI. However, with the exception of those sales
to Turkey, all have gone outside the region. Another country which has
developed significant capabilities in drone manufacturing is Iran, which
has had to do so while being largely cut off from international
suppliers. As well as a number of unarmed drones, there are two
Iranian-made armed UAVs: the Shahed-129, built by Shahed Aviation
Industries, and the more recently unveiled Mohajer 6, produced by Ghods
UAV Industries. [The design of the Shahed-129 closely resembles Israel's
Hermes 450, which suggests Iran may have had access to that aircraft,
possibly reverse engineering one that was lost on a covert
mission]{.underline}. For Iran, drones fit in well with its doctrine of
asymmetric warfare, which it has developed to compensate for the limited
abilities of its conventional forces compared to those of its opponents.
Future proliferation In terms of overall numbers, drones still make up
only a small element of the Middle East countries' arsenals. According
to RUSI**[, the seven countries covered by its report have built between
128 and 174 drones and have imported an estimated 23 drones from
China.]{.underline}** However**[, in the future they are likely to
become a more significant tool for both surveillance and conducting
strikes.]{.underline}** One indication of the potential scale of
operations in the future is the fact that Saudi Arabia has a deal to buy
300 Wing Loong drones from CAIG. "[The proliferation is likely to
continue]{.underline}," said Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a research fellow
at RUSI and co-author of its report. As drones become more common,
developing defences to tackle them will also become more important. A
delegation of UAE officials visited French and Finnish companies that
manufacture anti-drone systems during the summer[. [Ukrainian
companies](https://archive.crossborderinformation.com/Article/UAE%2fRegion+Ukraine+taps+new+Gulf+markets.aspx?date=20170908&docNo=16&qid=2&page=2)
have also been eyeing up the potential to sell anti-drone technology to
the region]{.underline}. And in June, Australia's DroneShield reported
that an unnamed Middle East country had placed a \$3.2m order for 70 of
its droneguns, which are designed to disable hostile drones, with
further orders "in the pipeline." **[With the market shifting away from
it, the U.S. has shown signs of changing its approach and relaxing its
rules. In April, the State Department unveiled a [new
policy](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280619.htm) on the
export of unmanned aerial systems which it said would remove barriers to
the global market "and avoid ceding export opportunities to competitors
where such self-imposed restrictions are unwarranted." To date, however,
that hasn't led to any reported sales to the Middle East]{.underline}**.
**[If they are able to switch suppliers and buy American in the future,
it is likely that many Middle East governments will do
so.]{.underline}** At the moment Western countries including the U.S.
and U.K. do not allow their systems to be integrated with Chinese
technology, including its drones. That undermines the Chinese drones'
utility to the likes of the UAE and Saudi Arabia which have air forces
based around Western aircraft. While governments continue to build up
their capabilities, the greatest use of drones in and around the region
to date has been by outside forces. In particular, the U.S. has used
them widely in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia for many years. According to
one [recent
report](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-ramped-up-drone-strikes-in-americas-shadow-wars),
President Donald Trump's administration launched 238 drone strikes in
these three countries in 2017 and 2018.

#### China has been and will continue to sell drones around the world, violating the MTCR

Jakob **Reimann**, 2-18-**2019**, \"China is Flooding the Middle East
With Cheap Drones,\" Foreign Policy In Focus,
https://fpif.org/china-is-flooding-the-middle-east-with-cheap-drones/

[The last great revolution on the world's battlefields began with the
advent of the drone era.]{.underline} Particularly in the Middle East,
the drone became the symbol of the U.S. empire operating in a legal
vacuum. In the first decade and a half of the "War on Terror," the U.S.
still had a virtual monopoly on the risk-free execution from thousands
of meters above --- but **[once the genie is out of the bottle, every
attempt to squeeze it back in is notoriously doomed to
failure.]{.underline}** And so, [quickly other countries in the region
aspired after the financially --- and politically --- cheap execution by
drone]{.underline}. **[The number of armies with their own drone fleet
is growing rapidly]{.underline}**. [[A multi-billion-dollar
market](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2017/05/03/global-drone-market-expected-to-surpass-22b-by-2022/)
with astronomical growth rates opened up --- demand that's essentially
served only by one actor: China.]{.underline} The appearance of [the
Rainbow CH-4 --- the driving force of Chinese combat drones --- is
[almost
identical](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a22101/chinas-ch-4b-drone-looks-awfully-familiar/)
to the notorious Reaper drone of the U.S. arms manufacturer General
Atomics]{.underline}. While the CH-4 [lags
behind](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/)
the Reaper in most performance parameters, it can keep up with or even
outperform its competitor in some of them. Also, the CH-4's weaponry,
[the AKD-10
warhead](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/),
is almost identical to the Reaper's Hellfire missiles. The striking
similarity follows a strategy of Chinese engineering well-known from
cell phones or cars: the look of a world-famous Western branded product
is copied with an inferior but sufficiently good quality compared to
that of the original --- but at significantly less cost. **[Chinese
drones are 50 to 75 percent cheaper than the originals from the
U.S.]{.underline}** A late 2015 article published in the Asia Times
suggests that this copying of U.S. technology is likely rooted in
Beijing's data theft. According to records by world-famous NSA
whistleblower Edward Snowden, by 2010 alone "Chinese hackers had
conducted [more than 30,000 cyber
attacks](http://www.atimes.com/chinas-armed-drones-appear-built-from-stolen-data-from-us-cyber-intrusions/)"
on Pentagon computer networks and other U.S. military agencies in order
to "exfiltrate \[data on\] sensitive military technology." Although
there is no final proof that data on drones were skimmed off too, Asia
Times quotes then NSA director Gen. Keith Alexander, who suggests that
it is highly likely that the Reaper blueprints were part of the Chinese
data hack, while military experts and analysts largely share this view.
With the latest model --- the CH-7, which is still in the development
phase --- **[China could possibly pull ahead the U.S. for the first
time]{.underline}**, military journal [Defense One
explains](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2018/11/chinas-beating-us-market-combat-drones-copying-us-technology/152625/).
The CH-7 "will be the sole option for buyers wanting to field stealth
combat drones," it predicts. "The United States had a decade-plus head
start on \[drone\] technology," says military expert Paul Scharre, "and
has unfortunately squandered that lead." [For a long time, it was only
the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel that had combat drones
and used them to execute alleged terrorists --- something that has
changed dramatically in recent years.]{.underline} Meanwhile, the number
of countries with combat drones has swelled to [at least
29](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/world-of-drones/3-who-has-what-countries-armed-drones/),
as research organization New America identifies. And 10
[countries](https://www.newamerica.org/in-depth/world-of-drones/2-who-has-what-countries-drones-used-combat/)
have demonstrably used them to kill suspected enemies; in addition to
the three mentioned, there is Iran, Azerbaijan, the UAE, as well as
Nigeria, Iraq, Pakistan, and Turkey (the last four countries
drone-killed people on their own soil). Historically, **[Israel is the
largest drone exporter, with a [market share of over 60
percent](https://drones.rusi.org/countries/israel/) in the last three
decades]{.underline}**. More recently, from 2008-2017, China exported a
total of [88 drones to at least 12
countries](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/),
ranking third among the world's drone exporters behind the United States
(351) and Israel (186). However, [while the vast majority of U.S. and
Israeli exports are made up of unarmed reconnaissance drones, China's
sales focus on armed drones]{.underline}. During the mentioned period,
China exported 68 combat drones, putting it ahead of the U.S. (62) and
Israel (56). Foreign Policy thus recently titled rightly: "[China Has
Already Won the Drone
Wars](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/10/china-trump-middle-east-drone-wars/)."
All of the armed forces of the Chinese military have [large fleets of
various
drones](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2161354/drones-have-become-part-chinas-military-strategy),
but Beijing has used them so far only for disaster relief, surveillance
of domestic critics, and military reconnaissance --- not to kill. (In
2013, Beijing considered executing by drone a [Myanmar drug
baron](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/world/asia/chinese-plan-to-use-drone-highlights-military-advances.html)
wanted in the murders of 13 Chinese sailors, but eventually caught and
tried him.) Rather, Beijing appears to be establishing a norm
permanently prohibiting lethal drone strikes in East and South Asia.
However, **[this no-shoot dogma does not prevent the Chinese arms
industry from exporting their drones to states that are patently using
them for killing elsewhere.]{.underline}** While the Pentagon continues
to this day to deliver armed Reaper drones only to the UK, France, and
Italy, purchasers of Chinese combat drones, [according to Chinese
manufacturers](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/10/china-trump-middle-east-drone-wars/),
include Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Jordan, Myanmar, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, the UAE, and Zambia. So far, [the
three largest buyers of Chinese
drones](https://chinapower.csis.org/china-drones-unmanned-technology/)
are Pakistan (with a share of 25 percent) as well as Egypt and Myanmar
(with 23 and 13 percent, respectively). Several of Beijing's buyers are
close strategic U.S. allies who have requested the sale of armed drones
from Washington to no avail and have thus fallen back on Chinese
products. The U.S. is by far the largest arms exporter and usually sells
military equipment to almost every country in the world. [According to
the SIPRI research
institute](http://justicenow.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/SIPRI_Arms-Export-USA_2007-2017.xlsx),
the U.S. sold \$98 billion worth of weapons to as many as 112 countries
in 2007-2017. Hence, on the face of it, it seems rather counterintuitive
that it would hand over the lucrative battle drone market to China. [A
recent report by the
DIA](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/pentagon-mideast-turning-china-drone-needs.html),
the Pentagon's internal intelligence service, deals with this
contradiction. "China is a niche provider of armed \[drones\]" in the
Middle East, the report acknowledges, and correctly concludes that
"China faces little competition" as it is not a member of international
export control regimes. In fact, unlike the U.S. and the European
arms-exporting countries, China is not a contracting party to the
[Missile Technology Control
Regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Technology_Control_Regime#Members)
(MTRC), which strictly regulates the proliferation of combat drones and
makes U.S. drone exports to the Middle East more difficult. In addition
to attempts by the Trump administration to amend the MTRC, Trump's State
Department published a [new export
policy](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280619.htm) in April
2018: "We will remove barriers to the global \[drone\] market and avoid
ceding export opportunities to competitors where such self-imposed
restrictions are unwarranted." Since the wording does not specify when
restrictions are "unwarranted," the new policy can be understood as
blank approval for future drone exports. De facto, it was also made
possible to buy combat drones directly from the manufacturer, [without
the government as a broker
agent](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/06/trump-push-to-boost-lethal-drone-exports-reaps-few-rewards-uas-mtcr/).
"To date, however, that hasn't led to any reported sales to the Middle
East," Forbes
[reported](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/12/17/china-fueling-drones-arms-race-middle-east/)
late last year. So**[, in contrast to relatively strict regulations on
U.S. drone exports, China's "[no questions
asked](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/12/17/china-fueling-drones-arms-race-middle-east/)"
policy allowed it to quickly gain a foothold in the lucrative Middle
East drone market and aggressively expand the course of the
proliferation of cheap drones.]{.underline}** State-of-the-art
technology perceived as revolutionary always comes with a certain
adulation for its possessor. Thus, a recent report by London-based
military think tank RUSI concludes that "[national prestige and
status](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/drones-1687746893) is the
main reason that most states" in the Middle East increasingly acquire
drones, as Middle East Eye reports. However, in addition to their value
as status symbols, in recent years they are more and more being used
strategically [on the battlefields of the
region](https://www.voanews.com/a/report-china-driving-use-of-armed-drones-in-middle-east/4704022.html),
which the RUSI report attributes largely to increased Chinese exports.
And so Chinese drones also recorded their first deaths: Besides fatal
deployment by the [Nigerian
army](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/10/03/chinese-armed-drones-now-flying-over-mideast-battlefields-heres-why-theyre-gaining-on-us-drones/)against
Boko Haram, since the end of 2015, the Iraqi military performed more
than [260 air
strikes](http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/chinas-drones-are-taking-isis-heres-why-america-should-worry-24581)against
Islamic State targets with Chinese drones. They gained particular infamy
on April 22 last year, when the UAE [executed the de facto president of
Yemen](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/),
Saleh Ali al-Sammad, with a Chinese drone, escalating the nearly
four-year war in the country. The murdered Al-Sammad was seen as a
promoter of the UN-mediated peace process in Yemen, whereas his
successor, Mahdi al-Mashat, is an implacable, uncompromising hardliner
and provocateur. Of particular concern is China's drone policy in Saudi
Arabia. [A \$ 65 billion economic program clinched between the two
countries in spring 2017 includes the construction of a [Chinese drone
factory in Saudi
Arabia](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2081869/chinese-drone-factory-saudi-arabia-first-middle-east)
--- the first of its kind in the region.]{.underline} Initially, the
license production of [300
drones](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/drones-1687746893) was
agreed, which represents a massive figure given the 88 drones that China
has exported in the last decade altogether. However, the license drones
are not exclusively intended for the Saudi Royal Air Force --- Riyadh
can explicitly [market them to other
countries](https://www.israeldefense.co.il/en/node/29253) in the region.
End-user certificates do not exist for deals with Beijing. In view of
the fact that Saudi Arabia, along with supporting various jihadist
groups in the region, is [a close ally of Al Qaeda in
Yemen](http://justicenow.de/2018-03-18/des-westen-als-treuer-verbuendeter-der-al-qaida/),
it is within the realm of possibility to envision some of these drones
end up in terrorist's hands. Fueled by Beijing's export policy, the
threat scenario of drone-armed jihadists has moved significantly closer.
Research by the Jamestown Foundation shows that we have already entered
the era of "[unmanned
terrorism](https://jamestown.org/program/entering-era-unmanned-terrorism/)."
Groups commonly labelled as "terrorists" from Syria, Iraq, and
Afghanistan to Gaza, Lebanon, and Yemen are already using mini-drones to
drop bombs, grenades, and incendiary devices onto enemy positions or
civilian facilities. Further flooding the region with cheap combat
drones from China will certainly heave these tactics to the next level
in the future. Since 2001, thousands of people, most of them civilians,
have been killed by drone in the so-called "War on Terror," changing the
nature of war in its entirety and exposing civilians in all these
undeclared war zones to a permanent threat on their lives. Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Barack Obama proved he could always escape punishment and
international condemnation even after using drones to [turn weddings and
funerals into blood baths and mass
graves](https://roarmag.org/essays/obama-legacy-war-conflict-peace/).
And so, the desires of local actors to acquire these practical killing
tools were aroused, too. **[The Chinese leadership is exploiting these
developments without compromise and flooding the Middle East with cheap
drones. The consequences of this expansionary policy cannot be
foreseen.]{.underline}** Pandora's box is already open.

#### **MTCR is an informal non-binding agreement**

**United States Department of State 17,** G-7 17, 1-20-2017, \"Missile
Technology Control Regime (MTCR) Frequently Asked Questions,\" United
States Department of State,
https://www.state.gov/remarks-and-releases-bureau-of-international-security-and-nonproliferation/missile-technology-control-regime-mtcr-frequently-asked-questions/

What is the relationship between the MTCR and the UN? While there is no
formal linkage, the activities of the MTCR are consistent with the UN's
non-proliferation and export control efforts. For example, applying the
MTCR Guidelines and Annex on a national basis helps countries to meet
their export control obligations under UN Security Council Resolution
1540. 6. Is the MTCR a treaty? No. **[The MTCR is not a treaty and does
not impose any legally binding obligations on Partners (members).
Rather, it is an informal political understanding]{.underline}** among
states that seek to limit the proliferation of missiles and missile
technology.

#### MTCR is ineffective and fails to take action- previous instances prove 

#### **International Relations Insights & Analysis 14. ("Analyzing the Effectiveness of Missile Technology Control Regime ." International Relations Insights & Analysis , 2014, www.ir-ia.com/reports/IRIA-Analyzing the-Effectiveness-of-Missile-Technology-Control-Regime.pdf.)**

Just two **[weeks after the MTCR established in 1987, Iraq conducted its
first successful flight test of extended-range ballistic
missile.]{.underline}** Later Israel conducted its \"The Jericho II\"
missile test in 1987, 1988 and 1989, during the same time India also
conducted its own missile tests (Prithvi in 1988 and Agni in 1989), the
course was followed by Pakistan\'s Hatf II missile test in 1989, and
then North Korea\'s the Nodong in 1993. In late 80s and early 90s, China
also transferred its CSS-2 missiles to Saudi Arabia and M-9 and M-11
missiles to Pakistan. MTCR was facing serious challenges and was unable
to tackle the situation. **[Even the most enthusiastic supporters of
MTCR acknowledged that not only did the MTCR fail to slow down the
missile programs of India, Iran, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan but
may have in fact provided an incentive]{.underline}** for weakening
domestic support to their indigenous programs. The case of Iran reveals
one of the major failures of MTCR. Even after joining the regime, Russia
continued to supply advanced technology, components, and personnel to
Iran for its missile program. Despite clear evidence of Russian
violations of the MTCR, the United States as well as other member states
failed to invoke the sanctions against Russia for violations or to
restrain the proliferation. MTCR met another failure, when China
supplied missile-related technology to Iran. **[Although Chinese
government pledged to accept the regulations of MTCR, yet the violations
and transfer of missile technology have continued, and MTCR failed to
take action against China or impose sanctions. Consequently, the Iranian
missile program progressed rapidly and Iran enhanced its capabilities
for developing and producing local long-range missiles]{.underline}**.9
Despite the regimes' limitations and incapability to restrain India,
Iran, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan to develop their missile
programs, the MTCR has shown some progress in slowing down or stopping
several ballistic missile programs. According to the Arms Control
Association, "Argentina, Egypt, and Iraq abandoned their joint Condor II
ballistic missile program. Brazil, South Africa, and Taiwan also shelved
or eliminated missile or space launch vehicle programs. Some Eastern
European countries, such as Poland and the Czech Republic, destroyed
their ballistic missiles, including some Soviet-era Scuds, in part, to
better their chances of joining MTCR in 1993."10 When Iraq conducted its
first flight test \"Al-Hussein\", their missile program was heavily
dependent on foreign procurement and, hence, it was vulnerable to a
supply cut-off. Although, Iraqis were able to develop Al-Hussein, but
due to MTCR efforts, and limitations Iraq was unable to achieve its
ultimate missile objective. Disarmament of Argentina\'s Condor II
project, the cancellation of two Brazilian systems (Avibras\'s SS series
and Orbita\'s MB series), delaying India\'s missile program, delaying
China\'s sales of M-9 and M-11 missiles to Pakistan and encouraging
Germany to improve its export control enforcement legislation are
considered to be great achievements by MTCR. So it appears that the MTCR
played a decisive role in reducing ballistic missile programs capable of
delivering nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons in some non-MTCR
countries. Although some of the countries such as Egypt, Iraq, and Syria
have given up their ballistic missile programs capable of delivering
chemical and biological weapons, but they are still believed to be
seeking to acquire these weapons through other means. On the other
hand**[, India, Pakistan, Iran, North Korea and Israel with varying
degrees of foreign assistance, have been continuously deploying
medium-range ballistic missiles with more than 1,000 kilometers range.
Some of the MTCR non-member countries are also transferring their
missile technology to other countries. North Korea is considered as the
primary source of ballistic missile proliferation. Iran has supplied
missile technology to Syria.]{.underline}** Sometimes **[events such as
these put a question mark in the effectiveness of the
MTCR.]{.underline}** At the same time, some non-member countries also
believe that Missile Technology Control Regime is sometimes used to
benefit its founding members, and globalize their agendas.

#### MTCR has been grossly unsuccessful and is likely to only get worse

#### International Relations Insights & Analysis 14**. ("Analyzing the Effectiveness of Missile Technology Control Regime ." International Relations Insights & Analysis , 2014, www.ir-ia.com/reports/IRIA-Analyzing the-Effectiveness-of-Missile-Technology-Control-Regime.pdf.)**

At the same time, MTCR is often being criticized by the observers for
being an exclusive club and serving the interests of some major powers,
especially the United States. The Missile Technology Control Regime has
definitely slowed down or delayed the proliferation process of nuclear
and missile technology, and reduced the rate and size of the flow.
Nevertheless **[the Regime clearly failed to accomplish its stated goal,
which is to stop the proliferation of missile and nuclear technology,
especially to the instable and chaotic regions. As more and more
countries successfully developing and advancing their missile programmes
with foreign assistance, the MTCR might face serious challenges in the
years to come. The Regime also lacks the required regulatory framework
to check the development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). At the same
time, many other non-member states have continuously remained involved
in selling and transferring missile technology to other countries. Due
to the lack of regulatory structure and its voluntary nature, the MTCR
cannot mandate any forceful action against member countries violating
its guidelines. With rapidly increasing threat of the missile technology
proliferation]{.underline}**, The MTCR urgently needs to improve its
mechanism and equip IRIA Report No. 4 Analyzing the Effectiveness of
Missile Technology Control Regime 9 itself to address all the concerns
and tackle new challenges.

#### The number of nations that are in MTCR make finding a consensus difficult, incentivizing countries to break the rules

**Beck 17,** Michael. (Executive Director, Center for International
Trade and Security**"** Creating a New Multilateral Export Control
Regime". 2017,
mail.pircenter.org/media/content/files/10/13539385870.pdf.)

**[There are several problems that are facing each of the export control
regimes]{.underline}** and their members efforts to coordinate export
controls: •**[Growing number of members]{.underline}**. This would seem
to be a positive development. However, member countries **[do not always
agree on the nature of the threat.]{.underline}** Moreover, all of these
regimes take decisions on the basis of consensus. When there where 7
members of the MTCR, it was relatively easy to reach a consensus.
However, **[when there are]{.underline}** more than thirty members
**[consensus becomes difficult to obtain]{.underline}**. Simply put, the
growth of the regimes was not well thought out and needs to be
revisited. There are even organizational problems associated with
membership growth - finding space large enough to host a plenary of say
the NSG. •With growth in membership - **[consensus decision making needs
to give way to new more democratic decision rules. For years, Russia
stalled efforts within the Wassenaar to control MANPADS. Russia is
continuing to block efforts to control small arms and light weapons
within Wassenaar. It is not really acceptable for one nation, whether it
is the U.S., Russia, or Slovenia or Poland to block the emergence of new
international norms. •While growth in membership is a problem - the lack
of participation in multilateral control efforts by major supplier and
weapons states like India, Pakistan, and China poses a serious problem.
What obligations do these countries have, if any, to control dual-use
items? This inability to guarantee responsible behavior on the part of
countries not party to these regimes, is in part, an explanation for the
rise of a counterproliferation regime as witnessed with the
Proliferation Security Initiative]{.underline}**. •Another problem stems
from the inadequate level of information sharing within the regimes.
Although some regimes have agreed to share information on denials, not
all member countries willingly share that information. The GAO in the
United States reported that the United States did not report any of 27
Australia Group-related denials between 1996-2001. Some countries argue
that they do not issue denials, but instead inform exporters that they
are unlikely to get a license if they apply. These "de-facto" denials
never enter the system. Further efforts to share information on export
approvals - which is essential for determining technology transfer
trends of concerns, or violations of the no-undercut provisions embodied
in the regimes have not gone forward. •**[Finally, some countries are
very slow to implement decisions reached within the regimes into
national legislation. Others don't implement decisions at all. Because
decisions are implemented on the basis of national-discretion, there are
no real consequences for governments that fail to implement agreed upon
controls.]{.underline}** •In addition to internal problems - there are
external problems as well. The increased pace of global trade.
Controlling exports of emerging dual-use technologies today requires
foresight and the ability to juggle competing demands. Officials must
keep pace not only with technologies that pose a threat today, but also
with technological innovations that might be militarily-relevant
tomorrow. •Terrorism. Export Control authorities must give more

originated in Afghanistan, not in Iraq or Iran. We need to be concerned
about failed states and gray zones, because these are breeding grounds
for terrorism, and such governments cannot be trusted to control
dangerous technology.

#### There are no consequences for not complying to the regulations of MTCR

**Arieh 99** (Stav, xx, xx-xx-xxxx, \"THE FAILURE OF THE MTCR IN THE
MIDDLE EAST,\"1999 No Publication,
http://archive.geraldsteinberg.com/barilanwebsite/conflict/armspapers/mtcr.htm)

In the past decades, supplier controls have become the first line of
defense in the effort to block the proliferation of non-conventional
weapons, including ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction.
The first steps in this direction were taken in the 1970s, with the
first elements in what later became the Nuclear Supplier's Group (also
known as the London group), and later expanded to include similar
arrangements with respect to chemical weapons (the Australia Group). In
parallel, the United States Congress enacted a series of unilateral
export control limitations, with sanctions for violations of these
controls. With respect to missile proliferation, **[the Missile
Technology Control Regime constitutes a "voluntary nonproliferation
arrangement", as it is described in a recent Pentagon
report]{.underline}**.[\[3\]](http://archive.geraldsteinberg.com/barilanwebsite/conflict/armspapers/mtcr.htm#_edn3)
In the early 1970s, the proliferation of ballistic missiles began to be
seen as a major threat to global as well as regional stability and
security. Although weapons of mass destruction can be delivered by a
number of systems, including conventional aircraft, surface vehicles,
and naval vessels, ballistic missile provide greater range, traverse
large distances much more quickly, and, in contrast to the other
delivery systems, there are, as yet, no effective defenses against
ballistic missiles. As US government officials noted, the "speed and
surprise" that can be achieved with missiles were "far greater than that
achievable with manned
aircraft."[\[4\]](http://archive.geraldsteinberg.com/barilanwebsite/conflict/armspapers/mtcr.htm#_edn4)
During the late 1970s, the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
sponsored the initial examination of policy options, and these later
became the basis for negotiations between the Reagan Administration and
the other members of the G-7 (the group of seven major industrial
states).[\[5\]](http://archive.geraldsteinberg.com/barilanwebsite/conflict/armspapers/mtcr.htm#_edn5)
In 1987, these negotiations resulted in what is official terms a
"non-binding voluntary arrangement" **[that is "designed to limit the
risk of nuclear proliferation by controlling the transfer of equipment
and technology that could contribute to the development and production
of nuclear-capable, unmanned delivery
systems."]{.underline}****[[\[6\]](http://archive.geraldsteinberg.com/barilanwebsite/conflict/armspapers/mtcr.htm#_edn6)
Under its original terms, the MTCR covered missiles capable of
delivering a payload of 500 kilograms or more to distances of or greater
than 300 kilometers. These parameters reflected the minimum weight of an
unsophisticated nuclear warhead, and the "strategic distances in the
most compact theaters where nuclear-armed missile might be
used."]{.underline}****[[\[7\]](http://archive.geraldsteinberg.com/barilanwebsite/conflict/armspapers/mtcr.htm#_edn7)]{.underline}**
In the Middle East, these distances, and even smaller ranges, are indeed
of strategic significance, and missiles or other means of delivery with
ranges of under 300 kilometers are classified as strategic systems. As
noted, the MTCR was initially prompted by American concerns regarding
the potential for missile proliferation among the pariah states in the
Middle East, such as Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya. The initial MTCR
arrangement included an annex consisting of two categories which
attempted to specify those technologies to be controlled, based on
equipment and materials "relevant to missile development, production and
operation."[\[8\]](http://archive.geraldsteinberg.com/barilanwebsite/conflict/armspapers/mtcr.htm#_edn8)
Under Category I, those items that were directly and clearly related to
rapid missile proliferation were included, as well as related production
facilities for these
systems.[\[9\]](http://archive.geraldsteinberg.com/barilanwebsite/conflict/armspapers/mtcr.htm#_edn9)Category
II consisted of "dual-use" technologies, whose application to missile
production was
possible.[\[10\]](http://archive.geraldsteinberg.com/barilanwebsite/conflict/armspapers/mtcr.htm#_edn10)
The proliferation of chemical and biological capabilities led to
increased concern regarding the potential use of ballistic missiles for
delivering CBW, and in 1993, the MTCR limits were extended to cover
delivery systems for all forms of weapons of mass destruction. In
addition, the detailed listing of prohibited technologies was
supplemented by an agreement that members would base their policies on a
"strong presumption" to deny an export request if the technology in
question is "intended" for use in a system to deliver weapons of mass
destruction. Since chemical and biological warheads would be effective
in missiles with shorter ranges and smaller payloads, this meant that
additional systems below the initial 500 kg., 300 km limits were now
formally included in the MTCR controls. In addition, the extended
definition went beyond ballistic missiles to include remotely-piloted
vehicles and other potential delivery systems for non-conventional
weapons.

#### Lack of enforceability creates tensions between developing countries and developed countries- rendering MTCR uneffective 

**Yuan 2000,**( Jing-dong. "The MTCR and Missile Proliferation: Moving
Toward the Next Phase." International Security Research and Outreach
Programme International Security Bureau, May
200AD,www.international.gc.ca/armsarmes/assets/pdfs/yuan2000.pdf)

These new developments highlight the challenges that **[the MTCR faces
and the institutional deficiencies that hinder adequate responses on the
part of the regime]{.underline}**. The MTCR has certainly made serious
efforts over the years to adjust itself to the new challenges. These
efforts include regime enhancement through membership expansion, further
institutionalization through the establishment of a point of contact and
clearinghouse in Paris; the strengthening of both the Guidelines and
member states' national export control systems; and the negotiation of
adherence on the part of non-regime suppliers to the MTCR's
guidelines.47 **[However, the regime's institutional deficiencies impede
further progress. These deficiencies include: • a lack of norms and a
legally binding treaty status; • differing national interpretations
concerning guideline enforcement measures; • conflicts between trade
liberalization and export controls in national policies; and • uneven
development of national export control systems. The first problem is
that the MTCR is not a legally binding international treaty, and that
there is lack of consensus concerning the control of missiles. This has
led to tensions regarding the regime's export control arrangements,
especially between the northern industrialized countries and their
southern developing counterparts.]{.underline}**48 Unlike nuclear
weapons and chemical/biological weapons, where strong consensus exists
concerning nonproliferation, there is less agreement concerning the
subject of missile transfers. Indeed, there is increasing dispute over
where to draw the line between acceptable activities (which would
certainly include civilian space launches) and unacceptable ones (for
example, where does one draw the line between "good" and "bad" national
military development and testing programs). No international mechanism
exists to make such determinations, and the MTCR is hardly adequate to
handle this matter. Moreover, when compared with such relatively more
developed regimes as the Non-proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons
Convention, the Nuclear Suppliers Group and the Australia Group, the
MTCR lacks a mechanism to ensure consistent interpretation and
enforcement.49 Related to this inherent weakness is the tendency for
differing interpretations and implementation of guidelines. **[Without
uniform and consistent execution, export controls across national
governments have turned out to be varied and uneven, leaving many
loopholes for proliferate states. Even if agreements can be made at the
multilateral level, controls must ultimately be carried out at the
national level. Here the perspectives and policies of major supplier
states, and the diversity and complexity of domestic politics and
processes whereby national export control policies are formulated and
implemented will all have a huge impact on the success of
nonproliferation endeavors.]{.underline}**50

#### MTCR is unsuccessful at stopping proliferation

**Jones 17** (Scott. "Transcending the MTCR: the Current & Future
Missile Control Regime." University of Georgia, 2 Nov. 2017,
www.mofa.go.kr/www/brd/m_3989/down.do?brd_id=95&seq\...data\...)

Still, the **[MTCR]{.underline}** has not proven to be a panacea. The
regime **[suffers from leakage of technology, inconsistent
interpretations of the guidelines, and from the growing problem of
secondary and tertiary proliferation]{.underline}**. It is important to
stress, however, that the MTCR is only one of several "nonproliferation"
tools the United States can use to counter missile export activities.
The current trend is toward a de facto multilateral missile
nonproliferation standard observed even by some non-members of the MTCR,
such as the recent EU-led Hague Code of Conduct on Missile Proliferation
and the Russian effort to create a Global Control System (GCS).[^1] Some
non-member interdictions of transfers violated UN sanctions against Iraq
and should have been blocked even in the absence of MTCR. However, the
UN missile sanctions against Iraq are based on the technical structure
of the MTCR. Internal and External Challenges The continuing ability of
the MTCR to stem missile proliferation is compromised by a host of
internal and external challenges. This section itemizes both the
external and obstructions. The subsequent section concludes with an
examination of options for strengthening the MTCR. External The threat
of ballistic missile proliferation has been dramatically highlighted
over the past few years by a growing number of countries that have
tested short- to intermediate-range ballistic missiles. These include
India's Agni-1 and Agni-2; Pakistan's Ghauri-1, Ghauri-2, and Shaheen;
North Korea's Taepo Dong-I; China's Dong Feng-31 ICBM, and Iran's
Shahab-3.[^2] Anxiety over North Korea's much anticipated launch test of
the Taepo-Dong-II has caused intense diplomatic and military
maneuvering.[^3] While the Berlin talks have led to an announced test
suspension by Pyongyang, the key elements of North Korean missile
programs, including the DPRK's continued development and sales, remain
unaddressed. Missile acquisition and developments efforts are also
occurring in other regions of tension and instability, such as the
Middle East, the Gulf, and South Asia. For example, Iran is developing
the Shahab-4, Pakistan is moving ahead with the Shaheen-II, and Syria
reportedly is acquiring Chinese M-9 missiles via Pakistan and North
Korea.[^4] Ongoing transfers of missile systems and related technologies
to other regions, in particular the highly contentious Gulf region and
the Middle East, remain a serious proliferation concern. China and North
Korea have over the years been charged with willingly supplying
missiles, missile components, and relevant technologies to Third World
customers. **[While China has pledged to abide by the MTCR guidelines
since 1992 (and indeed Beijing\'s records in this regard have improved
noticeably in recent years), there remain allegations that Chinese
missile components and technology continue to be transferred to such
countries as Pakistan and Iran]{.underline}**. A recently released U.S.
intelligence report charges that China may have transferred medium-range
missiles to Pakistan.[^5] Beijing has also had to contend with
allegations that it has provided assistance to Iran designed to improve
the latter\'s anti-ship missiles, thus **[violating a Chinese pledge to
the United States not to engage in such activities]{.underline}**.[^6]
North Korea also serves as a source of missile proliferation and is
reported to have played a prominent role in Pakistan's missile
development.[^7] Indian authorities have recently intercepted a North
Korean ship at Kandla port heading for Pakistan, with 177 crates of
blueprints, manuals and machine tools for Scud missiles.[^8] Pyongyang's
missile assistance and transfers to Iran are also a matter of
concern.[^9] The spread of ballistic missiles around the world was
greatly facilitated by the export in the 1970s and 1980s of Scud-B
missiles from the former Soviet Union. With an increasing number of
countries abiding by the MTCR, the number of potential missile suppliers
has declined dramatically. Of the principal missile exporters, only
North Korea has not agreed to comply. Moreover, additional countries
have learned to copy, modify, extend the range of, and produce their own
missiles, and a small number have developed long-range systems, often in
conjunction with space-launch programs and foreign technical assistance.
For example, Western countries assisted India's space launch vehicle
program in its early stages, and that provided the basis for its missile
program. Indeed, India's missile program traces its origins to the
U.S.-produced Scout Sounding Rocket.[^10] Western firms, especially in
Europe, provided technology for Argentina's Condor II missile program,
which was based on the U.S. Pershing II.[^11] Nevertheless, the majority
of ballistic missile proliferation involves Scud or Scud-derived
materials and technology.[^12] Even so,

### MTCR undermines US exports

#### The MTCR guidelines are too strict on member states -- that is undermining US exports 

**Congressional Research Service, 2-22**-19 (The Congressional Research
Service is a public policy think tank,
ttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/IF11069.pdf) (CB)

In March 2018, **[the United States submitted a proposal
to]{.underline}** the Missile Technology Control Regime (**[MTCR)
partners that would relax the regime's export guidelines for certain
Unmanned Aerial Systems]{.underline}** (UAS). **[Advocates of altering
the guidelines to ease such exports argue that increasing competition
from foreign UAS manufacturers is undermining the competitive advantage
of their U.S. counterparts]{.underline}**. Other observers have
emphasized the need to maintain the MTCR's standards, which are widely
regarded as effective. For more information on the MTCR, see CRS Report
RL33865, Arms Control and Nonproliferation: A Catalog of Treaties and
Agreements. **[Congress has frequently expressed interest in issues
concerning UAS development and use, as well as missile proliferation,
and also conducts oversight of U.S. UAS exports.]{.underline}** **[The
MTCR, according to its website, "seeks to limit the risks of
proliferation of" nuclear, biological, and chemical
weapons]{.underline}** (NBC weapons) "**[by controlling exports of goods
and technologies that could make a contribution to delivery
systems]{.underline}** (other than manned aircraft) for such weapons."
Established in 1987 by the United States and six other countries, the
MTCR, which holds several meetings per year and currently consists of 35
partner countries, is an informal voluntary arrangement whose partners
agree to apply common export policy guidelines to an annex containing
two categories of controlled items. Partner countries implement these
guidelines pursuant to national legislation and regularly exchange
information on relevant export licensing issues, including denials of
technology transfers. **[The MTCR guidelines apply to both armed and
unarmed UAS. According to the MTCR, Category I items are the most
sensitive and include complete UAS "capable of delivering a payload of
at least 500 kg to a range of at least 300 km, their major complete
subsystems ... and related software and technology,]{.underline}**" as
well as "specially designed" production facilities for these UAS and
subsystems. Partner governments should have "a strong presumption to
deny" such transfers, regardless of their purpose, but may transfer such
items on "rare occasions." **[The guidelines prohibit exports of
production facilities for Category I items]{.underline}**. Regime
partners have greater flexibility with respect to authorizing exports of
Category II items, which include less sensitive and dual-use missile
related components. This category also includes complete UAS, regardless
of payload, capable of ranges of at least 300 km, as well as other UAS
with certain characteristics. Details **[The proposal that the United
States submitted during the March 2018 MTCR]{.underline}** Technical
Experts **[Meeting would provide Category II treatment for a certain
subset of UAS with a "maximum speed value]{.underline}**," **[as well as
associated parts and components]{.underline}**, a Department of State
official told CRS on December 4. The official did not specify the
proposed speed value. **[The proposal also included a method for
determining the speed of such a UAS, a feature not contained in the
current MTCR annex, and a definition of "cruise missile]{.underline}**."
**[The proposed changes would not apply to cruise missiles or affect
current MTCR treatment of either complete production facilities or
technology for the development and production of complete
systems.]{.underline}** The proposed changes, which have not gained the
MTCR partners' required consensus approval, are a part of a broader
Trump Administration UAS export policy. Announced in April 2018, this
policy replaced a similar 2015 Obama Administration measure. An April
19, 2018, National Security Presidential Memorandum (NSPM) from
President Trump directed the Secretary of State to submit to the
President within 60 days a "proposed initiative to align" U.S. UAS
export policy "more closely with our national and economic security
interests." The initiative was to "address the status of, and recommend
next steps for, MTCR adoption of revised controls for MTCR Category I
UAS." According to the NSPM, the United States will continue its
"participation in and support for" the regime. The above-described March
2018 proposal's relationship to the NSPM is unclear.

### MTCR = big brother

#### The MTCR is allowing China and Iran to surpass us and sell drones to our allies now -- this leads to large scale surveillance states

Arthur **Herman**, **7-19**-2019 (Arthur, is an American [popular
historian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_historian), currently
serving as a senior fellow at [Hudson
Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Institute), "WSJ,

(CB)

**[The recent Iranian shootdown of an American RQ-4 Global Hawk
surveillance drone has underlined the escalating tension between U.S.
and Iran in the Persian Gulf]{.underline}**. **[It also shows how
ubiquitous and necessary unmanned aerial vehicles have become for
America's military missions]{.underline}**. Yet **[the U.S. may cede the
future of these large UAVs to competitors such as China, Russia and,
ironically, Iran, if we don't change how we develop and deploy these
systems.]{.underline}**

**[The media has trained Americans to think of military drones primarily
as tools for finding and killing terrorists]{.underline}**. In fact,
**[they handle a much broader range of missions, from gathering
intelligence and watching hot spots like the Strait of Hormuz to
monitoring weather patterns and disaster relief. These so-called
autonomous systems are quiet and relatively inconspicuous and can stay
aloft for 20 to 30 hours at a time. Given their growing
importance]{.underline}** **[for keeping the armed forces and
intelligence services informed 24/7]{.underline}**---and since similar
systems will soon become part of the U.S. commercial aircraft
fleet---almost every expert agrees they are the future of the aerospace
industry.

Yet **[thanks to]{.underline}** a single outdated provision of an
obscure international agreement formed in 1987---the Missile Technology
Control Regime, or **[MTCR]{.underline}**---**[the U.S. may lose
leadership to China and Iran of the large-drone market,]{.underline}**
**[which is expected to grow to \$32 billion in 10 years]{.underline}**.
**[The problem is that the treaty includes drones in the category of
missile technology capable of carrying a 500-kilogram payload at least
300 kilometers. MTCR signatories like the U.S. are forbidden to export
drones with that capacity, even to trusted allies.]{.underline}**

**[That restriction dates to 1992, when unmanned aircraft were
essentially target drones. The fear was that they'd be used for
kamikaze-style terrorist attacks]{.underline}**. That worry proved
unfounded. **[What it means today is that U.S. allies like South Korea
and Britain can't buy Global Hawks or Predators except through special
executive waiver, a time-consuming bureaucratic process.]{.underline}**

**[This means that good actors are denied the vast progress UAV
technology has made in]{.underline}** **[the U.S. since 1992, advances
that have made large drones faster, safer and more
versatile.]{.underline}**

**[China has stepped into the vacuum. Beijing isn't an MTCR signatory
and so is free to sell large drones
world-wide]{.underline}**---including to Egypt and the United Arab
Emirates after the U.S. had to turn down their requests for American
drones, thanks to the MTCR. **[The Chinese drones are based on
technology stolen from American companies, naturally.]{.underline}**

A January report from the Defense Intelligence Agency pointed out that
China has become a niche supplier of armed drones to putative American
allies, and noted that because of the MTCR, "China faces little
competition for sale of such systems."

**[Iran, also not an MTCR signatory, similarly sees an economic and
strategic opportunity in the large-drone market. It has been building
unmanned systems suitable for export---also based on stolen U.S.
technology---according to the Times of Israel.]{.underline}**

**[Export sales are essential to a robust made-in-America drone
industry, which will need to include commercial-aircraft as well as
defense systems. American companies and workers won't be the only losers
if the rules don't change. Human-rights critics often worry that the
U.S. military's reliance on drones will lead to a Big Brother-like
surveillance state that uses this technology for inhuman and tyrannical
ends. Leaving the drone market to China and Iran makes that outcome more
likely.]{.underline}**

### MTCR harms competitiveness

#### The MTCR is destroying the competitiveness of its member states

Relations at Oxford, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of International

(CB)

**[The United States' proposal to make an adjustment to the Missile
Technology Control Regim]{.underline}**e (MTCR) **[Annex as they relate
to unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has been the subject of detailed
discussion already in the MTCR for many months]{.underline}**, and the
MTCR's Technical Experts Meeting (TEM) has explored our proposal
extensively from a technical perspective. I would like to say a few
words about the reasons why we believe this modest reform of part of the
MTCR framework is both necessary today and an important part of keeping
the MTCR relevant and effective in the years ahead.

**[It almost goes without saying that the MTCR is]{.underline}** and
remains a **[valuable nonproliferation instrument]{.underline}**, and
one that we are committed to preserving --- but I will say so
nonetheless, for I wish there to be no misunderstanding about the U.S.
position. We have been steadfast proponents of the MTCR from its
beginning, and holding ourselves and international partners to its
standards of nonproliferation "best practice" is an important and
enduring aspect of our approach to nonproliferation and the preservation
of international peace and security against the destabilizing spread of
systems capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction (WMD). We
remain steadfast in our commitment to the MTCR.

Yet **[for all its accomplishments in slowing such proliferation and
helping underpin peace and security,]{.underline}** **[the MTCR is an
ageing regime. It and its Guidelines, in fact, are more than three
decades old. For a system setting standards of conduct that are based
upon highly specific technological parameters, this is in many ways an
extremely long time.]{.underline}**

**[As we consider what specific parameters should continue to be
enshrined in the MTCR in the years ahead, we must not forget just how
extraordinarily long a time this has been in technological terms. The
formulation of the MTCR, for instance, predated the invention of text
messaging, and its drafting preceded the introduction of the first crude
smart phone by more than a decade]{.underline}**. **[When our
predecessors were trying to figure out what technological standards
should be written into the MTCR framework people were still a few years
from figuring out how to distribute audio and video over the Internet,
the number of Internet websites in the entire world was in the low
hundreds, the first widespread computer virus had not yet appeared, and
the first permanent Internet connection between North America and Europe
had not yet been established]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[iconic modern
technology-driven or -facilitated firms that are now household
names]{.underline}** --- companies such as Amazon, Yahoo, Netflix, Ebay,
Facebook, Tesla, Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, Alibaba, and Baidu --- did not
exist.

So **[that was the technological environment of the time, and the world
was clearly a very different place]{.underline}**. But **[the world of
the MTCR's birth was also a vastly different place in economic terms.
China's per capita GDP was only a handful of hundreds of U.S.
dollars,]{.underline}** for instance, **[and the boulevards of its
cities were still crowded with bicycles]{.underline}**. (Indeed, in key
respects, it is actually hard to say what China's GDP actually was at
that point in the first place, for in those days China still measured
its GDP by Soviet-era metrics.) **[There were no McDonalds restaurants
in any country ever ruled by a Communist Party, and South Korea had yet
to finish its transition to the democratic and capitalist powerhouse of
the Sixth Republic that still exists today.]{.underline}** For its part,
**[the Soviet Union was still a monolithic block, still maintained its
imperial control over the countries of Eastern Europe, and had not yet
begun its efforts at economic restructuring]{.underline}** (perestroika)
that helped lead to such momentous change in the region.

In technological and economic terms, in other words, the environment in
which the MTCR's technological parameters were established was an
entirely different universe from the one we inhabit today.

Make no mistake. Nothing was wrong --- nor is anything wrong today ---
with the animating principle of the MTCR: that nonproliferation
principles require restraint and circumspection in transferring systems
that could conceivably be used to deliver WMD. This remains as important
a principle as ever. What fidelity to this key principle means in
practice, however, cannot ignore the whirlwind of technological changes
that have been taking place in the world.

Not surprisingly, **[the MTCR framework is today somewhat
outdated]{.underline}**. **[A system that fixed in place technical
standards based upon military hardware of the Cold War era, its approach
to UAS predates the extraordinary revolution in UAS development that has
occurred in recent years. That revolution --- which is still underway,
and in many respects picking up steam --- has seen an explosion in UAS
applications and technology that has, among other things, seen the
emergence of increasingly broad ranges of systems that technically fall
within MTCR Category I standards but that are not as significant in
terms of WMD-related threats.]{.underline}**

**[Though not threatening in the way that the MTCR aspired to prevent,
however, these emerging UAS are very valuable, and increasingly subject
to a]{.underline}** **[great range of diverse uses entirely unrelated to
WMD, not just for military purposes]{.underline}** --- e.g., having
become essential in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
applications, and having an emerging roles in areas such as logistics
--- but also throughout the civilian economy, science, industry,
commerce, logistics, safety, environmental management, forestry,
agriculture, entertainment, recreation, and more. This is a fast-growing
sector, and soon to be quite a huge one.

Not surprisingly, the great value of these systems and their growing
diversity has led to a growing demand for UAS, including for systems
technically within the Category I framework, and this demand has
elicited a growing supply.

But **[MTCR Partners are to an important extent shut out of much of this
exploding market, unable to participate fully in the commercial benefits
of this booming sector --- because of the high hurdle imposed by the
MTCR's reflexive presumption of denial for all Category I systems
---]{.underline}** and with their governments unable to reap the full
benefits of the relationships that UAS engagement can bring as countries
around the world seek to expand their capabilities into these diverse
new, non-WMD-related areas.

But **[other suppliers --- and in particular those outside the MTCR
framework, who are not bound by its strictures and who may feel no
special obligation to scrutinize proposed transfers from a rigorous
nonproliferation perspective as we do --- are not shut out in this
way]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[for them the MTCR is a tool of
competitive advantage against MTCR Partners. Against all of us. Such
other suppliers are increasingly stepping in where MTCR Partners find it
difficult to tread because even non-WMD-relevant UAS systems are covered
by strict Category I rules with their associated presumption of
denial]{.underline}**. Under the right circumstances and with
appropriate nonproliferation assurances, of course, it is not impossible
to overcome a presumption of denial, but having to overcome such hurdles
for the modest subset of Category I UAS that are in reality not a
WMD-related threat represents a considerable impediment --- and, we
think, an unnecessary one.

Th**[is situation harms not just the competitiveness of MTCR Partners,
but also the MTCR itself --- and the cause of nonproliferation. It puts
needless pressure upon the MTCR and could threaten its long-term
integrity,]{.underline}** for institutions that do not know how to be
appropriately flexible in a changing world risk shattering. Nor does
continuing this rigidity stop the spread of UAS, because non-MTCR
supplies are stepping into this market.

be part of the solution, but would currently be difficult to accomplish
given Washington's obligations under the Missile Technology Control

regime designed to control the spread of missiles, which ostensibly
governs drone exports too but has so far failed to prevent their
spread.]{.underline}**

An agreement adrift. **[The G7 nations founded the MTCR in 1987 to
prevent the proliferation of delivery systems for weapons of mass
destruction, especially those with a range of more than 300
kilometers]{.underline}** (km) **[and a payload capability of over 500
kilograms]{.underline}** (kg). **[Under the regime, missiles with such
capabilities are designated Category I systems. Exports of Category I

W**[hile drones are different from missiles in important respects, the
MTCR lumped them in with cruise missiles in the early 1990s because they
are remotely piloted, travel over long distances, and could
theoretically carry weapons of mass destruction.]{.underline}** Over
time, **[technological developments mean UAVs have become more versatile
in their military applications, a strong motivating factor behind the
desire to stop their proliferation]{.underline}**. **[What this has
unfortunately meant is that transparent, cooperating members of the MTCR
are prevented from selling UAVs abroad, while non-members
like [China](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_11/MTCR) and [Israel](https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/mtcr)can
export UAVs, regardless of payload and range, to many
customers.]{.underline}** In China's case, these customers include
Egypt, Jordan, and other states that are allies or partners of the
United States. These UAV-selling non-members are often not transparent
about their platforms' capabilities, or export UAVs that they claim have
capabilities just under the Category I limits.

**[Some of the flaws giving rise to this situation are embedded in the
MTCR itself. For instance, when applied to drones, the range and payload
guidelines built into the MTCR seem arbitrary]{.underline}**. Category I
items [include](http://mtcr.info/mtcr-guidelines/) "rocket systems ...
and unmanned air vehicle systems" above the 300 km and 500 kg limits.
 But **[these limits do not denote any meaningful divide in UAV
capabilities. In addition, inhabited aircraft]{.underline}** (those
piloted by a person on board) **[[are
exempt](http://mtcr.info/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/) from MTCR
restriction]{.underline}**s. **[This is as it should be, since missiles
and airplanes have different characteristics. But it means the United
States can, for example, export a fighter jet like the Boeing
F-15---which has a range of more than 2,000 km and a maximum payload of
almost 13,400 kg---while being barred from exporting an MQ-9 Reaper
drone]{.underline}**, which is slower, easier to shoot down, and carries
a payload only a tenth the size. **[One might argue that UAVs should
count as missiles because a bad actor could load a weapon of mass
destruction on one and use it as a sort of cruise missile. But a
military could use remote piloting to accomplish the same task with
existing fighter aircraft that are unregulated by the
MTCR]{.underline}**. In fact, **[inhabited aircraft are much more like
drones than missiles, in that they are reusable and directly piloted
rather than preprogramed.]{.underline}**

**[Due to that "strong presumption of denial" clause, and
despite [domestic policy
changes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/20/a-new-u-s-policy-makes-it-somewhat-easier-to-export-drones/?utm_term=.b88ba82272ed),
it is difficult for the United States to sell advanced armed drones to
many allies and partners, such as Jordan.]{.underline}**

Options for reform. **[The status quo has not just failed to control the
spread of armed drones, but also undermined the credibility of the MTCR
as a whole.]{.underline}** **[Reform is necessary. From an American
perspective, if the United States could export UAVs under rules more
like those governing exports of fighter aircraft, it]{.underline}**
co**[uld ensure that countries use their drones more responsibly than if
they acquire drones from other sources. US drone exports could also
build the capacity of US allies and partners, who would generally prefer
to buy American anyway]{.underline}**. **[The [Arms Export Control
Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-39) requires
governments receiving weapons from the United States to use any
armaments only for legitimate self-defense and in accordance with
international law.]{.underline}** Moreover, diminishing the market share
of non-members of the MTCR would reduce their ability to use drone
revenues for future technology development. Additionally, **[allied
forces using American UAVs, instead of Chinese or Israeli platforms,
would have greater interoperability with the US military.
Interoperability enables coalition building, can reduce alliance-wide
military expenditures, and increases the overall efficacy of military
capabilities.]{.underline}**

To help achieve these goals, **[members need to rethink the MTCR, though
there are no clear fixes for how to move forward.]{.underline}** The
regime operates by consensus, making substantive change difficult to
achieve. Russia, for example, is well aware of the way the MTCR
constrains American UAV exports, and might seek to block any changes, or
threaten to violate the regime by exporting more Category I missiles in
response. Such challenges notwithstanding, it would be worthwhile to
continue discussing changes to regime rules.

**[One option would be altering the MTCR to put drones in the same
category as inhabited aircraft, which are not regulated by the regime.
This would be a common-sense solution, as UAVs are more like aircraft
than they are like cruise or ballistic missiles]{.underline}**.

A second option might involve a broader shift away from exclusive
reliance on the 300 km and 500 kg restrictions. For example, adding a
speed constraint to the definition of a Category I system could
distinguish missiles from UAVs, since missiles travel so much faster.
This kind of shift might be more palatable to other members than the
first option. But UAVs will evolve over time, and could become
significantly faster. Creating restrictions based on a snapshot of the
technological present runs the risk that regulations will become
obsolete sooner rather than later.

### MTCR old

#### The MTCR has become obsolete in the realm of slowing drone prolif

#### The MTCR was outdated regime nearly 2 decades ago -- we still haven't changed a thing about it 

**Carnegie Endowment for International Peace**, 4-12-**2001** (The
Carnegie Endowment is a foreign-policy think tank, \"How Effective is
the MTCR?,\"
<https://carnegieendowment.org/2001/04/12/how-effective-is-mtcr-pub-672>)
(CB)

**[The MTCR is based on a policy, not a treaty]{.underline}**. **[It
focuses on ballistic and cruise missiles capable of delivering a 500
kilogram payload to a range of 300 kilometers]{.underline}**. Any
rockets or unmanned air vehicles with this capability, including space
launch vehicles (SLV\'s), which are \"peaceful\" versions of long-range
missiles, are subject to a strong presumption of export denial.
**[The]{.underline}** regime imposes more flexible export controls on
dual-use items. The 33 **[member states often coordinate their diplomacy
to discourage missile proliferation.]{.underline}** Some members
(notably the U.S.) back up their diplomacy with sanctions.

**[The regime has experienced some visible failures, such as missile
developments in North Korea, India, and Pakistan]{.underline}**. But it
has also realized some noteworthy successes such as the suppression of
the Argentine, Egyptian and Iraqi Condor II ballistic missile program
and South African and Central European missile activities. The MTCR\'s
export denials have yielded quieter successes, such as delays in the
Indian and Pakistani programs.

The MTCR provides an international norm for missile non-proliferation.
Among major suppliers of missile technology only North Korea refuses to
acknowledge this norm.

MTCR Problems

**[The MTCR faces challenges in at least three areas: the stability of
its rules of restraint, the technical coverage of its restrictions, and
the continued activities of some missile suppliers.]{.underline}**

Rules: Last month **[South Korea became the 33rd member of the MTCR. The
conditions under which they joined allows them to develop longer range
missiles than heretofore, and even to resume development of an SLV
abandoned under U.S.]{.underline}** pressure a decade earlier. **[After
similar concessions to Brazil and Ukraine]{.underline}** in the
mid-1990\'s, one may ask: **[Are governments now joining the MTCR in
order to acquire bigger missiles?]{.underline}**

**[MTCR members have often discussed missile export restraint with
non-member China.]{.underline}** Late last year, **[the U.S. welcomed
China\'s new formulation of the restraint Beijing will apply. China now
says it will not export \"nuclear-capable ballistic missiles.\" This
leaves open the question of how it will treat such MTCR-restricted items
as cruise missiles or missiles capable of delivering chemical or
biological agents - and whether multiple sets of rules are now being
established.]{.underline}**

The MTCR rules face competition from alternative proposals meant to
promote missile restraint among non-members. Last year the MTCR members
proposed a \"code of conduct\" featuring inspections of proscribed
missile-related programs. Some observers fear such dealings could lead
to acceptance of those programs. Last month Russia held an international
conference outside of the MTCR to promote a \"Global Control System\".
And the UN Secretary General and others are proposing global missile
non-proliferation treaties, some offering SLV cooperation as an
incentive for participation by \"have-nots\".

Technology: **[As military systems evolve is the MTCR adequately
covering them?]{.underline}** Unmanned air vehicles
(**[UAV\'s]{.underline}**) - **[cruise missiles and systems readily
converted to them - are particular concerns. Controls on stealthy cruise
missiles, key components such as engines and guidance/control systems,
and definitions of range and payload may be falling behind the
times.]{.underline}**

Moreover, **[as large UAV\'s evolve for reconnaissance, missile
launching, and even civilian communications - pressures are growing to
relax MTCR restrictions. Given the likely importance of unmanned combat
air vehicles (UCAV\'s) and other UAV\'s in the Bush Administration\'s
military strategy, these issues will come to the fore very
soon.]{.underline}**

Suppliers: **[As an export control regime the MTCR depends on supplier
restraint. It has succeeded in restricting many potentially troublesome
exports from Western Europe. However, restraint has been lacking in
three suppliers.]{.underline}**

Reportedly, **[Russia is leaking or deliberately supplying
MTCR-restricted missile technology to India and Iran]{.underline}**.
**[China\'s latest missile restraint proclamation has yet to be fully
defined and implemented, and China may be continuing to export missile
technology to Pakistan and the Middle East. And North Korea continues to
export Scud-based missiles and their technology.]{.underline}**

**[Secondary suppliers such as India and Iran are a growing concern.
Some, such as Iran, are under a U.S. embargo. But for others and for
China, U.S. sanctions, designed especially to restrict exports from MTCR
non-members, have been little used in recent years.]{.underline}**

### MTCR Useless

#### The MTCR is fundamentally [useless]{.underline} for stopping missile prolif -- its own member states contribute to category 1 missile transfers 

**Knox 17** (T.J. Undergrad at UPenn \"The State Of The Missile
Technology Control Regime,\" Summer Program for Undergraduate Research
(SPUR). Available at <https://repository.upenn.edu/spur/22>) (CB)

**[Of the new missile powers, the predominant means of acquisition has
been missile transfers from the historical missile
states,]{.underline}** accounting for 53.1% of missile acquisition as
compared to domestic development, Indeed, **[with 10 of the 15 new
missile states only gaining ballistic missile capabilities due to
transfers from the historical states alone, it is evident that the MTCR
has been unable to entirely prohibit ballistic missile transfers to new
states. The trade in ballistic missile technology continues. Moreover,
the arsenals of these new missile powers are largely composed of
ballistic missiles which meet the MTCR Category I
classification]{.underline}**. **[This stands in contrast to the
Regime's strong presumption of denial on the export of these
weapons.]{.underline}** Particularly concerning is the subversion of the
export regime by its own Partners. As discussed, the United States and
Russia have continued to engage in the transfer of ballistic missiles
since 1987. **[While the MTCR does not prohibit its Partners from
engaging in missile transfers, the frequency in which the United States
and Russia have participated in the practice undermines the integrity of
the export regime as a voluntary, consensus-driven
arrangement]{.underline}**, **[and reinforces the reality that there are
no consequences for violating the export regime. It appears that the
domestic development of ballistic missile can be catalyzed by missile
transfers. In the case of Israel, Ukraine, and Libya,
independent]{.underline}** **[domestic development was undertaken after
the transfers of existing ballistic missiles]{.underline}**. **[With the
requisite expertise and technology in-hand, these states were able to
achieve the capability to develop more 12 sophisticated missiles with
little to no state assistance.]{.underline}** These states illustrate
how proliferation can be exponentiated through the simple transfer of a
short-range ballistic missile to another state, with the understanding
that these transfers can provide a platform for independent development.
Lastly, **[the Missile Technology Control Regime has proven ineffective
in curtailing proliferation in the Middle]{.underline}**
**[East]{.underline}**. **[The region has become increasingly armed
since 1987 through both domestic development and missile transfers, and
only Turkey, out of 14 new and historical missile powers in the region,
is party to the MTCR. This absence of MTCR adherence in the Middle East
is perhaps one of the greatest factors undermining the effectiveness of
the Regime both now and into the future, as the risk of both missile
transfers or deployment in warfare continues to rise as proliferation
continues]{.underline}**. Ultimately, **[the inadequacy of the Missile
Technology Control Regime over the past thirty years demonstrates that
it is time to strengthen the export regime]{.underline}**. ● **[The
subversion of the MTCR by its own Partners is a systemic weakness to the
export control regime. As of now, there is little that can be done to
enforce the Regime, considering that it is a voluntary arrangement among
cooperative states. However, it would be useful to consider if it is
time to move beyond a voluntary export regime to a treaty-based
instrument, with the power to censure or sanction violators of the
Regime]{.underline}**. ● The MTCR places a strong presumption on the
denial of Category I ballistic missile technology. However, those
Partners which choose to engage in missile transfers may 13
inadvertently be catalyzing independent missile development by
recipients, as documented in the case of Libya, Ukraine, and Israel.
Partners should be diligent about this possibility in determining if it
should export Category I or even non-Category I missiles to other
states. ● The Middle East is a primary priority for integration into the
export regime in order to stymie further proliferation in region.
Working with Middle Eastern states to secure export control pledges and
opening dialogue to integrate the region's missile powers into the
Regime is a necessary step to revitalizing the MTCR. **[While the
Missile Technology Control Regime and its Partners acknowledge the
impossibility of preventing missile proliferation entirely, it is
evident that the Regime has become outdated since its inception three
decades ago. In a geopolitical environment where ballistic missiles are
more relevant than ever to state conflict, foreign relations, and
national security strategy, antiproliferation efforts must be founded
upon a renewed Missile Technology Control Regime.]{.underline}**

#### MTCR is allowing China to meet export demands for UAVs and missiles -- they are selling to potentially bad actors with no checks on who they sell to

**Zissimos**, 4-26-**2018** (Rachel, Former Policy Analyst, National
Security and Defense Studies \"Export Control Reform: Better Late than
Never,\" Heritage Foundation,
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/export-control-reform-better-late-never>)
(CB)

Last Thursday, the **[Trump administration released a [Presidential
Memorandum](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/national-security-presidential-memorandum-regarding-u-s-conventional-arms-transfer-policy/) that
sensibly reforms U.S. conventional arms transfer policy]{.underline}**.
The memo brings U.S. policy into closer alignment with the economic and
security interests of the U.S. and its allies, through changes that
reflect the rapid pace of technological innovation and the competitive
global environment.

An updated policy was sorely needed. Many regulations and agreements
governing U.S. arms transfers date back to when the U.S. maintained a
comfortable lead in military innovation. Since that time, globalization
has rapidly expanded other nations' access to advanced technologies and
complicated efforts to contain their spread and use.

**[U.S. export controls are intended to limit proliferation of advanced
technologies.]{.underline}** **[The idea is to exercise restraint in the
transfer and sale of conventional arms, thereby keeping U.S.
capabilities out of the hands of our foes and other repressive
governments that might use them against their own citizens.
Unfortunately, these controls inundate allies and adversaries alike with
the same cumbersome licensing requirements and bureaucratic hurdles.
These processes inhibit opportunities for trade and cooperation---to the
detriment of U.S. industry. ]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, **[foreign militaries have chipped away at the U.S.
technological edge, increasing the number of countries willing and able
to sell advanced technologies in a burgeoning world
market.]{.underline}** Governments dismayed by U.S. policy (or prices)
can turn to other exporting countries for comparable systems.

The new policy addresses these failings, placing particular emphasis on
the domestic and international regulation of unmanned aerial systems
(UAS), commonly referred to as drones.

**[The U.S. is one of 35 signatories to the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR)---a multinational agreement
promoting voluntary restrictions on the transfer of missiles and missile
technology.  Under the MTCR, unmanned systems (whether armed or unarmed)
"[capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kg to a range of at
least 300 km](http://mtcr.info/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/)" are
categorized among the most heavily regulated items, for which export
requests "[are subject to an unconditional strong presumption of
denial](http://mtcr.info/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/)."]{.underline}**

**[As could be expected, the MTCR has been principally effective in
limiting the sales of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by its
signatories. The result has been to keep valuable capabilities away from
countries with overlapping security interests.  Meanwhile, China has
jumped to meet the global market demand, exercising far less restraint
and discernment about to whom it will sell both armed and unarmed UAVs.
As China expands its share of the global UAV market, it also expands its
influence in the regulation and use of autonomous
systems.]{.underline}**

Arms transfers will always carry a level of risk. But the U.S. is no
longer the only player in the game. The administration's new policy
recognizes the limitations of previous regulations.

Now, **[the U.S. must work to eliminate obsolete and bureaucratic
barriers to U.S. exports, including inefficient licensing requirements
and outdated technology controls. A system that is streamlined and
responsive to global economic and security environments will better
support U.S. industries, and advances the best interests of the U.S.,
its partners, and allies.]{.underline}**

### !D to drone sales

#### Drone sales do not destabilize arms [or]{.underline} trigger an arms race

**Greenberg**, 4-24-2018 (Erik Lin, PhD candidate in the Department of
Political Science at Columbia University, where he studies international
relations. \"Why Washington's New Drone Export Policy Is Good For
National Security,\" War on the Rocks,
<https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/why-washingtons-new-drone-export-policy-is-good-for-national-security/>)
(CB)

Drone proliferation pessimists often lament that weakening drone export
controls will [make it
easier](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/the-moral-hazard-of-drones/) for
states to launch military operations and destabilize security by
triggering arms racing between states eager to one-up their rival's
drone capabilities. These concerns are likely overstated for two
reasons.

**[First, the transfer of drones is unlikely to be inherently
destabilizing]{.underline}**. To be sure, **[the reduced risk associated
with operating remotely piloted aircraft may lead risk-averse
decision-makers to more frequently launch drones on intelligence
gathering and strike missions.]{.underline}** However**[, limited
transfers of drone technology have had a minimal effect on regional
stability.]{.underline}** For
instance, **[[Iraq](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/business/international/china-drone-export-iraq.html) and [Nigeria](https://www.popsci.com/watch-nigerias-first-confirmed-drone-strike) have
used recently acquired drones to launch missile strikes on suspected
terrorists,]{.underline}** **[but these operations have been limited in
scale and geographic scope]{.underline}**. **[Carrying out worldwide
drone operations like those conducted by the United States requires a
massive [technological and logistical
infrastructure](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636412.2016.1134189?journalCode=fsst20),
and as I describe in a [forthcoming book
chapter](http://eriklg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Proofed-Find-em-First_April-2018.pdf),
a complex backbone of intelligence personnel and organizations that
costs billions and takes decades to develop.]{.underline}** Even if
countries acquire drone aircraft, it takes time to develop the required
network of bases, satellites, computer systems, and personnel before a
state can conduct sustained, large-scale drone operations.

Second, **[even if the sale of drones under the new policy triggers
drone arms racing, remotely piloted aircraft often have a stabilizing
effect on crisis situations]{.underline}**. As I have [argued
elsewhere](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/23/so-china-seized-a-u-s-drone-submarine-welcome-to-the-future-of-international-conflict/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f8e399e3db50#comments),
drones allow states to carry out military operations without risking
significant escalation. **[Drones can help stabilize crises by
collecting intelligence that can make subsequent operations more precise
or limited, or can be deployed in lieu of more escalatory means, like
ground forces or manned aircraft.]{.underline}** **[While states may be
more prone to launch drones on risky missions, states are unlikely to
take escalatory military or diplomatic responses after a drone is lost
to enemy action. I]{.underline}**n other words, drones provide a
de-escalatory off-ramp that typically is not an option when inhabited
assets are involved. For instance, **[the Pentagon largely ignored
Syria's [downing of a remotely piloted Predator reconnaissance
drone](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2015/06/29/air-force-lost-predator-was-shot-down-in-syria/) in
2015. In contrast, Syria's recent shoot down of an inhabited Israel Air
Force F-16 fighter in February triggered a massive Israeli retaliation
that
reportedly [destroyed](https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/israel-took-out-half-of-syria-s-air-defenses-military-beliefs-1.5808981) half
of Syrian air defenses]{.underline}**.

As drones become an increasingly common fixture on the modern
battlefield, the new export policy marks an important step in managing
their proliferation and promoting Washington's national security
interests. Streamlining the drone export process helps Washington
strengthen ties with allies and partners, enhances interoperability
during coalition operations, and limits the ability of competitors to
jeopardize U.S. influence. But more can be done to ensure allies can
acquire U.S. drones. For instance, one retired Air Force general
just [called for
changes](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/04/white-house-relaxing-drone-exports-heres-good-next-step/147611/) to
the Missile Technology Control Regime that would reclassify drones like
the Reaper and ease their export. Until then, China and other drone
producer states may attempt to woo customers by undercutting U.S.
prices. Or, they might impose fewer political conditions to sales,
allowing exports to states with shadier human rights records.

### No ! Space Debris

#### **No ! to Space Debris -- its exaggerated**

White House National Space Council, and Paul Graziani is the founder and
CEO of Analytical graphics which is a company that develops technology
for space operations and monitoring. \"Op-ed,\" SpaceNews, Published

\|Trip\|

[There are over a half million pieces of human-made material in orbit
around our planet]{.underline}. Some are the size of school buses, some
the size of BB gun pellets. They all had a function at some point, but
now [most are simply space debris littered from 100 to 22,000 miles
above the Earth]{.underline}. Yet, [all behave perfectly according to
the laws of physics. Many in the space community have called the
collision hazard caused by space debris a crisis.]{.underline}

[Popular culture has embraced the risks of collisions in space in films
like Gravity. Some participants have dramatized the issue by producing
graphics of Earth and its satellites, which make our planet look like a
fuzzy marble, almost obscured by a dense cloud of white pellets meant to
conceptualize space congestion.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, for the sake of a good visual[, satellites are depicted
as if they were hundreds of miles wide]{.underline}, like the state of
Pennsylvania (for the record, there are no space objects the size of
Pennsylvania in orbit). Unfortunately, this is the rule, not the
exception, [and almost all of these articles, movies, graphics, and
simulations are exaggerated and misleading. Space debris and collision
risk is real, but it certainly is not a crisis.]{.underline}

So what are the facts?

On the positive side, [space is empty and it is vast]{.underline}. [At
the altitude of the International Space Station, one half a degree of
Earth longitude is almost 40 miles long. That same one half a degree at
geostationary orbit, some 22,000 miles up is over 230 miles
long]{.underline}. Generally, [we don't intentionally put satellites
closer together than one-half degree]{.underline}. That means [at
geostationary orbit, they are no closer than 11 times as far as the eye
can see on flat ground or on the sea:]{.underline} That's the horizon
over the horizon 10 times over. In addition, [other than minute forces
like solar winds and sparse bits of atmosphere that still exist 500
miles up, nothing gets in the way of orbiting objects and they behave
quite predictably. The location of the smallest spacecraft can be
predicated within a 1,000 feet, 24 hours in advance.]{.underline}

[Since we first started placing objects into space there have been 11
known low Earth orbit collisions, and three known collisions at
geostationary orbit. Think of it: 135 space shuttle flights, all of the
Apollo, Gemini and Mercury flights, hundreds of telecommunications
satellites, 1,300 functioning satellites on orbit today, half a million
total objects in space larger than a marble, and fewer than 15 known
collisions. Why do people worry?]{.underline}
