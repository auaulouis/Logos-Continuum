## Legalize CP

### 1NC

#### The United States Federal Government should collaborate with Mexico on the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission's New Hemispheric Drug Strategy.

#### CP solves Latin American Stability

**[Shirk 11]{.underline}** David A. Shirk, March 2011, The Drug War in
Mexico Confronting a Shared Threat Council Special Report No. 60//ALiang

The opportunity for effective U.S.-Mexico cooperation to address these
shared concerns has grown, thanks to the resolve of Mexican leaders to
embrace the fight against transnational organized crime. **[The United
States clearly has a vested interest in helping Mexico improve its
governance, national security, economic productivity, and quality of
life, which are integral to making Mexico a better neighbor and trade
partner in the longer term]{.underline}**. Mexico is also eager to
continue working toward these ends, and it has embraced unprecedented
levels of collaboration.

27Recommendations for U.S. Policy

Over the next five years, the best-case scenario will bring a turning
point in which **[authorities gain the upper hand against organized
crime, violence dies down to pre-2006 levels, and illicit drug flows
diminish dramatically]{.underline}**. This would require **[continued
progress in disrupting organized crime groups, with the reduction in
drug-related violence the primary metric of policy
success]{.underline}**. For now, at least, the **[nightmare scenarios of
government collapse, widespread political insurgency, or sudden military
takeover are as unlikely in Mexico as they are in Brazil and Colombia,
which have even higher levels of violence]{.underline}**. Still, without
progress on the noted recommendations, **[Mexico's drug war will drag
onward and downward indefinitely, with greater and more geographically
dispersed violence, more direct political influences by organized crime,
rising instability and fear, growing human and capital flight, and
increasing spillover effects to neighboring countries,]{.underline}**
including the United States. **[Challenges and setbacks are inevitable,
and building greater trust and cooperation will require sustained
efforts]{.underline}**. Events in late 2010 and early 2011, such as
WikiLeaks' disclosure of persistent skepticism within the U.S. embassy
in Mexico City of Calderón's government and military performance, and
the death of a U.S. immigration and customs agent at the hands of drug
traffickers, led to an unexpected nadir in U.S.-Mexico relations. The
surprise Obama-Calderón summit of March 2011 reflects both countries'
desire to move past short-term diplomatic disruptions. **[The United
States can help shift the balance in Mexico's battle against organized
crime and prevent the further spread of violence within Mexico and to
its neighbors. This will require a serious commitment to U.S.
responsibilities at home, long-term investments to make Mexico a more
secure and prosperous neighbor, greater multilateral cooperation
throughout the region, and a more sensible policy for managing the harms
associated with drugs.]{.underline}**

#### Drug war unsuccessful -- empirics prove

**[Hoopes 2016]{.underline}** Michael Hoopes, 2016, \"The Mérida
Initiative at 7 Years: Little Institutional Improvement Amidst Increased
Militarization,\" No Publication,
https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/the-m%C3%A9rida-initiative-at-7-years-little-institutional-improvement-amidst-increased-militari//ALiang

As Mérida funding continues, President Obama continues to imply that the
Mexican government, even in the wake of the crises of 2014, is
displaying performance worthy of further funding. For example, in a
January 2015 press conference, President Obama responded to questions on
recent allegations of state involvement in the Iguala massacre by
voicing support for his Mexican counterpart. After the two met at the
White House in early January, **[Human Rights Watch wrote an open letter
to President Obama that expressed concern over his failure to confront
Peña Nieto on the government\'s involvement and mishandling of the
Guerrero case (Hernandez, 2015).]{.underline}** After the January
meeting between Obama and Peña Nieto, the **[Mexican president told the
press that both officials renewed their commitment to collaborating and
exchanging information to remain effective in the fight against
organized crime (]{.underline}**see La Jornada, 2015). Soon after, in
February 2015, President Obama appealed to the U.S. Congress for \$80
million to be apportioned to "dismantling criminal organizations" in
Mexico (Esquivel, 2015).

Especially in light of the 2014 crisis, the question embodied in Senator
Leahy\'s 2013 comment that "it\'s not clear yet what president Peña
Nieto\...is doing differently" merits special attention when considering
the merits of the type of support that the Obama Administration
continues to offer the Mexican government. Elected in 2012 on a platform
that promised to prioritize curbing violent crime over the high-profile
and militarized operations against organized crime groups favored by
Calderon, Peña Nieto has done little to curb violence or depart from his
predecessor\'s policies. Despite these goals, one Brookings Institution
fellow echoed most expert conclusions regarding the Peña Nieto
Administration\'s security policy when she asserted in late 2014 that
"the Peña Nieto administration fell straight back not only into relying
on the Mexican military in combination with the Federal Police to cope
with violence\...with essentially the same operational design as the
previous Felipe Calderon administration" (Felbab-Brown, 2014).

Understanding **[how little Mexican security policy has departed from
the militarized tactics of the drug war\'s earlier years is important
for understanding the degree to which U.S. aid is
justified]{.underline}**. **[As the Obama Administration began to
respond to human rights concerns associated with the imparting of
militarized U.S. aid to Mexico by adjusting overall Mérida Initiative
goals to prioritize non-military approaches to curbing
violence]{.underline}**, it would be assumed that U.S. officials would
offer more scrutiny to the Mexican government\'s reluctance to deviate
from its violent, highly militarized approach to cutting violence. This
has not been the case, however, as U.S. aid has continued despite the
Mexican government\'s failure to introduce security policies that rely
less on militarized tactics carried out by corrupt institutions

The **[relatively unsuccessful nature of Peña Nieto\'s more militarized
security policy has been reflected in qualitative evidence---the events
of 2014---and data on crime and violence levels in Mexico since
2012]{.underline}**. Though **[Peña Nieto assumed office promising to
oversee a 50% drop in homicides during his first year in office, the
most generous statistics only indicated a 16% drop, and as of November
2014, the national homicide rate had dropped 36% since Peña Nieto\'s
election]{.underline}** (see Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional
de Seguridad Publica, 2014). As welcome as such a drop has been, one
expert notes that the decrease in murders, marked by the cooling of
conflict in cities like Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, and Monterrey, are "to a
large extent not driven by official policies, but are mostly endogenous
to the contestation among organized crime groups" (Felbab-Brown, 2014).

The dismal improvements achieved under Peña Nieto\'s security policy is
further indicated in the purported rise of extortion and kidnapping
cases in Mexico. Based on the most conservative statistics on crime
released by Mexico\'s Secretariat of the Interior, reported cases of
kidnapping and extortion rose 17 and 12 percent, respectively. Though
reported cases of extortion by the end of 2014 marked a 26% overall drop
since Peña Nieto\'s first year in office, reported kidnappings for the
same time period registered a dismal six percent drop (see Secretariado
Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Publica, 2014).

Given Peña Nieto\'s overall lackluster ability to reduce violence, it
can be reasonably asserted that the Obama Administration\'s ongoing
support of Peña Nieto\'s fight is not due to the efficacy of his
security policies. Such a reality warrants greater scrutiny from U.S.
lawmakers, if not for strategic purposes (U.S. contributions only made
up 5-6% of Mexico\'s defense budget in 2013), then for political
purposes that would communicate higher expectations on the part of the
U.S. government (Dudley, 2013).

#### Legalization is a crucial step to reduce violence

Madeleine **[Wattenbarger 4-17]{.underline}**, (Madeleine Wattenbarger
is a journalist based in Mexico City, where she writes about human
rights, politics, and culture.), 4-17-2019, \"Mexico's President Says
the War on Drugs Is Over. Not All Mexicans Agree.\", Nation,
https://www.thenation.com/article/amlo-drugs-cartels-war/ //jzn

[Perez Correa says it is crucial for the administration to take steps
toward regulating drug markets. López Obrador has insinuated in the past
that he make take steps towards legalization of cannabis, and Perez
Correa emphasizes that violence reduction will depend on how cannabis is
eventually regulated in Mexico]{.underline}. "If it is a strategy that
favors big capital, it's very possible that the violence will continue,
with farmers obligated to plant drugs becoming exploited by big
cannabis."

Snapp also argues that [the end of the drug war should necessarily
involve a de-stigmatization of drug use in general. "We have to stop
creating conditions where people who use drugs can be extorted by
authorities and where resources from drug markets get to organized
crime." Regulation, she says, should be a tool to rebuilt the social
fabric in communities torn apart by the drug war. "We can use regulation
to repair the harm that prohibition has caused," she says. "For us, it
wouldn't be a good regulation if they don't involve those who are today
involved in the illegal market]{.underline}."

## Criminal Justice CP

### 1NC

#### The United States should further enforce pillar 2 of the Mérida Initiative by providing training and resources to improve Mexico's criminal justice system, providing extradition for high profile cases, and promoting the establishment of clear legal divisions between military and police roles in Mexico.

#### Enhancing the second pillar of the Mérida Initiative is key to solving structural violence

**[Bartholomeaux 16]{.underline}** (Andrew T. Bartholomeaux, 9-2016,
"Merida Initiative: Insight Into U.S.-Mexico Relations", Naval
Postgraduate School, <https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=812548>) //AT

[The second pillar of the Mérida Initiative was focused on the criminal
justice system and historically bad records of human rights
violations]{.underline}. The 2014 CRS Report cites, "D[ue to concerns
about the corruption and ineffectiveness of police and prosecutors, less
than 13% of all crimes are reported in Mexico]{.underline}." Shannon
O'Neil writes extensively about these issues in Mexico. In a paper
titled, "The Real War in Mexico: How Democracy Can Defeat the Drug
Cartels," she labels corruption Mexico's Achilles' heel. She goes on to
observe that [the police force never received the necessary resources to
conduct objective and thorough investigations and that "the chance of
being prosecuted, much less convicted, of a crime is extremely
low]{.underline}." [Policy makers clearly recognized this issue as well,
and they made changing the trend a major goal in the Mérida
Initiative]{.underline}. [Affecting this issue in Mexico would require a
two-tier approach; one focus would be on reforming the police, and the
other on reforming the judicial and penal system]{.underline}. According
to Eric Olson and Christopher Wilson, "[Civilian institutions, not the
military, are ultimately responsible for serving justice and maintaining
the rule of law." One of the major issues with relying on the military
to perform law enforcement operations is their legal inability to
"collect evidence and interrogate suspects.]{.underline}" Therefore,
Mexico and the U.S. were forced to come up with a long-term solution and
strengthen the civilian institutions that are responsible for these
actions. Lastly, Hal Brands writes, "The Mexican army has a sorry
history of human right abuses, symbolized by the Tlatelolco massacre of
1968." From late 2006 to 2009, there have been more than 600 human
rights violations, which emphasizes the importance addressing this issue
and avoiding tackling the drug problem in Mexico with an equally
disturbing infringement on the citizens basic rights.

#### Only the CP solves for corruption within Mexican military and law enforcement -- supporting the military leads to increased HR abuse

**[Bartholomeaux 16]{.underline}** (Andrew T. Bartholomeaux, 9-2016,
"Merida Initiative: Insight Into U.S.-Mexico Relations", Naval
Postgraduate School, <https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=812548>) //AT

[One of the crucial areas for improvement, as noted by scholars, is the
improvement of Mexico's criminal justice system]{.underline}. This area
is important to focus on, because [continued use of the military will
only scar their reputation and increase human rights
abuses]{.underline}. Furthermore, d[irect conflict with DTOs has only
fragmented their organizations and increased violence as they vie for
territorial control]{.underline}. [The United States should focus on
providing the training and resources necessary to improve Mexico's
criminal justice system, provide extradition resources for high profile
cases, and encourage Mexico to not utilize the military in domestic
issues]{.underline}. On the topic of law enforcement, Laurie Freeman and
Jorge Luis Sierra advocate an absence of military involvement similar to
U.S. practices: [The United States should promote the establishment of
clear legal divisions between the military and police roles in Mexico
modeled after Posse Comitatus, the U.S. law forbidding U.S. troops from
making arrests or conducting searches or seizures within U.S. territory
that would eliminate military participation in law
enforcement]{.underline}. [U.S. drug control programs that take
advantage of the absence of such legislation in Mexico and encourage the
involvement of the military in domestic law enforcement prevent this
democratic principle from taking root]{.underline}. [Furthermore,
addressing the weakness of the criminal justice system will require
addressing corruption on all levels of this system. In 2008 and 2009, a
corruption purge called 'Operation Cleanup' exposed various high ranking
officials for forms of corruption, which included "Mexico's drug czar in
the 1990s, two former directors of Interpol Mexico, personnel in the
office of the Attorney General's special prosecutor against organized
crime]{.underline}." A monumental endeavor such as reviving Mexico's
criminal justice system will require sustained focus and resources,
which is crucial for the United States to be involved with. [While they
are training the various institutions involved and restructuring the
process, they must provide extradition resources for high-profile
arrests]{.underline}. Furthermore, they need to remain patient since
this will be a long process. John Bailey recognizes the challenges and
provides insight by stating, "First, the scope of the institutional
reforms needed to reconstruct Mexico's national police, reorient the
justice system from an inquisitorial to an adversarial (accusatory)
model, build an intelligence system, and integrate the national, state,
and local security apparatus requires decades, even at the best of
circumstances."269 In closing, [the United States should provide
training at all levels of criminal justice to increase the efficacy of
criminal investigations; Mexico must continue to address corruption,
address its over-crowded prison system, and should avoid the use of its
military in domestic matters]{.underline}, but utilize the lessons
learned to train its police force; and both sides must have patience for
this process to take effect.

#### Reforming the judicial system in Mexico is critical to solvency

**[Bartholomeaux 16]{.underline}** (Andrew T. Bartholomeaux, 9-2016,
"Merida Initiative: Insight Into U.S.-Mexico Relations", Naval
Postgraduate School, <https://www.hsdl.org/?view&did=812548>) //AT

[One of the major areas that anti-drug policies need to focus on is
strengthening institutions and addressing corruption]{.underline}. In a
2014 CRS Report, authors observe, "While bilateral efforts have yielded
some positive results, [the apparent weakness of Mexico's criminal
justice seems to have limited the effectiveness of anti-crime
efforts]{.underline}." [One of the major issues surrounding local
governments is the ability to successfully prosecute common
crimes]{.underline}. Most scholarly assessments concerning the
prosecution of common crimes reveals that [local governments punish 5
percent of these crimes, which includes homicide; that means that a
person in Mexico can kill another and have a 95 percent probability of
getting away with that crime]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the rise of
violence in Mexico simply overwhelmed this system and despite record
number of arrests, they seldom resulted in successful
convictions]{.underline}. Therefore, [even if the police were arresting
guilty parties, the system as a whole did not have the efficiency or
capacity to prosecute and incarcerate, which results in criminals
fearing little more than having their time wasted]{.underline}.
Concerning this issue, authors of a report titled Drug Violence in
Mexico state, "[All this points to a need to raise the professional
standards for police and prosecutors through a more effective system of
public defenders and greater adherence to due process in the
administration of justice in Mexico. Indeed, the best quality control of
the judicial system is a good public defender system]{.underline}."
David Shirk writes extensively on this issue; he writes, "In a 2007
Gallup poll, [only 37% of Mexicans responded positively to the question,
'do you have confidence in Mexico's judicial system?,' while 58% said
'no' and 4% 'don't know.]{.underline}'" Even more disturbing than these
numbers, only 10 percent of Mexicans had confidence in police agencies.
[It is clear that reforming the judicial system in Mexico is critical
and its historical inefficiency contributed to an environment that
facilitated the expansion of DTOs]{.underline}. That being said,
corruption has and continues to plague all levels of Mexican government.
Luis Astorga discusses this issue and the volatile environment at the
end of the PRI era; he states, "In the political changeover, the central
power faced a complex problem: the federal security institutions were
corrupt and weakened, with thousands of local police officers being
dependent on politicians of different parties." This is not a
contemporary issue, just one that has become more blatant since the
opening of the political system. Furthermore, a 2015 CRS Report states,
"While corruption has most often plagued municipal and state police
forces, federal police officers have been involved in drug trafficking
and kidnapping as well." [By utilizing federal police to combat DTOs,
this exposed them to corruption and provided opportunities to accept
bribes from wealthy drug traffickers]{.underline}. Other authors write
extensively on this issue as well. Shannon O'Neil observes, "Mexico's
Achilles' heel is corruption---which in an electoral democracy cannot be
stabilizing the way it was in the days of Mexico's autocracy."
Furthermore, Daniel Sabet writes, "Mexico's chapter of Transparency
International, Transparencia Mexicana A.C., has conducted surveys
measuring self-reported bribe payments that have consistently found that
bribes to transit police officers and public security personnel top
their list of the most common acts of corruption in Mexico." In order to
have a successful anti-drug policy, these issues must be addressed, and
they have laid the foundations for DTOs to gain power in Mexico. [One of
the dangers when addressing a weak police force is the tendency to rely
heavily on the military, which leads to another peril---human rights
abuses]{.underline}.

[Human-rights abuse is not only a historical weak point for Mexican law
enforcement but also a danger anytime a country begins to
militarize]{.underline}. It has been a tendency for the United States to
advocate militarization in the war on drugs dating back to the Nixon
Administration. That being said, this section will be broken into two
subsections. The first will analyze the historical tendency of police
forces in Mexico to commit human-rights abuses. The second will analyze
the danger of militarization and the likelihood for this to deteriorate
civilian-military relations and deteriorate the often positive
reputation of the military. Mexican police have a historical reputation
for human-rights abuses. On this topic, Sabet writes, "Transit police
were most often accused of soliciting bribes; preventive police were
most often accused of threats to be charged on false grounds, insults
and humiliations, and soliciting bribes; and ministerial police were
most often accused of threats to obtain a confession, to cause harm, or
to charge on false grounds." He goes on to state, "In addition, human
rights commission reports have detailed specific cases of police
excesses." In a 2014 CRS Report, the authors write, "[Increasing human
rights abuses by authorities at all levels, as well as Mexico's
inability to investigate and punish those accused of abuses, are also
pressing concerns." This is a major issue that undermines the work being
done by law enforcement personnel and is the reason why pillar two of
the Mérida Initiative is specifically focused on this
issue]{.underline}. This appears to stem back to the historical use of
law enforcement during the PRI era. Shannon O'Neil states, "Law
enforcement too, was used to control, rather than protect the
population." Similarly, Sabet observes, "Some scholars contend that
corruption, abuse, and ineffectiveness should not be surprising given
that historically the police primarily existed to support the governing
regime rather than to protect and serve the Mexican people[." Lastly,
this phenomenon originates from a lack of training and historical
inclinations more than spiteful attitude of law enforcement
personnel]{.underline}. O'Neil expresses, "[Most of Mexico's various
police forces continue to be largely incapable of objective and thorough
investigations, having never received adequate resources or training."
That being said, proper training of law enforcement is and should be a
crucial aspect of any anti-drug policy]{.underline}. Use of the military
should only be used temporarily and in emergency situations when rule of
law must be restored, because sustained use of the military results in
militarization and the eventual demise of their reputation

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that **[Mexico is interested
in buying equipment and weapons from his country to combat drug
trafficking and organized crime.]{.underline}** At a joint press
conference with **[Mexican counterpart Patricia Espinosa]{.underline}**,
Lavrov **[said that his country is expanding its weapons sales abroad

#### Russia has the capabilities to become mexico's biggest arms dealer

**[Sputnik 17]{.underline}** (Sputnik News, "Russian Weapons on US
border: Mexico Bets on Moscow Exports", March 5^t^, major new source for
events regarding Russian news,
[[https://sputniknews.com/world/201705031053235114-russia-mexico-military-helicopters-agreement/]{.underline}](https://sputniknews.com/world/201705031053235114-russia-mexico-military-helicopters-agreement/))

Mexico\'s readiness to buy Russian military helicopters actually
indicates that the Russian-made weaponry will soon be in place near the
US border, according to RIA Novosti. On Tuesday, Alexander Denisov, the
head of the marketing department of Russia\'s state [arms exporter
Rosoboronexport](https://sputniknews.com/military/201705021053187083-mexico-rosoboronexport-russia-helicopter/),
told Sputnik that Mexico plans to buy a new batch of Russia\'s Mi-17
military transport helicopters in the near future. \"Helicopters of the
Mi-17 type are actively used by the Mexican defense and law enforcement
agencies. ... The Mexican side is planning to buy a new batch of such
helicopters from Russia and is considering the proposals prepared by
us,\" Denisov said. He added that the Russian side also offered Mexico
Russia\'s Mi-35M and Mi-28NE combat helicopters. The agreement was
clinched at the international arms exhibition FAMEX-2017, which was held
in Mexico in late April. In an interview with Sputnik, Russian military
expert Andrey Frolov said that \"Mexico is not a member of NATO or any
other Western military alliance, which is why it has the right to buy
weapons from anyone -- whether the US likes it or not.\" He recalled
that \"Mexico has already bought Russia\'s Mi-8 and Mi-17 helicopters\"
and that \"Mexican pilots know these vehicles and are able to fly
them.\" \"The new deal is good news, which means that they are satisfied
with our helicopters and believe that the Mi-17 has superiority over its
American competitors. As for Mexico\'s possible interest in the Mi-35M
and the Mi-28NE helicopters, it was caused by the use of these vehicles
in Syria, where they performed with flying colors,\" Frolov said. He was
echoed by a Russian expert on the US, Sergey Sudakov, who told Sputnik
that Russian helicopters are on a par with US ones in terms of
characteristics, and that their price tag and maintenance expenses are
cheaper, as compared with their American competitors. \"Bolstering
military cooperation with Mexico is very beneficial for us. First of
all, this is a matter of prestige -- we actually outrun the US at their
traditional arms market. Secondly, it\'s real money. And not only for
the military hardware itself, but also for its maintenance in the years
to come, training of specialists and so on. And thirdly, the deal with
Mexico is a good advertisement of our weapons in Latin America,\"
Sudakov pointed out. According to him, by investing money in Russian
weapons Mexico seeks to provide its own military and economic security
amid the country\'s attempts to prove to both other states and its own
citizens that Mexico is not a vassal of the United States. \"Earlier, 99
percent of Mexico\'s arms imports fell on US weaponry -- a situation
that drastically changed after President Donald Trump came to power in
the US,\" Sudakov said, citing the current complicated tries between
Mexico and Washington. Meanwhile, Denisov said that Rosoboronexport was
ready to supply Russian helicopters to some other regional countries,
such as Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay. Moreover, Rosoboronexport expects
that the company would open helicopter maintenance centers in a spate of
Latin American countries in 2018, according to him. \"Such a service
center is being created in Brazil, and we are working under an offset
program. ... We hope that the maintenance of the first helicopter \[in
such a facility\] would take place end of 2018. ... Possibly, the launch
of the maintenance center in Peru will take place in 2018,\" Denisov
told Sputnik.

### China Links

#### Mexico and China are moving forwards to see what they can accomplish together

**[Financial Post 17]{.underline}** "How Trump's NAFTA threats are
bringing Mexico and China Together." Financial Post. September 1, 2017.
https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/how-trumps-nafta-threats-are-bringing-mexico-and-china-together

Donald **[Trump's repeated threat to terminate the North American Free
Trade Agreement could bring a little bit closer together]{.underline}**
the two U.S. partners who he's complained about most: **[Mexico and
China.]{.underline}** At first glance, the two are more natural
competitors than allies. Both thrive on cheap labor and assembling
products to sell to consumers in wealthier nations. When China comes
looking to buy goods from Latin America, it's usually commodities to
fuel its own boom --- iron ore from Brazil or copper from Chile ---
rather than finished products from Mexico. Yet **[they find themselves
on the same side]{.underline}** of the globalization argument ---
**[opposite the U.S.]{.underline}** --- advocating more trade as the
pathway to growth. That helps explain why President Enrique Pena Nieto
will be in China next week, meeting with President Xi Jinping, just as
U.S. negotiators are in Mexico wrapping up the second round of talks on
Nafta. Pena Nieto has been invited to a business forum at a summit of
the BRICS --- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. "This is an
intentional effort of the president to show that Mexico has alternatives
to the United States," said Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the
business group Council of the Americas. "They're in the midst of Nafta
negotiations and the U.S. president is saying very publicly that Nafta
may have to be abrogated. If you're the leader of either Mexico or
Canada, that's a pretty strong signal that you need a Plan B." Policy
makers have realized that they took Nafta for granted for much of the
past two decades and didn't advance enough in trade with other nations.
Despite having trade accords with more than 40 countries, Mexico still
sends 73 per cent of its exports to the U.S., according to International
Monetary Fund Data. **[In addition to its overtures with China, Mexico
is also working to update its trade accord with the European Union,
while deepening ties with Brazil and Argentina, as well as nations like
Japan, Australia and New Zealand]{.underline}**, who were part of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump abandoned in January. But to get an
idea of the size of the challenge, those countries bought just 11 per
cent of Mexican goods in 2016. While Mexico has managed to increase
exports to China 12 per cent since 2012, they still only account for
US\$10 billion a year. China and Mexico have traditionally been rivals
rather than partners. A sign of that competition is their share of U.S.
imports. China has more than doubled its market share in the U.S. since
joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, accounting for 21 per cent
of goods sold last year, up from 8 per cent in 2000, according to the
U.S. Commerce Department. That compares with Mexico's 13 per cent share,
not much changed from the start of the past decade. Bancomext, Mexico's
export-import bank, opened an office in Beijing in 2014 as it tried to
turn its competitor into a collaborator. Mexican authorities tout the
efforts to sell tequila to China's market of 1.4 billion consumers, as
well as cars and mobile phones. "We have to enhance the opportunities
here," Francisco Gonzalez, Bancomext's head, said in a July interview in
China's capital. "With the changes in the administration in the U.S.,
that opens a lot of opportunities because of the risk" to continuing
with just one primary trade partner, he said. **[The nations have had
difficulty collaborating before.]{.underline}** In November **[2014,
Mexico awarded a US\$4.3 billion contract to a consortium led by
China]{.underline}** Railway Construction Corp. for a high-speed line
between Mexico City and the industrial hub of Queretaro. **[The contract
was canceled three days later]{.underline}**, just before journalists
revealed first lady Angelica Rivera had agreed to buy a luxury home from
a unit of Grupo Higa, a member of the consortium. CRCC planned to bid
again on the project, but the Mexican government scrapped it early the
next year amid spending cuts. **[Chinese]{.underline}** foreign direct
**[investment in Mexico has been next to nothing]{.underline}** --- a
total of US\$600 million since 1999, compared with US\$30 billion for
Canada, US\$60 billion for Spain and US\$227 billion for the U.S.,
according to data from Mexico's Economy Ministry. One sign of progress
in relations comes from energy. China National Offshore Oil Corp, known
as CNOOC, has entered Mexico's industry by winning rights to develop two
deep water oil areas near the U.S. maritime border last year. Each could
require investment of as much as US\$4.4 billion throughout the life of
the contract to reach peak oil production, according to Mexico's Energy
Ministry. CNOOC is also qualified to bid in October to form joint
ventures with Mexico's state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos. "It's clear that
whatever bad blood was generated, **[both countries seem to have an
incentive to]{.underline}** put it behind them, **[move forward and see
what they can do together]{.underline}**," Farnsworth said.

#### Mexico wants to strengthen relationships with China

Clodomiro **[Puentes 16]{.underline}**, (), 12-16-2016, \"Following
Trump election, Mexico begins to move towards deepening ties with
China\", No Publication,
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/12/16/mexi-d16.html //jzn

The APEC summit held in Lima in November was notable [in that China all
but assumed the leading role, and in particular affirmed its commitments
to its trading partners in Latin America. Speaking at the summit, Peña
Nieto expressed the Mexican ruling class' desire to press forward with
the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),]{.underline} which now remains dead
in the water as far as participation by the US is concerned. He also
insisted on the need to "modernize rather than renegotiate" NAFTA and
voiced Mexico's willingness to "[further strengthen this strategic
alliance."]{.underline}

Mexico's ruling elite and its representatives have grown increasingly
impatient over what is seen as an overly reactive, conciliatory and
cautious response by the PRI government to the US president-elect.

An editorial in El Financiero states: "The Mexican government can't
remain with its arms crossed. Will there be a prompt, realistic,
nationalist response? Up to now, it doesn't seem so. A certain degree of
prudence is understandable, but Mexico must also be prudently bold and
prepare in the next four weeks a raft of urgent measures to face the
diverse scenarios emerging from the US."

In remarks made to the newspaper Reforma earlier this month, Miguel
Barbosa, head of the pseudo-left PRD's (Party of the Democratic
Revolution) parliamentary group, lambasted the Peña Nieto government as
"stunned, fearful, incapable of responding, with weak people responsible
for foreign affairs and trade when Mexico needs to present a firm,
dignified, patriotic stance and act intelligently." Continuing, he added
that "each action by Donald Trump that is not met with necessary
forcefulness make this government look weak and will end up undermining
it."

[Giving voice to a growing interest among ruling circles in lessening
Mexican dependence on the US by broadening its trade relations in the
Asia-Pacific region, and China in particular, Barbosa called for the
opening up of trade talks with China "in a direct manner."]{.underline}

Last Sunday, that is precisely what was initiated in a meeting between
State Councillor Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu.
According to Reuters, "[Yang said in the meeting that China's
comprehensive partnership with Mexico was 'flourishing' day by day,
adding that China wishes to deepen cooperation on trade, investment,
resources, infrastructure and financial services." No details were given
on what was discussed during Yang's "courtesy visit" with the Mexican
president shortly afterwards.]{.underline}

["The China-Mexico relationship is back on again," said Evan Ellis, a
research professor at the US Army War College who specializes in China's
presence in Latin America. "The election of President Trump and the
associated threat to NAFTA probably was one driver for (Peña Nieto) to
position Mexico to diversify its foreign economic engagements," Ellis
told the Reuters news agency.]{.underline}

The visit with Mexican state officials follows a previous meeting
between Yang and retired Army general Michael Flynn, the arch-militarist
Trump pick for national security adviser. The visit was clearly
motivated in part by Trump's calculated and provocative violation of the
"One China Policy," a cornerstone US-China diplomatic protocol, by
setting up a phone call with the president of Taiwan.

[China is Mexico's second largest trading partner, accounting for over
16 percent of Mexico's imports in 2014, as compared to 49 percent for
the US in the same year. Unlike with the US, it remains a decidedly
one-sided relationship, with a \$60 billion deficit in China's favor.
Nevertheless, the possibility of a protectionist US trade policy under a
Trump administration may end up working in Beijing's favor as it seeks
to gain a greater economic foothold in the region.]{.underline}

The recent awarding of two oil blocks that CNOOC (China National
Offshore Oil Corporation) had won in the bidding process, points to the
continuation of such a trend. The auction, the consummation of the
reactionary "energy reform," was for 10 oil blocks in total, eight of
which were sold, exceeding official expectations. Among other winners of
the bidding process were US energy firms Exxon-Mobil, Chevron and Murphy
Oil.

## Case

### Advantage

#### Ending the Merida Initiative will destroy US-Mexico relations and worsen violence 

LeóN **[Krauze 5-17]{.underline}**, (León Krauze is an award-winning
Mexican journalist, author and news anchor. He is currently the lead
anchor at KMEX, Univision\'s station in Los Angeles.), 05-17-2019,
\"Mexico wants to scrap the Mérida Initiative. That would be a terrible
mistake.\", Washington Post,

//jzn

Early every morning since he took office, Mexican president Andrés
Manuel López Obrador holds court in front of dozens of reporters,
foreign correspondents and the occasional YouTube personality for a
daily news conference. Questions often veer into sycophancy. The
65-year-old López Obrador,who is also known by his initials AMLO, seemed
genuinely flattered when a reporter inquired about his stamina: "You are
like a Kenyan runner," the woman asked. "How do you do it?"

López Obrador's answers have also gained headlines for all the wrong
reasons. Recently, a young YouTuber took to the microphone to ask the
president whether he would consider including someone regarded as one of
Mexico's most virulent anti-Semites for a position in his cabinet. "He
is a very good person," Lopez Obrador responded. This puzzling show of
support earned the president an unprecedented rebuke through an open
letter signed by 142 public intellectuals, journalists and prestigious
members of Mexican academia.

Still, the news conferences have also produced real news. A week ago,
L[ópez Obrador dropped a bombshell: he wanted to "reorient" the Mérida
Initiative, a bilateral agreement devised in the context of Mexico's
brutal drug war that has been the road map for security cooperation
between the United States and the Mexican government since 2007. "It
just hasn't worked," Lopez Obrador explained. "We do not want the
so-called Mérida Initiative."]{.underline}

His administration, [he went on, was no longer interested in military
support of any kind from the United States]{.underline}. What he would
seek from the Trump administration was cooperation aimed at development
--- both in Mexico and Central America's Northern Triangle.

López Obrador's commitment to foster growth in southeastern Mexico and
embark on something akin to a Marshall Plan for Guatemala, Honduras and
El Salvador is a noble endeavor. Development aid has proved to reduce
poverty and discourage emigration in ravaged areas of Central America,
such as Guatemala's western highlands. [But scrapping the Mérida
Initiative might be a step too far.]{.underline}

Created in 2007 after then-President Felipe Calderón embarked on a
costly and violent confrontation against the country's powerful drug
cartels and other criminal organizations, [t**he Mérida Initiative has
enhanced bilateral collaboration on both law enforcement and
intelligence sharing,** two areas jealously guarded by the Mexican
government. With its \$3 billion commitment, the Mérida Initiative has
paled in comparison to the United States' ambitious 15-year, \$10
billion pledge known as "Plan Colombia," but has nonetheless produced a
number of landmark achievements that shouldn't be easily
dismissed.]{.underline}

In a recent piece for Mexico's El Universal newspaper, security analyst
Alejandro Hope argued that the Mérida Initiative has indeed had its
share of troubles, including the absence of reliable metrics to gauge
its success. [Still, Hope writes, **the program has also been "a way for
the United States to accept its share of responsibility for the problem
of organized crime in Mexico**."]{.underline}

[According to Hope, the program's funds, which in the beginning were
indeed used for the acquisition of military equipment --- which López
Obrador criticizes --- have recently been assigned to crucial issues
such as crime deterrence or the consolidation of Mexico's frail judicial
system. "The program needs to be redesigned; its objectives, rethought,"
says Hope. "**But to discard 12 years of institutional lessons doesn't
seem to be the best way of dealing with our neighbor to the
north."**]{.underline}

[López Obrador's controversial idea will likely face pushback in the
United States, as well.]{.underline}

For Alan Bersin, who served during the Obama administration as the
commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and as assistant secretary
of international affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, [the
Mérida Initiative has been a categorical success. "The principal
objective of building trust and confidence between Mexican and U.S. law
enforcement and military institutions and individuals was achieved
beyond expectations on either side," Bersin told me during a recent
interview. "The cooperation that exists today was unthinkable a
generation ago."]{.underline}

Bersin agrees that a hypothetical Marshall Plan for Central America
would be "of great value to the development of southern Mexico and the
Northern Triangle Countries," but it should be seen as complementary to
the current agreement, not as its substitution.

["López Obrador is mixing apples and oranges when he talks of converting
Mérida into a Marshall Plan," Bersin told me. "Development takes years
while incessant violence takes lives daily; security and development are
not mutually exclusive variables. They can only succeed if they proceed
in tandem."]{.underline}

Bersin, who has worked on cross-border conflict for decades, seems
adamant: ["It is not the time to back away from rather than face up to
the significant security challenges facing Mexico."]{.underline}

He is right. Despite López Obrador's best intentions, violence in Mexico
has not abated. Quite the contrary: [the country experienced its
bloodiest months in the first quarter of 2019. The state of Veracruz and
Mexico City have each recently witnessed shocking scenes of
violence.]{.underline}

#### Cartels Can Just Walk Across Border for Guns

launched in 2014, with a focus on criminal justice, guns, and drugs.
"Where do Mexican drug cartels get their guns? The US." Vox. January 14,
2016. https://www.vox.com/2016/1/14/10771628/gun-violence-america-mexico

The GAO also reported: ATF **[data]{.underline}** also
**[show]{.underline}** that these **[firearms were most often purchased
in Southwest border states]{.underline}** and that about half of them
were long guns (rifles and shotguns). According to Mexican government
officials, high caliber rifles are the preferred weapon used by drug
trafficking organizations. According to ATF data, **[most were purchased
legally in gun shops]{.underline}** and at gun shows **[in the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates**[, and then trafficked
illegally to Mexico.]{.underline}** The GAO noted that in addition to
traditional trafficking, many guns are trafficked as different weapon
parts that are put together once they\'re in Mexico. These guns are much
more difficult --- sometimes impossible --- to track. More broadly, the
report shows the wider consequences of America\'s relaxed gun laws.
**[The empirical research is clear that the abundant access to guns in
the US leads to more gun deaths in the US. But it also]{.underline}**
apparently **[leads to more gun deaths in Mexico.]{.underline}** Mexico
is one of the few countries that, like the US, guarantees the right to
bear arms in its constitution. Still, **[Mexico maintains]{.underline}**
some fairly **[strict gun laws]{.underline}**: All guns must be
registered through the federal government, carrying a gun requires a
license, sales are legally limited to one store in Mexico City, and
carrying licenses can be taken away at the federal government\'s
discretion. **[The US]{.underline}**, by comparison, **[doesn\'t have
these standards]{.underline}**, they can be bypassed, or they vary from
state to state. (For more on US gun laws, and how they compare with
those of other developed countries, read my explainer.) So **[one way
for Mexicans to get around their country\'s strict gun laws is to simply
walk across the border.]{.underline}** To visualize this problem, look
at this map from MetricMaps, which shows just how many gun dealers are
on the US side of the US--Mexico border, a sharp contrast to just one
legal gun store in Mexico: This is a problem we see in the US too: No
matter how strict your gun laws are, it\'s going to be hard to stop the
flow of guns if someone can simply go to a neighboring state or country
and buy a gun easily. Christopher Ingraham at Wonkblog, for example,
documented that many of the guns used in crimes in the US come from
states with lax gun laws. So while the **[research clearly shows that
more guns mean more gun deaths --- and less access to guns can reduce
gun deaths]{.underline}** --- ultimately **[any impact gun control laws
have will be diminished if a neighboring government doesn\'t enforce
equal or stricter laws.]{.underline}**

AMLO doesn't want policy

<https://www.pacificcouncil.org/newsroom/us-mexico-security-relationship-has-made-progress>

#### AMLOs new policies will shift violence from cartels to the lower end of the supply chain

Madeleine **[Wattenbarger 4-17]{.underline}**, (Madeleine Wattenbarger
is a journalist based in Mexico City, where she writes about human
rights, politics, and culture.), 4-17-2019, \"Mexico's President Says
the War on Drugs Is Over. Not All Mexicans Agree.\", Nation,
https://www.thenation.com/article/amlo-drugs-cartels-war/ //jzn

During his presidential campaign, López Obrador insisted he'd take a new
approach to the drug war. Instead of the militarization that
characterized his predecessors, López Obrador has largely advocated for
peace building and transitional justice, even speaking about the
possibility of amnesty for narcotraffickers during his presidential
campaign. In November, [López Obrador presented his National Peace and
Security Plan that plans to "reformulate the combat of
drugs"]{.underline} through changing structures of penalization of
drugs, address impunity of state actors, reorient national security
strategies and seek justice for victims of drug war-related violence. In
presenting the plan, the president discussed the need to "begin a peace
process with organized crime organizations and adopt models of
transitional justice that guarantee the rights of victims."

Such a change in approach could mean moving from the prohibition and
criminalization that has defined drug policy worldwide since the 1960s.
Zara Snapp, the founder of drug research and advocacy organization
Instituto RIA, sees López Obrador's declaration as primarily a shift in
strategy. ["It means they aren't going after the big capos
anymore]{.underline}," she explains. But while the war against the
narcotraffickers has ended, she argues, "[the government also needs to
end the war against the people." That includes everyone from families of
disappeared people, to people displaced by turf wars, to drug users and
small-scale producers]{.underline}

[López Obrador has also announced a new Plan for Search of Disappeared
People, with an allocation of \$2 million to investigate the cases of
the 40,000-some disappearances since the start of the drug
war]{.underline}. Amaya Ordorika, who advocates for sensible drug policy
and the end of the drug war with the nonprofit group ReverdeSer
Colectivo, says the new plan could be a step towards repairing some of
the harm of the drug war[. Historically, families of disappeared people
have faced, at best, a lack of capacity and institutional will in
investigating their cases, and at worst, corruption and complicity of
authorities in forced disappearance.]{.underline}

Ordorika echoes that a new drug strategy ought to move from
criminalizing the substances and illegal markets themselves, to
centering the communities affected by the war on drugs. "We talk about
narcotrafficking and everyone imagines Chapo Guzman or the big cartels,"
she says, "but if we unpack the concept of narcotrafficking, a ton of
people at different levels in the chain participate in different ways."

[At the lowest end of the supply chain are small-scale farmers who
cultivate poppy and marijuana, women who transport small amounts of
drugs and small-scale sellers who tend to be people with few economic
alternatives. "These populations are over-criminalized]{.underline},"
Ordorika says, as organized crime structures treat them as replaceable,
and they lack the protection of powerful drug capos.

There's another side to these developments: [while López Obrador has
spoken in favor of demilitarization, NGOs and activists have criticized
his implementation of a new National Guard because of its potential to
heighten military presence. The original plan called for the body to
comprise active members of the military, the federal police and military
and naval police. A report from the NGO Mexican Commission for Defense
and Promotion of Human Rights (CMDPDH) argues that the National Guard
gives further license to the human rights violations that have occurred
as a result of the drug war, and that it is contrary to the
"transitional justice process" that López Obrador has mentioned with
respect to the drug war.]{.underline}

The Senate eventually approved the measure under the condition that it
remain under civil, rather than military, control, but [López Obrador
announced in April that the head of the National Guard would be a
military general. Catalina Perez Correa, a researcher at the Drug Policy
Program at Mexico City's Center for Economic Research and Education
(CIDE), says that the National Guard has the potential to go either way.
"It depends how it is implemented," she says. "It could be an
opportunity to reduce the damage that has been caused by militarization,
unless AMLO uses it as an excuse to further militarize the
country]{.underline}."

[While most of these proposals are popu]{.underline}lar, they are also a
source of concern. [They are inspired by Mexico's old politics of
clientelism]{.underline}, replacing former mechanisms of federal
spending by direct transfers to future potential voters. [Through
authoritarian,]{.underline} personal appointments, they bypass the
deeply corrupt federal system, based on all-powerful governors. [They
also tend to further militarize Mexico's failed war on drugs and
organized crime, which has claimed more than 250,000 lives and around
40,000 missing persons since 2006.]{.underline}

[Many of these plans will in all likelihood not come to fruition.
Government revenues were down 7.5 percent in January]{.underline}; the
economy cooled down in October and barely grew in January. Mexico's new
governments always need time to carry out their plans. Some have had a
major impact during their first 100 days, like Carlos Salinas in
1988-99, or Felipe Calderón in 2006-07; others less so. There is always
a learning curve, particularly after the end of the Revolutionary
Institutional Party, or P.R.I., in 2000. [But in Mr. López Obrador's
case the sheer incompetence of his cabinet is a major obstacle to his
promises' becoming policies. Additionally, growing violence throughout
the country ensures that the process for this government will be even
more drawn out.]{.underline}

So it is not just a matter of the practical difficulties in handing out
money in ways that free market theorists like Friedrich Hayek and Milton
Friedman would not have dreamed of, but also that there is no money to
hand out. [Most economists are now forecasting a sharp decline in
government revenues and spending this year, as well as a decline in
foreign and private domestic investment]{.underline}. They estimate a 1
percent growth in the gross domestic product at best, perhaps less.

[January was also Mexico's bloodiest month since records on homicides
have been kept. December was no better. Pressure from Washington to
crack down on shipments of cocaine from Colombia and fentanyl from
China, and increasing poppy cultivation in several Mexican states
suggests no end to the violence]{.underline}. This, in turn, will
continue to frighten investors and tourists.

[He has shown authoritarian, demagogic inclinations, and there are
virtually no institutional counterweights in Mexico today. Mr. López
Obrador is filling Supreme Court vacancies with his supporters, and the
political opposition is in complete disarray. The only opposition exists
in the markets and the punditocracy.]{.underline}

Hopefully the few existing checks and balances and economic realities
will ensure that he does a minimum amount of harm. But given the nature
of his rhetoric, this is unlikely[. How will Mr. López Obrador react
when reality sets in and he discovers he can't fulfill his promises? The
reckoning may be sooner than later.]{.underline}

Mexico likes weapons

**[Webber 18]{.underline}** (Jude Webber, 3-13-2018, \"Mexicans torn on
how much to fear 'dangerous' Amlo,\" Financial Times,
<https://www.ft.com/content/83f540ce-222a-11e8-9a70-08f715791301>)

Mexicans ought to know what they think about Andrés Manuel López Obrador
after the election front-runner's three decades in politics, the last
dozen on the campaign trail in pursuit of the presidency.  To many, the
man known as Amlo is an honest and plucky David, a champion of ordinary
folk, who will fell the Goliath that is Mexico's corruption-tainted
ruling class in the election on July 1. But [many business leaders and
investors see him as a demagogue who is stuck in a 1970s ideological
time warp and will pitch Latin America's second-biggest economy into
Venezuela-style ruin.  "Is Amlo a wolf in sheep's clothing or has he
really become a democrat?"]{.underline} Asks one former head of the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).  The latest poll,
from Parametría, shows Amlo extending his lead with 35 per cent of the
vote, over Ricardo Anaya, heading a right-left coalition, on 21 per
cent, and José Antonio Meade of the PRI on 16 per cent. Mr López Obrador
has had to work to repair his credibility after he defied President
Felipe Calderón's wafer-thin victory in 2006 and set himself up as
parallel head of state in Mexico City's main square, causing traffic
chaos. This time he has vowed to retire to his ranch in southern Mexico
if his third presidential bid fails --- even if, he says, they "dare to
do fraud". The challenge is for Andrés not to scare people Alfonso Romo,
adviser to Amlo But captains of industry still shudder at the prospect
of a President Amlo. "Building bridges with him crosses everyone's mind
but it's like a family feud --- there's too much bad blood," says one
member of the business elite in the country's corporate capital,
Monterrey. "There's a real perception of autocracy, authoritarianism and
vindictiveness." Nonetheless, polls show a clamour for change among
voters angry at spiralling violence and endless corruption scandals.
Many either embrace a man who says he alone can wipe out corruption, or
are persuaded to give him a shot.  "Let's hope he wins so we can try out
his proposals and, perhaps, see a change," says Margarita López Aguilar,
hawking trinkets on the waterfront in the tourist resort of Los Cabos. 
Mr López Obrador, who sees Fidel Castro as a "giant" like Nelson
Mandela, is a former firebrand. In 1996, he blockaded facilities of
Pemex, the state oil company, demanding compensation for farmers and
fishermen. He later branded supporters of allowing foreign companies
into Mexico's oil sector "traitors".  Why Mexicans support hard-left
challenger Amlo Subtitles unavailable Today, the former Mexico City
mayor puts out soothing signals. He promises not to roll back the
four-year-old energy reform that has attracted pledges of \$200bn in
investment so far. He says he will work with the private sector on
infrastructure projects, will not introduce new taxes or increase
existing ones, and has promised to roll out banking and internet
services into areas that lack them and to focus on education. While his
rivals trade corruption allegations, Mr López Obrador says he stands for
"peace and love" and promises a constituent assembly to write a "moral
constitution". Publicist Antonio Solá, who in 2006 helped sow doubt in
voters' minds by claiming Amlo was "a danger for Mexico", now predicts
he will win, with Amlo's coalition headed by his left-of-centre Morena
party.  "Andrés Manuel has stopped being a danger for Mexico, among
other things . . . because Mexicans' anger towards politicians who are
corrupt and isolated from the people is far greater than their fear of
the Morena candidate," he told Imagen Radio last month.  The eldest of
seven children from the southern state of Tabasco whose hobbies are
baseball and history, Mr López Obrador cuts a dapper figure with a crisp
shirt and silver hair. But he has suffered tragedy: at the age of 15, he
watched his brother Ramón, who had been playing with a gun, die in front
of him when it accidentally went off. He was widowed when his first
wife Rocío, the mother of three of his four children, died of lupus (he
later remarried) and he suffered a heart attack in 2013. Opponents worry
about Amlo's proposed amnesty for drug lords and his economic
nationalism --- such as his plan to invest in Mexican oil refineries and
stop importing the over 550,000 barrels per day of gasoline that it
currently buys, mostly from US Gulf refineries. "He has outdated ideas,
he's travelled very little, he doesn't speak English, he's a regional
man. He'll take us back to the 20th century," says one of Mexico's most
prominent businessmen.  Recommended Piñera returns to Chilean presidency
with new inclusive tone Cuba braced for life after the Castros Brazil
pension climbdown rebuked by rating agencies They also fear that a man
who famously said "to hell with their institutions" in response to the
2006 election result he claimed was fraud, or told former President
Vicente Fox "shut up chachalaca" --- a reference to a squawking bird ---
would be a volatile counterpart to US president Donald Trump just as the
future of the North American Free Trade Agreement is up in the air. 
They would be "two presidents with similar temperaments, both very sure
of their own influence, both working in a non-institutional environment
and focused on their own individual beliefs without a lot of guidance",
said Shannon O'Neil at the Council on Foreign Relations.  But Amlo's
down-home oratorical style, peppered with colloquialisms, his
man-of-the-people air, his personal austerity and his years visiting
every Mexican municipality connects him powerfully to voters. Polls show
he enjoys the highest support both among the young and those over 50, as
well as among university graduates and those with the least education.
The PRI, however, still outguns him in rural areas, which may be why he
has promised an "itinerant government" if he wins. "The challenge," says
Alfonso Romo, his cabinet chief if elected, "is for Andrés not to scare
people. Right now, we can't put a foot wrong." 

#### AMLO defense strategy will embolden cartels -- the plan exacerbates the military's lack of funding and incentivizes police corruption

President Nieto's Social Prevention of Violence and Delinquency program,

as the program's funding ran out by 2016. Brown discusses targeting
mid-level cartel leadership instead of the top leaders as a means of
preventing violent successions of their rule. Her suggestion targets
Obrador's platform of amnesty for non-violent cartel members. This paper
suggests that the problem with both policy **[proposals]{.underline}**
is that they **[neither adequately address nor combat the rampant

#### Mexico's military needs weapons -- they're key to fighting cartel violence

**[Partlow 15]{.underline}** (Joshua Partlow, reporter, MS in journalism
and MA in IR from Columbia University, 6-15-2015, \"What's behind
Mexico's military buying binge?,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/06/15/whats-behind-mexicos-military-buying-binge/)

MEXICO CITY\--It started with 27 rail cars full of ammunition rolling
down the tracks into Mexico. That load of 30 million bullets was soon
followed by fleets of Black Hawk helicopters and thousands of Humvees:
in all more than \$1 billion of American military equipment sold to
Mexico within the past two years. **[In a security relationship between
Mexico and the United States often described as standoffish, foreign
military sales have lately become a big exception.]{.underline}**
Admiral William E. Gortney, the commander of Northern Command, the U.S.
military headquarters that deals with Mexico, testified to Congress
earlier this year that Mexico\'s buying binge represented a \"100-fold
increase from prior years.\" What explains the shopping spree?
**[Americans and Mexicans familiar with the foreign military sales
program said that the change in part reflects a revived security
partnership between the two countries. It also shows Mexico\'s
aggressive push to modernize its military in the face of powerful drug
cartel adversaries.]{.underline}** U.S. officials have hailed the sales
in part because they\'re so rare. Gortney, the Northcom commander,
described Mexico\'s decision to approach the Defense Department about
buying military equipment as \"unprecedented\" and that it marked a
\"historical milestone\" in relations between the two countries.
Mexico\'s long been suspicious of gringo motives (at least since it lost
about half a million square miles of its territory to the U.S. in the
19th century) and has tended to not be a big U.S. military buyer,
relying more on European equipment or private commercial agreements. At
the start of President Enrique Peña Nieto\'s term more than two years
ago, his administration felt the United States had wormed its way too
deeply into the drug war, and Mexico halted many security programs. \"We
knew that the President came in really wanting to focus on things other
than security,\" said a U.S. military official who spoke on condition of
anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. \"He found
out he really needed to pay a lot of attention to security.\" In late
2013, Mexico asked the United States if it could fill a large order of
5.56 mm ammunition, and the embassy helped deliver the trainloads of \$6
million worth of bullets within 100 days, the official said. \"That case
really kind of broke the ice,\" he said. \"They saw the responsiveness
of what we could do as a partner in foreign military sales. And they
liked it.\" That sale paved the way for even larger purchases: orders
for more than two dozen UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters for the Air Force
and Navy, and more than 2,200 Humvees. Since Peña Nieto came to office
in late 2012, Mexico has purchased about \$1.5 billion in equipment
through the government\'s military sales program, plus \$2 billion more
through U.S. companies, said Inigo Guevara Moyano, a Mexican defense
consultant based in Washington. **[\"All of these buys have been to
replace existing systems that averaged 30 to 40 years old and drained
budgets through high maintenance costs and poor
availabilit]{.underline}**y,\" he said. He noted that defense spending
also rose sharply under Peña Nieto\'s predecessor, Felipe Calderon, and
that it reflects the \"maturing military-to-military relationship at the
institutional level, regardless of who is in power.\" **[The buying also
is a sign of the intensity of the war against the drug cartels. The
Mexican military has aggressive operations]{.underline}** ongoing in
several states such as Tamaulipas, on the Texas border, and Jalisco,
against the ascendant New Generation drug cartel. **[These operations
have driven a rapid increase in defense spending]{.underline}** over
much of the past decade. Since 2006, spending has tripled, from \$2.6
billion to \$7.9 billion this year. Despite the growth, Mexico spends
less than many other countries in the hemisphere, just .51 percent of
gross domestic product, compared to a Latin American average of 1.31
percent, Guevara said. In addition to tactical raids and statewide
operations against drug cartels, the Mexican military is involved in all
sorts of other missions, from vaccination programs, to reforestation, to
securing voting booths in volatile parts of the country, as it did last
week. **[The lavishly funded drug cartels it fights are sometimes better
armed and equipped than the security forces.]{.underline}** Cartel
gunmen recently shot down a Mexican military helicopter with a
rocket-propelled grenade. **[\"The Mexican armed forces, including the
Army, is one of the most overtasked military forces in the world,\" said

#### No solvency -- most weapons are trafficked

The Arms Trade: The US-Mexico Connection **[The United States is a major
supplier for arms to Mexico]{.underline}**.9 **[The number of arms
trafficked from the United States to Mexico has proliferated over
time]{.underline}**. In 1993, the mid-range estimates place the total
number of arms trafficked from the United States to Mexico at 134,045.
The high-end estimate, however, places the number of arms trafficked at
241,501. The total volume of arms trafficked between the United States
and Mexico declined between 1994 and 1996 as mid-range estimates placed
the number at 92,001, while high-end estimates were 164,591. Between
1997 and 1999, the high-end estimate for arms trafficked was 152,142.
However, **[the period between 2010 and 2012 witnessed a substantial
increase in arms trafficking. Mid-range estimates place the number of
arms trafficked at 252,906, while the high-end estimate is
426,729]{.underline}**.10 Some research indicates that there are 2,000
weapons that cross the Mexican border from the United States illegally
every day. **[According to data from Mexico's governmental research
service, the vast majority---85 percent---of the weapons in Mexico are
not legal]{.underline}**.11 Moreover, certain states in the United
States are major sources of firearms that are transported to Mexico.12
In particular, US border states are major suppliers of guns in Mexico:
California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. According to data between
2009 and 2014, Texas accounted for 41.3 percent of the firearms of US
origin seized in Mexico, which equates to 13,628. On the other hand,
California accounted for 18.6 percent---6,153---of the firearms seized
in Mexico, while Arizona represented 14.6 percent, which equates to
4,809.13 The number of firearm seizures by Mexican authorities has
increased over time. In 2006, for example, Mexican authorities seized
10,500 arms. However, the number of seizures spiked to 29,824 in 2008
from 9,553 in 2007. By 2009, authorities seized 32,332 arms.14 On
December 19, 2009, the Mexican Army found more than 6,700 rounds of
ammunition and 41 assault rifles when carrying out operations and
raiding a house in Cuernavaca. An individual living in the neighborhood
spoke with her son, a police commander named Emilio Guzmán Montejo, to
alert him of the situation. Authorities arrested Guzmán Montejo upon his
arrival to the stash house. Steven Dudley, a crime expert, contends:
"The Guzmán Montejo case illustrated two apparent patterns in the arms
trafficking business in Mexico: the involvement of active or retired law
enforcement and the use, possibly, of family members to serve as
couriers and keepers of the weapons."15 Between 2009 and 2014, 70
percent (73,684) of the arms apprehended in Mexico and traced by the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) were of US
origin, demonstrating the high percentage of US arms production that was
supplied to Mexico. During the same period, only 17 percent of the arms
seized in Mexico and trace by the ATF were classified as non-US origin.
The arms seized can be broken down into short guns, such as 9 mm or 0.38
caliber and long guns, which are AR type and 12-gauge pump action
shotgun. T**[here has been a consistent supply of arms, both short guns
and long guns, from the United States to Mexico.]{.underline}**
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seized 530 short guns in the
United States destined to Mexico in 2009. The number of short guns
seized spiked to 715 in 2012. The flow of seizures declined in recent
years but has remained relatively high: 649 seizures in 2013 and 572 in
2014. ICE authorities have seized a consistent number of long guns. In
2009, for example, ICE seized 393 long guns in the United States headed
for Mexico. The number of long guns seized declined to 282 in 2010 but
spiked to 490 in 2012. By 2014, the ICE authorities seized 350 long guns
(see Fig. 7.4). While the number of seizures can demonstrate that law
enforcement is combating arms trafficking, the seizure data can provide
a false sense of victory. In other words, increases in seizures can mean
that arms trafficking is increasing. The numbers do not reveal how many
weapons have not been seized.16 The arms trade is a very lucrative
business. The estimated dollar values of the arms trafficked between the
United States and Mexico has increased substantially over time. In 1993,
the estimated high-end value of the dollar amount of the arms trafficked
was \$60,220. During the 2010--2012 period, the value of the arms
trafficked was \$214,569. The large dollar amount of the arms trade
means that arms dealers depend on the weapons sales to Mexico. In fact,
approximately half of the firearm dealers residing in the United States
depend on the high levels of demand in Mexico.17 President Felipe
Calderón (2006--2012) has been an outspoken critic of the flow of arms
from the United States to Mexico. In February 2009, he contended that
the flow of guns entering Mexico from the United States must be
combated. **[Calderón highlighted the wide array of arms that originated
from the United States that have been seized in Mexico, contending: "Let
me express to you that we've seized in this two years more than 25,000
weapons and guns, and more than 90 percent of them came from United
States,]{.underline}** and I'm talking from missiles launchers to
machine guns and grenades."18 **[A major problem has been the ease of
access to guns, particularly at gun shows that occur along the border.
Critics of the easy access to guns have argued that the United States
should clamp down on the access to firearms.]{.underline}** Julia E.
Sweig, an expert on security and Latin America-related issues, contends
that **["the U.S. civilian firearms market continues to supply the
region's transnational criminal networks with high-powered weaponry that
is purchased with limited oversight, especially from unlicensed
individuals at gun shows, flea markets, pawn shops, and on the
Internet]{.underline}**. Lax U.S. gun laws enable straw purchasers,
including those under investigation in Operation Fast and Furious, to
legally procure thousands of AK-47 and AR-15 variants every year and
traffic them across the border to sell them illegally to criminal
factions."19

#### Mexico's main supply comes from illegal markets

<http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.444.9822&rep=rep1&type=pdf>)

At present, [public US sources indicate that commercial retail sales of
firearms and illegal black-market sales have surpassed
government-to-government deals in terms of quantity and
value]{.underline}. For example, for the years 1996--99, using data
provided by the US government and organized by the Norwegian Initiative
on Small Arms Transfers (NISAT), the US government collectively
delivered USD 376,000 worth of small arms to the governments of Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama---including ammunition of
multiple calibres, grenades, 73 short arms, and 15 machine guns. After
the same period, the US government authorized private industry to sell
USD 66,167,402 worth of arms to Central American markets, including
93,855 pistols and revolvers, 28,345 rifles (non-assault), 400
sub-machine guns, and approximately 270 million rounds of ammunition,
although there is no publicly available confirmation of actual sales
(NISAT, 2001). Data provided by the US Bureau of the Census (see Table
4), which includes both government-to-government and private commercial
sales for the same period as well as for 1994--95, indicates that actual
Central American small-arms imports did not surpass or Occasional Paper
No. 5 Small Arms Survey Page 6 [The Impact of Small Arms Misuse in
Central America come near to authorized quantities in most categories.
However, there is a marked discrepancy between the 40,369 shotguns
exported to Central American countries between 1994 and 1998 and the 906
authorized for commercial sale for the years 1996--99]{.underline} (US
Department of Commerce, 2000). Without government data for 1994--95, it
is difficult to know for certain if the total number of shotguns sold
corresponds to legal authorizations, although at face value the data
raises obvious questions. Bureaucratic differences in weapons
categorizations could explain this discrepancy.

These **[governmental sales do not count the assault rifles and other
firearms sold at retail stores and gun shows in the United States and
smuggled into Mexico]{.underline}**. Paulina Arriaga, executive director
of Desarma Mexico (desarmamexico.org), told us that one can't talk about
arms in Mexico without talking about the United States. For example,
**[the end of the assault weapons ban in 2004 provoked a spike in the
presence of such weapons in Mexico]{.underline}**.19 **[Seventy percent
of firearms seized in criminal investigations in Mexico come from the
U.S., according to the]{.underline}** U.S. Bureau of
**[A]{.underline}**lcohol, **[T]{.underline}**obacco, and
**[F]{.underline}**irearms. In fact, Arriaga says **[the U.S. is
"without a doubt the primary provider of legal and illegal arms in
Mexico." Those weapons contributed to some 65 percent of the nearly 15
million "common crimes" committed in Mexico from 2011 to 2013, and
roughly 56 percent of the 57,000 homicides committed since
2013.]{.underline}** Of the U.S.-sourced guns seized by authorities at
crime scenes in Mexico, up to a half of them were imported into the
United States from other nations, according to a Violence Policy Center
report. If the United States restricted imports of assault weapons, it
could reduce the flow of such weapons to Mexico, even without a full
U.S. legislative ban on the sale of assault weapons.20
