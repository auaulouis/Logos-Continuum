**[Today the order remains intact, despite the hostility of the present
administration and the weakness of the last.]{.underline}** **[The
international structures supporting it are durable]{.underline}**. This
is partly [because they rest on geographical realities and a
distribution of power that still favor the liberal order
and]{.underline} still [pose obstacles to those who would disrupt
it]{.underline}. It is also because [liberal values,]{.underline} though
under assault, [remain a force that binds the democratic nations of the
world together.]{.underline} Authoritarianism also has its appeal and
will always compete with liberalism, but the [authoritarian governments
do not feel the same sense of commonality as]{.underline} the monarchies
and aristocracies of the early nineteenth century. [The Chinese and
Russians]{.underline} are not adversaries, but they [are not
allies]{.underline} either. They share little except their antipathy to
liberalism. [The democratic nations, however, are bound
together]{.underline} by more than common adversaries, as the post--Cold
War era has proved. [America's alliances in Europe and Asia have so far
held]{.underline}, therefore, [despite the weakening of America's
commitment under two administrations. **There is still a liberal world
order to be salvaged**]{.underline}, if the American people decide it is
worth salvaging. [They will also have to decide that they are prepared
to pay the costs]{.underline}, and those costs have not changed. It took
great and consistent exertions of American power and influence to create
and sustain this world order. It will take no less to continue upholding
it into the future. [Americans]{.underline} over the past two decades
[have]{.underline} become convinced that the United States is doing too
much when actually it has [been doing too little. Much of what needs to
be done to shore up the order requires only diplomatic and economic
measures]{.underline}. [The United States needs to return to the deep
engagement with Europe]{.underline} that characterized the relationship
from the postwar years to the early post--Cold War years. Americans must
understand that [a healthy liberal Europe is the anchor of the order
from which they benefit]{.underline}. Therefore [such matters as the
negotiation of Britain's withdrawal from the EU, the Eurozone crisis,
the cyber threats from Russia, and European energy supplies must be
addressed]{.underline} not just as European problems but as
transatlantic problems that affect the United States, too. [The United
States also needs to work with European governments to
address]{.underline} the [democratic backsliding]{.underline} in Europe.
Nations that entered the EU and NATO after the Cold War had to meet high
standards of democratic governance in order to gain membership. If some
have ceased to meet those standards, they need to be suspended from
membership or denied some of the benefits of membership. Hungary and
Turkey cannot expect to enjoy the benefits of NATO, and, in Hungary's
case, EU membership, so long as they celebrate their "illiberalism" and
reject the basic premises of the liberal world order. Finally, [the
United States needs to return to]{.underline} the liberal compact when
it comes to [trade and international institutions]{.underline}. It was a
serious blow to the liberal order when the United States walked away
from the Trans-Pacific Partnership---and a great boon to China. The
order will suffer further if American trade policies seek "wins" over
close allies like Canada and Germany. Americans need to understand that
[the free trade regime undergirds the order from which they benefit as
much or more than anyone]{.underline}. It is not a "win" if that regime
collapses into the protectionism that characterized the decades before
World War II. Then [there is the question of maintaining America's
military predominance]{.underline} in the international system. [For all
the talk of "soft" power and "smart" power, **it is
ultimately**]{.underline} the American security guarantee, **[the
ability to deploy hard power to deter and defeat potential aggressors,
that provides the essential foundation without which the liberal world
order could never survive]{.underline}**. Members of Congress from both
parties have underfunded the military since the beginning of the
post--Cold War era, but especially over the last decade. Defense
secretaries from both parties have raised alarms about the increasing
inability of the armed forces to perform their missions of deterrence
around the world. And the dangers of war have only grown in recent
years, not diminished. [Americans need to remember that deterring a war
is much less expensive than fighting one. It is]{.underline} not only
the money to preserve power, however, but [also the willingness to apply
that power, with all the pain and the suffering, the uncertainties and
the errors]{.underline}, th[e failures and follies, the immorality and
brutality, the lost lives and the lost treasure.]{.underline} Most of
what we need to do to sustain the liberal order will not require sending
troops, but there will be times when it will be necessary. [It is simply
dishonest to tell]{.underline} the American [people that the relative
security and prosperity they have enjoyed can be sustained without the
occasional threat or use of force]{.underline}. There will be challenges
on the Korean Peninsula, in the South China Sea, in the Middle East, and
along the fault lines between Russia and NATO. [**We would like to be
sure that there will be no more Iraqs and Vietnams**, and we should do
our best, learning from past mistakes, to avoid such
failures**.**]{.underline} But it would be foolish to imagine we can
avoid mistakes and failures entirely. **[There is no doctrine other than
pure isolation and inaction that can prevent such
tragedies.]{.underline}** The Obama administration offered a doctrine of
not doing "stupid" things; others have spoken of the need to fight only
"necessary" not "unnecessary" wars; in the past people have argued for
fighting only for "vital" national interests in "core" areas and
avoiding fights in the "periphery." The problem with all of these
sensible-sounding proposals is that [it is often only in hindsight that
we can be sure what was "stupid" and what was "necessary,"]{.underline}
what was "vital" and what was "peripheral" and safely ignored. There
were many smart people who believed that American intervention in
Vietnam was essential to forestall a communist victory, that it was a
vital strategic interest for the United States, partly to protect Japan
and partly in the overall effort to resist aggression. [An equally long
and distinguished list of foreign policy thinkers and politicians
supported the war in Iraq because they believed it was vital to protect
the world from what most believed were Iraq's WMD programs and from a
serial aggressor and mass killer. Later on, when those efforts
failed]{.underline}, when the intelligence proved faulty and the
political-military strategies inadequate, [many of those who supported
those wars declared]{.underline} not only that they were a mistake but
[they were an obvious and avoidable mistake]{.underline}---even though
they themselves did not see it at the time. That is one of the problems:
**[many mistakes are not obvious until they are made]{.underline}**.
**[So]{.underline}**, **[too]{.underline}**, **[the distinction between
supposedly "necessary" and "unnecessary" wars]{.underline}**. **[Prior
to December 1941]{.underline}** and Germany's declaration of war on the
United States, many American experts and **[the great majority of the
American people did not think it was necessary to go to war in Europe to
defeat Hitler]{.underline}**. As for wars on the periphery, the world is
not a collection of distinct regions neatly walled off from one another.
We may call one region "Europe," one "Asia," and one "the Middle East,"
and we may say we will intervene in one but not the other. This is an
artificial construct, however. Regions abut one another and bleed into
one another; their histories, cultures, and religions as well as their
economies are tightly entangled. Great powers have been intervening in
the Middle East and Persian Gulf for centuries, before there was oil and
before there was a Suez Canal. [To extricate ourselves from the Middle
East would mean extricating ourselves from the world connected to and
through the whole region]{.underline}. Even that might not keep us from
having to intervene. In recent decades we have learned, tragically, that
**[what happens in the Middle East does not stay in the Middle
East]{.underline}**. Americans would love never to have to think about
the Middle East again, but no administration has succeeded in
extricating the United States from it---not even Obama. Meanwhile, [the
more we rely on proxies like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel to
determine the course of events in the Middle East, the less it will be a
course we would choose]{.underline}. [Even if they could manage the task
without us]{.underline}, which seems unlikely, [it will be their
interests they will be protecting, not ours]{.underline}, and not those
of the liberal order. For the United States, it is not a question of all
in or all out. We cannot intervene everywhere, and we haven't ever come
close to doing so. In the Middle East and elsewhere, we will still be
required to make decisions: when to intervene, how to intervene, how
much to commit, and how long to stay, and the answers will not be
obvious and the outcomes will not be certain or even predictable. Nor
will our interventions "solve" the problem; or they will solve one
problem and create others. **[Those who insist on outcomes that pose no
further dangers and require no further involvement are asking the
impossible]{.underline}**. Our intervention in World War II defeated
Hitler but led to Soviet communist control of half of Europe and four
decades of Cold War. That is the messy reality. President Obama said he
didn't like the idea of just putting a lid on problems like Syria. But
the most masterful foreign policies in history, whether those of a
Bismarck or a Disraeli, have always been about containing rather than
solving problems. America's entire grand strategy since World War II has
been about putting lids on problems, in Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere.
Whether that is good or bad depends on what's under the lid and whether
it is better to keep things under it than to let them out. T[he American
people would like a foreign policy that avoids mistakes and
disasters]{.underline}, and who can blame them? [But that is a bit like
wanting to throw touchdowns but not interception]{.underline}s, to make
only good investment decisions, [or to win all your cases.]{.underline}
The price of failures in **[foreign policy]{.underline}** is measured in
human lives and national treasure, and therefore the greatest care must
be taken to get it right, but it **[nevertheless remains a human
activity and therefore subject]{.underline}** both **[to]{.underline}**
our foibles **[and the failure of our best-intentioned efforts to
predict the future]{.underline}.** People don't stop what they're doing
after a mistake is made; they try to do a better job next time. **[We
can't quit having a foreign policy, even if our geography, our wealth,
and our power sorely tempt us to try.]{.underline}** There are,
moreover, two kinds of errors: errors of commission and errors of
omission. After World War I, Americans were more focused on the former;
after World War II, they worried more about the latter. Today we are
fixated almost entirely on errors of commission. A couple of years ago,
Robert Merry, the editor of The American Conservative, made a list of
"America's Five Biggest Foreign Policy Fiascoes." At the top of the list
was Iraq, followed by America's entry into World War I, the Vietnam War,
the intervention in Somalia, and the Bay of Pigs "invasion." These were
all acts of commission. But [**what about the "fiascoes" that resulted
from our failure to act?** What about our failure to destroy al
Qaeda]{.underline} bases in Afghanistan [before three thousand people
were killed in the Twin Towers]{.underline} and the Pentagon; [or the
failure either to deter]{.underline} or to prepare adequately for [a
Japanese attack on the Philippines, which led]{.underline} in early 1942
[to the death of ten thousand American and Filipino
soldiers]{.underline} in three months of fighting followed by the deaths
of thousands more in the infamous Bataan Death March? Was that not a far
worse error than the tragedy which led to eighteen American dead in
Mogadishu**[? What about the price the liberal world order, and
particularly America's key allies in Europe, have paid for our failure
to contain the crisis in Syria?]{.underline}** Were not these errors of
omission more costly than our errors of commission in Somalia? [At the
root of such thinking is the belief that]{.underline} there is an escape
from power or that [it is possible to wield power without error and
without failure]{.underline}. Americans, blessed by their favorable
geography and wealth, still believe they have a choice between engaging
the world and letting the world fend for itself. There has been no
shortage of realists, idealists, progressives, and conservatives telling
them that substantially disengaging from our alliances and overseas
commitments is possible and cost-free. But [the real choice we face is
not between the good and the bad but between the bad and the
worse.]{.underline} **[It is between maintaining the liberal world
order]{.underline}**, with all the moral and material costs that
entails[, **or letting it collapse and courting the catastrophes that
must inevitably follow. What is likely to follow is a return to the
multipolar power struggles**]{.underline} **[that brought so much
devastation]{.underline}** to the world before the United States
redirected the course of history. That is where the deep ruts lead, back
to the state of the world prior to 1945. **[Only this time, the powers
competing and clashing will be armed with nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. It is ironic that some of those who spent the
Cold War warning that America's hawkish foreign policies would result in
nuclear holocaust do not seem to fear nuclear war in the competitive
multipolar world that may be our future. [We have yet to test the
question of whether nations with nuclear weapons can go to war, because
so far the United States and the liberal world order have prevented such
wars.]{.underline} But if history is any guide, to count on the horror
of new weaponry alone to maintain the peace is a most risky bet. Had you
cast that bet before the two world wars, you would have lost. These days
some experts tell us it was the existence of nuclear weapons that
prevented the United States and the Soviet Union from coming to blows,
but few at the time had any confidence that nuclear weapons were a
guarantor of peace. Throughout much of the Cold War there were those who
simply assumed that the world was heading inevitably toward Armageddon.
They were wrong that it would come as a result of American Cold War
policies, but in the long run they may still prove right. --- These are
the quandaries we cannot avoid no matter how hard we try. Reinhold
Niebuhr believed that what he called "the world problem" could not be
solved if America did not "accept its full share of responsibility in
solving it."187 To support a "world community beyond our own borders" he
went on, both was virtuous and reflected a "prudent understanding of our
own interests." But he also predicted that Americans would be "the
poorer for the global responsibilities which we bear." And poorer not
just in a material sense but also in a moral sense. It was impossible
"to build a community without the manipulation of power," and it was
impossible "to use power and remain completely 'pure.' "188 As Hans
Morgenthau put it, "Whoever wants to retain his moral innocence must
forsake action altogether." Niebuhr did not want Americans to have an
"easy conscience" about the things they were going to have to do, for
there was always the danger that they would enjoy power too much and
would use it to dominate others rather than to address the "world
problem." But he also did not want their "uneasy conscience" to "tempt
us into irresponsibility."189 Americans, it is fair to say, have not
enjoyed power too much. These days, they would prefer to wield it less.
Yet the struggle for power in the international system is eternal, and
so is the struggle over beliefs and ideals. [If it is not our system of
security and our beliefs shaping the world order, it will be someone
else's.]{.underline} **[If we do not preserve the liberal order, it will
be replaced by another kind of order, or more likely by disorder and
chaos]{.underline}** of the kind we saw in the twentieth century. That
is what the world "as it is" looks like. [That is what history and human
nature have led to in the past and will lead to in the future if not
continually shaped, managed, and resisted]{.underline}.

### Impact -- Nuclear War

#### American military power is the sole deterrent of [nuclear war]{.underline} -- hegemony is key

sg

AMONG THE Trump administration's most significant national security
decisions has been the shift from counterterrorism to inter-state
competition. [The United States is increasingly engaging in global
rivalry with "revisionist" states like China, Russia, Iran and North
Korea]{.underline}. To do this well, [some U.S. policymakers have argued
that the United States needs to develop capabilities to
fight]{.underline}---and win---[conventional and possibly even nuclear
wars against these states]{.underline} if deterrence fails. As the
National Defense Strategy argues, "The surest way to prevent war is to
be prepared to win one. Doing so requires a competitive approach to
force development and a consistent, multiyear investment to restore
warfighting readiness and field a lethal force." While there are good
reasons to focus U.S. national security on balancing against global and
regional state adversaries, **[it would be a mistake to assume that most
future conflict will be conventional or even nuclear]{.underline}**. It
won't. **[The United States remains the world's preponderant military
power]{.underline}**. For Russia, Iran, North Korea and even China,
[conventional or nuclear war with the United States would be risky and
prohibitively costly]{.underline}. What's more, America's struggles in
Afghanistan and Iraq suggest that the U.S. military is vulnerable when
faced with adversaries that resort to irregular strategies, operations
and tactics. These realities suggest that [competition between the
United States and its main adversaries will likely be irregular---not
conventional]{.underline}. Russia will likely continue to focus on a
suite of overt and covert actions, from supporting state and nonstate
proxies in Syria, Ukraine and potentially the Baltics to information
warfare. Iran will attempt to expand its power through proxies in
Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan and Bahrain---not by amassing a
more potent army, navy or air force capable of fighting conventional
battles against the United States. China is already spreading its
influence in the Pacific by utilizing economic coercion, conducting a
sophisticated information campaign, and resorting to fishing vessels and
other "grey zone" tactics to lay claim to islands. Even North Korea will
likely continue to develop its special operations and cyber
capabilities.The future of conflict means that the United States needs
to prepare to compete with these states not primarily with divisions,
aircraft carriers and strategic bombers---but by, with, and through
state and nonstate proxies, cyber tools, and overt and covert
information campaigns. At the moment, however, the United States is
ill-prepared for irregular competition. [WHILE THE United States needs
to prepare for]{.underline} the possibility of [conventional and nuclear
war]{.underline}, [neither will likely be the primary means of
competition for at least two reasons. First]{.underline}, **[the United
States remains the dominant global military power]{.underline}**. [Its
defense budget is still larger than the defense budgets of the next
eleven countries]{.underline} in the world [combined]{.underline}. More
importantly, **[the United States' land, air, naval, space and cyber
capabilities are formidable]{.underline}**. For Russia, Iran, North
Korea and even China, conventional or **[nuclear war with the United
States would be risky]{.underline}**. The gap between the United States
and China, in particular, is narrowing. Beijing is developing more
accurate, long-range missiles; integrated air defense; fourth-generation
fighter aircraft; enhanced naval power projection; more advanced space
and counterspace capabilities; and nuclear forces, including a new
generation solid-propellant intercontinental ballistic missile, the
df-41. But **[U.S. military capabilities surpass those of its
competitors.]{.underline}** Second[, the costs of]{.underline}
conventional and [nuclear war are likely to be staggering]{.underline}.
Over the past several years, [the U.S. government and think tanks have
conducted numerous wargames and analyses of conflicts]{.underline} [with
Russia]{.underline} in the Baltics, [China]{.underline} in the Taiwan
Straits and South China Sea, [Iran]{.underline} in the Middle East [and
North Korea]{.underline} on the Korean Peninsula. [The results are
generally bleak]{.underline}. Most conclude that [war could lead
to]{.underline} tens or [hundreds of thousands of dead soldiers and
civilians, domestic unrest, billions of dollars in economic damages, a
global economic downturn and the potential collapse of long-held
alliances]{.underline}. In addition, **[these conflicts might escalate
to nuclear war,]{.underline}** raising the number of dead to millions of
civilians, **[create far-reaching environmental destruction and trigger
unthinkable global financial costs.]{.underline}** A U.S. war with China
could reduce China's gross domestic product (GDP) by between 25 and 35
percent and the American GDP by between 5 and 10 percent, according to a
rand report. As the report concluded: A long and severe war could ravage
China's economy, stall its hard-earned development, and cause widespread
hardship and dislocation. Such economic damage could in turn aggravate
political turmoil and embolden separatists in China. Both the United
States and China would also suffer huge numbers of military and civilian
deaths and risk large-scale destruction of their military forces. If war
expanded to include their allies, economic and casualty figures would
skyrocket even further. [Wargames that involve a conflict between NATO
and Russia]{.underline}, including scenarios with Russian forces
invading one or more Baltic countries, [often escalate to include
the]{.underline} threat---or [use]{.underline}---[of tactical nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Even a conventional war in the region could led to
substantial destruction. **[If one or both sides used nuclear weapons,
the number of casualties would be virtually unthinkable. These costs and
risks will likely give Washington, Moscow, Beijing, Tehran and even
Pyongyang pause]{.underline}**. During the Cold War, Moscow and
Washington confronted a similar bleak reality, which meant that most
competition was irregular. THE COLD War offers a useful historical lens
to assess the risks of conventional and nuclear war between major
powers. NATO planners prepared for a possible Soviet and Warsaw Pact
invasion of Western Europe. The United States and other NATO countries
deployed forces close to the intra-German and Czech-German border to
stop Warsaw Pact forces from conducting an armored blitzkrieg into West
Germany. NATO also planned for nuclear war, limited or otherwise. The
United States amassed a vast nuclear arsenal and adopted strategies like
mutually assured destruction (MAD), which assumed that a full-scale use
of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the
annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. **[The threat of
such heavy costs deterred conflict]{.underline}**, despite some close
calls. During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States and
Soviet Union nearly went to war after a U.S. U-2 aircraft took pictures
of Soviet medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs
and IRBMs) under construction in Cuba. But Washington and Moscow
ultimately assessed that direct conflict was too costly. Deterrence
held.

### Impact -- Laundry List

#### Hegemony is good -- checks revisionism, terrorism, and global war

Institution and the author of The World America Made, "Backing Into
World War III," 2/6/17,

[Think of two significant trend lines]{.underline} in the world today.
[One is the increasing ambition and activism of the two great
revisionist powers, Russia and China]{.underline}. [The other is the
declining confidence, capacity, and will of]{.underline} [the democratic
world, and]{.underline} especially of [the United States, to maintain
the dominant position it has held]{.underline} [in the international
system]{.underline} since 1945. [As those two lines move
closer,]{.underline} as the declining will and capacity of the United
States and its allies to maintain the present world order meet the
increasing desire and capacity of the revisionist powers to change it,
[we will reach the moment at which the existing order collapses and the
world descends into]{.underline} a phase of [brutal
anarchy]{.underline}, as it has three times in the past two centuries.
[The cost of that descent]{.underline}, in lives and treasure, in lost
freedoms and lost hope, [will be staggering]{.underline}. Where exactly
we are in this classic scenario today, how close the trend lines are to
that intersection point is, as always, impossible to know. Are we three
years away from a global crisis, or 15? [Americans]{.underline} tend to
[take the fundamental stability of the international order for
granted]{.underline}, even while complaining about the burden the United
States carries in preserving that stability. History shows that [world
orders do collapse, however, and]{.underline} when they do [it is often
unexpected, rapid, and violent]{.underline}. The late 18th century was
the high point of the Enlightenment in Europe, before the continent fell
suddenly into the abyss of the Napoleonic Wars. In the first decade of
the 20th century, the world's smartest minds predicted an end to
great-power conflict as revolutions in communication and transportation
knit economies and people closer together. The most devastating war in
history came four years later. The apparent calm of the postwar 1920s
became the crisis-ridden 1930s and then another world war. Where exactly
we are in this classic scenario today, how close the trend lines are to
that intersection point is, as always, impossible to know. Are we three
years away from a global crisis, or 15? That we are somewhere on that
path, however, is unmistakable. And while it is too soon to know what
effect Donald Trump's presidency will have on these trends, early signs
suggest that the new administration is more likely to hasten us toward
crisis than slow or reverse these trends. The [further accommodation of
Russia can only embolden Vladimir Putin]{.underline}, and [the tough
talk with China will likely lead Beijing to test the new
administration's resolve militarily]{.underline}. Whether the president
is ready for such a confrontation is entirely unclear. For the moment,
he seems not to have thought much about the future ramifications of his
rhetoric and his actions. **[China and Russia are classic revisionist
powers]{.underline}**. Although both have never enjoyed greater security
from foreign powers than they do today --- Russia from its traditional
enemies to the west, China from its traditional enemy in the east ---
[they are dissatisfied with the current global configuration of
power]{.underline}. [Both seek to restore the hegemonic dominance they
once enjoyed]{.underline} in their respective regions. [For China, that
means dominance of East Asia]{.underline}, [with countries like Japan,
South Korea, and]{.underline} the nations of [Southeast Asia both
acquiescing to Beijing's will]{.underline} and acting in conformity with
China's strategic, economic, and political preferences. That includes
American influence withdrawn to the eastern Pacific, behind the Hawaiian
Islands. [For Russia, it means hegemonic influence in Central and
Eastern Europe and Central Asia]{.underline}, which Moscow has
traditionally regarded as either part of its empire or part of its
sphere of influence. Both Beijing and Moscow seek to redress what they
regard as an unfair distribution of power, influence, and honor in the
U.S.-led postwar global order. [As autocracies, both feel threatened
by]{.underline} the [dominant democratic powers]{.underline} in the
international system and by the democracies on their borders. Both
regard the United States as the principal obstacle to their ambitions,
and [therefore both seek to weaken the American-led international
security order that stands in the way of]{.underline} their
[achieving]{.underline} what they regard as [their rightful
destinies.]{.underline} President Xi Jinping makes a speech during the

was good while it lasted Until fairly recently, Russia and China have
faced considerable, almost insuperable, obstacles in achieving their
objectives. The chief obstacle has been the power and coherence of the
international order itself and its principal promoter and defender. The
American-led system of political and military alliances, especially in
the two critical regions of Europe and East Asia, has presented China
and Russia with what Dean Acheson once referred to as "situations of
strength" that have required them to pursue their ambitions cautiously
and, since the end of the Cold War, to defer serious efforts to disrupt
the international system. During the era of American primacy, China and
Russia have participated in and for the most part been beneficiaries of
the open international economic system the United States created and
helps sustain; **[so long as that system functions, they have had more
to gain by playing in it than by challenging and overturning
it.]{.underline}** The system has checked their ambitions in both
positive and negative ways. During the era of American primacy, China
and Russia have participated in and for the most part been beneficiaries
of the open international economic system the United States created and
helps sustain; so long as that system functions, they have had more to
gain by playing in it than by challenging and overturning it. The
political and strategic aspects of the order, however, have worked to
their detriment. The growth and vibrancy of democratic government in the
two decades following the collapse of Soviet communism posed a continual
threat to the ability of rulers in Beijing and Moscow to maintain
control, and [since the end of the Cold War they have regarded every
advance of democratic institutions]{.underline} --- especially the
geographical advance of liberal democracies close to their borders ---
[as an existential threat]{.underline}. That's for good reason:
Autocratic powers since the days of Klemens von Metternich have always
feared the contagion of liberalism. [The mere existence of democracies
on their borders, the global free flow of information they cannot
control, the dangerous connection between free market capitalism and
political freedom --- all pose a threat to rulers who depend on keeping
restive forces in their own countries in check]{.underline}. The
continual challenge to the legitimacy of their rule posed by the
U.S.-supported democratic order has therefore naturally made them
hostile both to that order and to the United States. But, until
recently, a preponderance of domestic and international forces has
dissuaded them from confronting the order directly. Chinese rulers have
had to worry about what an unsuccessful confrontation with the United
States might do to their legitimacy at home. Even Putin has pushed only
against open doors, as in Syria, where the United States responded
passively to his probes. He has been more cautious when confronted by
even marginal U.S. and European opposition, as in Ukraine. **[The
greatest check on Chinese and Russian ambitions has been the military
and economic power of the United States]{.underline}** and its allies in
Europe and Asia. [China]{.underline}, although increasingly powerful,
[has had to contemplate facing]{.underline} the combined military and
economic strength of [the world's superpower and some very formidable
regional powers linked by alliance or common strategic
interest]{.underline} --- including Japan, India, and South Korea, as
well as smaller but still potent nations like Vietnam and Australia.
[Russia has had to face the United States and its NATO
allies.]{.underline} When united, [these U.S.-led alliances present a
daunting challenge to a revisionist power]{.underline} that can call on
few allies of its own for assistance. Even were the Chinese to score an
early victory in a conflict, such as the military subjection of Taiwan
or a naval battle in the South or East China Sea, they would have to
contend over time with the combined industrial productive capacities of
some of the world's richest and most technologically advanced nations
and the likely cutoff of access to foreign markets on which their own
economy depends. A weaker Russia, with its depleted population and oil-
and gas-dependent economy, would face an even greater challenge. For
decades, [the strong global position enjoyed by the United
States]{.underline} and its allies [has discouraged any serious
challenge]{.underline}. So long as the United States was perceived as a
dependable ally, Chinese and Russian leaders feared that aggressive
moves would backfire and possibly bring their regimes down. This is what
the political scientist William Wohlforth once described as the inherent
stability of the unipolar order: [As dissatisfied regional powers sought
to challenge the status quo, their alarmed neighbors turned to the
distant American superpower to contain their ambitions]{.underline}.
[And it worked.]{.underline} The United States stepped up, and Russia
and China largely backed down --- or were preempted before acting at
all. Faced with these obstacles, [the best option for the two
revisionist great powers has always been to hope for]{.underline} or, if
possible, engineer [a weakening of the U.S.-supported world
order]{.underline} from within, [either by separating the United States
from its allies or by raising doubts about the U.S. commitment
and]{.underline} thereby [encouraging]{.underline} would-be
[allies]{.underline} and partners [to]{.underline} forgo the strategic
protection of the liberal world order and [seek accommodation with its
challengers.]{.underline} The present system has therefore depended not
only on American power but on coherence and unity at the heart of the
democratic world. The United States has had to play its part as the
principal guarantor of the order, especially in the military and
strategic realm, but the order's ideological and economic core --- the
democracies of Europe and East Asia and the Pacific --- has also had to
remain relatively healthy and confident. [In recent years]{.underline},
both pillars have been shaken. [The democratic order has
weakened]{.underline} and fractured at its core**[. Difficult economic
conditions, the recrudescence of nationalism and tribalism, weak and
uncertain political leadership and unresponsive mainstream political
parties, and a new era of communications that seems to
strengthen]{.underline}** rather than weaken **[tribalism]{.underline}**
**[have]{.underline}** together **[produced a crisis of
confidence]{.underline}** [not only in the democracies]{.underline} [but
in what might be called the liberal enlightenment project.]{.underline}
That project elevated universal principles of individual rights and
common humanity over ethnic, racial, religious, national, or tribal
differences. [It looked to a growing economic
interdependence]{.underline} [to create common interests]{.underline}
across boundaries [and]{.underline} to the establishment of
international institutions to [smooth differences and facilitate
cooperation]{.underline} among nations. Instead, the past decade has
seen the rise of tribalism and nationalism, an increasing focus on the
Other in all societies, and a loss of confidence in government, in the
capitalist system, and in democracy. [We are witnessing the opposite of
Francis Fukuyama's "end of history]{.underline}." [History is returning
with]{.underline} a vengeance and with it [all the darker aspects of the
human soul]{.underline}, including, for many, the perennial human
yearning for a strong leader to provide firm guidance in a time of
confusion and incoherence. Left: Adolf Hitler and his staff salute teams

(Photo credit: AFP/Getty Images) The Dark Ages 2.0 This crisis of the
enlightenment project may have been inevitable, a recurring phenomenon
produced by inherent flaws in both capitalism and democracy. In the
1930s, economic crisis and rising nationalism led many to doubt whether
either democracy or capitalism was preferable to alternatives such as
fascism and communism. And it is no coincidence that the crisis of
confidence in liberalism accompanied a simultaneous breakdown of the
strategic order. Then, the question was whether the United States as the
outside power would step in and save or remake an order that Britain and
France were no longer able or willing to sustain. Now, [the question is
whether the United States is willing to continue upholding the
order]{.underline} [that]{.underline} it created and which [depends
entirely on American power or whether Americans are prepared to take the
risk]{.underline} --- if they even understand the risk --- [of letting
the order collapse into chaos and conflict.]{.underline}

### Impact -- Democracy

#### American hegemony is necessary to solve threats to [global democracy]{.underline} -- Venezuela, Turkey, and the South China Sea

sg

For many, [the situation in Venezuela appears]{.underline} very [similar
to the Russia intervention in Syria]{.underline}, in which Russian
support of President Bashar Assad helped him stay in power. Indeed, it
now appears that [Russia is]{.underline} seeking to do the same thing in
Venezuela by [attempting to exert influence in Central America in a
clear violation of the Monroe Doctrine]{.underline}. Put simply, **[past
and current Russian aggressions pose a grave threat to global order and
stability]{.underline}**, and **[American leadership is needed now more
than ever.]{.underline}** In his campaign, President [Trump spoke
consistently about changing relationships with allies]{.underline} and
on the world stage. **[Trump has threatened to pull out of NATO, rewrite
NAFTA, and end wars in the Middle East]{.underline}**. On Twitter, Trump
has continued these attacks, yet very little has actually been done.
With the escalating conflict in Venezuela[, it is vital that the United
States reembraces an approach of assertive idealism]{.underline} whereby
the our nation can and should look out for our own interests [while
continuing to serve as the global standard bearer of democracy. The
current approach of passivity]{.underline} that the United States has
taken toward Venezuela [is not enough]{.underline}. Vladimir Putin is on
the march, Maduro is regaining power, and the United States has been
unsuccessful at both sanctioning the government and providing aid to the
people. When discussing the situation in Venezuela, White House national
security adviser [John Bolton noted that the Russian presence in
Venezuela is a "direct threat to international peace and security in the
region."]{.underline} This is no exaggeration and indeed the **[lack of
action by the United States in Venezuela is indicative of the enduring
weakness in American foreign policy.]{.underline}** Earlier this year,
Bolton was seen holding notes to send "5,000 troops to Colombia." Nearly
three months later, the United States has yet to take any firm action
towards Venezuela. [Russia has actively worked to fill the gap caused by
American]{.underline} and international s[anctions by refining
Venezuelan heavy crude oil and providing aid.]{.underline} It is time
that the United States and the international community step in to stop
this. The United States must impose harsher sanctions on Russia,
Venezuela, and any person or nation that continues to work with corrupt
Maduro regime. These sanctions must be dutifully enforced by the United
States and our international allies. More than 50 nations across the
world have recognized Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of
Venezuela, yet it is the prominent authoritarian global powers of
Russia, China, and Turkey that continues to support Maduro and his
corrupt government. [The United States must]{.underline} work with our
Latin American allies to support Guaido and [ensure a peaceful
transition of power in Venezuela]{.underline}. Imposing sanctions on
Russia and Maduro, and ensuring that aid can get to the people of
Venezuela, will ensure Guaido can finally take the power he deserves. To
be sure, the conflict in Venezuela is not the only international crisis
where American leadership is urgently needed. It has been troubling to
watch as [NATO alliances slowly crumble, which is alarming in light of
the decision of Turkey to purchase a Russian air defense
system]{.underline}. Ultimately, it would not be possible to integrate
this system into the broader NATO air defense system, which has
increased suspicions that Turkey is an unreliable NATO member. Its
purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense system comes at the same time
that [Turkey is purchasing the most advanced warplane]{.underline} in
the American arsenal, [which is the F-35.]{.underline} The United States
is concerned that if Turkey operates both the S-400 and the F-35,
Russian intelligence will better understand the F-35 and the best way to
defeat it. [The inability of the Trump administration to preemptively
end the sale demonstrates its lack of leadership in foreign
policy.]{.underline} Moreover, this is indicative of the troubling trend
of **[the United States slowly abdicating its role as a leader on the
world stage]{.underline}**. Further, [Chinese aggression in]{.underline}
Asia [the South China Sea is another prime example of **the necessity of
American leadership in the international community**]{.underline}. The
recent Chinese attempt to flood the South China Sea with its ships is a
clear attempt to seize control of these disputed waters from neighboring
countries, and [it is imperative that the United States works with local
allies and use our Navy to stop this Chinese aggression once and for
all.]{.underline} It is abundantly clear that **[this vacuum in the
international community has enabled authoritarian regimes like Russia
and China]{.underline}** **[to assert undue influence]{.underline}** on
the world stage **[and endangers global democracy]{.underline}**. It is
time for the Trump administration to put words into actions in foreign
policy in a concise and deliberate manner. [The United States needs to
once again assert itself as a leader on the world stage to ensure that
aggressions and threats to international peace and security do not stand
anymore.]{.underline}

#### Despite Trump, US is still leading in global development initiatives and democracy promotion -- empirics

**Atwood 18** J. Brian Atwood is a Senior Fellow for International
Studies and Public Affairs at Brown University's Thomas Watson Institute

cooperation," *Brookings Institute*,7-31-2018, URL:

DTS

[The United States has been a global leader in the development
cooperation field for an extended period of time.]{.underline} Thus
far[, despite a disturbing general attack on the rules-based
international system by the current U.S. administration]{.underline},
**[country partners, international organizations, and other donors still
look to the United States for leadership.]{.underline}** Yet preeminence
is ephemeral, built partly on historic inertia, partly on perception,
and partly on real results. Indeed, **[inertia may be the key factor
maintaining the U.S. position today]{.underline}**. Yet more is at play
than that, including a [Congress]{.underline} [that is resisting
isolationism and deep budget cuts in the foreign affairs budget
accounts.]{.underline} POLITICAL ANTECEDENTS [The U.S. development
cooperation experiment grew out of both self-interest and
altruism]{.underline}. Concerns over the threat of communism motivated
many who supported the Truman Doctrine and its assistance to Greece and
Turkey and the even more ambitious Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe that
followed. These programs from the 1940s were influenced by the Soviet
Union's expansionist intentions; yet [there was also strong popular
support for ending the humanitarian crisis faced by European
nations]{.underline}, even the defeated Germany. [Feeding those
devastated by war and reconstructing the essential elements of
functioning economies]{.underline} were central both to alleviating
suffering and containing the communist threat. [A bipartisan consensus
assumed a strong and integrated Europe served U.S. economic and security
interests]{.underline}. That a foreign assistance program of the
magnitude of the Marshall Plan was in the national interest did not
detract from its humanitarian impact. It may not have been conceived as
"the most unsordid act in history" (as Winston Churchill purportedly
said), but its effect was both lifesaving and practical. As the late
University of Minnesota scholar Vernon Ruttan observed in his seminal
work on the antecedents of the U.S. aid program, [United States
Development Assistance Policy, "American exceptionalism" was a powerful
theme in popular political culture.]{.underline} According to Ruttan,
this perspective "spawned two conflicting doctrines." One was [the
liberal ideal in which America's role is "to lead the world...into a
more democratic and prosperous future." The other was a realist
doctrine, "that a virtuous America, prosperous and democratic, is
continuously threatened with contamination by the
anti-democratic]{.underline} and corrupt Old World (and, one might add,
by extreme ideologies)." Ruttan asserts that these two conflicting
doctrines, [a desire for security, and a need to promote values, "have
exerted a powerful influence on U.S. assistance policy from the
beginning."\[]{.underline}1 \]The two doctrines have co-existed for most
of our post-WWII history. The emphasis has evolved, depending on
presidential administrations and the nature of perceived global threats,
**[but the blend of security concerns and the desire to create a global
community in our image provide political support for American
development assistance.]{.underline}** POINT FOUR: SOFT POWER'S HESITANT
BEGINNING IN A BI-POLAR WORLD This blend of security concerns and
humanitarianism was conspicuous in President Harry Truman's inaugural
address in 1949. After listing three security-related initiatives,
Truman surprised many by adding a fourth "soft power" concept. He urged
the United States to "embark on a bold new program for making the
benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available
for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas."\[2\] Averell
Harriman was selected by Truman to run the new Mutual Security Agency.
During this period, the security focus was front and center. Despite its
idealistic birth, Point Four aid was relatively short-term and typically
directed at countries on the periphery of the Soviet Union or China.
Harold Stassen took over the post in the Eisenhower administration and
called for a US\$2 billion cut in the program, telling the Senate
Appropriations Committee, "We are seeking more defense, more rapidly,
with less dollars, lasting longer (a reference to his estimate that
protecting countries against communism might take 10 years)." Later,
Stassen, who was also assigned the task of strengthening the new United
Nations and giving it an aid-giving capacity, began to express concern
that the administration had been pre-occupied with military solutions at
the expense of economic ones.\[3\] The Mutual Security Agency was the
vehicle for the realist doctrine as it combined security assistance with
an aid program influenced primarily by geo-strategic objectives. This
was a program driven by ideological competition; development was given
secondary importance, if it was even understood as a concept. The
intentions of Truman's Point Four program were largely lost as hot and
cold war and the communist threat preoccupied the Eisenhower
administration. Efforts to use limited resources to "aid the poor" were
often awkward, culturally insensitive parodies of what passes for
development today. It was in the 1950s that the moniker "Ugly American"
took hold, further damaging the case for a program that could
successfully advance development only by working with partners over
time. THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT DIPLOMACY [The shift
toward the "liberal idealist" approach accelerated dramatically with the
inauguration of]{.underline} John F. [Kennedy]{.underline} in 1961.
Military and economic aid were separated, as the Mutual Security Agency
became [the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
The Peace Corps]{.underline} was born and the administration gave great
prominence to an Alliance for Progress in Latin America. This [coincided
with a global anti-colonial independence movement]{.underline} embraced
by Kennedy, himself the president of a nation that itself had escaped
the shackles of colonialism.\[4\] [The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961
created two accounts, the Development Assistance (DA) account to be
administered by USAID, and the Economic Support Fund (ESF) to be
allocated by the Department of State]{.underline}, for the most part
implemented in the field by USAID missions. The ESF account was intended
to support the foreign policy and security interests of the U.S. The
Development Assistance (DA) account was more focused on need and, while
it reflected the national interest as well, it looked more long term and
at developmental prospects. USAID would be held accountable whichever of
these accounts was being used, but it was often more difficult to
achieve results when partners were selected for purely political
reasons. As economist Robert F. Zimmerman wrote: ESF "has largely failed
to achieve its clearly stated economic and social development goals,
primarily because this assistance has been first and foremost a
diplomatic tool to promote U.S. political and security objectives."\[5\]
During this period, [the United States was instrumental in creating the
Development Assistance Group (DAG), an initiative to coordinate donor
assistance policies and produce accurate and comparable data on official
development assistance (ODA).]{.underline} Soon after, in 1961, the U.S.
ratified the convention creating the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD), combining the DAG and the
post-Marshall Plan office, the Organization for European Economic
Co-operation (OEEC). The DAG became the Development Assistance Committee
(the DAC), still the only permanent committee of the OECD, and an
important vehicle for U.S. leadership. President Kennedy provided a
strong political rationale for the aid program by appealing to both our
obligations as a rich country---"[our moral obligations as a wise leader
and good neighbor...our obligations as the wealthiest people in a world
of largely poor people..." and also to our security interest "as the
single largest counter to the adversaries of freedom."]{.underline} In
September 1961, Kennedy spoke at the United Nations and called for a
"Decade of Development." The initiative was endorsed by the General
Assembly, which also established concepts of development and global
priorities. A decade later, the United Nations adopted a target for the
rich countries of 0.7 percent of GDP for official development assistance
(the U.S. and Switzerland did not accept this commitment).\[6\] In
practical terms, the challenge then (and now) was how to assure that
these resources were being invested properly and effectively when
positive results so depended on the effectiveness of our partners. These
were governments with weak and often unaccountable institutions, civil
societies with very little appreciation for the requirements of active
citizenship, economies with poorly functioning micro-economic systems
(banks, customs offices, tax systems, and commercial laws), and colonial
contexts that often created ethnic tensions. Many U.S. partners were
corrupt dictatorships, but they opposed communism and thus were
beneficiaries of our aid (usually of the ESF variety). Fears of
widespread starvation in the late 1960s inspired books like The
Population Bomb, by Paul Ehrlich, and provided the impetus to share
modern agricultural technology. The Green Revolution became a model for
successful development and Norman Borlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1970 for his contribution. The Vietnam War saw the USAID budget
ramped up and the agency found itself in the middle of a hot war,
working with the military and the Central Intelligence Agency in an
effort to "pacify" villages. The USAID workforce expanded to some 21,000
employees, the highest number in its history. Yet this may have been the
nadir of the U.S. development program, as USAID became a tool of the
security establishment, calling into question its reputation as a
development partner.\[7\] BASIC HUMAN NEEDS In the 1970s, USAID
Administrator John Hannah, reinforced by presidential study commissions
and working closely with Congress, encouraged the Basic Human Needs
initiative, which focused on the provision of social services to the
world's poor. Senator Hubert Humphrey was the lead proponent of this
approach in the Senate, and House members Clement Zablocki (D-WI),
Donald Fraser (D-MN), and Brad Morse (R-MA) contributed amendments that
promoted community development, democratic governance, and the building
of economic, political and social institutions. A 1973 House Foreign
Affairs initiative, titled New Directions, called for a focus on food
production, rural development, nutrition, family planning, health,
education, and human resource development. An additional amendment by
Congressman Fraser linked human rights and democratic governance to
development.\[8\] THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL The collapse of communist
regimes in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in
1989 and 1990 provided a new rationale for the U.S. aid program. The
George H.W. Bush Administration was somewhat slow in responding to this
transition and an aggressive Congress, led by the Senate and House
Committees responsible for foreign affairs, filled the gap with Support
for East European Democracy Act (SEED) in 1989, and The Freedom Support
Act in 1992.\[9\] Near the end of the George H. W. Bush administration,
USAID was facing mounting challenges as Congress cut its operations
budget just as the demands on its resources were increasing. The
transitions in the former communist world saw the opening of new
missions at the same time that the Congressional coalition of idealists
and realists that had been supportive of foreign aid began to dissipate.
The end of the Cold War was seen as an opportunity for a budgetary
"peace dividend" and USAID, not the Defense Department, was the target.
The Agency confronted allegations that it was poorly managed, had too
many ill-defined goals (some 33 goals and 75 targets) and seemed
unresponsive to U.S. foreign policy needs. When in 1992 Appropriations
Committee Chair, Congressman David Obey, asked Secretary of State James
Baker what was wrong, he replied, "I don't know, Mr. Chairman, I don't
know." The Bush White House ordered a new study to find the answer.
George Ferris, an old friend of the President, led a bipartisan
commission to investigate. Their final report was highly critical of
USAID management and recommended that USAID be merged into the State
Department.\[10\] THE CLINTON YEARS The merger issue consumed
considerable attention in both the Executive Branch and Congress. [USAID
undertook a number of reforms, including the creation of the Office of
Transitions Initiatives (OTI), which allowed the Agency to be more
responsive to post-conflict situations]{.underline}. Other reforms
included: an effort to focus agency programming around five
developmental and humanitarian relief goals; the merger of four
Washington bureaus into two; and identification of 21 overseas missions
for closure based on the quality of the partnership, a graduation plan,
or coverage of smaller countries from a regional base. A year after
these reforms were instituted, George Ferris was quoted publicly as
describing the reforms as a "dramatic transformation" and announced that
he was rescinding his recommendation to merge USAID into State.
Management reforms were not enough. USAID sought to demonstrate that
other donors shared the goals of peace, prosperity, and democratic
principles. Taking note of USAID's effort to define its development
goals in a strategy paper, USAID joined other donor agencies to suggest
that DAC members write a political paper describing the goals of the
development community. DAC Chair Jim Michel, former career State
Department ambassador and acting administrator of USAID, drafted what
emerged in 1996, after two years of intense negotiation, as "Shaping the
21st Century: The Contribution of Development Co-operation." What
emerged from the paper were eight goals, which were in turn adopted as
part of a G-7 summit statement in 1998 and subsequently by the U.N. in
2001 as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\[11\] The creation of
goals accelerated the move toward results accountability. USAID had
already moved in this direction, and the adoption of the MDGs and the
deadlines set for achieving the goals (by 2015 in most cases) meant that
all donors had to create data measurement matrices. Development
cooperation was to be held accountable as never before. Now it was time
to turn to effectiveness. THE EFFECTIVENESS ERA A summit meeting in
Monterrey, Mexico on "Financing for Development" in March 2002 gave new
impetus, not only to the effort to increase ODA, but also to encourage
the mobilization of domestic resources through efficient tax systems,
and more effective use of these resources. President George W. [Bush
went to this meeting armed with an announcement that the U.S. would
increase ODA]{.underline}. He eventually would tie his request to a new
national security concept, arguing that defense, diplomacy and
development--the 3Ds--were the three legs of U.S. security policy. [With
the U.S. taking the lead in increasing ODA, the DAC organized a series
of high-level aid effectiveness forums.]{.underline} These Forums in
Rome, Paris, Accra, and Busan produced a number of effectiveness
principles, calling on donors to respect local ownership, to harmonize
their reporting and auditing requirements, align their projects, be more
transparent, and use country systems where possible. At the 2011 Fourth
Forum in Busan, Korea, the focus was on convincing South-South (S-S)
donors to accept the principles adopted in the earlier forums. A
"Working Party" created by the DAC engaged several "new providers" of
aid including China, Brazil, and India. A Global Partnership for
Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC) was created in Busan with a
Steering Committee co-chaired by a traditional donor, an S-S provider,
and a partner country representative. Subsequent forums in Mexico and
Nairobi focused on implementation of the U.N. Sustainable Development
Goals adopted in 2015 (see Aspen paper, "U.S. Global Leadership through
an SDG Lens," by Homi Kharas). NEW GOALS AND A NEW NATIONAL SECURITY
STRATEGY [As the 21st century moved into its second decade, there was
even more convergence around the security and humanitarian rationales
for foreign assistance.]{.underline} Today, [global crises are either
emerging or are at risk of unfolding due to transnational issues such as
migration, infectious disease, and climate-related
disasters.]{.underline} Likewise, [ethnic and religious conflicts
exacerbated by extreme poverty]{.underline} can quickly morph into
region-wide conflagrations. **[Preventing these threats would require
even more investments in development]{.underline}**, and, to his credit,
President George W. Bush recognized this, as did his successor, Barack
Obama. Both presidents embraced a national security concept built around
the 3Ds. International cooperation in development may have reached a
peak at the beginning of the second decade of the 21st Century.
[Traditional donors had increased Official Development Assistance (ODA)
by 50 percent since the MDGs were adopted]{.underline}. A new set of
universal goals---[the Sustainable Development Goals---was adopted in
2015]{.underline}. South-South providers were becoming more active led
by China, and triangular projects---with traditional donors, S-S
providers, and partner countries working together---were increasing
exponentially. [Developing countries were contributing more as domestic
resource mobilization systems (tax systems) became more efficient.
Foreign Direct Investment was increasing particularly in middle-income
countries.]{.underline} There was increasing evidence that the
effectiveness principles were making an impact on behavior. While it was
no longer the dominant influence, the United States continued to
contribute to this positive trend, leading a willing international
community. LEADERSHIP UNDER THE "AMERICA FIRST" BANNER Was this enough
to stem the inexorable surge of population and poverty? A world
population that had increased by 5 billion since the founding of the
U.N. and the Bretton Woods institutions was beginning to overwhelm the
international system. It would take additional resources and new
innovations to stabilize this new and increasingly volatile situation.
For the most part, western democracies were not uniformly generous in
responding. Instead, the immigration flows encouraged by conflict,
criminal gangs, and poverty sparked a nativist, and at times populist,
response. It may be too early to tell whether the "America First"
policies of the Trump administration will stymy efforts to fully
implement a 3D national security strategy. [The new administration's
recommended 30 percent cut in diplomacy and development foreign affairs
accounts was rejected by Congress]{.underline}. **[Momentum for more
effective development assistance---built over two administrations
through initiatives such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), legislation to make
food aid more efficient, reforms to AID Forward, the Development
Innovation Laboratory---continue to garner strong bipartisan
congressional support]{.underline}**, including through the Trump
administration's USAID transformation program. **[External support for
U.S. aid is strong. Non-governmental policy and advocacy organizations
like the Brookings Institution, the Modernization of Foreign Assistance
Network (MFAN), the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC), the Center
for Global Development (CDG), and the Blum Center for Developing
Economies at the University of California, Berkeley, have contributed
creative ideas for invigorating U.S. development.]{.underline}**

#### US hegemony promotes democracy

6-13-2019, \"The debate on American hegemony,\" DOC Research Institute,
https://doc-research.org/2019/06/the-debate-on-american-hegemony/)

[If one believes]{.underline} that [hegemony is beneficial]{.underline}
for the United States, as proponents of both primacy and liberalism
assert, [then every effort should be made to maintain it.]{.underline}
Conversely, if one does not believe that hegemony serves American
interests, which is the position of balance-of-power realists and
offensive realists, then instead of pursuing policies to maintain it,
the United States should begin adjusting to the reality of inevitable
hegemonic decline and the rise of peer-competitors such as China. [One
of the advantages of the realist conception of hegemony is its focus on
the material basis of hegemony: military and economic
strength]{.underline}. Yet even while agreeing that material
capabilities are the cornerstone of hegemony, there are a number of
contending views on the relative power position of the United States
today. A key point of contention in the debate about the durability of
American hegemony is the degree to which the United States continues to
have unrivalled capabilities. If one does not believe that hegemony
serves American interests, which is the position of balance-of-power
realists and offensive realists, then instead of pursuing policies to
maintain it, the United States should begin adjusting to the reality of
inevitable hegemonic decline and the rise of peer-competitors such as
China In Layne's terminology, "unipolar optimists believe that American
hegemony will last for a very long time and that it is beneficial for
the United States and for the international system as a whole" (Layne,
2007, p. 134). The best representatives of this view are William
Wohlforth and Stephen Brooks. Wohlforth and Brooks dispute the popular
view that China's rise represents a challenge to US hegemony, insisting
that the United States continues to have preponderant material
capabilities that are vastly greater than any other state (Brooks and
Wohlforth, 2008). According to Brooks and Wohlforth, [American hegemony
is beneficial to both the United States and the world primarily because
it greatly reduces security competition by rendering the balance of
power inoperable and continues to confer significant benefits to the
United States.]{.underline} For Brooks and Wohlforth, [it is of vital
importance that the United States continues to pursue a grand strategy
of primacy or "deep engagement" in order to prevent the return of
balance-of-power politics, which]{.underline} they argue [is not
possible in a unipolar system]{.underline} (Brooks, Ikenberry, and
Wohlforth, 2013, pp. 7-51). In contrast, 'unipolar pessimists' believe
that the United States' relative power position is declining and view
the grand strategy of primacy to be antithetical to American interests.
Most structural realists believe that global hegemony is either
impossible to achieve or fleeting. Not only is it difficult to dominate
the entire globe, but structural realists strongly believe in the
prevalence of balance-of-power politics. Contrary to unipolar optimists,
structural realists do not believe that balancing has failed to take
place since the dawn of the unipolar moment. Indeed, it is for the very
reason that active balancing is taking place especially on the part of
China and Russia, that many structural realists argue that the United
States needs to abandon the grand strategy of primacy or deep engagement
and adopt a grand strategy of restraint or offshore balancing (Posen,
2002, pp. 36-42). Liberal conceptions of hegemony have much to offer on
the debate about US hegemony. Instead of simply emphasising material
capabilities, proponents of [liberal hegemony accentuate the leadership
and institutionalised components of hegemony.]{.underline} However, like
unipolar optimists, [those adhering to liberal versions of hegemonic
stability theory argue that American hegemony is beneficial to both the
United States and the world and should be maintained.]{.underline} The
argument is that t[he United States is better able to pursue a liberal
grand strategy -- democracy promotion, free trade, interdependence, and
multilateral institutionalism]{.underline} -- when it has unrivalled
capabilities (Ikenberry, 2000). With respect to whether the United
States can maintain its unipolar position indefinitely, liberals are, in
Layne's terminology, unipolar agnostics. The question about the
durability of American hegemony is not just about trends in the relative
distribution of power but about the character of American leadership.
[According to liberal conceptions of hegemonic stability theory, US
power is not used to dominate others, but rather to provide the
leadership that is necessary for an open, liberal international order to
exist.]{.underline} This is the crux of Ikenberry's story of how the
United States after World War Two built and maintained a liberal
hegemonic order that has produced peace and prosperity for the world.
According to Ikenberry, [the United States did not use its preponderant
power after World War Two to dominate the world and create an empire.
Instead, American hegemonic leadership was wisely used to strike a grand
bargain and establish the foundations of a liberal international
order.]{.underline} With the rise of new powers, the growth of
right-wing populism, the turn to authoritarianism, and the election of
Donald Trump, the durability of the liberal international order is being
called into question. Yet most liberals remain confident that the
liberal international order will endure. Their basic argument is that
the rules and institutions the United States helped build under Pax
Americana will persist, making it difficult for revisionist states to
fundamentally change the liberal international order. [The English
School and Social Constructivism]{.underline} move the discussion of
American hegemony and unipolarity away from raw material capabilities to
the dynamics of legitimacy. Instead of engaging in the endless debate
about China's rise and the future of US power they [emphasise the role
of legitimacy in maintaining any given hegemonic order.]{.underline}
Only time will tell if future US presidents will be able to reclaim a
legitimate liberal order or if China is able to provide the legitimacy
necessary either to take over leadership of the liberal international
order or offer an alternative vision (Schweller and Pu, 2011, pp.41-72).

#### Democracy promotion is a main priority for the US

**Lawson 19** (Marian L. Lawson Specialist in Foreign Assistance Policy,
1-4-19, Congressional Research service,
<https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44858.pdf>)

[Promoting democratic institutions, processes, and values has long been
a U.S. foreign policy objective]{.underline}, though the priority given
to this objective has been inconsistent. [World events, competing
priorities, and political change within the United States all shape the
attention and resources provided to democracy promotion efforts and
influence whether such efforts focus on supporting fair elections
abroad, strengthening civil society, promoting rule of law and human
rights, or other aspects of democracy promotion.]{.underline} Proponents
of democracy promotion often assert [that such efforts are essential to
global development and U.S. security because stable democracies tend to
have better economic growth and stronger protection of human rights, and
are less likely to go to war with one another.]{.underline} Critics
contend that U.S. relations with foreign countries should focus
exclusively on U.S. interests and stability in the world order. U.S.
interest in global stability, regardless of the democratic nature of
national political systems, could discourage U.S. support for democratic
transitions---the implementation of which is uncertain and may lead to
more, rather than less, instability[. Funding for democracy promotion
assistance is deeply integrated into U.S. foreign policy institutions.
More than \$2 billion annually has been allocated from foreign
assistance funds over the past decade for democracy promotion
activities]{.underline} managed by the State Department, the U.S. Agency
for International Development, the National Endowment for Democracy, and
other entities. [Programs promoting good governance]{.underline}
(characterized by participation, transparency, accountability,
effectiveness, and equity[), rule of law, and promotion of human rights
have typically received the largest share of this funding]{.underline}
in contrast to lower funding for programs to promote electoral processes
and political competition. In recent years, increasing restrictions
imposed by some foreign governments on civil society organizations have
resulted in an increased emphasis in democracy promotion assistance for
strengthening civil society.

#### US hegemony good -- leads to democracy promotion which strengthens economies, empowers citizens, and strengthens nations abroad

**Jones 19** (Steve Jones, professor of history at Southwestern
Adventist University specializing in teaching and writing about American
foreign policy and military history. 3-20-2019, \"The Thinking Behind
the US Policy of Promoting Democracy Worldwide,\" ThoughtCo,

[Promoting democracy abroad has been one of the main elements of [US
foreign
policy](https://www.thoughtco.com/foreign-policy-of-the-us-government-4118323)
for decades]{.underline}. Some critics argue that it is harmful to
promote democracy \"in countries without liberal values\" because it
creates \"illiberal democracies, which pose grave threats to freedom.\"
Others argue that [the foreign policy of promoting democracy abroad
fosters economic development in those places, reduces threats to the
United Staes at home and creates partners for better economic trade and
development.]{.underline} There are varying degrees of democracies
ranging from full to limited and even flawed. Democracies can also be
authoritarian, meaning that people can vote but have little or no choice
in what or whom they vote for. A Foreign Policy 101 Story [When
rebellion brought down the presidency of [Mohammed Morsi in
Egypt](https://www.thoughtco.com/current-situation-in-egypt-2352941) on
July 3, 2013, the United States called for a quick return to order and
democracy.]{.underline} Look at these statements from White House Press
Secretary Jay Carney on July 8, 2013. \"During this transitional period,
Egypt\'s stability and democratic political order are at stake, and
Egypt will not be able to emerge from this crisis unless its people come
together to find a nonviolent and inclusive path forward.\" \"We remain
actively engaged with all sides, and we are committed to supporting the
Egyptian people as they seek to salvage their nation\'s democracy.\"
\"\[W\]e will work with the transitional Egyptian government to promote
a quick and responsible return to a sustainable, democratically elected
civilian government.\" \"We also call on all political parties and
movements to remain engaged in dialogue, and to commit to participating
in a political process to hasten the return of full authority to a
democratically elected government.\" Democracy in US Foreign Policy
[There\'s no mistaking that promotion of democracy is one of the
cornerstones of American foreign policy.]{.underline} It hasn\'t always
been that way. A democracy, of course, is a government which invests
power in its citizens through the franchise, or the right to vote.
Democracy comes from [Ancient
Greece](https://www.thoughtco.com/democracy-then-and-now-111997) and
filtered to the West and the United States through such [Enlightenment
thinkers](https://www.thoughtco.com/key-thinkers-of-the-enlightenment-1221868)
as Jean-Jaques Rousseau and John Locke. The United States is a democracy
and a republic, meaning that the people speak through elected
representatives. At its start, American democracy was not universal:
Only white, adult (over 21), property-holding males could vote. The
14th, 15th, 19th and [26th
Amendments](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-26th-amendment-4157809)\--plus
a variety of civil rights acts\--finally made voting universal in the
20th century. For its first 150 years, the United States was concerned
with its own domestic problems\--constitutional interpretation, states
rights, slavery, expansion\--more than it was with world affairs. Then
the United States focused on pushing its way onto the world stage in an
era of imperialism. But [with World War I, the United States began
moving in a different direction. Much of President Woodrow Wilson\'s
proposal for a post-war Europe\--[the Fourteen
Points](https://www.thoughtco.com/world-war-i-the-fourteen-points-2361398)\--dealt
with \"national self-determination.\" That meant imperial powers like
France, Germany and Great Britain should divest themselves of their
empires, and former colonies should form their own governments. Wilson
intended for the United States to lead those newly independent nations
into democracies]{.underline}, but Americans were of a different mind.
After the carnage of the war, the public wanted only to retreat into
isolationism and let Europe work out its own problems. After World War
II, however, [the United States]{.underline} could no longer retreat
into isolationism. It [actively promoted democracy]{.underline}, but
that was often a hollow phrase that allowed the United States to counter
Communism with compliant governments around the globe. [Democracy
promotion continued after the [Cold
War](https://www.thoughtco.com/cold-war-timeline-1221188)]{.underline}.
President George W. Bush linked it to the post-9/11 invasions of
Afghanistan and Iraq. How Is Democracy Promoted? Of course, there are
ways of promoting democracy other than warfare. [The State
Department\'s]{.underline} website says that it [supports and promotes
democracy in a variety of areas: Strengthening democratic institutions,
Supporting civil society, Enhancing the rule of law and judicial
independence, Promoting political pluralism and free, fair electoral
processes, Protecting independent media, Promoting Internet freedom,
Promoting human rights for all, including women.]{.underline} The
programs above are funded and administered through the [State
Department](https://www.thoughtco.com/about-the-us-state-department-3319884)
and USAID. Pros and Cons of Democracy Promotion Proponents of [democracy
promotion]{.underline} say that it [creates stable environments, which
in turn fosters [strong
economies](https://www.thoughtco.com/measuring-the-size-of-the-economy-1146998).
In theory, the stronger a nation\'s economy and the more educated and
empowered its citizenry, the less it needs foreign aid. So, democracy
promotion and US foreign aid are creating strong nations around the
globe.]{.underline}

### Impact -- Climate

#### Hegemony key to force other countries to cooperate on climate change

**Graham 18** (David A. Graham, 6-25-2018, \"Can Anyone Fill the U.S.
Leadership Vacuum on Climate Change?,\" Atlantic,
https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/can-anyone-fill-the-us-leadership-vacuum-on-climate-change/563594/)

But the U.S.-global relationship flows the other way, too: [There are
times when the world needs the U.S., and the effort to slow climate
change is shaping up as one of those]{.underline}. Even discounting the
effect of U.S. emissions on the goal of limiting change to 2 degrees
Celsius, [**it's simply very hard for international agreements to
function without the U.S. behaving as the enforcer**.]{.underline} That
makes Paris an interesting test case for whether global agreements can
work with America withdrawing from the stage, and if so, whether anyone
else can step up. ["The absence of the U.S. at a political level is
visible.]{.underline} I was at the Conference of Parties in Bonn in
November and [the absence of the U.S. is absolutely felt,"]{.underline}
Todd Stern, the Obama administration's lead negotiator on Paris, said
Sunday at the Aspen Ideas Festival, hosted by the Aspen Institute and
The Atlantic. ["There's a lot of countries trying to pull back and
backslide and it wouldn't be happening the same way if the U.S. was
there."]{.underline} The biggest risk of U.S. withdrawal hasn't come to
fruition, Stern said: Other countries didn't pull out of the agreement
after the U.S. did---in fact, Syria joined in November, making the U.S.
the only country in the world that is opposed. Stern worries that
current levels of effort still aren't enough to make the 2 degree mark.
["If the U.S. is not in there, the likelihood that you're going to get
other countries doing their best is just reduced,"]{.underline} he said.
But despite the foot-dragging from some countries, the most important
players are all working to reduce carbon emissions, even as the U.S.
loosens restrictions domestically. "China is definitely pushing forward.
India, definitely pushing forward. They're doing that domestically,"
said Christiana Figueres, former longtime executive secretary UN
Framework Convention on Climate Change. The motives behind that aren't
always altruistic: China's leadership views clean technology as a huge
economic growth opportunity. China is an emerging superpower, and
pundits have long speculated that it could replace the U.S. as the
dominant force in international agreements. So far, however, that isn't
happening, Stern and Figueres said. They're making strides domestically,
but can't seem to translate that into leadership among other countries.
"It's hard for other countries to align their political message with
what is going on on the ground," she said. There's an irony to this. For
years, the rest of the world has often bridled at U.S. arrogance in
foreign policy. Now, other countries are asking for the U.S. to assert
its leadership at just the moment when the U.S. government is not only
retrenching, as the Obama administration did, but withdrawing
altogether. It turns out that [while American power has sometimes
bullied other countries into doing what they don't want, **it's also a
useful tool for forcing them to do the things they want to do but can't
on their own**.]{.underline} [Climate change will be a test for Trump's
isolationist vision and whether the world can find ways to work without
the U.S acting as muscle.]{.underline} It's unfortunate that the
experiment's stakes include the future of human life.

#### US leadership key to fighting climate change

**Allen 18** (John R. Allen, 12-14-2018, \"American climate leadership
without American government,\"
Brookings, <https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2018/12/14/american-climate-leadership-without-american-government/>)

Today, the 24th conference of parties gathering -- or COP 24 -- of the
UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has begun to conclude. As the
biggest climate change meeting since the signing of the Paris Agreement,
this is a significant moment in history, and one worth reflecting on,
particularly as United States leadership continues to recede on this
critical global issue. In no uncertain terms, [climate change is among
the greatest international challenges of our time. It has truly
strategic implications for the United States]{.underline} and its
allies, and its effects and manifestations are rising in intensity and
urgency by the day. [The economic, social and security effects of a
rapidly changing climate will be dramatic, and **in managing this
problem and mitigating its effects, the United States must showcase
strong, dedicated leadership**]{.underline} as the community of nations
works towards credible and lasting solutions. Yet, what does
"leadership" really mean for an issue as all-encompassing and
international in nature as climate change? Increasingly, and especially
here in the U.S., there's developed an important distinction between the
leadership that can be provided by a president or the federal
government, and the wider values-based leadership that a country can
deliver on major issues through the actions and efforts of businesses,
state and local government, NGOs, and every-day citizens. Climate change
is a leading example of this: where, through the collective leadership
of "everyone else," [**the United States is continuing to act as a force
for meaningful change despite the retrogressive thinking** and
recalcitrant behavior **of the current Administration** on this
issue.]{.underline} That's what I call "American leadership" -- or,
leadership defined by the values and norms that have made America the
greatest nation on the planet these many decades. And it doesn't require
the U.S. government, or, "U.S. leadership," to be effective. On climate
change, U.S. leadership has been intermittent at best. President H.W.
Bush and President Clinton both deeply embraced the climate challenge,
before President George W. Bush famously walked away from the Kyoto
Protocols in 2001. Towards the end of his Presidency, though, [President
Bush took important steps to generate international climate action, most
importantly through the creation of what was then known as the Major
Emitters Forum (now the Major Economies Forum) -- a collection of the
most important economies in the world. President Obama used this group
to generate the first important steps towards what later became the
Paris Climate Agreement.]{.underline} President Trump has reversed
course, deciding that the United States will withdraw from the agreement
in 2020 (absent major and highly unlikely re-negotiations). As the
global community gathered at the COP 24 climate summit, a meeting
Brookings scholars such as [Todd
Stern](https://www.brookings.edu/podcast-episode/priorities-for-climate-change-action-after-cop-24/),
[David
Victor](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2018/12/05/more-bad-news-on-the-global-warming-front/)
and [Samantha
Gross](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2018/11/29/around-the-halls-brookings-experts-on-what-to-watch-at-the-cop-24-climate-summit/)have
tracked extensively, and something the current Administration has
[chosen to
marginalize](http://time.com/5475293/trump-fossil-fuels-cop-24-katowice/),
this most recent shift in U.S. leadership is deeply troubling, both for
the nation and the world. This doesn't mean, however, that the [U.S.
is]{.underline} now irrelevant to the problem; in fact, it's [essential
-- and this is where American leadership comes in]{.underline}. [Though
the absence of U.S. governmental leadership from climate change is
deeply regrettable and the U.S. is, in fact, most impactful when its two
forms of leadership are harmonized, it's not the same as saying that
America is entirely absent from the picture. American carbon emissions
have, in fact, declined steadily over the last several years. Indeed,
America is the sixth fastest declining emitter in the
world]{.underline}, ahead of countries like Germany, Canada and Japan.
[That's less because of governmental action than it is because of
American leadership at work, to include the dynamism of the American
private sector, the actions taken by city and state leaders, and the
engaged efforts of philanthropies and civil society, as well as
universities and think tanks. These groups represent the bedrock of
American values and exceptionalism, and it's through them that [America
continues to
lead](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2018/02/22/a-modern-case-for-regional-collaboration/)
in spite of the actions of current U.S. political
leadership.]{.underline} Despite its abdication of leadership on climate
change, the Trump Administration's desire to claim any win as their own
is resulting in senior officials trying and failing to claim credit for
these limited successes from their fellow Americans. Recent
Administration claims linking their decision on Paris to substantial
carbon reduction successes are, in fact, specious. Indeed, [**the
success in U.S. carbon reductions came explicitly from the momentum of
the Obama** and previous administrations' efforts and continued
subnational efforts.]{.underline} Put differently, U.S. carbon
reductions have occurred despite the current Administration, not because
of it. And this, of course, says nothing about Trump Administration
efforts to [actively
downplay](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-administration-resists-global-climate-efforts-at-home-overseas/2018/12/09/b94a9ef0-fa41-11e8-863c-9e2f864d47e7_story.html?utm_term=.c43b633e0c5b)
key international climate reports, as well as those [generated by the
U.S.
government](https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/11/23/major-trump-administration-climate-report-says-damages-are-intensifying-across-country/?noredirect=on&tid=a_inl_manual&utm_term=.2d0d90492490)
itself. That's a reflection of the new realities of American leadership
in the world. Even if the U.S. federal government returns to a
scientifically grounded view on climate change, government action alone
will be insufficient to solve this problem. In fact, the same holds true
for solving most of the pressing problems of the 21st century, and
American leadership in this new era will have to adapt to be able to
mobilize new centers of power and new dynamics of decision-making --
especially as technology reshapes the boundaries of where governments
can and cannot shape public opinion. American leadership will have to
transcend bilateral reflexes and transactional relationships of 2018 to
pull in as wide a subset of the world's major actors as is feasible.

[Europeans]{.underline} prefer to [view themselves]{.underline} as sober
climate realists --- [as the world's most committed actors when it comes
to fighting climate change]{.underline}. They [pride themselves on
leading global treaties like the Paris accord]{.underline} and decry
Trump's announcement that America will pull out. So it's more than a
little ironic when **[the continent that seemed to be steering the
process is]{.underline}**, in fact, **[lagging badly behind
America]{.underline}** --- even as a climate change--denier occupies the
White House and dinosaur conservative lawmakers continue to ignore the
crisis and the policies required to deal with it. [Despite Trump's
reckless dismissal]{.underline} [of]{.underline} recent dire warnings
from the IPCC and 13 federal agencies predicting [the disastrous impacts
of accelerated climate change]{.underline} --- **[increased droughts,
fires, super storms and floods; mass crop failure and water scarcity,
and hundreds of millions of people displaced by rising
seas]{.underline}**; and projected costs of more than \$500 billion
annually to the U.S. economy alone --- [the U.S. managed to slash its
CO2 emissions by 42 million tons in 2016]{.underline}--'17. It was [the
largest cut of any nation]{.underline}. By contrast, in the same period,
the E.U. increased its CO2 emissions by 43 million tons --- the world's
fourth-highest rise, behind China (120 million tons), India (93 million
tons) and Turkey (45 million tons). From 2014 to 2017, U.S. emissions
fell by 5%, while E.U. emissions grew by 3%. Going back to the 1997
Kyoto protocol, and up until just a few years ago, Europe was considered
the boldest decision maker when it came to setting carbon-cutting goals;
as former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said in
2014: "No player in the world is as ambitious as the E.U." How did the
tables turn so quickly on Europe's clean energy leaders? It's certainly
not the result of climate-friendly policies advanced by team Trump or
the Republicans. Instead, it's economics, plain and simple: [American
utilities, investors and energy companies understood last decade that
coal no longer makes long-term financial sense due to price-competitive
alternatives]{.underline}, so [they jumped on the low-cost gas and
renewables train]{.underline} to move a greater share of the U.S.
economy toward cleaner power. [The country has since seen a raft of coal
plant closures and a flood of cheap gas and renewables enter the
market]{.underline}. Which is to say that emissions regulations didn't
drive the change --- money did. In the process, [the industry has saved
consumers money]{.underline}, lowered emissions [and laid the groundwork
for a more sustainable energy future.]{.underline} In 2017, we suggested
that Donald Trump could become an "accidental climate hero" thanks to
the rapid replacement of coal with renewables and gas. We didn't think
our prediction would bear out this quickly. But as [the U.S. climate
delegation]{.underline} [reveals]{.underline} its numbers this week in
Poland at COP24 --- a follow-up to the Paris accords --- [it will be
hard to argue against Trump's hands-off, free-market strategy that has
done more than Europe]{.underline}'s regulatory and subsidy framework
[to fight climate change]{.underline}. America's clean-energy transition
was already well underway when Trump took office; between 2014 and 2017,
34 Gigawatts of coal-fired power plants were retired, assisted though
not driven by Obama-era tax credits for wind and solar projects. Now, [a
record-breaking 16 Gigawatts of coal plants have been taken offline in
the U.S.]{.underline} this year alone, the equivalent of powering 12
million homes, while the country's overall coal power emissions have
fallen by one-third since 2010. The big question Europeans must now ask
is: Why aren't we doing the same? What is preventing Germany, for
instance, the world's former leader on renewable power, from shuttering
more coal facilities? Lost jobs (and the subsequent political
consequences) are one reason. Just look at the violent "yellow vest"
protests engulfing France, where President Emmanuel Macron was forced to
back down this week on a proposed fuel tax to combat climate change.
When it comes to reducing fossil fuel use, the public appears to prefer
the economic carrot over the regulatory stick. Cutting a deal on a
global carbon tax would be the best, most effective way to speed the
planet towards goals of reaching 100% renewables and limiting warming to
1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, as laid out in the Paris
accord. This kind of mechanism is needed, though it could raise energy
costs on consumers in the short-term and therefore be politically
damaging. But implementing the measure won't happen at COP24 because,
for one, the U.S. won't sign the deal --- and [without the U.S. on
board, China, India, the E.U. and others would face a competitive
disadvantage.]{.underline} So where do we go from here? **[E.U. and
world leaders would be advised to study the U.S. model that
has]{.underline}**, on its own economic merits, [**succeeded in slashing
CO2**.]{.underline} In the absence of a carbon tax, European climate
negotiators need to reckon with the fact that America, for all its
anti-climate bluster, has figured something out. **[It's in everyone's
interest to follow its lead.]{.underline}**

[The **US** has attempted to back its ideational leadership with
**structural leadership** by offering inducements to developing
countries in the form of funding for actions to **mitigate** and adapt
to **climate change**. The US, has for example, made recommendations for
financing adaptation, energy investment, and support for developing
countries by calling for \$100 billion a year to be collectively
mobilized by 2020]{.underline}. However, as Obama noted at the
Copenhagen heads-of-state meeting, to 'channel some of the resources
from our countries into developing countries' would be 'a very heavy
lift' without a 'sense of mutuality' (Rapp et al.

[The US came to COP15 in Copenhagen ready to commit to specific GHG
reduction targets. In Copenhagen, the US offered reductions in the range
of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020, with the ultimate goal of reducing
emissions 83% by 2050.]{.underline} The problem for the US was whether
[potential followers saw this as a **credible directional
leadership**]{.underline}. First, the selection of 2005 as a base year,
rather than the Kyoto Protocol's base year of 1990, means the US pledge
is less ambitious than what the EU has promised. Second, US GHGs
reduction goals, which the US made as part of its Copenhagen Accord
commitments and in its INDC prior to Paris, may be hard to achieve
without tailor-made legislation or strong regulations, which, due
congressional politics, would be extremely difficult to enact. However,
upon being reelected for a second term in 2012, after 2 years of virtual
silence, Obama, with his Climate Action Plan, relaunched an aggressive
policy program, relying primarily on executive action and the EPA's
regulatory power. In Warsaw and Lima, the US touted its domestic actions
and directional leadership credentials by reporting on its new
regulations in the power and transportation sectors, its investment in
clean energy and energy efficiency, its measures to reduce methane and
HFC emissions, and its progress in reducing GHG emissions (Stern

ease years of tensions over disputed islands in the South China Sea.

hegemony would work.]{.underline}** (Wikimedia Commons) The "nine-dash
line" describing Chinese claims to the South China Sea During a briefing
for officers from the 10-country Association of South East Asian
Nations, the chief of China's Southern Theater Command presented a map
including the "nine-dash line" border long used by Beijing to claim
dominion over nearly the entire South China Sea --- claims the ASEAN
members do not recognize. Despite an international tribunal declaring in
2016 that the nine-dash demarcation had "no legal basis" in
international law, the Chinese official insisted to his ASEAN
counterparts not only that the 9-dash line delineated Chinese
sovereignty, but that as head of Southern Theater Command, he was
responsible for enforcing those boundaries. According to U.S. officials,
the [ASEAN naval leaders were outraged]{.underline} --- though not
surprised --- [by]{.underline} what seemed like [a deliberately
insulting provocation by the Chinese. China]{.underline} has done much
more than talk, of course. It [has built seven artificial islands on
shallow reefs in the South China Sea, all in areas claimed by other
countries, and claimed exclusive maritime zones around them in
contradiction to international law.]{.underline} As recently as October,
a Chinese destroyer nearly collided with the USS Decatur as it was
conducting a routine "freedom of navigation" patrol in international
waters near the Spratly Islands, prompting Secretary of Defense Jim
Mattis to cancel a scheduled trip to China. Back in 2015, Chinese
President Xi [Jinping tried to calm regional nerves by publicly
promising not to "militarize" the man-made islands]{.underline}. Earlier
this year[, however, U.S. surveillance confirmed the islands now boast
military airstrips]{.underline} and facilities and are bristling with
anti-ship and surface-to-air (SAM) missiles. "What my predecessor called
a 'Great Wall of Sand' three years ago is now a 'Great Wall of SAMs,'
giving the People's Republic of China the ability to exert national
control over international water and airspace over which \$3 trillion in
goods travel every year," said Admiral Philip Davidson. (Davidson, new
head of the recently renamed U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, spoke last week
via video link to a CSIS conference on China). "[The PRC says it's
militarizing these islands in order to defend Chinese 'sovereignty,'
but]{.underline} [in doing so they are violating the sovereignty of
every other nation to fly, sail, trade and operate in accordance with
international law."]{.underline} CSIS image China's new airstrip built
over Fiery Cross Reef in the South China Sea (CSIS image) "The
[intensifying competition between the United States and China is not
just driven by the traditional power politics between an established
power and an emerging power]{.underline}, but rather I believe [we are
facing something much more serious]{.underline}," Davidson said, in some
of the most blunt and pointed rhetoric heard from a four-star theater
commander since the Cold War. "[I see a fundamental divergence of values
that leads to two incomparable visions of the future**. I think those
two incomparable visions are between China and the rules-based

conventional and nuclear deterrent that matched Soviet capabilities and

before the Trump administration initiated a trade war with China
involving hundreds of billions of dollars in punitive tariffs, there
were signs of a fundamental, strategic divergence that echoes the Cold
War. The U.S. had hoped that, by integrating China into a rules-based
international order, exposure to Western values and increasing economic
prosperity --- including a nine-fold increase in GDP since joining the
World Trade Organization in 2001 --- would moderate the Communist
Party's authoritarian and mercantilist impulses. But a growing number of
U.S. national security and foreign affairs experts have concluded that
**[the decades-old strategy of accommodation and engagement with China
has simply failed.]{.underline}** Chinese President Xi Jinping inspects
PLA troops Instead, [the party has used China's rapidly accumulating
power to crack down on dissent at home, bully its neighbors, and
challenge the United States in Asia and worldwide.]{.underline}
Engagement with the US has not stopped Beijing from persistently bending
the rules of international trade in service to China's voracious
mercantilism, erecting steep tariffs, forcing corporations to surrender
intellectual property or compromise their ethics for the privilege of
accessing the Chinese market, and outright stealing proprietary
technology from U.S. corporations through cyber espionage. Benefiting
from other countries' free markets has not stopped China from launching
a 10-year plan to use government subsidies, state-controlled firms, and
"military-civil fusion" between the armed forces and private companies
to pursue dominance in high-tech sectors from electric cars to
artificial intelligence. [Entering the global economy has not stopped

### Impact -- Econ

#### **US leadership good for the economy**

**Kagan and Daalder 16** (Robert Kagan and Ivo H. Daalder, 4-25-2016,
\"The U.S. can't afford to end its global leadership role,\" Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/04/25/the-u-s-cant-afford-to-end-its-global-leadership-role/)

The economic, political and security strategy that the United States has
pursued for more than seven decades, under Democratic and Republican
administrations alike, is today widely questioned by large segments of
the American public and is under attack by leading political candidates
in both parties. Many Americans no longer seem to value the liberal
international order that the United States created after World War II
and sustained throughout the Cold War and beyond. Or perhaps they take
it for granted and have lost sight of the essential role the United
States plays in supporting the international environment from which they
benefit greatly. The unprecedented prosperity made possible by [**free
and open markets** and thriving international trade; the spread of
democracy; and the avoidance of major conflict among great powers: All
these remarkable accomplishments **have depended on sustained U.S.
engagement around the world**.]{.underline} Yet politicians in both
parties dangle before the public the vision of an America freed from the
burdens of leadership. What these politicians don't say, perhaps because
they don't understand it themselves, is that [the price of ending our
engagement would far outweigh its costs. The international order created
by the United States today faces challenges greater than at any time
since the height of the Cold War. Rising authoritarian powers in Asia
and Europe threaten to undermine the security structures that have kept
the peace since World War II. Russia invaded Ukraine and has seized some
of its territory. In East Asia, an increasingly aggressive China seeks
to control the sea lanes through which a large share of global commerce
flows.]{.underline} [In the Middle East, Iran pursues hegemony by
supporting Hezbollah and Hamas and the bloody tyranny in
Syria.]{.underline} The Islamic State controls [more
territory](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/04/islamic-state-now-controls-resources-and-territory-unmatched-in-history-of-extremist-organizations/)
than any terrorist group in history, brutally imposing its extreme
vision of Islam and striking at targets throughout the Middle East,
North Africa and Europe. [None of these threats will simply go
away.]{.underline} Nor will the United States be spared if the
international order collapses, as it did twice in the 20th century. In
the 21st century, oceans provide no security. Nor do walls along
borders. Nor would cutting off the United States from the international
economy by trashing trade agreements and erecting barriers to commerce.
In the 21st century, oceans provide no security. Nor do walls along
borders. Nor would cutting off the United States from the international

[Instead of following the irresponsible counsel of demagogues, we need
to]{.underline} restore a bipartisan foreign policy consensus around
[renew]{.underline}ing [U.S. global leadership. Despite predictions of a
"post-American world," U.S. capacities remain considerable. **The U.S.
economy remains the most dynamic in the world**. The widely touted "rise
of the rest"]{.underline}---the idea that the United States was being
overtaken by the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China---[has
proved to be a myth. The **dollar remains the world's reserve
currency**, and people across the globe seek U.S. investment and
entrepreneurial skills to help their flagging economies. U.S.
institutions of higher learning remain the world's best and attract
students from every corner of the globe. The political values that the
United States stands for remain potent forces for change. Even at a time
of resurgent autocracy, popular demands for greater freedom can be heard
in Russia, China, Iran and elsewhere, and those peoples look to the
United States for support, both moral and material.]{.underline} And our
strategic position remains strong. The United States has more than 50
allies and partners around the world. Russia and China between them have
no more than a handful. [The task ahead is to]{.underline} play on these
strengths and [provide the kind of leadership that many around the world
seek and that]{.underline} the [American]{.underline} public [can
support.]{.underline} For the past two years, under the auspices of the
World Economic Forum, we have worked with a diverse, bipartisan group of
Americans and representatives from other countries to put together [the
broad outlines of a strategy for renewed U.S.
leadership](https://www.brookings.edu/research/strengthening-the-liberal-world-order/).
There is nothing magical about our proposals. The strategies to sustain
the present international order are much the same as the strategies that
created it. But they need to be adapted and updated to meet new
challenges and take advantage of new opportunities. The widely touted
"rise of the rest"---the idea that the United States was being overtaken
by the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China---has proved to be a
myth. For instance, one prime task today is to strengthen the
international economy, from which the American people derive so many
benefits. This means passing trade agreements that strengthen ties
between the United States and the vast economies of East Asia and
Europe. [Contrary to what demagogues in both parties claim, ordinary
Americans stand to gain significantly from the recently negotiated
Trans-Pacific Partnership. According to the Peterson Institute for
International Economics, the agreement will increase annual real incomes
in the United States by [\$131
billion](http://www.iie.com/publications/interstitial.cfm?ResearchID=2906).]{.underline}
[The United States]{.underline} also [needs to work to reform existing
international institutions]{.underline}, such as the International
Monetary Fund, [so that rising economic powers]{.underline} such as
China [feel a greater stake in them,]{.underline} while also working
with new institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
to ensure that they reinforce rather than undermine liberal economic
norms. [The revolution in energy, which has made the United States one
of the world's leading suppliers, offers another powerful
advantage]{.underline}. With the right mix of policies, the United
States could help allies in Europe and Asia diversify their sources of
supply and thus reduce their vulnerability to Russian manipulation.
Nations such as Russia and Iran that rely heavily on hydrocarbon exports
would be weakened, as would the OPEC oil cartel. The overall result
would be a relative increase in our power and ability to sustain the
order. [The world has come to recognize that education, creativity and
innovation are key to prosperity, and most see the United States as a
leader in these areas. **Other nations want access to the American
market, American finance and American innovation**. Businesspeople
around the world seek to build up their own Silicon Valleys and other
U.S.-style centers of entrepreneurship. The U.S. government
can]{.underline} do a better job of [work]{.underline}ing [with the
private sector in collaborating with developing countries]{.underline}.
And Americans need to be more, not less, welcoming to immigrants.
Students studying at our world-class universities, entrepreneurs
innovating in our high-tech incubators and immigrants searching for new
opportunities for their families strengthen the United States and show
the world the opportunities offered by democracy. Americans need to be
reminded what is at stake. Finally, the United States needs to do more
to reassure allies that it will be there to back them up if they face
aggression. Would-be adversaries need to know that they would do better
by integrating themselves into the present international order than by
trying to undermine it. Accomplishing this, however, requires ending
budget sequestration and increasing spending on defense and on all the
other tools of international affairs. This investment would be more than
paid for by the global security it would provide. All these efforts are
interrelated, and, indeed, a key task for responsible political leaders
will be to show how the pieces fit together: how trade enhances
security, how military power undergirds prosperity and how providing
access to American education strengthens the forces dedicated to a more
open and freer world. Above all, Americans need to be reminded what is
at stake. [Many millions around the world have benefited from an
international order that has raised standards of living, opened
political systems and preserved the general peace.]{.underline} But no
nation and no people have benefited more than Americans. And [no nation
has a greater role to play in preserving this system for future
generations.]{.underline}

#### US leadership key to the economy

**Kyl 15** (Jon Kyl, 12-3-2015, \"What to Do: Policy Recommendations on
American Internationalism,\" AEI,
http://www.aei.org/publication/why-american-leadership-still-matters/)

[In the wake of the Great Depression and World War II, America's leaders
recognized that financial stability and growth elsewhere improved
domestic economic conditions and, likewise, that economic crises
elsewhere harmed US growth]{.underline}. America's role in the postwar
world reflected an understanding that it would be impossible for the
United States to isolate itself from events happening elsewhere in the
world. America's leaders came to a consensus: it was far more beneficial
to engage with the world than to try to insulate the country from
developments abroad. The United States, then, came to exercise global
leadership in pursuit of the safety, security, and prosperity of its own
citizenry, which would in turn undergird peace, security, and economic
growth abroad. [In the decades that followed, America exercised its
leadership to underpin and shape globalization in a manner that ensured
economic prosperity both at home and abroad. This international economic
system, which could not have been created without America, has been
responsible for lifting nearly a billion of people out of poverty at a
pace never before seen]{.underline}.\[17\] The consensus that drove this
approach is now eroding, but the reasoning behind it is as applicable
today as it was 75 years ago. Today, [the American economy is
increasingly integrated with other economies, and its vibrancy relies on
foreign trade and investment as well as inflows of capital to the United
States. American leadership through the support of an open, rules-based
and nondiscriminatory international system]{.underline}---one that
encourages growth, flows of people, ideas, investments, and
trade---[remains key to ensuring that globalization continues to
increase economic welfare both at home and abroad.]{.underline} Even
without active US leadership, companies will continue investing
overseas, businesses will continue trading with foreign partners, and
students will continue studying abroad. But [the absence of US
leadership will likely result in American businesses, workers, and
families confronting a world where competition is less fair and less
free---a world that is more protectionist, less friendly, less
democratic, less safe, and ultimately less conducive to the furtherance
of overall US and global prosperity and security.]{.underline} An
eroding consensus Some Americans now question whether the cost of
international engagement is worth the benefits. This reflects weariness
with overseas wars and entanglements that have yielded ambiguous
results.\[18\] The international economic order that the United States
has built and continues to support has created the conditions that have
allowed the growth of countries worldwide, including Japan, China,
India, and Brazil. Yet some of these countries want to play outside the
rules that ensure an open, nondiscriminatory system. Many in the United
States have also struggled to adjust to the challenges brought on by
globalization. As a result, the US is seen as no longer realizing gains
from globalization, and even if it were, the gains are insufficient to
justify continued US leadership. This raises the question of whether the
US should continue to exercise leadership, and if so, how it should
proceed. Others view globalization as continuing to work to America's
advantage and believe that ongoing US leadership is essential for
sustaining the existing system. According to this view, rules-based free
trade necessarily increases US and global welfare, and the costs to
particular industries and their workers need to be managed with
appropriate domestic policies. This group supports strong enforcement of
trade obligations but also emphasizes long-term trade liberalization
goals over individual lapses in compliance. Still others support
deepening flows of trade, investments, people, and ideas but see new
challenges for the US from globalization, including a lack of
willingness of other countries to share in the benefits and burdens of
maintaining the system. While presenting a different conclusion from the
isolationists on how to address these issues, this view grapples with
many of the same concerns---such as whether the current framework for
globalization can address challenges such as large-scale intellectual
property (IP) theft, economic cybertheft, and currency manipulation that
harms American workers. Ongoing US economic leadership Addressing the
continuing leadership role of the US in the global economy raises the
question of the nation's capacity to continue to lead. Consider a few
facts: [The United States remains the world's largest economy and is
almost twice as large as China's, the world's second-largest
economy]{.underline}.\[19\] [The US economy is also one of the most
innovative, with the world's top universities and research institutions.
It attracts talent from around the globe. The US dollar is, by the
choice of central banks, the world's reserve currency and is the most
commonly used medium for global trade and investment. The dollar is also
the world's safe-haven currency]{.underline}---American Treasury
securities remain the investment of choice for foreign individuals,
institutions, and governments during periods of volatility---[reflecting
a global view of the stability and solvency of the US
government]{.underline}. In the words of one leading economist, "There
is no viable challenger to the dollar's status as the definitive safe
haven currency."\[20\] Unless and until these facts cease to be true,
the United States will maintain the power and capacity to shape the
terms of the global economy. [The ability of the US to exercise global
economic leadership is also linked to America's capacity to provide
global security.]{.underline} The United States provides a global
security umbrella that has fostered the growth of cross-border trade and
investment.\[21\] The size of the US military, along with America's
structure of alliances and overseas bases, has supported American
efforts to ensure the security of the global commons, which is vital to
the free movement of goods and capital. [Nearly 60 percent of the
world's seaborne oil, to reference one oft-cited and important example,
passes through the Straits of Malacca and of Hormuz, and for decades the
presence of the US Navy has ensured that they remain open for global
commerce.\[]{.underline}22\] Going forward, the ability of the US to
sustain this military strength is inextricably linked to the strength of
the American economy, so better leveraging security relationships to
achieve freer trade will be crucial. From this perspective, an
international economic system that expands US opportunities for growth
will also underpin the ongoing ability of the US to exercise global
leadership. Although the capacity of the United States to lead in the
international economic realm is clear, many still question whether it
makes sense for the United States to do so. Just because the United
States can lead does not necessarily mean that it should. Yet a closer
examination of the unique role that America plays in the international
economy shows that engagement remains as vital to prosperity at home and
abroad today as at any other time in US history. Why US international
economic leadership remains vital In a world where many countries are
not inclined to promote free markets or ensure the integrity of the
trade and financial system, [US leadership is crucial to ensure that
globalization continues to evolve in ways that suit US and broader
global interests. The fact is that America's leadership continues to
shape the international economic system to the advantage of Americans
and foreign countries alike. American Leadership Ensures a
Nondiscriminatory, Open, and Rules-Based System]{.underline}. Global
growth is not only creating tremendous opportunities for American
businesses, traders, and entrepreneurs, but it is also creating
challenges. Currently, 95 percent of the world's population lives
outside the United States.\[23\] Global middle-class consumer demand is
projected to grow from \$21 trillion in 2009 to more than \$56 trillion
in 2030, with most of the growth occurring abroad.\[24\] As other
economies develop, American businesses will face increased competition
overseas, but this will also present myriad new opportunities for
American businesses to enter new and fast-growing markets. To take
advantage of these opportunities, it behooves America to ensure that the
international economic system is open, nondiscriminatory, and rules
based. Under such conditions, American businesses, traders, and
entrepreneurs can compete and fully realize the opportunities presented
by globalization. [Through its leadership in developing and maintaining
a rules-based international economic system, the US has ensured that
international norms of economic engagement are broadly consistent with
US values. The United States was instrumental in the creation of
international economic organizations such as the World Trade
Organization]{.underline} (WTO), [the International Monetary
Fund]{.underline} (IMF), [and the World Bank and remains a crucial
participant in their operations]{.underline}. [These
organizations]{.underline}, along with a web of international trade and
investment agreements, [provide stability and increase certainty,
reducing the risks for traders and investors engaging in international
economic activity]{.underline}. For instance, government expropriation
of a foreigner's investment without full compensation is now a broadly
accepted principle, if not a rule. [The existence of these norms
facilitates international commerce and has also aided in the growth of
America's domestic economy. Institutions like the IMF and the World Bank
are not beyond criticism, and the United States should play a greater
leadership role in their reform.]{.underline} But, overall, the
existence of this framework has been a vital tool for US economic and
broader national interests. [American Leadership Strengthens Global
Value Chains.]{.underline} [Continued American economic leadership
ensures that American businesses and workers can compete effectively in
a global economic system that looks quite different than it did just two
short decades ago]{.underline}. In the past, goods were largely
manufactured in one country before being exported to foreign markets.
This is no longer the case: components of complex goods are frequently
manufactured in a number of countries, assembled by workers in another,
and marketed and designed by workers in yet another country. [The rise
of these global value chains requires that individual countries have
secure and cost-effective access to exports and imports. It is
especially important for America to maintain this access: many goods and
services pass through several countries before being sold to end users,
and American companies do much of the high-value-added
work]{.underline}.\[25\] America may import assembled high-tech goods
from abroad, but much of the research and development, design work, and
technologically advanced inputs typically originate in the United
States. For American companies to take full advantage of global value
chains, other countries must lower their trade barriers, reduce customs
delays, and provide access for global carrier services that can move
goods quickly and cost-effectively. These policies align with the
interests of American consumers and workers alike, and the US is
uniquely positioned to champion them. [American Leadership Maximizes the
Opportunities Created by the Internet's Expanding Role in International
Commerce.]{.underline} The Internet is creating new opportunities for
business of all sizes, including small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs), to engage in the global economy. Internet platforms allow small
companies easier access to foreign consumers. [The Internet is also
giving businesses access to cheaper communications platforms and other
technologies that increase a company's productivity and ability to
compete domestically and overseas. At the same time, some governments
are seeking to restrict the free flow of data and access to the
Internet. These policies include banning access to certain foreign sites
and giving domestic businesses commercial preferences and advantages in
cyberspace.\[]{.underline}26\] [US leadership is crucial to maintaining
the openness of the Internet and the free flow of data
globally]{.underline}---the equivalent to sea lanes in the 21st century.
[American Leadership Facilitates Open Global Capital
Markets.]{.underline} The benefits of American leadership extend beyond
the realm of international trade. [American leadership has also ensured
that global capital markets develop in ways that benefit the US
economy]{.underline}. The free flow of capital underpins the capacity of
American businesses to pursue investment opportunities across the globe.
The US has also received significant amounts of inward foreign
investment, which has produced economic benefits for the US economy and
its workers.\[27\] Many countries, however, still maintain policies that
create barriers to foreign investment. The ability to move capital
globally has also allowed multinational corporations to take advantage
of international differences in corporate tax rates and structures to
reduce the amount of taxes paid in their home countries. Significant tax
and foreign investment policy reforms, both in America and in other
countries, may be needed to address these issues. [International
financial markets also benefit from American leadership. As the global
financial crisis made clear, unevenness in regulatory measures, such as
accounting, leverage standards, and supervision methodologies, within
and across borders exacerbated the situation and delayed the recovery.
The US has since moved more quickly than most other nations to address
problems the crisis uncovered]{.underline}. For example, US bank
regulators introduced "stress tests" for capital positions and
encouraged large US banks to adopt global capital standards such as
Basel III well ahead of the international schedule. Even in the wake the
worst crisis to affect international financial markets in generations,
American responses have set the standard for international recovery
efforts and the stability of the global financial system. American
Leadership in the International Economic Realm Supports Other Foreign
Policy Goals[. US capacity to exercise global economic leadership
represents a powerful tool to achieve national security goals. The size
of the US market and the importance of its banking and financial system
allows it to, in many cases, impose effective trade and financial
sanctions and to persuade other countries to take similar measures both
through the UN Security Council and through bilateral and multilateral
agreements to enhance global security.]{.underline} In addition, [the US
has effectively used its economic power to further the global adoption
of and adherence to norms of behavior in areas such as democracy, human
rights, and environmental protection.]{.underline} Important US laws
with extraterritorial reach, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,
have also been instrumental in preventing corruption and protecting the
rule of law globally.

#### US leadership is key to the use of US dollars -- dollars are important to the foundation of the economy

**Smart 18** (Christopher Smart, 12-16-2018, \"The Future of the
Dollar---and Its Role in Financial Diplomacy,\" Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace,
https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/12/16/future-of-dollar-and-its-role-in-financial-diplomacy-pub-77986
)

[The dollar's central role in world financial markets reflects both
faith in American leadership and the absence of reasonable
alternatives.]{.underline} [Currency dominance has also been a linchpin
in America's efforts to shape a global order around free markets and
democracy while serving as a foundation for the sustained growth of a
more integrated global economy.]{.underline} These roles now face rising
risks. Both Republicans and Democrats question the benefits of an open
and integrated economic order that seems to drain good jobs and demand
repeated bailouts of bad banks and corrupt foreign governments.
Meanwhile, allies and rivals alike raise doubts about the durability of
U.S. leadership and the wisdom of depending so heavily on one dominant
power. Such talk hardly portends imminent financial collapse or
reconfiguration of the global order. [America's military and political
strength remain paramount and investors still retreat to dollars
whenever risks mount]{.underline}---even when those risks originate in
the United States itself. Nevertheless, signs of an unravelling
consensus are unmistakable. They lie not in the declining percentages of
U.S. currency held in sovereign reserves, but rather the weakening faith
in America's ability to hold the system together. The clues are in the
early elements of financial plumbing that bypass dollar markets,
international financial institutions without active U.S. participation
and increasingly rudderless economic gatherings of finance ministers.
[The risks for the existing global order are not that another power will
displace Washington on these issues, but that there will be no
leadership in areas that have become increasingly important to global
commerce. Worse, the response to the next financial crisis will be
uncoordinated and disastrous.]{.underline} The U.S. midterm elections
have triggered some renewed debate about America's global agenda, yet
there have been few voices to remind voters that international financial
leadership benefits Americans and not just America's banks. In fact,
global dependence on access to the dollar gives Washington leverage to
coordinate battles against terrorism and cybercrime, to shape rules
against corruption and tax avoidance, and to protect privacy through the
regulation of global data flows that will drive the next decades of
economic innovation. Meanwhile, the United States must also build on
summit communiques to make concrete progress in these areas with
skeptical allies and rivals. For all its fits and starts, [U.S.
leadership continues to provide a crucial global framework for strong,
sustainable and balanced growth]{.underline}. Yet faith in the dollar
will only endure with a sense that the United States' role has evolved
from chief executive to managing partner that champions the integrity of
a global financial system along with its own interests. The fundamental
choice to transact, invest or save in dollars reflects a judgement that
they are most useful for those purposes. These judgements are slow and
cumulative, but the choices can shift surprisingly and decisively. In
many ways, the dollar emerged later than it should have, but perhaps
sooner than expected. The U.S. economy surpassed Britain's in the 1870s
and was a larger exporter by the First World War. Yet the dollar first
gained preeminence in bond markets by 1929, only to cede leadership back
to sterling with the Great Depression. [The end of the Second World War
left the United States paramount with victorious armed forces, an
unmatched economy and a network of global interests. In the decades
since then, however, the dollar has endured the end of gold
convertibility, inflationary fevers, expanding trade gaps, ballooning
fiscal deficits, intermittent government shutdowns, a global financial
crisis and even the loss of the U.S. Triple-A bond rating. Foreign firms
use dollars because their customers, suppliers and competitors
do]{.underline}. In one survey by Harvard economics professor Gita
Gopinath, now the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) chief economist,
the share of global trade invoiced in dollars is more than three times
the U.S. share of global exports. Foreign governments accumulate dollars
in reserves because they like to manage their own exchange rate against
the world's major trading currency. According to the IMF, the dollar
still represents roughly 62 percent of all sovereign reserves, with the
euro at 20 percent and the renminbi still accounting for less than 2
percent even though its share in global trade and finance is rising.
Finally, investors favor dollars in part because firms and governments
do, but also because the dollar markets are the deepest and most
sophisticated, which makes them likely to be less expensive to tap for
loans and more likely to deliver a reliable return. [The economic
tradeoffs for the United States are clear. Issuing the world's reserve
currency offers the prospect to literally print money everyone accepts
to buy guns without giving up butter. The dollar's dominance also allows
the United States to delay or shift any costs of global adjustment to
other countries. Another benefit, the United States pockets the
"seigniorage" income from what are effectively no-interest loans from
the foreigners who hold two-thirds of the \$100 bills in circulation.
Among the costs, America's easy access to low-cost credit may contribute
to a stronger exchange rate that hurts exports and makes fiscal and
trade deficits larger. **Washington also bears responsibility to provide
dollars and safe assets in a crisis.**]{.underline} Some of [the
dollar's durability comes from the absence of viable
alternatives.]{.underline} Europe's common currency was a political
project to bind the continent after centuries of war, although a clear
aspiration of some European leaders has been to create a counterweight
to dollar dominance. Yet the European financial crisis fragmented its
financial markets and triggered questions about the viability of the
European project itself. Postwar Japan deliberately protected the yen
from an international role so that domestic capital could be directed
for domestic purposes and the exchange rate could be managed. More
recently, Japanese economic woes and competition from China have
proscribed any real role for the yen, which remains at roughly 4.5
percent of international reserves. Chinese officials have a clear aim to
expand the role of the renminbi in global trade, finance and sovereign
reserves. For example, foreign governments have issued debt and central
banks have established swap lines in Chinese currency. Even the likes of
Germany and Chile have added it to the mix of their global reserves. Yet
for now the reach of China's currency remains restricted. Even if there
is no economic crisis that interrupts more than two decades of
blistering growth and reforms open the capital account and exchange
rate, China's domestic financial markets are not deep or liquid enough
to absorb vast global flows. [Ultimately, these require fundamental
reforms in corporate governance, regulatory transparency and a system of
checks and balances that a government can trust.]{.underline} Even the
nineteenth century Rothschilds preferred lending money to constitutional
monarchs, whom they considered better credit risks than unconstrained
absolute monarchs. "[Great powers have great currencies,"]{.underline}
wrote the Nobel Laureate Robert Mundell, and [it seems uncontroversial
that global influence and global money are intertwined]{.underline}.
Indeed, if the military strength and economic wealth of the United
States underpin the dollar's central role, [America's global influence
is enhanced because its currency dominates trade, finance and sovereign
reserves.]{.underline} In the extreme, the United States has been known
to leverage its military strength on behalf of economic interests---and
indeed, the dollar itself. At different times, for example, Japan,
Germany and Saudi Arabia have been reminded that U.S. security
guarantees warranted their financial support when the dollar came under
strain. Alternatively, during the Suez Crisis, the dollar's dominance
allowed the United States to force a British military withdrawal under
threat of triggering a run on sterling. Yet much [**of the dollar's
influence stems directly from the prestige of America's institutions**
and trust in its intentions. Military and economic power support the
dollar's dominant share of trade and investment, but **faith in U.S.
political institutions has bolstered its role as both a reserve currency
and a safe haven.**]{.underline} In a world of imperfect choices, [other
countries have come to rely on the U.S. record of building rules-based
financial institutions, proposing agendas for policy coordination and
shaping progress toward open markets.]{.underline} This has been the
story of the postwar Bretton Woods institutions, U.S. engagement in debt
relief negotiations and the response to financial crises. Meanwhile,
currency power ultimately depends on trust in the intentions of the
issuer. The issuer's interests may naturally come first, but its [usage
will grow if these interests are essentially aligned with shared goals
of global growth and stability.]{.underline} The most important economic
conferences of the twentieth century convened military and political
allies for difficult negotiations around monetary and financial policy.
How much more difficult will these discussions become with strategic
rivals around the table? How eager will China or Russia be to cooperate
when the G20 leaders next convene to address a global crisis? The United
States put its own interests first long before the Trump administration,
but it has generally interpreted this to include the construction of
global financial rules and institutions that apply to all. The growing
concerns among allies and rivals are the doubts of bank customers who
have been told that all fees have been raised because management needs
to prioritize shareholders first. The statement may be technically
correct, but it's a questionable business strategy. At a moment when
other economic powers continue to emerge, these agreed rules and shared
constraints become all the more important to protect U.S. interests.
Amid accelerating political and technological change, they become more

#### Rise of revisionist powers like Russia & China means American hegemony is [especially]{.underline} key -- lack of a response only [emboldens]{.underline} aggression

The lessons of World War II and the Cold War were too easily transmuted
into the argument that our security policies must always be undergirded
by morality. Today, we place more emphasis on the unquestioned evil of
both Nazism and Communism than on the existential threat their power
posed to Western civilization. It follows that [for defenders of
the]{.underline} supposed ["liberal international order," U.S.
involvement in humanitarian crises or efforts at
nation-building]{.underline} in inhospitable climates [becomes the true
measure of the legitimacy and wisdom of our foreign policy]{.underline}.
**[When liberal states reveal their hypocrisy by not intervening in such
crises, this delegitimizes them, and thereby makes it harder to advance
arguments based on real national interests]{.underline}**. The greatest
risk of all is that, [when do-gooding dominates policy,]{.underline} the
[American people are more likely to withdraw their support for defending
our overseas interests]{.underline}. The path to a sustainable and
strong U.S. role in the world does not rest in valorizing the
"rules-based international order": it rests in understanding the value
and the limits of our power. [Believe what you will about Iraq or
Syria]{.underline}. The fact is that [there is no public support for
such interventions today]{.underline}. It would be an act of folly to
press for actions that, for lack of that support, cannot be followed
through to victory. It must be an ironclad rule for the United States
that we do not start a fight we do not intend to finish. But [this does
not mean we give up the competitive struggle]{.underline}. Instead, [we
must find new ways to wage it]{.underline}. While we should not use our
national strength to uphold a fictive international community, we should
recognize that [our interests rest in advancing towards a freer
world]{.underline}. Thus, our goal has not changed: it is to help
defend, and, where possible, to advance prudently towards [a world built
on sovereign democracies in which Americans can be safe and
free]{.underline}. And the American constitutional order---if we keep
faith with it---has great long-run strengths, which we can use in this
struggle; it imposes limits on centralized power and the competition it
encourages. Principle and prudence alike tell us that we must play the
long game. [Our method should not be imposed regime change]{.underline},
except in cases of vital national need: [it should be the creation of
leverage, the use of pressure, and the imposition of costs to constrain
our opponents]{.underline}. It is a great mistake to believe that we
must always meet our adversaries head on: [for example, the U.S.
development of hydraulic fracturing, which]{.underline} reduces world
oil prices and thus [damages the Russian economy, imposes costs on
Russia and decreases its strategic influence. Our goal should be
to]{.underline} seek out and [use such indirect methods to encourage the
buildup of opposing forces]{.underline} within other systems,
[and]{.underline}---as Ronald Reagan did---[to build opportunities for
negotiations to be conducted on our terms]{.underline}, not theirs. And
at times, in part **[with the aid of this strategy, change may come in
another way, preferably through peaceful transitions]{.underline}** that
reflect a change in culture, and not just a struggle for power. Such a
failure to change the culture is why there was no revolution after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, but rather the more efficient
reorganization of power by a repressive clique. Yet autocracies are
brittle: eventually they crack, especially when the people living under
them seek to emulate more successful democracies. That is the great fear
of the Chinese Communist Party and the reason why it is repressing civil
society today. [We can win this struggle not primarily through force of
arms, but through persistence and flexibility]{.underline}, backed by
strength and the preservation of our national power. **[The greatest
strategic challenge we face today is not the strength of our main
adversaries: it is the weakness of their neighbors]{.underline}**, be
they [the]{.underline} smaller and still-[developing nations of
Southeast Asia vis-à-vis **China**]{.underline}, [or the
economically]{.underline} challenged [and militarily weak nations of
Europe facing **Russia**]{.underline}. [By various means---hybrid war,
political subversion, or fear]{.underline} induced by threats---[these
nations]{.underline}, some of them our allies, [are being suborned in
ways that we find hard to combat]{.underline} and are reluctant even to
acknowledge**[. A world divided up into spheres of influence, largely
controlled by our adversaries, would be neither stable nor
free.]{.underline}** While we cannot prevent powerful nations from
having spheres of particular interest, **[it is not in our interest to
allow them to exercise neo-imperial control over their
neighbors.]{.underline}** We are by instinct and by interest opposed to
empires. [If illiberal states dominate vital regions]{.underline}, such
as East Asia or Central Europe, the result will not be good for the
freedom of Americans in the world, or the idea of republican
self-government, or for our relative power[. It would thus be profoundly
antithetical to the true purpose of our foreign policy.]{.underline} So
[we must]{.underline} also [draw the line]{.underline} in two crucial
areas. [First, no great power has the right to seize disputed
territory]{.underline} by force of arms or stealthy annexation: [the
United States,]{.underline} together with as many allies as it can
muster, [must deter such seizures]{.underline} if possible, and, if
necessary, use all means, including its military, to restore the status
quo by imposing costs on an occupying power. [Second]{.underline}, [the
United States must support sovereign nations that are resisting
attempted subjugation]{.underline} by outside pressure, if that pressure
is exerted by a nation that has the strength to alter the global balance
of power. This means that we must oppose actions such as Russia's
assaults in Ukraine and the Caucasus, and China's expansionism in the
South China Sea. We cannot rule out the use of military force in cases
such as this: if we do, other powers will simply escalate in any crisis
until we quit. But [there are many ways to use our military, including
to deter]{.underline}, among other things. The **[crises in Ukraine and
the South China Sea reflect a U.S.]{.underline}** and allied **[failure
to establish credible deterrence.]{.underline}** Our military can also
be a cost-imposing instrument: [even if we never fire a shot, we can use
it to force the other side to respond in ways that impose
disproportionate costs]{.underline} on it. But the most important fact
for us to recognize is that crises of this sort never stand alone; they
are always part of a larger strategic competition. This means that **[we
cannot limit ourselves to symmetric responses.]{.underline}** Or, to put
it more concretely, [just because Russia attacks Ukraine does not mean
that our response should be limited to Ukraine.]{.underline} To limit
ourselves to a single theater of our opponent's choosing gives them the
initiative, denies the larger competition, and reduces our ability to
make full use of all the means---military, economic, and diplomatic---at
our disposal. And since the United States has a wider range of possible
responses than any other power in the world, we only hurt ourselves if
we artificially narrow the field of competition to a single disputed
region. In other words, it is an error to believe that our goal is
simply, and narrowly, to restore the status quo ante in particular, in
disputed areas of the world. Our goal is much broader: it is to win. Or,
more subtly, it is to engage in competition in ways that improve our
position and damage those of our competitors. It is therefore not right
to criticize responses---such as the sanctions that the United States
imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine---by arguing that they
did not resolve the crisis, for the point of such responses is not to
resolve the crisis: it is to open another front in the wider
competition, and to do so in ways that impose long-term costs on our
opponent. I[n time, the weakness of their system, and the stresses
created by our responses, will]{.underline} create opportunities to
[resolve particular crises]{.underline}---[but it is foolish to expect
quick results, or to draw up elaborate plans for how we will
win.]{.underline} After all, it took fifty years for the United States
to redeem the Baltic nations from the Soviet Union, and no one could
have foreseen the outcome of the Cold War in 1939. That is not to argue
that all U.S. crisis responses are beyond criticism, or that they will
inevitably be successful in the long run. But it is to argue that [we
are usually at fault,]{.underline} not simply in our response, but [in
failing to recognize and engage in the wider competition.]{.underline}
In other words, [the problem with U.S. sanctions on Russia
is]{.underline} not that they have not produced immediate results: it is
[that sanctions are a way of isolating the crisis into a single theatre
and, at the same time, disguising the wider
competition]{.underline}---above all, from ourselves. The danger of
these [**crises**]{.underline} is not that they pose a direct threat to
the United States. It is that, if **[driven by great powers, they are
central to the competitive world of geopolitics, and can even come to
define an era]{.underline}**. Not all crises are our business, but **[we
cannot allow powerful nations to believe that they can redivide the
world without reference to the values and interests of the United
States.]{.underline}** The **[danger rests]{.underline}** not so much in
any particular crisis, **[but in the rise of the belief among the
powerful that the world is there for taking]{.underline}**. As Winston
Churchill put it in 1935, in response to the Italian invasion of
Abyssinia, "It's not the thing we object to . . . it's the kind of
thing." Because the powerful and ill-intentioned learn from each other,
we are perilously close today to a world in which this "kind of thing"
becomes the way things are done.

#### American hard power is necessary to deter rising revisionist powers like Russia, China, and Iran that are creating [regional instability]{.underline}

[The quarter century following the Cold War was the most
peaceful]{.underline} in modern history. The world's strongest powers
did not fight one another or even think much about doing so. They did
not, on the whole, prepare for war, anticipate war, or conduct
negotiations and political maneuvers with the prospect of war looming in
the background. [As U.S. global military hegemony persisted, the
possibility of developed nations fighting one another seemed ever more
remote]{.underline}. [Then history began to change course]{.underline}.
In the last several years, [three powers have launched active efforts to
revise security arrangements in their]{.underline} respective
[regions]{.underline}. [Russia has invaded Crimea]{.underline} and other
parts of Ukraine [and has tried covertly to destabilize European
democracies]{.underline}. [China has built artificial island
fortresses]{.underline} [in international waters, claimed vast swaths of
the western Pacific, and moved to organize Eurasia
economically]{.underline} in ways favorable to Beijing.
[And]{.underline} the Islamic Republic of [Iran]{.underline} has
expanded its influence over much of Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen and
[is pursuing nuclear weapons.]{.underline} Stay informed. In-depth
analysis delivered weekly. [This]{.underline} new world [requires a new
American foreign policy]{.underline}. Fortunately, the country's own
not-so-distant past can offer guidance. During the Cold War, the United
States chose to contain the Soviet Union, successfully deterring its
military aggression and limiting its political influence for decades.
[The United States should apply containment once again, now to Russia,
China, and Iran]{.underline}. The contemporary world is similar enough
to its mid-twentieth-century predecessor to make that old strategy
relevant but different enough that it needs to be modified and updated.
While success is not guaranteed, a new containment policy offers the
best chance to defend American interests in the twenty-first century.
Now as before, [the possibility of armed conflict exerts a major
influence on the foreign policies of the United States]{.underline} and
countries throughout Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. The Cold War
divided the world into rival camps, with regions and even countries
split in two. Today, similar [cleavages are developing, with each
**revisionist power seeking its own sphere of influence** separate from
the larger U.S.-backed global order.]{.underline} Now as before, [the
revisionist powers]{.underline} [are dictatorships that]{.underline}
challenge American values as well as American interests. They [seek to
overturn political, military, and economic arrangements the United
States helped establish long ago]{.underline} and has supported ever
since. [Should]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin's Russia succeed in
reasserting control over parts of the former Soviet Union]{.underline},
[Xi Jinping's China gain control over]{.underline} maritime commerce in
[the western Pacific]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} Ayatollah Ali
[Khamenei's Iran dominate]{.underline} the [oil reserves]{.underline} of
the Persian Gulf, [the United States]{.underline}, its allies, [and the
global order they uphold would suffer a major blow]{.underline}. The

POOL / REUTERS But today's circumstances differ from those of the past
in several important ways. During most of the Cold War, Washington
confronted a single powerful opponent, the Soviet Union---the leader of
the international communist movement. Now it must cope with three
separate adversaries, each largely independent of the other two. Russia
and China cooperate, but they also compete with each other. And while
both have good relations with Iran, both also have large and potentially
restive Muslim populations, giving them reason to worry about the growth
of Iranian power and influence. Cold War containment was a single global
undertaking, implemented regionally. Contemporary containment will
involve three separate regional initiatives, implemented in
coordination. The Soviet Union, moreover, presented a strong ideological
challenge, devoted as it was to advancing not just Moscow's geopolitical
interests but also its communist principles. Neither Russia nor China
has such a crusading ideology today. Russia has abandoned communism
completely, and China has done so partially, retaining the notion of
party supremacy but shedding most of the economics and the messianic
zeal. And although the Islamic Republic represents a cause and not just
a stretch of territory, the potential appeal of its ideology is largely
limited to the Muslim world and, primarily, its Shiite minority. None of
today's revisionist powers possesses the Soviet Union's fearsome
military capabilities. Russia is a shrunken version of its older self
militarily, and Iran lacks formidable modern military forces. China's
economic growth may ultimately allow it to match the United States in
all strategic dimensions and pose a true peer threat, but to date,
Beijing is concentrating on developing forces to exclude the United
States from the western Pacific, not to project power globally.
Moreover, the initiatives each has launched so far---Russia's seizure of
Crimea and Middle East meddling, China's island building, Iran's
regional subversion---have been limited probes rather than all-out
assaults on the existing order. The United States does not have to deal
with a single mortal threat from a country committed to remaking the
entire world in its own image. Lastly, the Soviet Union was largely
detached from the U.S.-centered global economy during the Cold War,
whereas today's revisionist powers are very much a part of it. Russia
and Iran have relatively small economies and export mostly energy, but
China has the world's second-largest economy, with deep, wide, and
growing connections to countries everywhere. Economic interdependence
will complicate containment. China, for example, may be a political and
military rival, but it is also a crucial economic partner. The United
States depends on China to finance its deficits. China depends on the
United States to buy its exports. Containment in Asia will thus require
other policies as well, because although a Chinese military collapse
would enhance Asian security, a Chinese economic collapse would bring
economic disaster. Together, these differences make today's containment
a less urgent challenge than its Cold War predecessor. The United States
does not have to deal with a single mortal threat from a country
committed to remaking the entire world in its own image. It must address
three serious but lesser challenges, mounted by countries seeking not
heaven on earth but greater regional power and autonomy. But if today's
challenges are less epic, they are far more complicated. The old
containment was simple, if not easy. The new containment will have to
blend a variety of policies, carefully coordinated with one another in
design and execution. This will tax the ingenuity and flexibility of the
United States and its allies. STRONGER TOGETHER As during the Cold War,
[containment today requires American military deployments
abroad]{.underline}. In Europe, [ground troops are needed to deter
Russian aggression]{.underline}. The Putin regime has already sent
forces into Georgia and Ukraine. [The United States is committed to
protecting its NATO allies]{.underline}. [These include the Baltic
states]{.underline}, tiny countries on Russia's border. By defending
them, the United States could encounter some of the same difficulties it
did defending West Berlin, including, in the worst case, having to
decide whether to bring nuclear weapons into play rather than accept
military defeat. [East Asia requires a robust U.S. naval presence to
fend off China]{.underline}'s campaign to dominate the western Pacific.
[The United States is committed to protecting allies such as Japan,
South Korea, and Taiwan and maintaining open sea-lanes]{.underline}, and
it conducts what it calls "freedom-of-navigation operations" in
international waters newly claimed by China to make clear that the rest
of the world does not accept Chinese claims and Chinese dominance there.
At the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, July 2018 At the NATO

Middle East, American naval and air forces are needed to safeguard
shipments]{.underline} [of]{.underline} Persian Gulf [oil to Europe and
Asia and to support a successful rollback of the Iranian nuclear
program]{.underline}, should that become necessary. American troops on
the ground are not required; it is local forces that must check Iranian
efforts at regional subversion (which are carried out by local
militias). [Diplomatically, Washington needs to maintain or assemble
broad coalitions of local powers to oppose each revisionist
challenge]{.underline}. In Europe, [NATO]{.underline} was created to
carry out this very mission and so [should be the pillar of the United
States' strategy there]{.underline}. [In Asia and the Middle East, the
"hub and spoke" pattern]{.underline} of American Cold War alliances
[still exists,]{.underline} even as regional powers have begun to
collaborate among themselves. Working with partners exploits
[Washington's]{.underline} greatest strength: its [ability to attract
allies and create powerful coalitions]{.underline} against isolated
opponents. Coordinating with other countries also [endows American
foreign policy with a legitimacy it would otherwise lack]{.underline},
[showing that the United States is]{.underline} not simply acting for
itself but [defending]{.underline} [broad principles of international
order]{.underline} that many others support.

**US hegemony is key to prevent a great power war - empirics**

**Spoehr 18** (Thomas Spoehr, expert on national defense policy and
strategy, and has testified before the U.S. Congress on defense
strategy, budgets and equipment modernization. 09-21-2018, \"America
Shouldn't Abandon Its Global Leadership Role,\" Heritage Foundation,
https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/america-shouldnt-abandon-its-global-leadership-role)

In raw dollar amounts, [the U.S. spends a great deal on
defense]{.underline}. But as the ranking committee member must know,
today's defense budget is actually quite low when measured by historic
standards. As a share of the U.S. economy, it is now 3.1 percent of the
country's GDP --- only slightly higher than the historic low of 2.7
percent, recorded in 1999. Meanwhile, as a percentage of federal
spending, defense stands at a historic low: 14.8 percent --- the least
since the Pentagon started keeping statistics in 1940. As for the
[nuclear
stockpile](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/aged-us-nuclear-stockpile-and-infrastructure-must-evolve-address-21st-century),
the ultimate guarantor of our safety, it is now the smallest, least
diverse, and oldest it has been since its inception. The same day that
Smith made these remarks, committee chairman Mac Thornberry (R., Texas)
was speaking across town at an event where he
[received](https://www.csis.org/events/chairman-mac-thornberry-national-security-and-politics-turbulent-times)
the 2018 Sam Nunn Prize from the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. In his acceptance remarks, Thornberry presented a view
diametrically opposed to that of Smith. The chairman's preferred path is
to preserve and strengthen the liberal international order and the
military power that underpins it. Thornberry
[quoted](https://warontherocks.com/2018/06/why-visit-normandy-reflections-on-a-birthplace-of-the-liberal-international-order/)
Georgetown professor Paul Miller on the peace--power connection: "[The
liberal international order does not exist because it is a better idea.
It exists because the democratic powers built bigger and better guns."
For over 70 years, those democratic powers have been led by the United
States. And they continue to look to the U.S. for leadership --- a
leadership that is supported by American military power and the U.S.
defense budget.]{.underline} Thornberry emphasized the connection
between global stability and U.S. military might, saying, "to me [it is
not a coincidence that as our defense budget was being cut by more than
20 percent from 2010 to 2017, the world grew more
dangerous."]{.underline} A quick stroll around the globe offers evidence
supporting Thornberry's claim. [Russia aggression, Chinese expansion,
robust Iranian support of terrorism, and North Korean nukes --- all have
advanced over the last decade, to the point where today
they]{.underline} seriously [threaten U.S. interests.]{.underline} How
well can today's military protect those interests? The Heritage
Foundation's [Index of U.S. Military
Strength](https://www.heritage.org/military-strength) reports that by at
least 2011 (and quite possibly earlier), U.S. military readiness was in
serious decline --- the result of a decade of high operational pace and
insufficient investment due to the defense-spending cuts imposed by the
Budget Control Act. Appearing before the House Armed Services Committee
in 2017, the newly minted secretary of defense, Jim Mattis,
[testified](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/defense-secretary-jim-mattis-shocked-by-poor-state-of-us-combat-readiness/)
that he was "shocked" by the military's poor state of readiness for
combat. Chairman Thornberry went on to say, "Although we've begun to
turn the budget around, we still have a lot more work to do to make sure
we have a military that is ready for the challenges ahead." This is why
[it is important to have the 2019 defense-appropriations bill [passed on
time](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/continuing-resolutions-invariably-harm-national-defense).
It is also why it is important to continue investing in [rebuilding our
military](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/the-military-rebuild-needs-start-2018).]{.underline}
Representatives Smith and Thornberry have articulated two starkly
different views of America's proper role on the world stage and its
national spending priorities. In the coming months and years, the
American people and our political leadership will have to decide which
path to take. [Britain faced a similar choice a century ago. It emerged
from World War I as one of the few countries able to preserve peace in
Europe. Yet it chose to focus internally, allowing German military power
to grow unchecked. Ultimately, it --- and the rest of Europe --- wound
up with the catastrophe of World War II. To remain the world's leading
power, maintaining the liberal international order and preserving the
values that built it, will require commitment. National defense will
have to be treated as the priority it deserves to be]{.underline} ---
and that will require adequate, sustained funding. It is worth it? As
George Washington said, "to be prepared for war is one of the most
effectual means of preserving peace."Bottom of Form

#### US hegemony ensures security networks which are key to challenge rising powers

[Raison de l'Hégémonie can apply to leading states in different systemic
settings, with the lattertwentieth-century United States representing an
especially strong case. The result is a hegemonic order that can feed
back and sustain the core capabilities of the leading state. The
development of social networks that may enhance complementarity between
protection and production reinforces]{.underline} 33 Brooks, Producing

logic. 36 [Hegemonic capability is necessary]{.underline} (but not
sufficient[) to achieve centrality within a security network. Power
projection is required for sustaining far-flung alliance networks in
different regions. Location is also key. The combination of power
projection, especially naval capability, and location helped win the
British Empire and the United States central positions in their
respective orders.]{.underline} Figures 1--3 compare the US security
network with those of its past and current challengers. They are
textbook applications of network analysis, showing that [superior
military capability facilitates network centrality and that centrality
promotes security ties between similar nodes ("homophily") that may
evolve into homogenous subgroups, as is particularly true in the US
case]{.underline}.37 However, while geopolitical factors are necessary
for centrality, they are insufficient for predicting what relationships
will form, as shown by the US-USSR-China comparison. Despite the sharp
growth in China's military capabilities, North Korea remains Beijing's
only security ally. **[The United States' vast preexisting security
network has drastically reduced the probability of ties between other
countries and rival great powers]{.underline}**. Once formed these
relationships become sticky and path dependent. They are rarely severed
(though examples of 36 Unlike recent studies of hierarchy, however, we
consider these relationships in network rather than dyadic terms; cf.

sides; for example, see those between the United States and New Zealand
in 1986 and between the Soviet Union and China in 1980). 38 [Studying
patterns in the security network shows the ramifications of unequal
interstate connections, both in terms of their magnitude and
arrangement. Of particular relevance are networks with "structural
holes"---defined as the absence of connections between two states both
connected to a third state]{.underline}.40 Structural holes provide
third-party benefits, tertius gaudens, from brokering connections
between unconnected parties.41 [When there are no structural holes in a
state's connections but other states have them, the fully connected
state also benefits from structural autonomy, which refers to the extra
flexibility in managing its own connections.]{.underline} As Figure 1
shows, [the United States is connected to sixty-four states grouped into
two alliances, NATO and the OAS]{.underline}. As Michael Mastanduno
stresses in his contribution to this issue, 42 [not all alliances are
equal, nor are all alliance members equal in terms of their underlying
capability or their relationship to the United States]{.underline}.
Network analysis provides a way for us to think about how the United
States can use these asymmetries to its advantage. Within each alliance,
states are also connected to each other. **[Outside the two main
security alliances, NATO and the OAS, the United States is connected to
five additional security partners.]{.underline}** All of them have
structural holes because they do not have formal security connections to
members within the two alliances and Canada. Structural holes also exist
between the two alliances, which are formally unconnected[. The **US
security** network **is unmatched** **because of** four characteristics:
the scale of the US network; disproportionate US capability within the
network; US centrality within the network (as measured by the number of
US ties to other countries); and **the structure of the network** (as
measured by other countries ties to the US and each other). These
properties offer the United States extraordinary leverage and
flexibility]{.underline}

### Impact -- Human Trafficking

#### American leadership solves human trafficking -- empirics

**[American leadership is critical to combatting human
trafficking]{.underline}**, a global crisis that knows no borders and
devastates individuals and families. Trafficking also undermines the
global economy and threatens our national security. In 2016, the
International Labor Organization estimated that 40.3 million people live
in modern slavery, controlled and forced to work by others and sold as
commodities (24.9 million in forced labor and sex trafficking, and 15.4
million in forced marriage). **[Trafficking is estimated to have grown

of debt bondage. The United States has a strong track record of results
in fighting traffickers and strengthening the rule of law, supporting
survivors, and raising awareness that advances our interests abroad and
at home. As Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has observed, "human
trafficking is a global problem, but it's a local one too." This is a
crisis that affects nearly every country including the United States,
and many of America's state leaders across the country -- in cities like
Houston and Phoenix, and states including Alabama and Missouri -- have
established human trafficking task forces to combat the problem at a
local level.

Prosecution: Fighting Traffickers and Strengthening the Rule of Law

**[Thanks to]{.underline}** support from **[the State Department's
Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons]{.underline}**
(TIP), **[there were 11,096 prosecutions of traffickers around the world
in 2018]{.underline}** -- **[a significant increase from 7,909
prosecutions]{.underline}** in 2011. TIP helped to train 4,530 criminal
justice practitioners in FY17 -- ranging from prosecutors to judges to
law enforcement officials -- subsequently strengthening both
investigations and prosecutions in 20 countries.

Protection: Supporting Survivors

**[Trafficking disproportionately impacts women and
children]{.underline}**. Women and girls account for **[99% of all
victims of sex trafficking]{.underline}**, and **[58% of all other forms
of trafficking]{.underline}**. Children account for 26% of all victims
of forced labor. In 2017 alone, USAID programs reached more than 15,000
survivors of trafficking, providing services such as legal support,
medical care, skills training, and job placement. **[TIP has launched
several Child Protection Compact Partnerships]{.underline}**, which
require foreign governments to invest in anti-trafficking programs and
bolster their own civil society efforts to protect children at risk. In
**[Ghana]{.underline}**, this **[partnership has provided
anti-trafficking training to 500 police officers]{.underline}**,
renovated a shelter for children survivors, and provided community
engagement to over 11,000 people.

Prevention: Raising Awareness

**[With State Department]{.underline}** support, **[85,613 cases of
trafficking were identified around the world in 2018]{.underline}** --
**[more than double the 42,291 cases identified in 2011]{.underline}**.
**[USAID's implementing partners have reached out to promote public
awareness]{.underline}** of the risks of trafficking to more than 1.76
million individuals in countries such as Bangladesh, Tajikistan, and
Afghanistan. **[The State Department]{.underline}**, in partnership with
the online education provider Coursera, **[provided more than 6,000
refugees with vital information]{.underline}** that helps reduce their
vulnerability to trafficking.

Over the past two decades, **[bipartisan support in Congress has been a
driving force in strengthening U.S. leadership]{.underline}** in the
global fight against human trafficking.

**[The Trafficking Victims Protection Act]{.underline}**
(**[TVPA]{.underline}**) **[was signed into law in 2000
and]{.underline}** has been **[reauthorized five times]{.underline}**,
most recently in 2018. **[TVPA created an Interagency Task Force on
trafficking and]{.underline}** calls for an annual **[Trafficking in
Persons]{.underline}** (**[TIP]{.underline}**) **[Report]{.underline}**
-- which includes information on progress in fighting trafficking around
the world and helps the U.S. government craft country-specific
strategies. The Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report ranks the efforts of
country governments to combat human trafficking each year. Countries
with the worst records are ranked Tier 3, and, following TVPA
legislation, may face cuts to non-humanitarian and non-trade-related
U.S. assistance as a consequence. The President can waive these
recommendations if the assistance is in the U.S. national interest or if
restrictions would negatively impact vulnerable populations in the
country. Recently, Members of Congress have expressed concerns that
restrictions are being used in ways not intended by the legislation --
and that cutting assistance based on the TIP Report could harm U.S.
efforts to respond to crises in these countries where we face other
threats such as outbreaks of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC). The DRC is one of 21 countries on Tier 3 of the 2019 TIP Report.
**[Through the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of
2015]{.underline}**, **[Congress established the U.S. Advisory Council
on Human Trafficking]{.underline}**, **[which consists of trafficking
survivors who advise]{.underline}** the **[State Department
on]{.underline}** best practices in **[combatting human
trafficking]{.underline}**. The **[End Modern Slavery Initiative was
passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of
2017]{.underline}** through which **[the U.S. has contributed nearly
\$50 million to the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery]{.underline}**
(**[GFEMS]{.underline}**), which works in critical countries to improve
the rule of law, develop economic opportunities to prevent trafficking,
and reintegrate and aid survivors. GFEMS ultimately hopes to catalyze
\$1.5 billion in both public and private investment to effectively
tackle this crisis.

### Impact -- Middle East

#### Absent American primacy in the Middle East, conflict is inevitable -- retrenchment risks oil instability, a power vacuum, humanitarian crises, and the reemergence of ISIS

These are all serious arguments and some of them have a very seductive
quality. After all, who wants to argue that the U.S. should persist in
unceasing conflict with no prospect of victory? Unfortunately, however,
[the argument for retrenchment]{.underline}, [while superficially
attractive,]{.underline} [neglects]{.underline} some [basic regional and
geopolitical realities.]{.underline} The first, and perhaps, most
important reality is that [the Middle East]{.underline} as a subordinate
element of the international system [is inextricably tied up with
security in both Europe and East Asia]{.underline}. As L. Carl Brown
noted more than 30 years ago, "for roughly the last two centuries the
Middle East has been consistently and more thoroughly ensnarled in great
power politics than any other part of the non-Western world." [That
remains the case today]{.underline} ([as Russian and Chinese attention
to the region attests]{.underline}) and is unlikely to change anytime
soon. Since Napoleon marched into Egypt in 1798, the region has been
unable to reach a stable equilibrium among the national forces unleashed
by the decline and ultimate collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Outside
powers have struggled for influence over and mastery of the region with
a shifting constellation of alliances and alignments. As the post-World
War II global order came into being, American policymakers viewed the
Middle East's energy resources as a vital interest, above all, for our
allies in Europe and Asia. At the outset, the responsibility, from
Washington's point of view, for maintaining regional order largely
rested with Britain. This view began to change in the 1950s and shifted
decisively after the UK gave up its defense responsibilities East of
Suez in 1967. Ultimately, the importance of preventing an outside
hostile power from dominating the region was recognized formally by
President Jimmy Carter in his State of the Union address in 1980. As a
practical matter his successors have tried to preserve access to the
Gulf and prevent not just an outside power but any regional power from
achieving hegemony in the region as well. After 9/11 the eradication of
jihadist terrorist groups became an additional strategic objective.
[What would be the consequences of]{.underline} upending this
traditional policy and [ending the role of the US as the balancer of
choice and organizer of security frameworks in the region?]{.underline}
Does it matter in an era of US energy self-sufficiency? [What reasons
might exist for a continued U.S. role? First, despite rising U.S. energy
production]{.underline} and prospective self-sufficiency, [oil remains a
globally traded commodity]{.underline}, [and hence]{.underline} real or
even potential **[disruptions to the flow of oil anywhere would have
serious negative effects on]{.underline}** price levels and the growth
of [**the U.S. economy**. **The Middle East still contains half of
global proven oil reserves**]{.underline}, accounts for one-third of oil
production and exports, and is home to three of the world's four biggest
oil transit chokepoints. [Moreover, our allies in both Europe and East
Asia remain vulnerable to disruptions in the flow of oil. **Second, the
withdrawal of American power will create a vacuum that**]{.underline},
as recent events in the Levant have demonstrated, **[will be filled by
malign forces]{.underline}**. [Russia's armed intervention]{.underline}
has established it as the arbiter of the region's political future. It
[has no intention of yielding up this hard-won geopolitical
achievement]{.underline}. **[Both Russia and Iran]{.underline}** [want
to roll back U.S. influence even further in the region]{.underline}, and
each depends on the other to help it do so---primarily in Syria, but
also [through deepening Russian diplomatic, economic and technical
assistance for **Iran's nuclear**]{.underline} and conventional
[**weapons programs**.]{.underline} Benefitting as much as it does,
Russia is unlikely to reduce its ties with Iran at anything approaching
an acceptable cost to the United States. Nor is Moscow's approach to
counterterrorism at all complementary to our own. On the contrary,
Russia's indiscriminate bludgeoning of Syrian cities from the air
destroyed the moderate opposition and gave further fuel to Sunni
grievances. Continued Russian and Iranian presence in Syria and beyond
may be able to maintain Assad in power but it will not be able ensure
stability in the region. On the contrary, it is likely **[that the
Russo-Iranian presence will intensify security competitions that
destabilize the region and create an ongoing threat]{.underline}** to
Israel's security. [Third]{.underline}, as Kenneth Pollack has recently
noted [Arab military effectiveness remains]{.underline} (with some
notable exceptions like the UAE and Jordanian special forces who have
acquitted themselves well in Afghanistan) [quite limited]{.underline}.
The [results of this]{.underline} limited effectiveness [are on
display]{.underline} in the ongoing war [in Yemen which has yielded
little]{.underline} in the way of a positive [geopolitical result but
has created a deepening humanitarian crisis]{.underline}. The
Saudi-Emirati intervention in **[the ongoing Yemeni civil
war]{.underline}** in 2015 **[was the fruit of the Obama
Administration's efforts to diminish U.S. involvement]{.underline}** in
the region and its studied inaction in Syria. The **[ongoing disasters
in Syria and Yemen are an indication of what one can expect if the U.S.
no longer provides a framework for security in the
region]{.underline}**. [Fourth]{.underline}, as several commentators
have noted **[what happens in the region will not necessarily stay in
the region]{.underline}**. As a result of globalization and the region's
critical location, [instability]{.underline} there still [reverberates
outward through Europe, Africa, East Asia, and even]{.underline} the
[America]{.underline}n homeland. Radical Islamists have made clear their
grievances run much deeper than our footprint in the region. Indeed,
**[ISIS only grew into a regional, then global, threat largely because
of our diminishing presence and the security vacuum it created in
Iraq]{.underline}**. At the same time, the Russian-Iranian sponsored
indiscriminate offensives conducted by the Assad regime against its own
people have triggered [massive refugee outflows]{.underline} that [are
exacerbating Europe's already strained economic and social
fabric]{.underline} and threatening to overwhelm the security
institutions of some our closest allies. A precipitate [**U.S.
withdrawal could lead to a collapse of the anti-ISIS coalition and a
re-emergence of the organization as a threat to U.S. allies and
ultimately the homeland.** Finally]{.underline}, America still faces the
problem that, in a globalized world, security commitments are, to some
degree, indivisible. If, in fact, our major security challenges are in
Europe and East Asia, [the perception that the U.S. is reneging
on]{.underline} its [long-standing security commitments in the region
will create doubts]{.underline} -- in the eyes of both friends and foes
-- [about our willingness to maintain our commitments
elsewhere]{.underline} in the world [like the Baltics, the Korean
Peninsula, or the South China Sea]{.underline} These are powerful
arguments in favor of the U.S. retaining a strategy of engagement and
forward presence in the Middle East. Regardless, [the]{.underline}
[skeptics' argument that such a policy lacks public support
remains]{.underline} a [powerful]{.underline} criticism. There is,
[**however**,]{.underline} an answer to that reproach. [It is not the
case that there is no choice between a total withdrawal of U.S. power
from the region and a large-scale, costly presence]{.underline} on the
order of what was involved in Operation Iraq Freedom and Operation
Enduring Freedom. [The U.S. does indeed have other options]{.underline},
and what has been undertaken since 2014 by both the Obama and Trump
Administrations points the way. That effort relied largely on small
numbers of U.S. special forces as advisers and trainers, along with
coalition airpower to eliminate the ISIS caliphate and maintain a
limited force in Syria and Iraq that could obstruct Russian and Iran
from exercising uncontested influence in both places. The presence in
Syria, for example, was an enormously successful undertaking that
liberated Raqqa from ISIS and is now on the cusp of eliminating the last
vestiges of the Islamic State's physical caliphate. It also provided an
obstacle to Iran developing a land bridge that would stretch all the way
to the border with Israel. The number of U.S. forces was small, the
costs were limited and the casualties were quite light. There was no
groundswell of public opinion calling for the U.S. to withdraw, before
the President made his snap decision on the basis of a phone call with
Turkey's President Recep Tayipp Erdogan. [A strategy that relies on a
limited U.S. presence while working with and through allies and partners
continues to be a viable option]{.underline}, indeed perhaps the only
option, for maintaining U.S. presence and influence in a vital region
and limiting the influence of our Russian and Iranian competitors.
**[Without a continued U.S. presence there is a chance]{.underline}** --
and not an inconsequential one - **[that the jihadists,]{.underline}**
whose residual cadre of some fifteen to thirty thousand fighters remains
a major security challenge, **[may be able to reconstitute
themselves]{.underline}** and present a renewed threat to the safety and
security of our European allies and the U.S. homeland. [It is also
likely that any effort to contain or roll back Iran's growing malign
influence]{.underline} and activity in the region [will be less
successful without a continued U.S. role in providing the security
framework]{.underline}. We already see signs that both local and NATO
allies do not want to participate in any "stability" force in
northeastern Syria absent a U.S. role.

### Impact -- Russia

#### Longstanding historical tensions are reverting the frayed liberal order into a collection of nationalist states. Continued decline would embolden Russian expansionism triggering nuclear exchanges. US hegemony needs to be restored to prevent global war.

THE RETURN OF HISTORY **[There are signs all around us today that the
jungle is growing back. History is returning. Nations are reverting to
old habits and traditions.]{.underline}** This should not be a surprise.
Those habits and traditions are shaped by powerful forces: [an
unchanging geography, shared history and experiences, and often by
spiritual and ideological beliefs that defy modern reason.]{.underline}
Peoples and nations tend to revert to type. The Russia of today is
different from the Russia of 1958 or 1918 or 1818, but it is also
remarkable how much [Russians' geopolitical ambitions and
insecurities]{.underline}, their ambivalent attitudes toward Europe and
the West, and even their politics [have not changed]{.underline}. No one
doubts that [China's past]{.underline}, both its long regional hegemony
in past centuries and its "century of humiliation" beginning in the
early nineteenth century, [shapes present Chinese
attitudes]{.underline}, just as [Iranians' ambitions are shaped by their
Islamic and their Persian roots]{.underline}. We are always looking for
and anticipating radical shifts in the trajectories of nations, but
those shifts rarely prove as dramatic as we expect. Not so long ago
people were talking about the remarkable rise of the BRICS, which, in
addition to India and China, included the growing economic and political
clout of Brazil and the economic success of Turkey, South Africa, and
Russia. But today, aside from China and India, that phenomenon is
already a thing of the past. [Brazil has become Brazil again; South
Africa has been mired in corruption and political turmoil; Russia has
returned to being Russia. China has an emperor again. **They have sunk
back into old political, social, and economic habits.**]{.underline}
This is true even in the heart of the West. [In]{.underline}
"post-historical" [Europe, the past is not forgotten but lurks always
just beneath the surface]{.underline}. [It doesn't take much for
Italians or Greeks to start calling Germans Nazis, for the French to
joke about Germans marching down the Champs-Élysées, for Poles to feel
nervously squeezed between their two historical conquerors.]{.underline}
Many were surprised at the [British vote to leave the European
Union]{.underline}, but from a historical perspective there [was nothing
unusual about the English seeking distance from the
continent]{.underline}. And the same holds for Americans. Their
attitudes toward themselves and toward the world are still heavily
shaped by the two vast oceans that stand between them and the world's
other great powers. The fact that planes and ships and missiles, as well
as digital signals, cross those oceans in a way they did not in previous
centuries does not seem to have disturbed Americans' comforting belief
that the world's problems need not affect them and that they have a
choice whether or not to have a foreign policy. Hence [Americans have
also returned to old habits]{.underline}. [History does not repeat
itself, but nations travel along deep and broad ruts in which they have
been traveling for hundreds of years]{.underline}, and though they may
be knocked or pulled out of those ruts by powerful forces and events,
there will always be a tendency to slip back into them. Eadem, sed
aliter was Schopenhauer's phrase, "[the same, but
different."]{.underline} We can't see the world "as it is" by looking at
the world of the past thirty years, therefore. That world was shaped by
[American power and by the liberal world order to which other nations
have been forced to adjust their behavior]{.underline}. [Russia's
behavior has been shaped by what Russian leaders believed the United
States would or had to tolerate as well as by their sense of the liberal
order's strength and cohesion]{.underline}. [The same has been true of
China's behavior, and Iran's, **and that of every other nation or
nonstate actor that might seek to disrupt or topple the existing order.
All would behave differently if America behaved
differently,**]{.underline} and so would America's allies and the rest
of the world. To see the world "as it is" requires imagining what the
world would look like had history not been redirected by the United
States, a world in which great powers returned to the paths they had
been on before the United States stepped into its role. This requires no
great feat of prognostication. It mostly requires remembering how
nations have historically behaved when given the chance. [Russia's
behavior has certainly conformed in recent years to the long sweep of
Russian history.]{.underline} For a brief moment, Russians toyed with
breaking from their past, pulling out of the deep ruts, and redefining
their interests, as Germany and Japan had been forced to do after World
War II and as France and Britain did somewhat more voluntarily. [The
Russians seemed prepared to embrace]{.underline} integration in the
American-led world order in order to reform, ["modernize," and achieve
prosperity---and also security]{.underline}---even if it meant
abandoning centuries-old geopolitical ambitions, letting go of
centuries-old insecurities, and giving up their historical sphere of
interest. [That Russians ultimately rejected that course has been
unfortunate but not entirely surprising]{.underline}. Nor was Russia's
behavior primarily a response to actions by the West, such as the
enlargement of NATO. **[Long-standing Russian ambitions and
insecurities, together with a tradition of autocrats benefiting from
popular fears of foreign threats, have made it difficult for Russia to
steer out of old ruts.]{.underline}** For the better part of three
centuries, the Russian empire had included everything from the
territories of the Baltics to the Black Sea, as well as parts of Poland.
For decades the Soviet Union was regarded by the world as a superpower,
the equal of the United States, the co-manager of a "bipolar world." The
Cold War may have been a low point for the living standards and
individual freedoms of many Russians, but it was a high point in
Russia's long history as a great power and empire, equaling the triumph
of 1814 when Russian forces drove across Europe and occupied Paris.
[During the Cold War, pride in this superpower role even offered some
compensation for the privations and abuses Russians suffered at home. If
Russians had changed their historical trajectory]{.underline} after the
end of the Cold War, if like Germany and Japan they had chosen economic
over geopolitical competition, [focused on improving their standard of
living and integrating themselves fully into the liberal world economy,
they might have lived better lives]{.underline} but at the price of
Russia's historical greatness on the world stage. We would like to
believe that ordinary Russian people would gladly have traded superpower
status for a freer, safer, and more prosperous existence. That is part
of our modern, liberal faith. [But the Russian people's desire to
restore their country to greatness on the world stage proved to be a
significant factor in Russian politics after the Cold War]{.underline}.
Ultranationalists like Vladimir Zhirinovsky consistently received a
quarter of the votes in elections, and Zhirinovsky's platform had less
to do with national security, strictly speaking, than with national
honor, national greatness, and the survival of Russian culture. "Unless
we get back the historical borders of Russia," he argued, the Russian
people were "slowly going to degrade and die out." The U.S. bombing of
Serbia in March 1999 outraged Russians, not only because they
sympathized with their fellow Slavs but because Russia's inability to do
anything about it was a reminder of Russia's diminished stature on the
world stage. Even the billions of dollars in financial aid provided by
the West was humiliating. In the 1930s Stalin had promised, "We shall
catch up to America and overtake it." Now America was giving Russia
handouts.139 It did not help that the political and economic reforms
instituted first by Mikhail Gorbachev and then by Boris Yeltsin neither
improved Russians' economic situation nor, it seemed, produced true
democracy. Instead, a few got rich and powerful while the rest suffered.
The United States and the West ended up providing Russia billions of
dollars, but there were critical moments, including at the very
beginning, when the Bush administration had been parsimonious. [There
was no Marshall Plan for Russia as there had been for Western
Europe]{.underline}. It's not clear that it would have made a
difference. The Russians had their own Dolchstosslegende, a Russian
version of post--World War I Germany's stab-in-the-back story, featuring
Gorbachev and Yeltsin as the villains who caved in to the West, gave up
Russia's position in Eastern and Central Europe, and allowed the Soviet
Union itself to break up---the greatest "geopolitical catastrophe" of
the twentieth century, as Putin put it. It was in this context that [the
United States and the West came to be viewed as a threat: not to
Russia's security but to Russian ambition and Russian
pride.]{.underline} Many Russians, led by Putin, have pointed to NATO
enlargement as proof of the West's hostile intent---and many American
critics of the decision have agreed. But as Russian generals and
strategic thinkers admitted in candid moments, [NATO's expansion did not
increase the alliance's overall military capabilities or the threat to
Russian security.]{.underline} The two decades after the Cold War saw
steady decreases in the numbers of U.S. troops in Europe and, even by
Russian estimates, an overall reduction of the "joint military potential
of its members."140 Putin certainly had much less reason to worry about
the U.S. or NATO threat when Barack Obama was in the White House than
Gorbachev did in the era of the Reagan defense buildup. More than
Russia's security, NATO's enlargement threatened Russia's ability to
reassert its regional sphere of interest, to reclaim its position as a
dominant power in Eastern and Central Europe and its standing on the
world stage as an equal of the United States. **[This may not have been
strictly rational, but feelings of pride and honor are often more potent
than rational calculations of interest]{.underline}**. They shaped the
policies of Germany and Japan, the self-described "have-not" nations of
the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and the result was to
create self-fulfilling prophecies. Germany's arms buildup accompanied by
a bullying diplomacy produced the very predicament German leaders
claimed to fear: the encirclement by hostile neighbors. Russia's actions
have had the same effect. By the end of the Obama administration,
Putin's attempts to restore Russian influence and military involvement
from Northern Europe to the Middle East sufficiently unnerved its
neighbors that the United States felt compelled to increase its military
role in a region from which it had been steadily pulling away. Last year
American forces in Eastern Europe increased for the first time in three
decades. [Many in the West have seen this as a "security dilemma"
and]{.underline} sought ways to solve what they regard as an unfortunate
misunderstanding. Such was the theory behind the Obama administration
effort to "reset" relations with Russia back in 2009. That effort
failed, however, and in large part because it misdiagnosed Russians'
feelings and motives. In the classic security dilemma as imagined by
international relations theorists, insecurity rises on both sides
despite the fact that both sides are trying to reduce their insecurity.
Tensions rise even as both sides seek to reduce tensions. Yet reducing
tensions has never been Putin's objective. He has wanted to increase
tensions, and insecurity, on both sides. And he has had sound reasons
for wanting to do so. The problem Russia has faced since the end of the
Cold War is that the greatness Putin and many Russians seek cannot be
achieved in a world that is secure and stable, in which [the liberal
order remains coherent and cohesive]{.underline}, especially in Europe,
and [in which the United States remains willing and able to continue
providing the basic guarantees that make the liberal order possible.
Russia's economy today is the size of Spain's. Its
military]{.underline}, except for its nuclear force, [is no longer that
of a superpower. Its demographic trends suggest a nation in
decline.]{.underline} The present world order affords Russia the chance
to be more secure than at any time in its history. But in this world
order Russia cannot be a superpower. To achieve greatness on the world
stage, Russia must bring the world back to a past when neither Russians
nor anyone else enjoyed security. To return Russia to its historical
influence on the world stage, the liberal order must be weakened and
toppled, and international strategic competition must be returned to its
normal historical state. Such a world not only offers the best chance of
restoring Russian greatness. It also serves Putin's personal ambitions.
It justifies and even requires a strong leader. Like the tsars of the
past, Putin tells the Russian people that to defend a "vast territory"
and to occupy "a major place in world affairs" require "enormous
sacrifices and privations on the part of our people."141 Stalin said
much the same, and indeed Putin's repeated comparisons of the United
States with Nazi Germany and his claim that opponents in Ukraine and
elsewhere are Nazis, evokes not only the Great Patriotic War and past
Russian glory but also the need for a strong leader like Stalin.
[Putin's hostility to the liberal world is also personal.]{.underline}
Ever since he consolidated power, he has worried that the external
forces of liberalism would work to undermine his authoritarian rule at
home. [Behind every democratic revolution on former Soviet territory, in
Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, he saw the hand of the West, and
particularly the United States]{.underline}, even though the role of
outsiders was not the decisive factor in the toppling of the
authoritarian regimes in those countries. His objection to the expansion
of NATO has less to do with the eastward advance of the alliance's
military power than the presence of democracies closer to Russia's
borders. Putin is at least as worried about the eastward advance of the
European Union as he is about NATO. It was after Ukraine negotiated a
trade agreement with the EU that he invaded and seized Crimea. It is
hard to see what concessions the United States and the West could offer
to address the complex mix of feelings and motives whose sources are
more internal than external, more psychological than strategic. Obama's
"reset," his decision to trim back missile defenses in Poland in
response to Russian objections, his tepid response to the attack on
Ukraine, and his acceptance of a Russian military role in Syria and the
broader Middle East did nothing to cure Russians' sense of grievance or
tame Putin's ambitions. They only emboldened Putin to press for more.
The election of Trump, who throughout his campaign expressed a desire
for improved relations with Moscow, did not affect Putin's approach to
the world. Those who suggest we should recognize a Russian sphere of
interest in its region should recall that Russia's historical sphere of
interest does not end in Ukraine; it begins in Ukraine. It includes the
Baltic states, and it includes Poland. That is a dangerous path to head
down, as history has shown. Even if we sacrificed Ukrainian independence
or Georgian independence or Baltic independence in the hope of calming
Russian anxieties and sating Russians' ambitions, such concessions would
not solve the problem, any more than feeding Manchuria to Japan and
Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany solved those problems. The peace
established after World War II and which endures almost seventy-five
years later was not based on accommodating Japanese and German
anxieties, even though those nations suffered infinitely greater horrors
at the hands of the Allies than anything Russians suffered at the end of
the Cold War. Among the liberal order's greatest contributions to
international peace has been the discrediting and denial of great-power
spheres of interest. To begin acknowledging and accepting such spheres
again would be a big step back to old patterns of history and to the
conflicts and instability that characterize the international system "as
it is." [Unfortunately, the liberal order has become sufficiently
frayed, and the American role in the world sufficiently
uncertain]{.underline}, that Putin is bound to continue probing for
weaknesses. Until now [Putin has sought to disrupt, divide, and degrade
the liberal world order through murky actions in the gray area between
war and]{.underline} [peace]{.underline}---through half invasions,
frozen conflicts, "little green men," and the manipulation of the
Internet and social media, including interference in elections on both
sides of the Atlantic. Whether he turns to more open forms of aggression
in the future, against Ukraine again or even against a NATO ally like
Estonia, will depend on his reading of the United States and the state
of the liberal world order. If the order is strong and confident and
backed by reliable American power, he will be cautious. A losing
confrontation with the West could be embarrassing and loosen Putin's
grip on power at home.142 [If the order appears weak and divided,
however, and the United States appears uncertain or uninterested, he
will be tempted to take the next bolder step.]{.underline} Nothing would
more surely destroy the liberal order and put Russia back in the big
game than proof that the United States was not prepared to come to the
defense of a treaty ally in Europe. An American president will face a
frightening choice if Putin decides to test the system. [Economic
sanctions alone will be no answer to an attack on a treaty ally, even a
murky attack in the gray]{.underline} area, but to do more, [to employ
NATO conventional forces, will quickly bring Russia and the United
States, two nuclear powers, to **the ultimate confrontation**. Putin is
already using nuclear threats to try to intimidate the United States and
Europe]{.underline}. If the United States is prepared to go
eyeball-to-eyeball again, as Kennedy did with Khrushchev in 1962, Putin
will likely back down. But would an American president have the courage
and the understanding to make him back down? President Obama said he
didn't want to risk a nuclear war over Ukraine, but one is tempted to
ask: Over which foreign country would he have been willing to risk
nuclear war? If the United States has to back down every time an act of
aggression is committed by a nuclear-armed power, it will be backing
down more and more in the years to come. [These are the kinds of
questions we may have to get used to facing if the liberal world order
continues to break down.]{.underline} For the past thirty years,
would-be disrupters of the order have been deterred even from bringing
things to such a point, but in a world where the United States appeared
no longer determined to uphold the order, they may choose a different
and more dangerous course.

Space Policy Directive needs to be to the Secretary of Energy,"

For the first time in decades, the United States faces a serious
challenge. [A new space race is upon us to secure the benefits of a vast
and expanding space economy]{.underline}. Whether it was grain for
horses and soldiers; wind and waterwheels for factories; coal for
railroads; coal or oil for steamships; petroleum for cars, tanks, and
airplanes; or atomic energy for cities and submarines, [energy has been
central to both commerce and military power]{.underline}. To secure
America's continuing advantage in the space domain, [the President
must]{.underline} tap the Secretary of Energy to [develop an immediate
and sustained response to secure space energy dominance.]{.underline} At
the center of [China]{.underline}'s [plans to surpass the United States
as the leading spacepower]{.underline} by 2045 are vast ambitions for
space energy dominance. China's military has already begun a peacetime
strategic offensive to secure a position of energy dominance. Within
this grand plan are four separate initiatives that demand a response:
Energy maneuverability dominance using space sourced propellant Global
energy dominance with space solar power and space power beaming Deep
space maneuver advantage with nuclear propulsion Fusion energy advantage
with helium-3 While there is significant capability within both NASA and
the DoD, the majority of our nation's expertise that can be brought to
bear to respond to the People's Republic of China's peacetime military
offensive lies within our Department of Energy. [To secure America's
continuing advantage in the space domain]{.underline}, [the President
must]{.underline} tap the Secretary of Energy to develop (in concert
with NASA and the US Space Force) an immediate and sustained response to
[secure space energy dominance]{.underline}. To ensure continued focus,
the DoE must reorganize internally and sit on the National Space
Council. Energy maneuverability dominance using space sourced propellant
US Air Force fighter pilot John Boyd was the first to introduce the
concept of Energy Maneuverability Theory as an explanation of maneuver
advantage. Reducing energy costs are key to reducing cost and time to
market for in-space transport of materials for in-space construction.
Energy maneuverability advantage is also key to both combat advantage
and military logistical advantage. There are certain positions within
the Earth-Moon system that provide significant maneuver advantage. The
ability to source rocket fuel from the Moon or asteroids is a
significant force multiplier. The lunar poles are equivalent to forward
coaling stations during our nation's naval expansion, and propellant
depots offer force extension analogous to aerial refueling. The PRC's
strategically wise push to secure access to the "great lakes"of frozen
water ice (600 million metric tons) must be met in kind with our own
national resolve to access lunar propellant to build on-orbit propellant
depots and refuelers. Th[e newly formed US Space Command is already
behind the PRC in lacking its own peacetime strategic military
offensive]{.underline}, and will be derelict in its duty if it does not
immediately specify the requirements to the Pentagon's Joint
Requirements Oversight Council and National Space Council for
space-sourced propellant, in-space refueling, and in-space transport to
meet the PRC challenge. As a remedy for this situation, the
Administration should task the Secretary of Energy to coordinate with
the NASA Administrator, Commandant of the US Space Force, and Secretary
of Commerce, to build a plan to retire all technical risk for a
cryogenic hydrogen/oxygen propellant depot with reversible fuel cells
for electrolysis, and a parallel plan for a Lunar Industrial Facility
(LIF) to produce and launch the required water-ice to replenish it. The
plan should establish goals and standards for refueling of reusable
lunar landers. Global energy dominance with space solar power and space
power beaming Central to the PRC's plans is to develop the technology to
build extremely large on-orbit power stations capable of capturing
gigawatts of power and beaming it to Earth and anywhere in the
Earth-Moon system. Even at the megawatt class planned for their 2030
prototype, this is a game-changing dual-use technology. The United
States at present has, at most, 100 kilowatts of power on the
International Space Station. The DOE program should seek, via
public-private partnerships, to retire the technical risk toward
commercially viable utility-scale space solar power. The tactical
threat, though, pales in significance to the strategic threat[. The
PRC's strategic plan to usurp US hegemonic power is to
create]{.underline}---through sustained national effort---[the
technology to build solar power satellites]{.underline}, [and then to
use the material from the Moon]{.underline} to build them cheaply [to
become the major supplier of Earth-based energy]{.underline}. Power that
is city-baseload appropriate, that can scale to the entirety of global
demand, that can be sent anywhere on Earth as needed, and that is 100
percent green and non-carbon producing will be attractive to most
nations. Today the Persian Gulf and the few chokepoints for oil are the
strategic center, with the key energy producers---the US, Russia,
OPEC---having substantial coercive power. [If the PRC succeeds in its
plans, it will be the major energy supplier to planet Earth, and with
that, enormous economic power to force others to submit to their
geopolitical designs]{.underline}. To meet this strategic challenge, the
administration should task the Secretary of Energy, at a minimum, to
maintain parity and seek strategic advantage with respect to commercial
space solar power and beamed energy production. This program should not
look like the DOE's fusion science program, which has no timeline or
goal for commercial energy production. Rather, the DOE program should
seek, via public-private partnerships, to retire the technical risk
toward commercially viable utility-scale space solar power. Central to
this goal should be a companion and parallel strategy to develop
multiple public-private partnerships at a Lunar Industrial Facility
(LIF) with the goal of mining, benefacting, and launching 90 percent of
the structural mass required to build a prototype megawatt-class solar
power satellite prototype in geostationary orbit ahead of the PRC plans
for 2035---the aim should be a 100-megawatt facility in GEO by 2034.
Deep space maneuver advantage with nuclear propulsion America has long
known that true spacefaring will require nuclear power propulsion. For a
decade it led the field with project NERVA, and again later with project
TIMBERWIND and Space Nuclear Test Program (SNTP). But a lack of
political nerve let this leadership languish. Now the PRC is open with
its design to have nuclear shuttles enabling it access for asteroid
mining, exploitation, and colonization by 2040. Nuclear thermal rockets
have more than twice the performance of traditional rockets, enabling
much larger payloads and much shorter travel times in the solar system.
It would be like asking a merchant fleet equipped with only sails to
keep up with a merchant fleet equipped with oil. Or, it would be like
asking an air force equipped with propellers to contend with an air
force with all jet fighters. To compete successfully as a space power,
the US must have a matching peacetime strategic offensive in space
nuclear power and propulsion. Therefore, the Administration should task
the Secretary of Energy to build a portfolio of public-private
partnerships to ensure sustained US advantage in advanced space
propulsion, including fission, fusion, antimatter and high-energy beamed
propulsion. At a minimum, it should ensure parity such that the US is
never behind on any significant test or deployment timeline for nuclear
propulsion. In every case, the DOE should have a transition strategy to
a private US commercial provider similar to the NASA commercial cargo
and crew programs. Fusion energy advantage with helium-3 The PRC's focus
to prospect for lunar helium-3 is evidence of the broader strategic
intent to lead in fusion power and fusion space propulsion. The reality
that today's technology cannot achieve sustained "over-unity" fusion is
immaterial---we know that physics makes this possible, and it is merely
a matter of sustained investment and ingenuity until this is achieved.
Already there are numerous companies in the US and other nations
developing fusion technologies using compact devices, and even
fusion-powered rockets. These are all starved for funding because of a
lack of national purpose and an unwillingness to face the reality of a
serious competitor for space hegemony. Helium-3 is prized because as a
fusion fuel, it produces virtually no neutron radiation, allowing for
sustained fusion that neither degrades the reactor structure nor
produces harmful radiation to humans. Importantly, there is not only
thousands of years of helium-3 on the lunar surface, but significant
concentrations of helium-3 in the outer solar system. Therefore, the
Administration should task the Secretary of Energy to develop a
long-term strategy to develop a portfolio of public-private partnerships
to lead commercial fusion development for space power and space
propulsion, with a parallel strategy to develop an ability to mine lunar
helium-3. The value of lunar industrialization and a lunar industrial
facility At the nexus of each of these strategic initiatives is the
Moon. This administration's focus on returning to the Moon quickly is
laudable. [It is likewise meaningful to hear actual discussion of
sustainability, of reusability and of making use of the resources of the
Moon.]{.underline} However, without a specific plan to set up a lunar
industrial facility---without articulated milestones for material
production---it is meaningless and ephemeral. It will take at least a
generation to undo the captive "close space support" mentality of the
current generation and, through education, build a succeeding generation
of space professionals focused on the strategic dimensions of
spacepower. A push to the lunar surface without a clear plan for
industrial development is a strategic mistake of the first order. [What
matters the to future of American power is not who gets to the Moon or
Mars first, but who can make use of the energy and material resources of
the Moon]{.underline} [to convert to economic power and to the
military-logistical power needed to secure that space commerce from
coercion.]{.underline} Therefore, the most important policy decision is
to decide on the construction of a Lunar Industrial Facility (LIF) that
will build the necessary industrial and logistical components of the new
space economy. That must be done with the private sector, and with the
intention of production at scale. That is not exploration. NASA's
multi-decade tone-deafness to exploitation and industrialization at
scale, versus one-of-a-kind exploration, likely means the United States
cannot entrust the long-term safety of its interests to NASA, which
remains exploration and destination focused. The Department of Defense
has also demonstrated a similar tone-deafness to even military
logistical development, believing that peacetime military offensives and
development of dual-use industries must be "somebody else's job." The
fact that military logistical development of cislunar space has not been
a part of the posture statements of US Strategic Command, of the
Secretary of the Air Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, or Air
Force Space Command demonstrate the extant lack of vision of space as an
independent instrument of national power; it is the most compelling
reason for the push by Congress and the Administration for a dedicated
Space Command and Space Force. However, since the leadership will be the
same actors, neither the Administration nor Congress can be confident
that our military space professionals will secure American interests. It
will take at least a generation to undo the captive "close space
support" mentality of the current generation and, through education,
build a succeeding generation of space professionals focused on the
strategic dimensions of spacepower. Unfortunately, we cannot wait that
long to respond to the extant and growing subversion of our national
security. America, a nation of pioneers, settlers, and entrepreneurs,
seeks a vision meaningful enough to mobilize them. Developing the vast
energy and material resources of the inner solar system for free peoples
is that vision; a new American Dream. The Department of Commerce
certainly appreciates the strategic realities and is willing to lead,
but it lacks the vast publicly-owned facilities of our national labs or
their substantial technical budget and expertise. Therefore, because
energy in the form of fuel, propellant, power, and propulsion are
absolutely central to continued US economic and military advantage, the
Administration should mobilize the Department of Energy to secure
America's future advantage in space. [Given the substantial lead that
the PRC has in their own peacetime military advantage]{.underline}, [the
Administration should]{.underline} not delay in issuing a Space Policy
Directive that puts the Secretary of Energy on the National Space
Council, and tasks them to develop, lead, and execute a strategy to
[ensure American space energy dominance.]{.underline} That Space Policy
Directive should task explicitly the DOE to: Develop (in concert with
NASA, Dept of Commerce, and DoD) plans for a scalable Lunar Industrial
Facility with maximum use of public-private partnerships to develop
mining, benefaction, in-situ manufacture and launch at-scale to be
presented to the National Space Council before January 1, 2020. Develop
a plan to ensure parity and pursue advantage in advanced space nuclear
power and propulsion, ensuring a road to commercial transition with a
flight demonstration of a nuclear thermal rocket no later than 2024.
Develop technologies and commercial providers for cryogenic propellant
depots and extraction of lunar propellant for commercial and government
use with initial operations beginning no later than 2028. Develop
prospecting surveys and technology to access lunar nuclear material
(uranium, thorium, and helium-3) with initial operations beginning in
2028. Develop a plan for a Lunar Industrial Facility to produce 90
percent of the structural mass of components for a 100-megawatt
prototype solar power satellite in GEO by 2034. A vision of space
exploration is too small for America. America, a nation of pioneers,
settlers, and entrepreneurs, seeks a vision meaningful enough to
mobilize them. [Developing the vast energy and material
resources]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [the inner solar system for free
peoples is that vision]{.underline}; a new American Dream. **[This is
the American dream with economic and military consequences large enough
to win or lose the next American century]{.underline}**. **[America has
what it takes to come from behind and win]{.underline}** this vast
frontier of opportunity but it must not delay. The mission of the Energy
Department is **[to ensure America's security and
prosperity]{.underline}** by addressing its energy, environmental, and
nuclear challenges **[through transformative science and technology
solutions.]{.underline}**

International Competition and Cooperation Only the United States has
sent people beyond low Earth orbit, but experts say [U.S. preeminence in
space could be challenged]{.underline}. [China became the third nation
to independently launch a human into orbit]{.underline} in 2003 and its
[capabilities have since grown.]{.underline} The People's Liberation
Army is seen as a driver of the Chinese space program, whose ambitions
include sending people to the moon and building a space station.
[Meanwhile, India launched its first unmanned mission to Mars in late
2013]{.underline}, and its probe entered Mars's orbit in September 2014.
The Indian Space Research Organisation has since reached an agreement
with NASA on subsequent explorations of Mars. Only the United States has
sent people beyond low Earth orbit, but experts say U.S. preeminence in
space could be challenged. Another international mission, the landing of
a European Space Agency probe on a comet, attracted widespread interest
in November 2014. Though the probe was unable to anchor properly due to
a landing mishap, it was still able to send a large amount of valuable
data to scientists. SpaceIL, an Israeli organization, launched a moon
lander in early 2019 that ultimately crashed into the moon.
Nevertheless, the attempt marked the first privately funded moon landing
and made Israel the fourth country to attempt a soft moon landing.
**[Space can also inspire international cooperation]{.underline}**. In
what would be his final speech before the United Nations, in 1963,
President Kennedy asked, "Why should the United States and the Soviet
Union, in preparing for such expeditions, become involved in immense
duplications of research, construction, and expenditure?" Kennedy's
vision eventually materialized with [the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project,
in which U.S. and Russian spacecraft docked for the first
time]{.underline}. Today, [the United States is the ISS's managing
partner]{.underline}, leading fourteen nations in perhaps humanity's
most expensive project. The space agencies of Europe, Russia, and Japan
were also important partners on robotic missions such as the Mars rovers
Spirit and Opportunity. The ISS will likely deorbit in the 2020s, but
many say deeper space missions will need to be international ventures.
The Space Force and Uncertainty Ahead Space policy experts agree that
NASA faces considerable challenges, including new budget pressures,
aging infrastructure, the rise of competing spacefaring nations, and the
lack of a strong national vision for human spaceflight. An independent
assessment by the National Research Council in 2012 noted that a crewed
mission to Mars "has never received sufficient funding to advance beyond
the rhetoric stage." President Trump has maintained that he is committed
to the project. [The Trump administration's push to create a space force
within the military could be a sign that an era of cooperation in space
is ending]{.underline}. In response to Trump's order, Daryl G. Kimball
of the Arms Control Association said, "At worst, it is the first step in
an accelerated competition between the U.S., China and Russia in the
space realm that is going to be more difficult to avert without direct
talks about responsible rules of the road." CFR's Stewart M. Patrick
agrees that "the stage could be set for a Cold War--style space race
that overwhelms any multilateral cooperation." At the same time,
policymakers face a growing number of issues around NASA's present-day
purpose and methods. These include how the agency should balance various
goals, such as driving scientific discovery, enhancing national
security, and developing innovations with commercial benefits; how large
a role the private sector should play; and to what extent NASA can be a
vehicle for international cooperation and diplomacy. Despite these
questions, **[many experts have advocated sustaining U.S. leadership in
space.]{.underline}** "I'm convinced that in this century the **[nations
that lead in the world are going to be those that create new
knowledge.]{.underline}** And **[one of the places where you have a huge
opportunity to create new knowledge will be exploration of the
universe]{.underline}**, **[exploration of the solar system,
and]{.underline}** the **[building of technology that allows you to do
that]{.underline}**," said former congressman and aerospace expert
Robert Walker at a CFR meeting on space policy in 2013.

### Impact -- Arms Good

#### Arms sales are key as a containment policy that fends off China, Russia, and Iran -- reductions would signal withdrawal, disrupting broad coalitions that check revisionism

sg

Together, these differences make today's containment a less urgent
challenge than its Cold War predecessor. [The United States]{.underline}
does not have to deal with a single mortal threat from a country
committed to remaking the entire world in its own image. It [must
address three serious but lesser challenges, mounted by countries
seeking]{.underline} not heaven on earth but [greater regional power and
autonomy]{.underline}. But if [today's challenges]{.underline} are less
epic, they [are far more complicated.]{.underline} The old containment
was simple, if not easy. The new containment will have to blend a
variety of policies, carefully coordinated with one another in design
and execution. This will tax the ingenuity and flexibility of the United
States and its allies. STRONGER TOGETHER As during the Cold War,
**[containment today requires American military deployments
abroad]{.underline}**. In Europe, **[ground troops are needed to deter
Russian aggression]{.underline}**. [The Putin regime has already sent
forces into Georgia and Ukraine. The United States is committed to
protecting its NATO allies. These include the Baltic states, tiny
countries on Russia's border.]{.underline} By defending them, the United
States could encounter some of the same difficulties it did defending
West Berlin, including, in the worst case, having to decide whether to
bring nuclear weapons into play rather than accept military defeat.
**[East Asia requires a robust U.S. naval presence to fend off China's
campaign to dominate the western Pacific]{.underline}.** [The United
States is committed to protecting allies such as Japan, South Korea, and
Taiwan]{.underline} [and maintaining open sea-lanes]{.underline}, and it
conducts what it calls "freedom-of-navigation operations" in
international waters newly claimed by China to make clear that the rest
of the world does not accept Chinese claims and Chinese dominance there.

Middle East, [**American naval and air forces are needed to safeguard
shipments of Persian Gulf oil** to Europe and Asia]{.underline} **[and
to support a successful rollback of the Iranian nuclear
program]{.underline}**, should that become necessary. [American
troops]{.underline} on the ground [are not required; it is local forces
that must check Iranian efforts at regional subversion (which are
carried out by local militias).]{.underline} Diplomatically,
**[Washington needs to maintain]{.underline}** or assemble **[broad
coalitions]{.underline}** of local powers [**to oppose each revisionist
challenge**.]{.underline} In Europe, NATO was created to carry out this
very mission and so should be the pillar of the United States' strategy
there[. In Asia and the Middle East, the "hub and spoke" pattern of
American Cold War alliances still exists,]{.underline} even as regional
powers have begun to collaborate among themselves. [Working with
partners exploits Washington's]{.underline} greatest strength: its
[ability to attract allies and create powerful coalitions]{.underline}
against isolated opponents**[. Coordinating with other countries also
endows American foreign policy with a legitimacy it would otherwise
lack]{.underline}**, showing that the United States is not simply acting
for itself but defending broad principles of international order that
many others support. Working with partners exploits Washington's
greatest strength: its ability to attract allies and create powerful
coalitions against isolated opponents. The [dependence of]{.underline}
the [revisionists on access to the global economy gives the United
States and its coalition partners a potential source of
leverage]{.underline}. [Washington]{.underline} and its allies have
[tried to exploit this through sanctions on Russia]{.underline} for its
invasion of Ukraine, [tariffs on China]{.underline} for its trade
practices, [and sanctions on Iran for its nuclear weapons
program.]{.underline} But interdependence cuts both ways. Russia has
tried to pressure Ukraine by restricting Ukrainian access to Russian
energy. China has placed targeted embargoes on Japan and Norway to
express displeasure with specific Japanese and Norwegian policies.
Moreover, economic instruments have at best a mixed record in achieving
political goals; the broader the sanctioning coalition is, the greater
its impact will be. MAKING IT OFFICIAL [The prospect of a
twenty-first-century triple containment strategy raises several
questions]{.underline}. Since the United States is already doing much of
what is required, how much change in American foreign policy is needed?
Is it necessary or feasible to confront all three revisionist powers at
once? And how does all this end? As for the first, [explicitly
committing the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[to containment would build on many existing policies]{.underline}
[while reframing them as part of a coherent national
strategy]{.underline} rather than the products of inertia or
inattention. A [public commitment]{.underline} [to
containment]{.underline} [would enhance the credibility of American
deterrence]{.underline} [and lower the chance of opportunistic attacks
by opponents]{.underline} hoping for easy gains (as happened in Korea in
1950 and Iraq in 1990). [That]{.underline}, in turn, [would reassure
actual and potential allies and increase their willingness to join the
effort.]{.underline} [Adopting containment as a strategic frame would
also help restrain Washington's occasional impulses to do more (try to
transform other societies) or less (retreat from global engagement
altogether).]{.underline} As for confronting all three at once,
geopolitical logic and historical experience suggest that reducing the
number of threats is the best course, as the United States did by
joining with the Soviet Union to defeat the Nazis and then aligning with
Mao Zedong's China to defeat the Soviet Union. Post-Soviet Russia would
have been a natural partner for the West. But Moscow was needlessly
alienated from its logical geopolitical partnership by NATO expansion,
which brought foreign armies to its doorstep over its objections. At
this point, all three revisionist regimes rely for domestic support on
nationalist hostility to the United States specifically and Western
democracies more generally and reject being part of a U.S.-led
coalition. Fortunately, Russia is much weaker than the Soviet Union,
China is restrained by both deterrence and the knowledge that military
conflict would damage its economy, and Iran is a regional power. So the
United States can afford to pursue the containment of all three
simultaneously (so long as it does so as part of robust coalitions).

sg

[As the world's leading producer]{.underline}, consumer, and exporter
[of high-end weaponry, the United States has long used arms sales to
**influence smaller states, manage regional arms races, encourage
allies'** **inter-operability, and contain rivals'
capabilities**]{.underline}, **[as well as to support its own defense
industrial base and broader economy]{.underline}**. [It equips foreign
militaries]{.underline} not only to defend themselves, but [to use
hardware in common with the United States, making **joint operations**
easier]{.underline}. The governing document for U.S. arms transfers,
[Presidential Decision Directive]{.underline} [27]{.underline} from
2014, [lists ten "national security and foreign policy goals" that such
transfers serve]{.underline}. These range from "**[Ensuring U.S.
military forces, and those of allies and partners, continue to enjoy
technological superiority over potential adversaries" to "Ensuring that
arms transfers do not contribute to human rights violations or
violations of international humanitarian law."]{.underline}** However,
the Trump administration's new initiative threatens to disrupt this
balance and undermine the often useful role that arms sales have played
in U.S. foreign policy. Tina Kaidanow, head of the State Department's
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, recently testified that the Arms
Transfer Initiative not only "bolsters our ability to protect the United
States by being a force multiplier for the U.S. warfighter" but
"ultimately benefits U.S. industry by driving new innovation and
creating high-quality American jobs." But simultaneously linking U.S.
security and American jobs through arms sales, while it may seem
intuitive, rarely works. Indeed, such a policy will carry few economic
benefits, and, if done indiscriminately, undermine what should be **[the
central goal of the nation's arms transfer policy: advancing the
national security of the United States and its partners.]{.underline}**
Many deals that advance U.S. goals will create few jobs in the United
States, while some of the most lucrative, job-creating arms deals can
undermine U.S. interests.

Over the past few weeks, the parts of the world still dependent on
fossil fuels---which is to say, all of them---have anxiously [watched
tensions rise in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow channel between the
oil-rich Persian Gulf and the deepwater shipping channels of the Indian
Ocean.]{.underline} Television broadcasts show images of [U.S. naval
vessels escorting oil tankers through the strait, ensuring that oil and
gas reach their markets]{.underline}. And on the one hand, this is
entirely appropriate and encouraging: The purpose of a navy, after all,
is to safeguard the movement of friendly armies and commerce---and to
deny one's enemies the ability to do the same. On the other hand, the
fact that U.[S. naval vessels are escorting commercial ships in and out
of the Persian Gulf is also an indictment of a U.S. policy initiative

interests.]{.underline} Recently, of course, representatives and
senators from both sides of the aisle have begun to question arms sales
in the Gulf---to our Saudi and Emirati partners, in particular. Appalled
by the loss of civilian life in Yemen and---in the case of Lindsey
Graham, among others---pushed over the edge by the killing of the Saudi
journalist Jamal Khashoggi, they have taken steps to prevent the
administration from providing certain weapons to our traditional
partners. [The administration has responded by invoking a
national-security emergency to continue doing just that, citing the
threat posed by Iran.]{.underline} I'm largely agnostic about the roles
that the legislative and executive branches play in arms sales. I have
more to say, though, about the strategic utility of the arms sales
themselves. From 2015 to 2017, I served as the deputy assistant
secretary of defense for the Middle East, which meant I had oversight of
security-cooperation programs, including foreign-military sales, in the
region. And during an earlier stint at the Pentagon, between 2012 and
2013, I led a project that examined, on a country-by-country basis, what
actual stand-alone military capabilities our partners in the region had
developed since U.S. security-cooperation efforts had really picked up,
in the aftermath of the Gulf War. That project was spurred by a
persistent fantasy among think-tank types of a certain generation: What
if we could build an "Arab NATO" in the Gulf? What if we could build a
military coalition among our Gulf partners to constrain Iran in the same
way we built a Western European military coalition to constrain Russia
during the Cold War? It's easy to see why some people advanced this
idea. First, they were often among the same people who had argued for
removing the most effective actual constraint on the ambitions of the
Islamic Republic of Iran: Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Second, despite in many
cases serving as architects of, or cheerleaders for, [America's greatest
blunder in the post--Cold War era, they retained enough strategic sense
to realize that keeping tens of thousands of U.S. service members in the
Gulf didn't make a lot of sense in a century in which China would
challenge the United States for hegemony in the Pacific.]{.underline}
Indeed, by the time I left the Pentagon in January 2017, we had roughly
35,000 troops in the Gulf alone, and these troops were mostly housed in
semipermanent bases. I used to review the annual construction plans
submitted by U.S. Central Command and marvel at all the concrete we were
pouring into a region that we all knew, in our heads if not our hearts,
should matter less to us in the coming century. I hope the Saudi-led
embargo of Qatar and the self-defeating fracturing of the Gulf
Cooperation Council has finally pounded a wooden stake into the heart of
the Arab NATO vampire, and that future Pentagon desk officers will not
be as tormented as I was. What did we learn, though? Well, a few things.
I'll give you the bad news first, which isn't entirely bad. And then
I'll give you the good news, which isn't entirely good. (Sorry, this is
the Middle East---you need to get used to such ambiguities.) First, let
me be impolite but clear: [**Despite spending billions of dollars on
military hardware, our Gulf partners do not have very good militaries**.
They sport large collections of weapons and equipment---some shiny, some
rusted---but not real capabilities.]{.underline} That's why I raise my
eyebrows when administration officials cite the threat posed by Iran as
a reason to keep arming these partners over the objections of Congress:
[In an actual war with Iran, we would likely not ask our Gulf partners
to do much more than stay out of the way. **We do not, for the most
part, trust their ability to participate in what would be a very
stressful, very challenging, and highly kinetic conflict. The war in
Yemen has been a humanitarian nightmare**]{.underline}, but it has also
been illuminating from the perspective of defense policy. [We can
finally see what our various regional partners]{.underline}---the
Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Bahrainis, the Emiratis---can and cannot do.
[The result has not, for the most part, been pretty.]{.underline} When I
was at the Pentagon in my last job, we determined that the majority of
civilian deaths in Yemen were not caused by crimes of malice but by
crimes of incompetence: [The Saudi-led coalition's air force simply
could not plan and execute an independent air campaign that either
accomplished its strategic objectives or, failing to do that, at least
minimized civilian casualties.]{.underline} The Saudis realized this,
early in the campaign, and they begged us for more help, which we were
reluctant to give, because we didn't want to own any more of their war
in Yemen than we already did---especially when we had a fight against
the Islamic State on our hands and needed all available resources to
defeat it. [Compounding these failures is the fact that our Gulf
partners have largely invested in those areas where they cannot match
the United States]{.underline}, and not in those areas for which the
United States could actually use partner capacity. [They have spent a
lot of money building very expensive air forces, for example, that
largely cannot do what their leaders need them to do. But these
countries]{.underline}---whose economies depend on their ability to move
oil and gas to the market by sea---[haven't spent much money at all on
naval forces that can patrol their sea lanes, or minesweepers that can
reopen those same sea lanes through either the Strait of Hormuz or the
Bab el-Mandeb.]{.underline} That's why you are more likely to see a U.S.
naval vessel escorting an oil tanker through the Strait of Hormuz than
you are to see a Gulf naval vessel. As a U.S. military officer wryly
lamented to me on a visit to one Gulf country, "Out of the three
services here, sir, the navy ranks fourth in terms of priority." But
ground forces don't fare much better. [Like naval surface warfare,
ground combat and the things one has to do to be good at it are not
sexy.]{.underline} You need to be physically fit (which involves running
a lot), spend a lot of time on the rifle range (which involves sweating
a lot), and rehearse battle drills and other collective tasks ad nauseam
(which involve both running and sweating a lot). I once spent five
months doing all that with a light-infantry platoon in the heat of the
Kuwaiti desert and ... well, it's not always fun. [The sun sucks, the
sand sucks, and you're trying to keep a bunch of teenagers focused in
100-degree heat. I get it]{.underline}. Getting shot by the enemy,
though, is less fun, and along the border with Yemen, Saudi ground
forces in particular have proved largely incapable of closing with and
engaging the enemy---which is the entire point of possessing
ground-maneuver forces. [The failure of Saudi and allied ground forces
has contributed to their overreliance on air forces, which have spent
most of the past few decades practicing air-to-air combat (which they're
still not very good at,]{.underline} if we're not grading on a curve)
and were largely unprepared for what they were asked to do over
Yemen---as lots of Yemeni civilians sadly discovered. The silver lining
to all this bad news is that none of our Gulf partners looks ready to
challenge Israel's qualitative military edge anytime soon, individually
or collectively, and we retain some leverage over our partners so long
as they remain reliant on us for their collective defense. The good
news, meanwhile, is that some of our partners in the region---not many,
but some---have developed real and formidable military capabilities. Our
Emirati partners, for example, are able to conduct truly independent
military operations, and their air forces and special forces are capable
of operating alongside ours. They have done so, in fact, over the past
decade---including in Afghanistan. Indeed, one of the things that's
missing from the spate of recent articles bemoaning the influence of the
United Arab Emirates in Washington is the real value proposition that
the Emiratis bring to the table. The reason U.S. military officers,
especially, fall in love with their Emirati counterparts is because the
Emirati crown prince, Mohamed bin Zayed, has invested in actual
capabilities and has military forces the Americans can treat as peers.
Of course, [the danger of helping your partners create independent
military capabilities is that, if you succeed, you've helped your
partners create independent military capabilities]{.underline}. **[They
may use their newfound capabilities---from Yemen to Libya---in support
of strategic aims that diverge from your own]{.underline}**. (In Yemen,
our Emirati friends have discovered something that we ourselves were
reminded of in Iraq and Afghanistan: Operational excellence alone is
often not enough to realize strategic victory.) So why does the current
administration fight so hard to keep arming our partners in the Gulf? I
don't think it's as simple as the need to support the U.S. military
industrial base, though that is a concern I'm sure it has. [Some U.S.
strategists genuinely fear that if we do not arm our partners, our
Russian or Chinese rivals will.]{.underline} They can't cite that fear
to justify the "emergency" that allows us to continue arming the Saudis
and Emiratis over congressional objections, because it's more of a
strategic concern, but based on my conversations with U.S., Saudi, and
Emirati officials, it's a major driver of American policy. I'm just not
sure that is a good-enough reason. [Russia and China cannot, in the near
term, rival the numbers of personnel we have deployed in the region.
None of our partners is going to call the Chinese military to save them
from the Iranian navy.]{.underline} So we should probably stop being so
scared of the Russian or Chinese bogeymen, no matter how much our
partners might publicly flirt with our rivals. One of the reasons they
do that, after all, is because [their strategic interests diverge from
ours: We want to rebalance our resources toward future security
challenges, while they want to keep as many of our forces tied down in
their region as possible.]{.underline} Going forward, we can afford to
focus on building our allies' capacity only when we expect to reap a
direct benefit. Especially following large recent sales of aircraft to
Saudi Arabia (F-15s), Kuwait (F-18s), and Qatar (F-15s), [we've probably
sold enough advanced fighter aircraft to the region]{.underline}. The
Saudis and others will claim they now need F-35s and F-22s to deter
Iran, but there is no evidence to suggest that Iran has been in any way
deterred by the fourth-generation fighters, so [I'm not sure why
fifth-generation fighter aircraft would suddenly cause Qasem Soleimani &
Co. to change their behavior.]{.underline} We need to help our allies
build capabilities that will allow the United States to do less, and
that largely means building up naval forces and integrated air and
missile defenses---another rare bright spot in U.S. capacity-building
efforts (at least until the Gulf militaries all stopped talking to
Qatar, home to the largest U.S. air base in the region). You want to
sell weapons to the Gulf? Fine. But sell them some frigates and air
defenses. That's not going to be easy for two reasons: First, unlike
Egypt or Lebanon or Israel, [the Gulf militaries are not the
beneficiaries of U.S. largesse in the form of foreign military
financing, a mechanism whereby we give countries funds to spend on U.S.
weapons and training]{.underline}. The Gulf states have their own
dollars that they can spend as they like, and they don't have to spend
those dollars on U.S. weapons. If we don't sell them a certain weapon
system, they can buy a similar one elsewhere. But they do so at their
own risk. If you buy a bunch of Chinese drones and allow Chinese
engineers to walk around your air bases, it will not be long before
those U.S. aircraft and U.S. military personnel find another base. And
our Gulf partners don't want that. They like keeping us close. Second,
[our Gulf partners have been masterful at scaring the wits out of
successive U.S. administrations,]{.underline} by suggesting they fear we
will abandon them. Condoleezza Rice, for example, came back from a
meeting with the late King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in the second term
of the George W. Bush administration, alarmed by the king's worry the
United States was leaving the region---this at a time in which we had
150,000 troops in Iraq alone. [That fear helped spark what has now been
a decade-long push to sell more U.S. weapons to our Gulf partners,
increasing interoperability and thus deepening the bilateral ties
between our respective militaries.]{.underline} But our Gulf partners
will always claim we are abandoning the region; even permanently
relocating the XVIII Airborne Corps to Kuwait would not change that.
They did it during the Bush administration, they did it during the Obama
administration, and I bet they are doing it today, during the Trump
administration. That fear is grounded in a clear-eyed view of our
presence in the region. They can see it makes little sense---not in our
current numbers. They know, in their hearts, that we have bigger
priorities elsewhere. If only our hearts knew the same.

#### Arms sales are bad for American hegemony:

#### Blowback and entanglement -- makes American intervention in foreign countries likely

[**Arms Sales Have Many Potential Negative Consequences**]{.underline}
Though arms sales are of marginal value to national security and the
pursuit of national interests, their negative consequences are varied
and often severe. [Arms sales can spawn unwanted outcomes]{.underline}
on three levels[: blowback against the United States and entanglement in
conflicts; regional consequences]{.underline} in the buyer's
neighborhood, [such as the dispersion of weapons and increased
instability; and]{.underline} consequences for the buyer itself, such as
[increased levels of corruption, human rights abuses, and civil
conflict]{.underline}. Effects on the United States. Though the goal of
[arms sales]{.underline} is to promote American security and U.S.
interests abroad, at least two possible outcomes [can cause serious
consequences for the United States]{.underline}. The first of these ---
**[blowback]{.underline} --- [occurs when a former ally turns into an
adversary and uses the weapons against the United
States]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} The second ---
[entanglement]{.underline} --- [is a process whereby an arms sales
relationship draws the United States into a greater level of unwanted
intervention]{.underline}. Blowback. [The fact that the United States
has sold weapons to almost every nation]{.underline} on earth, combined
with frequent military intervention, [means that blowback is an
inescapable outcome]{.underline} of U.S. arms sales policy. American
troops and their allies have faced American-made weapons in almost every
military engagement since the end of the Cold War, including in Panama,
Haiti, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria. And even where the
United States has not yet engaged in combat, [American arms sales have
bolstered the military capabilities of adversaries once counted as
friendly.]{.underline} Blowback can occur in at least three ways.
[First, a previously friendly regime becomes unfriendly]{.underline}.
[For example, the United States sold billions of dollars in weapons to
the Shah of Iran during the 1970s in the hopes that Iran would provide a
stabilizing influence]{.underline} on the Middle East. The sales
included everything from fighter jets for air campaigns to
surface-to-air missiles to shoot down enemy fighters.70
[After]{.underline} the [1979]{.underline} revolution, [however, Iran
used those weapons in its war with Iraq and enabled the new Iranian
regime to exert its influence in the region.]{.underline} Panama, the
recipient of decades of American military assistance, as well as host to
a major military base and 9,000 U.S. troops, was a similar case. In
1989, Gen. Manuel Noriega --- himself a CIA asset for more than 20 years
--- took power and threatened U.S. citizens, prompting a U.S. invasion
that featured American troops facing American weapons.71 [Blowback also
occurs when the United States sells weapons to nations]{.underline} (or
transfers them to nonstate actors) [that]{.underline}, though not
allies, [simply did not register as potential adversaries at the time of
the sale]{.underline}. The United States, [for example]{.underline},
sold surface-to-air missiles, towed guns, tanks, and armored personnel
carriers to [Somalia]{.underline} during the 1980s. [Few officials would
have imagined that the United States would find itself intervening in
Somalia in 1992]{.underline}, or that the United States and its allies
would provide billions in weapons and dual-use equipment to Iraq in an
effort to balance against Iran, only to wind up confronting Iraq on the
battlefield to reverse its annexation of Kuwait.72 And [finally,
blowback can occur when U.S. weapons are sold or stolen from the
government that bought them and wind up]{.underline} on the battlefield
[in the hands of the adversary.]{.underline} For example, [the Reagan
administration covertly provided]{.underline} Stinger [missiles to the
Mujahideen]{.underline}, who were fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan
during the 1980s; [they in turn sold them off eventually to Iran and
North Korea]{.underline}, among others. More recently, the Islamic State
managed to capture from the Iraqi government a stunning number of
Humvees and tanks the United States had sold to Iraq to rebuild its
military capabilities after the 2003 invasion, as well as enough small
arms and ammunition to supply three divisions of a conventional army.73
[These examples of blowback demonstrate]{.underline} how difficult it
can be to forecast the long-term outcomes of arms sales and [how obvious
it is that selling weapons carries a number of risks.]{.underline}
Predicting what exactly will happen is hard, but predicting that arms
sales to clients with red flags are likely to end badly is quite easy.
[Iraq was a fragile state ravaged by a decade's worth of American
intervention and rife with terrorism and civil conflict]{.underline}; to
transfer such large quantities of weapons to its military and police
force under such conditions was to invite disaster. Entanglement. [Arms
sales raise the risk of entanglement]{.underline} in two ways. [First,
they can represent early steps down the slippery slope to unwise
military intervention]{.underline}. Consider a case like the Syrian
civil war or the many cases during the Cold War in which the United
States wanted to support rebels and freedom fighters against oppressive
governments.74 In the majority of those cases, American leaders were
wary of intervening directly. Instead, the United States tended to rely
on money, training, and arms sales. But [by taking concrete steps like
arms sales to support rebel groups]{.underline}, [Washington's
psychological investment in the outcome tends to rise, as do the
political stakes for the president, who will be judged]{.underline} on
whether his efforts at support are successful or not. [As we saw in the
Syrian civil war]{.underline}, for example, Barack [Obama's early
efforts to arm Syrian rebels were]{.underline} roundly
[criticized]{.underline} as feckless, [increasing pressure on him to
intervene more seriously]{.underline}.75 History does not provide much
guidance about how serious the risk of this form of entanglement might
be. During the Cold War, presidents from Nixon onward viewed arms sales
as a substitute for sending American troops to do battle with communist
forces around the world. The result was an astonishing amount of
weaponry transferred or sold to Third World nations, many of which were
engaged in active conflicts both external and internal. The risk of
superpower conflict made it dangerous to intervene directly;
accordingly, the Cold War-era risk of entanglement from arms sales was
low.76 [Today]{.underline}, however, [the United States does not face
nearly as many constraints on its behavior]{.underline}, as its track
record of near-constant military intervention since the end of the Cold
War indicates. **[As a result, the risk of arms sales helping trigger
future military intervention is real]{.underline}**, even if it cannot
be measured precisely. [The second way in which arms sales might
entangle the United States is by creating new disputes or exacerbating
existing tensions. U.S. arms sales to Kurdish units]{.underline}
fighting in Syria against the Islamic State, for example, [have ignited
tensions between the United States and its NATO ally
Turkey]{.underline}, which sees the Kurds as a serious threat to Turkish
sovereignty and stability.77 [Meanwhile]{.underline}, [ongoing arms
sales to NATO nations]{.underline} and to other allies like South Korea
and Taiwan [have exacerbated tensions with Russia, China, and North
Korea, raising the risk of escalation]{.underline} and the possibility
that the United States might wind up involved in a direct conflict.78

#### Regional war -- arms prolong & intensify ongoing conflicts rather than promote peace

**Thrall & Dorminey 18** \[Trevor Thrall is a senior fellow for the Cato
Institute's Defense and Foreign Policy Department and an associate
professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and

sg

Regional Effects. [Arms sales]{.underline} do not just affect the
recipient nation; they [also affect the local balance of
power]{.underline}, often [causing ripple effects]{.underline}
throughout the region. Though advocates of arms sales trumpet their
stabilizing influence, as we have noted above, **[arms sales often lead
to greater tension, less stability, and more conflict]{.underline}**.
Because of this --- and the complementary problem of weapons dispersion
--- the regional impact of arms sales is less predictable and more
problematic than advocates acknowledge. Instability, Violence, and
Conflict. First, [arms sales can make conflict more
likely]{.underline}.79 This may occur [because recipients of new weapons
feel more confident about launching attacks or because changes in the
local balance of power can fuel tensions]{.underline} [and promote
preventive strikes]{.underline} by others. A study of arms sales from
1950 to 1995, for example, found that although arms sales appeared to
have some restraining effect on major-power allies, they had the
opposite effect in other cases, and concluded that "**[increased arms
transfers from major powers make states significantly more likely to be
militarized dispute initiators]{.underline}**."80 Another study focused
on sub-Saharan Africa from 1967 to 1997 found that "arms transfers are
significant and positive predictors of increased probability of war."81
Recent history provides supporting evidence for these findings: since
2011, Saudi Arabia, the leading buyer of American weapons, has
intervened to varying degrees in Yemen, Tunisia, Syria, and Qatar.
Second, **[arms sales can also prolong and intensify ongoing conflicts
and erode rather than promote regional stability]{.underline}**. Few
governments, and fewer insurgencies, have large enough weapons stocks to
fight for long without resupply.82 [The tendency of external powers to
arm the side they support]{.underline}, however understandable
strategically, [has the inevitable result of allowing the conflict to
continue at a higher level of intensity than would otherwise be the
case]{.underline}. As one study of arms sales to Africa notes, "Weapons
imports are essential additives in this recipe for armed conflict and
carnage."83 [Third]{.underline}, [this dynamic appears to be
particularly troublesome with respect to internal
conflicts]{.underline}. Jennifer Erickson, for example, found that
[recipients of major conventional weapons are 70 percent more likely to
engage in internal conflicts than other states]{.underline}. Though
halting arms sales alone is not a panacea for peace and stability, arms
embargoes can help lessen the destructiveness of combat in both civil
and interstate wars simply by restricting access to the means of
violence.84 [Finally]{.underline}, because of their effects on both
interstate and internal conflict, [arms sales can also erode rather than
promote regional stability.]{.underline} As noted in the previous
section, [where the United States seeks to manage regional balances of
power]{.underline}, [arms sales often create tension, whether because
the American role in the region threatens others or because American
clients feel emboldened.]{.underline} The Middle East, for example, has
seesawed between violence and tense standoffs for the past many decades,
at first because of Cold War competition and more recently because of
the American war on terror. The notion that increased U.S. arms sales
since 9/11 made the Middle East more stable is far-fetched to say the
least. Similarly, though many argue that American security commitments
to countries like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have produced greater
stability, there is a strong case to be made that the opposite is now
true. [American support of South Korea has driven North Korea to develop
nuclear weapons; the presence of U.S. missile defense systems in South
Korea has aggravated China, and American support of Taiwan produces
continual tension between the two powers]{.underline}.85

#### National instability -- arms feed corruption & violent oppression in recipient nations

Regime Effects. Finally, [arms sales can also have deleterious effects
on recipient nations]{.underline} --- [promoting government oppression,
instability, and military coups]{.underline}. As part of the war on
drugs, America inadvertently enabled the practice of forced
disappearances. [In the cases of Colombia, the Philippines, and Mexico,
American weapons feed a dangerous cycle of corruption and oppression
involving the police]{.underline}, the [military]{.underline}, [and
political leaders]{.underline}.94 Though the United States provides
weapons to Mexico ostensibly for counternarcotics operations, the [arms
transferred to the country often end up being used by police to oppress
citizens]{.underline}, reinforcing the "climate of generalized violence
in the country \[that\] carries with it grave consequences for the rule
of law."95 Similarly, in Colombia and the Philippines the United States
has supplied arms in an effort to support governments against external
threats or internal factions and to combat drug trafficking, but with
mixed results. A study of military aid to Colombia found that "[in
environments such as Colombia, international military assistance can
strengthen armed nonstate actors, who rival the government over the use
of violence]{.underline}."96 Recent research reveals that [American
assistance programs, like foreign military officer training, can
increase the likelihood of military coups]{.underline}. U.S. training
programs frequently bought by other nations, most notably International
Military Education and Training (IMET), gave formal training to the
leaders of the 2009 Honduran coup, the 2012 Mali coup, and the 2013
Egyptian coup.97 In these cases, **[the training that was supposed to
stabilize the country provided military leaders with the tools to
overthrow the government they were meant to support.]{.underline}**

## Heg Sustainable

### Sustainable -- Top Level

#### Hegemony is sustainable -- policies are formed within an existing security framework and influenced by an elite class of experts --that constrains Trump's effect and subsumes public disinvestment

Studies at the University of Exeter, Academic Director of Strategy and
Security Institute and Senior Associate Fellow at RUSI, "Why America\'s
Grand Strategy Has Not Changed: Power, Habit, and the U.S. Foreign
Policy Establishment," 5/4/18, *International Security,* Volume 42 \|

I argue that [an interaction of power and habit makes U.S. grand
strategy stable]{.underline}. By "power," I mean a state\'s relative
economic size and military capabilities. By "habit," I mean collective
ideas that come to seem obvious, axiomatic choices made from unexamined
assumptions.10 Material power may enable the United States to pursue
primacy. [Habitual ideas]{.underline}, however, [make U.S. grand
strategy hard to change]{.underline}. [These habits are perpetuated by a
foreign policy establishment known as the "Blob."]{.underline} A
nickname popularized by former Deputy National Security Adviser Benjamin
Rhodes, the Blob comprises [a class of officials and commentators who
worry incessantly about the "collapse of the American security
order."]{.underline}11 [The Blob emerged from World War II,]{.underline}
as the United States\' rising power generated a demand for security
expertise. [U.S. government officials turned to a group of experts who
formed into a cohesive, influential class]{.underline}. Their commitment
to primacy became an article of faith. As a grand strategy, primacy
warrants scrutiny. It demands significant upfront investments,
implicates national security in developments far and wide, and makes the
United States prone to the frequent use of force.12 Yet [the Blob\'s
achievement was to erect primacy as the seemingly natural framework of
U.S. diplomacy]{.underline}. [The pervasive ideology of U.S. leadership
constrains Washington\'s foreign policy choices.]{.underline} Successive
presidents have been predisposed toward the status quo with little
critical evaluation. Alternative strategies based on the retrenchment of
commitments are effectively taken off the table. [For U.S. grand
strategy to change, two developments would need to combine: rapidly
changing material conditions]{.underline}, shocking enough to disconfirm
the assumptions of the status quo, [and determined agents of change
willing to incur domestic costs to drive it]{.underline}. Absent these
developments, Washington is likely to remain committed to primacy. I
test my argument by examining two cases. The first is the presidency of
Bill Clinton (1993--2001). The Clinton administration had discretionary
power to choose an alternative grand strategy and strong incentives to
consider change. Yet Clinton preserved primacy in its essentials. The
second case is the first year of [the presidency of Donald
Trump]{.underline}. Trump [challenged the bipartisan consensus that the
United States should lead the world.]{.underline} He threatened to shred
alliances, abandon commitments, and tolerate horizontal nuclear
proliferation. [Even in this case,]{.underline} my argument accords with
preliminary observations[. The Blob asserted itself.]{.underline}
Existing accounts of U.S. grand strategy provide some explanation of
continuity, but are inadequate. Structural interpretations rightly
highlight the importance of objective power realities that allow the
United States to pursue primacy in the first place. The distribution of
material capabilities is only a permissive condition, however, enabling
the pursuit of primacy, not causing it. In earlier periods, when the
United States was ascendant, it passed up opportunities to increase its
power. [Structural interpretations also fail to explain why Washington
selects traditional ways of maximizing power over others, balancing
rather than buck-passing, retaining alliances, and fighting peripheral
wars.]{.underline} Domestic-level explanations rightly incorporate
ideas, but also struggle to explain U.S. grand strategy. They predict
more change than has actually happened. Those that emphasize the content
of ideas mostly treat grand strategy as a deliberative planning process
of cost-benefit calculation, where the United States selects primacy
against competing alternatives in an open contest. As I demonstrate, a
rigorously self-conscious process is mostly absent from U.S. foreign
policy decisionmaking circles. Some observers acknowledge that grand
strategic debate in Washington is sterile.13 Yet the question of how an
organically evolving grand strategy emerges from the interaction of
policy agents and external conditions remains undertheorized. The power
of habit helps explain this process by showing why some policy ideas do
or do not receive a hearing in debates designed to chart a course in
response to external circumstances. I thus help connect systemic- and
domestic-level theories of grand strategy by showing how the
policymaking process itself is shaped by prior events alongside
individual and group beliefs. This article proceeds in four sections. I
begin by offering a deductive argument that explains the stability of
U.S. grand strategy, and then derive predictions about U.S. behavior
since the Cold War. Next, I demonstrate how this argument explains
continuities in U.S. diplomatic behavior in the Clinton era and the
first year of Trump\'s presidency. In the conclusion, I forecast that
primacy will prove resilient. Power and Habit in Washington [Why is U.S.
grand strategy hard to change, even when conditions change?]{.underline}
To understand why, it is necessary to examine not only what
decisionmakers think about, but where they think from. [Habit is a type
of path dependency]{.underline}, the process [where]{.underline}by
[prior historical developments limit the scope of choices set before
decisionmakers, reproducing behavior even in the absence of the
conditions where it began.]{.underline} **[States move]{.underline}**
not from a neutral zero but **[from legacies that prescribe what is
legitimate and effective.]{.underline}** The logic of habit is distinct
from the logic of consequences, where actors consciously make
instrumental cost-benefit calculations, and the logic of
appropriateness, where agents choose with conscious reference to rules
and norms. It is distinct from bureaucratic politics theory, where
policy is the outcome of bargaining within government, with officials
driven by organizational and personal interests.14 To say that habit
drives U.S. grand strategy is to suggest that policymakers become
unreflective and non-deliberative about the framework within which
decisions are made. The process is not automatic, but **[prior beliefs
about the United States\' place in the international order mostly set
the agenda and impose tight parameters within which bureaucratic
politics play out.]{.underline}** Habituated decisionmakers are
insufficiently stimulated by changing conditions. They deliberate mostly
within the boundaries of traditional rationales. A "common sense"
mediates between the environment and decisionmakers, turning what were
once calculated choices into axiomatic ones.15 Winston Churchill, for
instance, invoked Britain\'s "unconscious tradition" of supporting
weaker states "to oppose the strongest, most aggressive" powers in
continental Europe.16 The process of habituation manifests itself
negatively and positively. Negatively, it takes the form of
self-censorship, with senior policymakers sidestepping reevaluation of
first-order questions. Scrutiny will be absent even where one should
most expect it, within authoritative institutions charged with examining
choices. Policy discussion will mostly be conducted through an
operational mind-set, confined to issues of implementation. Positively,
habit functions as a conformist pressure visibly applied to officials
who question assumptions. When officials question basic assumptions,
gatekeepers with privileged access, expert status, and agenda-setting
power will discipline discussion. Where does the habit of primacy come
from? In the final years of World War II, the United States rapidly
became the most powerful nation on Earth.17 With other major powers
exhausted by war, it experienced unprecedented industrial expansion. Its
gross domestic product doubled. It enjoyed the world\'s highest per
capita productivity. It dominated the world\'s gold reserves and became
the largest creditor and exporter. The dollar was the reserve currency.
It had a monopoly on atomic weapons. Its long-range bombers, carrier
task forces, and bases gave it unrivaled reach. There was worldwide
demand for its loans, arms, and patronage. The United States recognized,
as any state would, its vastly increased power position. This growth in
relative power enabled the United States to enlarge its ambitions and
reorder the international system. Its rise amid the dangers of conflict
generated demand for security experts. America at war became a national
security state, organizing intensively to mobilize and project power.
The global disorder of the 1930s and 1940s had already prompted an
intellectual rediscovery of strategy, with security experts urging the
United States to realize its latent strength and flex its geopolitical
muscles.18 Experts then urged Washington to translate victory into
hegemony, under a Washington-designed world order,19 assuming that the
United States would "succeed Britain as the military and economic
guarantor and moral leader of the world."20 This Washington did in
concrete form, placing large parts of the globe under U.S. military
commands, reshaping the global economy through U.S.-designed
institutions, and creating a security bureaucracy. [Out of this process
emerged a cohesive U.S. foreign policy elite. This elite advanced major
policies]{.underline}, [from]{.underline} the postwar revival of Western
Europe\'s economies and [the formation of]{.underline} the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}) [to the creation of a
National Economic Council.]{.underline} The establishment was
demoralized by the Vietnam War and economic malaise in the late 1960s
and early 1970s, but rebuilt itself on the back of Ronald Reagan\'s
presidency.21 It often gets its way. As research demonstrates, "the
gravitational pull" on foreign policy decisions by the foreign policy
establishment tends to be "stronger than the attraction of public
opinion."22 The foreign policy establishment is not monolithic. Its
members dispute issues below the grand strategic level, such as human
rights, the extent of multilateral cooperation, democracy promotion, and
specific interventions. Until the 1960s, it was mostly a patrician,
predominantly white, Protestant class that internalized values nurtured
"in prep schools, at college clubs, in the boardrooms of Wall Street,
and at dinner parties."23 It then incorporated nonwhites, women,
first-generation immigrants, Jews, and Roman Catholics, to form a more
heterogeneous class of coastal internationalists, oriented around the
Ivy League. Still, this cross-section of internationalist elites is
united by a consensus. [They want the United States to remain engaged in
upholding world order. They are primacists. They fear U.S. retreat from
overseas responsibilities and warn that abandonment would lead to the
return of rival power blocs, economic stagnation, and catastrophe. They
have established primacy as the only viable, legitimate grand strategy,
and as an ingrained set of ideas, while installing themselves as
insiders, positioned to steer the state.]{.underline} The Blob
reproduces its ideology through four causal mechanisms. [First, security
elites accumulate knowledge about how grand strategy
succeeds]{.underline} and form mental shortcuts that they repeat and
internalize[. Second, they socialize personnel into their
worldview]{.underline}, educating and selecting individuals who conform,
excluding or penalizing those who do not, and linking conformity to an
axiomatic worldview with insider status; they also dominate the pool of
experienced talent that makes up officialdom. They have privileged
access to power via an institutional revolving door, a set of social
networks, and institutions---the locations where grand strategic ideas
intervene at the unit level, between appointments in government through
to foundations, think tanks, universities, and bodies from the Council
on Foreign Relations to the Trilateral Commission.24 New presidential
administrations will often retain career security officials for the sake
of continuity. As the cohorts of qualified officialdom are socialized
into orthodoxy, even presidents who wish to institute change will be
drawn to select from that pool[. The Blob has close ties to corporate
networks]{.underline}. Fifteen of Clinton\'s key policymakers, according
to one study, had a total of forty-one corporate affiliations, breeding
an instinctive sympathy toward the penetration of transnational
capital,25 which was reflected in Clinton\'s goal of "open and equal
U.S. access to foreign markets."26 [Third, the Blob dominates public
discourse and sets its agenda]{.underline}, through privileged access to
the commentariat, of which it forms a part. Presidential candidates
routinely approach establishment figures at think tanks to formulate
their foreign policy manifestos. They define the terms of debate,
delegitimizing alternative strategies as alien and foolish. [They
present alternatives to primacy, involving retrenchment or the avoidance
of war, in binary terms as retreat or isolationism.]{.underline}
[Fourth, they exert influence via a transnational pathway]{.underline},
supplying allies with ideas that those allies repeat, creating a
feedback loop. The Blob itself is candid about its privileged access to
state power. For Richard Haass, former director of the Policy Planning
Staff, [think tanks constitute an "informal shadow foreign affairs
establishment."]{.underline} As Haass once observed, "Madeleine
Albright, Colin Powell\'s predecessor as Secretary of State, once headed
the Center for National Policy. Her former deputy, Strobe Talbott, is
now president of the Brookings Institution---where I previously served
as vice-president and director of foreign policy studies.... I\'ve
alternated stints at the National Security Council, the Defense and
State Departments, and on Capitol Hill with time at Brookings, the
International Institute for Strategic Studies, the Council on Foreign
Relations, and the Carnegie Endowment."27 [Self-identified members of
the Blob acknowledge the conformist pressures that this policy
environment creates.]{.underline} Leslie Gelb confessed he supported the
invasion of Iraq in 2003 out of the "disposition and incentives to
support wars to retain political and professional credibility."28 Derek
Chollet observes an "ecosystem" that incentivizes support for activism
and delegitimizes arguments for restraint.29 Michael Mandelbaum notes
that the establishment defines the policy "ballpark," setting boundaries
for "what may be legitimately proposed and carried out."30 Contrary to
theories that the marketplace of ideas ensures rigorous weighing of
choices, the suggestions of those outside the security establishment
rarely penetrate foreign policy decisionmaking.31 If **[habit often
shapes grand strategy by inhibiting actors from revising
it]{.underline}**, how do grand strategies change? [Alteration happens
normally through an interaction of two variables: rapidly changing
external conditions]{.underline} [sufficiently shocking to
disconfirm]{.underline} the assumptions of [the status quo, and
determined agents of change willing to incur domestic costs to drive
it.]{.underline} A good example is Great Britain\'s postwar abandonment
of empire. External conditions had turned against the maintenance of
colonies, through the cumulative fiscal pressures of World War II; a
growing decolonization resistance; the United States\' dismantling of
the economic order of imperial preference and the sterling bloc; and the
shock of the Suez crisis of 1956, which revealed Britain\'s
vulnerability to U.S. coercion. Domestically, successive governments
redefined Britain\'s status around alliances and nuclear weapons,
presenting retreat from empire as a graceful management of change and
casting the emergence of independent countries as "the crowning
achievement of British rule."32 Short of external circumstances quite so
overwhelming as those confronting postwar Britain, grand strategic
change remains possible but difficult. For the United States, the major
interruption to its traditional strategy was the Richard Nixon
administration.33 When Nixon became president, multiple pressures---
including the Vietnam War, the oil embargo imposed by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries, inflation, an imbalance of payments,
and racial conflict at home---were eroding the United States\'
international supremacy. Nixon was determined to shift Washington toward
accepting stable multipolarity, particularly through his opening to
China and his treatment of the Soviet Union as a permanent partner in a
post-hegemonic world order, downplaying and at times abandoning nuclear
counterproliferation as a priority, and pursuing hard-line
realpolitik.34 To achieve this objective, Nixon and his national
security adviser, Henry Kissinger, issued public explanations to
legitimize their shift. They also made policy secretly and obstructed
oversight, by turns excluding, deflecting, or dominating the national
security bureaucracy, State Department, and Congress, to concentrate
power among a small coterie of presidential advisers. This project
attracted strong opposition. By the time of President Gerald Ford, it
had unraveled. [Grand strategic change is therefore rare. Hardwired
beliefs are resistant to change.]{.underline}35 **[Major powers can
retrench in order to adjust]{.underline}** to adversity, **[but they
often fall prey to adjustment failure and overreach.]{.underline}**36
People revise habits only when contradictory information is received
dramatically and in large batches, making them realize they cannot
assimilate those shocks into their worldview. Japan\'s attack on Pearl
Harbor in 1941 is an example of a shocking event discrediting
established orthodoxy. [U.S. primacy, and the confidence that the United
States possesses vast latent power, is especially resilient to
shocks.]{.underline} [The country\'s relative strength is almost
unparalleled in history and enables a story hard to
falsify]{.underline}. **[It predisposes policymakers to interpret
disasters]{.underline}**---such as the terrorist attacks of September
11, 2001---**[as caused by an insufficiency of U.S. dominance and as
evidence of the need for more.]{.underline}** The "Bush Doctrine,"
triggered by those attacks, unapologetically reasserted primacy and
revived U.S. traditions of preventive war.37 Washington keeps its core
commitments even in the wake of setbacks. Based on the deductive
argument I have set out, [I offer a prediction about U.S. grand
strategy]{.underline} since the United States became the world\'s sole
superpower. **[There will be an essential continuity]{.underline}** in
the decades after the Cold War. **[The four parts of that grand
strategy]{.underline}**---preponderance, reassurance, integration, and
nuclear inhibition---**[will persist despite shifts between
presidencies, a changing political balance in Congress, economic change
and demands for re-allocation of resources, a more benign threat
environment, and a public increasingly averse to the costs of
primacy]{.underline}**. With the Soviet Union gone as the last major
check on its power, [the United States will look to realize its
long-held goal of unrivaled dominance.]{.underline} No fundamental
review of its grand strategy will occur, despite incentives and
opportunities for revision. [The policy process within the executive
branch]{.underline}, the branch that directs U.S. statecraft, commands
military forces, and makes treaties, [will be disciplined by
gatekeepers, and public grand-strategic debate will hardly
intrude]{.underline}. An operational mind-set, or the "how" and "when,"
will overshadow "whether." [Allies of the United States will encourage
and reinforce the reigning ideology.]{.underline}

[The United States has been a global leader in the development
cooperation field for an extended period of time.]{.underline} Thus far,
despite a disturbing general attack on the rules-based international
system by the current U.S. administration, country partners,
international organizations, and other donors still look to the United
States for leadership. Yet preeminence is ephemeral, built partly on
historic inertia, partly on perception, and partly on real results.
Indeed, [inertia may be the key factor maintaining the U.S. position
today]{.underline}. Yet more is at play than that, including a Congress
that is resisting isolationism and deep budget cuts in the foreign
affairs budget accounts. Political antecedents [The U.S. development
cooperation experiment grew out of both self-interest and
altruism.]{.underline} Concerns over the threat of communism motivated
many who supported the Truman Doctrine and its assistance to Greece and
Turkey and the even more ambitious Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe that
followed. These programs from the 1940s were influenced by the Soviet
Union's expansionist intentions; yet there was also strong popular
support for ending the humanitarian crisis faced by European nations,
even the defeated Germany. Feeding those devastated by war and
reconstructing the essential elements of functioning economies were
central both to alleviating suffering and containing the communist
threat. A bipartisan consensus assumed a strong and integrated Europe
served U.S. economic and security interests. That a foreign assistance
program of the magnitude of the Marshall Plan was in the national
interest did not detract from its humanitarian impact. It may not have
been conceived as "the most unsordid act in history" (as Winston
Churchill purportedly said), but its effect was both lifesaving and
practical. As the late University of Minnesota scholar Vernon Ruttan
observed in his seminal work on the antecedents of the U.S. aid program,
United States Development Assistance Policy, "American exceptionalism"
was a powerful theme in popular political culture. According to Ruttan,
this perspective "spawned two conflicting doctrines." One was the
liberal ideal in which America's role is "to lead the world...into a
more democratic and prosperous future." The other was a realist
doctrine, "that a virtuous America, prosperous and democratic, is
continuously threatened with contamination by the anti-democratic and
corrupt Old World (and, one might add, by extreme ideologies)." Ruttan
asserts that these two conflicting doctrines, a desire for security, and
a need to promote values, "have exerted a powerful influence on U.S.
assistance policy from the beginning."The two doctrines have co-existed
for most of our post-WWII history. The emphasis has evolved, depending
on presidential administrations and the nature of perceived global
threats, but the blend of security concerns and the desire to create a
global community in our image provide political support for American
development assistance. Point Four: Soft power's hesitant beginning in a
bi-polar world This blend of security concerns and humanitarianism was
conspicuous in [President Harry Truman]{.underline}'s inaugural address
in 1949. After listing three security-related initiatives, Truman
surprised many by adding a fourth "soft power" concept. He [urged the
United States to "embark on a bold new program for making the benefits
of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the
improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas."]{.underline} Averell
Harriman was selected by Truman to run the new Mutual Security Agency.
During this period, the security focus was front and center. Despite its
idealistic birth, Point Four aid was relatively short-term and typically
directed at countries on the periphery of the Soviet Union or China.
Harold Stassen took over the post in the Eisenhower administration and
called for a US\$2 billion cut in the program, telling the Senate
Appropriations Committee, "We are seeking more defense, more rapidly,
with less dollars, lasting longer (a reference to his estimate that
protecting countries against communism might take 10 years)." Later,
Stassen, who was also assigned the task of strengthening the new United
Nations and giving it an aid-giving capacity, began to express concern
that the administration had been pre-occupied with military solutions at
the expense of economic ones. The Mutual Security Agency was the vehicle
for the realist doctrine as it combined security assistance with an aid
program influenced primarily by geo-strategic objectives. This was a
program driven by ideological competition; development was given
secondary importance, if it was even understood as a concept. The
intentions of Truman's Point Four program were largely lost as hot and
cold war and the communist threat preoccupied the Eisenhower
administration. Efforts to use limited resources to "aid the poor" were
often awkward, culturally insensitive parodies of what passes for
development today. It was in the 1950s that the moniker "Ugly American"
took hold, further damaging the case for a program that could
successfully advance development only by working with partners over
time. The Kennedy administration and development diplomacy [The shift
toward the "liberal idealist" approach accelerated dramatically with the
inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961. Military and economic aid were
separated, as the Mutual Security Agency became the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID)]{.underline}. The Peace Corps was
born and the administration gave great prominence to an Alliance for
Progress in Latin America. This coincided with a global anti-colonial
independence movement embraced by Kennedy, himself the president of a
nation that itself had escaped the shackles of colonialism. The Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961 created two accounts, the Development Assistance
(DA) account to be administered by USAID, and the Economic Support Fund
(ESF) to be allocated by the Department of State, for the most part
implemented in the field by USAID missions. The ESF account was intended
to support the foreign policy and security interests of the U.S. The
Development Assistance (DA) account was more focused on need and, while
it reflected the national interest as well, it looked more long term and
at developmental prospects. USAID would be held accountable whichever of
these accounts was being used, but it was often more difficult to
achieve results when partners were selected for purely political
reasons. As economist Robert F. Zimmerman wrote: ESF "has largely failed
to achieve its clearly stated economic and social development goals,
primarily because this assistance has been first and foremost a
diplomatic tool to promote U.S. political and security objectives."
During this period, the United States was instrumental in creating the
Development Assistance Group (DAG), an initiative to coordinate donor
assistance policies and produce accurate and comparable data on official
development assistance (ODA). Soon after, in 1961, the U.S. ratified the
convention creating the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), combining the DAG and the post-Marshall Plan office,
the Organization for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC). The DAG
became the Development Assistance Committee (the DAC), still the only
permanent committee of the OECD, and an important vehicle for U.S.
leadership. President Kennedy provided a strong political rationale for
the aid program by appealing to both our obligations as a rich
country---"our moral obligations as a wise leader and good
neighbor...our obligations as the wealthiest people in a world of
largely poor people..." and also to our security interest "as the single
largest counter to the adversaries of freedom." In September 1961,
Kennedy spoke at the United Nations and called for a "Decade of
Development." The initiative was endorsed by the General Assembly, which
also established concepts of development and global priorities. A decade
later, the United Nations adopted a target for the rich countries of 0.7
percent of GDP for official development assistance (the U.S. and
Switzerland did not accept this commitment). In practical terms, the
challenge then (and now) was how to assure that these resources were
being invested properly and effectively when positive results so
depended on the effectiveness of our partners. These were governments
with weak and often unaccountable institutions, civil societies with
very little appreciation for the requirements of active citizenship,
economies with poorly functioning micro-economic systems (banks, customs
offices, tax systems, and commercial laws), and colonial contexts that
often created ethnic tensions. Many U.S. partners were corrupt
dictatorships, but they opposed communism and thus were beneficiaries of
our aid (usually of the ESF variety). Fears of widespread starvation in
the late 1960s inspired books like The Population Bomb, by Paul Ehrlich,
and provided the impetus to share modern agricultural technology. The
Green Revolution became a model for successful development and Norman
Borlaug received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his contribution. The
Vietnam War saw the USAID budget ramped up and the agency found itself
in the middle of a hot war, working with the military and the Central
Intelligence Agency in an effort to "pacify" villages. The USAID
workforce expanded to some 21,000 employees, the highest number in its
history. Yet this may have been the nadir of the U.S. development
program, as USAID became a tool of the security establishment, calling
into question its reputation as a development partner. Basic human needs
In the 1970s, USAID Administrator John Hannah, reinforced by
presidential study commissions and working closely with Congress,
encouraged the Basic Human Needs initiative, which focused on the
provision of social services to the world's poor. Senator Hubert
Humphrey was the lead proponent of this approach in [the Senate, and
House members]{.underline} Clement Zablocki (D-WI), Donald Fraser
(D-MN), and Brad Morse (R-MA) **[contributed amendments that promoted
community development, democratic governance, and the building of
economic, political and social institutions]{.underline}**. A 1973 House
Foreign Affairs initiative, titled New Directions, called for a focus on
food production, rural development, nutrition, family planning, health,
education, and human resource development. An additional amendment by
Congressman Fraser linked human rights and democratic governance to
development. The fall of the Berlin Wall The collapse of communist
regimes in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in
1989 and 1990 provided a new rationale for the U.S. aid program. The
George H.W. Bush Administration was somewhat slow in responding to this
transition and an aggressive Congress, led by the Senate and House
Committees responsible for foreign affairs, filled the gap with Support
for East European Democracy Act (SEED) in 1989, and The Freedom Support
Act in 1992. Near the end of the George H. W. Bush administration, USAID
was facing mounting challenges as Congress cut its operations budget
just as the demands on its resources were increasing. The transitions in
the former communist world saw the opening of new missions at the same
time that the Congressional coalition of idealists and realists that had
been supportive of foreign aid began to dissipate. The end of the Cold
War was seen as an opportunity for a budgetary "peace dividend" and
USAID, not the Defense Department, was the target. The Agency confronted
allegations that it was poorly managed, had too many ill-defined goals
(some 33 goals and 75 targets) and seemed unresponsive to U.S. foreign
policy needs. When in 1992 Appropriations Committee Chair, Congressman
David Obey, asked Secretary of State James Baker what was wrong, he
replied, "I don't know, Mr. Chairman, I don't know." [The Bush White
House ordered a new study to find the answer.]{.underline} George
Ferris, an old friend of the President, led a bipartisan commission to
investigate. Their final report was highly critical of USAID management
and recommended that USAID be merged into the State Department. The
Clinton years The merger issue consumed considerable attention in both
the Executive Branch and Congress. USAID undertook a number of reforms,
including the creation of the Office of Transitions Initiatives (OTI),
which allowed the Agency to be more responsive to post-conflict
situations. Other reforms included: an effort to focus agency
programming around five developmental and humanitarian relief goals; the
merger of four Washington bureaus into two; and identification of 21
overseas missions for closure based on the quality of the partnership, a
graduation plan, or coverage of smaller countries from a regional base.
A year after these reforms were instituted, George Ferris was quoted
publicly as describing the reforms as a "dramatic transformation" and
announced that he was rescinding his recommendation to merge USAID into
State. Management reforms were not enough. [USAID sought to demonstrate
that other donors shared the goals of peace, prosperity, and democratic
principles.]{.underline} Taking note of USAID's effort to define its
development goals in a strategy paper, USAID joined other donor agencies
to suggest that DAC members write a political paper describing the goals
of the development community. DAC Chair Jim Michel, former career State
Department ambassador and acting administrator of USAID, drafted what
emerged in 1996, after two years of intense negotiation, as "Shaping the
21st Century: The Contribution of Development Co-operation." What
emerged from the paper were eight goals, which were in turn adopted as
part of a G-7 summit statement in 1998 and subsequently by the U.N. in
2001 as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The creation of goals
accelerated the move toward results accountability. USAID had already
moved in this direction, and the adoption of the MDGs and the deadlines
set for achieving the goals (by 2015 in most cases) meant that all
donors had to create data measurement matrices. Development cooperation
was to be held accountable as never before. Now it was time to turn to
effectiveness. The effectiveness era A summit meeting in Monterrey,
Mexico on "Financing for Development" in March 2002 gave new impetus,
not only to the effort to increase ODA, but also to encourage the
mobilization of domestic resources through efficient tax systems, and
more effective use of these resources. President George W. Bush went to
this meeting armed with an announcement that the U.S. would increase
ODA. He eventually would tie his request to a new national security
concept, arguing that defense, diplomacy and development--the 3Ds--were
the three legs of U.S. security policy. With the U.S. taking the lead in
increasing ODA, the DAC organized a series of high-level aid
effectiveness forums. These Forums in Rome, Paris, Accra, and Busan
produced a number of effectiveness principles, calling on donors to
respect local ownership, to harmonize their reporting and auditing
requirements, align their projects, be more transparent, and use country
systems where possible. At the 2011 Fourth Forum in Busan, Korea, the
focus was on convincing South-South (S-S) donors to accept the
principles adopted in the earlier forums. A "Working Party" created by
the DAC engaged several "new providers" of aid including China, Brazil,
and India. A Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation
(GPEDC) was created in Busan with a Steering Committee co-chaired by a
traditional donor, an S-S provider, and a partner country
representative. Subsequent forums in Mexico and Nairobi focused on
implementation of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals adopted in 2015
(see Aspen paper, "U.S. Global Leadership through an SDG Lens," by Homi
Kharas). New goals and a new national security strategy [As the 21st
century moved into its second decade, there was even more convergence
around the security and humanitarian rationales for foreign assistance.
Today, global crises are either emerging or are at risk of unfolding due
to transnational issues such as migration, infectious disease, and
climate-related disasters.]{.underline} [Likewise, ethnic and religious
conflicts exacerbated by extreme poverty can quickly morph into
region-wide conflagrations.]{.underline} Preventing these threats would
require even more investments in development, and, to his credit,
President George W. Bush recognized this, as did his successor, Barack
Obama. Both presidents embraced a national security concept built around
the 3Ds. [International cooperation in development may have reached a
peak at the beginning of the second decade of the 21st
Century.]{.underline} Traditional donors had increased Official
Development Assistance (ODA) by 50 percent since the MDGs were adopted.
A new set of universal goals---the Sustainable Development Goals---was
adopted in 2015. South-South providers were becoming more active led by
China, and triangular projects---with traditional donors, S-S providers,
and partner countries working together---were increasing exponentially.
[Developing countries were contributing more as domestic resource
mobilization systems (tax systems) became more efficient. Foreign Direct
Investment was increasing particularly in middle-income countries. There
was increasing evidence that the effectiveness principles were making an
impact on behavior. While it was no longer the dominant influence, the
United States continued to contribute to this positive trend, leading a
willing international community.]{.underline} Leadership under the
"America First" banner [Was this enough to stem the inexorable surge of
population and poverty? A world population that had increased by 5
billion since the founding of the U.N. and the Bretton Woods
institutions was beginning to overwhelm the international
system.]{.underline} It would take additional resources and new
innovations to stabilize this new and increasingly volatile situation.
For the most part, western democracies were not uniformly generous in
responding. Instead, the immigration flows encouraged by conflict,
criminal gangs, and poverty sparked a nativist, and at times populist,
response. It may be too early to tell whether the "America First"
policies of the Trump administration will stymy efforts to fully
implement a 3D national security strategy. The new administration's
recommended 30 percent cut in diplomacy and development foreign affairs
accounts was rejected by Congress. Momentum for more effective
development assistance---built over two administrations through
initiatives such as the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), legislation to make
food aid more efficient, reforms to AID Forward, the Development
Innovation Laboratory---continue to garner strong bipartisan
congressional support, including through the Trump administration's
USAID transformation program. External support for U.S. aid is strong.
Non-governmental policy and advocacy organizations like the Brookings
Institution, the Modernization of Foreign Assistance Network (MFAN), the
U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC), the Center for Global
Development (CDG), and the Blum Center for Developing Economies at the
University of California, Berkeley, have contributed creative ideas for
invigorating U.S. development. Efforts at reinvigorating U.S.
architecture include: A proposal to merge and strengthen development
finance programs under a new International Development Finance
Corporation (see paper for Session III); the Aid Accountability and
Transparency Act requiring public disclosure of official development
assistance (ODA) in real time; Support for USAID Administrator Mark
Green's plan to merge the Office of U.S. Disaster Assistance and Office
of Food for Peace; Creating a new Bureau for Development, Democracy, and
Innovation, and combining (once again) USAID's policy and budget
functions; Promoting technology innovations, and; Introducing
legislation to reform food aid. The community of nations is under threat
as populist political leaders challenge the international system. [It is
difficult to be optimistic, but so long as there is a vibrant
development community seeking solutions, hope endures that logic will
prevail. Development professionals are by nature patient. They know that
political leaders will turn to them when all else fails.]{.underline}

### Sustainable -- Economy

#### Heg is sustainable -- fiscal capacities and lack of a challenge

**Babones 15** (Salvatore Babones, 6-11-2015, \"American Hegemony Is
Here to Stay,\" National Interest,

IS RETREAT from global hegemony in America's national interest? No idea
has percolated more widely over the past decade---and none is more
bogus[. The United States is not headed for the skids and there is no
reason it should be. The truth is that America can]{.underline} and
should seek to [remain the world's top dog.]{.underline} The idea of
American hegemony is as old as Benjamin Franklin, but has its practical
roots in World War II. The United States emerged from that war as the
dominant economic, political and technological power. The only major
combatant to avoid serious damage to its infrastructure, its housing
stock or its demographic profile, the United States ended the war with
the greatest naval order of battle ever seen in the history of the
world. It became the postwar home of the United Nations, the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. And, of course, the
United States had the bomb. America was, in every sense of the word, a
hegemon. "Hegemony" is a word used by social scientists to describe
leadership within a system of competing states. The Greek historian
Thucydides used the term to characterize the position of Athens in the
Greek world in the middle of the fifth century BC. Athens had the
greatest fleet in the Mediterranean; it was the home of Socrates and
Plato, Sophocles and Aeschylus; it crowned its central Acropolis with
the solid-marble temple to Athena known to history as the Parthenon.
Athens had a powerful rival in Sparta, but no one doubted that Athens
was the hegemon of the time until Sparta defeated it in a bitter
twenty-seven-year war. [America's only global rival in the twentieth
century was the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union never produced more than
about half of America's total national output.]{.underline} Its nominal
allies in Eastern Europe were in fact restive occupied countries, as
were many of its constituent republics. Its client states overseas were
at best partners of convenience, and at worst expensive drains on its
limited resources. [The Soviet Union had the power to resist American
hegemony, but not to displace it.]{.underline} It had the bomb and an
impressive space program, but little else. [When the Soviet Union
finally disintegrated in 1991, American hegemony was
complete.]{.underline} The United States sat at the top of the
international system, facing no serious rivals for global leadership.
This "unipolar moment" lasted a mere decade. September 11, 2001,
signaled the emergence of a new kind of threat to global stability, and
the ensuing rise of China and reemergence of Russia put paid to the era
of unchallenged American leadership. Now, America's internal politics
have deadlocked and the U.S. government shrinks from playing the role of
global policeman. In the second decade of the twenty-first century,
American hegemony is widely perceived to be in terminal decline. Or so
the story goes. In fact, [reports of the passing of U.S. hegemony are
greatly exaggerated. America's costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were
relatively minor affairs considered in long-term
perspective.]{.underline} [The strategic challenge posed by China
has]{.underline} also [been exaggerated]{.underline}. Together with its
inner circle of unshakable English-speaking allies, [the United States
possesses near-total control of the world's seas, skies, airwaves and
cyberspace, while American universities, think tanks and journals
dominate the world of ideas.]{.underline} Put aside all the alarmist
punditry. [American hegemony is now as firm as or firmer than it has
ever been, and will remain so for a long time to come.]{.underline} THE
MASSIVE federal deficit, negative credit-agency reports, repeated
debt-ceiling crises and the 2013 government shutdown all created the
impression that the U.S. government is bankrupt, or close to it. The
U.S. economy imports half a trillion dollars a year more than it
exports. Among the American population, poverty rates are high and
ordinary workers' wages have been stagnant (in real terms) for decades.
Washington seems to be paralyzed by perpetual gridlock. On top of all
this, strategic exhaustion after two costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
has substantially degraded U.S. military capabilities. Then, at the very
moment the military needed to regroup, rebuild and rearm, its budget was
hit by sequestration. [If economic power forms the long-term foundation
for political and military power, it would seem that America is in
terminal decline. But policy analysts tend to have short memories.
Cycles of hegemony run in centuries, not decades]{.underline} (or
seasons). When the United Kingdom finally defeated Napoleon at Waterloo
in 1815, its national resources were completely exhausted. Britain's
public-debt-to-GDP ratio was over 250 percent, and early
nineteenth-century governments lacked access to the full range of fiscal
and financial tools that are available today. Yet the British Century
was only just beginning. The Pax Britannica and the elevation of Queen
Victoria to become empress of India were just around the corner. By
comparison, [America's current public-debt-to- GDP ratio of less than 80
percent is relatively benign.]{.underline} Those with even a limited
historical memory may remember the day in January 2001 when the then
chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, testified to the Senate
Budget Committee that "if current policies remain in place, the total
unified surplus will reach \$800 billion in fiscal year 2011. . . . The
emerging key fiscal policy need is to address the implications of
maintaining surpluses." As the poet said, bliss was it in that dawn to
be alive! Two tax cuts, two wars and one financial crisis later,
America's budget deficit was roughly the size of the projected surplus
that so worried Greenspan. This is not to argue that [the U.S.
government]{.underline} should ramp up taxes and spending, but it does
illustrate the fact that it [has enormous potential fiscal resources
available to it,]{.underline} should it choose to use them. [Deficits
come and go.]{.underline} [America's fiscal capacity in 2015 is
stupendously greater than Great Britain's was in 1815. Financially,
there is every reason to think that America's century lies in the
future, not in the past.]{.underline} The same is true of the supposed
exhaustion of the U.S. military. On the one hand, thirteen years of
continuous warfare have reduced the readiness of many U.S. combat units,
particularly in the army. On the other hand, [U.S. troops are now far
more experienced in actual combat than the forces of any other major
military in the world. In any future conflict, the advantage given by
this experience would likely outweigh any decline in effectiveness due
to deferred maintenance and training]{.underline}. Constant deployment
may place an unpleasant and unfair burden on U.S. service personnel and
their families, but it does not necessarily diminish the capability of
the U.S. military. On the contrary, it may enhance it. [America's
limited wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were hardly the final throes of a
passing hegemon. They are more akin to Britain's bloody but relatively
inconsequential conflicts in Afghanistan and Crimea in the middle of the
nineteenth century. Brutal wars like these repeatedly punctured, but
never burst, British hegemony.]{.underline} In fact, Britain engaged in
costly and sometimes disastrous conflicts throughout the century-long
Pax Britannica. British hegemony did not come to an end until the
country faced Germany head-on in World War I. Even then, Britain
ultimately prevailed (with American help). Its empire reached its
maximum extent not before World War I but immediately after, in 1922.
Ultimately, it is inevitable that in the long run American power will
weaken and American hegemony over the rest of the world will fade. But
how long is the long run? [There are few factual indications that
American decline has begun---or that it will begin anytime soon.
Short-term fluctuations should not be extrapolated into long-term
trends.]{.underline} Without a doubt, 1991 was a moment of supreme U.S.
superiority. But so was 1946, after which came the Soviet bomb, Korea
and Vietnam. American hegemony has waxed and waned over the last seventy
years, but it has never been eclipsed. And it is unlikely that the
eclipse is nigh. WHEN PUNDITS scope out the imminent threats to U.S.
hegemony, the one country on their radar screens is China. While the
former Soviet Union never reached above 45 percent of U.S. total
national income, the Chinese economy may already have overtaken the
American economy, and if not it certainly will soon. If sheer economic
size is the foundation of political and military power, China is
positioned for future global hegemony. Will it build on this foundation?
Can it? Much depends on the future of China's relationships with its
neighbors. China lives in a tough neighborhood. It faces major
middle-tier powers on three sides: Russia to the north, South Korea and
Japan to the east, and Vietnam and India to the south. To the west it
faces a series of weak and failing states, but that may be more of a
burden than a blessing: China's own western regions are also sites of
persistent instability. [It is perhaps realistic to imagine China
seeking to expand to the north at the expense of Russia and
Mongolia]{.underline}. Ethnic Russians are abandoning Siberia and the
Pacific coast in droves, and strategic areas along Russia's border with
China have been demographically and economically overwhelmed by Chinese
immigration. [Twenty-second-century Russia may find it difficult to hold
the Far East against China. But that is not a serious threat to U.S.
hegemony. If anything, increasing Sino-Russian tensions may reinforce
U.S. global hegemony,]{.underline} much as Sino-Soviet tensions did in
the 1970s. To the southeast, China clearly seeks to dominate the South
China Sea and beyond. The main barrier to its doing so is the autonomy
of Taiwan. Were Taiwan ever to be reintegrated with China, it would be
difficult for other regional powers to successfully challenge a united
China for control of the basin. In the future, it is entirely possible
that China will come to dominate these, its own coastal waters. This
would be a minor setback to an America accustomed to dominating all of
the world's seas, but it would not constitute a serious strategic threat
to the United States. Across the East China Sea, China faces Japan and
South Korea---two of the most prosperous, technologically advanced and
militarily best-equipped countries in the world. Historical enmities
ensure that China will never expand in that direction. Worse for China,
it is quite likely that any increase in China's ability to project power
beyond its borders will be matched with similar steps by a wary,
remilitarizing Japan. The countries on China's southern border are so
large, populous and poor that it is difficult to imagine China taking
much interest in the region beyond simple resource exploitation. Chinese
companies may seek profit opportunities in Cambodia, Myanmar and
Pakistan, but there is little for China to gain from strategic
domination of the region. There will be no Chinese-sponsored Asian
equivalent of NATO or the Warsaw Pact. Farther abroad, much has been
made of China's strategic engagement in Africa and Latin America.
Investment-starved countries in these regions have been eager to access
Chinese capital and in many cases have welcomed Chinese investment,
expertise and even immigration. But it is hard to imagine them welcoming
Chinese military bases, and equally hard to imagine China asking them
for bases. The American presence in Africa is in large part the legacy
of centuries of European colonialism. China has no such legacy to build
on. Above all, however, the prospects for future Chinese hegemony depend
on the prospects for future Chinese economic growth. Measured in per
capita terms, China is still poorer than Mexico. That China will catch
up to Mexico seems certain. That China will continue its extraordinary
growth trajectory once it has caught up to Mexico is less obvious. In
2011, when the Chinese economy was growing by more than 10 percent a
year, I predicted that China was headed for much slower growth. At the
time, the IMF was projecting a long-term growth rate of 9.5 percent.
Today, the same IMF projections assume 7 percent growth. Even at 7
percent annual growth, the Chinese economy would account for more than
half of total global output by 2050. The United States in its
post--World War II heyday never achieved that level of dominance. But
exponential extrapolations are inherently tricky. If China continues to
grow at 7 percent while the world economy as a whole grows by 3 percent
per year, China will account for 90 percent of global economic output by
2100 and 100 percent by 2110. After that, China's economy will be even
larger than the world's economy, which of course is impossible unless
China moves a large portion of its production off-planet. A more
reasonable assumption is that China's economic growth will eventually
settle down to global average rates. The only question is when. Existing
demographic trends make it almost certain that the answer is: soon. The
U.S. Census Bureau has projected that China's working-age population
would reach its peak in 2014 and then go into long-term decline. In the
twenty years from 2014 to 2034, China's working-age population will fall
by eighty-seven million, while its elderly population will rise by 149
million. In the language of economic punditry, China will "grow old
before it grows rich." [The U.S. population]{.underline}, by contrast,
[is young and growing. In 2034, the U.S. population is projected to be
growing at a rate of 0.6 percent per year]{.underline} (compared to -0.2
percent in China), [with substantial immigration of talented, productive
people]{.underline} (compared to net emigration from China). The U.S.
median age of 39.2 will be significantly younger than the Chinese median
age of 44.8. Over the long term these trends may change, but the
twenty-year scenario is almost certain, because for the most part it has
already happened. Economic trends can turn on a dime, but demographic
trends are mostly immutable: tomorrow's child-bearers have already been
born. IN THE ancient Mediterranean world, Rome rose to regional hegemony
a century or two after the passing of the Athenian empire. The hegemonic
Roman Republic was a hybrid political entity. It consisted of Rome
itself, Roman colonies, Roman protectorates, cities conquered by Rome
and cities allied to Rome. For four hundred years before 91 BC, the
Italian cities allied to Rome were effectively part of the Roman state
despite their formal political independence. They participated in Rome's
wars under Roman command. They did not pay taxes or tribute to Rome, but
they were fully incorporated into a political system centered on Rome.
When Hannibal crossed the Alps in 218 BC, most of the Italian cities did
not rise up against Rome as he expected. They stood with Rome because
they were effectively part of Rome. In a similar way, [the effective
borders of the American polity extend well beyond the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts.]{.underline} If the Edward Snowden leaks have revealed
nothing else, they have shown the depth of intelligence cooperation
between the United States and its English-speaking allies Australia,
Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. These are the so-called Five
Eyes countries. These English-speaking allies work so closely with the
United States on security issues that they resemble ancient Rome's
Italian allies. Despite their formal political independence, they do not
make major strategic decisions without considering America's interests
as well as their own. Curiously, America's English-speaking allies
resemble the United States in their demographic structures as well.
While East Asia's birthrates have fallen well below replacement levels
and parts of continental Europe face outright depopulation, the
English-speaking countries have stable birthrates and substantial
immigration. The most talented people in the world don't always move to
the United States, but more often than not they move to English-speaking
countries. It doesn't hurt that English is the global lingua franca as
well as the language of the Internet. One surprising result of these
trends is that the once-unfathomable demographic gap between China and
the English-speaking world is narrowing. According to U.S. Census Bureau
projections, in 2050 the U.S. population will be 399 million and rising
by 0.5 percent per year while the Chinese population will be 1.304
billion and falling by 0.5 percent per year. Throw in America's four
English-speaking allies, and the combined five-country population will
be 546 million---nearly 42 percent of China's population---with a growth
rate of 0.4 percent per year. No longer will China have the overwhelming
demographic advantage that has historically let it punch above its
economic weight. Is it reasonable to treat America's English-speaking
allies as integrated components of the U.S. power structure? Of course,
they are not formally integrated into the U.S. state. But the real,
effective borders of countries are much fuzzier than the legal lines
drawn on maps. The United States exercises different levels of influence
over its sovereign territory, extraterritorial possessions, the
English-speaking allies, NATO allies, other treaty allies, nontreaty
allies, client states, spheres of influence, exclusionary zones and even
enemy territories. All of these categories are fluid in their
memberships and meanings, but taken together they constitute more than
just a network of relationships. They constitute a cooperative system of
shared sovereignty, something akin to the power structure of the Roman
Republic. [No other country in the world possesses, has ever possessed,
or is likely to possess in this century such a world-straddling vehicle
for the enforcement of its will.]{.underline} More to the point, the
U.S.-dominated system shows no signs of falling apart. Even the
revelation that America and its English-speaking allies have been spying
on the leaders of their NATO peers has not led to calls for the
dissolution of NATO. [The American system]{.underline} may not last
forever, but its [remaining life may be measured in
centuries]{.underline} rather than decades. [Cycles of hegemony turn
very slowly because systems of hegemony are very robust. The American
power network is much bigger, much stronger and much more resilient than
the formal American state as such.]{.underline}

\"Will Washington abandon world leadership under Trump?\", Foreign
Policy, <http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1051172.shtml> JEJP

[America under the rule of the business tycoon-turned politico has
triggered worldwide concern for globalization and its future and raised
doubts as to whether the most powerful country is seeking to give up
world leadership.]{.underline} What\'s more, there is a view that the
liberal international order is crumbling and Washington\'s retreat is
the beginning of a great transformation. If the rise of Trump is viewed
as a phenomenon, then its main significance lies in shaking the US\'
long-standing political ecology. Trump has mostly focused on domestic
issues in the past five months, and the changes he has brought about to
the country\'s foreign policy are actually less than expected. [By his
own admission, the \"America First\" position means that he puts most of
his energy into addressing domestic affairs. His nature as a businessman
determines the negotiability of foreign affairs. All the arrangements
conducive to achieving his political goals can be compromised and
changed. In this sense, the view that the US will abandon the world
leadership is a **pseudo-proposition**. H]{.underline}ampered by a slew
of conundrums at home, the Trump administration has yet to formulate an
explicit global strategy or more specific Asia-Pacific policy. Its
foreign policy is somewhat fragmented, subject to a severe lack of
coherence and consistency. It has so far been handling diplomatic
episodes quite passively. [Though many of Trump\'s foreign policy
measures are questioned by the international community at large, **it
should not be viewed as an abdication of US hegemony**. Currently
speaking, it would be wrong to draw the conclusion that Trump is
intentional giving up regional and global dominance. Two main pillars of
US hegemony are the **military and financial sectors.** The former is
backed by military power far better than other countries, the strongest
circle of allies, and military bases spanning the globe. The latter is
heavily dependent on dollar hegemony and the US-dominated international
financial system. **Trump has no intention of abandoning** American
military hegemony. Instead, he seeks to boost military spending by 10
percent in the coming fiscal year, further equipping the ground force,
air force and navy with advanced weaponry. In this way, he inherits many
of Obama\'s strategies.]{.underline} In addition, Trump remains
ambiguous toward the financial system under US governance. Given the
domestic landscape, he will prefer trade protectionism and a curtailment
in expenditure of public products. [But **he will never discard US
financial leadership** on the world stage. More importantly, the US
dollar, as a major international currency, is closely related to the
country\'s leadership, and Trump understands this well.]{.underline} To
say the least, [even if he once planned on giving up Washington\'s
global leadership and drawing back to the North American continent, it
seems that he lacks the capacity to do so. The existing international
order features a US hegemony which dates back to the start of WWII and
has since been maintained through the strenuous efforts of generations
of governments. Washington is unlikely to detach itself from the
decades-long, consolidated framework. The conception of \"peace under
American governance\" begun in the US has spread to every corner of the
world]{.underline} to the extent that it is America\'s allies, instead
of the American people, that are most concerned with Trump leading from
the White House. They fear that if Washington breaks its promises on
security, the international order will be plunged into chaos and
conflict. By then they will find themselves mired in gridlock.
Furthermore, [Trump will think twice and be prudent given domestic
obstruction. **Both the Democrats and the Republicans** continue to
support American leadership in the world; they merely differ on policy
and how to best exert leadership.]{.underline}

DTS

Since WWII, the [US grand strategy has focused on pursuing geopolitical
dominance, a unipolar strategy, which has revolved around maintaining
its overwhelming military, economic, and political preponderance through
the promotion of democracy]{.underline} and human rights abroad that is
often touted as national security or foreign policy. With the end of the
Cold War, the US has managed to maintain its great advantage by making
its allies more secure and therefore, keeping its hegemony and the world
order. The [US continues to dominate the international system and thus
discourages advanced industrial nations from challenging its
leadership.]{.underline} Furthermore, the [US has used]{.underline} a
policy of [reassurance to secure US interests]{.underline} and provide
security to key allies [which has prevented them from building their own
military capabilities.]{.underline} Some may argue that this US unipolar
strategy provoked terrorist attacks against the US and its allies, and
it did not prevent the rise of new global powers. Thus, US primacy has
not been entirely successful in guaranteeing its security or economic
and political supremacy. Moreover, [the US has moved far beyond
counterterrorism to counterinsurgency, and from the temporary deployment
of small anti-terrorism forces to a near-permanent military
presence]{.underline}. The American response to terrorism has undermined
critical elements of US 'soft' power in the international arena, even as
its 'hard' power has been reinforced. Notwithstanding its unipolar
status, the terrorist assaults on American and its allies' homeland
demonstrated dramatically that the US faces significant challenges
beyond the realm of great power competition. In terms of security
strategy, **[the Trump administration has clearly drawn away from the
American grand strategic tradition of retrenchment or deep
engagement.]{.underline}** **['America First' seems to have to address
US foreign policy by withdrawing from certain treaties and intervening
in the pursuit of US security and prosperity]{.underline}**. The US
current administration aims to maintain its security and prosperity by
allowing other great powers to promote a global liberal order. [The
Trump administration uses foreign policy more ambitiously because it
considers an unprecedented grand strategy of illiberal
hegemony.]{.underline} Traditional US liberal hegemony strategy used to
focus on promoting democracy and human rights, creating multilateral
institutions, and mirroring the international system vis-à-vis the US
values. In contrast, **[Trump's illiberal hegemony strategy seeks
superior economic and military capability by portraying the US as the
world's arbiter]{.underline}**. Such an expensive strategy has increased
the US defense budget, security and military commitments, **[and nuclear
modernization programs]{.underline}**. Contrary to previous
administrations that invested considerable sums of money in building
democracy abroad[, the Trump administration envisions engagement with
the world's security problems by targeting its main allies -- Europe,
Japan, and Saudi Arabia. Trump's foreign policy in Europe intensified EU
efforts to reduce an over-reliance on US protection]{.underline}. It
seems that the US administration is trying to return NATO to Europe [by
mitigating its financial contribution and military spending for a NATO
expansion.]{.underline} As a result, the EU launched a military
joint-force, PESCO, that could pave the way for an EU army.

There is a schizophrenia at the heart of debates about U.S. hegemony. On
the one hand, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [has made it easy
for critics to argue that America has ended.]{.underline} [Long-term
trends show that China is catching up to the United States]{.underline}
on just about every conceivable capability metric. [Short-term trends
show the European Union is a more potent regulatory power]{.underline}
and the United States has become more isolated on questions of, say,
aviation regulation. At the same time, [serious international relations
scholars have argued that U.S. hegemonic power has
persisted]{.underline}. Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth made the
case a few years ago that the United States remained the preeminent
power in the world. My Tufts University colleague Michael Beckley made a
similar argument last year. Andrea and Mauro Gilli have further argued
that China will be unable to catch up in technological sophistication to
the U.S. military. [The latest addition]{.underline} to the latter genre
comes from Adam Tooze in the London Review of Books. Tooze [does not
dispute the low caliber of current American foreign policy.]{.underline}
[Rather, he asks whether it matters in the grand scheme of
things]{.underline}. On the military front, for example, Tooze writes:
[Never before]{.underline} in history [has military power been as skewed
as it is today]{.underline}. For better or worse, [it is America's
preponderance that shapes whatever we call the international
order]{.underline}. And given how freely that power has been used, to
call it a Pax Americana seems inapposite. A generation of American
soldiers has grown used to fighting wars on totally asymmetrical terms.
That for them is what the American world order means. [Tooze makes
similar points on the economic side]{.underline} of the power equation:
"[**The hegemony of the dollar-Treasury nexus in global finance remains
unchallenged**. The dollar's role in global finance didn't just
survive]{.underline} the crisis of [2008]{.underline}: [it was
reinforced by it.]{.underline} As the world's banks gasped for dollar
liquidity, [the Federal Reserve transformed itself into a global lender
of last resort."]{.underline} Tooze's conclusion is that "**[two years
into the Trump presidency, it is a gross exaggeration to talk of an end
to the American world order]{.underline}**. **[The two pillars of its
global power --- military and financial --- are still firmly in
place]{.underline}.** What has ended is any claim on the part of
American democracy to provide a political model." Is Tooze correct? He
does hit upon the central paradox of the current state of world
politics. [Not even the incompetence of]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [can necessarily dent U.S. structural
power]{.underline} (though I am more worried about the dollar than
Tooze). The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has noted
repeatedly that [the Trump administration]{.underline} has accomplished
next to nothing in rewriting the deals that make the world go round. Its
[strategy of antagonizing allies at the same time that it antagonizes
adversaries has been self-defeating]{.underline}. America's soft power
has been temporarily eviscerated. **[Despite all this]{.underline}**,
however**[, U.S. military and economic capabilities remain pretty
formidable]{.underline}**. **[The United States is at the center
of]{.underline}** most of the key networks that drive **[world politics
and the global economy]{.underline}**.

mentioned]{.underline}](http://www.china.com.cn/news/2015-10/19/content_36838756.htm)
[that China "is not willing to become the so-called 'world police', nor
to replace anyone."]{.underline} This can be taken to mean that [**China
does not have the desire to replace the United States' global
role**.]{.underline} Some may argue, however, that a country's desires
are volatile, and that capacity matters more -- meaning that China will
change its desires when its capacity rises. Is China's capacity likely
to exceed that of the United States, then? One country's capacity could
be divided into "hard power" and "soft power." [**Hard power,
particularly economic capacity and military strength, is the foundation
of the United States' global leading** role after World War
II.]{.underline} But a combination of hard and soft power is the
necessary and sufficient condition for a global leader's rise. [The soft
power of the United States is mainly embodied in the construction and
leadership of the postwar international system, its cultural attributes,
the development of science and technology and higher education, and the
relatively loose immigration policy. At the end of WWII, the United
States accounted for 60 percent of the global GDP and its industrial
production capacity was half of that of the world.]{.underline} Its oil
and steel production accounted for 70 percent and 64 percent of the
world total, respectively, and the United States held 73.4 percent of
the gold reserves of the entire capitalist world at the time. [With this
hard power as the base, in addition to the United States' advanced
production capacity and technological development, U.S. military
strength at the end of the WWII surpassed that of the other victorious
Allied powers. Thanks to these advantages, the United States has
continuously been the world's largest economy]{.underline} since WWII,
[and built a global alliance system and a network of global military
bases at the same time.]{.underline} Unlike Great Britain, France, and
other countries that exerted international influence through colonies,
[the United States preferred to govern the world by establishing a
series of international systems: the United Nations and its affiliates
for the political and security arena; the alliance system and military
base network in the military arena; the Bretton Woods system for
finance, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, which
later evolved into the WTO) for trade.]{.underline} The United States
already ranked first in the world in terms of industrial output in 1894.
However, it was not until after World War II that it surpassed European
countries in terms of technology and higher education. [Given the rapid
development of the United States in the humanities and social sciences,
as well as the influx of European intellectuals during WWII, the United
States, by this stage, had replaced the European countries as the global
center for scientific research and higher education, thereby attracted
talents from all over the world.]{.underline} The United States'
relatively loose immigration policy also promoted this trend. [**As a
result of gathering global talents, the United States gained an
unrivalled capacity for innovation and became a universal home for
capable peoples** from different countries and
civilizations]{.underline}. [After WWII, the United States consequently
contributed more than 50 percent of the Nobel Prize
winners]{.underline}. [This talent influx also boosted the U.S. global
leadership role. **The United States will keep its advantage in
attracting high quality immigrants in the foreseeable
future**.]{.underline} WWII provided the United States an exceptional
opportunity to become a world leader. Reconstructing the world order
through war is hard to imagine in the era of nuclear weapons. Given that
a peaceful rise is the only realistic choice for China at present,
[China can only surpass the United States in some specific
aspects]{.underline} such as GDP, national defense expenditures, the
number of international students, and so on. [In terms of the number of
allies, global military bases, influence on the United Nations and its
affiliates, influence on the global finance sector and so forth, it is
very difficult for China to rival the United States.]{.underline} In
addition, cross-civilization governance costs dearly. While U.S. soft
power was helped by a global familiarity with European cultural
elements, as spread during colonialism, [Chinese culture is a typical
regional civilization -- this significantly raises the cost of China's
global governance and limits China's global appeal. Further, considering
that it is difficult for China to attract global talents like the United
States and become a new home for immigrants, China is highly unlikely to
outperform the United States in higher education, scientific research,
and innovation.]{.underline} In the process of its rise, [China is
likely to concentrate on building its own order or system]{.underline}.
However, [this will be largely limited to regional
influence,]{.underline} and mainly reflected in nonmilitary aspects.
China can be expected to establish international mechanisms confined to
certain areas (such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank), but
again, [creating dominant international organizations like the United
Nations will be impossible for China.]{.underline} All in all, [China is
unlikely to replace the United States' global role after its
rise.]{.underline}

**China won't surpass -- economic, military, and cultural domination
prove**

**Pass 4/12** (Jonathan Pass, Lecturer at the School of Public
International Law and International Relations at the Universidad Pablo
de Olavide, 04-12-2019, \"Jonathan Pass: \'It\'s too soon to talk about
the end of American hegemony\',\" EurekAlert!,
https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-04/updo-jp041219.php)

[\"For now, I would say that it is still too soon to talk about the end
of American hegemony: global structural changes occur slowly and often
in contradictory forms\",]{.underline} Dr. Pass affirms, citing as an
example how, [after the 2008 financial crisis, investors fled to the
dollar and US Treasury bonds.]{.underline} \"[Until China carries out
the complete internationalisation of the renminbi, current account
liberalization, and opens up its internal market to foreign
investors]{.underline} - [measures with]{.underline} potentially
important [domestic]{.underline} political [repercussions - it is likely
that the United States will continue to enjoy this privileged
position\"]{.underline}, he adds. One of work\'s principal merits is the
elaboration of a novel theoretical framework, which has also been
published in the article \"Gramsci Meets Emergent Materialism: Towards a
Neo Neo-Gramscian Perspective on World Order\" in the journal Review of
International Studies (Cambridge University Press). The author carries
out a critique of the neo-Gramscian perspective, offering a
sophisticated, explicitly materialist, theory on world hegemony rooted
in critical realism. \"[In international relations\", he explains,
\"there is a tendency to conceptualise hegemony as being synonymous with
either \'domination\']{.underline} (based on coercion[) or
\'intellectual and moral leadership\']{.underline} (a consensual and
intersubjective relationship), [when in reality both elements are always
present\".]{.underline} With regards its main theme, \'American Hegemony
in the 21st Century: a Neo neo-Gramscian Perspective\' focuses on
American hegemony, exploring the origins and construction process of
this \'leadership\', in addition to its shifts and transformations
during periods of crisis. Jonathan Pass emphasizes that [the causes of
American hegemony\'s present crisis can be found in the internal
contradictions of the neoliberal/financialization accumulation regime
and the conservative revolution that United States \'exported\' from the
mid-1970s onwards. Nevertheless, and although its hegemony might be
weakening, the author makes clear that the US still maintains its
dominance in key economic sectors]{.underline} (e.g. finance, IT and
retail) [and industries]{.underline} (e.g. aerospace, pharmaceuticals
and arms). Likewise, [he stresses that both cultural and military
hegemony are in good health:]{.underline} [\"For now, nobody questions
US supremacy in the audiovisual sector, advertising/marketing and the
arts.]{.underline} [Nobody doubts]{.underline} it boasts the most
influential media, social networks and elite universities in the world,
or that [its military forces far exceed any rival with regards the
sophistication and might of its weaponry and global power
projection\".]{.underline} Pass maintains that we are living through
what Gramsci called \'interregnum\': a crisis created when the old order
is dying but the new one has yet to be born. \"When the capitalist
system enters a crisis, it is usually those \'at the bottom\' who end up
paying the consequences. Unsurprisingly the lower classes seek solutions
outside the \'mainstream\'. Given the weakness of the Left, predictably
it is right-wing popularism such as that of Trump, UKIP or Vox, that end
up attracting followers\", he asserts. In the book, the researcher
describes the rise of China as an \"historical event\" producing a
restructuring of the global capitalist system and affecting power
relations both between and within states. To evaluate China\'s \'world
hegemon\' potential, the author dedicates chapter 5 to analysing its
evolution over the last 40 years. \"It has been undergoing what Gramsci
termed a \'passive revolution\': a socio-economic transformation
directed from above. During almost all this time it has remained
faithful to Deng Xiaoping\'s maxim \'hide our capabilities and bide our
time\' with respects to the world order\", Dr. Pass claims, adding that
things started to change for China following the 2008 financial crisis,
which made it clear just how unsustainable its economic growth model and
neoliberal/financialization accumulation regime were. \"Since then,
Beijing has been much more proactive in the global economy, supporting
the international expansion of its corporations, setting up its own
multilateral institutions, away from of the Bretton Woods \'trio\', and
launching its own particular Marshall Plan across Eurasia (Belt and Road
Initiative). Said measures, needless to say, have not gone down well
with Washington\", he holds. Finally, one of the key arguments of the
book is that [world hegemony depends upon the \'internationalization\'
of the social forces emergent from the dynamics of its national class
system. The]{.underline} author explains that the [big challenge for Xi
Jinping is how to reconcile the official, nominally communist, political
regime with the socio-economic reality:]{.underline} a ferociously
capitalist country with exorbitant levels of economic and regional
inequality. Concerning the outlook for the coming years, Pass errs on
the side of caution: \"It\'s difficult to make predictions about the
future. One has to remember that hegemony is not a \'state\', but rather
a \'process\'. Historically, [hegemonic transitions are long, complex
and bellicose. Much will depend on how the huge contradictions inside
China play out]{.underline}, especially the dynamic of its \'passive
revolution\'.

Sustaining a hegemonic order is expensive, and the domestic and
international politics of any such order will hinge on its net benefits
to key actors, particularly the hegemon itself. [When does hegemony pay?
As G. John Ikenberry and Daniel H. Nexon note, this is a critical
question in the study of hegemonic orders]{.underline}. [3 We show that
Rousseau and Carr pointed to the answer: the relationship between
military power, political order, and economic plenty]{.underline}.
Notwithstanding major research traditions dealing with this
relationship, international relations scholarship remains poorly
equipped to grapple with it. In addressing this gap, we show how
[**hegemonic states in different international systems can use military
power to structure beneficial orders**, and how those orders, in turn,
can shape the hegemon's capabilities]{.underline}. The current bout of
"declinist" angst about whether the United States can and should sustain
its hegemonic position is but the latest in a long series of
hand-wringing running back seven decades. The first phase, in the 1950s,
was primarily about the technological, economic, and ideological
competitiveness of the United States vis-à-vis what was thought to be a
fastrising Soviet challenger. The second, in the 1970s, combined
geopolitical setbacks (fall of Saigon, Soviet nuclear parity) with
economic challenges (end of Bretton Woods). The third combined concern
about the rising deficits of the early to mid-1980s and slowing growth
with apprehension about the rising security costs of containing the
Soviet Union. The current episode again melds geopolitical challenges
(rising costs of sustaining US positions in Asia, the Middle East, and
Europe) with economic ones (2008 financial crisis, slower growth, trade
and budget deficits, declining domestic working class, and public
infrastructure). 3 G. John Ikenberry and Daniel H. Nexon, "Hegmony
Studies 3.0: The Dynamics of Hegemonic Orders," Security Studies 28, no.
3 (July--September 2019) The decline scares spanning the 1970s and 1980s
helped to propel a major wave of scholarship on hegemonic order. As we
show below, however, [scholarship focused on the security and economic
dimensions of hegemony generally developed separately and often did not
cohere, impeding scholars' ability to assess the scale of decline
challenges]{.underline}. [After all, each previous wave of declinism
seems to have been overblown, and each ended with the United States'
position sustained and sometimes strengthened]{.underline}. While there
are many reasons for past failures to anticipate the resilience of US
leadership, we show that part of the problem is misspecifying this core
security--economics interaction. We advance an argument that extends
raison d'état logic to a logic of raison de l'hégémonie[. The epigrams
above from Carr and Rousseau capture the two key threads that wind
through hegemonic-order studies but have yet to be sewn into a
cost-benefit framework that encompasses the American experience and
situates it in historical patterns. First, as Carr stressed, production
requires protection: economic exchange depends on political
order.]{.underline} Yet the vast preponderance of writing on hegemonic
order posits a trade-off relation in which resources devoted to
protection are diverted from productive activity, and the costs of
organizing a capacity for violence increase with the scale of
protection, threatening economic well-being. The dilemmas presented by
this trade-off between protection and production are central to
foundational mid-twentieth-century scholarship on hegemony and hegemonic
stability, notably Robert Gilpin's War and Change in World Politics.4
[Rousseau stresses a second, less often noted, and still poorly
theorized thread: the potential complementarity between protection and
production. Under certain circumstances, the costs of providing
protection internationally **complement a hegemonic actor's**
productive]{.underline} 4 Robert Gilpin, War and Change in Global
Politics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981).
[activity]{.underline}. We take this complementarity for granted in
domestic settings where order provision is contingent on violence
capacity and is the dominant strategy for a ruler or prince. [Here, we
simply extend this logic to the leading state in a formally anarchic
system. The argument is familiar in discussions of the emergence of
states, less so in scholarship on the costs and benefits of hegemony. It
applies in three stages corresponding roughly to the complexity of
political order: Stage 1: Domestic order and the emergence of states.
**A state with a monopoly on legitimate collective violence capacity
solves the anarchy problem and allows for institutions that enable
riskier economic activities with a long-term time horizon**. Stage 2:
Defense from external predators. Military capabilities protect actors on
a given territory from external predation. Stage 3: International
extension of the domestic-order logic of stages 1 and 2]{.underline}.
The first two stages are well understood in the literature. The third
less so. It extends the logics of stages 1 and 2 to some or all states
by protecting them from external predation and by attenuating
anarchy-driven security dilemmas. [If protection can complement
production within a state, it follows that protection and production may
also shift from trade-off to complementarity externally]{.underline}. In
the sections that follow, we show how [complementarity between
protection and production depends on key underlying relationships that
vary through time, illustrating each with reference to the ways in which
previous hegemonic-order studies missed these key relationships or how
they vary.]{.underline} In the first section we address the most basic
military-economic interactions: [do military powers have to be
productive to be strong, and do productive economies have to be
militarily strong to be wealthy?]{.underline} The second section
addresses a more complex set of interactions between security and
economics: [how sensitive is state security to economic openness, and
how sensitive is the international economy to insecurity?]{.underline}
The third section examines another crucial interaction between military
power and economic plenty: how social relationships growing out of
security networks centered around massive military power can, under some
circumstances, complement economic power in ways that lower its
leadership costs and raise benefits. [These propositions provide
a]{.underline} theoretical [framework for understanding the costs and
benefits of hegemony with an emphasis on the conditions that affect
potential complementarity between military protection and economic
production.]{.underline} [The theory situates the post--World War II
United States as a particular case of a hegemon and helps reconcile the
US experience with large scholarly literatures in political science,
historical sociology, and economics that capture only aspects of the US
case.]{.underline} In the fourth section, we zero in on the current
debate, extracting from the theory a set of core questions to answer in
order to determine whether "this time, it's for real." 5

### AT: Trump

#### Global data shows most countries positively view US hegemony despite Trump

**Olsen 19**. Henry Olsen is a Washington Post columnist and a senior

\["The world doesn't hate Trump's America as much as people think," July
9, *Washington Post*, URL:

[Common wisdom]{.underline} seems to [tell us that the United States has
suffered under President Trump]{.underline} in terms of its image and
influence around the world. **[Recent data, however, suggests there's
less to that charge than people might think.]{.underline}** I recently
attended the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, convened by former Danish
prime minister and NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen's
foundation, which brought together leaders and democracy activists from
across the globe. Participants explored topics such as how activists in
Syria, Myanmar and Nigeria are bringing democratic practices and values
to their countries and the role that private-sector entrepreneurship in
places such as Iraq can expand economic growth and civil society. But
[the burning issues on everyone's mind --- Trump, populism, and the
state of democracy in the West --- were fully addressed,
too]{.underline}. Rasmussen's opening remarks set the tone: "[Democracy
is in crisis]{.underline}," he contended. [The reasons: "Western
self-doubt" and an unwillingness of Western political leaders to take "a
good look in the mirror]{.underline}." The United States was not spared
from this critique. "**[For our democracies to survive," he said, "we
need American leadership. Today, the world is on fire because the U.S.
decided to stop being the world's fireman."]{.underline}** House
Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) argued at the event that there
was still bipartisan congressional commitment to the postwar global
structure. He voiced strong support for democratic values and movements,
specifically calling out Turkey, Hungary and the Philippines as
countries moving in the wrong direction. House Intelligence Committee
Chair Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) concurred but argued that this consensus
"was not always reflected in the White House." Overall, [the gist of the
summit seemed to follow the standard story that Trump's election has
upset the previously placid democratic apple cart --- though
participants such as Schiff acknowledged that "the fire began before
Trump,"]{.underline} **[noting that globalization, social media
manipulation, economic anxiety and populism were rising before his
election.]{.underline}** Rasmussen, for his part, told me that the
United States stopped being the world's fireman during the Obama
administration, most acutely when the president decided not to enforce
the "red line" in Syria. Polling data presented by Dalia Research
confirms the negative views many Europeans hold toward the United States
today. The company polled more than 177,000 people in 54 countries this
spring. It asked, among other questions, whether the United States was a
positive or negative force for democracy in the world. [The opinion was
decidedly negative in much of western Europe, Canada and Australia.
Margins ranged from minus-47 in Austria and minus-40 in Germany to
"only" minus-32 in Canada and minus-16 in France and minus-15 in
Australia.]{.underline} People in many of our strongest allies are
clearly upset with U.S. leadership in the Trump era. But that's far from
the whole story. [Similarly large and negative margins arose elsewhere
only in countries such as Russia and Turkey that Trump has sharply
criticized]{.underline}. **[Almost all of the rest of the world still
sees the United States as a net positive force for democracy --- in many
cases, strongly so. Asia is an excellent example]{.underline}**. People
in every country surveyed except China and Malaysia viewed U.S.
influence positively. [Residents of the Philippines, Vietnam, India,
South Korea and Taiwan gave extremely positive scores to U.S. influence,
while positives outweighed negatives in Japan by nine
points]{.underline}. The Trump administration's confrontational stances
toward China and North Korea seem to have produced a much different
reaction in the nations close to the danger than in places much farther
away. This pattern --- [the enemy of my enemy is my friend --- was
repeated everywhere else in the world. Every South American country
included in the poll except Argentina thought the United States was a
force for democratic good]{.underline}, with the highest margin in
Venezuela. **[Trump unites the Middle East with his anti-Iranian
campaign, as Israelis, Saudis, Egyptians and even Iranians agree the
United States is good for democracy;]{.underline}** so, too, do the few
African countries included in the poll. The more data one examines, the
more it appears that **[Western Europe is the outlier, not the United
States]{.underline}**. That message comes through plainly when one looks
at European governments with populist governments or which have Russian
troops nearby. U.S. influence is viewed extremely positively by Poles
(plus-36 percent) and Ukrainians (plus-30 percent). [The United States
is also viewed positively in Romania, Hungary, Italy and
Portugal]{.underline}. Again, this neatly mirrors the split within the
European Union between populist, eastern nations and the more developed,
western ones. Trump has clearly disrupted traditional U.S. foreign
policy --- and not always in a good direction. But for all the
complaining, **[the data presented at the conference shows that the
United States continues to be well regarded in many places around the
globe.]{.underline}** Maybe that's something Western leaders should
consider if they follow Rasmussen's advice and start looking in the
mirror.

[Donald Trump has in just over two years abandoned the]{.underline}
Trans-Pacific Partnership [(TPP), ditched the]{.underline} Transatlantic
Trade and Investment Partnership [(TTIP),]{.underline} [withdrawn the US
from the Paris climate agreement, and unilaterally removed American
participation in]{.underline} the Iranian nuclear agreement known as the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action [(JCPOA).]{.underline} Some of these
decisions have undoubtedly received popular support from far beyond
America's shores. Washington\'s withdrawal from the TPP was welcomed by
the People\'s Republic of China. During the Obama presidency, Xi Jinping
strongly protested the exclusion of Beijing from the TPP. In the case of
the TTIP, European allies for the most part were strongly opposed to the
treaty because European multinationals would be subjected to sanctions
and fines from American authorities. The climate agreement, placing
important limits on CO2 emissions as well as imposing regulations
governing pollution, has been strongly resisted by US energy oligarchs.
The withdrawal from the Paris accord has satisfied a substantial
proportion of Trump\'s donors linked to the hydrocarbon industry and
beyond. Finally, the abandonment of the JCPOA was praised by Riyadh and
Tel Aviv, two essential partners in Trump\'s domestic and foreign
strategies. Observing the consequences of these political choices in the
months since, it is easy to see how [the world has]{.underline} reacted
in a more or less similar fashion, which has been by [ignoring the
United States and emphasizing cooperation amongst themselves. The
TPP]{.underline}, with its agreements between 11 countries, [has
remained in place without Washington. The development of relations
between ASEAN and China continues on without Washingto]{.underline}n's
participation. While the TTIP has been halted, [the Comprehensive
Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), is in its final approval stage, an
agreement between Canada and the EU that bypasses the American-inspired
TTIP]{.underline}. The Iran deal remains in force despite Washington\'s
cowardly withdrawal, and the five countries remaining in the Iranian
nuclear agreement have every intention of respecting the JCPOA, which
had been negotiated over a number of years. In addition to withdrawing
from the above treaties, [Washington has started a serious trade war and
is imposing tariffs on allies and enemies alike. From Russia to the EU,
as well as China, South Korea, Japan and Turkey, everyone is facing the
unprecedented decision to apply tariffs on trade.]{.underline} In
Trump\'s mind, this is the only way to balance a trade deficit that has
now reached more than 500 billion dollars. In addition to the dismantled
treaties and imposition of tariffs, [Trump strongly criticized some
pillars of the post-World War II liberal order, such as NATO and
America's European allies themselves.]{.underline} The suggestion that
NATO may be obsolete has shaken the European capitals to their core,
even as the Russian Federation may see it as signalling the prospect of
positive relations with the United States. [Later it was understood that
Trump\'s strategy was to present himself before his electors with
tangible achievements, in this case a substantial increase in military
spending by NATO countries in Europe]{.underline}. Trump wants a
commitment of 2% of GDP to be spent on defense, and **[NATO's leaders
are now agreeing on the need to invest more money.]{.underline}**

[Trump has]{.underline} now [lost the trust of world leaders and become
a "net exporter of instability,]{.underline}" she added. [Trump "is so
fearful of being ridiculed]{.underline}. [He constantly talks about the
fact that we were the laughing stock,"]{.underline} McEldowney
continued. "He doesn't understand that the world is laughing at him
now." "Trump does see himself as an unconventional statesmen, and he
makes no apologies for that." Former Secretary of State John Kerry told
the NewsHour's Judy Woodruff earlier this month that [Trump's fear and
his unfamiliarity with the world can lead to other
problems.]{.underline} "There are certain people who are readily and
happily taking advantage of this president," Kerry said. "And you have
seen that, I think, with what China is doing right now in certain
places. You see that with President Putin in so many ways." Other
foreign policy watchers said the focus should be on the big picture
instead of individual instances where Trump might have ruffled some
feathers. "[Trump does see himself as an unconventional
statesmen]{.underline}, [and he makes no apologies for
that,]{.underline}" said James Carafano, a vice president at the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. [Trump backers point to
the summit]{.underline} in Singapore [between the president and Kim Jong
Un as an example of an effective use of soft power]{.underline}. Obama
did not go so far as to meet with Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, who was in
power at the time, although he did say he would meet with foreign
leaders without preconditions and was criticized for it. Kerry said he
supported Trump's efforts to reach out to Kim Jong Un but did not
support "diplomacy that has not been thought through sufficiently." [The
diplomatic effort in North Korea included Trump's own unique take on
U.S. soft powe]{.underline}r. Trump's team presented Kim with a
Hollywood blockbuster trailer-style video that mapped out a possible
future for North Korea, filled with U.S. cultural references like
professional basketball games, high-tech manufacturing, and and
large-scale public works construction projects. [After the Singapore
summit,]{.underline} Trump said [North Korea had agreed to
denuclearization]{.underline}, even though no formal agreement was made.
National Security Adviser John Bolton told PBS NewsHour last month that
North Korea has not taken effective steps to denuclearize. But in a
joint statement with South Korea on Wednesday, North Korea announced it
was prepared to dismantle a main nuclear complex if the U.S. took
corresponding measures. Pletka, with the American Enterprise Institute,
said **[once you get past the rhetoric, Trump administration officials
are, for the most part, acting in line with their
predecessors]{.underline}**. "One can, as many on the left and many on
the right do as well, focus on the things that Donald Trump says, but
most of those things don't translate into policy," Pletka said. "I think
governments recognize that there is a disconnect between the rhetoric
and the policies, and \[they\] act accordingly." Carafano countered that
[even when Trump is criticizing his allies, like he did at the NATO
summit in July, he is exerting soft power]{.underline}. "[Soft power is
not all pleasurable]{.underline}," he said. Does a strong economy create
soft power? A nation's economic might does not fall neatly in any one
category. As Nye wrote in Foreign Policy, "You can coerce countries with
sanctions or woo them with wealth." Either way, [the U.S. still has the
world's largest economy --- something that cannot be
ignored]{.underline}. [Since Trump took office, the unemployment rate
has fallen below 4 percent, stocks have continued to climb, and
blue-collar jobs are growing more quickly than they have in 30
years.]{.underline} Gross domestic product ticked up to 2.3 percent in
2017 after dropping to a paltry 1.5 percent in 2016. Economists debate
how much Trump's policies have influenced the economy, but [the
president regularly takes credit for the gains]{.underline}. At a recent
White House press briefing, Kevin Hassett, the chair of the Council of
Economic Advisers, argued that the Obama administration should not get
all the credit for the economic growth seen in recent months. "I can
promise you that [economic historians will 100 percent accept the fact
that there was an inflection at the election of Donald
Trump]{.underline}," Hassett said. Demonstrators in London protest

foreign policy.]{.underline} Administration officials say "let's fix the
economy. Let's have strong defense. Then, how do we layer the soft power
over those to make them the most effective?" Carafano said. The question
is whether the president's tariffs and broader trade policies will hurt
economic interests at home and abroad. "Establishing sales relationships
where a farmer in the United States can grow soybeans and sell them to
China, these take years to set up, years to grow, and they can be
destroyed overnight," McEldowney said. Other sources of soft power The
debate over soft power won't end anytime soon. But many foreign policy
experts seem to agree on at least one thing: [the president does not
solely determine how much soft power the U.S. has or how the country
uses it. "American soft power is]{.underline} generated not just by the
government," Nye said. "It's [also generated by the nature of our
society."]{.underline} "There are large parts of the world that crave
American leadership." Polling from the Soft Power 30 index did show a
substantial drop in favorability toward the United States after Trump
came into office. But universities, Hollywood and nonprofit
organizations also affect how people abroad view the United States, and
public opinion can have a large influence on how their leaders deal or
don't deal with the U.S. Plus, foreign policy experts emphasize, [the
United States' reputation has been built over centuries and is not
determined by any one administration]{.underline}. "I believe there are
large parts of the world that crave American leadership, that want the
responsible and benign exercise of American power to effect good in the
world," McEldowney said.

Promotion, Sell Trumpism to the World," *the National Interest*,

[Donald Trump doesn't believe in regime change or nation-building. He is
skeptical of international organizations and institutions. He frets over
allies that aren't pulling their weight. **But Trump is no isolationist,
and he's shown no interest in "leading from behind."**]{.underline} So
what does Trump believe in? His catchphrase, "[America First," suggests
that the president views his job as protecting the vital interests of
America]{.underline}. But the slogan itself doesn't have much
explanatory value. Moreover, his large public persona, hyperbolic
rhetoric and free-wheeling tweets often cloud an understanding of
administration policy. [**This leaves the administration open to equally
outlandish criticisms, with charges ranging from coddling dictators to
ignoring human rights.** But tweets are not policy. The president's
policies have been neither mercurial nor unreasonable]{.underline}.
Trump does, however, need to do a better job selling Trumpism around the
world. The 2017 National Security Strategy offers a clear blueprint of
Trump's foreign policy. As my colleague Nile Gardiner summarized: "It
takes a clear-cut view of the immense challenges faced by the United
States from an array of actors, from Russia, China, and North Korea to
transnational, largely Islamist terror networks. In addition, [the
strategy emphatically rules out the idea of extending the hand of
friendship to rogue regimes such as Iran."]{.underline} The document
reveals [a president committed to pursuing a "peace through strength"
military and leaning forward in critical parts of the world where
America's vital interests are under assault.]{.underline} For two years
now **[the administration has largely followed the game plan: improving
military readiness; crushing the Caliphate; stiff-arming Iran;
reinforcing the U.S. presence in Europe; pushing back on Putin;
challenging China and attempting to tame Kim's nuclear
program.]{.underline}** Even the president's recent pronouncements on
the way forward in [Syria and Afghanistan are not necessarily a reversal
of his stated course; they may just portend an adjustment to the
American footprint to accommodate a long-term U.S. presence
there]{.underline}. But the administration must size the footprint
correctly; American cannot afford to repeat the kind of mistake Obama
made in withdrawing from Iraq. Running Out of Gas? Executing the
National Security Strategy requires more than adjusting military
deployments, however. Trump faces a combative House of Representatives,
confused allies overseas, and foreign competitors who may try to just
wait out the Trump presidency. To keep on track, [the White House will
need to make better use of the nonmilitary instruments of national power
its disposal. To date, the administration has undervalued some of these
tools.]{.underline} In his resignation letter, Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis rightly observed that the administration has done a poor job
explaining U.S. policies to both friends and enemies. **[The president
can be an unconventional statesmen if he wishes, but that does not
absolve him of his responsibility to ensure the world clearly
understands his policies.]{.underline}** To date, [Trump]{.underline}
has made only a handful of big speeches on foreign and national security
policy. His August 2017 [speech in Warsaw was quite impressive, as was
his address on Afghanistan policy, delivered that same month. Trump
should do more of these.]{.underline} The administration's public
diplomacy efforts have been broadly lacking, as well. The White House
has shown little sense of urgency about putting its imprint on this
mission. [Most of the key appointive positions remain vacant or occupied
by Obama holdovers.]{.underline} This is not entirely Trump's fault.
Helle Dale observes that "[without fail, every time a Trump nominee gets
closer to a Senate confirmation hearing to head the International
Broadcasting Bureau, the media pounces and sounds the
alarm]{.underline}." But it is problematic that, for the most part, the
White House seems content to do little about it. This is not to say that
Team Trump has touched none of the levers of power beyond troops,
tariffs and sanctions. For example, [National Security Advisor John
Bolton recently laid out an Africa strategy that seeks to make better
use of the instruments of engagement, influence and investment. The
administration also championed passage of the Build Act, which will
"facilitate the participation of private sector capital and skills in
the economic development of countries with low- or lower-middle-income
economies."]{.underline} But the administration still underperforms in
selling Trump's self-help brand of empowerment to America's friends,
allies and strategic partners. **[Though uninterested in democracy
promotion, nation-building or regime-change, Trump wants to see our
partners become freer, stronger, more prosperous, and more
self-confident partners. He can do to speed up that outcome to America's
benefit.]{.underline}** The Art of the Sale To keep the National
Security Strategy on track, the administration will need to build
bipartisan congressional support for U.S. institutions working
constructively overseas. It will also need to help build the
capabilities, expertise, and capacity of effective nongovernmental
organizations and foreign agencies. This will require a subordinate
strategy to harness these institutions in support of the National
Security Strategy---like a matryoshka doll that fits neatly inside a
larger one. As with any good strategy, this will require making hard
choices and tackling big problems to drive significant change in
organizational behavior. [Good strategy does not simply catalogue or
validate things already being done. Rather it fiercely commits to
turning the ship of state in a different direction---toward a clear goal
(ends) with a defined path (ways) and the means to get
there.]{.underline} Ends Ongoing diplomatic efforts will have to be
reshaped to match the National Security Strategy. [What were once called
"democracy promotion activities," just for the sake of promoting
democracy, now have to be justified as part of the American effort to
manage great power competition.]{.underline} The overall objective has
to be to protect America's interests by stabilizing global competition,
not by remaking the world order. "What is in the best interests of a
country?" is a different question than "What's in best interests of the
U.S.?" [But efforts to protect U.S. interests should aim for the sweet
spot where our goals and those of our partner countries converge.
Programs that serve these interests gain the most credibility and
legitimacy.]{.underline} There is, of course, no single solution for
achieving better outcomes everywhere. The United States will need to
pursue a variety of programs to achieve a cluster of favorable outcomes.
One effort will aim to help our friends and strategic partners
strengthen the resilience of their democratic institutions. The focus
here should be to reduce corruption and promote good, stable governance
and institutions---not to drive particular political outcomes (pushing
one political party over another) and agendas (like marriage equality).
Another effort should aim to strengthen the resilience of institutions
and infrastructure critical to our friends' economic and military
development. [Chinese and Russian "sharp power" poses a strategic threat
to many key allies.]{.underline} The administration will need to develop
specific objectives to counter this threat. A second cluster of
initiatives should be aimed at our adversaries, exploiting their
weakness and lack of credible institutions. [Authoritarian regimes in
Iran, Russia, and China pose the chief threats to regional stability
today. Such regimes are most constrained when they feel pressure from
within and without, simultaneously]{.underline}. Hence, **[it makes
sense to support reform from within while exerting external
pressure.]{.underline}** Further, by understanding their instruments of
internal repression, we better understand the means of repression these
regimes export and how to deal with them most effectively. The third
cluster should aim to build capacity in states strategically relevant to
Washington. [What's not needed is a quixotic effort to promote
democratic ideology per se. Rather, we should promote legitimate,
accountable institutions of governance.]{.underline} Democracy is
predicated upon the legitimacy of government for the governed. If, for
example, the Muslim Brotherhood is voted to power, describing the
country as a "democracy" is unhelpful because that country will bring
poor leaders to power who will poorly serve the people. As Cliff May of
The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies has noted, [it is not
enough that a regime don the "trappings" of democracy (such as
elections). What's needed is "legitimate governance." Ends ought to be
framed and measured in these terms. Also, building weak regimes'
capacity for good governance will entail battling Russian and Chinese
"corrosive capital."]{.underline}

magnitudes beyond the crises of today's detention centers and

botanical metaphor in Kagan's book title began our recent conversation.
"[We've been living in a tranquil garden of largely peaceful practices
and liberal expectations across much of the world, ignoring the dark
forces of jungle multiplying under the rocks]{.underline}. If we don't
defend civilization's cultivation---especially American's guarantee of
peace and economic integration across the world---the toxic creatures
and weeds will roar back." Thus [China's determined military

[fiery authoritarians on the march in so many once democratic

As Kagan continued, "[Trump has been damaging the
system](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/07/20/to-destroy-the-liberal-world-order-trump-putin-and-the-imperiled-trans-atlantic-alliance/)---he
too seems to have forgotten what good it has delivered---but actually
America's desire for maintaining the global order has been diminishing
for years. After [the dissolution of the Soviet empire in the
1990s](https://history.state.gov/milestones/1989-1992/collapse-soviet-union),
people talked about ['the end of
history"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man)---that
America didn't have to worry anymore about war or aggression. History
doesn't end, it simply paused. The ugliest aspects of human nature are
surging again." Vanishing Leadership, Vanishing Peace Kagan's
apocalyptic message, repeated [in other recent
writings](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/welcome-to-the-jungle/2018/10/09/0f8ffb58-cbc5-11e8-a3e6-44daa3d35ede_story.html?utm_term=.f6e9637dc215),
is lucid and terrifying, all the more devastating for its relentless use
of history. It's a footnoted plea that "we've seen this movie before."
[He reminds us that **Americans have frequently turned away from
defending world order, with regrettably familiar outcomes**: to be
dragged in later at greater cost (e.g. [helping to stop Hitler earlier
might have prevented World War
II](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/the-debate-behind-us-intervention-in-world-war-ii/277572/));
or, simply hoping that "the problem would go away," to watch it get ten
times worse (e.g. [Obama's policy in
Syria](https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/12/29/obama-never-understood-how-history-works/))]{.underline}.
Kagan acknowledges that America has sometimes misstepped (e.g. Viet Nam,
Iraq), but he still argues that overall [our foreign engagement has
produced more peace and prosperity than not. "History
shows,"]{.underline} he summarized, "[that world order has never been
achieved without some constructive force to keep the peace. The relative
harmony and fair play we've created in the modern world will vanish if
the U.S. forsakes international leadership."]{.underline} Can Today's
Peaceful Garden Be Saved? "The odds are against our preserving today's
world order," Kagan flatly commented. "But the game isn't over, and
demise isn't inevitable. But any rescue will require lots of new
thinking and bucking current political tides." I turned our discussion
to leadership, probing about the skills and mindsets of the people who
built the postwar liberal order. So what would take to rebuild it now?
His replies led to several interesting insights beyond the book per se.
Four have implications for all of us who should care about keeping the
garden safe\--as leaders in our own right, citizens of this country, and
future voters in important elections forthcoming. 1. [Today's global
liberal order was built piecemeal, evolving more through continuous
improvement than "grand design."]{.underline} Kagan quickly listed the
post-WWII [building blocks of the order, led by the U.S---"first undoing
the military capability of Japan and Germany, and then fostering their
financial success; economic integration for them and others based on
open trade]{.underline} and fair competition with America; creating a
democratic and liberal culture among allies, guaranteed by America's
power, and our willingness to punish those who threatened it." Yet he
resisted the idea of any detailed vision. "The system emerged step by
step as different American statesmen took on this or that immediate
problem. How to keep Germany and Japan from causing war again? OK, next
how to make it worthwhile for them and other nations to invest in trade
and business, not more armies? And then, later, how to push back on
Russia and Communism when they started to threaten the order?" "It
wasn't a vision but a process. [As broader benefits started to accrue,
allies saw the value, and with that we built further on what had been
achieved]{.underline}. When we made mistakes---like Viet Nam---we had
the strength to learn and course-correct, as [Reagan led us to
do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan)." So perhaps, I
reflect, thinking of our discussion, we need to stop worrying about big
theoretical frameworks, and start tackling specific problems to protect
the garden we have---and just keep learning from mistakes and building
on progress. 2. Today's order emerged from "generational leadership."
Though Kagan acknowledges contributions of well-known policy
makers---[Dean Acheson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Acheson),
[George Kennan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_F._Kennan),
[Franklin D.
Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt), [Harry
Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman) et al\-- he
de-emphasized any "[great man
theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory).\" "The legacy
was created by a whole generation, people born in the 1890s, who lived
through the optimism of the early 20th C., and then watched it collapse
in forty years of conflict. They had a shared experience, animated by
fear and memory of war, so they worked together to prevent reemergence
of the same horror. American Presidents have implicitly accepted that
challenge and reliably invested in the order---until recently." And as
we all join political debates and go to the polls in coming weeks, we
might thus ask: has the current generation of American leaders lost
touch with the risk of abandoning our global role? 3. The best leaders
refuse the "either/or" choice between domestic and foreign policy
investment. Kagan railed about [prioritizing domestic welfare over
keeping the peace
abroad](https://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/why-presidents-love-foreign-affairs/).
"Americans have periodically shied away from foreign affairs, claiming
'we can't afford to maintain military bases and also take care of our
own people.' Or that our own 'social justice' is more important than
'freedom in the world.' When we turn inwards we threaten our own
prosperity and even survival. The greatest advances in racial justice in
this country happened while we were building the liberal world order.
Our guarantees of world commerce is what allows our own economy and
people to flourish. Our military leadership is what protects us from the
evil actors gunning for us today." As we spoke further, I came to
appreciate [the complex leadership needed to build and maintain the
liberal world order]{.underline} that we still enjoy---engagement and
capabilities on three levels at the same time: first, leaders with
strength and [courage against foes]{.underline}; second, leaders that
also have empathy [and]{.underline} ability to [collaboratively guide
fractious allies]{.underline}; third, also leadership skills for
teaching and inspiring the citizens of our country. This third element
in fact sparked Kagan's final thoughts and the insight below. 4. We
desperately need leaders who can explain and mobilize the rebuilding of
this most precious asset. Kagan had a ready list to save the flagging
liberal order (indeed reversing Trump's current approach)---"rebuild our
[allies'
solidarity](https://www.state.gov/s/l/treaty/collectivedefense/);
strengthen our [global security
guarantees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security);
[re-assert the practices of free
trade](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-believe-the-spin-trump-still-hates-free-trade/2018/08/01/274544ac-95a5-11e8-a679-b09212fb69c2_story.html?utm_term=.1264c6dfd5c6);
and pressure [countries like Hungary, Poland, and Turkey to stop
backsliding on democratic
values](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21599165.2018.1491401)."
But most important, he called for [new American leadership that can
rally tomorrow's citizens around what our fathers' generation
collectively and intuitively knew---that the world is fundamentally
dangerous; that peace and prosperity are not natural; that preserving an
international liberal community **depends critically on America's
political will** to invest money and lives to keep open markets, and
prevent violence against our allies and values.]{.underline} Kagan
closed with a blend of pessimism and aspiration. "It's very difficult to
explain all this to the American people. Even the gifted FDR struggled
with the challenge. But we need a president now who can convince
Americans that preserving our global liberal system is absolutely worth
doing. That the cost of letting it come undone will be so much more than
saving it. We have to find leaders who can motivate tomorrow's
generation to join this cause, and do whatever it takes, so [our nation
can reassert our fundamentally benign---even if
self-interested---hegemony in the world."]{.underline}

The two great powers have differed, so far, chiefly in their methods.
[China has]{.underline} [until now been]{.underline} the [more
careful]{.underline}, cautious, and patient of the two, [seeking
influence primarily through its great economic clout]{.underline} and
using its growing military power chiefly as a source of deterrence and
regional intimidation. [It has not resorted to the outright use of force
yet, although]{.underline} its [actions in the South China Sea are
military in nature]{.underline}, with strategic objectives. And while
Beijing has been wary of using military force until now, **[it would be
a mistake to assume it will continue show such restraint in the
future]{.underline}** --- possibly the near future. Revisionist great
powers with growing military capabilities invariably make use of those
capabilities when they believe the possible gains outweigh the risks and
costs. **[If the Chinese perceive America's commitment to its
allies]{.underline}** and its position in the region **[to be
weakening]{.underline}**, or its capacity to make good on those
commitments to be declining, then **[they will be more inclined
to]{.underline}** attempt to **[use the power they are acquiring in
order to achieve their objectives]{.underline}**. As the trend lines
draw closer, [this is where the first crisis is likely to take
place]{.underline}. [Russia has been far more aggressive]{.underline}.
[It has invaded]{.underline} two neighboring states ---
[Georgia]{.underline} in 2008 [and Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014 --- and
in both cases hived off significant portions of those two nations'
sovereign territory. Given the intensity with which the United States
and its allies would have responded to such actions during the four
decades of the Cold War, their [relative lack of a response]{.underline}
must have [sent quite a signal to the Kremlin]{.underline} --- and to
others around the world. Moscow then followed by sending substantial
forces into Syria. [It has used its dominance of European energy markets
as a weapon]{.underline}. [It has used cyberwarfare against neighboring
states. It has engaged in extensive information warfare on a global
scale.]{.underline} More recently, [the Russian government]{.underline}
has [deployed]{.underline} a weapon that the Chinese either lack or have
so far chosen not to deploy --- [the ability to interfere directly in
Western electoral processes]{.underline}, both to influence their
outcomes and more generally to discredit the democratic system. Russia
funds right-wing populist parties across Europe, including in France;
uses its media outlets to support favored candidates and attack others;
has disseminated "fake news" to influence voters, most recently in
Italy's referendum; and has hacked private communications in order to
embarrass those it wishes to defeat. This past year, Russia for the
first time employed this powerful weapon against the United States,
heavily interfering in the American electoral process. Although Russia,
by any measure, is the weaker of the two great powers, [it has so far
had more success than China in accomplishing its objective of dividing
and disrupting the West.]{.underline} Although Russia, by any measure,

than China in accomplishing its objective of dividing and disrupting the
West. [Its interference in Western democratic political
systems]{.underline}, its [information warfare]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} its [role in creating increased refugee flows from
Syria into Europe have all contributed to the sapping of Europeans'
confidence in their political systems and established political
parties]{.underline}. Its military intervention in Syria, contrasted
with American passivity, has exacerbated existing doubts about American
staying power in the region. Beijing, until recently, has succeeded
mostly in driving American allies closer to the United States out of
concern for growing Chinese power --- but that could change quickly,
especially if the United States continues on its present trajectory.
**[There are signs that regional powers are already
recalculating]{.underline}**: [East Asian countries are contemplating
regional trade agreements that need not include the United
States]{.underline} or, in the case of [the Philippines, are actively
courting China]{.underline}, while a number of [nations in Eastern and
Central Europe are moving closer to Russia]{.underline}, both
strategically and ideologically. We could soon face a situation where
**[both great revisionist powers]{.underline}** **[are]{.underline}**
acting aggressively, including by military means, **[posing extreme
challenges to American and global security in two regions at
once.]{.underline}** Then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump

to signal their reluctance to uphold the world order]{.underline} they
created after World War II. Donald Trump was not the only major
political figure in this past election season to call for a much
narrower definition of American interests and a lessening of the burdens
of American global leadership. President Obama and Bernie Sanders both
expressed a version of "America First." The candidate who spoke often of
America's "indispensable" global role lost, and even Hillary Clinton
felt compelled to jettison her earlier support for the Trans-Pacific
Partnership. At the very least, [there should be doubts about the
American public's willingness to continue supporting the international
alliance structure, denying the revisionist powers their desired spheres
of influence and regional hegemony, and upholding democratic and free
market norms in the international system. **The weakness at the core of
the democratic world and the shedding by the United States of global
responsibilities have already encouraged a more aggressive revisionism
by the dissatisfied powers.**]{.underline} Coming as it does at a time
of growing great-power competition, [this narrowing definition of
American interests will likely hasten **a return to the instability and
clashes of previous eras**]{.underline}**.** The weakness at the core of
the democratic world and the shedding by the United States of global
responsibilities have already encouraged a more aggressive revisionism
by the dissatisfied powers. That, in turn, has further sapped the
democratic world's confidence and willingness to resist. History
suggests that **[this is a downward spiral from which it will be
difficult to recover]{.underline}**, absent a rather dramatic shift of
course by the United States.

[China is the single most formidable peer competitive threat faced by
the United States. It alone has the potential to replace the United
States as the world's hegemon, an ambition the Soviets may have
possessed but never could have achieved due to their weaknesses,
particularly economically.]{.underline} We can foresee a future where
China has the ability to force Washington to yield and cede its regional
and global interests in favor of Beijing's. China's greater willingness
to use coercion to advance its interests provides a window into that
future, as its territorial expansion and militarization of the South
China Sea illuminate. [Whether the United States can remain the
preeminent force for free and open societies in the face of a rising
China is the defining element of international politics in the
twenty-first century, and the most immediate U.S. national security
policy interest.]{.underline} An understanding of the future of the
Sino-American confrontation entails an understanding of why both China
and the United States are motivated for conflict. Despite the importance
of the issue, the nature and scope of the threat are still not fully
grasped in America. However, there are three ways to understand
Sino-American confrontation. First, there are the causes: the change in
the balance of power in China's favor and the conflicting ideologies of
the two states. Second, the United States leadership and the American
people must understand "Why China Fights." That is, what the Chinese
leadership want, and why they are willing to fight America. Third,
Americans must grasp "Why the U.S. Fights," to maintain freedom and
other liberal values and to preserve its dominant position, while
comprehending the fundamental advantages Washington possesses.
Illuminating the two conceptions of victory demonstrates the ultimate
and irreconcilable gap in the visions for international politics between
Washington and Beijing, and consequently why conflict---certainly cold,
and very possibly hot---is inevitable. The Causes of the Sino-American
Conflict: Shifting Balance of Power and Ideology

History? Jul 18 1976 Nadia Comaneci became the first person in Olympic
Games history to score a perfect 10 in gymnastics at the 1976 Summer
Olympics. The Government of Detroit, with up to \$20 billion in debt,
files for the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. From both
the Chinese and American perspectives, two fundamental factors explain
the source of the conflict. [First, the Sino-American struggle is
material---economic and military power matter, particularly the shifting
balance of relative power from the United States to China.]{.underline}
This shift feeds ambition in China and fear in Washington. Given its
strongly nationalistic and ethnocentric beliefs, China as a rising
hegemon would challenge any dominant state---as it did the United States
and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It is of historical importance
that this is the first time in its long history that China is a rising
hegemon. In its past, it was the dominant state in Asia---the primary
world it knew. Even after its defeat in the First Opium War, China
maintained the pretension that it was still dominant until colonization
by Europeans, Japanese, and Americans forced the abandonment of its
pretensions. Now, for the first time in its history, China is the
challenger to the dominant state. This is something new in the history
of empires because the example of China shows you can be on top, lose it
all, and return to greatness or even dominance. In historical context,
this is a remarkably impressive feat---unmatched by any empire in
history. Second, the cause of the struggle is also inherently
ideological. Ideology illuminates what will be gained for the
victor---the return of the Middle Kingdom or the triumph of
freedom---and what will be lost for the defeated. It inspires the
leadership and population of both sides. It also provides an
understanding of the intensity of passion on the Chinese side---the
hatred for America for hindering China's return to its rightful position
and for Washington's arrogance. Beijing and Chinese citizens are also
upset with Americans for not realizing its time is past, and so it must
yield gracefully to the new hegemon. Yet so far, a concomitant level of
strategic focus and passion is absent on the U.S. side. That needs to
change. [Report

"Why China Fights:" The Return of the Middle Kingdom The Chinese seek
confrontation in order to achieve their conception of victory---the
return of the Middle Kingdom's suzerainty and the replacement of
Washington by Beijing as the dominant power in international politics.
This ambition is a natural one for the Chinese leadership and
population, and is caused by their conception of China's place in the
world. [For the Chinese, or more particularly, the majority Han
population, there is the supremacist belief that the Han are the
greatest people,]{.underline} the creators of the most sophisticated
polity, and to whom other peoples and states should be deferential.
[Report

For Han-supremacists, it is right and proper that China dominates
international politics because China was the most advanced, culturally
refined, and humane civilization in history. Han-supremacy is anchored
in millennia and is a core component of Chinese political culture.
Consequently, it is a far deeper force than Communism or capitalism. Han
culture is viewed as the epitome of civilized life and contains
traditional values of industriousness, discipline, patriotism, love of
the Han and their history. In essence, the Chinese seek a Warren
Hardingesque "return to normalcy," where they resume their position as
the epitome of civilization and the world's fountainhead of economic and
political power. For its adherents, the United States is a malevolent
force which seeks to prevent the natural and right order of
international politics---Chinese hegemony---from returning. This
perspective is not likely to change. Beijing will fight the United
States because it is the single major impediment to China's strategic
objectives. With America removed, there is no single power, or
constellation of powers such as Australia, Japan, and India, that could
prevent Beijing from achieving its aims, which Xi Jinping transparently
and boldly advances in his conception of a hegemonic China by 2049. The
United States is the barrier to the realization of China's ambitions and
is its ideological opponent, and so it is the focus of China's enmity.
"Why the U.S. Fights:" Preservation of Freedom [U.S. leadership seeks to
maintain its position because that is best, first, for U.S. security;
second, the security of its allies; and third, for the promotion of its
ideology. America's ideological push is vital to ensure that freedom and
democratic government, open societies, and free markets are the dominant
values of international politics. In sum, Washington fights for the
international order it created after World War II, and which it expanded
after the Cold War.]{.underline} America seeks to maintain the status
quo, its position and the order it has known, and that both Washington
and the American people expect to continue. That expectation was
conceived and conditioned in the calm geopolitical seas of the 1990s and
2000s. That time is past. [As China has risen, Washington must now
battle to maintain its place in the world and the dominance of its
military, economy, ideology, and technological leadership. Indeed,
America is forced to fight to defend its position, allies, and values.
But this cannot be wholly a defensive war, the United States must
actively confront China in each realm, and put China on the back foot in
order to ensure the United States and its allies triumph in each aspect
of the competition.]{.underline} [Report

While the military and economic components are essential, ideology is
their equal. Ideology is critical for Washington as it motivates the
U.S. response to China with a comprehension, energy, and vigor that
material forces cannot. As the U.S. Navy historically contends: "ships
don't fight, men do." People fight to defend their country and ideology.
Accordingly, the value of the ideology of the United States is the spine
that supports U.S. power. U.S. ideology unifies and inspires the
American people, as well as ideological sympathizers around the world,
and explains why China's ideology and vision for the world should be
resisted. In explaining "Why We Fight," the United States must contrast
its dynamic, innovative, free, and open society, with the wealthy and
increasingly prosperous, but ethnocentric, racist, and closed society of
the Chinese. The West went through a Civil Rights Movement to create
cultures of anti-racism throughout their societies. In China, the idea
of a Civil Rights Movement that would aid the condition of women and
minorities, and so undermine Han-supremacy, is unthinkable. That stark
recognition captures the profound differences between the two societies.
Equally importantly, U.S. ideology may serve to undermine the legitimacy
of the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party of China in the minds
of the Chinese people. [Report

[Ideology also provides Washington with key advantages. As a free and
open society, the United States is a better ally for states in Africa,
Asia, and Latin America, than China, whose alliances are frequently
characterized by abuse of its erstwhile ally's people and resources. In
contrast to China, U.S. decision-making is transparent to allies, it is
a dynamic and inclusive society, and has a long history of protecting
the interests of its allies, and treating them as equal partners.
America's free and open political principles make the United States a
more valuable and dependable ally.]{.underline}

Then [there is the question of maintaining America's military
predominance]{.underline} in the international system. [For all the talk
of "soft" power and "smart" power, it is ultimately]{.underline} the
American security guarantee, [the ability to deploy hard power to deter
and defeat potential aggressors, that provides the essential foundation
without which the liberal world order could never survive]{.underline}.
Members of Congress from both parties have underfunded the military
since the beginning of the post--Cold War era, but especially over the
last decade. Defense secretaries from both parties have raised alarms
about the increasing inability of the armed forces to perform their
missions of deterrence around the world. And [the dangers of war have
only grown in recent years]{.underline}, not diminished. [Americans need
to remember that deterring a war is much less expensive than fighting
one. **It is not only the money to preserve power**]{.underline},
however, **[but]{.underline} [also the willingness to apply that power,
with all the pain and the suffering]{.underline}**[, **the uncertainties
and the errors**]{.underline}, th[e failures and follies, the immorality
and brutality, the lost lives and the lost treasure.]{.underline} Most
of what we need to do to sustain the liberal order will not require
sending troops, but there will be times when it will be necessary. [It
is simply dishonest to tell]{.underline} the American [people that the
relative security and prosperity they have enjoyed can be sustained
without the occasional threat or use of force]{.underline}. There will
be challenges on the Korean Peninsula, in the South China Sea, in the
Middle East, and along the fault lines between Russia and NATO. [**We
would like to be sure that there will be no more Iraqs and Vietnams**,
and we should do our best, learning from past mistakes, to avoid such
failures**.**]{.underline} But [it would be foolish to imagine we can
avoid mistakes and failures entirely. **There is no doctrine other than
pure isolation and inaction that can prevent such
tragedies.**]{.underline} The Obama administration offered a doctrine of
not doing "stupid" things; others have spoken of the need to fight only
"necessary" not "unnecessary" wars; in the past people have argued for
fighting only for "vital" national interests in "core" areas and
avoiding fights in the "periphery." The problem with all of these
sensible-sounding proposals is that [**it is often only in hindsight
that we can be sure what was "stupid"** and what was
"necessary,"]{.underline} what was "vital" and what was "peripheral" and
safely ignored. There were many smart people who believed that American
intervention in Vietnam was essential to forestall a communist victory,
that it was a vital strategic interest for the United States, partly to
protect Japan and partly in the overall effort to resist aggression. [An
equally long and distinguished list of foreign policy thinkers and
politicians supported the war in Iraq because they believed it was vital
to protect the world from what most believed were Iraq's WMD programs
and from a serial aggressor and mass killer. Later on, when those
efforts failed]{.underline}, when the intelligence proved faulty and the
political-military strategies inadequate, [many of those who supported
those wars declared]{.underline} not only that they were a mistake but
[they were an obvious and avoidable mistake]{.underline}---even though
they themselves did not see it at the time. That is one of the problems:
**[many mistakes are not obvious until they are made]{.underline}**.
**[So]{.underline}**, **[too]{.underline}**, **[the distinction between
supposedly "necessary" and "unnecessary" wars]{.underline}**. **[Prior
to December 1941]{.underline}** and Germany's declaration of war on the
United States, many American experts and **[the great majority of the
American people did not think it was necessary to go to war in Europe to
defeat Hitler]{.underline}**. As for wars on the periphery, the world is
not a collection of distinct regions neatly walled off from one another.
We may call one region "Europe," one "Asia," and one "the Middle East,"
and we may say we will intervene in one but not the other. This is an
artificial construct, however. Regions abut one another and bleed into
one another; their histories, cultures, and religions as well as their
economies are tightly entangled. Great powers have been intervening in
the Middle East and Persian Gulf for centuries, before there was oil and
before there was a Suez Canal. [To extricate ourselves from the Middle
East would mean extricating ourselves from the world connected to and
through the whole region]{.underline}. Even that might not keep us from
having to intervene. In recent decades we have learned, tragically, that
**[what happens in the Middle East does not stay in the Middle
East]{.underline}**. Americans would love never to have to think about
the Middle East again, but no administration has succeeded in
extricating the United States from it---not even Obama. Meanwhile, [the
more we rely on proxies like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Israel to
determine the course of events in the Middle East, the less it will be a
course we would choose]{.underline}. [Even if they could manage the task
without us]{.underline}, which seems unlikely, [it will be their
interests they will be protecting, not ours]{.underline}, and not those
of the liberal order. For the United States, it is not a question of all
in or all out. We cannot intervene everywhere, and we haven't ever come
close to doing so. In the Middle East and elsewhere, we will still be
required to make decisions: when to intervene, how to intervene, how
much to commit, and how long to stay, and the answers will not be
obvious and the outcomes will not be certain or even predictable. Nor
will our interventions "solve" the problem; or they will solve one
problem and create others. **[Those who insist on outcomes that pose no
further dangers and require no further involvement are asking the
impossible]{.underline}**. Our intervention in World War II defeated
Hitler but led to Soviet communist control of half of Europe and four
decades of Cold War. That is the messy reality. President Obama said he
didn't like the idea of just putting a lid on problems like Syria. But
the most masterful foreign policies in history, whether those of a
Bismarck or a Disraeli, have always been about containing rather than
solving problems. America's entire grand strategy since World War II has
been about putting lids on problems, in Europe, in Asia, and elsewhere.
Whether that is good or bad depends on what's under the lid and whether
it is better to keep things under it than to let them out. T[he American
people would like a foreign policy that avoids mistakes and
disasters]{.underline}, and who can blame them? [But that is a bit like
wanting to throw touchdowns but not interception]{.underline}s, to make
only good investment decisions, [or to win all your cases.]{.underline}
The price of failures in **[foreign policy]{.underline}** is measured in
human lives and national treasure, and therefore the greatest care must
be taken to get it right, but it **[nevertheless remains a human
activity and therefore subject]{.underline}** both **[to]{.underline}**
our foibles **[and the failure of our best-intentioned efforts to
predict the future]{.underline}.** People don't stop what they're doing
after a mistake is made; they try to do a better job next time. **[We
can't quit having a foreign policy, even if our geography, our wealth,
and our power sorely tempt us to try.]{.underline}** There are,
moreover, two kinds of errors: errors of commission and errors of
omission. After World War I, Americans were more focused on the former;
after World War II, they worried more about the latter. Today we are
fixated almost entirely on errors of commission. A couple of years ago,
Robert Merry, the editor of The American Conservative, made a list of
"America's Five Biggest Foreign Policy Fiascoes." At the top of the list
was Iraq, followed by America's entry into World War I, the Vietnam War,
the intervention in Somalia, and the Bay of Pigs "invasion." These were
all acts of commission. But [**what about the "fiascoes" that resulted
from our failure to act?** What about our failure to destroy al
Qaeda]{.underline} bases in Afghanistan [before three thousand people
were killed in the Twin Towers]{.underline} and the Pentagon; [or the
failure either to deter]{.underline} or to prepare adequately for [a
Japanese attack on the Philippines, which led]{.underline} in early 1942
[to the death of ten thousand American and Filipino
soldiers]{.underline} in three months of fighting followed by the deaths
of thousands more in the infamous Bataan Death March? Was that not a far
worse error than the tragedy which led to eighteen American dead in
Mogadishu**[? What about the price the liberal world order, and
particularly America's key allies in Europe, have paid for our failure
to contain the crisis in Syria?]{.underline}** Were not these errors of
omission more costly than our errors of commission in Somalia? [At the
root of such thinking is the belief that]{.underline} there is an escape
from power or that [it is possible to wield power without error and
without failure]{.underline}. Americans, blessed by their favorable
geography and wealth, still believe they have a choice between engaging
the world and letting the world fend for itself. There has been no
shortage of realists, idealists, progressives, and conservatives telling
them that substantially disengaging from our alliances and overseas
commitments is possible and cost-free. But [the real choice we face is
not between the good and the bad but between the bad and the
worse.]{.underline} **[It is between maintaining the liberal world
order]{.underline}**, with all the moral and material costs that
entails[, **or letting it collapse and courting the catastrophes that
must inevitably follow.**]{.underline}

So, [yes, the liberal order has been flawed, with its share of failure
and hypocrisy]{.underline}. Liberal goals have sometimes been pursued by
illiberal means. Power, coercion and violence have played a big part.
The order has been the product of American hegemony and it has also
served to reinforce that hegemony. [But to note these facts is hardly to
condemn the order. No order of any kind can exist without some element
of hegemony.]{.underline} The Roman order was based on the hegemony of
Rome; the British order of the 18th and 19th centuries was based on the
hegemony of the Royal Navy; such order as existed briefly in Europe
after the defeat of Napoleon---the so-called Concert of Europe---rested
on the collective hegemony of the four victorious great powers. [The
idea of a peaceful, stable multipolar world]{.underline} where no power
or powers enjoy predominance [is a dream that exists only in the minds
of one-world idealists and international relations theorists. The same
is true of those who would condemn the liberal world order because of
the persistence of violence]{.underline}, coercion, hypocrisy,
selfishness, stupidity and all the other evils and foibles [endemic to
human nature]{.underline}. Perhaps in the confines of academia it is
possible to imagine a system of international relations where our deeply
flawed humanness is removed from the equation. But **[in the real
world]{.underline}**, **[even the best and most moral of international
arrangements are going to have their dark, immoral
aspects.]{.underline}** The question is, as always, compared to what?
Patrick [Porter]{.underline}, the author of a widely discussed critique
of the liberal world order, [acknowledges that "if there was to be a
superpower]{.underline} emerging from the rubble of world war in
midcentury, [we should be grateful it was the United
States]{.underline}, [given the totalitarian alternatives on
offer.]{.underline} Under America's aegis, there were islands of liberty
where prosperous markets and democracies grew." Indeed, that would seem
to be the key point. [At any given time there are only so many
alternatives]{.underline}, and usually the choice is between the bad and
the worse. Are the alternatives on offer so much better now? Graham
[Allison]{.underline}, dismissing any return to the "imagined past" when
the United States shaped an international liberal order, [proposes that
we instead make the world "safe for diversity"]{.underline} [and
accommodate]{.underline} ourselves to "the reality [that other
countries]{.underline} have contrary views about governance and [seek to
establish their own international orders]{.underline} governed by their
own rules." [Others]{.underline}, such as Peter Beinart, similarly
[argue that we should accommodate Russian and Chinese demands for their
own spheres of interest]{.underline}, even if that entails the sacrifice
of sovereign peoples such as Ukrainians and Taiwanese. This wonderfully
diverse world would presumably be run partly by Xi Jinping, partly by
Vladimir Putin, and partly, too, by the Ayatollah Khamenei and by Kim
Jong Un, who would also like to establish orders governed by their own
rules. We have not enjoyed such diversity since the world was run partly
by Hitler, Stalin and Mussolini. [The idea that this is the solution to
our problems is laughable]{.underline}. Porter points out American
policy has led to "multiplying foreign conflicts" and put the United
States "on a collision course with rivals." Setting aside the fact that
[multiplying foreign conflicts and collisions between rivals is the
natural state of international relations in any era]{.underline}, it is
hard for any student of history to imagine that these problems would
lessen if only we returned to the competitive multipolar world of the
19th and early 20th centuries. [To suggest that there could be a world
with no collisions and no foreign conflicts, if only the United States
would pursue an intelligent policy, is the very opposite of
realism]{.underline}. **[Strikingly absent from all these
critiques]{.underline}** of the liberal world order, too**[, is any
suggestion of an alternative approach]{.underline}**. The critiques end
with lists of questions that need to be answered. Allison calls for a
"surge of strategic thinking." [Others call for "new thinking" about
"difficult trade-offs."]{.underline} Some critics even complain that so
long as people continue to talk about a U.S.-dominated liberal order, it
will be "impossible for us to construct a reasonable alternative for the
future." The most [the critiques]{.underline} will [offer]{.underline}
are [suggestions that sound more like attitudes than
policies]{.underline}. They throw around words like "realism,"
"restraint" and "retrenchment." Allison proposes that the United States
"limit its efforts to ensuring sufficient order abroad."
[Beinart]{.underline} comes closest to offering an alternative, but he
[clearly has not yet thought it through fully.]{.underline} He wants to
grant other powers their spheres of interest, for instance, but [he
mentions only Russia and China.]{.underline} Does this mean Russia
should be granted full sway in, say, Ukraine, the Balkans, the Baltics
and the Caucuses? Should China be able to impose its will on the
Philippines and Vietnam? And [what of the other great
powers?]{.underline} [Does Japan get its own sphere of
interest?]{.underline} Does India? Do Germany, France and Britain? They
all had their spheres a century ago, and of course **[it was the clashes
over those inevitably overlapping spheres that led to all the great
wars]{.underline}**. Is Beinart suggesting we should return to that
past? Of course, we may be moving toward that world, anyway. That is the
implication of Trump's "America First" foreign policy philosophy, his
attacks on "globalism" and his recent suggestion that all nations look
out strictly for themselves. Trump's speech at the U.N. was an
invitation to global anarchy, a struggle of all against all. His
boasting about American power put the world on notice that the United
States was turning from supporter of a liberal order to rogue
superpower. This breakdown may be our future, but it seems odd to choose
that course as a deliberate strategy, as Allison and others seem to do.
Little wonder that [they don't wish to spell out the details of their
alternative but prefer to carp at the inevitable failures and
imperfections of the liberal world we have.]{.underline} As John Hay
once remarked, "Our good friends are wiser when they abuse us for what
we do, than when they try to say what ought to be done." [No honest
person would deny that the liberal world order has been flawed and will
continue to be flawed]{.underline} in the future. The League of Nations
was also flawed, as was Woodrow Wilson's vision of collective security.
Yet the world would have been better had the United States joined in
upholding it, given the genuine alternative. The enduring truth about
**[the liberal world order]{.underline}** is that, like Churchill's
comment about democracy, it **[is the worst system---except for all the
others.]{.underline}**

[Different kinds of international systems confront hegemons with varying
relationships between military capabilities (protection) and the economy
(production)]{.underline}. In different ideal-type "worlds,"
complementarity between protection and production---and therefore the
costs and benefits of hegemony---add up very differently. These worlds
map on to different historical international 5 Cf. Christopher Layne,
"This Time It's Real: The End of Unipolarity and the Pax Americana,"
International Studies Quarterly 56, no. 1 (March 2012): 203--13; quote
on 207. systems and, it turns out, different key arguments often
propounded as universal in the literature on hegemony. [The first set of
highly relevant interactions that vary through time concerns productive
economic activity and military strength. Here the key variation pertains
to the degree to which military strength is necessary for wealth and the
degree to which civilian economic productivity is necessary for military
power]{.underline} (see Table 1). When strong states can grab economic
resources by force, military power is necessary to protect and acquire
wealth. Under these circumstances, militarily weak states can create
wealth, but they cannot protect wealth. Militarily powerful states do
not need to create wealth; they can acquire wealth by conquering and
looting weaker states. Under these conditions, states can be affluent
without a productive civilian economy but not without military
capability. Easy lootability clearly has implications for the
profitability of being a militarily potent economic predator[. When
civilian economic productivity is not required for military power, we
are in a stark "state-of-nature" world in which economically
unproductive military powerhouses routinely subjugate and loot more
productive polities]{.underline} (northwest quadrant of Table 1). In the
fourteenth century, Ibn Khaldun proposed a cyclical theory of history
that presumed just such a world.6 Unproductive but militarily powerful
societies conquered productive polities until the erstwhile barbarians
themselves succumbed to the weakening effect of civilization, only to be

International Relations Theory Today, ed. Ken Booth and Steve Smith
(University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1995), 172.
conquered by the next set of barbarians. 7 [In such a world, the
economic benefits of military primacy are obvious. In other cases,
wealth is easily lootable, but civilian productivity is necessary for
military power (southwest quadrant). Militarily strong states can still
raid, but the spoils of conquest are insufficient to finance military
prowess: indigenous economic capability is required]{.underline}. When
the positive relationship between those who have military power and
those who have wealth breaks down, a trade-off emerges. [Developing
productive economic activity diverts resources from maintaining a
coercive capability, and vice versa. Managing this trade-off is
necessary for political and economic survival. States exclusively
relying on booty for enrichment to fund military prowess will be
outcompeted by states mixing predatory looting with a productive
civilian economy.]{.underline} Until the mid-twentieth century, this
hybrid strategy was necessary to achieve great-power status, explaining
the advantage of colonial powers (for example, Portugal, Spain, France,
the Netherlands, Great Britain, Germany, Belgium, and Italy's) over
noncolonial powers.8 [Relatively unproductive states may seek to
overwhelm that trade-off through massive resource extraction, as the
Soviet Union did in the mid-twentieth century (northeast quadrant). But
the postindustrial and information revolutions stacked the odds against
that approach]{.underline}.9 Because the Soviet empire was created and
maintained in a systemic setting 7 For a theoretical discussion, see Kai

Peter Liberman, Does Conquest Pay? The Exploitation of Occupied
Industrial Societies (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1996);
Stephen G. Brooks, Producing hostile to pillaging, it was short-lived by
historical standards. This overall setting prevailed with increasing
strength after the industrial revolution and into the twenty and
twenty-first centuries (southeast quadrant). During this time, however,
military power continues to play a role in establishing and enforcing
property rights. To some degree, therefore, wealth still emerges from
the barrel of a gun.1 [These four "possible worlds" derived from the
relationship between military strength and wealth creation under
conditions of low versus high barriers to plunder directly contradict a
long tradition of rise-and-decline scholarship: there can be no
universal theory of imperial overstretch. The costs and benefits of
establishing and sustaining military primacy are contingent upon a

premodern worlds, specializing in military conquest could be profitable
for centuries. Yet the complementarities and trade-offs captured in
Table 1 did not figure prominently in the 1980s hegemony literature.
[This underlay the era's focus on public-goods theory and the popular
contention that security provision by a dominant actor will tend to
prove too burdensome, as others free ride]{.underline}.15 [The key
benefit of free riding on US security was reaping the obvious welfare
benefits associated with economic competition. The debate at the time
centered on whether the United States itself could somehow exit the
"atavistic" world of militarized competition or get dependent allies to
assume greater burdens]{.underline}. The whole debate assumed a
power--protection trade-off. You could be a trading state or an atavist
military juggernaut---not both. As the next section shows, however, this
debate missed the core argument here: even in the southwest quadrant,
complementarity may emerge through the logic of raison de l'Hégémonie.

#### Heg is the only system wherein states can realize objectives---all ev to the contrary is based on false 1980s assumptions without context to modern-day studies

[The nature, durability, and politics of hegemonic order depends
crucially on the costs and benefits to the hegemon of providing security
beyond its borders.]{.underline} We have shown that, under some
conditions, **[raison de l'Hégémonie pays externally]{.underline}**.
Focusing on the leading state itself and on the conditions under which
protection complements production, the theory developed here addresses a
part of the larger debate on the nature of hegemonic order featured in
this special issue. Yet it is a central one. For, as we have shown,
failure to appreciate the potential for raison 69 Carla Norrlof and
William C. Wohlforth, "Is US Grand Strategy Self-Defeating? Deep
Engagement, Military Spending and Sovereign Debt," Conflict Management
and Peace Science (2016): <https://doi.org/10.1177/0738894216674953>.
[Raison de l'Hégémonie explains why so many scholars misdiagnosed the
staying power of the US-led order. A state's **military and economic
capability has always been the most fundamental predictor** **of its
ability to realize national objectives**, and the optimal balance and
feedback between these forms of material capability varies through
time.]{.underline} To understand whether maintaining military capability
comes at the expense of thriving economic capability, or whether the
material basis for hegemony is mutually reinforcing, we posited two
highly contextdependent sets of interactions. [The first concerns the
degree to which military strength is necessary for wealth and the degree
to which civilian economic productivity is necessary for military power.
The second concerns the global economy's sensitivity to insecurity and
the effect of economic openness on a state's security]{.underline}.
Using these interactions, we unpacked the post--midtwentieth-century
setting: a productive civilian economy necessary for generating military
power that is useful for other than predatory economic purposes residing
within an international economy highly sensitive to security shocks
where states are more secure with economic openness than closure. [These
circumstances have profound implications for the structure of the
international system]{.underline}. They offer few incentives to
specialize in military power for gain. Only states with a sufficiently
productive economy capable of funding coercive specialization can avoid
sharp trade-offs. Even so, possessing a vibrant economy does not
necessarily provide incentives to allocate resources to the military
sector over and above what is required in pursuit of safe borders and
other strategic interests captured by raison d'état. [To specialize in
defensive and offensive capability requires a different rationale.
Raison de l'Hégémonie is based on the premise that as the single largest
military and economic power, the hegemon must sustain the capacity to
protect the international economy for pecuniary reasons both in order to
continue benefiting from open exchange and to fund military
prowess.]{.underline} **[Securing the international system represents
potential benefits beyond what a mere economic capability edge can
achieve; pursuing raison de l'Hégémonie offers opportunities to form
lasting relationships that produce brokering opportunities and raise a
state's degrees of freedom.]{.underline}** The public-goods dilemma of
collective action applies comparatively weakly to the US security
network, which more accurately resembles a system of competing club
goods. [But even if we were to consider this joint system of competing
club goods as individual components in a larger public-good effort, the
United States has the ability to use preferential access within its web
of security relationships to transform public goods into excludable club
goods or impure public goods by creating some degree of
rivalry.]{.underline} Under these circumstances, international
cooperation is no longer a sure drain on the United States either
systemically or within specific alliances. In short, being at the center
of a system of defensive alliances offers distinct rewards in the form
of fewer constraints, more opportunities, better bargains, greater
influence, and even deference and attention from those in less favored
positions. [Security provision bolsters economic exchange, provides
economic leverage, and encourages socialization.]{.underline} [The US
decline debates of the 1980s exaggerated the scale, trajectory, and
significance of protection costs largely due to the failure to
appreciate shifts in the structural and strategic setting, as well as
the effect of security relationships on economic processes. Scholars
therefore missed elements of stability in the US global
position]{.underline}. [Significantly, they did not situate the
costbenefit assessment of US hegemony in a larger structural context
specifying potential complementarity between military power (protection)
and economically productive activity (production). In addition, they
failed to consider the social sources of power, which military power can
foster and which accrues over time.]{.underline} Our assessment of the
current setting suggests that **[these omissions still characterize much
declinist thinking and policy prescription.]{.underline}** Both will
therefore continue to underestimate the significance of US security
provision and of maintaining security alliances for bolstering the
economic order and for US security. The proposed new order is the
quickest path from a world of complementarity to one of clear trade-offs
where US decline will be "for real."

### AT: Russia & China War

#### The US' global military alliances and unmatched conventional naval and airpower ensure victory in war against Russia and China

Simultaneously?," *the National Interest*, 3-20-2019, URL:

**[The United States can still fight and win two major wars at the same
time, or at least come near enough to winning that neither Russia nor
China would see much hope in the gamble]{.underline}**. The United
States can do this because [it continues to maintain the world's most
formidable military, and]{.underline} because [it stands at the head of
an extremely powerful military alliance.]{.underline} The United States
discarded its oft-misunderstood "two war" doctrine, intended as a
template for providing the means to fight two regional wars
simultaneously, late last decade. Designed to deter North Korea from
launching a war while the United States was involved in fighting against
Iran or Iraq (or vice versa,) the idea helped give form to the
Department of Defense's procurement, logistical and basing strategies in
the post--Cold War, when the United States no longer needed to face down
the Soviet threat. The United States backed away from the doctrine
because of changes in the international system, including the rising
power of China and the proliferation of highly effective terrorist
networks. But what if the United States had to fight two wars today, and
not against states like North Korea and Iran? [What if China and Russia
sufficiently coordinated with one another to engage in simultaneous
hostilities in the Pacific and in Europe?]{.underline} Political
Coordination Could Beijing and Moscow coordinate a pair of crises that
would drive two separate U.S. military responses? Maybe, but probably
not. [Each country has its own goals, and works on its own timeline.
More likely, one of the two would opportunistically take advantage of an
existing crisis to further its regional claims]{.underline}. For
example, [Moscow might]{.underline} well [decide to push the Baltic
States]{.underline} if the United States became involved in a major
skirmish in the South China Sea. In any case, the war would start on the
initiative of either Moscow or Beijing. The United States enjoys the
benefits of the status quo in both areas, and generally (at least where
great powers are concerned) prefers to use diplomatic and economic means
to pursue its political ends. [While the U.S. might create the
conditions for war, Russia or China would pull the trigger.]{.underline}
Flexibility: On the upside, only some of the requirements for fighting
in Europe and the Pacific overlap. As was the case in World War II, [the
U.S. Army would bear the brunt of defending Europe, while the Navy would
concentrate on the Pacific. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) would play a
supporting role in both theaters. **Russia lacks the ability to fight
NATO in the North Atlantic, and probably has no political interest in
trying.**]{.underline} This means that while [the United States and its
NATO allies can allocate some resources to threatening Russia's maritime
spac]{.underline}e (and providing insurance against a Russian naval
sortie,) [the U.S. Navy]{.underline} (USN) [can concentrate its forces
in the Pacific]{.underline}. Depending on the length of the conflict and
the degree of warning provided, the United States could transport
considerable U.S. Army assets to Europe to assist with any serious
fighting. [The bulk of American carriers, submarines and surface vessels
would concentrate in the Pacific and the Indian Oceans, fighting
directly against China's A2/AD system and sitting astride China's
maritime transit lanes.]{.underline} Long range aviation, including
stealth bombers and similar assets, would operate in both theaters as
needed. **[The U.S. military would be under strong pressure to deliver
decisive victory in at least one theater as quickly as
possible.]{.underline}** This might push the [United States to lean
heavily in one direction with air, space and cyber assets, hoping to
achieve a strategic and political victory]{.underline} that would allow
the remainder of its weight to shift to the other theater. Given the
strength of U.S. allies in Europe, the United States might initially
focus on the conflict in the Pacific. Alliance Structure: U.S. alliance
structure in the Pacific differs dramatically from that of Europe.
Notwithstanding concern over the commitment of specific U.S. allies in
Europe, the United States has no reason to fight Russia apart from
maintaining the integrity of the NATO alliance. [If the United States
fights, then Germany, France, Poland and the United Kingdom will
follow.]{.underline} In most conventional scenarios, [**even the
European allies alone would give NATO a tremendous medium term advantage
over the Russians**; Russia]{.underline} might take parts of the
Baltics, but it [would suffer heavily under NATO airpower]{.underline},
and likely couldn't hold stolen territory for long. In this context, the
USN and USAF would largely play support and coordinative roles, giving
the NATO allies the advantage they needed to soundly defeat the
Russians. **[The U.S. nuclear force would provide insurance against a
Russian decision to employ tactical or strategic nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}** The United States faces more difficult problems
in the Pacific. Japan or India might have an interest in the South China
Sea, but this hardly guarantees their participation in a war (or even
the degree of benevolence of their neutrality.) [The alliance structure
of any given conflict would depend on the particulars of that conflict;
any of the Philippines, Vietnam, South Korea, Japan or Taiwan could
become China's primary]{.underline} target. The rest, U.S. pressure
aside, might well prefer to sit on the sidelines. This would put extra
pressure on the United States to establish dominance in the Western
Pacific with its own assets. Parting Shots: [The United States can still
fight and win two major wars at the same time]{.underline}, or at least
come near enough to winning that neither Russia nor China would see much
hope in the gamble. The United States can do this because it continues
to maintain the world's most formidable military, and because it stands
at the head of an extremely powerful military alliance. Moreover,
**[Russia and China conveniently pose very different military problems,
allowing the United States to allocate some of its assets to one, and
the rest to the other.]{.underline}**

### AT: INSTEX Scenario

#### EU will stay silent on diplomatic affairs and is too scared to challenge the US

at Keele University. \["EU silence over British seizure of Iranian
tanker is a telling glimpse of post-Brexit future," *the Conversation*,

[It's rare to experience silence in this age of political anger and
loudness, of bombastic tweets, insulting truths and incredible
lies]{.underline}. It's so unfashionable for a politician to not
immediately respond to an event with lightening praise or withering
cynicism, that when we hear nothing, it seems as though something
technical has gone wrong. [To be silent, we are told, is to be
apolitical; to not have an opinion, to be neutral or perhaps simply to
be oblivious.]{.underline} But when it comes to diplomacy, perhaps we
underestimate the impact of silence[. A case in point was the lack of
response from the EU over the UK's strange role in the arrest of an
Iranian supertanker in the Mediterranean Sea in early July]{.underline}.
As the action was taken to uphold EU sanctions, **[the silence was all
the more remarkable.]{.underline}** And it offers a stark forewarning of
the foreign policy tensions the UK will face after it leaves the EU.
Acting upon intelligence that Iranian oil was being shipped to Syria,
the chief minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, requested help from the
Royal Marines to seize the tanker. [Picardo explained that Gibraltar was
simply upholding sanctions laid down by the EU against the Syrian
government by preventing a shipment of 2.1m barrels of light crude oil
to one of its refineries.]{.underline} According to the British, once
refined, it could have fuelled the regime's tanks, armoured cars and
troop carriers that operate alongside Russian forces currently waging
havoc in Syria's Hama region. Despite this, [there was no statement from
the office of the European External Action Service]{.underline}, the EU
body responsible for conducting the bloc's foreign and security policy.
Not a word of gratitude. Not even a nod. **[This was a deliberate and
strategic use of silence.]{.underline}** A noisy affair The Royal
Marines operation on the morning of July 4 to seize the Grace I, which
is owned by Iran but registered in Panama, was itself a fairly noisy
affair. According to the BBC, 30 Royal Marines were deployed together
with local customs and port authority personnel to board the vessel,
which at the time was stuck in heavy maritime traffic in Gibraltar's
territorial waters. [They descended from helicopter gunships onto the
civilian tanker and arrested four shocked Indian crewmen
aboard]{.underline}. Details are scant and it's not clear if the
Gibraltar Port Authority, as per protocol, requested but was denied
permission to board the ship. Predictably enough, the Iranians were
apoplectic and called it an act of piracy, threatening retaliation. The
tanker remains impounded in Gibraltar, its crew released on bail. On
July 14, the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, indicated that he would
facilitate its release if given assurances by Iran that the oil would
not go to Syria. There was one tiny chink in the wall of EU silence that
greeted news that the tanker had been seized. [The European Council
candidate to become the EU's next foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell,
is an outspoken and often truculent Spanish politician]{.underline}.
Unhappy in the first instance about the insensitive use of Gibraltar's
territorial waters, which Spain does not recognise, Borrell's other
preoccupation is European relations with Iran. In his role as Spain's
foreign minister [he told media that the tanker had been seized
following "a request from the United States to the United Kingdom". He
insinuated that the Americans had first offered the intelligence to
Spain.]{.underline} Choices ahead In the wake of the US withdrawal from
the Iran nuclear deal and in the light of the Trump administration's
aggressive sanctions and belligerent language towards Tehran, [the
seizure of a supertanker by an EU member state clearly subverted
European efforts to negotiate with the Iranians]{.underline}. In the
meantime, US national security advisor, John Bolton, brashly tweeted his
delight. Another glaring silence followed from the EU a few days later
when the [Iranians, quite theatrically, dispatched around 30 of its
elite forces to harass an Isle of Man-registered BP supertanker in the
Straits of Hormuz]{.underline}, The British were compelled to send a
warship to the region to protect their commercial fleet, implicitly
joining the American's motley maritime coalition in the Gulf of Arabia
against Iranian threats to the shipping corridor. Once again, other than
passing a cursory warning about the situation, [the EU's foreign and
security body did not comment. The silence conveyed its dissatisfaction
to the US at the way it was manipulating EU sanctions to its own
ends.]{.underline} More pointedly, [the silence was trained upon
Britian's cumbersome attempt to court US military objectives while
claiming to support the delicate diplomacy favoured by the EU towards
Iran.]{.underline} The purpose of the silence was to soak up the
metallic clatter of militarism. [It said to Britain that the time has
come to decide between a hard and a soft path to peace in the Middle
East. The lesson is clear: if post Brexit Britain continues to support a
hawkish US administration, then there is a good chance that Europe's
silence will solidify.]{.underline} This will isolate Britain further
from its neighbours.

#### INSTEX fails

[INSTEX, a plan to circumvent American sanctions on Iran and facilitate
international trade with the Islamic Repu]{.underline}blic, was branded
a damp squib when it became operational at the end of June. The system,
created by Germany, France and Britain, [is so far limited to medicine
and food, which aren\'t even threatened by US penalties.]{.underline} So
far, just a [few million euros have been injected into the
scheme]{.underline}--- a virtual ledger for EU companies to offset
balances, allowing them to exchange goods with Iran without direct
transfers of money. Most commentators think that [even if the mechanism
is scaled up]{.underline} as Brussels intends**[, it will fail to arrest
the huge damage to Iran\'s economy caused by Washington\'s crippling
sanctions.]{.underline}** Sanctions bite hard as Iran marks 40th year
since revolution \"At this stage[, it doesn\'t even get close to
becoming a meaningful mechanism for preserving humanitarian trade
between Iran and Europe]{.underline},\" Ali Vaez, director of the Iran
Project at the International Crisis Group, told DW. Billions more needed
Vaez said [INSTEX would need to facilitate several billions of euros
worth of bilateral trade to force Tehran to return to the terms of the
2015 nuclear deal.]{.underline} Over the past 10 days, [Tehran has twice
increased its enrichment of uranium beyond the limits agreed with world
powers, and the country\'s leaders have demanded the EU\'s new barter
scheme be expanded to cover the trade in oil.]{.underline} While
Washington would almost certainly view the idea of the EU facilitating
oil trade with Iran as an unfriendly act, it appears that Brussels is
listening. On Wednesday, Nathalie Tocci, a special advisor to the EU\'s
foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini, [hinted that Iran\'s oil
could be added to the trading scheme, possibly with Russia\'s
help.]{.underline} INSTEX allows EU companies to trade with Iran without
money changing hands through the SWIFT banking system \"The idea is to
create a triangle between the EU, Russia --- which is also one of the
energy exporters to Europe --- and Iran,\" Tocci told the TV channel
Euronews, citing a proposal by the International Crisis Group think
tank. She said the plan would [\"allow Iran to export energy resources
to Russia, which would then be processed through INSTEX, thus allowing
European products to be exported to Iran.\"]{.underline} Feel Trump\'s
fury [Adding oil to INSTEX would almost certainly provoke a tough
response from US President Donald Trump, who last year pulled his
country out of the Iran nuclear deal. Trump has already threatened
European companies found to be using the scheme with the loss of access
to the US financial system.]{.underline} Already faced with the prospect
of new tariffs on European car exports to the US, EU leaders may well
blink first. \"For the Americans, adding oil \[to INSTEX\] would be a
declaration of European independence,\" Andreas Schweitzer, managing
director of the London-based trade consultancy Arjan Capital, told DW.
Iranian companies counting on the EU He said that Brussels which
normally bows to US pressure would do well to \"maintain European
political and economic independence\" but predicted that **[the plan
would require Europe to \"take the heat\" from what Washington would see
as a major threat to the US dollar-backed financial
system.]{.underline}** On Thursday, the EU said it had added seven more
member states to the 10 originally signed up to INSTEX, and hinted that
non-EU member states would also join the controversial barter scheme.

[The U.S. plans to impose major new sanctions on Iran, signaling it
won't ease pressure despite a diplomatic push by European
leaders]{.underline} to persuade Washington and Tehran to show
restraint. **[The administration has ratcheted up economic pressure on
Tehran since President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear
deal]{.underline}** in May 2018, hoping to drive Iran to accept a
tougher agreement that would end uranium enrichment and curb its
regional ambitions. In recent weeks, [Iran has pushed back. Washington
has blamed Iran for attacks on tankers, while Tehran downed a U.S. drone
and has threatened to violate some terms of the 2015 pact.]{.underline}
In mounting its pressure campaign, the U[**.S. is seeking ultimately to
drive the Islamic Republic's oil exports to zero**. It has more recently
imposed sanctions on Iran's industrial-metals sector and announced major
sanctions on one of the country's biggest petrochemical
companies]{.underline}. **["We've done very massive sanctions. We're
increasing the sanctions now,"]{.underline}** Mr. Trump told NBC over
the weekend. Iran had hoped to spook Mr. Trump and other nations into
easing Washington's financial and economic embargo that has shocked the
nation's economy, U.S. officials and analysts said. Iranian leaders,
those people said, are gambling Mr. Trump is so averse to a direct U.S.
war with Iran that he will slow the pace of new sanctions, soften global
enforcement and compromise on U.S. demands for a nuclear and security
deal. [But Mr. Trump's decision to raise economic pressure further
suggests he believes he can use sanctions to bring Iran to the
negotiating table on U.S. terms without triggering a
conflict.]{.underline} French President Emmanuel Macron and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel are expected at the coming summit of leaders
from Group of 20 nations in Japan to caution Mr. Trump against
intensifying economic pressure, Western diplomats said. [Mr. Trump
reiterated]{.underline} this weekend that he is willing to negotiate
with Iran, [after bucking many of his advisers by canceling a military
strike in Iran on Thursday.]{.underline} "[When the Iranian regime
decides to forgo violence and meet our diplomacy with diplomacy, it
knows how to reach]{.underline} us," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said
on Saturday, denying reports that the U.S. has used Oman to appeal for
talks with Iran. "**[Until then, our diplomatic isolation and
economic-pressure campaign against the regime will
intensify."]{.underline}** Underscoring the point that the U.S. isn't
easing up, American officials confirmed that the [U.S. covertly launched
offensive cyber operations against an Iranian intelligence group's
computer systems on Thursday.]{.underline} John Bolton, Mr. Trump's
national-security adviser and a longtime proponent of regime change in
Iran, said during a visit to Israel that while Mr. Trump had decided to
call off a military strike, the decision shouldn't be interpreted as a
sign of weakness. "**[The administration is not really interested in
negotiations now,"]{.underline}** said Robert Einhorn, a former senior
State Department official who was involved in negotiations with Iranian
officials during the Obama administration. "[It wants to give sanctions
more time to make the Iranians truly desperate, at which point it hopes
the negotiations will be about the terms of surrender."]{.underline} Mr.
Trump and his aides haven't elaborated on what additional sanctions
would look like. One possible channel for ratcheting up the pressure
would be to penalize banks, insurers, traders or any other companies
outside Iran that are still helping the country, a move supporters say
would stifle the remaining flows of cash keeping the country and regime
on life support. Also in the mix are sanctions against Iran's Special
Trade and Finance Instrument, the mirror company to Europe's Instrument
for Supporting Trade Exchanges, a special-purpose vehicle set up to try
to circumvent U.S. sanctions, a person familiar with Treasury
discussions said. [Other sanctions could target economic sectors not
already hit such as consumer- or industrial-goods manufacturing, or
entities that move money or products in and out of Iran, such as trading
houses or shipping concerns.]{.underline} The U.S. Treasury Department,
which is responsible for levying sanctions, declined to comment. The
U.S. faces strong opposition from European nations, Russia and China to
further sanctions, which many analysts said are less about economics
than diplomacy. [European leaders opposed Mr. Trump's decision last year
to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear accord, which allows Iran to enrich
uranium in return for accepting constraints on its nuclear
program.]{.underline} Even with alleged Iranian attacks on foreign
tankers and Iran's threats to expand uranium enrichment, Europe's and
Washington's prescriptions for managing tensions in the region appear to
be starkly different. The clashing strategies are expected to be
discussed at an array of forums this week, especially the G-20 meeting
on Friday and Saturday, which U.S., Saudi, European, Russian and Chinese
leaders will attend. "The G-20 will be an opportunity to try to build
some concrete diplomatic solutions to this situation," Mr. Macron said
on Friday. French officials said he would likely use the days before the
G-20 gathering to test the space for flexibility in the Iranian
position, with a phone call with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani
likely. The European initiatives are based on the assumption that the
Persian Gulf remains a flashpoint, [that additional American sanctions
will backfire and that de-escalatory steps by both sides are urgently
needed to create the space for a potential U.S.-Iran negotiation to head
off a resumption of hostilities.]{.underline} While planning to caution
the Americans about ramping up pressure, France, Britain and Germany
also this weekend issued a formal diplomatic request to Iranian
officials to abide by the limits set on stockpiles of low-enriched
uranium by the 2015 nuclear accord, which Iran is threatening to exceed
on June 27, European diplomats said. Britain's foreign-office minister
for the Middle East, Andrew Murrison, visited Tehran on Sunday for
meetings with senior government officials, following visits last week by
a top French official, the German foreign minister and a senior European
Union diplomat. He reiterated Western accusations that Iran was behind
recent attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman and said Iran must
continue meeting its commitments under the nuclear agreement. However,
he said the U.K. remains determined "to maintain the nuclear deal, which
is in our shared security interests." "The Islamic Republic believes
that such visits and talks should yield acceptable results and practical
steps. Otherwise, visits and statements merely don't work out and the
Islamic Republic will firmly take its preplanned steps" to increase
stockpiles, Abbas Mousavi, spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry, said
on Sunday. European officials have warned there will be consequences if
Iran disregards key commitments under the nuclear deal, but [**Europe's
ability to influence Tehran is limited.** European nations have yet to
develop a robust channel for carrying out trade with Iran while
circumventing U.S. economic sanctions]{.underline}. Should Iran exceed
the limits of the 2015 nuclear accord, the European Union likely will
move cautiously over the summer before deciding whether to snap
sanctions back on Tehran---a move European nations fear would
effectively kill the deal. Tensions between Iran and the U.S. also will
be a key subject at meetings in Europe. On Thursday, Brian Hook, the
U.S. special representative for Iran, will meet in Paris with
representatives of Britain, Germany and France. The next day, Iran is
scheduled to attend a meeting in Vienna to review the nuclear accord
with France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China. At a United Nations
Security Council meeting on Monday, American diplomats plan to present
their evidence that the U.S. Global Hawk drone that was shot down was in
international airspace. Tensions also are likely to be discussed at a
meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers in
Brussels this week. Another set of important meetings will be taking
place in the Middle East, where [expanding the U.S.-led opposition to
Iran will be the main focus.]{.underline} On Sunday, Mr. Pompeo left for
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which he called "two great
allies in the challenge that Iran presents."

**[warned European companies that they have a choice of doing business
with the U.S. or Iran]{.underline}**. Brian Hook, State Department's
special representative on Iran, made the comment to reporters in London
Friday. "[The Europeans are basically trying to placate them by setting
up this trade mechanism]{.underline}. It's basically a barter trade
system. They had high expectations that it could handle such things as
oil, which we saw as unrealistic," said Henry Rome, Eurasia Group
analyst on Iran. "It's mainly designed to allow Iran to buy humanitarian
goods. [**What we saw today was basically the Iranians saying we'll get
back to you. The likely outcome is it's not good enough, and we'll get
additional nuclear escalation."** Oil prices fell right before the U.S.
futures close when the European Union said in a statement that the
remaining signatories to the Iran deal would "intensify"
efforts]{.underline} to reduce the impact of sanctions and normalize
trade with Iran. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled down
96 cents, or 1.6%, at \$58.47 a barrel Friday after trading in a narrow
range for most of the session. Oil traders saw the news as a possible
way for the nuclear deal to be salvaged. "It lessens the tension for
now. If they were going to pull out and create more mischief, it was a
path to another conflict," said John Kilduff of Again Capital. **[The
U.S. has ratcheted up the pressure on Iran by prohibiting any waivers
from the sanctions for Iran's oil customers]{.underline}**. That has
squeezed Iran's ability to export, and now analysts estimate that Iran's
oil exports have fallen below than 500,000 barrels a day, down from more
than 2 million barrels before sanctions. Britain, France and Germany,
the nuclear deal's signatories, set up the trade channel, called INSTEX,
and it will be available to all EU countries. China and Russia also
still remain parties to the nuclear the deal. [The U.S. left the deal
because it viewed it as one-sided.]{.underline} Iran has set a July 7
deadline by which it expects the other parties to grant it some relief
from the U.S. sanctions. "**[They are threatening various steps,
announcing deadlines, removing deadlines, changing them, making new
threats, like they are dropping from the proliferation treaty. They're
really trying to light a fire under the Europeans to see what the
maximum is they are going to get,"]{.underline}** said Rome. "They're
going to get mainly humanitarian or non-sanctioned goods. **[What the
Iranians really want, and the whole ball game for them, is oil, and the
Europeans cannot simply facilitate that. The Iranians are guaranteed to
be disappointed by the outcome here," he said.]{.underline}**

### AT: Interventions Bad

#### US interventions have been historically peaceful and overwhelmingly positive for global security

Fellow with the Project on International Order and Strategy in the

and Our Imperiled World," *Alfred A. Knopf*, 9-18-2018, ISBN:

[The first two administrations of the post--Cold War era both believed
that the United States still bore "international
responsibilities."]{.underline} Although [George H. W. Bush and Bill
Clinton]{.underline} could not have been more different in many ways,
including the fact that one was a Republican and the other a Democrat,
they [shared the belief that the United States still had to be the
primary defender of a liberal world order---the "new world
order]{.underline}," Bush called it. The United States was still the
"indispensable nation," to use Clinton's famous phrase, which only
echoed the sentiments of Dean Acheson decades before, when he had
declared the United States the "locomotive at the head of mankind."113
As former Clinton official Stephen Sestanovich observes, "The Clinton
administration's steady revival of an activist U.S. role was based on
policy premises that were identical to those on which the policy makers
of the Truman administration began to wage the Cold War."114 But since
there was no Cold War to fight, it would be more accurate to say that
both Bush and Clinton based their approach on the same principles as the
strategy chosen before the onset of the Cold War in 1946. [The first
test of the new era came when Saddam Hussein's Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990]{.underline}. Bush's response was very much in keeping with the
original grand strategy dating back to World War II. [Failure to respond
forcefully would set "a terrible precedent,"]{.underline} Bush's adviser
Brent Scowcroft believed, one [that would only "accelerate violent
centrifugal tendencies within the emerging 'post--Cold War'
era."]{.underline}115 Like Truman in Korea in 1950, Bush saw parallels
with the 1930s---"I wanted no appeasement," he later wrote.116 Like
Roosevelt in 1940, he argued that "a world in which brutality and
lawlessness" were "allowed to go unchecked" wasn't the kind of world
Americans were going to want to live in. [Such thinking also informed
Bush's decisions to intervene in Panama and Somalia, and Clinton's
decisions to intervene in Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, and to launch an air
and missile campaign against Iraq.]{.underline} When Bush sent thirty
thousand troops to remove the corrupt Panamanian dictator Manuel
Noriega, it was, as George Will wrote approvingly at the time, to
fulfill "the rights and responsibilities that come with the possession
of great power."117 [After the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, Bosnia,
Clinton officials argued that "Serb aggression" tore at "the very fabric
of the West]{.underline}."118 **[These minor interventions were all
viewed by American officials as part of managing and defending the world
order]{.underline}**, although they also protected specific American
interests: [Bush reversed Iraq's aggression against Kuwait and kept
control of the vast oil reserves of the Persian Gulf out of the hands of
a serial aggressor.]{.underline} [He removed a Panamanian dictator
convicted of running a drug supply operation in the United States.
Clinton restored a democratically elected Caribbean leader, thereby
staunching the flow of tens of thousands of Haitian refugees to American
shores.]{.underline} [He twice acted to prevent genocide in the
Balkans]{.underline}, after years of allied calls for help, and partly
as a way of [reaffirming America's commitment to European
security]{.underline}. [The only purely humanitarian intervention was in
Somalia]{.underline}. That operation would ultimately be deemed a
failure because of the tragic loss of eighteen American soldiers during
a raid in Mogadishu on Clinton's watch. Forgotten, however, was that the
[**American intervention**,]{.underline} instigated largely under the
direction of General Colin Powell**[, saved over 200,000 Somali
lives]{.underline}**. **[This was not an "era of indiscriminate
interventions" undertaken in a mood of "giddy optimism]{.underline}**,"
as some would later assert.119 None of these actions was taken without
long reflection and tortured debate. [Most were taken reluctantly, not
eagerly]{.underline}. The United States went four years without
addressing the crisis and the killings in the Balkans until Clinton,
with his back against the wall, finally intervened to prevent a new
round of ethnic cleansing and to force a diplomatic settlement. **[And
most of these interventions were successful, by any reasonable measure
of success, and were carried out with minimal cost by historical
standards.]{.underline}** There were [no American combat losses at all
in the Clinton administration's three interventions in Haiti, Bosnia,
and Kosovo. There were remarkably few even in the 1991 Gulf
War]{.underline}, though experts had predicted thousands of American
soldiers would die. Altogether[, fewer Americans died in combat in the
entire decade of the 1990s than in every single month of the Vietnam War
from 1966 to 1972. During]{.underline} the twelve years of [Bush and
Clinton]{.underline}, meanwhile, [defense spending fell by 30
percent;]{.underline} the number of [active duty military personnel
dropped from over two million to 1.3 million]{.underline}; and the
number of [troops deployed overseas went from 453,000 to
210,000.]{.underline}120 These were the lowest numbers since the 1930s.
[Among the supposed "follies" of American foreign policy in those
years]{.underline}---more evidence, allegedly, of American hubris and
overreach---[was the enlargement of]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline}.
According to critics at the time and later, the admission of Poland and
other Central and Eastern European nations into NATO poisoned relations
with Russia, prevented any accommodation, and gave rise in Russia to
fears that its security was imperiled. We will turn in a moment to
whether Russian anxieties could ever have been allayed, no matter how
cautious and restrained American policies had been, but at the time [the
decision to bring the nations of Central and Eastern Europe into NATO
was a response to their fears and anxieties. Given the long and
consistent history of Russian intervention and imperial
domination]{.underline} in Central and Eastern Europe, and especially
the recent experience of the Cold War, the [countries in that
traditional Russian sphere of interest had reason for prudent
concern]{.underline}. From very early on, **[Russia's neighbors worried
that their newly won liberation from Soviet control might not
last]{.underline}**. As German sociologist Ralf Dahrendorf put it at the
time, even Gorbachev's call for a "common European home" was not
entirely comforting. There was "something suspicious about yesterday's
hegemonic power wishing to set up house with those whom it occupied and
held under its tutelage for so long."121 German chancellor Helmut Kohl
pushed German unification through as fast as he did in 1991 in part
because he worried that Russia was just one coup away from reversing
course.122 By the mid-1990s, [Eastern and Central Europeans had become
so desperate to join NATO that even the more hesitant Western European
powers like France came around to supporting the admission of at least
some of them.]{.underline} Whatever the effect on the Russians may have
been, **[the enlargement of NATO brought stability, democracy, and
prosperity to nations in Eastern and Central Europe that had rarely
enjoyed any of those things]{.underline}**. [A Europe "whole and free"
represented another sharp break from history]{.underline} and prevented
that region from either descending into turmoil or becoming, once again,
victim of a struggle between East and West. [The benefits to world peace
and stability were significant]{.underline}, and the costs to the United
States were comparatively minor.

with today's most pressing challenges,]{.underline} including nontariff

[sanctions is growing, as is concern over]{.underline} the country's

little relevance to most of the world's conflicts]{.underline}, and
international arrangements have failed more broadly to contend with the
challenges associated with globalization. The composition of [the

itself on the record as against genocide and has [asserted a right to

states to have nuclear weapons, but]{.underline} there are now
[nine]{.underline} that [do]{.underline} (and many others that could
follow suit if they chose to). [The EU,]{.underline} by far the most
significant regional arrangement, [is struggling with Brexit and
disputes over migration]{.underline} and sovereignty. And around the
world, countries are increasingly resisting U.S. primacy. Why is all
this happening? It is instructive to look back to the gradual demise of
the Concert of Europe. **[Today's world order has struggled to cope with
power shifts]{.underline}**: [China's rise,]{.underline} the appearance
of several medium powers ([Iran and North Korea]{.underline}, in
particular) [that reject]{.underline} important aspects of [the order,
and the emergence of nonstate actors]{.underline} (from drug cartels to
terrorist networks) that can pose a serious threat to order within and
between states. The technological and political context has changed in
important ways, too. [Globalization has had destabilizing effects,
ranging from climate change to the spread of technology]{.underline}
into far more hands than ever before, including a range of groups and
people intent on disrupting the order. [Nationalism and populism have
surged]{.underline}---the result of greater inequality within countries,
the dislocation associated with the 2008 financial crisis, job losses
caused by trade and technology, increased flows of migrants and
refugees, and the power of social media to spread hate. Meanwhile,
effective statecraft is conspicuously lacking. [Institutions have failed
to adapt.]{.underline} No one today would design a UN Security Council
that looked like the current one; yet [real reform is impossible, since
those who would lose influence block any changes. Efforts to build
effective frameworks to deal with]{.underline} the
[challenges]{.underline} of globalization, [including climate change and
cyberattacks, have come up short]{.underline}. [Mistakes within the
EU]{.underline}---namely, the decisions to establish a common currency
without creating a common fiscal policy or a banking union and to permit
nearly unlimited immigration to Germany---[have created a powerful
backlash against existing governments]{.underline}, [open borders, and
the EU itself]{.underline}. **[The United States]{.underline}**, for its
part, **[has committed costly overreach in trying to remake
Afghanistan]{.underline}**, invading **[Iraq, and]{.underline}**
pursuing regime change in **[Libya]{.underline}**. But it has also taken
a step back from maintaining global order and in certain cases has been
guilty of costly underreach. In most instances, U.S. reluctance to act
has come not over core issues but over peripheral ones that leaders
wrote off as not worth the costs involved, such as the strife in Syria,
where the United States failed to respond meaningfully when Syria first
used chemical weapons or to do more to help anti-regime groups. [This
**reluctance has increased others' propensity to disregard U.S. concerns
and act independently**]{.underline}. [The Saudi-led military
intervention in Yemen is a case in point]{.underline}. [Russian actions
in Syria and Ukraine should also be seen in this light;]{.underline} it
is interesting that Crimea marked the effective end of the Concert of
Europe and signaled a dramatic setback in the current order. **[Doubts

In 2018, [we moved closer to the multipolar]{.underline} world that
looks set to replace the bipolar US-Russian geopolitical regime that
emerged from the Cold War. [China's ascent as a serious economic and
geostrategic rival]{.underline} for the US, and its growing
assertiveness with programs like \"One Belt, One Road\" or \"Made in
China 2025\", [has strengthened its influence]{.underline} on the world
stage. [The possibility that the US might withdraw from its nuclear arms
treaty]{.underline} with Russia (China was not a signatory and therefore
does not face the same limits) is a further testimony to the shifting
geopolitics. This also holds true for [historical
alliances]{.underline}. Take the US and Europe, for example, which
admittedly already constituted two close but distinct economic and
strategic poles[. Trade and defence issues have recently revealed
additional cracks in this partnership]{.underline}, evidenced by their
diverging positions on the Iran nuclear deal and sanctions.
[**Struggling Western middle class** Today's multipolar world mirrors
the vast development of emerging markets]{.underline}, fuelled by
supportive demographics and the benefits that economic globalization
brings. At the same time, **[it also reflects the relative decline of
the middle class in developed markets.]{.underline}** Since the 2008
financial crisis, [inequalities have grown, not so much across as within
countries, especially in developed countries]{.underline}. The economic
policy mix of [fiscal austerity and very loose monetary
policy]{.underline}, which most developed economies adopted to respond
to the financial crisis, [proved particularly detrimental to the Western
middle class.]{.underline} According to a 2015 report by the Pew
Research Center, 61% of US adults lived in middle-income households in
1971, with the remaining 39% living in upper and lower-income
households. In 2015, the two groups were equal at 50% each. Encroaching
protectionism [Tough labour market conditions, marked by persistently
high unemployment and stagnating incomes, followed the financial crisis.
These were exacerbated by hyper-globalization and disruptive
technologies**. This combination left many middle-class households with
the sense of having lost out the most in the ensuing
years.**]{.underline} Their growing frustration led voters in the US,
along with those in many European countries, to drive a political shift
away from the establishment to populist governments with a new mandate
to restore Western middle-class prosperity and security. As a result,
economic policy in [the West has become tilted toward more fiscal policy
and protectionism.]{.underline} The newly elected governments' key
objective is to [support their domestic economy through job creation and
wage increases at home, and potential regulation or taxation of certain
sectors or industries]{.underline}. In developed markets, for example,
[this takes the form of more restrictions for foreign companies seeking
access to domestic markets and/or greater support for domestic companies
to raise their competitiveness, for instance via corporate tax
cuts.]{.underline} Beyond the US, where the Trump administration has
taken action on both of these fronts, even countries like Germany, which
were traditionally open to free trade, have started to prevent
acquisitions by foreign companies when strategic knowhow is involved.
The blocked acquisition of Leifeld Metal Spinning AG by Yantai Taihai
Group is a case in point. As for emerging markets, there is increased
awareness that they are the consumer markets of the future due to the
sheer size of their population. Governmental growth policy in these
markets is moving to a consumer and services-led model, with growing
median private wealth predominantly benefiting domestic companies.
[Should the recent trade truce between China and the US shift away from
tariffs and other barriers as key policy tools, corporate and private
tax competition could become the new battleground.]{.underline} National
champions take on new role Against this backdrop, national champions and
brands take on an entirely new role. [National champions]{.underline}
are companies in large countries with a sizeable domestic workforce in
strategic sectors. They have an inherent multiplier effect that
politicians can leverage, for instance to create domestic jobs or
increase wages. Furthermore, they [have a large workforce that could
shield them from regulation, making protectionism more likely if it
would prove favourable for them]{.underline}. They often create
so-called national brands -- an extension of the national champions
themselves. [These brands are typically shielded against protectionist
measures thanks to their diversified, loyal and less price-sensitive
customer base, and their global reach. These brands also benefit from
government lobbying]{.underline}, as Airbus did during French President
Emmanuel Macron's visit to China in January 2018, during which the
Chinese government signalled an interest in buying 184 Airbus jets.

DTS

[Recent events, however, should give progressives pause about what a
multipolar world means]{.underline}. Certainly, belief that the United
States would act unilaterally, unwisely, and unfairly was sustenance to
multipolarity's cheerleaders at home and abroad. "[Calling for a
'multipolar world' \[became\] a euphemism for opposing the Iraq
war]{.underline}," Foreign Policy's Elizabeth Dickinson observed. While
President George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq is widely disparaged today
both in the United States and international circles today, only the
passage of time will---like Harry S. Truman's intervention in
Korea---determine its place in history. [However, as China, Russia,
Iran, and Turkey challenge the post--World War II international order
and seek regional dominance, their behavior reflects the reality of what
a multipolar world truly means.]{.underline} What would a multipolar
world look like? Consider, for example, [China's abduction of Meng
Hongwei, the head of Interpol. Can]{.underline} international and
[multilateral organizations work if their leaders must
subordinate]{.underline} themselves [**to the increasingly hardline
Chinese Communist Party**? Russia's protection of Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[signals the end of a post--World War I consensus.]{.underline} Critics
can castigate the United States for upwards of two hundred thousand
Iraqi deaths, which occurred as the result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq
and its aftermath, but they often ignore the fact that [America was not
to blame for most of these deaths]{.underline}. Instead, [they were a
result of suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks sponsored by
Tehran and others who too often avoid progressive
accountability]{.underline} for their choices. Put another way,
**[American training and tactics seek to minimize civilian casualties in
all phases of conflict.]{.underline}** [Russia, however, has no such
qualms: ask the Chechens]{.underline}. Nor should America's history in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries provide an excuse to ignore
those, like [China]{.underline}, who today [would incarcerate a million
citizens in re-education camps solely because of their ethnicity or
religion.]{.underline} Turkish president Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan has been
forthright in his desire to reshape the post--World War II
international]{.underline} order. "Rather than justice, the existing
global order is producing chaos, injustice and despair," he argued in
September 2018. But it is [Erdoğan]{.underline} who has [waged ethnic
cleansing against Syrian Kurds]{.underline}, a campaign he may soon
expand, [and Erdoğan defended genocide in the Sudan and opened the
floodgates for foreign fighters into the Islamic State.]{.underline}
It's one thing to criticize or second-guess U.S. policy; that is the
domain of democratic debate in Congress and during presidential
campaigns and in dueling op-eds in a free press, but [it is nonsensical
to suggest that any alternate pole---Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, or
Ankara---would make the world a more peaceful place or better respect
the evolving international human-rights regime.]{.underline} The one
thing [revisionist states]{.underline} have in common is that they
[tolerate neither debate nor dissonance.]{.underline} [That is a lesson
Uighurs, Ukrainians, and Kurds have discovered, as have Meng Hongwei and
Turkey's imprisoned journalists]{.underline}. It is time American and
European progressives recognize it as well, for the stakes are far
greater than simply American power.

### Fails -- War

#### Multipolarity fails & ensures [nuclear conflict]{.underline}

Jinnah Women's University, "Emergence Of Multipolarity: What It Holds
For World Peace?" 5/11/2019,
<https://www.eurasiareview.com/11052019-emergence-of-multipolarity-what-it-holds-for-world-peace-oped/>,
sg)

Polarity can be defined as the number of powerful or dominant states in
global or regional systems. It is the method of distribution of power in
international system. The world has remained unipolar since the end of
the Cold War in 1991, however, [it is believed that it can not remain
unipolar for long]{.underline}. [There are other powers
emerging]{.underline} in the international arena [that are challenging
US hegemony.]{.underline} We can consider the post World War II system
as entering the third phase of polarity. The Cold War period (1947-1991)
was characterized as bipolarity with US on one side and Soviet Union on
the other. However, the fall of Soviet Union in 1991 caused the
emergence of unipolarity, with US as the sole power center, also
referred to as Pax Americana. But, entering third phase does not mean
that US has lost its status of superpower, though there are other powers
emerging on the scene, playing an essential role in US declining
influence. [Powers like Russia and China are seeking to increase their
influence on a global scale, while other states are trying to emphasize
their influence regionally]{.underline}. Fareed Zakaria also argued that
[we are living in an era of a third great power shift entering into a
multipolar world]{.underline}. He further argues that this great power
shift is caused by what is called the "rise of the rest". The rise of
the rest of the rest is the phrase used for the powers outside of the
West particularly the BRICS, which constitutes for 30 percent of the
global territory and 45 percent of global population. It consisted of 15
percent of global economy and 42 percent of global currency reserves, at
the time when it was formed in 2005. But [what does this shift mean for
the world peace? Will it bring stability or instability]{.underline}?
Whether the emerging multipolar world will be conflictual or
cooperative? It is seen from the historical and documented evidence that
multipolarity is an inherently unstable system. [As]{.underline} the
[other states are increasing their influence, it is creating unrest in
the US, which in turn is trying to counter this rise in order to
maintain its hegemony]{.underline}. [US considers China's "peaceful"
rise as the most crucial threat to]{.underline} its
[unipolarity]{.underline}. China's policy is rooted in the belief of
peacefully annexing other states through huge economic influence e.g..
the Belt and Road Initiative, as the trend of militarily occupying the
states territory has been over. China was the world's second largest
economy in the world in 2010, measured in purchasing power (⅔ of the
number of US). It is estimated that it could reach to the level of US
economy by 2027. This will then lead towards the rise of a bi-multipolar
world, with US and China being the major powers, however there are other
powers as well who are trying to get to the status of hegemon e.g.
India, Brazil, and maybe EU. This will then lead towards multipolarity,
a [multipolarity]{.underline} that [won't be as peaceful as it
seems.]{.underline} There are numerous reasons for why we consider that
**[multipolarity is inherently unstable]{.underline}**. In the
contemporary world, states are increasingly interested in making
alliances or coalitions, but [even in]{.underline} those [alliances
there individual national interests prevail over their collective
interests]{.underline}. States often go against their alliances'
decisions or viewpoints if they contradict with their own interests. In
short, [states pursue their own national interests instead of the
interests of all, leading towards]{.underline} misunderstandings and
mismanagement, and consequently the emergence of [conflict]{.underline}.
Incidents like 9/11 attacks and the policies adopted in their aftermath
shows that even the US is not able to handle each and every situation on
its own, instead it would have to incorporate other states in dealing
with them. Hence, [alliances are an important phenomena of the emerging
multipolar system, and occurrence of conflict in those alliances is
inevitable]{.underline}. Furthermore, in the contemporary world, **[we
can not ignore the impacts of the presence of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. There are [some]{.underline} who [believe that
nuclear weapons lead towards stability due to]{.underline} their
capability of "[deterrence]{.underline}". But, it is more acceptable and
logical to believe that **[nuclear weapons are the source of insecurity
in especially the multipolar system, where more than one state possess
such lethal weapons]{.underline}**. Why? Because the [neorealism's
concept of "security dilemma" demonstrate that the possession of nuclear
weapons by one state,]{.underline} even for the purpose of its own
security, [create insecurity in the other states which in turn seek
their own nuclear weapons]{.underline}, as evidenced by the historical
events. The current system of distribution not only enables the great
powers, but also the middle and small powers to develop capabilities
that could potentially threaten the world peace and security. So, [in
this view, the world would be more conflictual or unstable as it would
be facing two challenges simultaneously; a multipolar world as well as
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The [Power Transition Theory]{.underline}
also advocates this view. It [considers the presence of a
hegemon]{.underline}, with [dictating the rules and regulations of the
world, as a guarantee to peace]{.underline}. Whereas, [on the contrary,
many states with equal power to alter the system proves hazardous
to]{.underline} the [international peace]{.underline}, as [there would
be more states competing for hegemony]{.underline} and ruling the world
according to their own views. Hence, power transition theory promotes
the view that **[a multipolar world will indeed be conflictual one, with
multiple states struggling and competing to ensure their own
superiority]{.underline}**. Multipolar world with more than two power
centers would prove unstable because **[there are increasing
probabilities of the breakout of conflict or war between the potential
candidates of the world's hegemon.]{.underline}**

### Transition Wars

#### Transition to multipolarity causes war -- spheres of influence do not satisfy revisionist powers & make conflict inevitable, producing World War III -- only American hard power provides global stability

That shift may come too late. It was in the 1920s, not the 1930s, that
the democratic powers made the most important and ultimately fatal
decisions. Americans' disillusionment after World War I led them to
reject playing a strategic role in preserving the peace in Europe and
Asia, even though America was the only nation powerful enough to play
that role. The withdrawal of the United States helped undermine the will
of Britain and France and encouraged Germany in Europe and Japan in Asia
to take increasingly aggressive actions to achieve regional dominance.
Most Americans were convinced that nothing that happened in Europe or
Asia could affect their security. It took World War II to convince them
that was a mistake. The "return to normalcy" of the 1920 election seemed
safe and innocent at the time, but the essentially selfish policies
pursued by the world's strongest power in the following decade helped
set the stage for the calamities of the 1930s. By the time the crises
began to erupt, it was already too late to avoid paying the high price
of global conflict. In such times, [it has always been tempting to
believe that geopolitical competition can be solved through efforts at
cooperation and accommodation]{.underline}. [The idea]{.underline},
recently proposed by Niall Ferguson, [that the world can be ruled
jointly by the United States, Russia, and China]{.underline} is not a
new one. Such condominiums [have been proposed]{.underline} and
attempted [in every era when the dominant power]{.underline} or powers
in the international system [sought to fend off challenges
from]{.underline} the [dissatisfied revisionist powers]{.underline}. It
has rarely worked. **[Revisionist great powers are not easy to
satisfy]{.underline}** **[short of complete capitulation]{.underline}**.
**[Their sphere of influence is never quite large enough to satisfy
their pride or their expanding need for security]{.underline}**. In
fact, [their]{.underline} very [expansion creates
insecurity]{.underline}, [by frightening neighbors and leading them to
band together against the rising power]{.underline}. The satiated power
that Otto von Bismarck spoke of is rare. The German leaders who
succeeded him were not satisfied even with being the strongest power in
Europe. In their efforts to grow still stronger, [they
produce]{.underline}d [coalitions against them, making their fear of
"encirclement" a self-fulfilling prophecy.]{.underline} BEIJING, CHINA -

Give 'em an inch, they'll take a mile This is a common trait of [rising
powers]{.underline} --- their actions [produce the very insecurity they
claim to want to redress.]{.underline} They harbor grievances against
the existing order (both Germany and Japan considered themselves the
"have-not" nations), but [their grievances cannot be satisfied so long
as the existing order remains in place]{.underline}. Marginal concession
is not enough, but the powers upholding the existing order will not make
more than marginal concessions unless they are compelled to by superior
strength. Japan, the aggrieved "have-not" nation of the 1930s, did not
satisfy itself by taking Manchuria in 1931. Germany, the aggrieved
victim of Versailles, did not satisfy itself by bringing the Germans of
the Sudetenland back into the fold. They demanded much more, and they
could not persuade the democratic powers to give them what they wanted
without resorting to war. **[Granting the revisionist powers spheres of
influence is not a recipe for peace and tranquility but rather an
invitation to inevitable conflict]{.underline}**. Granting the
revisionist powers spheres of influence is not a recipe for peace and
tranquility but rather an invitation to inevitable conflict.
[Russia's]{.underline} historical [sphere of influence]{.underline} does
not end in Ukraine. It [begins in Ukraine. It extends to the Baltic
States, to the Balkans, and to the heart of Central Europe]{.underline}.
And [within Russia's]{.underline} traditional [sphere of
influence]{.underline}, **[other nations do not enjoy autonomy or even
sovereignty]{.underline}**. There was no independent Poland under the
Russian Empire nor under the Soviet Union. [For China to gain its
desired sphere of influence]{.underline} in East Asia [will mean that,
when it chooses, it can close the region off to the United
States]{.underline} --- not only militarily but politically and
economically, too. China will, of course, inevitably exercise great sway
in its own region, as will Russia. [The United States cannot and should
not prevent China from being an economic powerhouse. Nor should it wish
for the collapse of Russia]{.underline}. **[The United States should
even welcome competition]{.underline}** of a certain kind. Great powers
compete across multiple planes --- economic, ideological, and political,
as well as military. Competition in most spheres is necessary and even
healthy. [Within the liberal order, China can compete economically and
successfully with the United States]{.underline}; [Russia can thrive in
the international economic order]{.underline} upheld by the democratic
system, even if it is not itself democratic. **[But military and
strategic competition is different.]{.underline}** The security
situation undergirds everything else. It remains true today as it has
since World War II that **[only the United States has the capacity and
the unique geographical advantages to provide global security and
relative stability]{.underline}**. There is no stable balance of power
in Europe or Asia without the United States. And while we can talk about
["soft power" and "smart power,"]{.underline} they have been and [always
will be of limited value when confronting raw military
power.]{.underline} Despite all of the loose talk of American decline,
[it is in the military realm where U.S. advantages remain
clearest]{.underline}. Even in other great powers' backyards, the United
States retains the capacity, along with its powerful allies, to deter
challenges to the security order. But **[without a U.S. willingness to
maintain the balance in far-flung regions of the world]{.underline}**,
[the system will buckle under]{.underline} the [unrestrained military
competition]{.underline} [of regional powers]{.underline}. Part of that
willingness entails defense spending commensurate with America's
continuing global role. **[For the United States to accept a return to
spheres of influence]{.underline}** would not calm the international
waters. It **[would merely return the world to]{.underline}** the
condition it was in at the end of the 19th century, with **[competing
great powers clashing over inevitably intersecting and overlapping
spheres]{.underline}**. **[These unsettled, disordered conditions
produced the fertile ground for the two destructive world
wars]{.underline}** of the first half of the 20th century. The collapse
of the British-dominated world order on the oceans, the disruption of
the uneasy balance of power on the European continent as a powerful
unified Germany took shape, and the rise of Japanese power in East Asia
all contributed to [a highly competitive international environment in
which dissatisfied great powers took the opportunity to pursue their
ambitions in the absence of any power or group of powers to unite in
checking them]{.underline}. [The result]{.underline} [was]{.underline}
an **[unprecedented global calamity and death on an epic
scale]{.underline}**. It has been the great accomplishment of the
U.S.-led world order in the 70 years since the end of World War II that
this kind of competition has been held in check and great power
conflicts have been avoided. [It will be more than a shame if Americans
were to destroy what they created]{.underline} --- [and not because it
was no longer possible to sustain but simply because they chose to stop
trying.]{.underline}

#### Transition to a multipolar world creates massive transition wars -- rising nationalism, ease of nuclear proliferation

[Polarity can be defined as the number of powerful or dominant states in
global or regional systems.]{.underline} It is the method of
distribution of power in international system. The world has remained
unipolar since the end of the Cold War in 1991, however, it is believed
that it can not remain unipolar for long. [There are other powers
emerging in the international arena that are challenging US
hegemony.]{.underline} We can consider the post World War II system as
entering the third phase of polarity. The Cold War period (1947-1991)
was characterized as bipolarity with US on one side and Soviet Union on
the other. **[However, the fall of Soviet Union in 1991 caused the
emergence of unipolarity, with US as the sole power center, also
referred to as Pax Americana.]{.underline}** But, entering third phase
does not mean that US has lost its status of superpower, though [there
are other powers emerging on the scene, playing an essential role in US
declining influence]{.underline}. [Powers like Russia and China are
seeking to increase their influence on a global scale]{.underline},
**[while other states are trying to emphasize their influence
regionally]{.underline}**. Fareed Zakaria also argued that we are living
in an era of a third great power shift entering into a multipolar world.
He further argues that [this great power shift is caused by what is
called the "rise of the rest".]{.underline} The rise of the rest of the
rest is the phrase used for the powers outside of the West particularly
the BRICS, which constitutes for 30 percent of the global territory and
45 percent of global population[. It consisted of 15 percent of global
economy and 42 percent of global currency reserves, at the time when it
was formed in 2005.]{.underline} But what does this shift mean for the
world peace? Will it bring stability or instability? Whether the
emerging multipolar world will be conflictual or cooperative[? It is
seen from the historical and documented evidence that **multipolarity is
an inherently unstable system**.]{.underline} As the other states are
increasing their influence, [it is creating unrest in the US, which in
turn is trying to counter this rise in order to maintain its
hegemony.]{.underline} US considers China's "peaceful" rise as the most
crucial threat to its unipolarity. [China's policy is rooted in the
belief of peacefully annexing other states through huge economic
influence e.g.. the Belt and Road Initiative, as the trend of militarily
occupying the states territory has been over]{.underline}. China was the
world's second largest economy in the world in 2010, measured in
purchasing power (⅔ of the number of US). It is estimated that it could
reach to the level of US economy by 2027. This will then lead towards
the rise of a bi-multipolar world, with US and China being the major
powers, [however there are other powers as well who are trying to get to
the status of hegemon e.g. India, Brazil, and maybe EU.]{.underline}
This will then lead towards multipolarity, a **[multipolarity that won't
be as peaceful as it seems.]{.underline}** There are numerous reasons
for why we consider that multipolarity is inherently unstable. In the
contemporary world, states are increasingly interested in making
alliances or coalitions, but **[even in those alliances there individual
national interests prevail over their collective
interests]{.underline}**. [States often go against their alliances'
decisions or viewpoints if they contradict with their own
interests.]{.underline} In short, [states pursue their own national
interests instead of the interests of all]{.underline}, leading towards
misunderstandings and mismanagement, and consequently the emergence of
conflict. [Incidents like 9/11 attacks and the policies adopted in their
aftermath shows that even the US is not able to handle each and every
situation on its own]{.underline}, instead it would have to incorporate
other states in dealing with them. [Hence, alliances are an important
phenomenon of the emerging multipolar system, and **occurrence of
conflict in those alliances is inevitable.**]{.underline} Furthermore,
in the contemporary world, [we can not ignore the impacts of the
presence of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. There are some who believe
that nuclear weapons lead towards stability due to their capability of
"deterrence". **[But, it is more acceptable and logical to believe that
nuclear weapons are the source of insecurity in especially the
multipolar system]{.underline}**, where more than one state possess such
lethal weapons. Why? Because the [neorealism's concept of "security
dilemma" demonstrate that the possession of nuclear weapons by one
state, even for the purpose of its own security, create insecurity in
the other states which in turn seek their own nuclear weapons, as
evidenced by the historical events. The current system of distribution
not only enables the great powers**, but also the middle and small
powers to develop capabilities that could potentially threaten the world
peace and security**]{.underline}. So, in this view, [the world would be
more conflictual or unstable as it would be facing two challenges
simultaneously]{.underline}; a multipolar world as well as nuclear
weapons. The Power Transition Theory also advocates this view. [It
considers the presence of a hegemon, with dictating the rules and
regulations of the world, as a guarantee to peace.]{.underline} Whereas,
on the contrary, **[many states with equal power to alter the system
proves hazardous to the international peace, as there would be more
states competing for hegemony and ruling the world according to their
own views.]{.underline}** Hence, power transition theory promotes the
view that [**a multipolar world will indeed be conflictual one,** with
multiple states struggling and competing to ensure their own
superiority. Multipolar world with more than two power]{.underline}
[centers would prove unstable because there are increasing probabilities
of the breakout of conflict or war]{.underline} between the potential
candidates of the world's hegemon. However, discussing multipolarity
over here does not mean that a multipolar world has emerged, and US
unipolarity has diminished. US is still the world's leading power,
however, the problem is that it would not be able to maintain this
position for long. As others powers are consistently pursuing a position
of countering US hegemony. US influence is declining, which it would
make sure to maintain at any cost. [This then has the propensity to lead
towards a number of conflicts, as we can still see in the US role in
Asia and Middle East.]{.underline}

#### A rising China will challenge the liberal world order -- causes transition war absent US military primacy

With the U.S. military distracted and stretched thin by more than a
decade of counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, [China
has launched an ambitious military modernization that will be able to
challenge the US for dominance in "all domains of conflict -- ground,
air, sea, space, cyberspace and electromagnetic --]{.underline}
throughout the Indo-Pacific" by 2035, according to the think tank RAND.
It has built an expanded submarine fleet, a modernized nuclear arsenal,
the first Chinese aircraft carrier, a greatly expanded array of advanced
anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, and a modern command-and-control
and surveillance network. Today, [China has the world's largest navy at
approximately 350 ships, the largest coast guard, and a "maritime
militia" of fishing boats who answer directly to the PLA]{.underline}
Navy and routinely harass shipping in sensitive areas in the East and
South China Seas. The seven newly militarized manmade islands are also
major building blocks in China's strategy to dominate its near seas,
providing permanent forward basing for weapons that can threaten ships
and aircraft traffic. Graphic courtesy Sen. Dan Sullivan Acting as
unsinkable aircraft carriers, "[the manmade islands provide a persistent
surveillance and weapons platform that could help China establish a
regional air defense system, which would be]{.underline} a
[key]{.underline} element [in controlling the South China
Sea]{.underline}," said Bryan Clark, a former special assistant to the
Chief of Naval Operations who's now with the thinktank CSBA. With its
large navy and coast guard working in conjunction with a provocative
"maritime militia," he noted, [China already has "escalation
dominance]{.underline}" --- [the ability to answer any escalation by
other powers with a greater escalation of its own]{.underline} --- and
thus de facto control of the South China Sea by constantly operating
just below a threshold that might provoke a U.S. military response.
"China's frequent harassment of U.S. Navy ships and the ships of other
navies, and its wide array of forces, gives it the tools to climb up or
down the escalation ladder as circumstances dictate," said Clark. [The
goal is to increase the costs of U.S. operations in the region, he said,
in hopes that the U.S. Navy will reduce its activities over
time.]{.underline} "The Chinese want to habituate the idea that if you
operate in the South China Sea without their approval you are inviting
harassment and assuming increasing risk. They want that to be the new
normal." U.S. military officials recognize China's military
modernization and operations in the South China Sea as pillars in an
"anti-access, aerial denial" (A2/AD) strategy designed to impede U.S.
operations in the Indo-Pacific, and call into question the U.S. military
commitment to regional allies. They claim to have no intention of
abandoning "freedom of navigation" operations in international waters
despite the persistent threats and harassment. "We have made clear to
our Asian allies our continued support for a rules-based international
order that requires the United States to uphold the principle of freedom
of navigation by operating wherever international law allows," General
Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Breaking
Defense in an exclusive interview in Asia last year. "It's also
indisputable that China has militarized those artificial islands after
promising not to do so in 2015, which tells me that they are trying to
push the U.S. military further out to sea in order to prevent us from
having free access to the region to meet our military commitments to
allies. That's a classic A2/AD strategy. If you combine that with
China's pursuit of long-range anti-ship cruise missiles and rocket
systems, it's clear they are attempting to deny the United States the
ability to operate freely in the region." CSBA graphic Chinese weapons
ranges (CSBA graphic) A Colder Peace or Thucydides' Trap? The biggest
shift in U.S. strategy towards China came with January's release of the
new National Defense Strategy, which ended the post-9/11 focus on
counterterrorism to prioritize countering revisionist great powers like
China and Russia. The Trump administration has followed that by
initiating a bruising trade war with China by imposing hundreds of
billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, with Beijing
retaliating with its own tariffs in a tit-for-tat that is already
destabilizing global markets. The administration has also taken steps to
restrict Chinese purchases of U.S. tech firms and exports of U.S.
technology to China, with indictments and possible arrests in the
offing. Just this November, [two congressionally mandated reports
highlighted the stakes in what is rapidly becoming a Cold War- style
relationship of confrontation, suspicion, and containment.]{.underline}
The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said that
"China's state-led, market-distorting economic model presents a
challenge to U.S. economic and national security interests" and its
military modernization means "the United States and its allies and
partners can no longer assume achieving air superiority in an
Indo-Pacific conflict." Likewise, the National Defense Strategy
Commission warned that **[the U.S. military "might struggle to win, or
perhaps \[even\] lose, a war against China or Russia."]{.underline}**
Thucydides "These reports independently confirm what The Heritage
Foundation had separately concluded -- that [the U.S. military is far
weaker than is commonly appreciated,"]{.underline} wrote Dean Cheng, a
senior research fellow at Heritage. "As currently postured[, the U.S.
military is only marginally able to meet the demands of defending
America's vital national interests."]{.underline} Other analysts worry,
however, that **[a U.S. shift to a more Cold War-like posture of
pushback and containment of China risks falling into "Thucydides'
Trap]{.underline}**." The reference is to the ancient Greek historian's
recounting how [the rise of Athens challenged the established power of
Sparta,]{.underline} with an intertwining of "fear, honor, and interest"
[leading both city-states to mutually destructive war]{.underline}.
Thucydides' Peloponnesian War has been a model for strategists ever
since, with Germany's challenge to Great Britain in two World Wars the
most-cited example of his thesis in bloody action. Graham Allison, in
his 2017 book Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides'
Trap?, calculated that **[in 12 of the 16 cases throughout history in
which a rising power confronted a ruling power, the end result was
war]{.underline}**. (The great exception is how Britain, the global
superpower of the 19th century, overcame tensions with the rapidly
rising United States and made the U.S. an ally --- but that alliance is
based on a unique shared heritage of language, culture, and democratic
principles). "Based on the current trajectory, [war between the United
States and China in the decades ahead is not just possible, but much
more likely than recognized at the moment,]{.underline}" Allison wrote.
"Indeed, [judging by the historical record war is more likely than
not]{.underline}." President Trump and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis
Botching The Strategy Managing the rise of China without either
appeasement or open war will take a strategic sophistication the United
States hasn't exercised since the end of the Cold War. The Pentagon's
sobering National Security Strategy and the Trump administration's more
confrontational stance on trade with China are a start, but they have
yet to coalesce into the kind of "whole of government" response needed
to successfully manage a dangerous great power competition. President
Trump's own mercantilist instincts, disdain for multilateral
institutions and agreements, preference for the company of dictators and
transactional approach to allies are also undermining America's
alliances at a time when they need bolstering for the competition to
come. "I'm sympathetic to the general direction the Trump administration
is moving vis à vis China, but picking fights with our traditional
allies in Europe and Asia over trivial trade issues is shooting
ourselves in the foot," said Princeton's Friedberg. "Crucial to
formulating and implementing a new China strategy will be our ability to
articulate the democratic, liberal values that draws us together with
our allies and differentiates us from China." Navy photo Navy officers
from the US (left) and China (right) meet in Qingdao in 2014. But will
the end of accommodation inevitably lead to a Thuycides-trap conflict?
Ratner rejects the idea. "No one is arguing we should cut off diplomacy
and dialogue with China, which will be critical in maintaining stability
in the coming era of competition, but the National Security Strategy
explicitly states that the United States is seeking equilibrium that
makes it impossible for any one country to dominate Asia, and that is
already happening today," Ratner said. "Rather, [this permissive
environment that the United States has allowed to form in the South
China Sea is encouraging China to further impose its will in the region,
radically increasing the likelihood of conflict down the road when the
stakes will be even higher."]{.underline} Stapleton Roy, a former U.S.
ambassador to China, believes the goal of a revitalized strategy of
realistic engagement with China should be an equilibrium that blocks
Beijing's military domination of Asia, curbs China's worst mercantilist
policies, and concedes that outside forces have rarely been able to
change the domestic policies of great powers. With the United States
still possessing the world's most powerful military and innovative
economy, he said, that should still be well within our reach. "But don't
underestimate the challenge," Roy said at CSIS. "[China is eager to step
into the global leadership role that the United States has largely
abandoned, and it's outspending us in every sphere of
power]{.underline}. The harsh reality is [the United States poorly used
its post-Cold War period of dominance with conflicts in the Middle East
and the Great Recession straining our resources and polarizing our
politics]{.underline}. Clearly [U.S.-China relations should now be at
the center of our foreign policy concerns]{.underline}, and handled with
great creativity. So far we are not passing that test."

### AT: Retrenchment

#### Retrenchment is bad -- it's perceived as acquiescence to revisionist powers

[That willingness has been in doubt]{.underline} for some time, [well
before the election of Trump and even]{.underline} before [the election
of Barack Obama]{.underline}. Increasingly in the quarter century after
the end of the Cold War, [Americans have been wondering why they bear
such an unusual and outsized responsibility]{.underline} for preserving
global order [when their own interests are not always clearly
served]{.underline} --- and when the United States seems to be making
all the sacrifices while others benefit. Few remember the reasons why
the United States took on this abnormal role after the calamitous two
world wars of the 20th century. [The millennial generation born
after]{.underline} the end of t[he Cold War can hardly be expected to
understand]{.underline} [the lasting significance of the political,
economic, and security structures]{.underline} established after World
War II. Nor are they likely to learn much about it in high school and
college textbooks obsessed with noting the evils and follies of American
"imperialism." Both the crises of the first half of the 20th century and
its solution in 1945 have been forgotten. **[As a consequence, the
American public's patience with the difficulties and costs inherent in
playing that global role have worn thin]{.underline}**. Whereas previous
unsuccessful and costly wars, in Korea in 1950 and Vietnam in the 1960s
and 1970s, and previous economic downturns, such as with the energy
crisis and crippling "stagflation" of the mid- to late 1970s, did not
have the effect of turning Americans against global involvement, [the
unsuccessful wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the financial crisis of
2008 have.]{.underline} The Obama administration responded to the George
W. Bush administration's failures in Iraq and Afghanistan not by
restoring American power and influence but by further reducing them.
**[Obama pursued]{.underline}** an ambivalent approach to global
involvement, but his core strategy was **[retrenchment]{.underline}**.
In his actions and his statements, [he]{.underline} critiqued and
repudiated previous American strategy and [reinforced a national mood
favoring a much less active role in the world]{.underline} and much
narrower definition of American interests. The [Obama]{.underline}
administration [responded]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the George W.
Bush administration's [failures in Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}
[not by restoring American power and influence but by further reducing
them.]{.underline} Although the administration promised to "rebalance"
American foreign policy to Asia and the Pacific, in practice **[that
meant]{.underline}** reducing global commitments and **[accommodating
revisionist powers at the expense of allies' security]{.underline}**.
[The administration's early attempt to "reset" relations with Russia
struck the first blow to America's reputation as a reliable
ally.]{.underline} Coming just after the Russian invasion of Georgia,
[it appeared to reward Moscow's aggression]{.underline}. [The
reset]{.underline} also [came at the expense of U.S. allies in Central
Europe]{.underline}, as programs of [military cooperation with Poland
and the Czech Republic were jettisoned to appease the
Kremlin.]{.underline} This attempt at accommodation, moreover, came just
as Russian policy toward the West --- not to mention Putin's repressive
policies toward his own people --- was hardening. Far from eliciting
better behavior by Russia, [the reset emboldened Putin to push
harder]{.underline}. Then, in 2014, [the West's inadequate response to
the Russian invasion of Ukraine and seizure of Crimea]{.underline},
though better than the Bush administration's anemic response to the
invasion of Georgia (Europe and the United States at least imposed
sanctions after the invasion of Ukraine), still [indicated reluctance on
the part of the U.S. administration to force Russia back in its declared
sphere of interest.]{.underline} Obama, in fact, publicly acknowledged
Russia's privileged position in Ukraine even as the United States and
Europe sought to protect that country's sovereignty. [In Syria, the
administration practically invited Russian intervention through
Washington's passivity]{.underline}, and certainly did nothing to
discourage it, thus [reinforcing the growing impression of an America in
retreat across the Middle East]{.underline} (an impression initially
created by the unnecessary and unwise withdrawal of all U.S. troops from
Iraq). Subsequent [Russian actions that increased the refugee flow from
Syria into Europe]{.underline} also [brought no American response,
despite the]{.underline} evident [damage]{.underline} of those refugee
flows [to European democratic institutions]{.underline}. **[The signal
sent]{.underline}** by the Obama administration **[was
that]{.underline}** [**none of this was really America's problem.** In
East Asia, the Obama administration undermined]{.underline} its
otherwise commendable efforts to assert [America's]{.underline}
continuing interest and [influence]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
so-called ["pivot" proved to be mostly rhetoric]{.underline}.
[Inadequate overall defense]{.underline} [spending]{.underline}
[precluded]{.underline} the [necessary increases in America's regional
military presence]{.underline} in a meaningful way, [and]{.underline}
[the administration allowed]{.underline} [a critical economic component,
the Trans-Pacific Partnership, to die in Congress]{.underline}, chiefly
a victim of its own party's opposition. [The pivot also suffered from
the general perception]{.underline} [of]{.underline} American retreat
and [retrenchment]{.underline}, encouraged both by presidential rhetoric
and by administration policies, especially in the Middle East. The
premature, unnecessary, and strategically costly withdrawal of American
troops from Iraq, followed by the accommodating agreement with Iran on
its nuclear program, and then by the failure to hold the line on threats
to use force against Syria's president, was noticed around the world.
Despite the Obama administration's insistence that American strategy
should be geared toward Asia[, U.S. allies have been left wondering how
reliable the U.S. commitment might be when facing the challenge posed by
China.]{.underline} The Obama administration erred in imagining that it
could retrench globally while reassuring allies in Asia that the United
States remained a reliable partner. Left: An aerial photo taken on Jan.

meanwhile, **[has been to encourage greater efforts at
revision.]{.underline}** In recent years, **[both powers have been more
active in challenging the order, and one reason has been the growing
perception that the United States is losing both the will and the
capacity to sustain it.]{.underline}** The psychological and political
effect of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in the United States, which
has been to weaken support for American global engagement across the
board, has provided an opening. **[It is a myth]{.underline}**,

retrenchment, by this logic, ought to reduce tensions and competition.
Unfortunately, the opposite is more often the case. **[The more secure
revisionist powers feel, the more ambitious they are in seeking to
change the system]{.underline}** to their advantage **[because the
resistance to change appears to be lessening]{.underline}**. Just look
at **[both China and Russia]{.underline}**: Never in the past two
centuries have they enjoyed greater security from external attack than
they do today. Yet both remain dissatisfied and **[have become
increasingly aggressive in pressing what they perceive to be their
growing advantage]{.underline}** **[in a system where the United States
no longer puts up as much resistance]{.underline}** as it used to.

### AT: Offshore Balancing

#### Russia and China's expansion into the European heartland ensures the failure of offshore balancing. Growing economic integration and military modernization requires firm commitment to NATO and more forward deployments.

[Europe faces a serious new security dilemma.]{.underline} With the
cancellation of the INF Treaty as a result of [Russia's treaty-violating
nuclear build-up and modernization]{.underline}, **[Europe is now more
than ever exposed to Russian nuclear and conventional
threats]{.underline}**. Exacerbating Europe's security dilemma is a
combination of continuous [European military weakness]{.underline}, a
[nationalist turn of American foreign policy]{.underline} at the expense
of multilateral institutions, and a [growing presence of China in
Europe]{.underline}. These developments [are enormous challenges for the
Atlantic Alliance]{.underline} as well as for the European Union. They
take place at a time when China and Russia appear to be enlarging their
influence in Europe---China primarily on an economic level and Russia
militarily as well as based on its energy resources and growing soft
power. This calls for a new strategy of containment.\[1\] In the case of
Russia, there are also [political grievances resulting from the demise
of the Soviet Empire, territorial losses, and the shock this has
caused]{.underline} for the Russian national consciousness. In President
Vladimir Putin's [view, these developments]{.underline} amounted [to the
greatest geopolitical catastrophe]{.underline} of the twentieth century.
All this happened while the Atlantic Alliance remained united after the
end of the Cold War, contrary to the fate of the Warsaw Pact
which---like the Soviet Empire---also collapsed. [NATO and the EU even
kept enlarging]{.underline}, taking in former Soviet Republics as well
as Warsaw Pact member states, making NATO and the EU immediate neighbors
of Russia. [As a result, new tensions with Russia]{.underline} emerged,
and it is no surprise that after the peaceful end of the East-West
conflict, [the West ended up on a collision course with a resurgent
Russia.]{.underline} The Heartland Theory Geographer Halford Mackinder's
Heartland theory not only helps to understand America's engagement in
Europe after World War II. It is also useful to grasp the monumental
developments at the end of the Cold War, in particular its dramatic
impact on Russia. Most importantly, it helps explain the return of
Russia as a great power since the beginning of the twenty-first century.
First developed in an article "The Geographical Pivot of History," the
Heartland theory suggests that "[Who rules East Europe commands the
Heartland: Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island: Who rules
the World-Island commands the World]{.underline}."\[2\] The geopolitical
thinking of Mackinder provided the critical background and convincing
argument for the United States to take on a leadership role in the fight
against the political and military threat that Hitler's aggressive
policies posed for Europe and the entire world. Had Nazi Germany, after
invading France and threatening Great Britain, also defeated the Soviet
Union, the control of the vast resources of the Heartland---basically
the continental space between the waters of the North Atlantic in the
west and the Pacific coast in the east---could have led to the
domination of a totalitarian land power. By definition[, this would then
also have posed a fatal threat for the United States as a sea power on
the other side of the Atlantic.]{.underline} The important geostrategic
insight of the American political leadership at the time was that [the
Atlantic could no longer be the dividing line between East and
West.]{.underline} [America's security became inextricably linked with
the fate of the Heartland **not only as an offshore balancer, but with a
physical presence in Europe in its own security interest.**]{.underline}
The result was America's containment strategy designed by George F.
Kennan with the objective to bring about, primarily with political
means, either "the break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet
power."\[3\] [**As tempting as the idea of** reducing the role of the
United States to **offshore balancing might sound**]{.underline} for
scholars of the realist school, today **[the long-term consequences
could be catastrophic]{.underline}**. [Once influence-seeking strategies
such as the Russian and Chinese variations succeed, it is difficult---if
not even impossible---to reverse trends without restoring an effective
balance]{.underline} of power in the Heartland. After the end of the
Cold War and with the emergence of a multipolar international order
characterized by great power competition and growing uncertainty, if not
even system instability, [Mackinder's Heartland theory is no less
important. The theory is not only a geographic concept]{.underline}. The
importance of [the Eurasian landmass---its vast resources as well as its
political, economic, and military potential---is obvious]{.underline}
and self-evident. [More important,]{.underline} as anticipated by
Mackinder, [is the role of an organizer,\[4\] a power with controlling
political, economic, and military influence over the entire
Heartland]{.underline}. This is what Nazi Germany tried to achieve and
what the Soviet Union came close to achieving had the U.S. not put
together a "whole of government"---and also a "whole of
society"---effort of containment, including a firm military presence in
Europe. The Weight of Russia and China in the Heartland [Russia, and in
particular China,]{.underline} with their models of state capitalism
clearly [strive to offer to the rest of the world an alternative model
to Western market principles and democracy]{.underline}. Together, China
and Russia bring substantial economic and military power to the table.
Their cooperation with the objective to "present a counterweight to the
United States and other Western countries"\[5\] keeps growing and
creates a fundamental challenge for NATO as well as for the EU.
[Russia]{.underline}, although economically weaker, [possesses strong
military capabilities, in particular its powerful nuclear arsenal. The
country maintains escalation dominance in key conflict
areas]{.underline} in its near abroad. [This is painfully true in
Ukraine]{.underline}, particularly with the annexation of Crimea, [as
well as]{.underline} in the many frozen conflicts in Russia's
neighborhood such as [Georgia, Moldova, and Azerbaijan]{.underline}.
[Based on its energy resources, Russia holds sway over large parts of
eastern Europe and the western Balkans]{.underline}, competing
ferociously with the European Union in an effort to undermine the EU
enlargement strategy and to prevent eastern European countries and the
western Balkan states from joining NATO. Unfortunately, [even **the
combined military assets of the EU do not measure up to Russian military
forces**, not to mention Russia's geostrategic advantages as well as its
soft power based on cultural affinities and media
influence]{.underline}. A Common European Security and Defense Policy,
as Jolyon Howorth put it, is still "a work in progress," not to mention
a European Army worthy of such a name.\[6\] [With its Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), China already has a global strategic concept based on
infrastructure development]{.underline}, putting the country in a
position to project economic as well as political power with potential
military consequences. [The BRI already reaches deep into the Heartland
and is developing a substantial economic and potentially political
presence in Europe]{.underline} both east and west, including within
member states of the European Union. [With the Sixteen plus One concept,
China is trying to foster infrastructure cooperation with sixteen
eastern and central European countries]{.underline}, including eleven EU
member states. China's outreach also serves as a platform for
implementation of the global Belt and Road Initiative. Although
advertised as a peaceful design, **[the consequences for Europe are not
only benign]{.underline}**.\[7\] [Financial dependency]{.underline} is
one issue. More important is the fact that [EU decision-making on China
with regard to trade and investment, as well as foreign and security
policy,]{.underline} [will be more difficult**, undermining EU consensus
building.**]{.underline} **[China is now on its way to establishing
itself not only as a regional hegemon, but also as a global
power]{.underline}**. Already the second most important economic power,
[China keeps enlarging its military capabilities on land, at sea, as
well as in the air and in space]{.underline}. With regard to space
exploitation---demonstrated with the landing on the dark side of the
moon---China appears to be a global leader relying on its powerful
scientific infrastructure. Conclusion [The Russian and Chinese
authoritarian model of governance is already receiving support in
eastern Europe where an illiberal political system is gaining
attraction]{.underline} (as in Hungary and Poland), weakening the EU
from inside. Ironically, the Trump administration's turn to a distinct
national foreign policy at the expense of existing multilateral
institutions, such as NATO and the EU, as well as economic and trade
organizations such as the WTO, as instruments of cooperation,\[8\] could
well play into the hands of Russia and China. The result would be a
weakening of transatlantic ties. So far, [these ties helped create the
necessary balance to prevent a dominating influence of Russia and China
in the Heartland.]{.underline} The danger now is that, as a result of
the emerging collaborative power arrangement between the two rival
powers of the United States, their influence will grow substantially. In
addition, the Trump administration's trade policy as well as the use of
secondary trade sanctions create uncertainty with regard to market
access to the United States, accelerating the geopolitical shifts that
appear to be in the making. Simple economic rules of thumb suggest that
markets that are lost will not return. [Once driven out of U.S. markets
and turning to China, Russia, Japan, and other countries, transatlantic
trade and economic cooperation will decline]{.underline}. With a
population of more than a billion, China is not only a powerful export
champion, correctly accused of mercantilism; it is also a very
attractive export destination offering promising growth prospects for
Europe. [Without a push back, Europe could be drawn into the orbit of
China and Russia hoping for mutual benefits with stronger economic
ties]{.underline} in spite of crucial issues with regard to copyrights
and fair and mutual market access rules and regulations. [What appears
to be necessary now is a renewed]{.underline} containment strategy\[9\]
as a [political project based on a **firm U.S. commitment for
NATO**]{.underline} [as well as a **more proactive EU** security
and]{.underline} defense policy in combination with a **[more dynamic
enlargement strategy]{.underline}**. Whether it will work, however, is
unfortunately an open question.

### AT: Offshore Balancing -- East Asia

#### Offshore balancing in East Asia emboldens Chinese expansionism which collapses regional security. Hegemony is here to stay and it's key to preserving regional defense agreements.

Suppose Pauline Hanson, Australia's populist Senator from Queensland,
proposed the following: scrapping the surface fleet, buying a hundred or
two F-35s, building 36 submarines, earmarking the army for South Pacific
constabulary duty, doubling the defense budget, and developing nuclear
weapons. And all premised on the clairvoyant certainty the [Americans
will be gone from Asia in 20 years]{.underline}. Few Australians, or
Americans for that matter, would be saying, "you know....maybe she's
onto something." Yet, such recent proposals by Hugh White have caused
quite a stir in the Australian foreign policy community. Numerous and
highly capable Australian analysts have dissected Mr. White's
recommendations. However, since we are Americans, our analysis will
focus on the underlying premise of U.S. abandonment of Australia. [It is
rational for Australian defense planners to contemplate potential
scenarios where Australia may need to provide for its own defense
without the U.S. being in the fight]{.underline}. **[But planning for an
increasingly multipolar Asian order doesn't require that one must assume
U.S. abandonment.]{.underline}** To be sure, the specter of abandonment
has haunted security alliances throughout the history of international
relations, including the U.S.-Australia security alliance. However, it
would be strategic malpractice for Canberra to radically shift its
national defense strategy based on such tenuous assumptions without
empirical evidence and compelling logic. While we can not eliminate
uncertainty, we can objectively assess risk and there are no foreseeable
scenarios involving U.S. abandonment of Australia to which one can
assign a high degree of probability. In short, [for the U.S. to abandon
Australia is to abandon its national interests, strategic position and
credibility in Asia]{.underline}. Indeed, the U**[.S.-Australian
alliance has long served as an essential component of American grand
strategy in Asia that seeks to prevent another great power from
establishing regional hegemony]{.underline}**, maintain an open
multilateral trading system, and guarantee the freedom of navigation and
overflight. The foundation of U.S. power in Asia for over 70 years has
been the so-called hub-and-spokes security architecture consisting of
bilateral defense treaties and forward deployed military forces -- of
which Australia is an indispensable partner. As long as U.S. security
treaties remain in force and America maintains its forward deployed
force posture in the Asia-Pacific, it is highly likely if not a near
certainty that the U.S. would intervene militarily to defend Australia
in the event of a direct attack by China -- or even the threat thereof.
Despite the hand wringing over U.S. credibility and resolve, the
enduring strategic value of the U.S.-Australian strategic alliance is
something Australia can count on. So what is the probability of the U.S.
terminating its regional security alliances, withdrawing all forward
deployed forces, and abandoning its strategic position in Asia to China
in the next 20 years? Such a such a scenario is not inconceivable but is
highly improbable. [Even if peace breaks out between Seoul and Pyongyang
setting the stage for the potential withdrawal of U.S. military forces
from the Korean peninsula, or as the U.S. distributes forces from
Okinawa to Guam and beyond, there is still the problem with China
seeking to dominate the region.]{.underline} Thus, **[the U.S would
still maintain its regional security alliances with a forward deployed
force in mainland Japan and rotational forces in
Australia.]{.underline}** [The alternative is to acquiesce to PRC
pressure -- and slink back to Hawaii or the West Coast.]{.underline}
Washington shows no sign of doing that. But what [if the U.S. radically
shifts to an "offshore balancing" or other economy of force strategy
with the expectation of using Australian and other regional powers such
as Japan to check China's ambitions]{.underline}? Since **[there is no
combination of regional powers -- even if nuclear armed -- that could
withstand an onslaught from the PRC]{.underline}**, the U.S. would soon
find itself backpedaling to reassure nervous allies. The alternative is
at best fighting its way back across the Western and South Pacific --
assuming that's possible once the PRC fills the void -- including
political and psychological -- caused by talk of or an actual U.S.
"downsizing" in the region. [Ultimately, the U.S. will continue to have
vital national interests to uphold considering the importance of Asia to
American prosperity and economic security]{.underline}. And it cannot
maintain these interests without something akin to the existing regional
defense arrangement. Washington is Getting Real, Will Canberra? Even
more to the point, while domestic political fights in Washington over
Asia policy are inevitable, [there is no broad-based and powerful
coalition hell bent on dismantling the U.S. security architecture in
Asia or upending the U.S.-Australia security alliance.]{.underline} Over
the past few years the naively optimistic yet Wall Street friendly
"responsible stakeholder theory" has been discredited and grandiose
dreams of a G-2 world mugged by reality. In their place is a growing
bipartisan awareness in Washington that the U.S. and China have entered
a protracted period of strategic competition across multiple domains
(i.e. geopolitical, military, diplomatic, economic, financial,
technological) that will likely last decades. [The question has become
not whether the U.S. should check the PRC's revisionist -- and
potentially violent geopolitical ambitions, but how and at what
cost?]{.underline} But is it possible the U.S. could inevitably find
itself so overmatched by Chinese power that it is 'bulled' out of the
region -- even if it wishes to remain? This is not inevitable and is
only likely to happen if the U.S. allows it to happen. [Despite the
PRC's rapid military buildup and attendant economic growth over the last
twenty years, the United States still has a strong hand to
play.]{.underline} Besides having considerable military and economic
power of its own, **[the U.S. network of treaty allies and security
partners along with forward deployed forces overcomes the otherwise
daunting tyranny of distance and provides several geographical
advantages.]{.underline}** While China has the geographic advantages of
being a resident power with shorter lines of communication and
continental strategic depth, it has long been "hemmed in" by the First
and Second Island Chains which are controlled by the U.S and its allies.
[The PRC also has fewer friends willing and able to fight and die for
Chinese hegemony.]{.underline} In fact, Beijing bared its fangs about a
decade too soon -- and few regional nations have doubts about Chinese
ambitions and even fewer are asking the U.S. to withdraw from the
region. **[A shift to offshore balancing would flip the current
geographic advantages in favor of China and substantially raise the
costs in both blood and treasure for the United States to intervene
military to fulfill the role of balancer.]{.underline}** Instead,
Washington should strengthen its web of treaty allies and emerging
security partners -- facilitating greater cooperation and
interoperability between and among them -- with the key objective of
holding the line at the First and Second Island Chains. The Mateship
Starts To Thicken [Rather than planning for U.S. abandonment and Chinese
hegemony as inevitabilities, Australian defense strategists should
become advocates for an even stronger U.S.-Australian
alliance.]{.underline} Beyond an already solid, decades-old defense
relationship, recent developments suggest that Australia's role in the
[U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy is set to deepen and that the U.S. is
digging in rather than withdrawing. The large-scale biennial Talisman
Sabre exercise that kicked off recently in Queensland involving
Australian and US Navy and Marine forces with its largest ever Japanese
amphibious contingent highlights increasing
interoperability]{.underline}. This display follows the respective naval
and air forces of Australia, the U.S. and Japan working together during
the recent Pacific Vanguard and COPE North exercises in Guam. Expect
more of this, not less. Meanwhile, the Marine Rotational Force -- Darwin
is picking up speed and within a few years will fully expand to 2,500
U.S. Marines on the ground for six months of training during the dry
season. And there is talk of building a port about 40 km northeast of
Darwin -- ostensibly for civilian-military use -- that will allow U.S.
Navy amphibious ships to port nearby the Marines. [One can foresee a
year-round American presence with U.S. amphibious forces operating
farther afield in SE Asia during the wet months -- and it's likely
Australia's and possibly Japan's amphibious force will be linking
up.]{.underline} And, don't be surprised if longstanding talk of basing
US submarines and surface combatants for rotations at HMAS Stirling in
West Australia comes to fruition. It is also possible the historic
"mateship" will grow beyond traditional defense and intelligence
cooperation and include the realm of geoeconomics. [There are positive
signs that is already happening with Australia, Japan and the U.S.
signing the Trilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to
operationalize the Trilateral Partnership for Infrastructure Investment
in the Indo-Pacific in late 2018.]{.underline} Related to these efforts,
the U.S. announced that it will also partner with Australia and Papua
New Guinea in upgrading the Lombrum Naval Base on Manus Island in
addition to the goal of increasing electricity connectivity of PNG from
13 percent to 70 percent by 2030. Many more such initiatives and
committed funding are needed to promote high quality energy and
infrastructure projects as an alternative to China's Belt and Road
program with a particular focus on Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.
All things considered, if the US is planning on retreating from Asia --
and leaving Australia in the lurch -- it has a strange way of showing
it. A great strategic opportunity is in play if Washington and Canberra
choose to seize it. [But for Australia to operate based on an unfounded
fear of abandonment is not a strategy for victory or perhaps even
survival.]{.underline}

### AT: Offshore Balancing -- Walt & Mearsheimer

#### Mearsheimer and Walt's strategy of offshore balancing is self-contradicting and ignores the inherent imperialism of Rusisa

[John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt make a powerful case for
offshore balancing]{.underline} as a grand strategy for the United
States**[, but, when it comes to Russia and Europe, they refuse to draw
the logical consequences of their own framework. As a result, their
analysis implodes.]{.underline}** Here's how [Mearsheimer and Walt
define offshore balancing]{.underline}: Washington would forgo ambitious
efforts to remake other societies and concentrate on what really
matters: [pre­serving U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere and
countering potential hegemons in Europe, Northeast Asia, and the Persian
Gulf]{.underline}. Instead of policing the world, the United States
would encourage other countries to take the lead in checking rising
powers, intervening itself only when necessary. "How would it work?"
they ask. Here's the answer: the United States should turn to regional
forces as the first line of defense, letting them uphold the balance of
power in their own neighborhood... [If those powers cannot contain a
potential hegemon on their own, however, the United States must help get
the job done]{.underline}, deploying enough firepower to the region to
shift the balance in its favor. [Just what is a "potential hegemon"?
Such a state would have abundant economic clout, the ability to develop
sophisticated weaponry, the potential to project power around the
glo]{.underline}be, and perhaps even the wherewithal to outspend the
United States in an arms race. Such a state might even ally with
countries in the Western Hemisphere and interfere close to U.S. soil.
[And who might these potential hegemons be?]{.underline} Thus, the
United States' principal aim in Europe and Northeast Asia should be to
maintain the regional balance of power so that the most powerful state
in each region --- for now, [Russia and China]{.underline}, respectively
--- remains too worried about its neighbors to roam into the Western
Hemisphere. **[It would appear to follow from Mearsheimer and Walt's own
analysis that Russia is a potential hegemon]{.underline}**. If so, [it
would also appear to follow that the United States should turn to the
Europeans]{.underline} as the "first line of defense," [while being
ready to "help get the job done," if they fail to "contain" Russia "on
their own."]{.underline} I[n sum, Russia either already requires or may
soon require offshore balancing]{.underline}. Bizarrely, however,
**[when Mearsheimer and Walt then focus on Europe and Russia, they fail
to draw the logical consequences of their own analysis.]{.underline}**
First, they say, consistent with their argument, that "In Europe, the
United States should end its military presence and turn NATO over to the
Europeans." [Then they continue with a non sequitur: "There is no good
reason to keep U.S. forces in Europe, as no country there has the
capability to dominate that region.]{.underline} The top contenders,
Germany and Russia, will both lose relative power as their populations
shrink in size, and no other potential hegemon is in sight." But wait:
**[didn't Mearsheimer and Walt define Russia and China as potential
hegemons? Why, then, do they engage in an about-face and conclude that
Russia does not have the capacity to dominate the region?]{.underline}**
[No less puzzling is their assertion that Germany is a "top"
contender]{.underline}. [The one thing that unites all German elites and
publics is the guilt-ridden desire never to be a top
contender]{.underline}. [**In contrast, the one thing that unites all
Russian elites and publics is the desire to make Russia great again, not
just in its "near abroad," but in** Europe and,]{.underline} as Russia's
recent engagement in Syria demonstrates, in [**the world.** Especially
fatuous is Mearsheimer and Walt's claim that Germany and Russia "will
both lose relative power as their populations shrink in
size."]{.underline} While this claim is no doubt true --- and could be
made with equally breathtaking glibness about the United States and
China --- [**it fails to confront the fact that population decline is a
long-term process**. Russia]{.underline} may lose its relative power to
the point of insignificance fifty years from now, but it [would still
have forty-nine to wreak mayhem throughout the world. **Mearsheimer and
Walt must suspect that their argument is weak**]{.underline}, as they
continue with the following sentences: "Admittedly, leaving European
security to the Europeans could increase the potential for trouble
there. If a conflict did arise, however, it would not threaten vital
U.S. interests. Thus, there is no reason for the United States to spend
billions of dollars each year (and pledge its own citizens' lives) to
prevent one." Trouble indeed! [Putin Russia has launched two wars
already --- in Georgia and Ukraine, is threatening to seize Belarus, is
rattling sabers and violating the borders of the Baltic states, is
arming Kaliningrad and Crimea with medium- and long-range
missiles]{.underline}, has officially stated that it would use nuclear
weapons in response to a conventional threat, and is actively supporting
anti-Western, anti-American, and anti-European parties in Europe and the
"Western Hemisphere[". If Putin launches a massive invasion of Ukraine,
Belarus, or the Baltic states]{.underline} --- eventualities that some
of his minions have openly aired --- [the consequences would be deeply
destabilizing for Europe and the United States.]{.underline} [Forget the
crushing of democracy or the possibility of genocide --- eventualities
that might little disturb hard-nosed realists like Mearsheimer and Walt
--- and consider only the steams of refugees,]{.underline} the
spill-over into Poland, Finland, Hungary, and other states, and the
likelihood of Russia's imperial overreach [and possible subsequent
collapse.]{.underline} [Would vital U.S. interests be threatened if
Putin went on the warpath in Europe? Of course]{.underline}. Should the
United States be concerned and attempt to prevent such an outcome?
Obviously. And [Mearsheimer and Walt]{.underline}, at least for most of
their argument, [would agree. How could they have missed something so
obvious]{.underline}, and so obviously consist with their own argument?
One suspects that [their hard-nosed realist willingness to explain Putin
Russia's recent aggressions]{.underline} in terms of American policy and
NATO enlargement holds the key. Since, [in their version of reality,
Putin invaded Ukraine because of some ephemeral possibility of Ukraine's
joining NATO]{.underline} **[--- a possibility that no one, in Ukraine's
policy circles or in NATO's, would consider serious]{.underline}** ---
then it would follow that, by defanging the United States and NATO,
Putin will turn pacific and abjure expansion. [If]{.underline},
alternatively, [one takes Putin and his minions at their own
word]{.underline}, then **[one has to realize that Russian aggression is
to a large degree motivated by an imperial ideology]{.underline}** that
serves Putin's power and has deep roots in Russian political culture.
And [if, alternatively, one dispassionately examines the military
capacities of NATO states and sees]{.underline} that they pose [no
conceivable threat to Russi]{.underline}a, then **[one may also have to
realize that Putin's invocation of the NATO threat is either a cynical
ploy or the symptom of a paranoid megalomania. Scholars rarely admit
they were wrong, and Mearsheimer and Walt are no exception to this
rule.]{.underline}** Fortunately, they have now formulated a powerful
argument for containing Russia--- even if they refuse to accept their
own logic.

In their article, the writers say **[America\'s latest moves could spark
a global arms race for hegemony in space.]{.underline}** After
officially proposing a United States Space Force in June 2018, as the
sixth branch of the US military, [US President Donald Trump signed into
law the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal
Year 2019 in August to reestablish the US Space Command, which will
later be separated from the US Strategic Command as a fully unified
combatant command. **The Trump administration wants to create the Space
Force as a separate military command to ensure the US continues to enjoy
its military and other strategic advantages over other countries,
especially China and Russia**]{.underline}, according to three US
reports in the past two months. The US National Intelligence Strategy
report, issued last month, says: \"**[Russia and China will continue to
pursue a full range of anti-satellite weapons as a means to reduce US
military effectiveness and overall security\".]{.underline}** This claim
was reiterated in the Worldwide Threat Assessment, which says: \"[China
and Russia are training and equipping their military space forces and
fielding new anti-satellite weapons to hold US and allied space services
at risk\".]{.underline} And the US Missile Defense Review, the first
since 2010, indicates the possibility of the US establishing a space
missile defence system. [The development of Russian and Chinese space
technology has raised US concerns. China has achieved remarkable
progress in fields such as space vehicles, satellite launches, manned
space flight, and anti-satellite and sensor technologies making it a
leading player in aerospace technology and equipment.]{.underline} Sign
up According to the Blue Book of China Aerospace Science and Technology
Activities, in 2018 China launched the second-highest number of
spacecraft. **[The resultant pressure the US faces at home and abroad
prompted it to release the reports claiming China and Russia pose a
threat to US space systems]{.underline}**, [and the US risks falling
behind the two countries in space technology.]{.underline} On Feb 11,
the Challenges to Security in Space report issued by the US Defense
Intelligence Agency claimed [Russia and China \"have developed robust
and capable space services\" and \"to monitor, track and target US and
allied forces\", which was different from the Pentagon\'s previous
wording that **Russia and China are striving \"to catch up with the
US\".**]{.underline} As a leader in space technology, the US has been
vigilant against other countries developing space technology so as to
maintain its dominance in the field. [But the superpower with the
world\'s largest armed forces, 374 Marine and Air Force bases in about
140 countries has been facing increasing challenges, particularly from
China and Russia, in cutting-edge military technology, for example,
hypersonic weapons.]{.underline} **[Therefore, the US wants to extend
the battlefield to space and accelerate space
militarisation.]{.underline}** Since space weapons can be used against
real-time targets, the US wants to continue dominating space
technology－of the about 1,000 satellites in space, for example, 593
belong to the US. [The US has spent more money than any other country on
developing space weapons and its latest posture could spark a global
arms race in space.]{.underline} Many countries have military equipment
in space, mostly navigation and communication satellites, which can also
help trace enemy planes, take photographs and control missiles. But the
US is determined to remain the strongest military power in space. [It
appears therefore that Trump\'s proposal to establish the Space Force
will greatly benefit the US industry.]{.underline} By exaggerating the
space threat as well as promoting the militarisation of space, **[the US
aims to build another lucrative sector for its military industry as it
knows other countries will be compelled to buy US arms, which can help
consolidate the US\' dollar hegemony.]{.underline}**

#### Space weapons are dual use

An unclassified report released Jan. 15 by the Defense Intelligence
Agency does not reveal anything new about China's advances in space
technologies and capabilities. But it does highlight one major concern
for the Pentagon: **[China's military is becoming increasingly adept at
militarizing commercial space technologies.]{.underline}** The People's
Republic of [China is conducting "sophisticated satellite operations and
probably is testing on-orbit dual-use technologies that could be applied
to counterspace missions,]{.underline}" said the DIA in its first
unclassified report made public on China's military power. [China's
space advances in support of civil, economic and political goals could
provide the nation a significant edge in military
operations]{.underline}, the DIA said. Chinese military strategists
regard the ability to use space-based systems and deny them to
adversaries as central to enabling modern warfare. "As a result, the
People's Republic of China continues to strengthen its military space
capabilities despite its public stance against the militarization of
space," said the report. ["Space operations probably will form an
integral component of other PLA campaigns]{.underline}," the DIA said.
The report suggests [China is building up space capabilities as a way to
deter the United States or others from intervening in military conflicts
in the Asia-Pacific region. **China has parallel programs for military
and commercial communications satellites, and owns and operates about 30
satellites used for civil, commercial and military
communications**]{.underline}. By 2020 China will complete its global
constellation of 27 Beidou navigation satellites while maintaining a
separate regional constellation providing redundant coverage over Asia.
The first Beidou satellite was launched in 2000. Independent analysts
have revealed considerable details about China's growing arsenal of
counterspace capabilities such as directed-energy anti-satellite weapons
and satellite jammers. The DIA report said these developments continue
"even though the nation has not publicly acknowledged the existence of
any new counterspace programs since it confirmed it used an
anti-satellite missile to destroy a weather satellite in 2007." [The DIA
said U.S communications, reconnaissance, navigation and early warning
satellites "could be among the targets of attacks."]{.underline} Air
Force report on space threats The U.S. Air Force on Jan. 16 released an
unclassified report created by the National Air and Space Intelligence
Center that takes a broader look at the militarization of space. It
mentions both China and Russia as nations that are developing new space
capabilities to achieve military goals and reduce their reliance on U.S.
space systems. ["These countries continue to develop, test and
proliferate sophisticated anti-satellite weapons to hold U.S. and allied
space assets at risk,"]{.underline} said the Air Force report. China has
military units that have begun training with anti-satellite missiles,
the report noted, and Russia is reportedly developing an airborne laser
weapon system intended for use against space-based missile defense
sensors. The Air Force study cautions that while China and Russia are
the most capable competitors in space today, others are likely to
emerge. "Reduced cost, increased access, and proliferation of space
systems will drive more countries to integrate these systems into
military capabilities." **[The increasingly frequent application of
dual-use space technologies makes it more difficult for the United
States to discern between peaceful and potential hostile
activity]{.underline}**, the Air Force report said. For example, [future
satellite servicing and recycling incorporate a variety of technologies,
such as robotic arms to inspect, repair, or dispose of damaged
satellites]{.underline}. The same **[technologies have "inherent
counterspace capabilities that could be used to inspect non-consenting
satellites or to cause physical damage."]{.underline}**

President Trump's recent declaration of a new Space Force was met with
ridicule in many quarters. [Yet, the reality is that the United States
does urgently need a dedicated military space branch that is separate
from its Air Force.]{.underline} Space Matters: While the United States
has somewhat neglected its space program over the past twenty-five
years, [China has escalated its efforts in this area, including
launching numerous manned space flights, landed a rover on the moon, and
deployed multiple unmanned space stations]{.underline}. This has spurred
a regional space race with India, Japan, South Korea, North Korea,
Taiwan, and Iran and more besides. [The goal for the most ambitious of
these states is not merely to equal American accomplishments, but to
push past them]{.underline}, including establishing permanently manned
space stations, landing astronauts on the Moon and Mars, and building
lunar habitations. If achieved, these feats could knock the United
States out of the lead in space for the first time since Soviet
Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin orbited the earth in 1961. The rise of these
competitors poses real challenges for the United States, including most
worryingly a possible militarization of space by unfriendly forces.
[China demonstrated this peril in 2007 when it used a satellite killer
to destroy one of its own satellites, raising the possibility that it
could deploy a battery of these kinetic kill vehicles to paralyze
America's communications grid in a future war**. This is merely the tip
of the iceberg**]{.underline} of what China and others could do if they
are allowed to dominate space, [including constructing orbital missile
platforms]{.underline} that could be used to intimidate or even attack
the United States and its allies. [Resource competition is also a major
concern, with the need to locate and tap into alternative resource pools
becoming increasingly important as the world burns ever more rapidly
through its remaining natural resources]{.underline}. The potential for
the harvesting of metals, minerals, water, and other materials from the
moon and asteroids by states such as **[China and Japan could begin as
early as 2025]{.underline}**. [If the United States lags behind its
rivals in building the capacity and human expertise in this area, as
well as in protecting its own efforts to conduct this kind of resource
harvesting, this will have a ripple effect on its ability to maintain
its superpower status,]{.underline} both in space and terrestrially.
Finally, [terrestrial communications increasingly depend upon Global
Navigation Satellite Systems]{.underline}. America has possessed
relative hegemony in this area through its Global Positioning System for
decades, but this is now coming under fire from the new Chinese Beidou,
European Galileo, and Russian GLONASS systems -- with Japan and India in
close pursuit. American can ill afford to risk having its systems
potentially compromised should one or more other powers decide to try to
shut its communications network down once their version is fully
operational. Space Law is Deficient: The United States needs to protect
its interests and prevent other states from achieving dominance in
space. [It cannot depend upon international law acting as a check
against the potential overreach and aggression of other states in this
domain.]{.underline} One reason for this is that [most space laws were
drawn up during the Cold War and, as a result, are often vague towards
current day issues or omit them altogether.]{.underline} This provides
considerable leeway for the rising space states to act aggressively
under the pretext of operating in legal grey zones, even if their
actions go against the spirit of the law. Even in those cases where the
law is clear, [the new space states may break it to achieve particularly
high priority goals]{.underline} (even if they will never acknowledge
their acts as breaches of the law). [History is plagued with examples of
these violations on earth, such as the recent Russian illegal annexation
of Crimea and China's decision to disregard the 2016 ruling by the
International Court of Justice against its activities in the South China
Sea]{.underline}. There is no reason to believe that states that have
placed their strategic interests ahead of the law on earth in the past
are likely to behave any differently in space in the future. The
limitations of international space law, along with the likely
willingness of the rising space states to disregard it when advantageous
to them, means that the United States needs to supplement its respect
for the law with the maintenance of an effective military space force.
This is essential for helping it to protect and advance its interests in
space, as well as to avoid falling behind its rivals. Space-Mindedness:
[Some analysts might agree with the above points but argue that this
force requirement can be best met by maintaining America's military
space assets inside its Air Force.]{.underline} This was the same logic
that was advanced regarding the Air Force itself during the early 20th
century, at which time America's air assets were housed primarily in the
Army and to a lesser degree the Navy. Keeping America's military air
assets split between the Army and Navy was a bad idea because it
inherently shepherded the use of air power towards the accomplishment of
ground and maritime goals. This prevented America's air power from
achieving its full potential by hampering the appearance of a more
comprehensive approach towards airpower at tactical, operational, and
strategic levels, often referred to as "Air-Mindedness." The
narrow-sightedness of this approach was finally recognized and corrected
in 1947 when the U.S. Air Force was created as a separate branch. Today,
most of America's military space assets operate as Air Force Space
Command in the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). This places
them as a branch of the Air Force, operating under a broader combined
command that involves seven different mediums. This may be admirably
inter-service in intent, but subordinating America's military space
assets to other entities in this way limits the ability of space power
specialists to develop a "Space-Mindedness" in the same way that keeping
America's air assets within the Army and Navy hindered the development
of "Air-Mindedness." This curtails [America's space assets from being
able to concentrate on pivotal new space challenges, such as
space-to-space]{.underline} (rather than just space-to-ground)
[interactions with rival powers and the defense of American military and
civilian equipment in orbit and beyond.]{.underline} America's military
space assets have also been bedeviled by a constrained ability to
represent their importance to the government and the public directly.
Despite protestations that the Air Force already does space, it
allocates surprisingly few resources to this area: Space Command
consists of just 38,000 personnel and an estimated budget of \$25
billion. This can be compared to an overall Air Force tally of roughly
320,000 personnel and \$155 billion. [By standing as an independent
agency, the Space Force could lobby more effectively for space to
feature higher on the Pentagon's agenda and for it to be allocated the
budget that the domain deserves.]{.underline}

Today [conservationists]{.underline} and other critics are more likely
to [see space programs as militaristic splurges that squander billions
of dollars]{.underline} better applied to solving problems on Earth.
These well-meaning complaints are misguided, however. Earth's
problems---most urgently, **[climate change---can be solved only from
space.]{.underline}** That's where the tools and data already being used
to tackle these issues were forged and where the solutions of the future
will be too. [Space research has already been critical in averting one
major environmental disaster. It was NASA satellite data that revealed a
frightening]{.underline} and growing [hole in the ozone layer over the
South Pole, galvanizing public concern that, in 1987, produced the
Montreal Protocol]{.underline}: the first international agreement
addressing a global environmental problem. Since then, thanks to
worldwide restrictions on damaging chlorofluorocarbons, the ozone
situation has stabilized, and a full planetary recovery is expected. As
this case showed, [space can provide]{.underline} the [vital information
needed to understand a problem]{.underline}---and a surprising range of
ways to solve it. **[Climate change is a poster child for the critical
role of space data]{.underline}**. [Trekking across the globe to measure
ice sheets with drills]{.underline} and gauge sea temperatures from the
sides of ships [is an expensive, slow, and insufficient way to assay the
state of the planet.]{.underline} [Satellites]{.underline} operated by
NASA, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and an
increasing number of commercial firms [provide]{.underline} a plethora
of multispectral imaging and radar [measurements of]{.underline}
developments such as [coral reef degradation, harmful plankton blooms,
and polar bears]{.underline} [negotiating thinning ice.]{.underline}
Much of the technology involved in observing the Earth today was
initially developed for probes sent to explore other planets in our
solar system. IT WAS NASA SATELLITE DATA THAT REVEALED A FRIGHTENING AND
GROWING HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER OVER THE SOUTH POLE, GALVANIZING PUBLIC
CONCERN THAT, IN 1987, PRODUCED THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL: THE FIRST
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT ADDRESSING A GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM.
Indeed, [understanding the evolution of other planets' climates is
essential for modeling possible outcomes on Earth]{.underline}. [NASA
probes revealed how]{.underline}, roughly 4 billion years ago, a runaway
[greenhouse gas]{.underline} syndrome [turned Venus into a hot, hellish,
and uninhabitable planet]{.underline} of acid rain. Orbiters, landers,
and rovers continue to unravel the processes that transformed a once
warm and wet Mars into a frigid, dry dust ball---and [scientists even to
conceive of future scenarios that might terraform it back into a livable
planet]{.underline}. **[Discovering other worlds' history]{.underline}**
and imagining their future [**offers important visions for climate
change mitigation strategies on Earth,** such as mining helium from the
moon]{.underline} itself [for future clean energy. Spinoff technologies
from space research, from GPS to semiconductor solar cells, are already
helping to reduce emissions;]{.underline} the efficiency gains of
GPS-guided navigation shrink fuel expenditures on sea, land, and air by
between 15 and 21 percent---a greater reduction than better engines or
fuel changes have so far provided. [Modern solar photovoltaic power also
owes its existence to space]{.underline}. The first real customer for
solar energy was the U.S. space program; applications such as the giant
solar wings that power the International Space Station have continually
driven improvements in solar cell performance, and [NASA first
demonstrated the value of the sun for powering communities on Earth by
using solar in its own facilities.]{.underline} Promisingly, space-based
solar power stations could overcome the inconvenient truth that wind and
solar will never get us anywhere near zero emissions because their
output is inherently intermittent and there is, so far, no
environmentally acceptable way to store their power at a global scale,
even for one night. [Orbital solar power stations]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [would continually face the sun, beaming clean power back
through targeted radiation to Earth day or night, regardless of weather.
They would]{.underline} also be free from clouds and atmospheric
interference and therefore [operate with many times the efficiency of
current solar technology]{.underline}. [Moving solar power generation
away from Earth]{.underline}---already possible but held back by the
current steep costs of lifting the materials into space---[would
preserve land and cultural resources]{.underline} from the blight of
huge panel farms [and save landfills from the growing problem of
discarded old solar panels. Sustainable energy advocates]{.underline} in
the U.S. military and the Chinese government [are actively pursuing
space-based solar power,]{.underline} but just making solar cells
damages the environment due to the caustic chemicals employed. [Space
technology offers the possibility of freeing the Earth's fragile
biosphere and culturally important sites from]{.underline} the otherwise
[unavoidable damage]{.underline} caused by manufacturing and mining. The
U.S. start-up Made in Space is currently taking the first steps toward
manufacturing in orbit. The company's fiber-optic cable, produced by
machinery on the International Space Station, is orders of magnitude
more efficient than anything made on Earth, where the heavy gravity
creates tiny flaws in the material. Made in Space and others are
eventually planning to build large structures, such as solar power
stations, in space. [As these technologies develop, they will augment
each other, bringing costs down dramatically; space manufacturing, for
instance, slashes the cost of solar installations in space.]{.underline}
MINING THE SOLAR SYSTEM COMES WITH ITS OWN POTENTIAL IMPACTS, BUT
EXTRACTING RESOURCES FROM DISTANT AND LIFELESS WORLDS IS CLEARLY
PREFERABLE TO THE CONTINUED DEGRADATION OF THE EARTH. Eventually, [firms
will be able to supply endeavors in space with materials from the moon
and asteroids]{.underline}, avoiding the cost and environmental impact
of lifting them into orbit. Mining the solar system comes with its own
potential impacts, but [**extracting resources from distant and lifeless
worlds is clearly preferable to the continued degradation of the
Earth**.]{.underline} Perhaps the most powerful role space can play is
as inspiration. Space tourism might seem like a frivolity for the rich,
but it can be so much more. I've spent some time with astronauts, and
they all report that seeing the Earth without borders and observing its
fragile atmosphere shook them to their core, inspiring in them a
powerful sense of connection and respect for the environment. As Andrew
Newberg, a neuroscientist and physician who has studied this "overview
effect," put it, "You can often tell when you're with someone who has
flown in space. It's palpable." Subjecting thousands of the world's
wealthiest and most powerful individuals to a transcendent experience
couldn't hurt---especially if less wealthy Earthlings soon get a chance
to follow them. The leaders of the biggest space firms are already
thinking way beyond tourism. Tory Bruno, the CEO of United Launch
Alliance, envisions a future in which a thousand or more people work in
Earth and moon orbits. These people would build stations, conduct
research, and produce goods for use in space and on Earth. The Amazon
mogul Jeff Bezos imagines a spacefaring civilization that keeps our home
planet pristine and protected, as a sort of national park, while dirty
extractive and manufacturing processes take place in orbital facilities.
SpaceX's Elon Musk wants to transform Mars back into the healthy world
it once was and then fill it with life-forms from Earth---including a
significant human population. Some experts have mocked this idea. But
experts also lampooned Musk's plans for reusing rocket boosters and
building a high-performance electric car for the masses. The fact is
that [while]{.underline} some of the [plans described by Musk, Bezos,
and others might seem utopian or hubristic]{.underline}, given the
realities of climate change, [humanity needs hope]{.underline}. [A
future that concentrates only on managing apocalypse]{.underline},
[without offering the potential for something better, is no future at
all]{.underline}. In the worst scenario, **[our precious blue-and-green
marble will end up looking like its neighbors Venus or Mars simply
because we chose not to learn from them.]{.underline}**

In the ongoing contest for standing among nations, a factor many fail to
consider is space. [The vast resources of space could tip the balance in
favor of whichever nation proves most successful in exploiting them and
ensuring the security of the celestial lines of commerce. States pay
close attention to economic opportunities that do not even amount to a
single percent of their GDP.]{.underline} States play hardball over
energy resources that are mere years of domestic supply. But within
space lies not a percent, not 10 percent, not 100 percent of a nation's
GDP, but many, many times the value of the entire global GDP in
resources. **[Within space is not a small energy source, but sufficient
supply of constant solar energy to light a fully developed world six to
seven times over.]{.underline}** As poetically explained in Bob Zubrin's
The Case for [Space, nothing is a resource until the cleverness of
humanity makes it so.]{.underline} Today's global order features a
rapidly rising China, soon to pass the United States in real GDP. Behind
it, another space-faring power, India, is expected to eclipse China
circa 2050. [But space resources could make all the
difference]{.underline}. **[Accessing multitrillion dollar-asteroids or
multitrillion-dollar power markets could accelerate China's rise,
prolong U.S. hegemony, or enable a late-blooming India to overtake
China]{.underline}**. At midcentury, it could permit China to hang on to
its number one spot, allowing it to stay rich long after it grows old.
Or it could enable India with its young and vibrant population to
surpass China far sooner than either expects. As with access to the
resources of the New World or Africa, **[the scramble for such resources
is entirely undecided and rests upon the ingenuity of each country's
respective tech sectors and the wisdom of their national
policies.]{.underline}** The winner might not even be one of today's
economic giants. [First-mover advantages can be ephemeral and new
technologies can be copied. Organization-of-capital and
market-friendliness may be even more importan]{.underline}t, and ---
like Portugal in the Age of Sail --- even small countries like
Luxembourg or UAE might be in a position to command vast wealth. China
is the first major power to adopt a national strategy to access and
secure space resources. But while neither U.S. or Indian civil space
programs are yet to focused on building the elements of space industrial
power, [there is dawning awareness in both the United States and India
that China's moves may be important and must be answered.]{.underline}
While first-mover advantages may be ephemeral, [**owning the carrying
trade and commanding market share can bring disproportionate power to
shape markets and set rules**. Large market share often results in
feedback where high volumes enable progressively lower costs and greater
market share. Examples such as the iPhone show how quickly new products
and markets can develop and scale.]{.underline} **[Asteroid mining and
space solar power may appear conceptual today, but could rapidly enter
an exponential phase to disrupt existing markets.]{.underline}** At the
center of today's security concerns are chokepoints where oil and liquid
natural gas are shipped. [Energy-producing states enjoy significant
power to shape the international order to their
preferences.]{.underline} It will be the same in our spacefaring future.
As China first prototypes and then proves the technology for solar power
satellites, it will be rapidly populated with orbital power stations and
the geostationary satellite belt will assume grand geostrategic
importance as the hub of the worlds power grid. [The resource-rich North
and South Poles of Earth's moon, and the intermediate points between the
moon and Geostationary Orbit (GEO) will be the primary lanes of material
commerce to service and build the]{.underline}m --- at least until some
intrepid nation captures and begins to mine asteroids. [Once humanity
has proven the ability to source in-space resources and to construct
large industrial structures, the momentum will be
unstoppable]{.underline}. [More and more of our important industries
will move to space]{.underline}. First high bandwidth internet, then
electrical power, then [specialized manufacturing]{.underline} (fiber,
crystals, specialty parts, biotech). The [cost of transportation will
continue to drop and open up more markets and opportunities to develop
new products and services]{.underline}. The population of human beings
in space for commercial purposes will grow, and eventually, agriculture
and real estate itself will become a market. It will become
progressively easier to go further into the solar system. [With over a
billion times the resources of planet Earth waiting in outer space, the
nations that can command the highest productivity resources and
industries will wield disproportionate wealth and power on
Earth]{.underline}. That leader will be established in the next two
decades, and likely endure for a century. Who that leader is unknown,
but they will be writing the future of Earthly power.

## Scenario -- Dollar Heg

### 1NC -- Shell

#### American leadership & hard power is key to dollar hegemony because of credit security -- that's key to the economy

**Smart 18** (Christopher Smart, 12-16-2018, \"The Future of the
Dollar---and Its Role in Financial Diplomacy,\" Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace,
https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/12/16/future-of-dollar-and-its-role-in-financial-diplomacy-pub-77986
)

[The dollar's central role in world financial markets reflects both
faith in American leadership and the absence of reasonable
alternatives.]{.underline} [Currency dominance has also been a linchpin
in America's efforts to shape a global order around free markets and
democracy while serving as a foundation for the sustained growth of a
more integrated global economy.]{.underline} These roles now face rising
risks. Both Republicans and Democrats question the benefits of an open
and integrated economic order that seems to drain good jobs and demand
repeated bailouts of bad banks and corrupt foreign governments.
Meanwhile, allies and rivals alike raise doubts about the durability of
U.S. leadership and the wisdom of depending so heavily on one dominant
power. Such talk hardly portends imminent financial collapse or
reconfiguration of the global order. [America's military and political
strength remain paramount and investors still retreat to dollars
whenever risks mount]{.underline}---even when those risks originate in
the United States itself. Nevertheless, signs of an unravelling
consensus are unmistakable. They lie not in the declining percentages of
U.S. currency held in sovereign reserves, but rather the weakening faith
in America's ability to hold the system together. The clues are in the
early elements of financial plumbing that bypass dollar markets,
international financial institutions without active U.S. participation
and increasingly rudderless economic gatherings of finance ministers.
[The risks for the existing global order are not that another power will
displace Washington on these issues, but that there will be no
leadership in areas that have become increasingly important to global
commerce. Worse, the response to the next financial crisis will be
uncoordinated and disastrous.]{.underline} The U.S. midterm elections
have triggered some renewed debate about America's global agenda, yet
there have been few voices to remind voters that international financial
leadership benefits Americans and not just America's banks. In fact,
global dependence on access to the dollar gives Washington leverage to
coordinate battles against terrorism and cybercrime, to shape rules
against corruption and tax avoidance, and to protect privacy through the
regulation of global data flows that will drive the next decades of
economic innovation. Meanwhile, the United States must also build on
summit communiques to make concrete progress in these areas with
skeptical allies and rivals. For all its fits and starts, [U.S.
leadership continues to provide a crucial global framework for strong,
sustainable and balanced growth]{.underline}. Yet faith in the dollar
will only endure with a sense that the United States' role has evolved
from chief executive to managing partner that champions the integrity of
a global financial system along with its own interests. The fundamental
choice to transact, invest or save in dollars reflects a judgement that
they are most useful for those purposes. These judgements are slow and
cumulative, but the choices can shift surprisingly and decisively. In
many ways, the dollar emerged later than it should have, but perhaps
sooner than expected. The U.S. economy surpassed Britain's in the 1870s
and was a larger exporter by the First World War. Yet the dollar first
gained preeminence in bond markets by 1929, only to cede leadership back
to sterling with the Great Depression. [The end of the Second World War
left the United States paramount with victorious armed forces, an
unmatched economy and a network of global interests. In the decades
since then, however, the dollar has endured the end of gold
convertibility, inflationary fevers, expanding trade gaps, ballooning
fiscal deficits, intermittent government shutdowns, a global financial
crisis and even the loss of the U.S. Triple-A bond rating. Foreign firms
use dollars because their customers, suppliers and competitors
do]{.underline}. In one survey by Harvard economics professor Gita
Gopinath, now the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) chief economist,
the share of global trade invoiced in dollars is more than three times
the U.S. share of global exports. Foreign governments accumulate dollars
in reserves because they like to manage their own exchange rate against
the world's major trading currency. According to the IMF, the dollar
still represents roughly 62 percent of all sovereign reserves, with the
euro at 20 percent and the renminbi still accounting for less than 2
percent even though its share in global trade and finance is rising.
Finally, investors favor dollars in part because firms and governments
do, but also because the dollar markets are the deepest and most
sophisticated, which makes them likely to be less expensive to tap for
loans and more likely to deliver a reliable return. [The economic
tradeoffs for the United States are clear. Issuing the world's reserve
currency offers the prospect to literally print money everyone accepts
to buy guns without giving up butter. The dollar's dominance also allows
the United States to delay or shift any costs of global adjustment to
other countries. Another benefit, the United States pockets the
"seigniorage" income from what are effectively no-interest loans from
the foreigners who hold two-thirds of the \$100 bills in circulation.
Among the costs, America's easy access to low-cost credit may contribute
to a stronger exchange rate that hurts exports and makes fiscal and
trade deficits larger. **Washington also bears responsibility to provide
dollars and safe assets in a crisis.**]{.underline} Some of [the
dollar's durability comes from the absence of viable
alternatives.]{.underline} Europe's common currency was a political
project to bind the continent after centuries of war, although a clear
aspiration of some European leaders has been to create a counterweight
to dollar dominance. Yet the European financial crisis fragmented its
financial markets and triggered questions about the viability of the
European project itself. Postwar Japan deliberately protected the yen
from an international role so that domestic capital could be directed
for domestic purposes and the exchange rate could be managed. More
recently, Japanese economic woes and competition from China have
proscribed any real role for the yen, which remains at roughly 4.5
percent of international reserves. Chinese officials have a clear aim to
expand the role of the renminbi in global trade, finance and sovereign
reserves. For example, foreign governments have issued debt and central
banks have established swap lines in Chinese currency. Even the likes of
Germany and Chile have added it to the mix of their global reserves. Yet
for now the reach of China's currency remains restricted. Even if there
is no economic crisis that interrupts more than two decades of
blistering growth and reforms open the capital account and exchange
rate, China's domestic financial markets are not deep or liquid enough
to absorb vast global flows. [Ultimately, these require fundamental
reforms in corporate governance, regulatory transparency and a system of
checks and balances that a government can trust.]{.underline} Even the
nineteenth century Rothschilds preferred lending money to constitutional
monarchs, whom they considered better credit risks than unconstrained
absolute monarchs. "[Great powers have great currencies,"]{.underline}
wrote the Nobel Laureate Robert Mundell, and [it seems uncontroversial
that global influence and global money are intertwined]{.underline}.
Indeed, if the military strength and economic wealth of the United
States underpin the dollar's central role, [America's global influence
is enhanced because its currency dominates trade, finance and sovereign
reserves.]{.underline} In the extreme, the United States has been known
to leverage its military strength on behalf of economic interests---and
indeed, the dollar itself. At different times, for example, Japan,
Germany and Saudi Arabia have been reminded that U.S. security
guarantees warranted their financial support when the dollar came under
strain. Alternatively, during the Suez Crisis, the dollar's dominance
allowed the United States to force a British military withdrawal under
threat of triggering a run on sterling. Yet much [**of the dollar's
influence stems directly from the prestige of America's institutions**
and trust in its intentions. Military and economic power support the
dollar's dominant share of trade and investment, but **faith in U.S.
political institutions has bolstered its role as both a reserve currency
and a safe haven.**]{.underline} In a world of imperfect choices, [other
countries have come to rely on the U.S. record of building rules-based
financial institutions, proposing agendas for policy coordination and
shaping progress toward open markets.]{.underline} This has been the
story of the postwar Bretton Woods institutions, U.S. engagement in debt
relief negotiations and the response to financial crises. Meanwhile,
currency power ultimately depends on trust in the intentions of the
issuer. The issuer's interests may naturally come first, but its [usage
will grow if these interests are essentially aligned with shared goals
of global growth and stability.]{.underline} The most important economic
conferences of the twentieth century convened military and political
allies for difficult negotiations around monetary and financial policy.
How much more difficult will these discussions become with strategic
rivals around the table? How eager will China or Russia be to cooperate
when the G20 leaders next convene to address a global crisis? The United
States put its own interests first long before the Trump administration,
but it has generally interpreted this to include the construction of
global financial rules and institutions that apply to all. The growing
concerns among allies and rivals are the doubts of bank customers who
have been told that all fees have been raised because management needs
to prioritize shareholders first. The statement may be technically
correct, but it's a questionable business strategy. At a moment when
other economic powers continue to emerge, these agreed rules and shared
constraints become all the more important to protect U.S. interests.
Amid accelerating political and technological change, they become more
valuable still.

Britain as the leading global empire, the US dollar began to gain on
sterling as the currency that most central banks preferred to hold in
reserve. Reserve currency status had long been a perk of imperial
might - and an economic elixir. By generating a steady flow of customers
who want to hold the currency, often in the form of government bonds, it
allows the privileged country to borrow cheaply abroad and fund a
lifestyle well beyond its means. Other countries watched the United
States assume this role with dismay. In the 1960s, Valéry Giscard
d\'Estaing, then finance minister and later president of France, called
the US dollar\'s powerful status America\'s \"exorbitant privilege\".

government deficits that they could not otherwise afford.

SHANGHAI, June 14 (Reuters) - **[Competitive currency devaluation does
not benefit any country and could cause chaos to global financial
order]{.underline}**, former China central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan
said on Friday. Zhou did not specifically mention the Chinese yuan in
his remarks to a financial forum in Shanghai on Friday. B[ut global
investors are closely watching the weakening currency as the U.S.-China
trade war escalates.]{.underline} The [yuan has fallen about 2.7 percent
to the dollar since a major flare-up in trade tensions]{.underline} in
early May and [is nearing the psychologically critical 7 per dollar
mark**, a level last seen during the global financial crisis a decade
ago.**]{.underline} Zhou told financial media Caixin in late May that
whole numbers "do not really much matter" to the exchange rate, and 7 is
not necessarily the threshold for yuan to the dollar. While most
analysts do not expect a sudden yuan devaluation from China as in 2015,
traders believe further weakness is inevitable if both sides impose more
tariffs. China should expand its markets and sell more goods to other
countries to offset the impact from decreasing exports to the United
States, Zhou told the Shanghai forum. "[If the trade war breaks out, it
will easily bring changes to the exchange rate, and it is likely to
challenge the consensus reached in the past to prevent competitive
devaluation]{.underline}," Zhou said. (Reporting by Winni Zhou and David

Rising global trade tensions are morphing into a conflict fought with
[currency devaluations that historically have proven even more important
than tariffs in influencing economic growth and financial
markets.]{.underline} If this trend continues, [**the ultimate impact
will likely be negative for asset valuations.** This shift, which is
aimed at gaining export competitiveness]{.underline}, is important for
investors partly because [it will increase volatility in
foreign-exchange rates, making expected returns from global investments
less predictable.]{.underline} [These devaluations also could increase
the U.S. trade deficit rather than reduce]{.underline} it as desired by
President Donald Trump. [It's]{.underline} now [not out of the question
for the U.S. to undertake measures to weaken the dollar, leading to
another round of currency depreciations.]{.underline} The [MSCI Emerging
Markets Currency Index has dropped about 6 percent]{.underline} since
the start of April, [led by declines in the Argentine peso, the
Brazilian real and Turkish lira. Among developed markets, the currencies
of New Zealand, the U.K. and the euro zone have dropped the most,
weakening at least 4.90 percent]{.underline}. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot
Index, meanwhile, has risen 4.44 percent. The weaker Argentine peso,
which is now at a record low, will enhance Argentina's ability to
compete with U.S. exporting firms following the imposition of Chinese
tariffs on agricultural imports from the U.S. [India's rupee fell to its
lowest level ever on June 28, making it the worst-performing Asian
currency]{.underline} in the first half of 2018. The rupee's weakness,
which stemmed in part from an expected increase in the merchandise trade
deficit due to the higher price of imported oil, will boost the
competitiveness of Indian manufactured goods in world markets. Among
developed-country central banks, Bloomberg News reported June 29 that
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned leaders of the
European Union that the adverse impact on the global economy of trade
tariffs had been understated. If Draghi truly believes that, then the
ECB could delay boosting interest rates until at least mid-2019, further
weakening the euro. [The Bank of Japan shows no sign that it's ready to
tighten monetary policy]{.underline}, suggesting the yen will likely
continue to weaken after falling 4 percent against the dollar last
quarter. Among other items, that could boost the country's automobile
exports to the U.S. and widen the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Japan's
automakers already exported 10 percent more cars to the U.S. in the
first quarter of 2018 compared with a year earlier. Given these
developments, it's probably not a surprise that Larry Kudlow, director
of the White House National Economic Council, took the highly unusual
move of urging the Federal Reserve go slow in increasing interest rates.
**[Too sharp a tightening of monetary policy might cause the dollar to
quickly appreciate further, threatening U.S. exports and
jobs.]{.underline}** **[Tit-for-tat currency devaluations have been
tried before and have always ended badly for global
markets]{.underline}**. In September 1931, in the throes of the

devaluing]{.underline} it. By the end of the year[, several more
countries had followed because they could not cede trade advantage to
British products.]{.underline} Repetitive devaluations persisted into
1933 when Franklin D. Roosevelt, on becoming U.S. president in March of
that year, ordered all gold coins be turned in for other currencies ---
[essentially a default on U.S. sovereign obligations. The U.S. went off
the gold standard that June, completing the devaluation
process]{.underline}. While the various central banks expected the
resulting monetary expansion to boost global markets, **[the depression
continued through the end of the decade as devaluations increased

### 2NC -- I/L -- Capital Intensive Industries

#### Competitive currency devaluation collapses capital intensive industries

**Lozada 3** Carlos Lozada is the nonfiction book critic of The
Washington Post. He won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for Criticism and was a
finalist for the prize in 2018. \["Impact of Devaluations on Commodity
Firms," *National Bureau of Economic Research*, 2003, URL:
<https://www.nber.org/digest/dec02/w9053.html>\] DTS

During the late 1990s, [the global economy witnessed a string of major
currency devaluations and financial crises in Asia, South Africa,
Russia, and Brazil.]{.underline} In Cheap Labor Meets Costly Capital:
The Impact of Devaluations on Commodity Firms (NBER Working Paper No.
9053), author Kristin Forbes examines how such [devaluations affected
costs, production decisions, and profitability for commodity-producing
companies within the devaluing countries]{.underline} and for their
foreign competitors. She concludes that although devaluations in the
short run help domestic producers boost profits and output vis-à-vis the
rest of the world, [their long-term impact is more ambiguous and depends
on the firms\' relative dependence on capital and labor.]{.underline}
These conclusions run counter to the conventional notion that
devaluations reduce the cost of exports in international markets and
therefore boost exports from the devaluing country. Forbes first
considers the case of firms in a small, open economy with competing
firms in the rest of the world. [Labor is priced in the domestic
currency, while **capital is priced in dollars**. After a devaluation,
the relative cost of labor declines in the crisis country]{.underline},
so firms there are able to increase output and profits. In the long
term, however**[, the devaluation increases the cost of capital for
firms in the crisis country, possibly by more than the exchange-rate
movement, if there is an increase in domestic risk or if interest rates
rise.]{.underline}** [**If the firm has a high enough capital/labor
ratio, then the increased cost of capital could outweigh any benefit
from the cheaper labor.** For competing firms in the rest of the
world]{.underline}, analysis predicts the opposite results. **[In the
short run, output and profits decline]{.underline}**. Depending on the
use of capital and labor by foreign firms, however, the devaluation
could increase their output, profits, and investment in the long run.
Next Forbes gathers data for 1,100 firms around the world across ten
commodity industries, including natural rubber and forest products,
mining, natural gas and crude petroleum, fruits and vegetables, edible
oils and fats, cigarettes, industrial chemicals, plastics, materials and
synthetics, and fertilizers. [The data include firms from eight
countries that experienced \"major devaluations\" \-- defined as cases
in which the local currency depreciates against the U.S. dollar by 15
percent]{.underline} or more within any four-week period \-- from
January 1997 through December 1999. Forbes\'s results show that,
immediately following devaluations, firms in the crisis countries
expanded their output by an average of 21 percent, compared to output
growth of 8 percent in non-devaluing countries. Profits following
devaluations followed a similar pattern, growing by 23 percent in
devaluing countries versus 8 percent in non-devaluing nations. For
example, among edible oils and fats firms, production and profits
expanded by 16 percent and 17 percent, respectively, in crisis
economies, compared to 4 percent and negative 1 percent in the rest of
the world. Forbes\' analysis had predicted that, following a
devaluation, **[firms in the devaluing economy increase capital
investment while competing firms abroad reduce capital
investment,]{.underline}** if two conditions are met: first, i[f
labor\'s share in output is large compared to capital\'s share; and
second, if the increase in interest rates is small in the devaluing
country]{.underline}. In other words, **[the impact on capital
investment depends on the firms\' capital/labor ratio]{.underline}** and
on the price of capital. Here the data also tend to support her
predictions. Forbes divides the sample of firms from crisis countries
into two groups, based on whether their capital/labor ratio exceeds the
mean ratio for all firms in devaluing countries. **[Firms with higher
ratios have slower capital growth rates than firms with lower
capital/labor ratios]{.underline}**. The data also reveal that
\"devaluing country firms with low capital/labor ratios and no
significant increase in interest rates had the highest investment growth
(15 percent), while [firms with high capital/labor ratios and a large
increase in interest rates had the slowest investment growth (10
percent).\"]{.underline} Finally, Forbes uses stock price data to assess
whether expectations of long-run profits fit her predictions. After
devaluations, commodity-exporting firms in the devaluing countries
should have higher long-run profits than competing foreign firms if,
again, labor\'s share in output is large relative to capital and the
increase in the cost of capital is low. Forbes examines the average
3-month return starting in the month prior to the devaluation and ending
in the month following the devaluation, and finds that **[firms with
higher capital/labor ratios showed an average return of negative 34
percent, while the return for companies with lower ratios was negative
21 percent. \"]{.underline}**Although the majority of firms experienced
negative returns during this period,\" Forbes writes, \"these statistics
suggest that investors expected profits for more labor-intensive firms
to be less adversely affected by the devaluations than the profits of
more capital-intensive firms.\" Similarly, firms with lower
capital/labor ratios and that did not experience a large interest rate
increase showed the best 3-month average stock performance (negative 6
percent), while [firms with higher capital/labor ratios and high
interest rate increases displayed the worst performance (negative 29
percent).]{.underline} Ultimately, Forbes concludes that [a key factor
determining whether crisis-country firms benefit from devaluations is
whether the cost advantage from cheaper labor outweighs the disadvantage
from more expensive capital.]{.underline} \"The results could provide
important insights on why some devaluations boost exports, improve
economic growth, and spread to other countries,\" explains Forbes,
[\"while other devaluations have little effect on the trade balance, are
contractionary, and have minimal impact on the rest of the
world.\"]{.underline}

The unfortunate fact is, most people do truly deal in the present,
rarely questioning the future beyond what they consider to be the very
next event. The truth of this statement is borne out by the fact that
the great majority of people, who have already seen the first half of
the Great Unravelling come to pass, still somehow cannot imagine the
second half---the more disastrous half---as being in any way possible.
Surely, somehow, the governments of the world will fix things. However,
the number of people whose eyes have been opened seems to be growing,
and [many of them are asking what the collapse will look like as it
unfolds.]{.underline} What will the symptoms be? Well, the [primary
events are fairly predictable:]{.underline} they would include major
**[collapses in the bond and stock markets and possible sudden
deflation]{.underline}** (primarily of assets**[), followed by dramatic
inflation]{.underline}**, if not hyperinflation (primarily of
commodities), [followed by a crash of several major currencies,
particularly the euro and the US dollar.]{.underline} The [secondary
events will be]{.underline} less certain, but [likely: i**ncreased
unemployment, currency controls, protective tariffs, severe
depression**]{.underline}, etc. But, [along the way]{.underline}, there
will be numerous surprises---[actions taken by governments that may be
as unprecedented as they would be unlawful]{.underline}. Why? [Because,
again, **such actions are the norm when a government finds itself losing
its grip over the people it perceives as its minions.**]{.underline}
Here are a few: **[Travel Restrictions]{.underline}**. This will [begin
with restrictions on foreign travel, including suspension/removal of
passports]{.underline}. (This has begun in a small way in both the EU
and US.) Later, travel restrictions will be extended within the
boundaries of countries (highway checkpoints, etc.) [Confiscation of
wealth]{.underline}. The EU has instituted the confiscation of bank
accounts, which can be expected to become an international form of
governmental theft. This does not automatically mean that other assets,
such as precious metals and real estate will also be confiscated, but it
does mean that the barrier for confiscation has been eliminated. [There
is therefore no reason to assume that any asset is safe from any
government that approves theft through bail-ins.]{.underline} **[Food
Shortages. The food industry operates on very small profit margins and
survives only as a result of quick payment of invoices.]{.underline}**
[With dramatic inflation, marginal businesses (suppliers, wholesalers,
and retailers)]{.underline} [will fall by the wayside]{.underline}. The
percentage of failing businesses will be dependent upon the duration and
severity of the inflationary trend. [Squatters Rebellions]{.underline}.
[A dramatic increase in the number of **home and business foreclosures
will result in homelessness** for anyone whose debt exceeds his ability
to pay]{.underline}---even those who presently appear to be well-off. As
numbers rise significantly**[, a new homeless class will be created
amongst the former middle class]{.underline}**. As they become more
numerous, large scale ownership of property may give way to large scale
\"possession\" of property. [**Riots.** These will likely happen
spontaneously due to the above conditions, but if not, governments will
create them **to justify their desire for greater control of the masses.
Martial Law**.]{.underline} The [US has already prepared for this, with
the passing of the 2012]{.underline} National Defense Authorization Act
([NDAA)]{.underline}, which many interpret as declaring the US to be a
\"battlefield.\" **[The NDAA allows the suspension of habeas corpus,
indefinite detention, and the assumption that any resident may be
considered an enemy combatant]{.underline}**. Similar legislation may be
expected in other countries that perceive martial law as a solution to
civil unrest. The above list is purposely brief---a sampling of
eventualities that, should they occur, will almost definitely come
unannounced[. As the decline unfolds, they will surely happen with
greater frequency.]{.underline}

#### Rapid devaluation creates economic collapses through hyperinflation. That causes mass social unrest, poverty, high food prices, and homelessness

Blog \["How To Be Prepared For Economic Collapse," *National Debt
Relief*, 3-7-2018, URL:

DTS

What's an economic collapse? [A collapse of the U.S. economy could
manifest in many different forms, and be caused by a variety of
events]{.underline}. Generally, **[we would see a significant downturn
that could last for quite some time.]{.underline}** [**Poverty would be
rampant, which could lead to significant social unrest**. This downturn
could range]{.underline} anywhere **[from a big, deep recession to a
complete collapse, which would end daily life as we know]{.underline}**
it. As stated, this is highly unlikely; however, you should make
preparations anyway. What would cause the economy to collapse? Several
scenarios could cause a significant downturn in the U.S. or even the
world economy. Understanding the impacts of some of these might help you
better prepare. Three examples are as follows. A cyber attack that
paralyzes or severely damages the Internet could have a devastating
effect on commerce, banking, transportation, and anything that relies on
the Web to run. **[A rapid devaluation of the U.S. dollar could drive
the cost of goods sky high along with interest rates. Hyperinflation is
a significant threat to the health of the U.S economy.]{.underline}** A
terrorist attack of large magnitude, say a rogue country setting off an
EMP (electromagnetic pulse) that cripples the power grid and creates
significant chaos. Without power, things could deteriorate very rapidly.
Access to the basics of clean water and food for many people could be
severely impacted. How should I prepare? If a significant economic
downturn happens here, [it could happen quickly, especially if it's a
true collapse of the economy]{.underline}. So, you should prepare now
because you may not have a lot of time once it starts. [Consider what
happened when the economy teetered on the edge of collapse in
2008.]{.underline} In September of that year, [the economy nearly
collapsed as the stock market plunged and investors spiraled into a
full-blown panic, withdrawing billions from money market accounts, the
place where businesses store their operating capital]{.underline}. Had
this panic continued for several more days, the U.S. economy could have
ground to a complete halt, ceasing all commerce. **[Food shortages would
have happened very quickly along with shortages of other essential
items.]{.underline}** However, our financial leaders were able to stave
off a collapse by quickly implementing a bailout plan, which pumped
enough cash into the economy to keep it afloat. While the Great
Recession that ensued in 2008 was bad, [it could have been
catastrophic.]{.underline} [The Great Depression was precipitated by the
stock market crash]{.underline} that occurred on Thursday, October 24,
1929. By the following Tuesday, the [**market had lost 25% of its value.
Many Americans lost everything they had in those few short days.** The
stock market took decades to recover.]{.underline} You should prepare on
a number of fronts by stocking up on essentials, much as Americans who
live in hurricane-prone areas do. However, you should also prepare
financially. Let's examine a few areas you should focus on and some of
the specifics of getting prepared. Prepare financially In order to be
prepared financially, you must first be aware of what's happening in the
financial world. Because an economic collapse can happen very quickly,
it's important that you understand the basics of the U.S. economy so you
can recognize the signs of an impending downturn. [Monitor the stock
market, because a crash is usually one of the first signs that the
economy is faltering.]{.underline} Also, make sure you have some
liquidity in your assets, meaning you can convert them to cash quickly.
Start and maintain an emergency fund [One of the first things that'll
happen in a severe economic down or collapse is massive job
loss]{.underline}. If you don't have the financial ability to weather
being unemployed for a period, you'll be at risk of losing everything.
You should work toward accumulating enough cash to cover your expenses
for six months. Create a separate account for your emergency funds by
opening an interest-bearing checking or savings account, a certificate
of deposit, or a money market account. As a hedge against a complete
collapse, consider stockpiling items that could be used for bartering
such as alcohol, tobacco, coffee, and gold and silver. It's also a good
idea to keep some cash on hand in a safe place. Access to funds in a
bank or with an investment house could be difficult to access or become
hard to liquidate. Keep the money on hand in a precious metal if you
can. This [will protect you from currency devaluation in an economic
collapse.]{.underline} Create multiple streams of income Find ways to
generate excess income such as starting a side business or developing
other ways to earn income. If an economic downturn causes you to lose
your job, this could help close the gap on meeting your expenses and
surviving economically, as finding another good-paying job during a
recession or a depression could prove to be very difficult. A side
business can mean anything from starting an online business to selling a
homemade item at your local flea market or farmer's market. Also, work
to formulate some moneymaking methods by anticipating the needs and
wants of others during a financial crisis or collapse. **[Think in terms
of the absence of critical items and services, such as clean water,
food, medical supplies, and clothing.]{.underline}** Reduce or eliminate
your debt Having less to pay for each month will help you significantly
if you're laid off during a deep recession or economic collapse. In
addition, [if interest rates go way up during a significant economic
downturn, you'll reduce your exposure if you aren't carrying a lot of
credit card or other consumer debt.]{.underline} To help pay off your
debt, you should create a budget that funnels as much money to your debt
as possible. You can do this by reducing your overhead expenses and/or
increasing your income. Go through all your monthly bills and look to
reduce them down as much as possible. Cutting down the cable, telephone,
wireless, and subscription services all offer ways to save money.
Starting a side business or taking on a second job can help create
additional cash flow that you can put toward paying down your debt. It's
also important to develop a plan to pay off your debt. There are several
ways to consider; however, they all involve dedication and persistence.
You can start with your lowest balance first and work to pay that off,
and then move to your next highest, and so on. This helps you build
momentum in paying off your debt and creates a snowball effect, as each
month the amount of cash flow available to put toward paying down your
debts increases. Another way is to use the ladder method, which involves
paying off your debt in order of interest rate, starting with the
highest rate first. This will save you the most amount of money in the
end. Whatever method you choose, it'll be tough; you'll need to stay
dedicated to the idea of becoming debt free. Store essential items
[Being prepared for an economic collapse means having on hand essential
items you'll need to get you through until things begin to
normalize.]{.underline} This is similar to preparing for a hurricane but
on a larger scale. Store emergency water It's possible in an emergency
such as an economic collapse that **[you may be without water and
electricity for an extended time. Clean water is the most important
thing you'll need for survival.]{.underline}** For your convenience,
store as much water as you can, but also be prepared to sanitize water
in case the outage lasts for a long time. There are several options for
this, from chemicals to filters. Be sure to research your options,
decide on a method, and put it with your supplies. You'll need to store
or produce a minimum of a gallon of water per day, per person. In
addition, you'll need to include pets and livestock in your equation.
Stockpile emergency food You'll need to accumulate stores of nutritious,
non-perishable food that has a long shelf life. Items such as rice,
beans, canned foods, beef jerky, dried foods, and nuts are all good
options. Numerous resources online can help you decide which foods to
store. Essentials such as salt, sugar, coffee, honey, and powdered milk
are usually included. Try to stay away from processed foods and snack
items, which usually have a short shelf life. Think about the
nutritional needs of your family, especially those that require a
specific diet such as babies or diabetics. Also, don't forget to store
food for your pets as well. Grow a garden Cultivating a garden will
provide you with fresh, nutritious food [in the event of extended food
shortages]{.underline}. It'll also help you save money on [food costs if
the economy is experiencing hyperinflation]{.underline}. A garden also
provides you with the opportunity to preserve nutritious food through
canning and drying. Most items you grow in the garden can be canned and
stored for years.

Scientists believe [existing and emerging technologies hold]{.underline}
the [power to minimize]{.underline} the [costs of climate change and
**preserve the foundations of global economic and political
stability**]{.underline}. But [to ensure this]{.underline}, [we need
to]{.underline} muster the will and foresight to [develop and implement
carbon emission-reducing technologies now]{.underline}, and we need to
do it on a large scale.35 [Doing so will]{.underline} mean we can not
only **[meet our obligations under the Paris climate
accords]{.underline}** but also position ourselves as a leading seller
and servicer of efficient energy technologies on a global scale.
Estimates of the current and potential size of the global green
technology sector vary widely, but all suggest an international market
of several trillion dollars over the next two decades, and many
multiples of that over the course of the 21st century.36 Unfortunately,
[as in other infrastructure arenas]{.underline}, our [**continuing
reliance on private parties** to make publicly beneficial investments
has **failed**]{.underline} us [on green tech]{.underline}. It is simply
not economically rational for individual people, households, or firms to
incur costs to prevent climate change. But [if these investments are not
made, we will all suffer]{.underline}. In this sense, the world's
climate is the ultimate public good. **[National investment can further
fuel innovation in green technologies]{.underline}**, which will help
the U.S. be competitive in this growing sector globally. But to succeed,
we need to invest with both scale and speed. Accordingly, we propose
[game-changing public investments in commercial and industrial building
retrofits]{.underline}, in [a power grid that produces radically lower
carbon emissions, in more efficient roads and air transport systems, and
in alternative fuels and vehicles with high fuel
efficiency]{.underline}.i These investments [will create good jobs and
position the United States as the leader of a **global technological
revolution**, which will]{.underline} help [**revive U.S.
manufacturing**, and]{.underline} -- perhaps most importantly---[place
us on a trajectory to **meet the carbon reduction goals we must in order
to avoid catastrophe**]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- Impact -- Competitiveness

#### Infrastructure spending's key to [competitiveness]{.underline} and provides immediate stimulus that reverses [current stagnation]{.underline}

[In addition to improving]{.underline} our **[current and future
economic competitiveness]{.underline}**, as we have detailed in the
previous sections, [large-scale infrastructure investment would serve
a]{.underline} more immediate purpose: It would provide a [**much-needed
boost to demand** and help to]{.underline} [correct our current path of
**post-crisis stagnation**]{.underline}. More than eight years after the
financial crisis and more than six years since the official end of the
Great Recession, [the United States economy remains far from
recovered]{.underline}. Despite some labor market progress, the
[employment-to-population ratio still sits under 60
percent]{.underline}, nearly four percentage points below its pre-crisis
level and more than five percentage points below its year 2000 record of
64.7 percent.60 In its 2013 study of the U.S. recovery, the
International Monetary Fund estimated that [potential GDP remained 7
percent below its precrisis trajectory]{.underline}.61 Correcting this
would have required 4.3 percent annual growth through the end of 2016,
according to the Dallas Federal Reserve, but the actual rate has been
less than half that.62 [Economists from both groups, in addition to the
OECD,]{.underline} [all found strong justification for large-scale
public investment to **stimulate the economy and boost demand**, and
warned of the danger of premature budget tightening]{.underline},
pointing to the [poor economic record of the EU in the aftermath of
fiscal austerity.]{.underline}63 Furthermore, [there is a significant
body of economic research that shows the beneficial effects of public
infrastructure investment**, especially in times of
recovery.**]{.underline} The Congressional Budget Office estimated that
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), which is just a
fraction the size and scale of the long-term agenda proposed here,
created as many as 4.6 million jobs through 2011, while another study by
the White House Council of Economic Advisors found that [infrastructure
spending has one of the highest multipliers of any form of government
spending]{.underline}, along with food stamps and unemployment
insurance. An independent study from Dartmouth estimated that the
economic benefits of ARRA infrastructure investments were roughly double
what the government spent.64 [The infrastructure agenda outlined here
would create jobs on a much larger scale than the ARRA over a much
longer period of time]{.underline}. At a ratio of one job per year per
\$100,000 in investment, the \$400--\$500 billion annual [combined
public and private investment would]{.underline} directly [**create
between 4 and 5 million jobs** for 10 years]{.underline}. Using the
Economic Policy Institute's model for a somewhat smaller program, which
applied a conservative 1.6 GDP multiplier, the [GDP impact]{.underline}
of this program [would be between \$640 and \$800
billion]{.underline}---equivalent to 0.35--0.44 percent of GDP---and
[total job creation would be 5.4 million jobs per year of the
program]{.underline}. This would imply a reduction in the unemployment
rate of between 3 and 4 percent. Measured against a baseline nominal
unemployment rate of 5.3 percent, [this would create substantial
incentives for employers to raise wages in order to tap into long-term
unemployed and under-employed populations as well as the low wage
workforce]{.underline}.65 If funded as we recommend, using the federal
government's long-term borrowing capacity for the public portion of the
investments and using federal credit subsidy to support private
investments, and with most of the interest and principal paid through
progressive reforms to the U.S. tax structure, [the total employment
gain would still be in the range of 4 million jobs per year over 10
years. Since the end of the summer of 2015, the **signs of weakness in
the global economy have been growing**]{.underline}, ranging [from
capital market instability to negative interest rates in major
economies]{.underline} such as Japan's. [Large-scale infrastructure
investment]{.underline}, paid for by long-term federal borrowing, [would
be among the most effective policy initiatives available to
**counteract**]{.underline} the effect of **[global headwinds on the
U.S. economy]{.underline}**.

#### Competitiveness prevents global great power wars 

Elbridge **Colby 14**, the Robert M. Gates fellow at the Center for a
New American Security; and Paul Lettow, was senior director for
strategic planning on the U.S. National Security Council staff from 2007
to 2009, 7/3/14, "Have We Hit Peak America?,"
http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/07/03/have_we_hit_peak_america

Many [foreign-policy experts]{.underline} seem to [believe]{.underline}
that [retaining American primacy is]{.underline} largely [a matter of
will \-- of how America chooses to exert its power]{.underline} abroad.
Even President Obama, more often accused of being a prophet of decline
than a booster of America\'s future, recently asserted that the United
States \"has rarely been stronger relative to the rest of the world.\"
The question, he continued, is \"not whether America will lead, but how
we will lead.\"

[But [will is unavailing without strength]{.mark}. [If the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[wants
the]{.mark} international [system to]{.mark} continue to [reflect its
interests]{.mark} and values]{.underline} \-- [a system]{.underline},
for example, [[in which]{.mark} the global commons are protected, trade
is broad-based and extensive, and]{.underline} [[armed conflicts among
great nations are curtailed]{.underline}]{.mark} \-- [[it needs to
sustain]{.mark} not just resolve, but [relative power]{.mark}.
That]{.underline}, in turn, [will require acknowledging]{.underline} the
uncomfortable truth [that]{.underline} [[global power and wealth are
shifting]{.mark} at an unprecedented pace]{.underline}, with profound
implications. Moreover, many of the challenges America faces are
exacerbated by vulnerabilities that are largely self-created, chief
among them fiscal policy. Much more quickly and comprehensively than is
understood, those vulnerabilities are reducing America\'s freedom of
action and its ability to influence others.

[[Preserving America\'s]{.mark} international [position
will]{.mark}]{.underline} [[require]{.mark} it to restore its [economic
vitality]{.mark}]{.underline} and make policy choices now that pay
dividends for decades to come. America has to prioritize and to act.
Fortunately, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [still enjoys
greater freedom to determine its future than any other major
power]{.underline}, in part [because many of [its problems are within
its ability to address]{.mark}. But]{.underline} this process of
[[renewal must begin with]{.mark} analyzing]{.underline} [[America\'s
competitive position]{.underline}]{.mark} [and understanding the gravity
of the situation]{.underline} Americans face.

### 2NC -- Impact -- South Korea

#### Rapid devaluation in South Korea collapses investment and consumer spending.

"Weakening won poses new risks to Korean economy," *the Korean Herald*,

**[The weakening of the won in recent weeks carries both benefits and
risks for the Korean economy that is being held back by a simultaneous
downturn in investment, consumption and exports.]{.underline}**
Policymakers therefore face a thorny task to take proper steps in
response to the weakening won that is set to have contradictory effects
on the economy. [The value of the Korean currency against the dollar
fell]{.underline} to an eight-month low of 1,124.2 won per dollar [in
the Seoul foreign exchange market]{.underline} on June 28 before rising
somewhat to 1,114.5 won the following day. Over the previous 14 trading
days, the won lost its value against the greenback by 5.1 percent.
[Under usual conditions, the depreciation of the won can be seen as
bringing more positive than negative effects]{.underline} to Korea's
export-dependent economy by enhancing the price competitiveness of the
country's exporters. **[What is concerning, analysts note, is the steep
pace with which the won has been weakening.]{.underline}** A comparison
by Bloomberg of changes in the value of 20 major currencies against the
dollar from May 31 to June 26 showed [the won depreciated at the
third-fastest pace of 3.32 percent.]{.underline} The Argentine peso and
South African rand were the only two currencies that lost more value
than the won. The Turkish lira and Brazilian real depreciated 1.91
percent and 2.05 percent, respectively, against the greenback. While the
currency volatilities that hit most emerging economies earlier this year
have lessened, [the won is now in tune with the trend of depreciation
against the dollar after remaining relatively strong partly due to
reduced geopolitical risks on the Korean Peninsula.]{.underline}
According to data from the Bank of Korea, day-to-day changes in the
won-dollar exchange rate widened from an average 0.34 percent in May to
an average 0.44 percent during the period of June 1-27. Analysts note a
set of factors will likely precipitate the weakening of the won down the
road, ca[lling for measures to prevent a possible massive outflow of
capital from the country.]{.underline} "The won could weaken to 1,150
won per dollar within the year, if the trade tensions between the US and
China continue to intensify," said Ha Kun-hyung, an economist at Shinhan
Investment Corp. [China's move to devalue the yuan against the dollar to
counter President Donald Trump's trade pressure has served to push down
the value of the won against the greenback in recent weeks.]{.underline}
Experts note the local currency market is increasingly synchronized with
the yuan's movement as Korea depends on the [Chinese market for nearly a
quarter of its goods shipments abroad.]{.underline} Concerns are growing
that the escalating trade friction between the world's two-biggest
economies will weigh on the country's exports. According to government
data released Sunday, [Korea's outbound shipments dropped 0.9 percent
from a year earlier in]{.underline} June, marking the second monthly
decrease this year following a 1.5 percent dip in April. A recent study
by the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade forecast that
[the rate of on-year growth in the country's exports would slide from
15.6 percent last year to 6 percent this year.]{.underline} **[The
prospect of a slowdown in exports coupled with deteriorating profits of
Korea's major companies has prompted foreign investors to sell off
Korean shares.]{.underline}** Foreign investors have net-sold 3.8
trillion won (\$3.4 billion) worth of Korean shares so far this year \--
nearly 1.6 trillion won in June alone. ["One of the fundamental reasons
for the capital outflow is the weakening of confidence in local
companies' long-term profitability]{.underline}," said Lee Jae-man, an
analyst at Hana Financial Investment. According to FnGuide, a financial
information provider, the latest estimate of the combined operating
profits of 132 major listed firms in the second quarter of the year
reached 46.2 trillion won, down 8 percent from the 50.2 trillion won
forecast at the start of the year. [A widening gap between interest
rates in Korea and the US may also add to accelerating the capital
outflow.]{.underline} Policymakers seem ready to let the won continue to
weaken. "At some point, measures may need to be taken to stabilize the
market," said a Finance Ministry official, asking not to be named. But
he added it would not be worrisome that the value of the won might fall
further below the current level. Pressured by the US and the
International Monetary Fund, Seoul announced last month it would begin
disclosing records on currency market interventions next year. It may
well expect measures to push up the value of the won will not be subject
to punitive action from the US, [which has focused on curbing moves by
trading partners to devalue their currencies to help bolster
exports.]{.underline} [What concerns policymakers is the possibility
that the weakening won will be coupled with rising international oil
prices to raise inflation.]{.underline} [Korea's consumer price
hikes,]{.underline} which remained at 1 percent in January, [reached 1.6
percent]{.underline} in April and 1.5 percent in May. The upward trend
in prices may lead the BOK to increase its base rate, which has been
held at 1.5 percent since November. The move may also be needed to
narrow the rate gap with the US but would run [the risk of further
dampening domestic consumption and investment.]{.underline} According to
recent data from Statistics Korea, the country's [retail sales and
facility investment decreased]{.underline} 1 percent and 3.2 percent
on-month in May, respectively, marking the second and [third monthly
decline in a row.]{.underline}
