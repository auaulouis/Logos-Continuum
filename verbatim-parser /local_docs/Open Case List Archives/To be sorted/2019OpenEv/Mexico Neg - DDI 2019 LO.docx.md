## Cartels Inevitable

### Crackdown impossible

#### Drug trafficking has grown in Mexico despite billions in US aid.

at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Mexico's Drug
War"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/mexicos-drug-war

[**Mexican authorities have been waging a war against drug trafficking
organizations for more than a decade,** but with limited
success]{.underline}. Thousands of Mexicans, including politicians,
students, and journalists, continue to die in the conflict every year.
In 2018, homicides hit a new high at more than twenty-eight thousand;
many were linked to drug cartels**[. Successive U.S. administrations
have partnered closely with Mexico in this fight, providing billions of
dollars for Mexico to modernize its security forces]{.underline}**,
reform its judicial system, and make other investments. Washington has
also sought to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the United States by
bolstering security on its southern border, although a debate has flared
over the utility of expanding the physical barrier there.

#### Institutional corruption means cartel driven violence continues despite increases in spending.

analyst specializing in correspondence regarding Mexican politics.
"Mexico's Astonishing Costs of Fighting Drug Cartels have not Reduced
Violence"

year [Mexico's peacekeeping price tag is believed to be the highest
ever.]{.underline} To put things in perspective, [\$172.7 billion is
significantly more than twice Mexico's foreign debt]{.underline} of
\$73.5 billion, according to data from Mexico's Ministry of Finance.
[**Yet violence and homicides have not diminished significantly**, **due
in large part**, as the report points out**, to the country's endemic
corruption and institutional weakness**]{.underline}**.** In this year's
IEP's Global Peace Index, Mexico's rank "slightly deteriorated",
dropping from 133 to 138 (out of 162 countries), with Iceland, Denmark
and Austria being the top three most peaceful, and South Sudan,
Afghanistan and Syria the least peaceful countries.[Violence containment
spending is defined by the IEP as economic activity that is related to
the consequences or prevention of violence where the violence is
directed against people or property.]{.underline} IEP's methodology
values thirteen different dimensions: military expenditure homicides;
internal security; violent crime; private security; incarceration; GDP
losses from conflict; deaths from internal conflict; fear; terrorism; UN
peacekeeping; internally displaced persons and refugees, and deaths from
external conflict of violence.

#### Cartels inevitable -- convictions only cause new rivalries and violence.

Kevin **McCoy**. 2- 22 -- **19.** Kevin McCoy is a USA Today contributor
whose expertise is at the intersection of finance and politics. "After
El Chapo: Sinaloa, other Mexican drug cartels still strong, and now
diversifying".

But analysts and researchers on Mexican crime organizations that the
actual impact on the transnational drug trade might be minimal.
**[The]{.underline}** Sinaloa **[cartel remains a strong drug-smuggling
and violence threat on both sides of
the Southwest Borde]{.underline}**r, they say, and [a newer, rival crime
group]{.underline}, the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación, [poses
similar danger]{.underline}. \"**The conviction is a great moral victory
for the United States**, Mexico and other countries that have been
severely damaged by the flow of illegal drugs coming from the flow of
Chapo Guzmán and the Sinaloa cartel,\" said [Mike
Vigil](http://www.missionessential.com/our-people/mike-vigil/), a former
chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration. [**The unfortunate aspect is that the** Sinaloa **cartel
continues to function and is just as powerful,\"**]{.underline} Vigil
said.

#### Cartels inevitable -- lack of police and internal corruption makes crack down impossible.

Ciara **Nugent**. 6 -- 28 -- **18.** Ciara Nugent is an international
reporter for TIME magazine. "Mexico is Suffering it's Bloodiest War In
Modern History. Here's Why".
https://time.com/5324888/mexico-violence-murders/

[Mexico suffers from a chronic police shortage]{.underline}, with
[116,000 positions
unfilled](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/Insuficientes-los-policias-en-Mexico--20171227-0093.html)
around the country. The Government Security Agency says **[Mexico only
has around half of the police it needs right now.]{.underline}** A key
reason for that is low pay; local police forces in Mexico [earn an
average of \$460 a
month](https://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/04/07/mapa-los-policias-mexicanos-con-menor-y-mayor-salario_a_22029361/),
slightly less than the national average wage. "The police career is not
a professional one," Gerardo Rodríguez, a professor in security at the
University of the Americas, tells TIME. "Who would want to be on the
front line against the drug cartels if there is no professional career
or sufficient payment or support for them and for their families? That's
the reason local governments are relying on the Mexican army to be in
the streets right now." Troops have been serving as police since
December 2006, when then-president Felipe Calderon launched a crackdown
on drug cartels. In December 2017 lawmakers passed an "interior security
law" giving them an official role in policing. Human rights groups
[criticised the
move](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/mexican-military-police-drugs-crackdown-human-rights),
saying the army were not properly trained in dealing with civilians.2.
Gangs have fragmented, and moved into new areasSince the crackdown on
cartels began[, many important drug kingpins have been arrested**,
leaving gangs to fight among themselves and fragment.** **That has lead
to more, smaller gangs who are competing over the existing drug trade
infrastructure**]{.underline} -- such as transit passes and good sites
for building laboratories. Faced with that competition, gangs are being
driven to diversify their business. The famous Sinaloa cartel, for
example, has invested heavily in the production of fentanyl, a new
synthetic opioid considered to be [25-50 times stronger than
heroin.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/d4b32e27-8e5c-4a25-b833-e25b5657f87e)
"[The issue of organized crime in Mexico has really evolved -- it's no
longer only drug trafficking groups but also gangs with other
origins,"]{.underline} says Rubén Salazar, the director of
[Etellekt](http://www.etellekt.com/). Many gangs now make money by
robbing freight trains and extorting money from civilians, both of which
increase the potential for violence, as does another recent criminal
trend in Mexico: the illegal extraction of oil, or "huachicoleo", a
phenomenon that has gone up by 790% in the last five years, according to
[state oil company
Pemex](https://www.animalpolitico.com/2018/02/combustible-robo-epn/).
They say a pipeline is illegally tapped somewhere in the country every
90 minutes. People siphon off oil, transport it and resell it, employing
and implicating large numbers of people in criminal networks in the
process. 3. Corruption means political killings are spiraling [The
arrest in June 2017 of twelve mayors from Puebla state on suspicion of
involvement in a fuel-stealing ring exposed another worrying facet of
Mexico's security problem -- the infiltration of criminal elements in
local politics]{.underline}. Salazar says **[this has lead to a surge in
political violence.]{.underline}** "The number of attacks against
against politicians went up by more than 2400% between 2012 and 2018,"
he says. "The vast majority were aimed at local politicians." Salazar
says **[the federal government in Mexico has lost control of local
governments, leaving local politicians to get involved in criminal
activities]{.underline}**. "These local powers are trying to transform
themselves into practically feudal states," he says. "What we are seeing
at the moment is a deliberate employment of violence as a political
tool, as not only organized crime groups but also local political groups
try to perpetuate themselves in power, controlling government
structures, as well as lands and both legal and illegal activities,
through violence." On June 25, the entire police force of the town of
Ocampo was [disarmed and detained by state
police](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/mexico-detains-entire-police-force-days-after-mayoral-candidate-s-n886451),
on suspicion of having orchestrated the murder of a mayoral candidate.
"[This is very serious because it could throw the quality of Mexico's
democratic governance into question]{.underline}," warns Salazar. "What
could happen is the formation of authoritarian governments on a local
scale."4. A weak government ... and little prospect of change. Voters
are overwhelmingly dissatisfied with the state of Mexican security.
"Violence is the number one issue for voters, above the economy, above
inequality," says Rodríguez. "The federal system just isn't functioning
right now in Mexico."

#### Community police are vulnerable to corruption entrenching gang violence through a second sphere of conflict.

Mark **Stevenson.** 6 -- 21 -- **19.** Mark Stevenson is a contributor
to AP News. "Toxic mix of gangs, viglantes fuels rising Mexican
violence". https://www.apnews.com/0dd55be1b2814b60944fe87b2a105db4

It is a scene repeated over and over again in southern Mexico[**:
So-called "community police"** or "self-defense" groups**, often accused
of drug cartel ties themselves, have proliferated and extended their
control over territory**]{.underline}. And time after time, outnumbered
soldiers don't intervene, in part because they are afraid of opening
fire on civilians.Many had expected violence to taper off in Guerrero as
synthetic opioids like fentanyl knocked the bottom out of the opium
market that had fed organized crime groups in the state. In fact,
homicides in the notoriously violent state dropped by 36% in the first
three months of the year. [But **it now appears a new round of violence
is only starting, pitting warring gangs against vigilante squads
fighting over fuel theft, gold mines and routes for precursor
chemicals.**]{.underline} Thousands have been displaced by the fighting,
and the toxic mix of cartels, hired killers, vigilante police forces
have essentially neutralized the Mexican military, forcing troops into
the role of mere spectators, or worse, hostages.

### Increases violence -- more gangs

#### Attempts to take down cartels only result in splintering into more gangs -- that increases violence.

When I was in [Mexico](https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico) City
this spring, a month after the verdict, talk of the trial had already
died down. Guzmán's image had mostly disappeared from the magazine
covers on display at the news kiosks that dot the streets of the
capital. [While people could still name the Sinaloa cartel's leaders and
lieutenants, they were more interested in the newer
cartels]{.underline}, such as Jalisco Nueva Generación or the local La
Unión. Many people didn't want to discuss El Chapo at all. "Narco
fatigue" -- the exhaustion that comes with being oversaturated by news
and pop culture about the drug trade -- had long ago set in. **[Over the
past 13 years, Mexico's internal war on drugs has dominated the media,
resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people and failed to stop
narcotrafficking.]{.underline}** [Guzmán's arrest did not magically rid
Mexico, or the US, of violence or drugs.]{.underline} Above all, his
trial demonstrated how disposable any single person is in the larger
machinations of the narco-state. [**There has never been a clear
definition of** what exactly constitutes **a cartel, and as smaller,
more transient gangs replace larger organisations, going after leaders**
like Guzmán **seems increasingly pointless**]{.underline}. Rather than
reducing the levels of violence and trafficking in Mexico, that approach
-- **[the so-called kingpin strategy, employed by Mexico and the US --
has enabled new forms of crime to flourish]{.underline}**. As Ismael "El
Mayo" Zambada, Chapo's longtime partner, said in 2010 in a rare
[interview](https://www.proceso.com.mx/106967/proceso-en-la-guarida-de-el-mayo-zambada)
with the Mexican news magazine El Proceso, **[the problem of narcos
isn't going away]{.underline}**: "As soon as capos are locked up, killed
or extradited, their replacements are already around." **S**ince the
early 1990s, [the US has targeted cartels via their
leaders.]{.underline} It is a fairly straightforward idea: [take out the
head of an illegal organisation and the rest will collapse]{.underline}.
The approach was developed to bring down the Colombian cartels, and in
that case, it had some success. When Pablo Escobar was shot to death by
Colombian police in 1993, his cartel went down with him.[But even
as]{.underline} the structures of [organised crime have evolved, US law
enforcement has generally stuck to this top-down mode]{.underline}l. If
they are not killing drug lords, they are using the American judicial
system to make examples of them. Since 2001, when Mexico's supreme court
agreed to allow the extradition of criminals so long as they would not
face the death penalty or life in prison (this ruling was amended four
years later to permit life sentences), dozens of narcotraffickers have
been extradited to the US, including members of the Tijuana,
Beltrán-Leyva, Sinaloa and Los Zetas cartels. If Guzmán ends up in the
supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, as he is expected to, he will
share the facility with former Gulf cartel leader Osiel Cárdenas
Guillén. While Sinaloa has historically been, and still remains,
Mexico's most powerful cartel, the world it came up in no longer exists.
Between the early 90s and the mid-2000s, the Sinaloa, Tijuana, Juárez
and Gulf organisations were mini-monopolies, with borders that more or
less stayed the same. Then, with the start of Mexico's drug war in 2006,
that arrangement started to fall apart. **[As Mexican and American
authorities took out cartel leaders, groups fractured and new ones
emerged.]{.underline}**

#### War on drugs was a painful loss -- attempts at containment only increase the number of cartels and independent organizations.

[*Can Mexico win the war against drugs? **No*** .If winning means
eliminating all drug production, trade and consumption, then the only
honest answer is "no."]{.underline} The strategic lines drawn by the
Mexican government rely on "containment and weakening" criminal
organizations, not "elimination." [**Even if we assume a sharp reduction
in** the **consumption of drugs** **in the U**nited **S**tates,
**significant demand will remain, and supply will** most probably **come
from south of the border.**]{.underline} Of course, given the scale of
this illegal trade, relatively large and well-organized groups will be
required to meet demand. What can "winning the war" possibly mean, then?
It means the reduction of the main negative side effects of the trade:
violence and the weakening of the rule of law. Unfortunately, **[the
indicators of violence in Mexico force us to conclude that we have
painfully lost]{.underline}.** The national rate of homicides (per
100,000 inhabitants) moved from 8.4 in 2007 to 18.0 in 2009 (according
to the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics,
INEGI) or from 9.7 in 2007 to 15.0 in 2009 (according to the National
System for National Security, SNSP). But in the eight states in which
federal and local forces ran joint operations against criminal
organizations, the 2007--2009 changes went from 12.8 to 41.3 (INEGI
data) or from 15.9 to 34.5 (SNSP) per 100,000. I recently estimated
that, due to these joint operations, homicides in those states increased
by 12,000 between 2007 and 2010 (*Nexos*, June 2011). Eighty-five
municipalities account for 70 percent of total homicides in Mexico, but
the increase has been broader: the number of Mexicans living in a
municipality with homicide rates above 50 per 100,000 people moved from
850,000 in 2007 to 9.1 million in 2009.^1^ For the last five years,
Mexicans have become experts at body counts, but we still are unable to
understand the causes of those deaths. Worse, [we have become accustomed
to seeing bodies, where we ought to be seeing lawful
prosecutions.]{.underline} This leads to the second side effect. Experts
and some government officials argue that the main goal of the strategy
started in 2007 was to dismantle big cartels and fragment them into
smaller cells so that they would not represent a serious threat. That
is, to turn a national security menace into a public security problem.
According to a study presented by Mexican security analyst Eduardo
Guerrero (*Nexos*, June 2011) **[the number of cartels in Mexico climbed
from six to 12]{.underline}** [between 2007 and 2010,]{.underline}
**[while the number of smaller local organizations increased from five
to 62 in the same period]{.underline}**. Intuitively, smaller
organizations face higher restrictions for trafficking large amounts of
drugs across the border, and consequently are forced to expand their
operations to other illegal activities: Mexico's rate of extortion
increased from 3.0 (per 100,000 inhabitants) in 2007 to 5.5 in 2010.
Kidnappings went from 0.4 to 1.2 (per 100,000 inhabitants). **[We are
trapped in a worst-case scenario: giant cartels such as Sinaloa continue
to be a threat and new, violent small cells are being created and
expanding the range of their criminal activities.]{.underline}**
Achieving the government's goal of transforming the national problem
into a series of local ones depends on the quality of local police---and
that is another serious problem. By December 2010, in 29 of Mexico's 32
states, less than 50 percent of state police officers had been subjected
to a Trust Test (*prueba de confianza*), which included polygraph and
drug tests to identify cops who likely were or would become accomplices
to criminals. Only two states have conducted such tests on more than 50
percent of their municipal police forces. Worse, as many as 65 percent
of the state and municipal officers who took those tests failed them,
leading national authorities to conclude that they may be linked to
criminal organizations.

#### Efforts to manage cartels only cause turf wars and increased violence.

War".https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/27861/can-amlo-end-mexico-s-drug-war

This close cooperation between the U.S. and Mexico has not resulted in
fewer drugs being trafficked into the United States or less crime in
Mexico. [**Although the U.S. and Mexico together took down the heads
of** several **major drug cartels, these cartels have since splintered,
causing turf wars and increased violence.**]{.underline} **[They have
also diversified their income streams]{.underline}** due to the
crackdown on drug smuggling, **[turning increasingly to fuel theft,
extortion and kidnapping---with the participation and collusion of
public security forces]{.underline}**. Homicide rates have surged across
Mexico, targeting politicians, police, military personnel, activists and
civilians. Since the drug war began in 2006, some [235,000 people have
been
murdered](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10714839.2018.1550981)
in Mexico, and over 37,000 have been officially identified as
disappeared. **["This militarized model has had a negative
effect]{.underline}** on civilians, many of whom have been direct
victims of human rights violations by the military or by police bodies,
and an even larger percentage of whom continue to live in fear of
criminal violence because [the use of force in the streets is not
actually effective at sustainably reducing overall violence or changing
structural causes of crime,"]{.underline} Stephanie Brewer, an attorney

human rights organization in Mexico City, writes in an email.

#### MEXICO CITY -- [The most fearsome weapons wielded by Mexico's drug cartels enter the country from Central America,]{.underline} not the United States, according to U.S. diplomatic cables disseminated by WikiLeaks and published on Tuesday by La Jornada newspaper. [Items such as grenades and rocket-launchers are stolen from Central American armies]{.underline} and smuggled into Mexico via neighboring Guatemala, the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City reported to Washington. The assertions appear in embassy cables written after three bilateral conferences on arms trafficking that took place between March 2009 and January 2010 in Cuernavaca, Mexico; Phoenix; and Tapachula, Mexico, respectively. The cables' authors note that Mexican officials and politicians never hesitate to remind U.S. diplomats that Mexico's drug war -- which has claimed 35,000 lives in the last four years -- is fueled by Americans' demand for illegal drugs and by guns bought in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Yet one of the cables maintains that [90 percent of the heavy armament Mexican security forces seize from cartel gunmen comes from Central America.]{.underline} The cable, which does not offer any particulars or supporting documentation, does acknowledge that the vast majority of the handguns and many of the assault rifles used by the cartels enter Mexico from the United States. A message drafted after the October 2009 conference in Tapachula blamed the Mexican government for not doing enough to patrol the southern border with Guatemala. Grenades give cartels retaliatory force that deters police officers.

**[Hand-lobbed grenades are unfortunately quite common]{.underline}**,

The Mexican army regularly seizes arsenals of small arms from
stockpiles, abandoned after firefights or concealed inside vehicles
driven by drug traffickers. In June, a \"[[narco
rebellion]{.underline}](http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/mexican-cartel-tactical-note-11)\"
in the border city of Piedras Negras resulted sporadic firefights
lasting hours. After it was over[, the military had turned up 50 AK-47
rifles, along with grenade launchers, various machine guns, shotguns and
bolt-action rifles.]{.underline} **[But the cartels are also getting
increasingly more powerful guns.]{.underline}** In March, firefights
between police and the Zetas netted both M-60 and a .30-caliber Browning
machine gun. \<ahref target=\"\_blank\"\>Sniper rifles and machine guns
up to the .50-caliber size have been discovered. The Mexican military
has even turned up a [German MG34 machine gun from World War
II](http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/mexican-cartel-tactical-note-11a).\</ahref\>
An open question [is where the cartels get their guns]{.underline}.
It\'s generally accepted the bulk come from two places: [[The United
States](https://www.wired.com/2012/11/cartel-weapons/stag-komodo.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/11/cartel)
and [Central
America](http://stag-komodo.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/marinesvszetas/)]{.underline}.
In April, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found [that 68,000
out of 99,000 guns [discovered in Mexico and submitted to the
ATF](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/atf-68000-guns-in-mexico-traced-to-us/2012/04/26/gIQAtSz9kT_story.html)
since 2007 originated in the United States. That\'s about 68 percent of
the total submitted for tracing]{.underline}. The subject is also
fraught with U.S. domestic politics, and was at the heart of the scandal
around the [ATF\'s botched Fast and Furious
operation](https://www.wired.com/2012/11/cartel-weapons/stag-komodo.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/09/gunwalking-plan/),
which resulted in an estimated 2,000 straw-purchased firearms being
smuggled into Mexico after purchase in Arizona gun stores.

#### Even if weapons are confiscated from cartels, corruption ensures they make their way back.

Insight. "Mexico how guns are trafficked below the
border".https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gunrunners-mexico/mexico/how-guns-are-trafficked.html

[**It\'s hard to know how much seized weaponry is recycled back into the
criminal enterprises through corrupt military and police** because the
numbers don\'t add up.]{.underline} U.S. officials say Mexico asks them
to trace less than 25 percent of the weapons decommissioned, which the
ATF says totals more than 70,000 weapons. This total, however, does not
correspond with the number of weapons the Mexicans say they have
decommissioned, which they estimate to be 93,000 since the beginning of
the Calderón administration. A former Mexican prosecutor, a U.S. law
enforcement officer and an international investigator all say **[Mexican
security forces intentionally don\'t keep an accurate
count.]{.underline}** That\'s because the sector of the security forces
involved in the weapons trade wants to resell seized ammunition and
weapons back to the cartels. And another sector of the security forces
would be embarrassed if it got out publicly that no one knows exactly
how many weapons or munitions have been decommissioned. The Mexican army
vehemently denies it is responsible for any recycling of weapons back
into the criminal networks. At a tour of its decommissioned weapons'
storage facility, Mexican Army General Antonio Erasto Monsivais Pinedo
said the army keeps very close tabs on all the weapons it seizes. He
says only 10 to 15 percent of the weapons decommissioned were recycled
back into use by the security forces. A small percentage, he added, went
to museums and the rest were destroyed. To prove his point, the general
showed two reporters how they destroyed them. [**Local law enforcement**
\-- in particular municipal and state police \-- **also seize many
weapons. Their accounting,** according to U.S. and Mexican intelligence
services**, may not be as rigorous as the army's.**]{.underline} One
U.S. agent tracking weapons in the region said many of **[these seizures
are never reported and simply filter back into the criminal networks or
are sold on the black market.]{.underline}**

### Police fail

#### Police officers fail -- easily coerced and always outgunned.

It can be a little deceiving to think of Mexico\'s drug cartels as
simply gangsters. Instead, they\'ve blurred boundaries between organized
crime and quasi-military insurgents, seized swathes of territory and
become some of the world\'s most dangerous criminal gangs. They\'ve also
acquired plenty of firepower to back it up. The Zetas are one of the
most disruptive and aggressive of them all. [Formed by ex-military men
who became armed enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,]{.underline} the Zetas
split with their former patrons nearly three years ago and have since
become [one of Mexico\'s largest and most dangerous
cartels](http://stag-komodo.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/zetas/). While
most of those ex-military founding fathers of the cartel are now dead or
in prison, [they\'ve retained a [culture of military
loyalties](http://stag-komodo.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/zetas-even-deadlier/),
if not so much the discipline and hierarchy]{.underline}. Or much in the
way of taste. In September, Mexican police arrested Ramiro Pozos, the
alleged leader of drug gang \"The Resistance\" and Zeta ally \-- with
his gold- and silver-plated AK-47. Meanwhile, coming up on Saturday,
[incoming president Enrique Pena
Nieto](http://stag-komodo.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/06/penanieto/) takes
office, the first change in the presidency since the drug war exploded
across the country more than six years ago. Aside from reducing the
level of violence, one of his priorities will be wrenching back control
of cartel territory, and putting it back under the control of the state.
It won\'t be easy. To enforce their claims, the Zetas --- and other
criminal groups like the Sinaloa Cartel and the Gulf Cartel --- [deploy
an extensive amount of hardware, nearly rivaling Mexico\'s own
military**. Police forces are often corrupted or threatened into
compliance, and almost always outgunned**]{.underline}. Here\'s a look
at seven examples why.

#### Cartels are developing new bombs that are capable of ambushing militaries.

Car bombs were uncommon among cartels only a few years ago, and are
normally associated in the country with Anarchists and left-wing
militant groups. Today, **[the bombs]{.underline}** are still relatively
rare, but **[have been showing up more in [ambushes on military
patrols](http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2011/10/monterrey-army-attacked-in-car-bomb.html).]{.underline}**
Car bombs have been repeatedly [[blown up outside newspaper offices and
police
stations]{.underline}](http://www.cpj.org/2012/03/in-mexico-two-media-outlets-attacked-within-a-week.php),
causing relatively few casualties but with the intent to terrorize and
intimidate. Sporadic car bombings have also occurred in the border city
of Nuevo Laredo, **[as rival drug gangs [fight over control of the
lucrative
turf](http://www.valleycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=745672#.ULV9PodUy4V).]{.underline}**
An open question is whether the cartels will take the route of the
infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar, who once used car bombs to inflict
mass casualties on the Colombian public. But Mexico\'s gangsters
haven\'t indicated they will so far, perhaps seeing it in their interest
to avoid bringing down too much heat from the authorities. An alleged
2009 Iranian-Zetas bomb plot to [kill the Saudi ambassador in
Washington](http://stag-komodo.wired.com/dangerroom/2011/10/iran-bomb-plot-true/)
was met with disbelief --- the alleged plotter was never confirmed to
have actually met with anyone from the Zetas. There\'s also a difference
between a \"[car
bomb](http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110413-perceived-car-bomb-threat-mexico)\"
and a bomb that happens to be placed in a car. Many vehicle-borne bombs
used by the cartels have been fairly small --- sometimes just a few
sticks of dynamite in a trunk --- compared to a large and powerful bomb
that could potentially level a building. But **[the cartels also appear
to be building more sophisticated bombs, and have been discovered with
military-grade mines]{.underline}**. In May, Mexican troops fought a
group of drug traffickers in the state of Zacatecas, killed three

John **Campbell**, 2-23-20**09**, \"Helping Mexico Help Itself,\"

https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/helping-mexico-help-itself

Mexico's **[President Felipe Calderon]{.underline}** has not taken the
growing power \-- and increasing violence \-- of the drug cartels
stoically. At the start of his term a little over two years ago, he
**[launched his own war on drugs, deploying over 30,000 military troops
in several states]{.underline}** to quell the violence and take back the
streets from narco-traffickers. He has pushed through legislation to
reform the judicial system and to revamp Mexico's intelligence gathering
and federal police forces. He opened an academy to train federal-level
police officers and instituted new evaluations to test police officer
honesty (in particular potential links to narco-traffickers).
\"**[Newspaper pundits have already dubbed the Mexican military's
anti-drug effort as 'Calderon's Iraq.'\" Calderon sees the increasing
violence and brazenness of the cartels in recent months as evidence that
the government's multipronged attack on the drug cartels is working. The
increased bloodletting is taken as a sign of cartel disorder and even
disintegration, as drug kingpins are arrested and \"business as usual\"
disrupted.]{.underline}** Others are less sure, seeing the growing
number and audacity of attacks as a threat to the very state. Newspaper
pundits have already dubbed the military effort as \"Calderon's Iraq.\"
While the vast majority of the public, according to opinion polls, lauds
Calderon for his efforts, they increasingly question whether the
president's campaign can succeed. Polls also show that most Mexicans
distrust the police, highlighting that the challenges to law and order
also come from within the government. At this juncture, it is still
unclear who will \"win\" this war on drugs. What is clear is the outcome
is vital to the United States, given that the two countries share the
most active border in the world (with over 500,000 crossings each day),
and that Mexico is the United States' second largest export market, our
third largest oil supplier, most significant source of immigrants, and
largest source of illegal drugs. Stirrings in 'El Norte' The broader
U.S. foreign policy community only recently woke up to this mounting
violence next door. Retiring CIA chief Michael Hayden stated in January
that Mexico could be as serious a challenge as Iran for the Obama
administration, and may be more problematic than Iraq. The U.S. Joint
Forces Command's \"Joint Operating Environment 2008\" depicts a rapid
and sudden collapse in Mexico (as well as Pakistan) as one of its
\"worst case scenarios\" \-- unlikely, but possible. Mexico's nefarious
criminal organizations have already infiltrated across the border. In
fact, the U.S. Justice Department identifies Mexican gangs as the
\"biggest organized crime threat to the United States.\" \"The U.S.
Joint Forces Command's \"Joint Operating Environment 2008\" depicts a
rapid and sudden collapse in Mexico (as well as Pakistan) as one of its
'worst case scenarios' -- unlikely, but possible.\" What can and should
the United States do? First, the United States should \"do no harm\" to
its southern neighbor. This, essentially, involves the United States
getting its own house in order and enforcing its own laws. U.S. gun laws
prohibit the sale of weapons and ammunition to foreign nationals or
\"straw buyers.\" They also forbid the unlicensed export of guns.
Nevertheless, the Mexican government and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) have tracked over 90 percent of the guns
used by the cartels in Mexico to U.S. gun shops and shows, most of them
within miles of the border. Enforcing U.S. gun laws and inspecting
traffic on the border going south \-- not just north \-- would help
reduce the tools of violence in Mexico. South-bound traffic inspections
would also hinder the smuggling of large amounts of cash from U.S. drug
sales. Estimates of these flows range widely, but most believe some \$15
billion to \$20 billion heads across the U.S. border into the hands of
Mexico's drug cartels each year. This number overwhelms the \$400
million in security-oriented funds the U.S. government provided to the
Mexican government for 2009 (until last year it was only \$40 million).
The successful CIA-based Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center, ramped
up in the years since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 to
thwart terrorist financing, should be replicated to go after
drug-related money. It is also time for the United States to shift the
emphasis of its drug policy toward demand reduction. Numerous studies
show that a dollar spent in the United States in the drug war is vastly
more effective than those put toward eradication and interdiction
abroad. Furthermore, a [study by RAND
(PDF)](http://www.rand.org/pubs/occasional_papers/2005/RAND_OP121.pdf)found
that, in the longer term, treatment is more than five times as effective
as conventional enforcement. By reducing the number of hardcore addicts
(and their willingness to pay almost anything for a fix), prevention and
treatment can lower the drug profits that buy guns, corrupt law
enforcement agents, and undermine the Mexican government**[. The United
States should also work with Mexico to tackle this mutual problem. Until
just last year, the United States provided less than \$40 million
dollars a year in security funding to its southern neighbor \-- in stark
contrast to the over \$500 million designated for Colombia. This changed
with the passage of the Merida Initiative last June, which provides
Mexico with \$1.4 billion worth of equipment, software, and technical
assistance over a three-year period. While an important corrective from
the past, the Merida Initiative cannot be the full extent of U.S.
involvement in Mexico's security. It needs to be just the start of a
more comprehensive program to the broader \-- and perhaps more
intractable problems \-- that Mexico faces.]{.underline}**

#### Merida Initiative good for beating back the cartels.

Ray **Walser**, 7-23-20**18**, \"Mexico, Drug Cartels, and the Merida
Initiative: A Fight We Cannot Afford to Lose,\" Heritage Foundation,
https://www.heritage.org/americas/report/mexico-drug-cartels-and-the-merida-initiative-fight-we-cannotafford-lose

**[The]{.underline}** Bush Administration\'s **[Merida
Initiative]{.underline}**---a three-year, \$1.5 billion anti-drug
assistance package for Mexico and Central America---**[is a quantitative
and qualitative jump in support for the drug fight in the
region.]{.underline}** Unlike Plan Colombia, which helped to rescue
Colombia from the throes of a narco-war, **[the Merida Initiative will
provide assistance in equipment, tech­nology, and training without a
significant U.S. military footprint in Mexico.]{.underline}** President
George W. Bush signed the Merida Initiative into law as part of the
Supplemen­tal Appropriations Act of 2008 on June 30,
2008.[\[1\]](https://www.heritage.org/americas/report/mexico-drug-cartels-and-the-merida-initiative-fight-we-cannotafford-lose#_ftn1)
In Mexico and in the press, the Merida Initiative is being viewed as a
critical test of U.S.--Mexican rela­tions. Its implementation will be
closely scrutinized on both sides of the aisle in Congress. The Merida
Ini­tiative could become an important legacy of the Bush presidency in
the Western Hemisphere **[and created a solid platform for U.S.--Mexican
coopera­tion]{.underline}** for the next Administration**[. The
initiative, however, is just a start. The U.S. needs to do
more]{.underline}** to secure the border, reduce the flows of illegal
arms and illicit cash south into Mex­ico, and alter immigration laws to
permit tempo­rary workers to cross the border legally to help fill the
U.S. demand for labor. Policymakers need to develop a comprehensive
strategy that covers all transit and source countries. **[Mexico needs
to continue exercising the political will to combat the deadly drug
cartels and continue reforming its judicial system, overhauling police
and law enforcement, and modernizing and devel­oping its
economy.]{.underline}** Finally, the Mexican government needs to take an
active role in preventing illegal third-country nationals from
transiting Mexican territory, as well as in closing down smuggling
orga­nizations that operate on Mexican soil and discourag­ing Mexican
citizens from entering the U.S. illegally. Both nations would benefit
substantially from a re­turn to law and order on both sides of the
border.

#### The Initiative is working to take down drug traffickers.

Erubiel **Tirado**, 12-8-20**16**, \"Mexico\'s war on drugs: what has it
achieved and how is the US involved?,\" Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/dec/08/mexico-war-on-drugs-cost-achievements-us-billions

**[The US has donated at least \$1.5bn through the Merida Initiative
since 2008]{.underline}** (another \$1bn has been agreed by Congress --
[PDF](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41349.pdf)), while Mexico has
spent at least \$54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say
that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry
open to corruption at every level. But the biggest costs have been
human: since 2007, almost 200,000 people have been murdered and more
than 28,000 reported as disappeared. In September 2014, [43 trainee
teachers disappeared and are presumed to have been
killed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/30/scores-students-missing-after-ambush-gunmen-mexican-police)
after they were attacked by corrupt police officers and handed over to
drug gang members. The case -- in which the Mexican army as well as
corrupt politicians were implicated -- has become emblematic of the
violence perpetrated in heavily militarized zones. Human rights groups
have detailed [a vast rise in human rights abuses by security
forces](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/09/mexico-torture-human-rights-violations-united-nations-report)
who are under pressure to make arrests, obtain confessions and justify
the war. Reports of torture by security forces increased by 600% between
2003 and 2013, [according to Amnesty
International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/AMR41/020/2014/en/).
As the cartels have fractured and diversified, other violent crimes such
as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In 2010, the Los Zetas
cartel -- founded by a group of Special Forces deserters -- [massacred
72 migrants who were kidnapped while trying to reach the
US](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/25/mexico-massacre-central-american-migrants).
Hundreds of thousands of people have been [displaced by
violence](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/03/mexico-drug-wars-thousands-displaced-from-homes),
and [self-defence or vigilante groups have emerged in several
states](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/28/mexican-militias-vigilantes-drug-cartels)
including Guerrero, Oaxaca and Michoacán, as communities have taken up
arms in an attempt to protect themselves. Some of those militias have in
turn been targeted by state forces or co-opted by organized crime.
**[Improved collaboration between US and Mexican intelligence and
security services has resulted in [numerous high-profile arrests and
drug
busts](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/mexico-drug-kingpins-behind-bars-violence-corruption-unchecked).]{.underline}**
Officials say **[25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón's most wanted
list have been jailed, extradited to the US]{.underline}** or killed**[,
although not all of these actions have been independently
corroborated]{.underline}**. More than 110,000 tonnes of cocaine was
decommissioned and almost 180,000 hectares (444,790 acres) of marijuana
and poppies destroyed during Calderón's term. Since Calderón's
successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, took power in December 2012, 101 of his
administration's 122 most wanted capos are dead or in custody; again,
not all the reported deaths and detentions have been independently
corroborated. **[The biggest victory]{.underline}** -- and most
embarrassing blunder -- under Peña Nieto's leadership **[was the
recapture, escape and another recapture of [Joaquín "El Chapo"
Guzmán](https://www.theguardian.com/world/joachim-el-chapo-guzm-n),
leader of the Sinaloa cartel.]{.underline}** Guzmán is fighting
extradition to the US, though this appears increasingly futile.
Meanwhile, his rivals are making audacious moves to annex his lucrative
routes, generating a new wave of violence in states such as Colima, Baja
California and Sinaloa. The crackdown and capture of kingpins has won
praise from the media and US, but it has done little to reduce the
violence or establish the rule of law.

#### Mexican War on Drugs not possible without the Merida Initiative.

Nina **Lakhani**, 12-8-20**16**, \"Mexico\'s war on drugs: what has it
achieved and how is the US involved?,\" Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/dec/08/mexico-war-on-drugs-cost-achievements-us-billions

**[Under pressure from the authorities, some crime factions have
splintered.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, new battlegrounds have sprung up
in previously peaceful states as military operations incited gangs to
find new smuggling routes in rival territories. Calderon's policies have
remained largely intact under Peña Ñieto -- even though the rhetoric
changed significantly in an attempt to rehabilitate Mexico's desperate
image and attract foreign investment. "Whereas the Calderón
administration was obsessed with security, President Peña Nieto has been
obsessed with not being obsessed with security," the [security expert
David Shirk has said](http://www.cfr.org/mexico/drug-war-mexico/p24262).
Under the current government, the security and defense budget has
continued to rise, and so has the bloodshed. About 63,000 people were
murdered in the first half of Pena Nieto's term -- 50% more than in
Calderon's first three years. And huge quantities of drugs continue to
make their way into the US. Drug consumption in the US -- the world's
biggest market -- continues to steadily rise with 24.6m recent users in
2013 -- [equating to 9.4% of the population over 12 years old, compared
with 8.3% in
2002](https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends).
Drug trends tend to wax and wane, in part reflecting the focus of law
enforcement efforts, so while cocaine use has gone down slightly down,
marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines are on the upswing. The
legalization of marijuana in a growing number of US states will reduce
demand from Mexico, but the rest of the market is booming. Mexican drug
cartels are estimated to make between [\$19bn and \$29bn
annually](http://www.ice.gov/doclib/cornerstone/pdf/cps-study.pdf) from
US drug sales. **[The "war on drugs" doctrine is largely credited to
President Richard Nixon, who created the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) in 1973 to declare "an all-out global war on the drug menace".
Since then, the US has spent more than \$2.5tn battling this
indeterminate enemy through prohibition and militarization. Over the
past four decades, the US model has been exported to Latin America --
most notably Colombia and
[Mexico](https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico). Mexico's decade-long
war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection
of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida
Initiative.]{.underline}**

#### Merida Initiative is working against the Drug Cartels.

Mariano **Castillo**, Cnn, 2-16-20**12**, \"Is Mexico\'s drug war
strategy working?,\" CNN,
https://www.cnn.com/2012/02/16/world/americas/mexico-drug-war-strategy/index.html

**[The United States has aided through the \$1.4 billion Merida
Initiative, which gave the Mexicans Black Hawk Helicopters, but also
training for police, prosecutors and defenders.]{.underline}** Measuring
success In the early stages of the offensive, Mexico\'s Secretary of
Defense, Guillermo Galvan, expressed the goal of the campaign as this:
\"To provide the level of security that can make viable citizen\'s
life.\" If it is true that this level of security exists in most of
Mexico, it is also true that most of Mexico has not suffered the drug
violence up close. As the government points out, the violence is limited
to certain regions, like the border states of Chihuahua, Tamaulipas and
Nuevo Leon, or in Sinaloa, the cradle of a cartel of the same name. Do
Mexicans enjoy a \"viable\" life there? Drug cartels have branched out
into kidnapping, extortion, human smuggling and suppression of the
media. And residents in those hotspots where the cartels operate
continue to live under these conditions. Galvan himself, in a speech
this month, admitted that the security of Mexico \"finds itself
seriously threatened.\" In some areas, security forces find themselves
overrun by the traffickers, he said. \"In some regions of the country,
organized crime has overtaken state institutions, and once empowered,
diversified their ominous activities to deprive society of its rights,
generating a climate of unprecedented violence,\" he said. In those same
areas, though, **[slowdowns in violence are evidence that sending in the
military does have an impact, said Andrew Selee, director of the Mexico
Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \"I
think the government overstates its case often, but there is progress,\"
he said. Indeed, some of the major cartels, such as the Beltran-Leyva
Organization and the Tijuana cartel, are shadows of their former selves.
Calderon\'s offensive has succeeded in disrupting the command and
control of the major cartels, he said. The cartels are less cohesive
than they once were, and the violence, while still present, is more
decentralized, he said. The threat from the cartels is gradually
shifting from a national security threat to a public security issue, he
said.]{.underline}**

## AT Merida bad for mexico

#### Merida Initiative helps Mexico overall. Ray Walser, 7-23-2018, \"Mexico, Drug Cartels, and the Merida Initiative: A Fight We Cannot Afford to Lose,\" Heritage Foundation, <https://www.heritage.org/americas/report/mexico-drug-cartels-and-the-merida-initiative-fight-we-cannotafford-lose>

During his March 2007 trip to Latin America, President Bush met with
President Calderón at Mer­ida in the Yucatan. The two leaders agreed to
develop a multi-year program to strengthen Mex­ico\'s capabilities to
fight organized crime. They fur­ther discussed and reviewed the program
at the August 2007 meeting with Canadian Prime Minis­ter Stephen Harper
in Montebello, Canada. **[On October 22, 2007, the U.S. and Mexico
issued a joint statement of principles launching the Merida Initiative.
Mexico pledged to strengthen its capabilities to fight drug cartels and
organized crime, and the U.S. promised to reduce demand for illegal
drugs and to combat trafficking in weapons and bulk cash. Both sides
committed to improving international cooperation, coordination, and
infor­mation exchange.]{.underline}** The Merida Initiative has several
distinctive fea­tures that are quite different from Plan Colombia. First,
no U.S. troops will be deployed in Mexico, and the overall law
enforcement footprint should remain very low. The delivery of goods and
the training to Mexicans will take place largely on U.S. soil. Both
parties appear very mindful of respecting each other\'s national
sovereignty. About 41 percent of Merida Initiative funding is slated for
the purchase of helicopters (Bell 412 heli­copters) and fixed-wing
surveillance aircraft (Casa 245 twin-engine aircraft) to support
interdiction activities and facilitate rapid response by Mexican law
enforcement agencies. The rest of **[the money will be used to purchase
non-intrusive inspection equipment, ion scanners, and canine units to
inter­dict trafficking of drugs, arms, cash, and people across the
border. Other components of the assistance package include providing
technical advice and training to strengthen the institutions of justice,
helping to vet new police force members, creating new offices to handle
citizen complaints and promote professional responsibility, and
establishing witness protection programs. The package will
also]{.underline}** support Mexican efforts to reduce the demand for
drugs, **[fight cor­ruption, protect human rights, and enhance Mex­ico\'s
ability to manage its border.]{.underline}** The price tag for the
three-year program is \$1.5 billion. This is a substantial increase over
\$369.6 million in U.S. assistance for counternarcotics activ­ities
between 2000 and 2006.

### Guns

#### Restrictions on Gun Sales at the border has been shown to lower the number of weapons going to cartels.

Christopher **Ingraham**, 1-14-20**16**, \"Why Mexico's drug cartels
love America's gun laws,\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/01/14/why-mexicos-drug-cartels-love-americas-gun-laws/?utm_term=.2a19450508f2

The flow of guns from the U.S. to Mexico shares some DNA with the black
market drug trade between the two countries. \"**[Firearms that criminal
organizations acquire from the United States are primarily transported
overland into Mexico using the same routes and methods employed when
smuggling bulk cash south and drugs north across the U.S.-Mexico
border,]{.underline}**\" the report notes. Typically, it appears that
criminal organizations in Mexico rely on straw purchases in the United
States to acquire guns legally and then funnel them southward.
\"**[Firearm trafficking organizations also frequently obtain firearms
from unlicensed private sellers in secondary markets, particularly at
gun shows and flea markets or through classified ads or private-party
Internet postings,\" the report found. A [2013 University of San Diego
report](https://igarape.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Paper_The_Way_of_the_Gun_web2.pdf)
found that nationally, the illegal firearms trade with Mexico accounted
for \$127 million in annual revenue for the U.S. firearms industry, or
2.2 percent of all gun sales.]{.underline}** For certain sellers along
the border, this percentage is likely to be much higher. The Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has data on exactly which of these
retailers are disproportionately likely to sell guns that end up in the
hands of cartels. But neither you nor I nor researchers nor state and
local governments are allowed to see that data thanks to Congress. In
2005, they [passed a bill prohibiting
ATF](http://smartgunlaws.org/federal-law-on-tiahrt-amendments/) from
sharing this data with the public, government agencies, and even with
researchers who could help figure out how to try to stanch the flow of
illegal guns. But we do know that in aggregate, **[among the guns that
could be traced back to a particular dealer, nearly three-quarters
originated from a seller in California, Arizona or Texas]{.underline}**,
according to the GAO report. The report notes that there are thousands
of licensed firearm dealers operating in those states. There are any
number of steps authorities could take to reduce the southward flow of
guns. President Obama\'s [recent executive actions on
guns](http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/documents/politics/white-house-gun-violence-reduction-executive-actions/248/),
which will require more sellers to obtain a federal firearms license,
may be helpful to the extent that they increase background checks for
gun purchases along the border. Open access to the data on who, exactly,
is selling these guns is another potential way to address the issue, but
that would require an act of Congress. And several years ago, **[The
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms implemented a rule requiring
dealers in the border states to report multiple sales of certain
high-caliber rifles to the ATF.]{.underline}** Gun rights groups like
the NRA called \"foul.\" The NRA backed a lawsuit to get the rule
overturned, but it [in 2013 a three-judge federal panel ruled
unanimously](http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2013/05/court-upholds-obama-border-state-gun-sale-reporting-165119)
that it could stay in place. ATF reports that the rule is working.
\"**[ATF officials reported that this information has helped them
identify firearms traffickers and others involved in a timelier manner,
which on several occasions has led to arrests and seizures of firearms
intended for trafficking to Mexico,\" according to the GAO report. The
number of American-made rifles seized by Mexican authorities has fallen
by more than half since the rule was implemented in 2011.]{.underline}**
The gun debate in this country is often framed between extremes \--
either you take people\'s guns away, or you don\'t do anything. But the
ATF reporting requirement is just one example of a minor regulatory
change between those extremes that can have a real-world impact on gun
violence.

#### The best way to lessen illegal immigration and lower cartel violence is to put restrictions on gun sales.

Lisa **Marie** Paneassociated Press, 9-30-20**18**, \"As immigrants flow
into U.S., American guns go south,\" Press Herald,
https://www.pressherald.com/2018/09/30/as-immigrants-flow-into-u-s-american-guns-go-south/

Among the thousands of immigrants who have been coming across the
U.S.-Mexico border in recent months, many are seeking to escape gang and
drug violence raging in their homelands. The weapon of choice used to
intimidate them? Often an American-made gun. **[While the flow of drugs
and immigrants into the U.S. has been well-documented for decades and
become a regular part of the political debate, what is often overlooked
is how gangs and drug cartels exploit weaknesses at the border to
smuggle guns from the U.S. into Latin America.]{.underline}** A 2013
report by the University of San Diego says the number of firearms
smuggled from the United States was so significant that nearly half of
American gun dealers rely on that business to stay afloat. On average,
**[an estimated 253,000 firearms each year are purchased in the United
States expressly to be sent to Mexico, the report said, the vast
majority of the sales originating in the border states of California,
Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. Once in Mexico, the weapons end up in the
hands of drug cartels]{.underline}** or get shipped to gangs in
Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- countries that are dealing with
an epidemic of gun violence. Armed holdups on public transportation are
a regular occurrence in Honduras, where nearly half of the unregistered
weapons originated in the U.S., the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives reported in recent years. Gun violence in El
Salvador is so rampant that the country has been averaging more than one
shootout a day between police and gangs this year, said Ricardo Sosa, a
criminologist specializing in gangs and security in El Salvador. "In
every one of these operations, police are able to seize between two and
six firearms at the scene," he said. "That is one of the indicators that
the gangs are armed on many occasions with long guns and short guns for
each one of their members." Mexico last year recorded its highest number
of murders in nearly two decades, with more than 31,000 people killed,
higher than even during the country's drug war in 2011. It continues
unabated with an average of 88 people killed each day in the first five
months of this year. The bloodshed in Guatemala, Honduras and El
Salvador has been a big driver of immigration into the U.S., with the
government saying nearly 16,000 families came across the border in
August alone -- many of them from those three countries. Gun-control
groups contend that the **[U.S. government is essentially exporting gang
violence to Latin America with permissive gun laws -- which in turn
creates an immigration crisis along the border. "If the Trump
administration were serious about wanting to stop refugees from fleeing
violence in Latin America and Mexico to come north, they would be doing
something about the southward gun trafficking that is fueling a lot of
that migration," said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel with the Giffords Law
Center]{.underline}**. Gun-rights activists say the issue is overblown
and mischaracterized. The National Rifle Association and other
gun-rights groups contend the most effective way to combat the problem
is not with stricter gun laws but by eradicating drug cartels and other
criminal enterprises. They say the numbers are inflated and that the
industry has proactively sought to educate licensed gun dealers on how
to detect "straw purchases," in which a firearm is bought expressly to
give it to someone who otherwise would not be able to legally own a gun.
"Obviously, Mexico has a huge problem with rampant corruption that
clearly cannot be blamed on the U.S.," the NRA said in a position paper
on the issue in 2009. "At the same time, Mexico has extremely
prohibitive gun laws, yet has far worse crime than the U.S." In 2011,
gun dealers along the border states were required to report to the ATF
anytime someone purchased two or more semiautomatic long guns in a
five-day period.

#### The Cartels are getting weapons via loopholes in US gun laws.

Bryan **Schatz**, 1-12-20**16**, \"How drug cartels sneak guns into
Mexico---through a loophole in US law,\" Mother Jones,
https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/01/united-states-guns-trafficking-mexico-cartels/

**[The same routes that Mexico's drug cartels use to smuggle drugs into
the United States are also used to run American guns into Mexico,
according to [a new
report](http://democrats-foreignaffairs.house.gov/sites/democrats.foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/01-16%20GAO%20Report%20on%20US%20Efforts%20to%20Combat%20Firearms%20Trafficking%20to%20Mexico.pdf)
from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).]{.underline}** The
report, commissioned by Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and published
yesterday, reveals that 70 percent---more than 73,000---of the guns
recovered from crime scenes in Mexico and traced by the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) from 2009 to 2014
originated in the United States. These weapons have fueled the ongoing
war among the drug cartels and between the cartels and Mexican security
forces, contributing to the more than 100,000 killings in the country
since 2007. The cartels' weapons of choice are high-caliber rifles\*, as
well as AR-15 and AK-47-type semiautomatic rifles, which can be easily
converted into fully automatic machine guns**[. The cartel's gunrunners
often buy firearms legally in the United States, either at gun shops,
gun shows, or in private sales. The firearms are then illegally shipped
across the border. Increasingly, the cartels are shipping weapons parts
into Mexico to be assembled into firearms. It's especially difficult to
detect. But increasingly, the cartels are shipping weapons parts into
Mexico to be assembled into finished firearms]{.underline}**. It's a
discreet process that is especially difficult to detect. Firearm
manufacturers or importers in the United States are not required to
stamp serial numbers on gun parts. Retailers do not have to report when
they buy and sell parts kits with everything needed to complete a gun
except a receiver. Receivers, which house the mechanical components of a
firearm, like trigger groups and magazine feeds, can be purchased
separately. To avoid detection, gunrunners will often use unfinished, or
"80-percent" receivers---receivers that are mostly complete but require
some further machining to be functional. As I [previously
reported](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/05/ak-47-semi-automatic-rifle-building-party)
when I attended a gun building party in California, unfinished receivers
are not classified as firearms. They don't require serial numbers and
generally have no markings, which makes firearms assembled with them
untraceable. **["They are also easy to conceal," the GAO report noes,
"making it more challenging for customs authorities to detect illicit
shipments of such parts."]{.underline}** As Rep. Engel noted in [a
statement](https://democrats-foreignaffairs.house.gov/news/press-releases/engel-welcomes-new-report-firearms-trafficking-mexico),
the ATF has discretion over how it defines a receiver. Yet, as Engel
puts it, "far too often, unfinished gun receivers are minimally modified
to avoid regulation." The ATF has long been hindered by a [lack of funds
and
agents](http://www.sfgate.com/nation/article/ATF-poorly-armed-with-funding-as-duties-grow-4950373.php),
a problem that President Obama addressed in the executive action he
[announced last
week](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2016/01/obama-guns-executive-action-background-checks)
that includes adding 200 new ATF agents and investigators. Engel said
Congress could do more to "stop the illegal flow of guns across the
U.S.-Mexico border" but accused his Republican colleagues of being "much
more concerned with loosening already lax gun regulations than
protecting citizens in both of our countries from gun violence." The GAO
report also notes that collaboration between American and Mexican
authorities is fraught. In 2012, joint US-Mexico efforts to stem
firearms trafficking were scaled down when Mexican President Enrique
Peña Nieto sharply limited law enforcement collaboration. In the past
year, US officials reported to the GAO that collaboration is gaining
momentum, but concerns over corruption among Mexican officials is still
a problem. The report notes that Immigration and Customs Enforcement
officials in the United States "are concerned about sharing information
with ICE officials based in Mexico, fearing that the information may
unintentionally reach corrupt Mexican authorities and compromise their
investigations."

#### The problem is the lax restrictions on gun sales.

Julian **Aguilar, 16**, \"While people and drugs come north, guns pour
south into Mexico,\"
<https://www.texastribune.org/2016/12/07/gun-running-bsp-part-4/>

**[Illicit arms trafficking from Texas has for years contributed to the
carnage in Mexico, where tens of thousands have died since a full-scale
war between law enforcement and rival cartels began in
2005.]{.underline}** But convincing lawmakers to scale back gun rights
in Texas because of the connection to violence in Mexico has been, so
far, a non-starter in a state that has adopted "Come and Take It" as an
unofficial motto. "What you'll see is that they'll go to a gun store and
ask for five of one rifle and a bunch of magazines."--- Justin
Williamson, Texas State Rifle Association If anything, state legislators
are headed in the other direction. In 2015, they expanded gun rights by
passing laws allowing 21-year-old college students with licenses to
carry concealed weapons on some college campuses and licensed carriers
to tote their guns in plain sight, a practice commonly referred to as
open carry. Proponents of the Second Amendment have fought back against
claims that gun shows, which are held in major Texas cities at least
once a month and advertised on billboards along every major highway, are
the major source of guns that end up used in crimes south of the Rio
Grande. The GAO\'s 2016 report states that most of the guns headed south
were purchased legally at gun shows and subsequently smuggled into
Mexico. By law, firearms dealers must be registered and licensed by the
federal government. As of 2015, Texas had more of those sellers,
[10,856](https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/december-2015-list-ffl-type-state/download),
than any other state. (There were an additional 131 applications pending
--- another nationwide record -- as of the same date.) But some decry
what gun control supporters call the "gun show loophole,\" which they
argue allows dealers to sell without a license or without conducting
background checks on the buyer. The Texas State Rifle Association, the
state affiliate of the National Rifle Association, said the so-called
loophole is a myth. "**[The people who buy tables at gun shows, ATF
requirements requires that if \[they are\] going to purchase firearms
for the use of selling or for making a profit or for running a business,
you have to register for a \[federal firearms license\], which requires
that you run background checks,]{.underline}**" said Texas State Rifle
Association spokesman Justin Williamson. **[The problem, according to
the GAO report authors, is how easy it is for unlicensed sellers to
obtain and resell weapons. "Firearm trafficking organizations also
frequently obtain firearms from unlicensed private sellers in secondary
markets, particularly at gun shows and flea markets or through
classified ads or private-party internet postings, according to ATF
officials]{.underline}**," the report states. State Rep. [Rafael
Anchia](https://www.texastribune.org/directory/rafael-anchia/),
D-Dallas, said expanding background checks isn't as unpopular as some
gun rights proponents assume. He cited an October 2015 article by
fact-checking site
[Politifact](https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2015/oct/05/jeremy-bird/jeremy-bird-says-90-percent-americans-want-mandato/)
finding that about 90 percent of Americans, including about 75 percent
of NRA members, supported background checks for all purchases. "Polls
continue to show a strong tilt in favor of background checks prior to
all gun purchases," the authors wrote. "Then again, the popularity of
this idea may bear watching.

#### US Law systems are letting straw buyers obtain weapons easily.

2015 polls found as few as 84 percent of respondents backing the
universal checks." Anchia pre-filed legislation in November that would
expand background checks in Texas and include those private purchases he
said can be done anywhere, including the parking lot of a store. His
[House bill
259](http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/Search/DocViewer.aspx?ID=85RHB002591B&QueryText=%22gun%22&DocType=B)
would expand the definition of a "gun show" to include a place other
than a permanent retail store, including a \"driveway, sidewalk or
walkway, parking lot, or other parking area." The bill would make it a
class A misdemeanor if a seller didn't run a background check or
maintain a record of the transaction. "**[It's a vicious cycle. We send
our guns down south, and they send their drugs up north," he said. "You
can buy a weapon that can stop a heavy, armored vehicle without a
background check in Texas. That should be troublesome for
everybody."]{.underline}** But Anchia is in the minority party, and
Republicans are returning to Austin next year looking to pick up where
they left off in 2015, when they passed open and campus carry bills.
State Rep. [Jonathan
Stickland](https://www.texastribune.org/directory/jonathan-stickland/),
R-Bedford, pre-filed
[legislation](http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/Search/DocViewer.aspx?ID=85RHB003751B&QueryText=%22gun%22&DocType=B)
that would allow non-licensed gun holders to carry their firearms in
public, a measure commonly referred to as "constitutional carry." Anchia
said he remains determined to at least have a discussion on the issue.
"You're never going to get a hit unless you step up to bat," he said.
Williamson accepted that a problem exists with straw purchasers --- a
buyer that purchases weapons under the guise of personal use but instead
sells them to others who are prohibited from buying themselves. Felons,
people under indictment, undocumented immigrants, some legal immigrants
and people subject to a restraining order aren\'t legally able to buy a
gun. **[In one high-profile Texas case, a Houston man was stopped in
South Texas by police officers in 2013 and found with 35 military-style
weapons bound for Mexico. The driver, Angel Aquino Pineda, was just one
of several members of a gunrunning ring that authorities convicted after
making hundreds of trips during their years-long operation, the Houston
Chronicle
[reported](http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Seven-Houstonians-convicted-in-running-guns-to-5418890.php).]{.underline}**
Williamson said that **[most licensed dealers do their due diligence and
report people they think might be straw buyers. "What you'll see is that
they'll go to a gun store and ask for five of one rifle and a bunch of
magazines," he said. But if it's not a major bust for law enforcement,
he said, prosecutors won't spend the resources building a case if it
only yields a minor punishment or doesn\'t lead to a larger cache of
weapons.]{.underline}** As proof, Williamson cited the most famous
example, the botched Fast and Furious campaign, where agents let
small-time gun smugglers into Mexico in the hopes of nabbing larger
operatives.

MEXICO CITY -- [**Russian Foreign Minister** Sergei Lavrov **said that
Mexico is interested in buying** equipment and **weapons from his
country to combat drug trafficking** and organized crime.]{.underline}
At a joint press conference with Mexican counterpart Patricia Espinosa,
[Lavrov said that his country is expanding its weapons sales abroad and
has increased the number of supply contracts it has in all regions of
the world,]{.underline} a move that is "a purely economic question, not
political." Regarding the volume of its arms sales, Russia is still
"behind the United States, but we're seeing certain rather serious
progress," Lavrov said. The Mexican government is interested in
acquiring different types of weapons, "including helicopters for coastal
monitoring," and other equipment "to fight drug trafficking and
organized crime, that I hope will help our Mexican friends to combat
this scourge," the Russian official said.

**[Russia is working to expand its presence in Latin
America,]{.underline}** largely at Washington's expense, and 2018
presents it with many opportunities to do so[. Five Latin American
countries---Cuba, Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil---are going
through political transitions this year with multiple openings for
Russia to meddle.]{.underline} Souring attitudes toward the United
States throughout the region over trade and immigration issues, the rise
of populist candidates, and the deepening internal economic and [[social
challenges facing many Latin
American]{.underline}](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/inequality-is-getting-worse-in-latin-america-here-s-how-to-fix-it/)
countries create favorable circumstances for [[Russia to advance its
interests]{.underline}](https://lawfareblog.com/why-latin-america-needs-prepare-now-election-meddling)
Capitalizing on opportunities to gain a foothold in Latin America is a
familiar strategy for Russia. As [[White House Chief of Staff John
Kelly]{.underline}](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Kelly_03-12-15.pdf)
testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2015 in
his capacity as head of the U.S. Southern Command, the arm of the U.S.
military responsible for operations in Central and South
America:Periodically since 2008, Russia has pursued an increased
presence in Latin America through propaganda, military arms and
equipment sales, counterdrug agreements, and trade. Under President
\[Vladimir\] Putin, however, we have seen a clear return to Cold
War-tactics. As part of its global strategy, Russia is using power
projection in an attempt to erode U.S. leadership and challenge U.S.
influence in the Western Hemisphere.

Putin will want to be well positioned to spotlight his Latin American
ties for the upcoming G20 summit, scheduled for November 30--December 1
in Buenos Aires, Argentina---the first of these to be hosted in South
America. For Moscow, this event will be one way to push back against the
outcry and diplomatic isolation from Western governments after the March
2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the United
Kingdom and the April 2018 chemical weapons attack in Syria. Putin is
likely to tout his relationships with Latin American leaders---such as
the strategic partnership agreement he signed earlier this year with
Argentinian President Mauricio Macri---to avoid a repeat of the chilly
reception that he received at the 2014 G20 summit in Australia after
Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. For much of the post--Cold War
era, the United States and Europe paid little attention to Russia's
efforts to expand its political, economic, and military influence
abroad. The Soviet Union's dissolution, Russia's internal challenges,
and Moscow's stated desire for integration with the West sharply
constrained the Kremlin's interest and capacity to project its influence
on a global scale and diminished the West's interest in Russia's foreign
policy and global activities. The West saw these efforts as primarily
confined to Russia's immediate neighborhood and largely ineffective
elsewhere However, since Vladimir Putin's return to the presidency in
2012, Russia has engaged in a broad and surprisingly effective campaign
to expand its global reach. His reelection in March 2018 is likely to
see this campaign continue. To advance Russian objectives, Moscow has
relied on a wide array of diplomatic, military, intelligence, cyber,
trade, energy, and financial tools to influence political systems,
public attitudes, and elite decisionmakers in Europe, the Middle East,
Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These objectives---as outlined in the
2017 Carnegie paper "[The Return of Global Russia: An Analytical
Framework](https://carnegieendowment.org/2017/12/14/return-of-global-russia-analytical-framework-pub-75003)"---include,
primarily, undermining the U.S.-led liberal international order and the
West's cohesion; enhancing Putin's domestic legitimacy by demonstrating
Russia's status as a global power; and promoting specific Russian
commercial, military, and energy interests.^1^ Russian activity in Latin
America has not received nearly the same attention as Russian meddling
in the former Soviet space, Europe, or the United States, where its
impact is far more visible and wide-ranging. Yet Moscow may view its
gains in Central and South America as payback for what it has viewed as
U.S. interference [[in Russia's
backyard]{.underline}](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/kennan-cable-no20-understanding-russian-priorities-latin-america).
How effectively can Moscow expand its fairly limited standing in the
region beyond long-standing ties with Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela?
Can it significantly complicate U.S. relationships with partners such as
Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, and Argentina? Will it be able to degrade the
United States' image and reputation in the region? For the United
States, Russia's increasing presence in the Western Hemisphere is an
unwelcome factor that can further roil relations with its southern
neighbors and could present new military and security threats[**. Russia
is active in Latin America primarily through arms sales,** commercial
agreements, and high-level political outreach]{.underline}. While these
activities are driven largely by financial incentives, Putin's
motivation to boost Russia's profile is also firmly rooted in
geopolitics. Moscow has looked to develop partnerships with countries
that share an interest in creating institutions and relationships that
are not dominated by the United States or Europe. It has cultivated a
relationship with Brazil through the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India,
China, and South Africa) group, for example. Moscow has also sought to
deepen ties with allies that share the [Kremlin's increasingly
authoritarian](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018)
approach to governance and resentment of U.S. global leadership, such as
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro,
and Bolivian President Evo Morales. More recently, [Moscow's efforts
have sought to take advantage of U.S. policy shifts that have created
tensions in some countries' relations with the United States. U.S.
President Donald Trump's administration has sharply criticized Mexico's
stance on NAFTA and has called for a crackdown on immigration from Latin
America]{.underline}. The administration threatened the [Maduro
government with military
force](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/world/americas/trump-venezuela-maduro-latin-america.html)
in 2017 and has imposed increasingly severe financial sanctions to
encourage a political deal between the Venezuelan regime and its
opponents. Moscow appears poised to capitalize on these tensions in 2018
and to manipulate the environment to its advantage.  As Russia looks to
take advantage of opportunities in Latin America, it will remain focused
on three key areas of interest: alliances, trade, and security.
**[Russia is looking to develop a presence in all corners of the
globe]{.underline}** to solidify its image as a world power. It also
seeks to build relationships and create institutions that further its
aim of creating a multipolar world. Moscow has almost certainly taken
note of the many Central and South American nations that have sought to
assert their foreign policy independence and have not consistently
aligned themselves with the United States. For example, the Rio Group
denounced the 1999 [NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia](https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/190/38805.html).^2^
In 2003, Chile and Mexico indicated they would vote against the draft
[UN resolution for military action in
Iraq](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/08/iraq.unitednations).
In 2014, Bolivia, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela voted against the
resolution condemning Russia's action in Crimea. This year, less than
half of member heads of state attended the [Summit of the
Americas](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/20/make-the-summit-of-the-americas-great-again/)
in Lima, Peru. Such a decline in enthusiasm for an event that has long
been an opportunity for the United States to showcase its leadership
among American nations probably provides further incentive for Moscow to
continue building bridges with the region. Starting from a very low
base, Russia stands to gain economically by expanding its trade and
investment relationships in the region, particularly in the face of U.S.
and European sanctions. Although total trade between Russia and the
Latin American and Caribbean region was only \$12 billion in 2016, it
has increased by 44 percent since 2006, with [Brazil and Mexico
representing about 50 percent of all Russian trade with the
region]{.underline}. During this period, [[Russian firms have made
significant investments](https://wits.worldbank.org/about_wits.html) in
the oil and gas sector in countries such as Bolivia, Mexico, and
Venezuela.]{.underline} The broader economic relationship with Latin
America remains subdued due to [Russia's overall economic
decline](https://comtrade.un.org/data/). **[Moscow probably calculates
that close relations---whether built around arms sales, trade or energy
deals, or similar political views---will translate into physical access
for Russian military and security activities]{.underline}**. Access to
ports and airfields enables Moscow to deploy military assets to the
region, projecting its power and messaging the United States. After the
Georgian war in August 2008, for example, Russia sent ships on port
visits to the Caribbean and Venezuela and flew bombers on long-range
patrols. Although Moscow claimed these exercises had been long planned,
they were well timed to message its [displeasure with Washington's
support](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-venezuela-navy/russia-says-to-send-nuclear-warship-to-caribbean-idUSL871354420080908)
for the Georgian government, which had included sending U.S. ships to
the Black Sea. Amid worsening tensions with the United States, Russia
has opened facilities in Nicaragua ostensibly for
counternarcotics-related activities, and Russian officials have spoken
periodically about potentially reopening an intelligence collection
facility in Lourdes, Cuba, that was shuttered in 2001. Such efforts, at
a minimum, serve as a reminder that Moscow could expand its military and
security footprint in the Western Hemisphere to counter or pressure the
United States militarily.

#### Arm sales are key to Russia's political strategy in the Middle East.

an Update". Evan Ellis is a guest scholar at the Council on Hemispheric
Affairs.
http://www.coha.org/russian-engagement-in-latin-america-an-update/

In contrast to Chinese activities in Latin America**[, Russian
engagement is focused on a limited set of countries and their economic
sectors, led by arms sales]{.underline}**.  While Russia sends tourists
to the Caribbean and purchases agricultural goods from the Southern
Cone, businessmen and political leaders in the region simply do not
dream of access to vast Russian markets, loans and investments, as they
do with their Chinese counterparts. Russia currently has a limited
number of commercial projects in the region in petroleum, mining,
nuclear energy, construction, and space services.  It also sells a
modest number of vehicles and other goods to Cuba and select other
economies, but [beyond military goods, the competitiveness of Russian
products and services is minimal.]{.underline} In the past year, Russia
has lost ground with a number of partners in the region with whom it was
building relationships.  In Argentina, the election of pro-Western
President Mauricio Macri sealed the fate of several already troubled
projects including his nation's purchase of Su-24 interceptor aircraft,
the installation of GLONASS satellite communication facilities, and a
contract to build a nuclear reactor in the Atucha nuclear complex. In
Brazil, important Russian arms deals have remained stalled, including
the Pantsir S-1 air defense system, although the government did purchase
a large number of Igla-S (SA-24) air defense munitions, delivering the
last units in April 2017. Even in Venezuela, its main arms client in the
region, Russia appears to have lost ground.  There, the financial
collapse of the country's socialist regime appears to have forced it to
make a choice to invest in engine overhauls and other work to maintain
the operational capability of the existing fleet of Russian combat
aircraft and helicopters, putting on hold the acquisition of an
additional 13 Su-30 interceptors.While Russian setbacks in the region
may encourage U.S. complacency, they actually mask dynamics in the
region through which Russia would be able to expand its presence more
rapidly than is commonly recognized. [In Mexico, whose Army has numerous
senior officers who have been indoctrinated (and presumably evaluated)
in Russian military institutions**, the political tension with the U.S.
has created an incentive for Mexico to move closer to Russia as a
geopolitical counterweight and warning to the U.S.**]{.underline}  The
Russian dual-use manufacturer Kamov has already sold Mexico ANSAT
helicopters, and Mexico is reportedly set to reevaluate the purchase of
more Mi-17s.  A victory by leading leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador (AMLO) in the July 2018 presidential elections could push Mexico
even further toward collaboration with Moscow.

for U.S. helicopters, Moscow swooped in for the sale**.]{.underline}
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Mannuel Lopez Obrador, said the eight
Sikorsky MH-60R Seahawk helicopters, intended for the Mexican Navy, were
too expensive.But Sputnik News, the Russian news site always lavish in
praise of Russian weapons, helpfully offered some advice. "Are there
more affordable alternatives with similar capabilities out there?"
Sputnik asked, noting that the Mexican Navy already operates Mi-17
transport helicopters. Can you guess what's coming? "Sikorsky and its
parent company Lockheed Martin isn't the only game in town as far as
naval helicopters go," Sputnik wrote last week. "Russia's naval
workhorse, the Ka-27, has comparable capabilities, and would likely to
be much cheaper, if it were made available." "The Ka-27M, the latest
modification of the tried and proven Ka-27 design, is equipped with an
advanced integrated radar, acoustic and menetometric sensors and SIGINT
suite, and a 360 degree monitoring system enabling the semi-automatic
search and detection of surface, air and ground-based targets," the news
site said. "[Armament can include light homing torpedoes, 50 and 250
kilogram \[110 to 551 pound\] anti-submarine bombs, heavy machine guns,
and four external hardpoints for an assortment of other weapons. **The
customizable package would almost certainly be enough for fighting drug
traffickers."**]{.underline} Sputnik described the Seahawk's price,
which it claimed to be \$170 million apiece, as "hefty." But Sputnik was
vaguer about the cost of a Ka-27. "Details on the price of the gunship
Ka-27s are hard to come by, although a single Ka-27PV, the armed version
of the Ka-27PS, has an estimated price tag of \$14.5 million. The
Russian defense ministry\'s 2014 and 2016 outlays to modernize existing
anti-submarine warfare configuration Ka-27PLs came in at just over \$10
million apiece."Sputnik also praised the Ka-27 as being cheap to
operate, sturdy and reliable, and customizable for a variety of
missions. The helicopters are used by Russia's Border Guard Service, as
well as the Algerian, Chinese, Indian, Syrian, Ukrainian, Vietnamese and
Yemeni navies. But Mexico, the southern neighbor of the United States?
Not a chance, says Inigo Guevara, a former director of Mexico's National
Security Council and now director at Jane's Defense and Security in
Washington, DC. First, Lopez Obrador and his transition team are new to
the helicopter issue and lack the defense expertise to assess it.

[**The engagement between** the People's Republic of **China and the
Latin America** and Caribbean (LAC) **region** during the twenty-first
**century is highlighted by its extraordinary increase in** commercial,
political, and **military relations**.]{.underline} Since China's
entrance into the World Trade Organization in 2001, it has become an
increasingly vibrant partner for the region. Chinese banks leased
approximately "\$22.1 billion to Latin American governments, more than
the combined loans from the two traditional multilateral lenders, the
World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank."^1^ Most researchers
and senior U.S. policy makers have focused on Chinese economic activity,
highlighting "its sale of increasingly diverse and sophisticated
products in the Latin American and Caribbean market."^2^ Similar to
China's sharp increase in economic relations, it has also significantly
expanded its military engagement, effectively creating opportunities to
expand its arms market in the LAC region. However, [little assessment
has been placed on China's emergence into the region's arms market,
particularly how that emergence pertains to China's comprehensive
strategy in building influence and strengthening military
partnerships.^3^]{.underline}The sale of Chinese arms has several
implications for the LAC region. For one, **[arms exports are a symbol
of a country's position in the global hierarchical system of arms
production]{.underline}**.^4^ Efficient arms production can provide
revenue and balance costs related to defense research and
development.^5^ On a functional level, armies must procure arms that
have a maintainable life cycle. One can also argue that **[arms exports
are a key component in a nation's foreign policy and can help secure
influence, or "soft power]{.underline}**." Simply put, the expansion of
arms exports may provide multiple benefits and can reflect a nation's
interests abroad[. In Latin America, the increase in arms sales has
complemented China's goals of "securing access to natural resources and
exports markets."]{.underline}^6^ It is important to note that China's
"complementing" differs from "facilitating." "If the latter becomes more
prominent, it may be a worthy indicator or warning of a significant
shift in the security environment."^7^ Given bureaucratic hurdles in
expanding a nation's defense industry to compete in the global arms
market, analyzing China's arms flows to Latin America can provide
further specific insight into the maturity of Sino-LAC military
relations.

#### China is already selling arms to Latin America -- it's key to there military engagement.

One of the most common statements made in discussions of Chinese
engagement with Latin America is that such ties are primarily
"commercial" in nature. While true, the focus on the commercial
dimension of the relationship conceals the fact that, over the past
several years[, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has also expanded
its military ties with Latin America]{.underline} in multiple important
ways, consistent with its own public declarations of intention. In
November 2008, for example, the PRC issued its first official policy
paper on Latin America in which it announced that it sought to enhance
"mutual visits by defense and military officials of the two sides as
well as personnel exchanges," and to deepen "professional exchanges in
military training, personnel training and peacekeeping."1 [China's
military engagement with Latin America in recent years has both expanded
and deepened in a quite public manner]{.underline}. High-level trips by
Latin American defense and security personnel to the PRC and visits by
their Chinese counterparts have become commonplace. **[The volume and
sophistication of Chinese arms sold to the region have
increased.]{.underline}** Officer exchange programs, institutional
visits, and other lower-level ties have also expanded. Chinese military
personnel have begun participating in operations in the region in
modest, yet symbolically important ways.

#### China is ramping up arm sales now -- rapidly diversifying the number of countries it sells to.

is selling arms to more countries]{.underline}** and is now the world's
leading exporter of armed drones, according to a report released by the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday. But
the latest data from the Swedish think tank shows Chinese arms exports
increased by a relatively low 2.7 per cent in the period from 2014 to
2018, compared to the previous five years.Weapons exports from the
United States, however, jumped 29 per cent in the 2014-18 period from
2009-13. Meanwhile, [**China expanded its customer base to 53
countries** in 2014-18, **up from 41** in the previous five
years.]{.underline} The researchers also found that China is the world
leader in sales of armed drones, or unmanned combat aerial vehicles --
supplying 153 of them to 13 countries in the past five years. By
contrast, the US -- the world's biggest arms exporter -- only sold five
armed drones, to Britain, over the 10 years from 2009. The main buyers
of the Chinese drones are Middle Eastern countries, including Egypt,
Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Nan Tian, a
researcher with SIPRI's arms transfers and military expenditure
programme, said [China's military technology advances -- with more
emphasis on developing its own weapons]{.underline} -- were a key reason
for the slower growth in arms exports, along with its defence budget.

Camron Scott Galloway, 21, walked into X Caliber Guns in Phoenix, Ariz.,
on Jan. 30, 2008, and filled out forms for the purchase of six [**AK-47
rifles**.]{.underline} Reliable and powerful, and a bargain at about
\$500 each, [**the Romanian-made gun**, a semiautomatic version of the
iconic Kalashnikov assault weapon, **had become popular with the drug
cartels in Mexico.**]{.underline} Galloway, who eventually pleaded
guilty to gun charges and became a cooperating prosecution witness in a
broader case, testified [that he agreed to act as the purchaser of the
Romanian AKs on behalf of a co-worker's brother, who was trafficking
weapons south of the border.]{.underline} Just for doing the paperwork,
he earned \$100 per rifle. Four months later, one of the same guns that
Galloway signed for surfaced in a safe house used by the [Beltran
Leyva](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/beltran-leyva-organization)
drug cartel in northwest
[Mexico](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/mexico-country-profile).
The discovery followed a deadly shootout between federal agents and drug
dealers in Culiacán, the capital of the Pacific state of Sinaloa. Eight
police officers were killed. In the grim accounting of death and
violence from Mexico's drug wars, the episode might be written off as a
footnote. After all, almost 35,000 people have been killed in violence
in the four years since President Felipe Calderón began deploying troops
and federal police throughout Mexico to ratchet up the fight against the
cartels.

Until 1989 Romania\'s Defense Industry had been an important economic
sector, covering 85% of the procurement needs of the Romanian Defense
Forces and contributing with allmost 1 billion US\$ every year to
exports**[, thus situating Romania among the top arms exporters in the
world.]{.underline}** Certaintly**[, compared to the local
needs]{.underline}**, [**the production capacities** of the dozens of
Uzina Mecanica \[Machine Plants, literally Plant Mechanics\] **were
oversized, in accordance with the external market
opportunities**.]{.underline} Equipped with eastern technologies,
relatively modern for those times, the Romanian defense factories have
had their foreign buyers among the Warsaw Pact and COMECON countries,
but also among the African and Arab countries having special politic and
economic ties with Romania. Within Defense Industry sector there were
more than 200,000 well trained and disciplined employees, while the
management was a centralized one.
