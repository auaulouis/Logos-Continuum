IF IT AIN\'T BROKE . . . In the nineteenth century, when the United
States was weak, leaders from George Washington to William McKinley
mostly avoided foreign entanglements and concentrated on building power
domestically, expanding the country\'s reach across North America and
eventually expelling the European great powers from the Western
Hemisphere. In the first half of the twentieth century, U[.S. presidents
such as Wood- row Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt used the country\'s
newfound strength to restore the balance of power in strategically
critical regions]{.underline} outside the Western Hemisphere. But they
let other great powers do most of the heavy lifting, and thus [the
United States emerged relatively unscathed-and stronger than ever-from
the world wars that devastated Asia and Europe.]{.underline} Letting
other states shoulder the burden was not possible during the Cold War,
so the United States stepped up and led the alliances that contained the
Soviet Union. [American leaders paid lip service to democracy promotion,
human rights, and other idealistic concerns, but U.S. policy was realist
at its core]{.underline}. Through the Bretton Woods system and its
successors, the United States also helped foster a more open world
economy, balancing economic growth against the need for financial
stability, national autonomy, and domestic legitimacy. **[Put simply,
for most of U.S. history, American leaders were acutely sensitive to the
balance of power, passed the buck when they could, and took on difficult
missions when necessary.]{.underline}** But [when the Soviet Union
collapsed and the United States found itself]{.underline}, as the former
national security adviser Brent Scowcroftput it in 1998, \"[standing
alone]{.underline} at the height of power . . . with the rarest
opportunity to shape the world,\" [U.S. leaders rejected the realism
that had worked well for decades and tried to remake global politics in
accordance with American values.]{.underline} A new strategy-liberal
hegemony-sought to spread democracy and open markets across the globe.
[That goal is the common thread linking President Bill Clinton\'s policy
of \"engagement and enlargement,\"]{.underline} President George W.
[Bush\'s \"freedom agenda,\" and]{.underline} President Barack [Obama\'s
embrace of the Arab revolts]{.underline} of 2010-11 and his declaration
that \"there is no right more fundamental than the ability to choose
your leaders and determine your destiny.\" Such thinking won broad
support from both political parties, the federal bureaucracies that deal
with international affairs, and most of the think tanks, lobbies, and
media figures that constitute the foreign policy establishment. At
bottom, **[liberal hegemony is a highly revisionist
strategy.]{.underline}** Instead of working to maintain favorable
balances of power in a few areas of vital interest, [the United States
sought to transform regimes all over the world and recruit new members
into the economic and security institutions it dominated.]{.underline}
**[The results were dismal: failed wars, financial crises, staggering
inequality, frayed alliances, and emboldened adversaries.]{.underline}**
HEGEMONIC HUBRIS [When Clinton took office in 1993]{.underline}, the
[United States was on favorable terms with the world\'s other major
powers, including China and Russia. Democracy was spreading, Iraq was
being disarmed, and Iran had no nuclear enrichment
capacity.]{.underline} The Oslo Accords seemed to herald an end to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Washington seemed well positioned to
guide that process. The European Union was adding new members and moving
toward a common currency, and the U.S. economy was performing well.
Americans saw terrorism as a minor problem, and the U.S. military seemed
unstoppable. The wind was at the country\'s back. Life was good. **[But
those circumstances fueled a dangerous overconfidence among American
elites.]{.underline}** [Convinced that the United States was \"the
indispensable nation,\"]{.underline} as Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright famously put it in 1998, [they believed they had the right, the
responsibility, and the wisdom to shape political arrangements in every
corner of the world. **That vision turned out to be a hubristic
fantasy**]{.underline}. Repeated attempts to broker peace between the
Israelis and the Palestinians all failed, and [the two-state solution
sought by three U.S. presidents is no longer a viable option. Al Qaeda
attacked the U.S. homeland on September 11, 2001, and Washington
responded by launching a global war on terrorism]{.underline}, including
invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. **[Those campaigns were costly
failures and shattered the U.S. military\'s aura of invincibility. Much
of the Middle East is now embroiled in conflict, and violent extremists
operate from Africa to Central Asia and beyond]{.underline}**.
[Meanwhile, India, Pakistan, and North Korea tested and deployed nuclear
weapons, and Iran become a latent nuclear weapons state.]{.underline}
[The collapse of the U.S. housing market in 2008 exposed widespread
corruption]{.underline} in the country\'s financial institutions **[and
triggered the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression-a
calamity from which the global economy has yet to fully
recover.]{.underline}** In 2014, [Russia seized Crimea, and it has
interfered in a number of other countries since then-and its relations
with the West are now worse]{.underline} than at any time since the Cold
War. [China\'s power and ambitions have expanded, and cooperation
between Beijing and Moscow has deepened. **The eurozone crisis, the
United Kingdom\'s decision to withdraw from the eu, and energetic
populist movements have raised doubts about the eu\'s
future**]{.underline}. **[Democracy is in retreat
worldwide;]{.underline}** according to Freedom House, [2018 was the 13th
consecutive year in which global freedom declined]{.underline}.
[Illiberal leaders govern in Hungary and Poland,]{.underline} and the
Economist Intelligence Unit\'s annual [Demoracy Index has downgraded the
United States from a \"full\" to a \"flawed\" democracy. The United
States]{.underline} was not solely responsible for all these adverse
developments, but it **[played a major role in most of
them.]{.underline}** And **[the taproot of many of these failures was
Washington\'s embrace of liberal hegemony]{.underline}**. For starters,
[that strategy expanded U.S. security obligations without providing new
resources]{.underline} with which to meet them. [The policy of \"dual
containment,\" aimed at Iran and Iraq, forced the United States to keep
thousands of troops on the Arabian Peninsula, an additional burden
tha]{.underline}t also helped [convince Osama bin Laden to strike at the
U.S. homeland. **Nato expansion committed Washington to defend weak and
vulnerable new members, even as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom
let their military forces atrophy.**]{.underline} Equally important,
[U.S. efforts to promote democracy, the open-ended expansion of nato,
and the extension of the alliance\'s mission far beyond its original
parameters poisoned relations with Russia]{.underline}. **[And fear of
U.S.-led regime change encouraged several states to pursue a nuclear
deterrent-in the case of North Korea, successfully]{.underline}**. [When
the United States did manage to topple a foreign foe]{.underline}, as it
did in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, [the results were]{.underline} not
thriving new democracies but **[costly occupations, failed states, and
hundreds of thousands of dead civilians]{.underline}**. It was
delusional for U.S. leaders to expect otherwise: creating a functional
democracy is a difficult process under the best of circumstances, but
[trying to do it in fractured societies one barely understands is a
fool\'s errand.]{.underline} Finally, [**globalization did not deliver
as promised.** Opening up markets to trade and investment brought great
benefits to lower and middle classes in China, India, and other parts of
the developing world]{.underline}. **[It also further magnified the
already staggering wealth of the world\'s richest one
percent.]{.underline}** But [lower- and middle-class incomes in the
United States and Europe remained flat,]{.underline} jobs in some
sectors there fled abroad, and the [global financial system became much
more fragile.]{.underline} This sorry record is why, in 2016, when Trump
called U.S. foreign policy \"a complete and total disaster\" and blamed
out-of-touch and unaccountable elites, many [Americans]{.underline}
nodded in agreement. They were not isolationists; they simply [wanted
their government to stop trying to run the world and pay more attention
to problems at home.]{.underline} Trump\'s predecessors seemed to have
heard that message, at least when they were running for office. In 1992,
Clinton\'s mantra was \"It\'s the economy, stupid.\" In 2000, [Bush
derided Clinton\'s efforts at \"nation building]{.underline}\" and
called for a foreign policy that was \"strong but humble.\" [Obama
pledged to end foreign wars and focus on \"nation building at
home.\"]{.underline} These expressions of restraint were understandable,
as surveys had repeatedly shown that a majority of Americans believed
the country was playing the role of global policeman more than it should
and doing more than its share to help others. According to the Pew
Research Center, in 2013[, 80 percent of Americans agreed that \"we
should not think so much in international terms but concentrate more on
our own national problems and building up our strength and prosperity
here at home,\"]{.underline} and 83 percent wanted presidents to focus
more on domestic issues than on foreign policy. Clinton, Bush, and Obama
all understood what the American people wanted. But they failed to
deliver it. So has Trump. Although his Twitter feed and public
statements often question familiar orthodoxies, **[the United States is
still defending wealthy nato allies, still fighting in Afghanistan,
still chasing terrorists across Africa, still giving unconditional
support to the same problematic Middle Eastern clients, and still hoping
to topple a number of foreign regimes.]{.underline}** Trump\'s style as
president is radically different from those of his predecessors, but
[the substance of his policies is surprisingly similar. The result is
the worst of both worlds: **Washington is still pursuing a misguided
grand strategy, but now with an incompetent vulgarian in the White
House.**]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Porter

#### Hegemonic stability theory relies on [a bloodless retelling of history]{.underline} that obscures countless violent conquests -- their nostalgic investment in unipolarity is a product of [neoconservative]{.underline} think-tank specialists with confirmation bias -- means you should [hold their evidence with suspicion]{.underline}

**Porter 18** (Professor Patrick Porter is the Chair of Strategic

The Claim: The Liberal Order Is under Assault The prospect of major
change in the international system is attracting a new wave of
literature about "world order." [Recent crises]{.underline} and
political revolts [have prompted security experts on both sides of the
Atlantic to announce the coming of end times]{.underline}. The rise of
pernicious "isms" --- economic protectionism, authoritarian nationalism,
political tribalism, superpower unilateralism --- has triggered these
fears, along with the gauntlets being thrown down by revisionist powers
threatening U.S. hegemony in the Persian Gulf, Eastern Europe, and Asia.
In the United States, the focal point of this eschatology is [the
presidency of Donald Trump]{.underline}. After the election of an
erratic, coarse demagogue to the nation's highest office in November
2016, security experts [lamented the passing of]{.underline} a postwar
structure that civilized international life, presided over by [a benign
American hegemon.]{.underline} What is being threatened? The objects of
anxiety are a "liberal world order," which allegedly held sway for 70
years, and even the end of "the West" itself. The life of this order is
normally periodized from the end of World War II in 1945 to the recent
past. [As the storyline goes, the United States as benevolent hegemon
designed and underwrote a "global, rules-based" economic and security
order]{.underline} that transformed the world.6 After its chief
competitor, the Soviet Union, collapsed in 1989-1991, it extended this
strategy globally. [Proponents]{.underline} of liberal order [draw on
the logic of hegemonic stability theory]{.underline}.7 According to that
theory, one dominant state exercises such a preponderance of power that
it lessens the insecurities that lead to arms races and spirals of
alarm, enabling other states to ease their security competitions with
neighbors and rivals, relax their arms programs, and focus on economic
growth. More ambitiously, it not only reshapes institutions and markets
but remakes the preferences of other states. [To its admirers, this
order]{.underline}, for all its imperfections, [achieved unprecedented
general peace and prosperity.]{.underline} It was based on a harmony of
interests between the United States and the rest of the world. It made
the world a single system or "whole," as Council on Foreign Relations
president Richard [Haass claims]{.underline}.8 Revision of the order,
and [retreats by the hegemon, will lead to increased
disorder]{.underline}. On the campaign trail Donald Trump explicitly
threatened the status quo. He denounced allies as delinquent and
threatened to shred alliances, tolerate nuclear proliferation, re-erect
tariff walls, and abandon international agreements. To security
traditionalists who oppose Trump, his revisionist challenge accelerates
the collapse of a "liberal order" under a transnational assault by
authoritarian forces. In a state of shock, they seek orientation in an
ahistorical myth about the world before this dark age. As Princeton's
Aaron Friedberg tweeted, "After WWII US built a system of democratic
states, tied together by trade, institutions and common values --- a
liberal order. Now it needs to defend that order against the illiberal
powers it tried to incorporate after the Cold War."9 Historian Jeremy
Suri charges that Trump is plunging the world into a great regression by
"launching a direct attack on the liberal international order that
really made America great." The elements of this order include "a system
of multilateral trade and alliances that we built to serve our interests
and attract others to our way of life." Suri explains: Through the
European Recovery Program (the Marshall Plan), the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization), the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank, among other institutions, the
United States led a postwar capitalist system that raised global
standards of living, defeated Soviet communism, and converted China to a
market economy. Through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
Europe and a web of alliances in Asia and the Middle East, the United
States contained aggressive states, nurtured stable allies, and promoted
democratic reforms when possible.10 **[This]{.underline}** sunny
"highlights package" **[offers a strangely bloodless retelling of
history]{.underline}**. It is a euphemistic rendering of the Cold War
and the actual practice of anti-Soviet containment by the superpower and
its proxies. **[The Bay of Pigs, napalm, East Timor, the shah of Iran,
and the Contras fade into the background]{.underline}**. That this
pristine retelling should come from distinguished historians of American
diplomacy like Friedberg and Suri suggests how seductive the vision of
an earlier and better order has become. Trump, too, is complicit in this
mythmaking. Like his opponents, he frames his own election in stark
terms. Trump speaks of a dark prehistory of "globalism," of open
borders, predatory capitalism, futile wars, and general American
victimhood, and a return to wholesome nationalism, industrial
regeneration, civilizational rebirth, and, of course, making America
"great."11 What was the liberal order, as its defenders define it? If an
"order" is a coming together of power with social purpose, a "world
order" is an international design of institutions, norms, and patterned
relationships that defines the global balance of power.12 Some
commentators argue that for a viable world order to emerge in a time of
turbulence, the United States may have to compromise. Amitav Acharya,
Michael Mazarr, and Henry Kissinger seek to revive the concept of world
order, but unlike those of other "world order" visionaries, their
proposed designs are pluralistic and require the United States to temper
its universalism for the sake of stability and negotiated coexistence in
a polycentric world.13 By contrast, **[the liberal order is a missionary
project that looks to extirpate rival orders and demands the
perpetuation of American dominance]{.underline}**. As an ideal type, the
"liberal order" entails a copious number of norms and institutions,
suggesting that good things go together. In accounts of the postwar
liberal order, many or all of the following features appear, though with
varying emphasis: the rule of law and the supremacy of "rules," humanist
globalism and humanitarian development, free trade, multilateral
cooperation, the security provision of the United States (principally
through its permanent alliances), and a commitment to liberal progress
through the advocacy of democratic and market reforms. Its institutions
span the United Nations, NATO, the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (followed by the World Trade Organization), the IMF,
and the World Bank. A commitment to protocols and the bridging of
divides figure centrally. Hence phrases like "open, rule-based
international economy" abound.14 The "order," proponents argue, embodied
also a pattern of behavior, or, as Jake Sullivan at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace explains, a "system of norms,
institutions, and partnerships" whereby, under the hegemon's
stewardship, collective cooperation trumped competition for relative
advantage, significant shares of sovereignty were ceded for the benefits
of collective action, and a global consensus spread.15 An "illiberal
order" would presumably be the opposite of these things: politically and
economically divided and closed, authoritarian, uncooperative, coercive,
and disrespectful of rules and norms. **[The liberal order is
necessarily hierarchical]{.underline}.** [To speak of liberal order is
to speak also of American primacy]{.underline}, with the former
depending on the exercise of the latter. **[Nostalgists]{.underline}**
do not deny that the American superpower upheld it partly through
overwhelming military strength. However, they **[emphasize the nonbloody
uses of force]{.underline}**, [for example, deterring and dissuading
adversaries, reassuring and uniting allies, and preventing
conflict]{.underline}. And [they stress the consensual, attractive
quality of American hegemony]{.underline}. [Postwar continental Europe
therefore stands out as a favorite area of emphasis]{.underline}, as an
"empire by invitation."16 [Most anxious observers agree that a
significant "fall" is occurring.]{.underline}17 To explain it, they
weigh heavily an alleged loss of political will within the West. Leading
theorists of liberal order, such as Princeton's G. John Ikenberry, have
long warned that "the hallmarks of liberal internationalism --- openness
and rule-based relations enshrined in institutions such as the United
Nations and norms such as multilateralism --- could give way to a more
contested and fragmented system of blocs, spheres of influence,
mercantilist networks, and regional rivalries."18 Once optimistic that
the order would withstand geopolitical challenges and prove resilient,
[Ikenberry]{.underline} now [fears a different kind of insurgent threat,
flowing not from hostile subversive states but from within]{.underline}.
Working- and middle-class populations, he suggests, may lose faith in
the order as democracy degenerates.19 Similar complaints have arisen
across the Atlantic. [Warnings against U.S. disengagement are a staple
of rhetoric from security thinkers]{.underline} in allied countries.20
For Robin Niblett, director of the internationalist Chatham House, Trump
replicates and feeds on the destructive forces that powered "Brexit,"
forcing liberalism into retreat.21 For the University of Exeter's Doug
Stokes, as for Ikenberry and Niblett, domestic discontent may unravel
the worldwide arrangements that best served America's "globalized"
interests. For the old order to reproduce itself, it must make a new
settlement with the American working class.22 [Most of these diagnoses
have a common premise]{.underline}. **[All offer an upbeat, potted
history of the world]{.underline}** created in and after 1945. Many
**[then blame the crumbling of that world on agents or forces that are
separate from it]{.underline}**.23 [If the order is
perishing]{.underline}, they argue, [it is being assassinated rather
than dying from its internal failures.]{.underline} **[They have little
to say about the significant reverses]{.underline}** that occurred while
the order reigned. These included some of **[America's most disastrous
wars, geopolitical chaos in the Persian Gulf]{.underline}** from the
Iran-Iraq War to the present sectarian breakdown, **[resurgent jihadi
Islamism, the greatest act of urban terrorism]{.underline}** committed
by a nonstate actor in history, **[the eurozone crisis, the economic
regression of Russia]{.underline}** under "shock therapy," [mounting and
unsustainable debt, the global financial crisis, the entrenchment and
immobility of wealth, and the growing underclass of working
poor.]{.underline} Rather than attributing to the old order the failures
that occurred on its watch, nostalgists blame mismanagement, or popular
fatigue, or "populism" and demagogues that whipped up mass discontent.
**[They give credit to the order and U.S. primacy for benign
developments, discounting other possible contributors such as the
deterrent effects of nuclear weapons or the memory of World War
II.]{.underline}** That the order may have been complicit in its own
undoing is hardly considered. [Nostalgia for a lost order]{.underline}
is not just the complaint of self-styled liberal internationalists of
any particular faction. It [has a wider provenance among those who
believe today's choice lies between continuing American primacy and
chaos]{.underline}. The strength of the consensus is reflected in a
Brookings Institution paper, coauthored by former high-ranking
[officials]{.underline} in the administrations of George W. Bush and
Barack Obama, urging the White House to revert to a traditional posture,
upholding an order favoring openness, human rights, and peace, and
[claim]{.underline}ing [that this is the only viable grand strategy for
the United States.]{.underline}24 The hawkish intellectual **[Robert
Kagan]{.underline}** argues that the order established after World War
II was a "liberal enlightenment project" that is now "challenged by
forces from within and without," not only because of popular fatigue
with the burdens of international leadership but because Americans have
forgotten the reasons their country adopted the role as the world's
guarantor and stabilizer.25 Primacists such as **[Robert Lieber, Thomas
Wright, and Eliot Cohen issue similar warnings]{.underline}**.26 **[The
prominence of neoconservatives among this chorus is
ironic]{.underline}**. Critics once accused neoconservatives of
violating the principles of liberal order with their bellicose
unilateralism, by agitating for preventive war in Iraq in March 2003
without an explicit UN mandate, and by justifying torture. But [this
reflects the paradoxical problem at the heart of liberal "world
ordering."]{.underline} On the one hand, [under most popular
visions]{.underline} of liberal order, [the hegemon creates a world
based on deference to institutions and rules]{.underline}. [But actual
international life includes hostile, noncooperative forces that refuse
to defer]{.underline}. **[Thus the liberal order includes conflicting
rather than complementary rules and principles]{.underline}**. It
contains "veto players" like Russia or China with different conceptions
of order. The protection and enforcement of such an order, and the
enforcer's own preponderance, rests upon selection and the exercise of a
hegemon's privilege. Liberal world orders typically involve several
impulses, namely, internationalism, integration, and imperialism.27 That
last, imperialism, is the most contentious. Historically, world orders,
with their trading protocols and monetary regimes, and control of sea
lanes, commercial routes, and access to raw materials, are designed and
imposed by the strong. The opening of Asian markets, a celebrated
feature of liberal order, was also a pre-1945 byproduct of violent and
imperial coercion, imposed on China by Great Britain through the Opium
Wars and on Japan by American Commodore Matthew Perry with the threat of
naval bombardment in 1853-1854. **[Proponents of liberal order
occasionally admit that]{.underline}** what is sometimes framed
straightforwardly as **[a rule-bound order is in fact a system of
imperial power]{.underline}** (and vigilante privilege) **[exercised by
a hegemon.]{.underline}** [Robert Cooper]{.underline}, the former
diplomat and [adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair, argued that if the
world had a civilized core that deserved lawful conduct, there was also
a barbarous periphery that warranted "rougher methods]{.underline} of an
earlier era."28 "Among themselves," he wrote, "the postmodern states
operate on the basis of laws and open co-operative security" but "in the
jungle, one must use the laws of the jungle."29 One-time advocate of
American empire Michael Ignatieff admitted that being an imperial power
"means enforcing such order as there is in the world and doing so in the
American interest. It means laying down the rules America wants (on
everything from markets to weapons of mass destruction) while exempting
itself from other rules (the Kyoto Protocol on climate change and the
International Criminal Court) that go against its interest."30 [At the
height of the war on terror, jurists advising the George W. Bush
administration used a similar logic to justify the suspension of the
rule of law and Geneva conventions.]{.underline}31 **[One can defend
these inconsistencies as necessary, or not. That they continually recur
suggests that liberal "world ordering" is an inescapably compromised
process. The United States is an imperial power,]{.underline}** even if
it is distinct from former empires. [It may lack the land hunger of
empires past]{.underline} and look different from European or Asian
imperialisms. It was averse to formal annexation, refused to claim the
mantle of empire, and made a succession of retreats, from Vietnam,
Lebanon, and Iraq. [But it still throws its weight around in imperial
ways: through coercion, subversion, or patronage, it penetrates the
sovereign autonomy]{.underline} [of other states]{.underline} to
constrain their choices. The political economy underlying American
interventions was at times coercive, as in the structural-adjustment
programs visited on developing countries from Eastern Europe to Latin
America. Leading primacists who speak up for liberal world ordering have
earlier acknowledged that [the American project overseas must
be]{.underline} necessarily imperial, albeit in this case of a
distinctively informal "American" kind, [involving the forceful
suppression of revolt, hard-nosed enforcement of parameters around other
states' policies, and the exercise of unequal bargaining
influence]{.underline}.32 But for the most part, [**today's lamentations
for a dying liberal order do not acknowledge the necessarily imperial
component. This is the imperialism that does not know itself.**
Invocations of the liberal world order have become the ritualized
language of the foreign policy establishment]{.underline}. In the
academy, there is a well-established scholarly study of "world
orders."33 But too often, especially among **[think-tank specialists and
the foreign policy commentariat]{.underline}**, the liberal order's
admirers **[assert what they ought to prove.]{.underline}** In that
respect, President Trump's former deputy assistant for strategic
communications at the National Security Council, Michael Anton, was
right to argue that [the foreign policy establishment has become a
"priesthood,"]{.underline} fonder of recapitulation than
argumentation.34 [It repeats its axioms but neglects to ground its
vision in a careful reading of history]{.underline} or the present. A
good example is an article by Edward Luce in June 2017, mourning the
internal defeat of Western liberalism and a new world "disorder." To
demonstrate the imminence of disorder under Trump, Luce did not examine
what Trump was actually doing beyond the decision to withdraw from the
Paris climate change agreement, which is not an unprecedented pullback.
The many Trump administration moves that have affronted Moscow go
unmentioned: for example, the reinforcement of NATO through increased
funding of the European Reassurance Initiative; and the bombing of the
Assad regime, Putin's ally, in April 2017. Instead, Luce cited the
statements of two allies who were wondering where Trump's behavior would
lead, gossip about personality clashes in Trump's court, and
corroborating statements from other **[figures in the foreign policy
establishment]{.underline}** who **[take the "liberal order" as an
article of faith, betraying a confirmation bias]{.underline}**. Without
evidence, he then accused President Obama of "global retrenchment."35
Typical of the genre, Luce contrasted these recent failures with the
postwar internationalism and institution building of President Harry
Truman. To be reprimanded for violating established norms of American
"global leadership," against the exalted standards of Truman, is an
occupational burden that comes with the presidency. Before Trump,
critics had accused presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama of
retreating from a long-standing commitment to a liberal world order. The
charge that Washington is abandoning a noble Trumanite diplomatic past
is less an observation than a political predisposition, substantively
shallow yet part of the framework within which debate is conducted.
International history after 1945 is more fraught.

[Morally, Americans must]{.underline} also [consider]{.underline}
something else: [Risking conflict to deny great powers a sphere of

[to]{.underline} easing the crisis on [the Korean
peninsula]{.underline}. No matter what he tells Trump, Kim Jong Un is
unlikely to give up his nuclear weapons. But [preventing further
nuclear]{.underline} and missile [tests would reduce the chances of
war]{.underline} [and facilitate]{.underline} the
[reconciliation]{.underline} [with South Korea]{.underline} that could
improve North Korean lives. [The U.S.]{.underline} can't do that alone.
It can tempt Kim by promising an end to North Korea's diplomatic and
economic isolation. But it can't fully reassure him that the United
States---which [turned on Qaddafi after he abandoned his own nuclear
program]{.underline}---won't do the same to him. [Only Beijing---North
Korea's longtime ally---can do that]{.underline}. [The more protected
North Korea feels by China, the less it may feel the need to advance its
nuclear program]{.underline}. The Naval War College's Lyle Goldstein has
suggested that Pyongyang might be more likely to permit inspection of
its nuclear program if China takes part. [This defies the logic of
unipolarity, which mandates that the U.S. try to reduce China's
influence]{.underline} on the Korean peninsula. But here, too,
**[America can better serve the cause of peace and human dignity by
cooperating with great powers than seeking to supplant
them.]{.underline}** What america needs from its foreign policy has not
changed since the nation's founding: to promote the external conditions
that give Americans the best chance to become prosperous and free. What
has changed, at key moments, is the strategy the United States pursues
to realize those goals. In the early-19th century, via the Monroe
Doctrine, the United States entered a de facto alliance with
Britain---the world's greatest naval power---to prevent Europe's land
powers from establishing beachheads in the Americas. Beginning in the
early-20th century, as Britain's ability to enforce the Monroe Doctrine
waned, the United States entered two European wars, and then fought the
Cold War, to prevent adversaries from dominating Europe and Asia. Now,
to achieve its enduring goals, [America needs to change
strategy]{.underline} once again. The unipolar strategy that America has
pursued since the Soviet Union's demise---of preserving if not extending
American dominance in every region of the world---is increasingly
insolvent. It is insolvent because [America lacks the power to quell
uprisings in the countries it has invaded]{.underline}. It is insolvent
because [America lacks the power to deny Russian influence over the
countries on its border.]{.underline} It is insolvent because [America
lacks the power to enforce a status quo in East Asia]{.underline}
established when China's economy was slightly larger than Holland's.
And, [above all]{.underline}, it is insolvent because **[it lacks
support from the American people, who]{.underline}** for good reason
largely **[do not believe it has served their needs.]{.underline}** In
this regard, [Trump's election]{.underline}---which followed
anti-interventionist rebellions by Ross Perot, Jerry Brown, Pat
Buchanan, Ralph Nader, Ron Paul, and Bernie Sanders---[was a disastrous
response to a legitimate and enduring discontent]{.underline}. The
choice facing Democrats in the Trump era is whether to join a hawkish
alliance that aims to suppress that discontent or whether to channel it
in a progressive direction. Hawks will denounce any foreign policy that
abandons unipolarity as defeatist, a harbinger of national decline. But
the progressive activists remaking the Democratic Party suspect, with
good reason, that [the pursuit of global dominance has been not an
alternative to national decline but one of its causes]{.underline}.
[If]{.underline} in the coming years those activists articulate an
agenda for shielding the republic---in which [the U.S.]{.underline}
protects the dignity and freedoms of its people, grants other powerful
nations deference near their borders, and [works with them to the solve
the common problems that plague humanity]{.underline}---[they will not
be retreating]{.underline} [from America's best foreign-policy
traditions]{.underline}. They will be ushering in their long overdue
return.

### Impact -- Cyber War

\"**[The Islamic Republic of Iran and China are standing in a united
front,\"]{.underline}** claimed Iran's ICT Minister Mohammad Javad Azari
Jahromi last week, **[\"to confront U.S. unilateralism and hegemony in
the field of IT.\"]{.underline}** [For confront read \"offensive
actions,\" and for IT read \"cyber.\"]{.underline} Jahromi followed this
with similar comments in Beijing a few days later, when he met his
opposite number Miao Wei. [The ministers discussed \"common challenges\"
in the face of \"U.S. unilateralism,\" of which Jahromi said, "we are
facing similar challenges, so we need to find common
solutions]{.underline}.\" The Iranian minister accused [the U.S. of
\"spreading its hegemony on new strategic technologies such as
artificial intelligence]{.underline},\" and criticized Washington\'s
actions against Huawei and ZTE. **[Miao Wei reportedly stressed that
cooperation between the two countries would help tackle \"such threats
and pressures.\"]{.underline}** According to Iran\'s state media, [the
ministers \"discussed ways to boost cooperation in the field of
information technology and countering threats in
cyberspace]{.underline}---and agreed to establish a joint workgroup to
survey and counter those threats.\" In May, Chinese Foreign Minister
Wang Yi told the media after meeting his Iranian counterpart Mohammad
Javad Zarif, that \"[China is strongly opposed to U.S. unilateral
sanctions and its prejudgments. China understands Iran's conditions and
concerns and safeguards its legitimate interests.\"]{.underline}
Although some of the language can be interpreted as referencing
mainstream, non-military IT interests, **[the context is entirely
cybersecurity related and comes as tensions continue to intensify and
the cyber domain becomes ever more important.]{.underline}** Putting any
theoretical risk from North Korea---handshakes included---to one side,
**[the greatest threats to the security of the U.S. and its allies come
from Russia, China and Iran. The same is true when it comes to
cybersecurity---China and Russia have long been the world\'s greatest
villains, but Iran fancies a seat at that table.]{.underline}** From a
military perspective, there are clear links. [Russia supplies weapons
and proxy sponsorship to the Middle East, and China is now reportedly
eyeing a more significant military role in the region. China and Russia
have also both blamed the U.S. for its escalating tensions with
Iran.]{.underline} Meanwhile, the continued integration of cyber and
conventional warfare has been thrust into the headlines this year, also
in the Middle East. [Israel launched a missile strike to retaliate for
an offensive cyber strike, while the U.S. did the opposite, responding
to Teheran\'s downing of a surveillance drone with a cyber strike
against the country\'s missile control systems.]{.underline} In the
conventional domain, **[spillover from the battlefield into the real
world comes in the form of insurgency and terrorism.]{.underline}** It
is difficult to plan and execute and it usually fails. In [the cyber
domain, attacks can be mounted on soft targets worldwide with relative
ease. Iran is learning this fast]{.underline}. The warning issued by
U.S. Cyber Command in the wake of its strike on Iran was to Outlook
users that a (likely) [Iranian hack was targeting millions of unpatched
systems. Iran doesn\'t need to counter hard targets to hit
back.]{.underline} Last month, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) within the DHS issued a blanket warning [about a
\"recent rise in malicious cyber activity directed at United States
industries and government agencies by Iranian regime actors and
proxies\... **using destructive 'wiper' attacks, looking to do much more
than just steal data and money.\"**]{.underline} CISA warned [that
\"these efforts are often enabled through common tactics like spear
phishing, password spraying, and credential stuffing]{.underline}. What
might start as an account compromise, where you think you might just
lose data, can quickly become a situation where you've lost your whole
network.\" Also last month, the National Security Agency confirmed that
\"**[there have been serious issues with malicious Iranian cyber actions
in the past. In these times of heightened tensions, it is appropriate
for everyone to be alert to signs of Iranian aggression in cyberspace
and ensure appropriate defenses are in place.\"]{.underline}** And it\'s
not just the U.S. The U.K. blamed Iran for a concerted cyber attack last
December on major government and commercial organizations. Iran\'s
ability to retaliate against the U.S. government is limited, but
[Teheran has proven to be ultimate pragmatists when it comes to finding
ways to tackle the threat of the U.S. Lining up China\'s cyber support
would certainly fit that bill.]{.underline} Offensive cyber capabilities
have long been the most sensitive and nationalistic of government
activities, clouded in secrecy and deniability**[. If Iran finds Beijing
open for business, beyond rhetoric and public support, and can genuinely
tap into China\'s expertise to become the ultimate cyber proxy against
the U.S., the dynamics of that particular conflict will change
significantly.]{.underline}**

### Impact -- Democracy

**[The]{.underline}** harsh **[necessity of abandoning "human rights"
and other "sentimental" and "unreal objectives" was]{.underline}**
especially **[pressing in the global South]{.underline}**, what used to
be known as the Third World. **[Washington assigned the]{.underline}**
vast "**[undeveloped]{.underline}**" **[periphery of the world
capitalist system]{.underline}**---**[Africa, Latin America, Southeast
Asia and]{.underline}** the **[energy-rich and]{.underline}** thus
strategically **[hyper-significant Middle East]{.underline}**---**[a
less than flattering role]{.underline}**. It was **[to]{.underline}**
"**[fulfill]{.underline}** its major **[function as a source of raw
materials and]{.underline}** a **[market]{.underline}**" (actual State
Department language) for the great industrial (capitalist) nations
(excluding socialist Russia and its satellites, and notwithstanding the
recent epic racist-fascist rampages of industrial Germany and Japan). It
was to be exploited both for the benefit of U.S. corporations/investors
and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous U.S.
trading and investment partners organized on capitalist principles and
hostile to the Soviet bloc. "**[Democracy]{.underline}**"
**[was]{.underline}** fine as **[a slogan and benevolent]{.underline}**,
**[idealistic-sounding mission statement]{.underline}** when it came
**[to marketing]{.underline}** this **[imperialist U.S.
policy]{.underline}** at home and abroad. Since most people in the
"third" or "developing" world had no interest in neocolonial
subordination to the rich nations and subscribed to what U.S.
intelligence officials considered the heretical "idea that government
has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people" (what U.S.
planners called "communism"), Washington's real-life commitment to
popular governance abroad was strictly qualified, to say the least.
"Democracy" was suitable to the U.S. as long as its outcomes comported
with the interests of U.S. investors/corporations and related U.S.
geopolitical objectives. It had to be abandoned, undermined and/or
crushed when it threatened those investors/corporations and the broader
imperatives of business rule to any significant degree.
**[As]{.underline}** President Richard **[Nixon's coldblooded national
security adviser]{.underline}** Henry **[Kissinger
explained]{.underline}** in June 1970, **[three years before the U.S.
sponsored a bloody fascist coup that overthrew Chile's democratically
elected socialist president]{.underline}**, Salvador Allende: "**[I
don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist
because of]{.underline}** the **[irresponsibility]{.underline}** of its
own people." The U.S.-sponsored coup government that murdered Allende
would kill tens of thousands of real and alleged leftists with
Washington's approval. The Yankee superpower sent some of its leading
neoliberal economists and policy advisers to help the blood-soaked
Pinochet regime turn Chile into a "free market" model and to help Chile
write capitalist oligarchy into its national constitution. "Since 1945,
by deed and by example," the great Australian author, commentator and
filmmaker John Pilger wrote nearly nine years ago: "**[The U.S. has
overthrown 50 governments]{.underline}**, **[including
democracies]{.underline}**, **[crushed]{.underline}** some **[30
liberation movements and supported tyrannies from Egypt to
Guatemala]{.underline}** (see William Blum's histories). **[Bombing is
apple pie.]{.underline}**" Along the way, **[Washington
has]{.underline}** crassly **[interfered in elections in dozens of
"sovereign" nations]{.underline}**, something curious to note in light
of current liberal U.S. outrage over real or alleged Russian
interference in "our" supposedly democratic electoral process in 2016.
**[Uncle Sam also]{.underline}** has **[bombed civilians in 30
countries]{.underline}**, **[attempted to assassinate foreign leaders
and deployed chemical and biological weapons]{.underline}**. **[If
we]{.underline}** "**[consider only Latin America since the
1950s]{.underline}**," **[writes]{.underline}** the
**[sociologist]{.underline}** Howard **[Waitzkin]{.underline}**:
**[\[T\]he United States has used direct military
invasion]{.underline}** or has supported military coups **[to overthrow
elected governments in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, Chile, Haiti,
Grenada, and Panama.]{.underline}** In addition, **[the United States
has intervened with military action to suppress revolutionary movements
in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Bolivia.]{.underline}** More recently ...
**[the United States has spent tax dollars to finance and help organize
opposition groups and media in Honduras, Paraguay, and
Brazil]{.underline}**, **[leading to congressional impeachments of
democratically elected presidents.]{.underline}** Hillary Clinton
presided over these efforts as Secretary of State in the Obama
administration, which pursued the same pattern of destabilization in
Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia. **[The death count
resulting from "American Era" U.S. foreign policy runs well into the
many millions]{.underline}**, **[including]{.underline}** possibly **[as
many as 5 million Indochinese killed]{.underline}** by **[Uncle Sam and
his agents]{.underline}** and allies **[between 1962 and
1975.]{.underline}** The flat-out **[barbarism of the American war on
Vietnam is]{.underline}** widely **[documented]{.underline}** on record.
The infamous My Lai massacre of March 16, 1968, when U.S. Army soldiers
slaughtered more than 350 unarmed civilians---including terrified women
holding babies in their arms---in South Vietnam was no isolated incident
in the U.S. "crucifixion of Southeast Asia" (Noam Chomsky's phrase at
the time). U.S. Army Col. Oran Henderson, who was charged with covering
up the massacre, candidly told reporters that "every unit of brigade
size has its My Lai hidden somewhere." It is difficult, sometimes, to
wrap one's mind around the extent of the savagery Uncle Sam has
unleashed on the world to advance and maintain its global supremacy. In
the early 1950s, the Harry Truman administration responded to an early
challenge to **[U.S. power in Northern Korea with a practically
genocidal three-year bombing campaign]{.underline}** that was
**[described in soul-numbing terms]{.underline}** by the Washington Post
years ago: The bombing was long, leisurely and merciless, even by the
assessment of America's own leaders. '**[Over a period of three years or
so]{.underline}**, **[we killed]{.underline}** off---what---**[20
percent of the population]{.underline}**,' Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay,
head of the Strategic Air Command during the Korean War, told the Office
of Air Force History in 1984. Dean Rusk, a supporter of the war and
later Secretary of State, said the United States bombed 'everything that
moved in North Korea, every brick standing on top of another.' After
running low on urban targets, U.S. bombers destroyed hydroelectric and
irrigation dams in the later stages of the war, flooding farmland and
destroying crops ... **[\[T\]he U.S. dropped 635,000 tons of explosives
on North Korea]{.underline}**, including 32,557 tons of napalm, an
incendiary liquid that can clear forested areas and cause devastating
burns to human skin. Gee, why does North Korea fear and hate Uncle Sam?
This ferocious bombardment, **[which killed 2 million or more
civilians]{.underline}**, began five years after Truman arch-criminally
and unnecessarily ordered the atom bombing of hundreds of thousands pf
civilians in Hiroshima and Nagasaki to warn the Soviet Union to stay out
of Japan and Western Europe.

### Impact -- Econ

#### US hegemony encourages economic challenges which exacerbate economic tensions with China and risk the global economy. Chinese economic hegemony is good and US economic hegemony is declining.

China's challenges to US hegemony In light of the power transition
perspective, [the three most recent examples of China's challenges to US
hegemony in the world are the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the
creation of the AIIB, and Beijing's plan for "Made in China
2025."]{.underline} First of all, China's BRI, which is also called the
"[One Belt, One Road]{.underline}" Initiative or the Initiative of "the
Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road," [is
Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature project]{.underline}. The BRI
was first announced in 2013 when Xi visited Central and Southeast Asia.
[It seeks to connect Asia, Africa and Europe to promote regional
economic cooperation, infrastructure construction, and world
peace]{.underline}. It was motivated by "the Silk Road Spirit" (i.e.
peace and cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and
mutual benefit) of more than two millennia ago that is, China claims, "a
historic and cultural heritage shared by all countries around the world"
(The State Council of the Republic of China, 2015). According to the
"Action Plan on the Belt and Road Initiative" published jointly by the
National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, and the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), accelerating the
construction [of the BRI "can help promote the economic prosperity of
the countries along the Belt and Road and regional economic cooperation,
strengthen exchanges and mutual learning between different
civilizations, and promote world peace and development]{.underline}"
(The State Council of the Republic of China, 2015). Hence, Beijing
contends that BRI "is a great undertaking that will benefit people
around the world" (The State Council of the Republic of China, 2015).
The BRI currently includes about 70 countries that accounts for 70
percent of the world's population, 55 percent of the world's Gross
National Product and 75 percent of global energy reserves (Cavanna,
2018). Many countries in the world (e.g. "from Panama to Madagascar,
South Africa to New Zealand" (Kuo and Kommenda, 2018)) have officially
pledged support for the BRI. Second, the [AIIB is a China-led
multilateral development bank,]{.underline} which was originally
launched by Chinese President Xi in 2003. Among others, Beijing's
frustration with the slow reform process of economic governance in the
aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008, its intention to
[popularize the Renminbi]{.underline} (China's currency) [as a global
reserve currency, and its hope to increase its voice in global financial
institutions were the important motivations of the creation of the
AIIB]{.underline}. With \$100bn of initial capital, the AIIB,
headquartered in Beijing, officially came into operation in January
2016. The stated main goal of the AIIB was to "improve social and
economic outcomes in Asia" (AIIB, 2018a) by providing finance to the
various infrastructure projects of the region's developing countries.
Beijing claims that [AIIB-funded projects will better connect people,
markets and services to promote sustainable growth, development, and
prosperity (]{.underline}AIIB, 2018b). Along with the New Development
Bank (NDB),\[7\] which is formally called the BRICS (Brazil, Russia,
India, China, South Africa) Development Bank headquartered in Shanghai,
and Chinese lending institutions such as the Silk Road Fund and Chinese
policy banks, the launch of the AIIB represents China's major financial
initiatives that could rival US-led multilateral institutions. As of
October 2018, the AIIB has 87 approved members (68 members and 19
prospective members) around the world and its total investment amounts
up to \$6.4bn. As Tekdal (2017, p. 375) notes, although the AIIB has no
official link to the BRI, a primary motivation of its creation was to
fund projects in BRI partner countries. As an emerging economic hegemon,
which is dissatisfied with the global economic governance in which its
voting share in the existing multilateral institutions like the IMF, the
World Bank, the Asian Development Bank does not match its economic power
as the world's second largest economy and the world's biggest trading
nation, China's initiatives of the BRI, the AIIB and the NDB demonstrate
its long-term goal of reshaping the global economic order. [Third, "Made
in China 2025" is Beijing's ten-year industrial development
plan]{.underline}. First, announced and approved by China's State
Council in 2015, it [is "a blueprint for Beijing's plan to transform the
country into a high-tech powerhouse that dominates advanced industries
like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and new energy
vehicles]{.underline}" (Laskai , 2018). By enhancing Chinese industries'
competitiveness and innovation and reducing China's dependence on
foreign technology through achieving 40 percent of domestically
manufactured basic components and basic materials by 2020 and 70 percent
of self-sufficiency in core components and basic materials in industries
like aerospace equipment and telecommunication equipment by 2025
(Morrison, 2018, p. 47; Laskai, 2018), [its goal is to make China a
manufacturing superpower that dominates the world market in future
high-tech industries. Indeed]{.underline}, while the term "Made in
China" has typically meant cheap products such as clothing, shoes and
consumer electronics with low quality, "Made in China 2025" intends to
turn China into an independent and cutting-edge technology-driven
economy. Beijing believes that by moving toward higher value-added
high-tech industries, they could escape the so-called "middle-income
trap that has plagued many developing countries" (Hopewell, 2018) with
the problems of increased wages and low productivity. US efforts to
prolong US hegemony [China's initiatives of the BRI, the AIIB and Made
in China 2025 certainly threaten the global hegemony of the USA, which
is now over seven decades.]{.underline} Layne (2018, p. 96) points out
that "Since the onset of the Great Recession,\[8\] [China has
successively taken top position in the world in exports
(passing]{.underline} Germany); [in trade]{.underline} (passing the
USA); [and in manufacturing]{.underline} (claiming a title the USA had
held for a century)." Based on these facts, he argues that t**[he Great
Recession and the rapid rise of China as a leading economic power have
demonstrated the reality of American decline -- i.e. the end of the
unipolar era or Pax Americana]{.underline}**\[9\] (Layne, 2012, p. 204).
[Although China repeatedly claims that it does not seek to replace US
hegemony in the world, its behavior revealed by the initiatives of the
BRI, the AIIB and Made in China 2015 illustrates that its ultimate goal
is to be a global hegemon]{.underline}\[10\]. This is not surprising
because all the rising powers in history invariably sought to first
dominate the region they are situated (Mearsheimer, 2011, 2014) and
expand their power globally (Gilpin, 1981). Given that "[It is more
difficult for the leaders of a declining hegemon to accept the reality
or prospect of their country's diminished influence and
status"]{.underline} (Chan, 2008, p. 50), **[the USA has every reason to
prolong its hegemony in the post-1945 world, which has served its own
interests]{.underline}** (Layne, 2018, p. 105). **[These efforts to
maintain US hegemony are well observed in the case of American
actions]{.underline}** against China's initiatives of the BRI, the AIIB
and Made in China 2015. First of all, despite China's claim that the BRI
aims to promote world peace and development, [many analysts in
Washington view it as a Chinese version of Marshall Plan that seeks to
boost Chinese investment around the world for global
dominance.]{.underline} They think that as "a top-level design for which
the central government has mobilized the country's political,
diplomatic, intellectual, economic and financial resources" (Rolland,
2018[), the BRI is Beijing's "attempt to remake global commerce on
China's terms and project Chinese power far and wide"]{.underline}
(Chellaney, 2018). As the BRI expands in scope[, it could give China too
much leverage and control over other countries, especially those that
are small and poor]{.underline} (Kuo and Kommenda, 2018). Also, by
making China a major hub of global investment, trade, and finance, [the
BRI contributes to build a Chinese version of hub-and-spoke network
system]{.underline}. Thus, [Harry Harris, head of US Pacific
Command]{.underline} Admiral, argued in early 2018 that the BRI is "a
concerted, strategic endeavor by China to gain a foothold and displace
the USA and our allies and partners in the region" (Harris, 2018).
Moreover, given ["almost all the ports and other transport
infrastructure being built can be dual-use for commercial and military
purposes"]{.underline} [the BRI is regarded]{.underline} not simply as
China's plan to build roads and railways across Eurasia and Africa or
the Indo-Pacific, but **[as Beijing's grand strategy for the next
decades and its vehicle to write new rules that reflect Chinese
interests]{.underline}** (Kuo and Kommenda, 2018). Indeed, Beijing has
made a link between the BRI and the concept of China's core national
security interests. For example, Wei Fendge, China's Defense Minister,
told Pakistan's Navy chief in 2018 that "[China was ready to provide
security guarantees for the One Belt, One Road project]{.underline}"
(Smith, 2018). Therefore, Eisenman contends that with no exact
definition of its scope and contents, [the BRI is China's attempt to
"create a new Sinocentric era of globalization using both traditional
tools of Chinese statecraft]{.underline} as well as new types of
economic incentives and debt financing arrangements" (Eisenman, 2018).
In other words, the BRI reflects China's increasing relative power in
the world as well as growing Beijing's ambitions to shape global
economic governance (Tekdal, 2017, p. 378). It "exemplifies how China is
flaunting its global ambitions" (Chellaney, 2018). As the BRI is
increasingly seen as a major source of China's political and economic
influence of the world, [US policy makers have expressed their
concerns\[11\] and have begun to take some measures against
it]{.underline}. For example, the **[USA, along with Japan and India,
have discussed trilateral efforts to foster infrastructure development
in the Indo-Pacific region since 2015.]{.underline}** In particular, the
[Trump Administration has sought to create a development finance
mechanism, which is designed to counter the negative effects of the
BRI]{.underline}. It has also begun to explore ways to become more
proactive in promoting regional connectivity and infrastructure
initiatives in partnership with Japan. Moreover, reviving their
Quadrilateral Strategic Dialogue in November 2017, the USA, together
with Japan, Australia and India, discussed not only the need to foster a
new vision for regional infrastructure but also the need to further
support the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank in order to
enhance lending for infrastructure projects in the region. Furthermore,
the joint statement released after the meeting between the US President
Trump and India's Prime Minister Modi at the White House in June 2017
made it clear that [the two countries agreed to promote a vision for
regional ties by strengthening "regional economic connectivity through
the transparent development of infrastructure and the use of responsible
debt financing practices, while ensuring respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, the rule of law, and the
environment]{.underline}" (The White House, 2017). This is, in fact, an
announcement by the leaders of the two countries of the vision, which is
completely at odds with the BRI. In addition, [drawing careful attention
to the "neo-colonialist characteristics]{.underline}"\[12\] [of the BRI,
the US--Japan Business Council and the US--India Business Council
jointly launched]{.underline} in May 2018 a new private-sector
initiative, called [the Indo-Pacific Infrastructure Trilateral
Forum]{.underline}, [which aims to insulate sovereign states from
external coercion, support good governance and liberty, promote
market-based economics,]{.underline} and help support quality and
sustainable infrastructure development in the Indo-Pacific region
(Smith, 2018). Likewise, t[he USA sought hard to prevent the creation of
the]{.underline} AIIB. Despite its stated goal of helping to finance the
various infrastructure projects of the developing countries in Asia,
[the USA viewed the AIIB as China's efforts to weaken existing financial
institutions such as the World Bank, the IMF and the Asian Development
Bank, which are largely under the influence of the USA]{.underline} and
its close ally, Japan (Kim, 2018, p. 618; Kim, 2016c, p. 69). Hence**[,
the USA strongly lobbied against the creation of the AIIB.
Washington]{.underline}** even **[pressured its allies not to agree to
the AIIB's creation]{.underline}**. Although US opposition to the AIIB
was reportedly due to US doubts that the AIIB would stick to the same
level of transparency and governance structure as the IMF, the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank, **[the real reason was Washington's
concerns about the shifting balance of power between the USA and
China]{.underline}** (Layne, 2018, p. 103). In any case, US efforts to
prevent a China-led financial institution in Asia miserably failed.
Indeed, despite USA's strong resistance and pressures, the AIIB was
successfully launched and most US allies except Japan (e.g. Germany,
Great Britain, France, Italy, Australia, Israel, South Korea, etc.)
joined the AIIB as its founding members. In total, 57 countries all over
the world participated in the AIIB as its founding members. After all,
China's ability to attract widespread support for the creation of [the
AIIB was seen by Washington as a significant threat to America's global
economic leadership]{.underline} (Layne, 2018, p. 102). By showing that
Washington was not able to keep its allies onside in the face of
Beijing's growing power, the establishment of the [AIIB illustrated that
US economic power in the world is declining whereas China's economic
influence is increasing]{.underline}. To some observers, China's AIIB
initiative and US failure to prevent its creation signaled that "the
Sino-American balance of power now is tilting towards Beijing" (Layne,
2018, p. 103). By the same token, [Washington views China's initiative
of "Made in China 2015" as a very serious challenge to US hegemony in
the world]{.underline}. Since Made in China 2015 calls for achieving
China's self-sufficiency through technology substitution and aims to
transform China into a high-tech powerhouse that dominates advanced
industries[, the USA views it as a real threat to US technological
leadership in the world]{.underline} (Laskai, 2018). According to the US
President Trump, [the Made in China 2025 program unfairly disadvantages
US companies because it involves Chinese government's subsidies and
heavy investments in innovation and research as well as Beijing's
policies to promote the forced technology transfer of US companies in
exchange for obtaining access to the lucrative Chinese
market]{.underline} (Hopewell, 2018). Therefore, he contends that "Made
in China 2025" must be stopped (Landler, 2018). Although the Trump
Administration's policy of [imposing tariffs on foreign steel
affects]{.underline} not only [China]{.underline} but also US allies
like South Korea, its main goal is [to fight China's industrial policy
in high-tech manufacturing sectors such as artificial intelligence,
aerospace, robotics, and energy-saving vehicles.]{.underline} As China's
persistent economic growth brings it into direct competition with the
USA, Trump has explicitly stated that the proposed US tariffs are indeed
designed to impede the program of Made in China 2025 (Hopewell, 2018).
Seen from Beijing, [this sort of US policy appears as if Washington
aimed to "prevent China (from) moving into the industries of the future
so as to ensure continued American dominance of the most profitable
sectors of the global economy, and the most strategically-significant
technologies"]{.underline} (Rachman, 2018). Given that China is the most
serious competitor to the USA in the twenty-first century, the contest
over future industries and technologies underscores the fact that the
Sino--US trade rivalry has important strategic implications (Rachman,
2018). Conclusion [Since the end of the Second World War, the USA has
undoubtedly been a global hegemon]{.underline}. With its preponderant
military and economic strength, it has created a liberal international
economic order and maintained it by promoting global free trade. [USA
sudden turn to protectionism under the banner of "America First" in the
Trump administration illustrates "US fear" that its hegemony or Pax
Americana is declining vis-à-vis China's growing power]{.underline}. It
also demonstrates that the [**USA now seeks to deter China from
overtaking its hegemony so as to keep US hegemony as long as possible.**
Currently, the USA and China are waging a trade war.]{.underline} What
is important to note here is that the driving force of the trade war
between the world's two largest economies is more political than
economic. That is to say, as [China's economic and political influence
in the world vis-à-vis that of the USA increases, US fear about China's
power also grows.]{.underline} Under these circumstances, [Washington
makes every effort to assert its global dominance by deterring China's
challenge to its hegemony]{.underline}\[13\]. **[It is this sort of "US
fear" about hegemonic power transition from Washington to Beijing that
brought about US policies against the BRI, the AIIB, and Made in China
2015.]{.underline}** The fear of hegemonic power transition is indeed a
driving force for the US-launched trade war. Understood this way, **[the
trade war between the USA and China may be a harbinger of a much
larger-scale conflict between the two parties, since as PTT predicts,
war is more likely to occur when the power gap between a declining
hegemon and a rising challenger is getting closed.]{.underline}** As
China's economic, technological, military and political rise continues
down the road, [the USA will try to contain it in order to maintain its
global hegemony]{.underline}. [The obvious consequence of this seesaw
game is the intensification of the Sino--US competition over global
hegemony]{.underline}. The USA and China, the two most powerful states
in the world, appear as if they were on a collision course. What this
means is that **[so long as US fear about China's overtaking US hegemony
persists, a similar type of conflict between the two hegemonic powers is
likely to occur in the future even if the current trade war is
over.]{.underline}**

### Impact -- East Asia

#### American grand strategy of hegemonic force projection in East Asia fails. It's impossible and mischaracterizes China's strategic interests in the region which creates regional and overlapping spheres of influence.

- Says Chinese spheres of influences solve

Washington University. \["Rethinking U.S. Primacy in East Asia," *the

DTS

[American policy in the Western Pacific has long been framed in terms of
preventing the emergence of an exclusive, hostile hegemon that could
threaten vital U.S. interests and deny American access
there.]{.underline} The Trump administration's National Security
Strategy and National Defense Strategy respectively assert that "China
seeks to displace the United States" in East Asia and thus achieve
"Indo-Pacific regional hegemony." Avoiding this possibility has required
Washington, also as a matter of policy, to maintain its own hegemony in
the region (although we prefer to call it "primacy" or "preeminence") as
the best and only guarantee against such a danger. [This mantra was
central to the Obama administration's "rebalance" in East Asia, and
remains central to the Trump administration's advocacy of a "Free and
Open Indo-Pacific."]{.underline} [**But this policy mantra has two
fundamental problems: it mischaracterizes China's strategic intentions
in the region, and it is based on a U.S. strategic objective that is
probably no longer achievable.** First, China is pursuing hegemony in
East Asia, but not an **exclusive hostile hegemony. It is not trying to
extrude the United States from the region**]{.underline} [or deny
American access there. The Chinese have long recognized the
utility]{.underline}---and the benefits to China itself---[of U.S.
engagement with the region]{.underline}, and **[they have indicated
receptivity to peaceful coexistence and overlapping spheres of influence
with the United States there]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[China is not
trying to impose its political or economic system on its
neighbors]{.underline}**, and [it does not seek to obstruct commercial
freedom of navigation in the region]{.underline} (because [no country is
more dependent on freedom of the seas than China itself]{.underline}).
In short, Beijing wants to extend its power and influence within East
Asia, but not as part of a "winner-take-all" contest. China does have
unsettled and vexing sovereignty claims over Taiwan, most of the islands
and other features in the East and South China Seas, and their adjacent
waters. [Although Beijing has demonstrated a willingness to use force in
defense or pursuit of these claims, it is not looking for excuses to
do]{.underline} so. Whether [these disputes can be managed]{.underline}
or resolved in a way that is mutually acceptable [to the relevant
parties and consistent with U.S. interests]{.underline} in the region is
an open, long-term question. But that possibility [should not be ruled
out on the basis of]{.underline}---or made more difficult by---**[false
assumptions of irreconcilable interests]{.underline}**. On the contrary,
it should be pursued on the basis of a recognition that **[all the
parties want to avoid conflict]{.underline}**---and that the
**[sovereignty disputes in the region ultimately are not military
problems requiring military solutions]{.underline}**. And since
[Washington has never been opposed in principle to reunification between
China and Taiwan as long as it is peaceful, and similarly takes no
position on the ultimate sovereignty of the other disputed
features]{.underline}, their long-term disposition need not be the
litmus test of either U.S. or Chinese hegemony in the region. Of course,
[China would prefer not to have forward-deployed U.S. military forces in
the Western Pacific]{.underline} that could be used against it, **[but
Beijing has long tolerated and arguably could indefinitely tolerate an
American military presence in the region]{.underline}**---unless that
presence is clearly and exclusively aimed at coercing or containing
China. It is also true that Beijing disagrees with American principles
of military freedom of navigation in the region; and this constitutes a
significant challenge in waters where China claims territorial
jurisdiction in violation of the UN Commission on the Law of the Sea.
But [**this should not be conflated with a Chinese desire or intention
to exclusively "control" all the waters within the first island chain in
the Western Pacific.** The Chinese almost certainly recognize that
exclusive control or "domination" of the neighborhood is not achievable
at any reasonable cost, and that pursuing it would be counterproductive
by inviting pushback and challenges that would negate the
objective.]{.underline} So what would Chinese "hegemony" in East Asia
mean or look like? [Beijing probably thinks in terms]{.underline} of
something much like American primacy in the Western Hemisphere: a model
in which [China is generally recognized and acknowledged as the de facto
central or primary power in the region, but has little need or incentive
for militarily adventurism because the mutual benefits of economic
interdependence prevail and the neighbors have no
reason]{.underline}---and inherent disincentives---[to challenge China's
vital interests or security]{.underline}. And as a parallel to China's
economic and diplomatic engagement in Latin America, **[Beijing would
neither exclude nor be hostile to continued U.S. engagement in East
Asia.]{.underline}** A standard counterargument to this relatively
benign scenario is [that Beijing would not be content with it for
long]{.underline} because China's strategic ambitions will expand as its
capabilities grow. This is a valid hypothesis, but it usually
o**[verlooks the greater possibility that China's external ambitions
will expand not because its inherent capabilities have
grown]{.underline}**, but because [Beijing sees the need to be more
assertive in response to external challenges to Chinese interests or
security]{.underline}. Indeed, much of [China's
"assertiveness"]{.underline} within East Asia over the past
decade---when Beijing probably would prefer to focus on domestic
priorities---[has been a reaction to such perceived challenges.
Accordingly, Beijing's willingness to settle]{.underline} for a
narrowly-defined, peaceable version of regional preeminence will [depend
heavily on whether it perceives other countries---especially the United
States---as trying to deny China this option]{.underline} and instead
obstruct Chinese interests or security in the region. This leads to the
second inherent problem with the mantra that the United States must
maintain its primacy in the Western Pacific to prevent a hostile rival
hegemon: **[U.S. primacy in the region itself is not sustainable, and
trying to sustain it will probably be counterproductive.]{.underline}**
For all intents and purposes, American primacy in East Asia---depending
on how it is defined---is arguably already a thing of the past. Since
about a decade ago, [China has a larger share of East Asian regional
trade than the United States]{.underline}, and is now the biggest
trading partner of most of its neighbors. If defined in military terms,
**[most net assessments suggest that the American advantage in power
projection forces within the region is eroding relative to Chinese
capabilities]{.underline}**; and [it is not at all clear in the wake of
sequestration and competing budgetary priorities that the United States
could or will devote the resources necessary]{.underline} to arrest this
trend. American primacy in East Asia has often been characterized in
terms of the United States serving as the guarantor of regional
security, protecting the "global commons" and providing "public goods"
there. The U.S. alliance network in the region certainly extends an
umbrella of protection to those countries with which Washington has
defense pacts; and its military freedom of navigation operations signal
an intention to resist excessive Chinese maritime claims. But [even U.S.
allies do not perceive that China is being deterred in the South and
East China Seas.]{.underline} More broadly[, it is not clear what other
public goods the United States is actually providing in the East Asian
comm]{.underline}ons. For example, **[commercial shippers in the Western
Pacific do not presume or rely on the protection of the U.S.
Navy]{.underline}**---which doesn't have the fleet to provide it. And
**[Washington's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership has
undermined the idea of U.S. leadership in the region on behalf of shared
economic interests.]{.underline}** Indeed, [most East Asian
countries---including U.S. allies---appear increasingly uncertain about
Washington's attention to their interests and their
security]{.underline}. Questions and even doubts about the substance and
sustainability of the American commitment to the region have grown over
the past decade, and [most of the countries in the region---again,
including U.S. allies---have already been adjusting their foreign and
security policies to hedge against the potential unreliability of the
United States]{.underline}. Indeed, such hedging and
independent-mindedness by U.S. allies is itself contributing to the
erosion of U.S. influence in the region. On balance, it is hard to make
the case that the United States retains effective primacy in the Western
Pacific when much of the region has doubts about Washington's ability
and willingness to exercise it.

Tensions with Iran might be rising, but [American forces are already are
at war in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. is backing Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates in their bloody conflict against
Yemen]{.underline}, and the Trump administration is acting as PR agent
and bodyguard for the two royal families. The conflict violates American
values and hurts U.S. interests. **[Tens of thousands of Yemeni
civilians have been killed with Washington's assistance. U.S. support
for this murderous war of aggression may also be creating new terrorists
who could target America in the future.]{.underline}** Modern Yemen was
born in conflict some six decades ago. The territory included an
independent kingdom and British colony. For a time, Egyptian and Saudi
troops backed warring Yemeni regimes. The two Yemens became one in 1990
and Ali Abdullah Saleh was elected president. Yet Saudi Arabia continued
to meddle, promoting intolerant Wahhabism, which further upset Yemen's
internal balance. In 2004, Ansar Allah or Partisans of God, popularly
known as the Houthis, rose against Saleh. The Houthis are dominated by
Zaydi Shia (which differ theologically from Iranian Shia). When the Arab
Spring washed over Yemen in 2011, Saleh was ousted. He then made common
cause with his former enemies, the Houthis, and together they kicked out
his successor, President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, four years later. None
of this had anything to do with Iran, which area specialists affirm
exercised little influence over any Yemeni faction. [And the Houthis had
no designs against Saudi Arabia or America. They were focused on
consolidating power against their domestic enemies.]{.underline}
However, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened militarily
in 2015 in hopes of returning Hadi to his presidential quarters in
Sanaa. The war was expected to be a cakewalk, lasting just a few weeks.
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi squeezed contributions from Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait,
Morocco, and Sudan---that regime's notorious Janjaweed militia---as well
as Qatar, before they turned against the latter. The "coalition" also
enlisted Yemeni factions, including al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
[The Obama administration, hoping to reassure Riyadh after negotiating
its nuclear agreement with Iran, provided Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates with munitions, targeting assistance, and airborne
refueling. The Trump administration continued this support, recently
announcing "emergency" approval of more weapons sales to sidestep the
requirement for congressional authorization. Nevertheless, the war rages
on inconclusively. Despite its many advantages, the coalition, and
especially Saudi Arabia, is suffering blowbac]{.underline}k. Last week,
a Yemeni missile hit Abha airport in the Saudi south, causing 26
casualties. The Kingdom responded with hypocritical shrieks of rage and
threats of revenge. Deputy Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman,
his hands drenched in the blood of dead Yemeni civilians, denounced
Iran's "[reckless escalation, through the use of ballistic missiles and
UAVs to directly target civilian installations and innocent
civilians]{.underline}." A Saudi spokesman criticized ["the continuation
of the Iranian regime's support and practice of cross-border
terrorism."]{.underline} Yemeni insurgents responded with the language
of the Koran: "[Whoever has assaulted you, assault him in the same way
that he has assaulted you]{.underline}," said spokesman Mohammed Abdel
Salam. He explained that airport attacks were intended to force the
coalition to lift its starvation blockade on Yemen. [And it was the
invaders who had acted as the true "terrorists." Lacking a U.S.-supplied
air force, the Yeminis make do with whatever weapons they can
find]{.underline}. Houthi insurgents have fired more than 185 missiles
through last September, and have increasingly utilized drones against
their better armed enemies. The conflict highlights the Saudis' and
Emiratis' pitiful state. Crown princes Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi
Arabia and Mohammed bin Zayed of the UAE are ostentatious "losers," in
Donald Trump's parlance, as well as callous killers. **[The U.S. never
had any good reason to join this fight. Yemen has no intrinsic value to
America. The Houthis have no reason to attack the U.S., Gulf shipping,
or Saudi Arabia, except as retaliation]{.underline}**. The most direct
threat to American forces, an apparent missile launch in late 2016
targeting a U.S. vessel in the Gulf of Aden, reflected Washington's
active belligerency against Yemen. Beyond that is self-parody:
[Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued that Washington had to back
Riyadh's aggression to protect Americans traveling through Saudi
airports, who were in danger only because of Saudi Arabia's continuing
assault on Yemen.]{.underline} Nor is Iran an issue. The Houthis have
never been the Islamic Republic's proxies. Indeed, the group seized the
Yemeni capital of Sanaa against Tehran's advice. Only dire necessity
forced the Yemenis to turn to Iran for aid, and the latter has taken
advantage of its Gulf adversaries' misadventure to bleed them.
[America's support for the royals' botched attempt at conquest plays to
Iran's strength.]{.underline} AQAP has long been viewed as the most
threatening al-Qaeda affiliate. The Houthis have opposed the terrorist
group, while Hadi allied with it. The Saudis and Emiratis have variously
armed, aided, or tolerated a variety of radical Islamists. Last year,
according to the Associated Press, [the coalition paid and recruited
AQAP members and "cut secret deals with al-Qaida fighters, paying some
to leave key cities and towns and letting others retreat with weapons,
equipment and wads of looted cash."]{.underline} Moreover, Amnesty
International reports that **[Washington's nominal allies have been
"recklessly" supplying weapons to radical groups in
Yemen.]{.underline}** As a result, **["compromises and alliances have
allowed al-Qaeda militants to survive to fight another day---and risk
strengthening the most dangerous branch of the terror network that
carried out the 9/11 attacks."]{.underline}** CNN also investigated the
issue: "[Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners have transferred
American-made weapons to al-Qaeda-linked figures, hardline Salafi
militias, and other factions waging war in Yemen, in violation of their
agreements with the United States." The humanitarian cost of the war has
been extraordinarily high]{.underline}. The conflict so far has rolled
back national development by 21 years, figures the UN Development
Programme (UNDP). Complains Amnesty International's Lynn Maalouf,
**["all parties to the conflict in Yemen have acted with utter disregard
for civilian lives."]{.underline}** Last year, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights reported: "[Coalition air strikes have
caused most of the documented civilian casualties. In the past three
years, such air strikes have hit residential areas, markets, funerals,
weddings, detention facilities, civilian boats and even medical
facilities]{.underline}." By year's end, predicted the UNDP, there would
be about 102,000 battle deaths, with estimates of [the civilian toll
ranging between 60,000 and 133,000]{.underline}, mostly ["indirect"
civilian deaths due to the widespread destruction of social, economic,
and agricultural infrastructure.]{.underline} The UNDP figured that
every 12 minutes a Yemeni child dies. [About four million people have
been displaced since the start of the war.]{.underline} Roughly 80
percent of the population of nearly 30 million needs aid, [while 1.3
million have contracted cholera, two thirds of the population is "food
insecure" and about a third suffer serious hunger]{.underline}, and
civilian infrastructure, primitive to begin with, has been wrecked.
Almost two thirds of Yemenis lack clean water, adequate sanitation, and
necessary health care. In January, the United Nations Panel of Experts
on Yemen warned of the country's continuing "slide towards humanitarian
and economic catastrophe." **[Washington has become an accomplice to
murder at the behest of nations that routinely undermine its own
interests.]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia is a tyranny at home, with not a
scintilla of political or religious liberty, while the UAE looks good
only in comparison to its larger neighbor. [**The two states' shared
foreign policy has been brutal, reckless, and contrary to America's
interests.** Both are pushing Washington towards war with Iran,
fomenting conflict rather than diplomacy in Libya, and backing the
Sudanese military against protesters seeking democratic
rule.]{.underline} The two royal regimes have supported brutal
dictatorships in Bahrain and Egypt, subsidized radical jihadists in
Syria, and divided the Gulf by isolating Qatar. Riyadh also continues to
spread, even in America, fundamentalist Wahhabism, which acts as a
precursor to terrorism by demonizing all but Sunni Muslims. The Trump
administration should stop putting the interests of the Gulf monarchies
before those of the U.S. With a missile program and nuclear ambitions,
Saudi Arabia is a particularly dangerous regional player. Instead of
encouraging Riyadh's and Abu Dhabi's delusions of regional hegemony, the
U.S. should promote a Mideast balance of power by developing relations
with Iran. Most immediately, Washington should stop underwriting Saudi
and Emirati atrocities in Yemen. The war "is a preventable humanitarian
disaster," notes the UNDP. Moreover, the West should either embargo arms
for the coalition or lift the ban on weapons for Yemenis. Abu Dhabi and
Riyadh should be forced to bear the entire cost of their criminal war.
For that, a few more missile attacks on coalition targets might help.

Nevertheless**, [liberal internationalists]{.underline}** are
cosmopolitans---opposed to narrow nationalism and trade protectionism,
within a US-led international system. But its core ideas---rule of law,
superiority of the western idea (however lightly worn), a rules-based
institutional order open to all, in principle---**[are deeply embedded
in US political-intellectual elite think-tanks, university public policy
schools, corporate media and the leaderships of both main political
parties]{.underline}**,17 the core of the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant
establishment.18 Importantly, however, there are influential voices in
the emerging powers and regions that support the liberal international
order by calling for internal reform to take account of the changing
distribution of global power away from the West and towards the
'rest'.19 [The upshot is a broad consensus]{.underline} around certain
core ideas: [that the post-1945 rules-based world order]{.underline},
whatever its weaknesses, [serves the world well by spreading prosperity
and maintaining peace]{.underline}; and that, although it cannot
continue unreformed, the US-led system draws on deep
resources---economic, military, systemic and 'soft'---that bestow upon
it continuing strengths to contain, engage, manage and socialize
emerging powers. Charles Kupchan lists a range of problems requiring US
leadership, even if only within a suitably reformed international system
reflecting 'the real distribution of power'.20 John
[Ikenberry]{.underline} of Princeton University, the leading proponent
of this school of thought, makes significant claims as well as several
unquestioned assumptions, undeveloped allusions to core powers' violent
and other connections with the periphery, and a number of significant
silences. He [claims]{.underline}, for example, [that the United States
is a fully functioning democracy, yet fails to acknowledge evidence of
the power of racialized, class-based elites]{.underline}. For critical
theorists, such as Robert Cox, Stephen Gill and Craig Murphy,21 the
[international relations of elites across states and societies operate
to reproduce extant patterns of power and manage or engineer change to
the benefit of elites]{.underline} [in a generally zero-sum game in
which broad masses and lower classes lose out.]{.underline} [This is
clearly a far cry from liberal internationalist claims associated with
the benefits of globalization]{.underline}, notwithstanding 16 John

Likewise, claims about the centrality of the rule of law occlude
consideration of significant violations in practice. [The question of
imperial power is hardly addressed]{.underline}, and [there is a general
Eurocentric neglect of the significance of global areas beyond the core
to the 'welfare' and cohesion of the core itself. **There is a clear
link between Ikenberry's overt theory of American democracy and its
liberal-hegemonic world role**]{.underline}. The United States, and the
western order it built, is characterized as a pluralistic liberal market
democracy that is broadly inclusive and tolerant of ethnic diversity.
The US-built security community exhibits its leading state's internal
character as a plural one and, very significantly, one in which the
United States is bound by rules.22 Yet liberal internationalists'
underlying assumptions effectively deny the findings of numerous
well-researched studies challenging American democracy's principal
claims.23 As far as Ikenberry and Deudney (and many others) are
concerned, the 'western idea' is a significant part of the strength of
the US-led order.24 [The West,]{.underline} a spectacularly successful
'civilizational heritage', [was]{.underline} underpinned by America's
New Deal liberalism, and [extended globally via Bretton Woods, the
Marshall Plan and NATO.]{.underline} In effect, [this
vision]{.underline} and programme [aimed to defuse domestic class
conflict and the threat of war]{.underline} through 'activist
government, political democracy, and international alliance'. That
system is in principle capable of assimilating emerging powers, given
the universalism of its values and its tolerance of ethnic differences,
although **[others joining this privileged grouping are expected to
conform to its rules and accept US leadership.]{.underline}** [Western
order is exclusive also because special rules apply within its zone of
peace.]{.underline} Beyond it, conversely, [other rules apply---cruder,
neo-imperial and violent,]{.underline} although the implications of this
contrast are left unaddressed.25 By drawing a line around the West,
**[Ikenberry cuts off the rest of the world while addressing questions
about the sources of world order which, empirically, lie in a symbiotic
relationship between core and periphery.]{.underline}** Yet, even within
the 'greater' West, Japan and South Korea were not accorded the same
treatment as western Europe.26 The LIO really was conceived and
developed as a system of the West and the rest, in a zero-sum game. As

Parmar 158 International Affairs 94: 1, 2018 Yet [the claim persists
that this is no empire, despite America's privileged place at the top of
the 'hierarchical political order', because its hegemony is built on
'consent' and bounded by law]{.underline}. [Power]{.underline}, which
was necessary at the creation, [faded away as consensual hegemony
developed. This interpretation, of course, elides America's overwhelming
military superiority]{.underline}, including in and over Europe. Beyond
Europe, however, **[Ikenberry concedes that American hegemony remained
hierarchical, 'with much fainter liberal
characteristics']{.underline}**,28 [again closing off an avenue of
analytical and empirical analysis that might threaten the intellectual
edifice of the LIO. **The**]{.underline} (unconsciously) **[racialized
world-view of Ikenberry's Eurocentrism]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
subtly [buttressed by Walter Russell Mead's exploration of the
significance of superior Anglo-Saxons who win wars, build world
structures, and govern efficiently owing to ethno-cultural, not
biological, characteristics]{.underline}.29 [Mead's interpretation of
Anglo-Saxonism makes it appear benign, assimilative and universal--- a
scaffolding to support Ikenberry's more overtly institutional
analysis.]{.underline} Assimilating minorities, however, is not
embracing diversity---learning from other cultures and creating
something new; it is maintaining conformity to the cultures of the
powerful, dominant group.30 Looking to the future, as new global powers
emerge, Mead advises America to both embrace and contain them, retaining
military superiority should 'rising' powers become 'opponents'.31 Mead
complements the prescriptions of [other liberal-realist
internationalists]{.underline}, all [seek]{.underline}ing [to
incorporate, assimilate and mobilize emerging powers to absorb
difference and produce conformity.]{.underline} The liberal view is
challenged by scholars who argue that the New Deal order effectively
represented a political compromise, made in order to attain class peace
and greater productivity, that mainly benefited major corporations while
incorporating organized labour and thereby drawing its teeth. The
postwar settlement was a narrow one---excluding racial minorities,
unskilled and unorganized labour, and women---and relied on war and a
heavily militarized economy that arose with the war in Korea and led
directly to that in Vietnam.32 [Liberal internationalists' accounts
elide the class, gendered and racial bases of the order, both at home
and abroad]{.underline}. [Ikenberry paints an appealing picture of a
liberal order that delivered material benefits and security to all,
while also raising some doubts about the operation of the system,
especially with regard to the inequality of rewards generated by
globalization and its potential political consequences]{.underline}.
Those consequences are regarded by Ikenberry as posing the greatest
threats to the stability of the liberal order, laying bare a central
mechanism and dynamic of the system itself: market-driven class
inequality, exacerbated in a society in which racialized class politics
is salient.33 Yet Ikenberry never mentions class, 28 Ikenberry, Liberal

gender---an omission central to critical theories of the making of the
LIO.34 **[The other key omission is the role played in building the
order by violence and outright war]{.underline}**---not just [the Second
World War]{.underline} but also [the Korean War]{.underline}, the 'hot'
war at the birth of the order that propelled the formation of NATO, [the
rearmament of Germany, the security alliance with Japan and indeed the
US military-- industrial complex.]{.underline}35 Accordingly, a key
focus of consideration here is wartime planning for a new world order
and the manner of its foundation as a direct result of military violence
that violated the UN Charter, international law, the lessons of the
Nuremberg and Tokyo war crimes trials, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
Wars 'out there' secured the core 'over here'.36 And, of course, what is
referred to as **[benign 'liberal internationalism' is]{.underline}**
what Mark Mazower refers to as **['imperial
internationalism']{.underline}**---**[trying to maintain a global
hierarchy established by centuries of colonial and semi-colonial rule
over what is now called the global South]{.underline}**.37 Finally, the
construction of the postwar western order was constitutive of a
political, social, economic and ideological 'vital center', as
Schlesinger terms it38---opposed to both right-wing nationalists and
left-wing anti-imperialists. This entailed the acceptance by core forces
of the 'New Deal order' that **[the price of class harmony, stability
and mobility at home was the export and continuation of
inequality]{.underline}**,39 **[and therefore military violence, on the
periphery]{.underline}**; and that the [removal of vast quantities of
raw materials required a global military basing strategy, both to
protect allied trade and to deny it to adversaries.]{.underline}40
[Ikenberry]{.underline} accurately notes that the internal character of
the leading state in the liberal order has an impact on the
international system it built; but I diverge from his presentation of
this impact as the externalization of a democratic regime. He [elides
the racial, class and gendered character of American historical,
economic and political development]{.underline}---including that of
Wilsonianism itself.41 His conclusion, however, is accurate, even if he
fails to recognize its significance in the building and maintenance of
the liberal order: 'Access to resources and markets, socioeconomic
stability, political pluralism, and American security interests---all
were inextricably linked.'42 The framework that may best fit the actual
underlying engine of liberal orderbuilding and maintenance, however,
must also incorporate understanding of the 'soft' processes of
socialization or incorporation. Violence is a powerful tool, but 34

non-violent elite socialization and alliance-building. It is one of the
great strengths of Ikenberry's analysis of international order that
elite socialization is considered so significant.43 Yet [a critical view
of elite socialization in the building and perpetuation of hegemony
views it not as a reflection of a democratic and benign foreign policy,
but as incorporation into hegemonic agendas]{.underline} or
'domestication'.44 In the Gramscian perspective, **[capitalist Great
Powers]{.underline}**, including the United States, **[are deeply
unequal at home and imperialistic abroad, ultimately pursuing the
interests of their ruling classes and elites, whether embedded in
private, public or state-- private realms]{.underline}**.45 Their
hegemony is a combination of persuasion and coercion involving a
'state--society complex'.46 Admittedly, liberalism gives an account of
elite socialization processes that overlaps with Gramscian approaches.
However, liberal approaches see it as relatively benign, politically
neutral or representative of democracy/popular sovereignty.

### Impact -- Middle East

#### American pursuit of hegemony in the Middle East makes conflict certain -- it has spurred nuclear proliferation, provoked Russia, heightened religious tensions, and catalyzed terrorism

**Chengde 18** \[Yin Chengde, Research Fellow, China Foundation for
International Studies, "The US' Pursuit of Hegemony Has Harmed the
Middle East," 10/9/18,
<https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/the-us-pursuit-of-hegemony-has-harmed-the-middle-east>\]
sg

[At this year's]{.underline} United Nations [General
Assembly]{.underline}, US President Donald [Trump launched an
unprecedentedly strong attack on Iran, pledging to impose
more]{.underline}, and harsher, [sanctions]{.underline} on it, and
threatened to punish countries and companies doing business with it.
[This]{.underline} is [reflects]{.underline} the US' ultra-strong
anti-Iran policy, as well as [a plan to extend US hegemony in the Middle
East.]{.underline} In the post-Cold War era, [the US has adopted a
Middle East strategy aiming at exclusive US domination]{.underline},
[helping Israel grow stronger]{.underline}, orchestrating regime change
in various countries, [and promoting all-round
Westernization]{.underline}. [It doesn't even hesitate to topple
governments of sovereign countries by force]{.underline}. During Barack
Obama's second term as US president, in order to shift its strategic
focus eastward to the Asia-Pacific, the US' Middle East strategy
contracted somewhat, and policies tended to be pragmatic. For instance,
it withdrew partially from Iraq, ending the Iraq war that had lasted
nearly a decade; loosened relations with Iran, signing the Iran nuclear
deal; and kept a certain distance from the ultra-rightist Israeli
government. Such moves eased tensions in the turbulent Middle East.
Conditions have changed abruptly since **[Trump]{.underline}** assumed
the presidency. He [reversed Obama's approaches, and **redoubled
endeavors to promote US hegemony**]{.underline}. [He withdrew from the
Iran nuclear deal, and]{.underline} restored and [enhanced comprehensive
sanctions]{.underline}. [He]{.underline} supported Israel and
[suppressed Palestine, recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and
moving the US embassy there, cancelling]{.underline} [various aid
programs for Palestine]{.underline}, including humanitarian assistance
to Palestinian refugees, closing the PLO office in Washington, proposing
an "ultimate solution" to the Israel-Palestine conflict that is
completely in favor of the former. [He carried out multiple rounds of
indiscriminate bombing in Syria]{.underline}, increased US troops
stationed there to more than 2,000, and opened a de facto exclusive US
"enclave" there. More importantly, [the Trump administration is
racing]{.underline} against time [to organize an anti-Iran alliance
amongst mostly Arab Sunni countries in the Gulf area against Shiite
nations like Iran and Syria]{.underline}, [in order to more
forcefully]{.underline} and effectively strike and [bring down the
Iranian and Syrian governments, check Russia influence, and, consolidate
its position in the Middle East]{.underline}. No other US administration
in the past three decades has pursued such a tough strategy of hegemony
in the region. **[The Trump administration has seriously
disturbed]{.underline}** and worsened **[regional conditions, sinking it
in tensions, turmoil, even wars not seen for many years]{.underline}**.
[First]{.underline}, [it discontinued the Israel-Palestine peace
process, and re-started their conflict]{.underline}. The problem with
Trump's Middle East policy is not just being partial to Israel, but
bullying Palestine, disqualifying itself as a mediator, [with
Palestine]{.underline} [angrily rejecting the US']{.underline} mediating
role, [and suing it for violations of international law]{.underline}.
[Second,]{.underline} it instigated and worsened confrontations between
two groups in the region. [By persuading Saudi Arabia-led Arab Sunni
countries to intervene in the Syria war and act against Iran**, the US
will inevitably worsen relations between Saudi-led Sunni nations and
Iran-led Shiite ones**]{.underline}. [The US strategy]{.underline} of
fighting Arabs with Arabs and fighting Muslims with Muslims [has turned
the two religious denominations' into a major source of
conflicts]{.underline}. **[Third, it seriously undermined the nuclear
non-proliferation regime and global security]{.underline}**. [The Iran
nuclear deal was achieved through difficult]{.underline}, protracted
[negotiations]{.underline} by six parties. The Trump administration's
withdrawal and re-imposition of sanctions has created uncertainty for
the future of the agreement. If [Iran]{.underline} can't receive the
practical benefits it deserves for forsaking nuclear weapons, it
[may]{.underline} withdraw from the agreement and [restart its nuclear
program]{.underline}. **[The US move may open the "Pandora's box" of
nuclear proliferation in the Middle East]{.underline}**. [Fourth, it
amplified risks of conflict]{.underline} between major countries. **[The
Middle East is the focus of US-Russia geo-political
competition]{.underline}**. [The US sees Iran and Syria as]{.underline}
the only [hostile]{.underline} [and alien]{.underline} countries
threatening US interests in the Middle East. [The main goal of its
regional policy is to suppress them and prompt regime
change]{.underline} in the two countries. [Russia, on the other hand, is
offering strong support for both]{.underline}, preventing the US from
fulfilling that goal. Syria is Russia's sole strategic foothold in the
Middle East, which it will do everything to preserve. With the civil war
in Syria reaching its last juncture, the Russia-led Syria-Iran camp will
try hard to liberate the country's entire territory, and the US-led
anti-Syria camp will not back down. **[The US' illegal direct military
intervention in Syria will very likely lead to military conflict with
Russia]{.underline}**. The Middle East, as a major oil-producing area.
Therefore, maintaining exclusive hegemony in the Middle East is crucial
for US global hegemony, which is also a main foreign policy goal of all
US administrations after the Cold War. The Trump administration's
ultra-strong Middle East policy certainly proceeds from US hegemony, but
it also involves other considerations. Jewish corporate interests wield
significant influence on American politics, economy, and media, Trump
believes the stronger, more pro-Israel, and tougher he appears against
Russia in the Middle East, the stronger America will look, and the more
easily he will win the hearts of American populists and Jews. This will
him get rid of the "Russia interference" issue, help the Republican
Party win in the mid-term elections, and help him win a second term.
[Trump assumes his extremely tough Middle East policy is the best way to
demonstrate his commitment to "America First", and is in the US'
interests, but he is actually wrong]{.underline}. [His irrational
actions have done severe harm to the interests of]{.underline} [all
stakeholders]{.underline}, and the US has ended up being the foremost
victim. Since **[US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has invited
unanimous opposition from the international community]{.underline}**,
especially the other five signatory countries, the US threat to punish
any country that does business with Iran and suffocate the Iranian
economy will not succeed. On the contrary, **[the US' image and
credibility have suffered a great blow]{.underline}**. The US finds
itself in such unprecedented isolation that **[some international media
have branded it an "international Pariah]{.underline}**". **[The US
withdrawal]{.underline}** from the deal **[may also worsen nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}**, posing a challenge to its own security. By
suppressing Palestine and supporting Israel, the US has led to the
[**discontinuation of the peace process**, prolonged]{.underline} and
acerbated the [suffering of the Palestinians, which **will inevitably
sow seeds of hostility against the US** in Palestinians and Arab
Muslims]{.underline}, and **[international terrorism against the US may
stage a comeback.]{.underline}** Trump's reckless moves, which he
believes are smart, may end up hurting the US itself. It is thus hoped
that the US government will learn from its past failures and wake up
from its obsession with hegemony.

### Impact -- Rising Powers

#### US hegemony emboldens rising powers like Russia and China to pursue extra terrestrial militarization

[Russia and China have both expressed interest in building a base on the
moon, and Moscow\'s space chief said the two may pool their resources to
make the ambitious project a reality.]{.underline} Dmitry Rogozin,
director general of Russia\'s Roscosmos State Space Corp. and the former
deputy defense minister, said that the [Russian and Chinese space
programs were considering working jointly to establish a lunar
station.]{.underline} As Russia prepares to meet its 2021 deadline for
the country\'s first unmanned lunar mission, a [growing relationship
with China has presented new opportunities as Moscow\'s ties to the U.S.
continue to worsen.]{.underline} \"[China is a serious
partner]{.underline}. I don\'t rule out that as soon as we agree on the
outlines of our lunar program with the Americans, it is our manned lunar
program. The formation of a research station on the moon\'s surface is
likely to be carried out with our Chinese partners. They can be equal
partners already in the coming years,\" Rogozin told Channel One Russia,
according to the state-run Tass news agency. \"[We plan to land on the
moon. A drill will be activated to collect lunar soil samples that will
be taken to Earth]{.underline},\" he added. Journalists watch a mock
walk on Mars of volunteers of the Mars500 experiment, taikonaut Van Yue
of China and cosmonaut Alexander Smoleyevsky of Russia, at the Korolev
Space Mission Control Center outside Moscow on February 18, 2011. [The
two countries h ave stepped up bilateral cooperation in recent years,
including in scientific fields. Much of the world\'s initial
extraterrestrial achievements came as a result of the so-called space
race between two superpowers competing as part of the larger Cold
War.]{.underline} While the Soviet Union pioneered early space
exploration with achievements such as the first satellite, the first
images of the dark side of the moon and the first human spaceflight,
[the U.S. remains the only country to have conducted a manned lunar
mission, of which it has carried out several]{.underline}, the last
being in 1972. [As the international bout between Moscow and Washington
played out, Beijing sought to catch up with the leading
powers.]{.underline} But it was not until 2013 that [China followed
Russia and the U.S.]{.underline} to become the third country to
successfully conduct a \"soft landing\" on the moon. China has since
announced a mission to send a probe to the dark side of the moon and
create a new space station. China maintained its own, mostly unmanned
space station, Tiangong-1, which was launched in 2011 before later
expiring and falling to Earth in a dramatic turn of events this past
April. The only space station currently in orbit is the International
Space Station, which is largely operated by the U.S. and Russia. [With
Washington and Moscow reigniting geopolitical tensions reminiscent of
the Cold War, however, their feud appears to have also exceeded
planetary boundaries]{.underline}. Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov
has suggested his country may opt not to renew its contract with NASA to
transport U.S. astronauts to the station. Earlier this month, Rogozin
said [a hole that appeared in the station\'s side may have the result of
\"deliberate interference in space,\" suggesting sabotage]{.underline}.
Both NASA and Roscosmos have since said they would forgo \"preliminary
conclusions and providing any explanations\" until a full investigation
was conducted. [The U.S. has accused Russia and China of militarizing
space through anti-satellite development and other
weaponry]{.underline}, prompting President Donald Trump to announce in
June that he was establishing a space force as the sixth branch of the
military. **[Russia and China have condemned the move, accusing the U.S.
of being stuck in a Cold War mindset and unnecessarily risking a
conflict in space. Countering what they perceive as U.S. hegemony across
the world and beyond, Russia and China have boosted bilateral
cooperation in defense, politics, economics and other fields, including
science]{.underline}**. In July, Rogozin first announced that the two
countries were considering working together to explore the moon and
potentially travel deeper into space as well.

A very crowded space [The US Government]{.underline} and American firms
[continue to play a dominant role in]{.underline} more traditional
[space technology development]{.underline} and deployment.
[SpaceX]{.underline}, for example, [is a major private supplier of
rockets]{.underline}, [while the US Air Force]{.underline} currently
[coordinates international satellite traffic]{.underline}, providing
advanced warnings about potentially dangerous space debris. Listen to
the episode Are we moving away from the notion that space is for all
humankind? And **[is conflict in space inevitable]{.underline}**? But
[the number of players is rapidly increasing]{.underline}. The OECD\'s
Space Forum says [more than 80 countries now have some form of space
program]{.underline}, mostly concentrated on rockets, satellites and
satellite-related services and technology. They estimate the global
industry is worth somewhere around \$US400 billion and growing quickly.
And [that figure could skyrocket if]{.underline}, and when, [asteroid
mining kicks off.]{.underline} Eric Stallmer, the president of the
US-based Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a consortium of 85
space-related organisations and businesses, believes that moment is fast
approaching. \"I think we are looking at a five to 10-year timetable for
developing that technology. It makes for an exciting time,\" he said.
The new frontier **[Despite the growing international competition, US
officials continue to refer to space in hegemonic terms.]{.underline}**
Earlier this month US Vice-President [Mike Pence spoke of outer space as
the \"next great American frontier\", while]{.underline} Defence

national interests\".]{.underline} He then went on to warn that **[it

have got to adapt to that reality,\" he said. \"**[It\'s on par with the
air, land, sea and cyberspace domains in terms of it being

arm of the military --- is set to be established by 2020. Sorry, this

to be a Space Command and a Space Development Agency, tasked with the
creation of future space technologies. America\'s main space-related
military activity --- such as the deployment of defence satellites ---
is currently undertaken by the US Air Force on behalf of other branches
of the military. Much of that role is likely to be given over to this
new entity, but exactly how the Space Force will operate, and the broad
nature of its brief, still remains a mystery. The Pentagon has been
tasked with finalising the details, which will then be put before
Congress for final approval. Only last year, the Congress rejected the
need for such a service. \"I think people have very different ideas
about what this Space Force might look like,\" Professor de Zwart said.
\"Is it intended to do capacity building, to train up astronauts, for
example, or are you talking about something more science fiction
oriented, like placing forces in space? \"I think what people are
worried about is the sense that **[the establishment of a Space

**[if non-democratic rivals secretly begin developing their own space
weapons programmes in response.]{.underline}** \"A Western country like

was criticised by the international community for testing an
anti-satellite missile system against one of its own surplus weather
satellites. The test resulted in the destruction of the satellite and
the creation of thousands of pieces of space debris. Beijing claimed the
incident was not intended to be threatening, but it\'s possible the test
may have influenced American military thinking as a result. In February
this year the office of the US Director of National Intelligence named
both China and Russia as potential military rivals in space. The 2018
Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community report
stated: \"We assess that, if a future conflict were to occur involving
Russia or China, either country would justify attacks against US and
allied satellites as necessary to offset any perceived US military
advantage derived from military, civil or commercial space systems.\" An
end to multilateralism Associate Professor Oduntan believes the US and
other countries may be violating international law by developing weapons
for space, and by encouraging the possibility of commercial asteroid
mining. He says [both the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and the Moon
Agreement of 1979 were designed to prevent the \"unilateral and
unbridled commercial exploitation of outer-space
resources\".]{.underline} But, he acknowledges that while [the United
States]{.underline} is a signatory to the 1967 Treaty, it [has never
ratified the Moon Agreement]{.underline}. Will people return to the
Moon? It\'s inevitable that mankind will return to the Moon, but the
arguments for going there have changed dramatically since the Apollo
missions, experts say. For more than a decade now, the UN-aligned
Conference on Disarmament has been discussing a possible update or
accompaniment to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, a new multilateral
agreement. As part of those ongoing negotiations, both the Russians and
the Chinese have proposed an agreement called the PPWT, essentially a
treaty that would ban the placement of military weapons in outer space.
The treaty negotiations have repeatedly been criticised by the US. Dr
Oduntan believes such an agreement could be effective if the United
States was persuaded to come onboard. \"They have announced that they
are not part of it, they are being cool towards it,\" he said. \"And
therefore we have the bizarre situation where it is China and Russia
that are making joint proposals and joint presentations as to what this
treaty should contain. \"A lot of states, from Sri Lanka to Nigeria to
the Netherlands, they\'ve all made contributions, working papers, ideas
on what this treaty should contain, and even United Kingdom. However,
the US Senate is extremely careful on what it ratifies, and that\'s not
very good for the progress of international law.\" YOUTUBE: The Moon
offers resource deposits and China recently launched the Magpie Bridge
satellite to help with exploration. Professor de Zwart says [the Outer
Space Treaty served a specific purpose during the Cold War in preventing
an escalation of military activity on both sides of the Iron
Curtain.]{.underline} \"The two superpowers of the day were capable and
had sent people and objects into space,\" she said. \"So, it was a
recognition of the fact that they knew that if you placed a weapon of
mass destruction in space, it could cause harm to the entire Earth. It
was an enormously valuable treaty.\" However, **[she now believes the
days of multilateral space treaties are over.]{.underline}** \"It
doesn\'t have any teeth now. What you have now is a greater number of
space-faring nations and, of course, you have that very unanticipated
explosion of commercial uses of space,\" she said. Instead, [she\'s part
of an international project called the Woomera Manual]{.underline}, that
has seen dozens of experts come together to draft a \"definitive
document\" on security law as it applies to space. The hope is
[that]{.underline} the manual [might make it easier to persuade nation
states to comply with existing international agreements.]{.underline}
Listen to the podcast Listen to the podcast Future Tense explores new
ideas and new technologies. However, Professor de Zwart concedes that
getting all players to act responsibly could prove impossible. \"**[You
may have rogue nations who would be prepared to allow launches from
their states]{.underline}**, for example. **[Launches that don\'t comply
with any environmental law regulations]{.underline}**,\" she said. \"But

#### Enforcing American primacy through space exploration ensures US-China space war -- only multipolarity can mitigate tensions

[On January 2, 2019, China successfully landed the Chang'e 4 space probe
on the dark side of the moon -- making China the first country in
history to do so]{.underline}. This accomplishment represents just one
of China's most recent steps toward fulfilling its goal of becoming "a
space power in all respects." In pursuit of this goal, [China has become
the world's second largest spender on space capabilities.]{.underline}
Driven by the dual motives of seeking status and security, [China's
comprehensive modernization of its space program poses a challenge to
U.S. security interests]{.underline} and global standing. [However, by
recognizing Chinese status aspirations, the United States maintains an
important tool by which to temper competitive tensions]{.underline}, and
mitigate the threat of a full blown space race. [Much of China's space
program is oriented toward enhancing China's military
power]{.underline}. By developing heavier launch capabilities, China can
deliver intercontinental-range ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and place
heavy spy satellites in orbit. Similarly, China's pursuit of satellite
technologies contributes to China's efforts of "winning informationized
local wars." Likewise, through China's BeiDou navigation satellite
system (the Chinese equivalent of GPS), Chinese missiles can increase
their accuracy and lethality. Moreover, [Chinese counterspace
capabilities provide China important asymmetric advantages vis-à-vis the
United States]{.underline}, facilitating China's anti-access/area-denial
strategy [should a conflict break out between the two powers in the
Taiwan Strait]{.underline} [or in the]{.underline} East and [South China
Seas. Interacting with Chinese security concerns, however, is China's
increasing desire to enhance its great power status.]{.underline}
Chinese nationalist narratives blame China's "Century of Humiliation,"
in part, on the Qing Dynasty's reluctance to adopt modern technology
utilized by Western intruders. As such, [technological achievements are
viewed as]{.underline} important symbols of national power and as [an
effective currency for China to enhance its position at the great power
table]{.underline}. To signal its aspirations for great power status,
China invests considerable resources in expensive status projects. From
the launch of the Dong Fang Hong-1 satellite in 1970, to more modern
ventures -- such as manned spaceflight, the construction of a space
station in low earth orbit, or lunar exploration -- Chinese leaders have
invested heavily on projecting great power status both at home and
abroad. [By pursuing]{.underline} these [expensive and technologically
difficult projects, China can demonstrate that it belongs to an
exclusive group of great powers.]{.underline} Enjoying this article?

[combined status and security seeking motives have important
implications for U.S.-China relations]{.underline}. [Rising
powers]{.underline} such as China [are often driven to "seek a place in
the sun."]{.underline} However, **[such efforts]{.underline}** are often
costly and **[can catalyze arms races by raising threat perceptions
abroad]{.underline}** **[and breeding suspicions of hegemonic
intent.]{.underline}** Symbols of national power are often capabilities
that also have military applications. An illustrative case of this
phenomenon is that of Wilhelmine Germany. Some scholars, for example,
argue that despite facing greater land-based security threats, Germany's
status ambitions led it to invest in battleships (a status symbol at the
turn of the 20th century) -- which raised threat perceptions in Great
Britain and ultimately reduced German security. Overall, this
combination of status and security seeking motives is likely to prove
particularly destabilizing in the domain of space. [Owing to the dual
use nature of space technologies]{.underline}, [almost any advance made
by China in space can be portrayed as a potential threat to U.S.
national security]{.underline}. [This is especially true considering the
opacity of the Chinese space program]{.underline} and its close ties to
the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Even ostensibly peaceful activities
such as China's manned spaceflight program can, and have, been depicted
as security threats. Moreover, China's technological achievements in
areas unrelated to security -- e.g. landing on the dark side of the moon
-- are likely to be read as a bellwether for China's overall
capabilities vis-à-vis the United States, contributing to U.S. fears of
decline. As China's space power continues to increase, some analysts
contend that [the militarization of space is all but
inevitable]{.underline}. **[To respond to these challenges, the Trump
administration is calling]{.underline}** **[for]{.underline}** the
United States to establish **[an entirely new branch of the military, to
be known as the Space Force.]{.underline}** In isolation**[, such moves
are only likely to exacerbate tensions between Washington and Beijing
and may give rise to an arms race in space.]{.underline}** As China's
economy continues to grow, Beijing will increasingly have the capacity
to finance a space race. Considering the reliance of modern militaries
and economies on space-based assets, **[a militarized space race between
the United States and China would be disastrous.]{.underline}** I**[n
preventing a militarized space race, the United States needs to be
attentive to]{.underline}** the role of **[China's aspirations for great
power status.]{.underline}** [Chinese status ambitions provide U.S.
policymakers an important tool for forestalling conflict]{.underline}
and obtaining Chinese support for the status quo. **[China is more
likely to support an international order in which it has a seat at the
table,]{.underline}** and the Chinese Communist Party in particular
craves international recognition for its domestic political benefits.
This provides an important source of leverage for the United States to
promote its interests. In practice, [the United States can informally
recognize Chinese status as a space power through bilateral
cooperation]{.underline} between NASA and the Chinese National Space
Agency. The United States can allow China to send astronauts to the
International Space Station (while it is still operational). [Beyond the
benefits of inducing cooperation, these activities will have the added
benefit of acting as confidence building measures to reduce the
likelihood of inadvertent escalation that could lead to conflict in
space]{.underline}. As of now, the United States does not cooperate with
China in space. There are, in fact, many arguments against cooperating
with China in space -- including concerns over espionage, the PLA, and
China's opaque authoritarian government. Yet, p[essimists forget that
the United States has managed to find room for cooperation under much
more difficult circumstances]{.underline} than are present today.
[During the Cold War]{.underline}, the United States and Soviet Union
managed to cooperate in outer space despite aiming thousands of nuclear
tipped missiles at one another. By contrast, [the United States and
China are highly interdependent and are not ideological
adversaries]{.underline}. Moreover, as China's military and economy grow
increasingly dependent on space-based assets, China will also stand to
lose from a conflict in outer space. An armed space race between the
United States and China is not inevitable. However the Trump
administration's current approach to foreign policy makes it more
likely. So far, [the "America First" approach to foreign policy is
hostile to multilateralism and unlikely to recognize China's status
aspirations]{.underline}. [The current U.S. approach is likely to result
in **tat-for-tat escalation**]{.underline} -- a competition in which
China will increasingly be able to finance. U.S. policymakers would be
wise to recognize the importance of status considerations in Chinese
space program and adopt a broader toolkit for mitigating competitive
tensions in the increasingly important domain of space.

The late, great Herb London, the president of the London Center for
Policy Research who passed away this month, long argued that [China's
immediate goal is regional mastery. The country]{.underline}, which
continuously harasses U.S. ships and planes, [has one central
missio]{.underline}n at the top of mind, and that's [creating a sphere
of global influence. Recently, though, space has become a focal point of
Beijing's strategy.]{.underline} The country has bluntly stated that [it
wants to become an "aerospace superpower"]{.underline} and, in 2015, it
began creating a space force for that very reason. On Friday, it even
softly landed a rover onto the far side of the Moon, something that no
nation has ever done before. China's New Defense Strategy [China is not
increasing its presence in space just for the sake of bulking up its
defensive prowess.]{.underline} According to the International
Assessment and Strategy Center's Richard Fischer, [it's doing so "to
achieve control of low earth orbit in order to defeat the United States
on Earth." China seeks to seize Earth's ultimate high ground, where our
communications and global positioning system satellites make our
lives]{.underline} better every day. [Beijing's actions, which include
anti-satellite missile and strike vehicle tests, match up with its harsh
space rhetoric]{.underline}. As noted in a report from the U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission, **["China is pursuing a broad
and robust array of counterspace capabilities, which includes
direct-ascent anti-satellite missiles, co-orbital anti-satellite
systems, computer network operations, ground-based satellite jammers,
and directed energy weapons."]{.underline}** It is not without reason
that Lt. Gen. Steven Kwast remarked that "China is on a 10-year journey
to operationalize space" while we're on what appears to be an
unacceptable 50-year trajectory of leaving space. While President Trump
announcing the intent to craft a space force of America's own this year
was a welcome step in the right direction, [the United States is still
lagging.]{.underline} Although the United States spends more on space
and national defense than any other nation, it does so with reckless
inefficiency. Former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael
Mullen wasn't wrong when he warned that "the single, biggest threat to
our national security is debt." Proving the extent of the problem is the
Department of Defense's recent announcement that it failed its
first-ever audit. With deficit hawks like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)
sounding the alarm bell for years on how the government spends money on
needless waste, such as more than \$700,000 on a single National Science
Foundation study, which brought together researchers from four major
universities to determine whether there is a missing article in Neil
Armstrong's famous "one small step for man" quote, does this news really
surprise anyone? [If America is to remain the superpower that it is
today, it cannot acquiesce, sitting idly by as Beijing continues to
ripen its capabilities]{.underline}. In this battle of ideas, we need to
prioritize our spending so we can compete with China through innovation;
by thinking bigger, better, and faster than our adversaries. As London
had mentioned, what we need is a new Sputnik movement----a wakeup call
that arouses entrepreneurial spirit and the desire to consider
STEM-related activity for the good of the country. That will only be
achieved if we spend less on pork like robotic squirrels and more on
tools that keep America safe. NASA Is Working On This, But More Is
Needed [NASA understands the need to play an integral part in the new
space race]{.underline} and motivate the American people to contribute
to the scientific vanguard. **[It has responded by building the Space
Launch System (SLS), the biggest, most powerful rocket in U.S. history
t]{.underline}**hat will soon bring American astronauts to Mars for the
first time. [SLS is the first rocket designed for deep space exploration
since the Apollo program's Saturn V]{.underline}, which last flew in
1973, and it will have roughly 10 percent more lift, [with six times the
payload volume of any other American rocket ever created.]{.underline}
It's critical that the United States offset other budget items to
continuing developing SLS. **[Perhaps the best indication of SLS's
success comes from China's response to its progress.]{.underline}** With
recent headlines, such as **["China aims to launch a rocket larger than
NASA's SLS in 2028,"]{.underline}** arising after China National Space
Administration head Li Guoping's speech, it's clear that **[Beijing is
itching to mimic us by creating a rocket of comparable size and payload
capacity that can reach milestone exploration feats like
Mars.]{.underline}** What matters is that we thought of it and will
implement it first. That's how you win the battle of ideas. But the
United States can't win the space race with one new rocket. The key
ingredient for a pathway to victory is a sympathetic White House that's
willing to go one better than Beijing by setting ambitious goals. That
was not a strength of the previous administration, which canceled the
years-in-development Constellation program that would've sent America
back to the Moon. Thankfully, the tide appears to be turning in the
Trump administration. Just weeks ago, less than one year after [the
president signed Space Policy Directive-1, which directed NASA "to lead
an innovative and sustainable program of exploration...to enable human
expansion across the solar system,"]{.underline} NASA submitted a bold
plan to Congress that shifts the agency's purpose toward scientific
exploration and discovery, with missions to the Moon and Mars hot on its
radar. Per a NASA press release: "The Exploration Campaign builds on 18
continuous years of Americans and our international partners living and
working together on the International Space Station. [It leverages
advances in the commercial space sector, robotics and other
technologies, and accelerates in the next few years with the launch of
NASA's Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS)
rocket."]{.underline} **[None of these welcome developments would have
been possible without open ears and cooperation from officials in the
White House.]{.underline}** A Frontier Worth Exploring
[Space]{.underline} is not necessarily the final frontier, but it is a
frontier worth exploring and maintaining American leadership in. It [is
the high hill that overlooks the entire Earth.]{.underline} Over the
decades since Apollo, [America's space prowess has improved our lives
through technology advances in countless ways]{.underline} and advanced
our image as the leader of the world. Given China's stated space aims,
**[American absence likely means Chinese dominance]{.underline}**. We
have already all but ceded the capability to put humans in space to
Russia. Is it wise to cede heavy lift and deep exploration capabilities
to China? [The last thing we should do as a nation is stop here. With
China remaining as resolute as ever, U.S. policymakers cannot afford to
take their thinking caps off and must always stay two steps ahead of the
curve.]{.underline} After all, space might soon become a war-fighting
domain. [In the realm of self-defense, America has almost never sold
itself short before and it shouldn't start now.]{.underline} Here's
hoping that the Trump administration continues to shoot for the literal
stars.

Security Review*, 8-6-2018, URL:

DTS

In June 2018, President Trump directed General Joseph Dunford Jr.,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to begin laying the groundwork
for the establishment of a new military branch---in space. The stated
purpose of the new branch of service would be to protect U.S. space
interests by overseeing debris and commercial movement. Implicitly,
however, this could mark [the first overt step towards the
militarization of space, in order to maintain global hegemony and
achieve strategic dominance over rival powers like China and
Russia.]{.underline} Both countries have civilian and military space
programs of their own, but could **[this move by the Trump
administration lead to an arms race in space?]{.underline}** Ultimately,
the creation of a sixth branch of the U.S. Armed Forces would have to be
approved by Congress---and even if it isn't, [the Air Force would remain
the service branch responsible for military strategy and operations in
space as it is now.]{.underline} Regardless of what branch of the
military is responsible, what are the ramifications for the
militarization of space---by the United States and other powers?
Protecting National Interests Extends to Outer Space **[The efforts of
any one state to place armaments in space would disrupt the global
balance of power, and encourage others to follow suit, setting in motion
a race for strategic dominance that could well lead to weapons testing
and further escalation]{.underline}**. [When on actor assumes a dominant
position, rival actors will need act similarly in order to maintain
deterrence and ensure the security of their respective national
interests.]{.underline} [The rise of]{.underline} globalization and
ever-increasing [global inter-connectivity has led to a dependence on
space-based technology like]{.underline} the Global Positioning System
([GPS) for]{.underline} everything from simple navigation to the
coordination of [military operations. Such a reliance has made the
destruction of satellites a priority for military planners in the event
of a conflict.]{.underline} As the potential for space-based threats
grows, more world leaders will move to protect against the potential
destruction of their space-based assets by deploying the necessary
technology to deter such an attack. Challenges of Arms Control in Space
Though the United Nations has advocated for a complete ban on the
armament of space, it lacks the support of the United States in related
Proposed Prevention of an Arms Race in Space (PAROS) resolutions. [Since
the U.S. has such a well-developed military, civilian, and commercial
presence in space, it would be senseless to attempt to incur a treaty
without U.S. participation]{.underline}, as other states would still
feel the need to protect their interests. Beyond the question of U.S.
participation in any international conventions, a strong space-based
arms control policy would still be difficult to implement. [In space,
almost anything can be used as a weapon.]{.underline} With enough speed
in orbit, an object no larger than a rock can destroy a satellite.
Simply put, even if something is not designed to be a weapon, it can be
used as one in space. If policymakers cannot effectively identify what
constitutes a weapon in space, weapons cannot be regulated or
prohibited, making verification and enforcement close to impossible.
Consequences of Armament and Aggression in Space [The consequences of
weapons testing and aggression in space could span generations, and
current technological advances only increase the urgency for
policymakers to pursue a limitations treaty]{.underline}. As it stands,
there are three major ramifications of a potential arms race in space:
As both financial and technological barriers to the space services
industry have decreased, the number of governmental and private
investors with assets in space has inevitably increased. There is now an
abundance of satellites in space owned by multiple states and
corporations. These satellites are used to not only coordinate military
actions, but to perform more mundane tasks, like obtaining weather
reports, or managing on-ground communications, and navigation. **[Should
states begin weapons testing in space, debris could cloud the orbit and
make positioning new satellites impossible, disrupting our current way
of]{.underline}** life. More pressing, however, is that [if a country's
satellites are successfully destroyed by an enemy state, military
capabilities can be severely hindered or destroyed, leaving the country
vulnerable to attack and unable to coordinate its military forces on the
ground.]{.underline} Diminished future use of near space [Whether caused
by weapons testing or actual aggression, the subsequent proliferation of
debris around the planet would damage our future ability to access
space.]{.underline} **[Not only would debris act as shrapnel to
preexisting assets in space, but it would also become much more
difficult to launch satellites or rockets, hindering scientific
research, space exploration, and commercial operations.]{.underline}**
From the past fifty-odd years of activity in space alone, [the debris
left behind in Earth's orbital field has already become hazardous to
spacecraft]{.underline} --- a main reason why the U.S. and the Soviet
Union did not continue with ASAT testing during the Cold War. [**If
greater pollution were to occur, space itself could be become unusable,
resulting in the collapse of the global economic system, air travel, and
various communications.** Power imbalances and proliferation on the
ground]{.underline} Only so many states currently have access to
space---which means any militarization be by the few, while other states
would be left to fend for themselves. [This would establish a clear
power imbalance that could breed distrust among nations, resulting in a
more insecure world and a veritable power keg primed for
war.]{.underline} Additionally, deterrence measures taken by states with
access to space would escalate, [attempting to build up weapons caches
not dissimilar to the nuclear weapons stockpiling activities of the Cold
War. **In any arms race, it is inevitable that more advanced weaponry is
created.**]{.underline} Yet, this does not only pose a risk to assets in
space. [Should a terrestrial war break out, this weaponry may eventually
be deployed on the ground]{.underline}, and space-faring states would be
able to [capitalize on the power imbalance by using these new
developments against states that have not yet broken into the space
industry]{.underline} or developed equally-advanced weaponry. Into the
Future **[The militarization of space would inevitably increase the
chances of war, and also threaten the industries that rely on space to
carry out their daily operations.]{.underline}** Without treaties and
resolutions to regulate and limit armament in space, [the international
community risks facing extreme consequences]{.underline}. Furthermore,
with the history of U.S. disinterest in UN efforts to regulate space[,
the implementation of a meaningful, multilateral agreement for arms
control in space is unlikely.]{.underline} Ultimately, the international
community will need to regulate actions, militarization, and the
possibility of eventual armament in space sooner rather than later in
order to reduce the threat of major war, economic destruction, and
global insecurity.

### Impact -- South China Sea

#### Military operations in the SCS heighten tensions & make conflict inevitable

**Zurong 2/26** (Wu Zuron, Research Fellow, China Foundation for Int\'l
Studies, "Research Fellow, China Foundation for Int\'l Studies,"
2/26/19,
<https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/us-hegemony-and-provocations-in-the-south-china-sea>,
sg)

Since the start of 2019，the United States has already twice infringed
on China's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the South China Sea
（SCS）. On January 7, the US guided-missile destroyer USS McCampbell,
and on February 11, the guided-missile destroyers USS Spruance, and USS
Preble trespassed into China's territorial waters of the SCS Islands.
They were all warned and expelled by Chinese Navy vessels. [The US
should stop any such provocations in the SCS under the pretext of
freedom of navigation]{.underline} (FON) and overflight under
international law. [It would be beneficial to]{.underline} the US and
China, and helpful to [peace and stability in the region.]{.underline}
US military operations in the SCS are not the solution to the
differences among nations. All states，including the US，enjoy the
freedom of navigation and overflight in the SCS under international law,
including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
However, the US military operations in the SCS in recent years under the
name of the FON and overflight are different. The US FON programs, since
1979 when they began, have always had the fatal problem, i.e. the US
armed forces have conducted FON operations in territorial waters claimed
by other countries but considered by the US to be international waters.
What makes the problem even worse is the fact that the US is not a party
to the 1982 UNCLOS. The US military operations in the SCS in recent
years have demonstrated more clearly than ever that they are not a true
execution of FON operations. [Their aim is to challenge China's
sovereignty over the SCS Islands according to the US'
understanding]{.underline} and interpretation [of]{.underline} the
[international law]{.underline}. The US military often declares that it
will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law
allows. It is doing so in the SCS as in other places around the globe.
In fact, the US armed forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region,
including the SCS on a daily basis. The [strong US military presence in
the region backed by superior air and naval power is meant to deter
China from dominating the region]{.underline}. Therefore, [it is not a
secret now that the US military operations in the SCS in essence
represent the US' obstinate pursuit of maritime hegemony by challenging
China's so-called excessive territorial claims]{.underline}, [in
disregard of the fact that the SCS Islands have been China's
territory]{.underline} [for over 2,000 years.]{.underline} Clearly, the
differences between China and the US originate from different
interpretations and understanding of the international law, including
the (UNCLOS). Therefore, increasing mutual understanding through
dialogue is the better solution. [Continued US military operations in
the SCS]{.underline} in the name of the FONs [are]{.underline} not only
risky, but [harmful]{.underline}. One thing [the US military
often]{.underline} does is [create tension in the SCS to attract world
attention by using the media to highlight the US military
operations]{.underline} in international waters in the SCS. Though they
might demonstrate a powerful US military presence in the region and
create a certain degree of tension in the SCS, the US would be easily
exposed as trouble-makers who waste US tax-payers' money, while arousing
opposition from the peace-loving people in the region. The second thing
is that [the US military is trying to dispatch more naval vessels
regularly to the SCS]{.underline} to let those vessels sail more deeply
into China's territorial waters. Such plans have become risky and
consequential, as [they meet with stronger resistance from
China]{.underline}. The encounter between the Chinese navy ship and the
US guided-missile destroyer USS Decatur in the SCS on September 30,
2018, should be analyzed as a good lesson. The [US naval
entry,]{.underline} without the permission from the Chinese government,
into China's territorial waters within 12 nautical miles [constitutes an
infringement on China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity]{.underline} according to international laws and relevant
Chinese domestic laws. Suppose a Chinese destroyer, without obtaining
permission from the US government beforehand, was sailing within 12
nautical miles in the territorial waters at Key West, the US. What would
happen to it? Would it be given a warm welcome, or be asked to leave?
Though no one could give a definite answer, all would agree that the
Chinese military vessel should be prevented from entering US territorial
waters without permission. The same rule should be applied to dealing
with similar incidents in the SCS. In the case of the September 30
encounter, it is all right that the Chinese destroyer approached within
45 yards in front of the Decatur and warned it to leave the Chinese
territorial waters. And the Decatur was expelled as it maneuvered to
avoid a collision. The instance demonstrated China's resolve to
safeguard the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well
as the high level of professionalism in the Chinese Navy. It is the
Decatur that deliberately encroaches upon China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and it was the Decatur's hegemonic disregard of
the repeated warnings that led to such a close-range encounter.
Therefore, the Decatur is held responsible. According to US military
officials, [18 instances of such "unsafe and unprofessional"
maneuvers,]{.underline} as the US military called them, [occurred in the
SCS since 2016.]{.underline} [They tell the world that the US has been
trying hard to regularly infringe upon China's]{.underline} sovereignty
and territorial integrity as well as [security interests in the
SCS]{.underline}, and its repeated infringements have been firmly
prevented by Chinese naval ships with no accidents. But that doesn't
mean that no accidents would occur in the future. Therefore, in order to
prevent anything unfortunate from taking place, [it is best for the US
to stop any provocations in the SCS right now. US efforts to turn the
SCS into an international hot spot]{.underline} by ganging up against
China [are doomed to failure]{.underline}. As [ASEAN]{.underline}
[countries]{.underline} want to see China and the US work together to
contribute to peace and stability in the region, they [don't like to
take sides in the unnecessary rivalry between China and the
US]{.underline}. As a result, [the US has found it difficult to take
advantage of the differences and disputes among nations in the
region]{.underline} to fish in troubled waters. Now, under its
Indo-Pacific strategy, [the US is turning to its military allies for
help]{.underline}. As almost all of the US military allies in the world
are also China's close business partners, good friends in international
security affairs, they are reluctant to help. So far, only Britain
imitated US encroachment upon China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity once by sending its Royal Navy ship HMS Albion to trespass
into the territorial waters of China's Xisha Islands. The British Royal
Navy's provocative action not only drew protest from China, but was also
criticized by many far-sighted British people. British Defense Minister
Gavin Williamson's hawkish remarks on February 11, 2019 about the
possible voyage in the SCS of the new aircraft carrier, Queen Elizabeth,
were challenged by his colleagues in London. It tells the world that
provocation against China in the SCS is not popular in Britain. Besides,
three other military operations of US allies smacked more of political
propaganda than military significance. They are British Royal Navy's
joint drills with a US Navy ship in the SCS in January, 2019, 3
Australian Naval vessels' passage in the SCS in 2018, and 3 Japanese
naval ships' exercises in the SCS in 2017. All this shows that US
military allies are not yet ready to serve US strategic goals in the SCS
at the expense of their bilateral relations with China. Therefore, the
US would feel disappointed if it expects too much support from its
military allies. Since [prospects of the US regular provocations against
China in the SCS look dim]{.underline}, it is better for the US to put
an end to such provocations altogether so that an irritant in Sino-US
relations could be removed for the benefit of both sides.

way. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States might
have considered its global mission complete, disengaged from all but the
most vital parts of the world, and undertaken a major military
demobilization. Instead, political leaders opted for a smaller but even
more advanced and adept military, seeking to "overmatch" any potential
adversary. Along the way, the use of armed force became the tool of
first resort in American statecraft, supplanting the balanced mix of
military, diplomatic and economic power that characterized America's
Cold War strategy. Although a few policy experts and political leaders
have advocated a more restrained approach to national security,
[most]{.underline} of them, both [Republicans and Democrats, remain
committed to global primacy]{.underline} and military dominance.
**[Making the case for this requires convincing the public that the
alternatives are dangerous,]{.underline}** even frightening. The
National Defense Strategy Commission report hits this theme hard. "The
security and wellbeing of the United States are at greater risk than at
any time in decades," it warns. "[America's military
superiority]{.underline}---the hard-power backbone of its global
influence and national security---[has eroded to a dangerous
degree]{.underline}. [Rivals and adversaries are challenging the United
States on many fronts]{.underline} and in many domains. [America's
ability to defend its allies]{.underline}, its partners, and its own
vital interests [is increasingly in doubt]{.underline}. If the nation
does not act promptly to remedy these circumstances, the consequences
will be grave and lasting." [Americans are so accustomed to global
primacy]{.underline} and military dominance [that they have difficulty
imagining other options]{.underline} or seriously weighing the costs
against the benefits. The implication of this dark perspective is that
the U.S. defense budget, which is already the largest on earth by far,
needs to be increased. Just this week, the Senate Armed Services
Committee heard testimony from the commission and used it to call for
even more Pentagon funding. But what the National Defense Strategy
Commission or any equivalent group hasn't done is seriously examine or
reckon with the underlying assumptions of this orthodox strategy. For
instance, [advocates assume that without U.S. military
dominance]{.underline}, [the global system]{.underline}---or at least
some parts of it---[will devolve into conflict]{.underline} or fall
under the control of hostile nations that might keep the United States
out of the regions they monopolize. That was a valid concern during the
Cold War when America faced an expansionistic Soviet Union bent on world
domination. [But it no longer is]{.underline}. [The idea
that]{.underline} China, Russia, Iran or [some]{.underline} other
[adversary might shut out American businesses for political reasons is
farfetched in today's interconnected global economy]{.underline}. Yet
the idea that America's economic health depends on primacy and military
dominance has been repeated so often that it is an article of faith
among mainstream policy experts and political leaders. [Another
questionable assumption is that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [must]{.underline} be capable of
[militarily]{.underline} [overmatch]{.underline}ing [any potential
adversary]{.underline}. [While military dominance is certainly
nice]{.underline} to have, [the only way to sustain it is by increased
deficit spending, cutting entitlements]{.underline} like Social Security
and Medicare, diminishing investment in health care, infrastructure and
education, [or increasing taxes]{.underline}. Making the Department of
Defense more efficient, which is often touted as a magic bullet, is a
good idea, but even the National Defense Strategy Commission admitted
that [it will not be enough to sustain]{.underline}, much less increase,
[America's military dominance]{.underline}. Today though, **[Americans
are so accustomed to global primacy]{.underline}** and military
dominance **[that they have difficulty imagining other options or
seriously weighing the costs against the benefits.]{.underline}** As
Patrick Porter, a professor of strategic studies at the University of
Exeter, puts it, "[Alternative grand strategies]{.underline} based on
restraint and retrenchment [are hardly entertained]{.underline}, and
debate is narrowed into questions of execution and implementation." So
long as this continues, the United States will remain stubbornly
committed to its quest for global primacy and military dominance, hoping
against hope that some elixir of Pentagon reform and increased support
from U.S. allies will make it work. **[Eventually, though, this myth
will collapse]{.underline}**, and **[then a serious debate about
America's role in the world will really begin.]{.underline}**

Four hundred miles further north, in one of Kenya's city-sized refugee
camps, there's another sign of what global leadership used to look like:
sacks of split peas, stamped USAID; a handful of young, quiet Americans
working on idealistic development projects. I saw both this month, but
one already looks like a relic of the past. [The baton of global
leadership is being passed from the U.S. to China. In Africa, the
evidence is everywhere]{.underline}. China will put nearly \$90 billion
into the continent this year, the United States nothing close. [China is
betting big on economic partnerships and dependencies along its new Silk
Road,]{.underline} christened ["One Belt, One Road."]{.underline} [The
U.S., meanwhile, spends many of its dollars on expensive wars, to the
detriment of soft-power projects like USAID, or domestic
welfare]{.underline} programs [like Medicaid. **America's global
influence is certain to decline**]{.underline} relatively in the years
ahead; it is the inevitable consequence of the return of the Middle
Kingdom. As that happens, the U.S. should be more deliberate about the
policy choices it makes. It's a lesson I've seen my own country---which
was once an empire, too---learn the hard way. [On the way down from
global hegemony,]{.underline} [Britain came around too slowly to
investing in domestic welfare]{.underline}. The U.S. should apply those
lessons sooner. [The time is ripe]{.underline}. **[Its 45th president
swung to power on the backs of voters worn out by]{.underline}** the
burden of **[expensive wars, tired of wartime austerity, and fed up with
rising inequality]{.underline}**. **[America has spent nearly \$6
trillion]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}** sustaining long-running
conflicts in **[Afghanistan and Iraq]{.underline}**. Median wages
haven't gone up in decades. **[Its health-care inequality is a byword in
failure, infant mortality barely better than that of developing
countries, and some states' death rates are soaring]{.underline}**
because of "diseases of despair." It's clear that [many voters gave up
on the American empire]{.underline}. [When they voted in 2016, they
didn't care for the international institutions the U.S. had so carefully
constructed]{.underline} after World War II: [nato; the United Nations;
the World Bank]{.underline}. [They didn't care for their country to
protect the liberal world order]{.underline}, to lead the "Free World."
Voters on the left and the right showed their readiness for a policy
turn inwards. [They wanted a country focused on domestic
policies]{.underline}. (These are my own views, and not those of my
organization.) [A similar thing happened in Britain after World War
II]{.underline}. In 1945, the Labour leader Clement [Attlee campaigned
on bettering the lives of Britons]{.underline} at the bottom. He
promised welfare over warfare: a national health service, social
security, public housing. It won him the election; [scoring an upset win
against]{.underline} the man who had just brought Britain its finest
victory in a global war, [Winston Churchill.]{.underline} But [in the
tumultuous years that followed, Attlee wasn't]{.underline} able or
[willing to fully scale down spending on the army]{.underline} and the
Empire. When Churchill came back after him in 1951, India and other
colonies had already won their independence, but the over-spending on
foreign intervention and the military remained. **[The result was a
delay of the inevitable decline of the Empire, but also a half-baked
welfare state,]{.underline}** which couldn't provide for its citizens
the promises that Attlee envisaged. During a series of international
conflicts from the early 1950s to the early 1970s, [Britain continued to
lose not only territory]{.underline} in Africa, the Middle East, and
Asia, [but also vast amounts of money and human capital, which could
have otherwise been deployed to the betterment of its
people]{.underline}. In Cyprus, Kenya, Oman, Yemen, the Suez Canal, the
British possessions in Southeast Asia, and elsewhere, Britain spent vast
amounts in a futile effort to retain some its imperial power. I don't
long for the days of the British Empire. My family spent its
vainglorious reign digging ironstone from the ground. The imperial sun
never shone down the mine shafts of northeast England. But I know the
end of the Empire did not mean the end of Britain, or that of the
wellbeing of its citizens. Quite the contrary: the Britain I grew up in
provided me and my family with educational opportunities and health care
we'd never have known had Britain not attempted to build a welfare state
at home. Those of us on the global sidelines, [America's anxious
auxiliaries, know a collapse in the instruments of a nation's power when
it happens.]{.underline} In Britain that collapse was precipitated by
the left's loathing of imperialism. [In the United States, it has come
from the right's loathing of "globalism."]{.underline} America remains a
global power, but [in the world's capitals, policymakers are now
puzzling out which alliances and organizations will shape the
future]{.underline}. Entropy rules over empire.

### Unsustainable -- China & Russia

#### China and Russia are already undermining US hegemony

**Akram 19** Zamir Akram is the writer at the Tribue \["The new Cold
War," The Tribune, 7-2-2019, URL:
<https://tribune.com.pk/story/2004110/6-new-cold-war/>\] DTS

In the ongoing military confrontation between the US and Iran, President
Trump called off an air strike after the Iranians shot down an American
drone. This was the third sensible decision of his Presidency --- the
other two being engagement with Kim Jong-un to prevent hostilities with
nuclear-armed North Korea and the Taliban to end America's 18 years of
war in Afghanistan. These decisions are justified as examples of Trump's
commitment to avoid costly foreign wars. But the underlying factor that
has prompted such caution is the inescapable realisation that [the US is
no longer the 'sole' or 'preeminent' superpower in a 'uni-polar' world
which emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the
last 'Cold War' in 1990]{.underline}. **[With the emergence of competing
powers like China and Russia, a new 'multi-polar' world has emerged,
much to America's chagrin. These powers are no longer willing to accept
American global hegemony. T]{.underline}**oday, this is obvious not only
in the clear Chinese and Russian support for Iran against American
intimidation, but in other parts of the world as well, especially in the
Asia-Pacific and Europe. [A new Cold War has, therefore, already
started.]{.underline} The present Cold War is significantly different
and more dangerous from the last one. [Instead of a bipolar US-Soviet
confrontation with well-known defence alliances --- Nato and the Warsaw
Pact --- there are now three powers competing for influence with
shifting alliances.]{.underline} For now, [China and Russia see merit in
a strategic partnership against America whereas America's allies are
unsure about Trump's commitment to their security.]{.underline} There is
also no Iron Curtain or Berlin Wall separating the world's powers into
opposing ideological camps. [Instead there is a blurring of political,
security and economic interests]{.underline}, such as those over China's
BRI or the controversy surrounding Huawei's 5-G application by US
'allies'. In short, the global transition from a bipolar world following
end of the US-Soviet Cold War in 1990 to an America-dominated unipolar
world till 2008, has now evolved into a more complicated and complex
multi-polar world order. There was a brief period following the collapse
of the Soviet Union that provided the opportunity for creating a stable
international order. [But as the sole superpower, the US squandered this
opportunity to build mutually-beneficial and cooperative relations with
a demoralised Russia and an emerging China. Driven by 'New-Cons', the
Bush administration pursued unilateralism and preemption, aimed at
global domination and regime change]{.underline}. International support
for counterterrorism after the 9/11 attacks on the US was misused to
invade Afghanistan and then Iraq. [Russian security concerns were
ignored by expanding Nato to include East European countries along with
placement of American missiles.]{.underline} [China's offer for its
'peaceful rise' and 'harmonious relations' were countered by
strengthening military alliances with Japan, Australia, Taiwan and South
Korea and creating new 'strategic partnerships' India and
Vietnam]{.underline}. The Obama administration essentially carried out
the same 'Bush Lite' policies --- regime changes in Libya, Syria,
Georgia and Ukraine as well as the 'Pivot to Asia', coupled with
political and military support to countries that enabled the
encirclement of both Russia and China. **[It was inevitable that such
American 'Imperial Hubris' would create a push back by Russia and China.
This was facilitated by America's over-reach and crossing the limits of
its power.]{.underline}** The Russians reacted by directly intervening
in Georgia and Ukraine as well as in Syria. [The Chinese responded by
building up their defences in the Asia-Pacific, especially in the South
China Sea, and by implementing their BRI as a hedge against American
maritime containment]{.underline}. Both powers also built up their
conventional and strategic forces while entering into a strategic
partnership against the US. Trump's campaign slogan to 'make America
great again' implicitly recognised that the US had lost its preeminent
global position. Instead of accepting this reality and working with
Russia and China to ensure a stable international order, he opted for
confrontation. This zero-sum approach is clear from Trump's National
Security Strategy and National Defence Strategy both of which identify
China and Russia as enemies and call for ensuring that America "remains
the preeminent military power in the world". Sanctions have been imposed
on Russia and a trade war started with China. Meanwhile, American forces
confront those of Russia in Europe and the Middle East and the Chinese
in the Pacific. A military flare-up between them is inevitable. This new
Cold War already confronts Pakistan with daunting challenges.
Bilaterally, Washington has sanctioned Pakistan, withheld its Coalition
Support Funds, leveled allegations of supporting terrorism and demanded
a freeze on its strategic capabilities with no such demand being made on
India. The US also strongly opposes our relations with China, especially
implementation of CPEC as part of the BRI since this would neutralise
American attempts to contain China. Resultantly, Washington is trying to
undermine CPEC through multilateral financial institutions, supporting
Indian claims that CPEC passes through 'disputed territory' and
encouraging opposition to CPEC within Pakistan. [**Moreover, the US is
enabling India's conventional and strategic military build-up to
counter-balance China. This presents an existential threat to Pakistan.
America has also endorsed India's regional hegemonic ambitions which
undermine resolution of Pakistan-India disputes.** In this situation,
Pakistan's options are clearly to seek even greater political, security
and economic engagement with China as well as to broaden its relations
with Russia. Pakistan also needs to use its leverage with the US such as
its logistic and intelligence support for Washington's Afghan operations
and facilitation of the American-Taliban dialogue, to ensure as much
damage limitation as possible in relations with the US]{.underline}.
But, given the onset of the new Cold War, friendship with the US is not
possible in the foreseeable future. Given the unstinted American support
for India, there is no possibility either for normalisation of the ties
with India. The best we can achieve is conflict prevention. For this, we
must ensure continuing credible deterrence in response to the Indian
military build-up.

Theresa May, the UK\'s Prime Minister, has nearly won. Barring some
last-minute intervention, Brexit will happen \-- with or without a deal
\-- on March 29. It is the logical conclusion of May\'s strategy to
date. [Britain can get on with being an island, which it has managed
moderately well through most of its history]{.underline}, ignoring the
days of empire when it got tangled up with the rest of the world and
mistook the colonies as an extension of itself. So what place will the
UK take in the world? And more to the point, what does the wider world
even look like now? When Britain began its embrace with Brexit, few read
it as a symptom of global change \-- more a case of parochial politics
on steroids. **[Yet emerging from the miasma, the UK enters a
geopolitical landscape hard to imagine when all this
began.]{.underline}** Take, for example, the UK\'s special relationship
with the United States. [**Uncle Sam appears on track to downgrade not
just its relationship with the UK, but the whole continent of Europe.**
Past certainties are no longer certain. Today\'s America, versus the
America led by generations of previous presidents, questions
trans-Atlantic ties to the point that the NATO military alliance has
never seemed so imperiled.]{.underline} It withstood the Cold War, [but
struggles with the hot and cold vacillations of President Trump, whom,
whatever Europeans think, still commands a loyal base back home of about
one-third of American voters. **His views won\'t die with his
presidency.**]{.underline} Europe\'s post-Brexit hopes perhaps of a
successful separation will also face a rude awakening. [Once extricated
from Brexit\'s tiresome diversions, a slew of burning issues will demand
attention \-- not least the EU\'s other internal feuds and rising
nationalism questioning the core values of the union.]{.underline}
Europe now has a relationship with Iran at a variance with that of
America. And **[America is upending decades of foreign policy, demanding
a new, transactional world order that keeps it in the driving
seat.]{.underline}** The world has moved on, no matter where you live.
[Climate change is now in fact global warming. It has happened. Banning
straws and plastic bags doesn\'t even put a finger in the dyke. We are
past that. We are consuming the planet beyond its means.]{.underline}
The event horizon that precipitated all this has arrived. I can order a
jacket and new shoes on my phone on the way to work, by lunchtime they
are at my desk. But the real cost way exceeds the debit to my bank
account. **[Russia touts smarter, faster missiles than the United
States. China has militarized islands and demands acceptance of its
maritime domain.]{.underline}** [The United States is letting Kim Jong
Un and therefore China run rings around whatever passes as White House
policy on North Korea\'s nuclear weapons.]{.underline} The new world
order has arrived. The one we cherished for two generations is over.
That world order was built in the ashes of World War II and lasted as
long as the lessons of that mass slaughter existed. My mother will be 80
next month. She was born as Hitler was putting a match to his European
kindling. My father, who was 3 when the war began, today struggles to
remember his career, never mind the reasons he embarked on it. My point
is this: [The memories and minds that steered us over the past seven
stable and prosperous decades of growth with the United States at the
helm are gone.]{.underline} **[The legacy of those careful,
consensus-building leaders is replaced by populist risk-takers, willing
to roll the dice with no empirically crafted calculation of what lies on
the other side of the decision.]{.underline}** They\'ve come to the
table pockets loaded, but short on what hard knocks to a nation can feel
like. A symbol for this may be how the crisis in Venezuela is being
handled. Quick decisions are leading to lasting divisions. [Trump takes
the lead and backs self-declared interim President Juan Guaido. Europe
pauses and follows suit. China, Russia, Turkey, come down for incumbent
Nicolas Maduro, who also seems to have Saudi support.]{.underline} You
could be forgiven a sense of deja-vu, like the cold war march music
restarted. **[But this time the poles align differently, and there are
more of them, not least the suddenly unpredictable pull of Saudi Arabia
and its allies in the Middle East.]{.underline}** At its simplest level,
China is in the ascendancy and goes a little way to explain why Saudi\'s
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is falling out of favor in the
United States, is heading there soon. [Russia, not quite the pole it
once was as part of the Soviet Union, is a spoiler, eying a weakening
Europe itself undergoing realignment. And Trump, still as America\'s
President, the most powerful man in the world, holds the keys for how
turbulent the next few years will be.]{.underline}

### Unsustainable -- Domestic Pressure

#### The enmeshment of foreign policy with national identity has ensured backlash from the progressive left and ethnonationalist right. Lack of domestic support undermines the core tenants of global hegemony and ensures its collapse.

THE AMERICAN JUNGLE Of course [it is hard to support a liberal order
when liberalism is under attack at home.]{.underline} Lurking behind
**[much of the criticism of American foreign policy on both left and
right is dissatisfaction with America itself.]{.underline}** Debates
about foreign policy have often been proxies for debates about the
nation's meaning and identity, from the conflict between Hamilton and
Jefferson over the young republic's relationships with England and
Revolutionary France to the Vietnam-era debates over the rights and
wrongs of democratic capitalism. Today again the [criticisms of
America's decades-long support for a liberal international order
are]{.underline} as much [reflections of domestic battles over the
nation's identity]{.underline} as they are about foreign policy. [Belief
that America's democratic capitalist system is failing]{.underline} in
some fundamental way [at home]{.underline}, a belief [shared across the
political spectrum, has contributed to the collapse of support for an
American foreign policy designed to uphold a liberal democratic
capitalist order.]{.underline} During the Cold War, this critique came
almost exclusively from the left, and [modern "progressives" continue
that assault today.]{.underline} The Democratic Party has increasingly
become the party of "progressives." Unlike the liberals of the past, who
sought to compensate for liberal capitalism's failings but believed, in
the words of historian Sean Wilentz, that it was "a proven engine of
innovation, opportunity, and mass prosperity," many of the new
progressives revile capitalism and yearn for socialism. Not the Soviet
type, of course. They somehow believe that Sweden is a "socialist"
country, not realizing that, as Wilentz points out, Sweden is a
capitalist country, a social democracy with a welfare state. (As Ralf
Dahrendorf once quipped, "Sweden" is not Sweden; "it is a dream with no
base anywhere on the map of Europe.") And while liberals believed that
American power had been "used for good beyond our borders," without
ignoring the bad it had also done, [progressives "assume that the
exercise of American power abroad, especially military power, is almost
always malevolent."]{.underline} They see "[no significant distinction
between interventionism and imperialism]{.underline}." [They
oppose]{.underline} not only [the exercise of American
power]{.underline} but [the liberal world order itself,
which]{.underline} many [progressives view as]{.underline} nothing more
[than American hegemony on behalf of rich white men]{.underline}.175
This critique of America and its foreign policy has long been a staple
of the left, but in recent years [it has also become a prominent feature
of conservative thought.]{.underline} Traditional American conservatism
was always hostile to an activist foreign policy, which conservatives
correctly saw as strengthening the powers of the federal government and
of the executive branch. In the first half of the twentieth century,
"progressives" like Wilson and the two Roosevelts spoke of America's
"international responsibilities," while conservatives championed
"normalcy." The Cold War was an aberration, when conservatives favored
global opposition to communism, but when the Soviet Union fell, many
conservatives returned to their traditional posture. Patrick Buchanan's
1999 book, A Republic, Not an Empire, echoed the anti-federalists'
critique of the Constitution in 1787 as a blueprint for a "great and
mighty empire" that would destroy American liberties.176 [Conservative
hostility to internationalism and the liberal world order is also rooted
in a conservative critique of the Enlightenment principles]{.underline}
that helped inspire the American Revolution and which were embodied in
the Declaration of Independence. Some [conservative
intellectuals]{.underline} have preferred to [locate
America's]{.underline} [democratic virtues in the country's early
Anglo-Saxon Protestant political and cultural heritage]{.underline},
rather than in the universal principles of the Enlightenment. [This
perspective has]{.underline} sometimes [taken the form of]{.underline} a
kind of [ethnonationalism]{.underline}, in which the waves of
non-Protestant, non-Anglo-Saxon, and nonwhite immigrants are seen as
diluting the culture and traditions on which American democracy was
supposedly founded. Since debates about **[American foreign policy are
always partly debates about American identity, there has invariably been
a foreign policy component to this concern.]{.underline}** The 1920s
combined rising white nationalism, restrictive immigration policies
designed to shut off all immigration except from Northern Europe (such
that Hitler feared the United States, not Germany, would become the true
Aryan nation), with a foreign policy that explicitly repudiated
internationalism as anti-American. Many in the America First movement in
1940 took a sympathetic view of German arguments. Charles Lindbergh was
not alone in believing that a "Europe dominated by Germany" would
"maintain the supremacy of our western civilization."177 Those views
were suppressed during a war fought explicitly against Nazism and its
racial theories, and the Cold War competition brought some effort to
square America's principles with its practices. But when the Cold War
ended, some Americans returned to earlier concerns about the nation's
social and cultural identity. Samuel Huntington, in his later years,
expressed alarm that [America's Anglo-Protestant "identity" was being
swamped by "multiculturalism," and he both predicted and even cautiously
endorsed a new "white nativism" in response to the attack on whites'
"culture" and "power"]{.underline} by the expanding influence of
Hispanics.178 His post--Cold War writings about a "clash of
civilizations" urged Americans to pull back from the world and tend to
their own "Western" civilization. Such views permeate conservative and
[Republican foreign policy thinking]{.underline} today. Not only do
conservatives, and many other Americans, regard Islam as incompatible
with democracy (much as many once regarded Catholicism as incompatible
with democracy). Some [decry the very idea of liberal universalism as a
"false ideology...a cancer on our body politic." They]{.underline} not
only [criticize American support for democracy in]{.underline}
supposedly "[unfit" cultures overseas but also warn that the "import en
masse" of "people from other cultures" lacking Judeo-Christian
traditions poses a threat to democracy at home]{.underline}.179 Such
views are widespread among the nationalist populist movements in Europe,
and both Trump and his onetime top adviser, Steve Bannon, have
consistently supported and made common cause with those abroad who share
this anxiety for the preservation of white Christian culture against
dark-skinned, non-Christian immigrants. These attacks on the
Enlightenment universalism on which the country was founded should not
be dismissed as cranky aberrations. The United States also has its
"subterranean stream" running through its history, from the slaveholding
South to the Know-Nothings to the white supremacists of the Jim Crow era
and the revival of the Klan of the 1920s to the alt-right of today.
[Although we prefer to forget or downplay the whole boiling cauldron of
angers and hatreds and resentments which have been such a big part of
our history, the jungle grows in America, too.]{.underline} Americans
may well come out of it, at least partly, as they have in the past.
Their politicians can run roughshod over institutions and even over the
Constitution, but Americans cannot escape the principles of the
Declaration, even if they want to. They have nowhere else to go. Other
nations can fall back on blood-and-soil nationalism, but Americans have
no such nationalism to fall back on, regardless of what Trump and his
white nationalist supporters might wish. Huntington and others miss a
critical point about the founding of the American republic. The authors
of the Declaration of Independence were indeed Anglo-Protestants, most
of whom did not believe that Catholics were fit for democracy (nor were
women, much less blacks or Asians or Muslims). However, they consciously
and explicitly rejected the idea that the rights they claimed derived
from their status as Englishmen, nor did they claim that only
Anglo-Protestants could be trusted to protect and advance those rights.
They even recognized that the slavery they wrote into the Constitution
contradicted their universalist claims and anticipated the day when
slavery would wither and the contradiction would be resolved. The
universal principles they enshrined in the Declaration had more lasting
power than the Anglo-Protestant culture from which they sprang. These
continued to be the driving force in American life---the "apple of
gold," as Lincoln put it---superseding even the Constitution, ultimately
leading to the abolition of slavery, the promise of rights for former
slaves and for every group that followed, regardless of religion or
cultural background. The continual expansion of rights to protected
minorities is the one constant in American history. That is the essence
of America as it was established by the founders, and though Americans
often stray from it, eventually they are tugged back. **[For as long as
the latest eruption of Americans' subterranean stream lasts, however, it
will be hard for the United States to pull out of its current trajectory
and begin the climb back to international responsibility]{.underline}**.
To sustain a foreign policy of enlightened self-interest requires
enlightenment, a degree of generosity, a belief in the universalism of
rights, and, yes, a measure of cosmopolitanism that Americans have not
lately been displaying. The danger is that [by the time they come out of
their current mood, it may be too late to repair the damage and stem the
forces of nature and history.]{.underline}

national character, the phrase that I use in my work and thinking is
\"national identity.\" I gradually realized that national identity for
different countries depends on different things. For example, I\'ve just
come back from several weeks in Italy, where I was teaching at Rome\'s
Social Science University. Italians have a national identity. But what
they are proud about is not what Americans are proud about. Italians are
proud about their style, their history of the Roman Empire, their
cuisine, their friendliness, their social relationships with other
Italians and their great art, of course. Whereas for people from
Finland, their national identity depends upon their unique language and
having survived war against the Soviet Union. In the United States, our
national identity depends upon our having conquered a continent and our
being the most powerful country in the world. In Germany, national
identity used to depend upon military feats which are now regarded as
evil. German national identity now depends upon some features of German
national character, namely the role of the community where in many cases
it takes precedence over the role of the individual in society. Germans
have great pride in their art and music. How do countries respond to a
crisis in national identity and meaning? [Donald Trump and his movement
are one such crisis afflicting the United States in this
moment.]{.underline} Slowly. My new book examines national crises from
the perspective of personal crises in identity. When we change our
personal identities, we can work through it more quickly because it
involves just one person, us. [National identities inevitably get
changed more slowly because it requires arriving at a consensus for a
whole country.]{.underline} For example, in the book I discuss the slow
change in national identity for Australia, which took place over several
decades from the time I first visited Australia in 1964. Since then,
Australians have gradually been discarding what had been their national
identity. This had been based on: \"We, Australians being loyal British
citizens, we are the British outpost near Asia.\" Well, that identity
gradually got discarded as a result of events in 1941 and 1942 in World
War II, then Britain\'s application to the European Union, and
Australia\'s increasing trade with Asia. This process took decades and
decades. [Similarly, with the United States we are changing our vision
of the country\'s national identity. It\'s going to take us time, so it
will happen slowly.]{.underline} I do not think it is going to take the
country several decades as it did Australia, but it certainly is going
to take more than a year or two. In what ways should a country navigate
such times of change in order to be successful? How can the United
States manage this in a healthy way? A starting point would be \"We need
to be honest.\" [**There is a big deficit in honesty in the United
States at present in talking about our country\'s problems**. A very
specific example: a lack of honesty about immigration.]{.underline}
There are these arguments about putting up a wall on the Mexican border.
Well, the fact is that the [great majority of people who are in the
United States as so-called illegal immigrants have not come across the
Mexican border]{.underline}. Instead, [they\'ve come to the United
States on legal visas and then they\'ve overstayed them]{.underline}.
Therefore, the discussion about the wall is tangential. In addition, if
we are concerned about people coming across the Mexican border, the
preferred ways to get across the Mexican border are to wade across the
Rio Grande or to go through tunnels. **[These proposals about Trump\'s
wall are a prime example of dishonesty and ignoring the
facts]{.underline}**. What are other examples of things that the United
States and its leaders and people are dishonest about? We need to be
honest about what is good about the United States and what needs to be
changed. Things that are good include that we are still the most
powerful and richest country in the world. America has wonderful
geography. The United States is protected on two sides by oceans and on
the other two sides by non-threatening neighbors. We have the richest
farmland in the world. We have the best institutions of higher education
in the world. We have a long history of freedom, relatively speaking.
There are gaps in our freedom, of course, but compared to other
countries, the United States has a track record of freedom. Those are
things that we as a people can be proud of. We can also be proud of the
crises that we as a people have overcome in the past, such as the Civil
War. I grew up in World War II, and we survived that. As a country, the
United States survived the arguments over the civil rights movement.
There is so much that we Americans can be proud of. We do not need to
talk about making America great again. America is already great. There
are not new things that have to be added to make America. America\'s
already great. There are mistakes that we\'re making, though, and we\'d
better sort those out. Of course you can\'t predict the future. But what
are some system shocks that you believe could cause great change and
disruption in the United States in the near term? [Possible sources of
unexpected big shocks, of course, would include another terrorist
attack. Still another would be a really big massacre within the United
States. Getting 59 people killed]{.underline} or 11 people killed
[doesn\'t attract attention anymore in America]{.underline}. **[Maybe
getting 530 people killed]{.underline}**, not by a World Trade
Center-like attack, but by some gunman within the United States. If the
530 people killed were schoolchildren, that might attract attention[. A
big weather shock would convince even diehard disbelievers in climate
change that there really is a problem.]{.underline} I\'m concerned that
the United States is no longer dreaming big any more. **[The country has
become so insular and narrow-minded, turned inward]{.underline}**. Is
that a common trait for societies in crisis? It\'s true that during the
1960s we had the big goal of going to the Moon and we achieved that.
There is a widespread view, particularly in conservative circles in the
United States, that for government to do something is \"socialism\" and
that \"socialism\" is bad. But the fact is that ever since the first
central government arose 5,400 years ago, government can do things that
cannot be done properly or well by private interests. Private interests
do not do something with their own resources, generally, that do not
bring them direct benefits. Instead, things that produce diffuse
benefits --- such as school systems or national health systems or
national support for scientific research --- are what government is for.
[Unfortunately there is an increasingly widespread view in the United
States today against the role of government in providing those benefits
and services.]{.underline} What are some lessons from history about how
the United States can make good decisions about this moment of change?
[I would start off with the worst problem]{.underline} in the United
States today --- [the breakdown of political compromise]{.underline}. I
was living in Chile a few years before the military coup d\'état \[in
1973\] when Chileans were proud of their democracy. They didn\'t foresee
that Chilean democracy would be finished within seven years and they
would have a military dictatorship which smashed world records for
sadism. A great and ambitious plan for America would be to raise
seriously the dangers of a breakdown in political compromise, which has
the potential to ruin America as it did Chile and Indonesia. We must
work hard and make sure that such an outcome does not happen here.
[Donald Trump and many of his allies and supporters want to change
immigration policies to keep nonwhites from coming into the country.
Immigration is a net positive for the United States, and those kinds of
backwards and reactionary policies will damage the country\'s
economy.]{.underline} Many experts point to Japan as a country whose
immigration policy has hurt its economy. Do you think that\'s a fair
comparison? I would say that there is nothing that we Americans can
learn from Japan with regards to immigration policy. Instead, as you
say, immigration involves pluses and minuses. Each country has to come
to its own weighing of those pluses and minuses. Japan and Australia
have taken opposite views about that. In Japan, homogeneity of the
population and shared values are big economic sacrifices. Their national
identity through their homogeneity is so important that the Japanese are
willing to suffer all the losses they experience by not having
immigrants. Australia has paid immigrants to come in, and within recent
decades has changed its immigration policies to accept immigrants from
all over the world. In the case of the United States, we are at the
opposite extreme from Japan. We\'re a country based on diversity. The
United States has accepted immigrants from all over the world. There is
nothing we can learn from Japan except that the Japanese have a
different point of view which is undoubtedly not the American point of
view. What do we get out of immigrants? We have skilled immigrants and,
so-called unskilled immigrants. The United States has the highest
percentage of skilled immigrants of any country. A measure of that is
that among American Nobel Prize winners, the majority are either
first-generation immigrants or the children of first-generation
immigrants. That is because to win the Nobel prize, you have to be bold,
you have to take risks, you have to be young and healthy, you have to do
things that other people lack the courage to do. Well, that\'s also what
it takes to be an immigrant. As for what we get from our unskilled
immigrants: Here in Los Angeles, the construction crews are
Spanish-speaking people from south of the border. The taxi drivers in
Washington, D.C., the last time that I was there, were mostly Ethiopian
or Somali. The taxi drivers in Los Angeles are now mostly from the
Middle East. The United States gets good use out of our skilled
immigrants and our unskilled immigrants. What are your concerns about
globalization? [Globalization is a fact. There\'s very little that we
can do to control it. Definitions are important. Globalization includes
increased communication. Globalization also means more movement of
people around the world from poor countries to rich countries. That is
actually a dynamic that we can do something about. There would be less
incentive for people to leave poor countries if we made poor countries
richer.]{.underline} For a small amount of money, one can make big
improvement in the economies of poor countries, and that then means less
drive for immigration. It also means more satisfaction and therefore
less support for terrorists. Those are things that we can actually do
about the aspects of globalization that are of concern in the United
States and the West. Why is your work so controversial in some circles?
[Your scholarship is highly respected by some while being hated by
others --- to the point where you sometimes need to have security at
your talks]{.underline}. Among academics, particularly left-wing
anthropologists, there are those who hate me. There are two reasons. One
is jealousy. My books are successful. They do not write successful books
because they don\'t try to --- and if they try to, they don\'t know how
to write successful books. So that\'s one piece of it. A second reason
that some academics dislike my books is that they equate geography with
what is called \"geographic determinism.\" That is not something that I
argue for. Instead, they misread my work or because they haven\'t
actually read \"Guns, Germs and Steel,\" these critics think that
mentioning geography means geographic determinism. Geography determines
some things we do and not others. Those are the two main reasons why a
vocal minority of people hate my work. One of the dominant narratives at
present is that the United States is in decline and that this is the
true end of the American century. In this reading of history, the future
belongs to China. Do you agree with that argument and conclusion? Such a
narrative is complete nonsense. The United States is not in decline.
[The only thing that could cause the United States to decline would be
the bad policies of the United States]{.underline}. **[There is no way
that China is going to catch up with the United States unless we ruin
ourselves.]{.underline}** What advice would you give to America\'s
leaders to help them make good decisions that sustain the country\'s
dominant position? Ruining ourselves is something the United States is
doing now in four ways. One is political polarization. A second is
restrictions on voting, because democracy is a good thing. Democracy is,
as Winston Churchill said, \"the worst form of government except for all
others that have been tried.\" With restrictions on voting, we are
undermining our democracy. We have reduced socioeconomic mobility in
America so that it is now lower than in any other major democracy. We
are reducing government investment for the public good. Those four
things are the ways in which we are undermining ourselves as a country
right now. All America has to do to stay on top of the world is to stop
doing those four things.

[There are two conventional ways of understanding America's global
role]{.underline}. [According to one]{.underline} theory, the bipolar
world of the Cold War has given way to a unipolar world in which [the
United States is the undisputed hegemon.]{.underline} Some observers see
this as a good thing and champion American empire, while others see it
as a bad thing and seek to resist American empire, but both sides agree
that American empire is the defining feature of our era. [A second
theory]{.underline}, only different from the first by degrees, [asserts
that the post-Cold War world is multipolar]{.underline}, with the United
States as the clear dominant power among many potential rivals,
including countries such as China that might conceivably surpass the
United States down the line. But what if **[neither theory is
correct]{.underline}**? [The near-universal understanding of
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as a
powerful, unified global actor is flawed]{.underline} and in need of
revision. [The United States is]{.underline} less a great power exerting
its will and [more an open-air market for global
corruption]{.underline}, in which [outside powers can purchase
influence, shape political outcomes, and play factions against each
other]{.underline} in the service of their own competing agendas. That's
a familiar historical story. Although Foundation drew its direct
inspiration from Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire, [history is replete with examples of seemingly powerful empires
run by weak, divided elites]{.underline} and picked apart by outside
powers. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a vast aristocratic republic
that dominated Eastern Europe in one form or another from the 14th to
the 18th century, was wiped off the map by its neighbors, who found they
could bribe its senators into paralyzing all political decisions. [The
Ottoman Empire]{.underline} of the mid-19th century [was]{.underline}
infamously [dubbed "the sick man of Europe" as]{.underline} Western
[European powers]{.underline} [chipped away at its
territories]{.underline} and encouraged independence movements against
it. During the same period, [China under the Qing Dynasty was forced to
give up numerous territorial concessions to European]{.underline}
colonial [empires]{.underline}---all of which, in turn, would themselves
disintegrate within a century. [It may seem absurd to compare
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates in 2019
[to]{.underline} the [decadent and crumbling imperial powers of the
past]{.underline}. **[But consider the state of the capital right
now.]{.underline}** President **[Donald Trump]{.underline}**, as almost
everyone at least privately concedes, [**is incompetent at fulfilling
his most basic responsibilities and a global laughingstock.** Trump's
administration is openly bought by foreign governments]{.underline} [via
his international network of hotels]{.underline} and resorts, including
the one located directly between the White House and the U.S. Capitol,
where a Saudi-funded lobbyist rented 500 rooms in the month after the
2016 election. His political party, which still controls the Senate and
increasingly dominates the judiciary, has no interest in holding him
accountable for any of this. And of course there's the small matter of
Russian interference [in the 2016 election]{.underline}; as the limited
information known so far from special counsel Robert Mueller's report
confirms, [Trump and the Republicans were]{.underline} at the very least
[the passive and willing beneficiaries of efforts by a foreign power to
influence the election outcome. **But Trump is only a
symptom**]{.underline}, [the most blatant]{.underline} and cartoonish
[example of how **the influence of outside money in Washington has
become routine**]{.underline} over the past generation. From the
pervasive influence of the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf
monarchies over think tanks and media organizations to virtually the
entire U.S. government kowtowing before the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee to China's warm relationship with the Chamber of
Commerce and with the heads of some of the most powerful U.S. companies
to the funneling of foreign money through the real estate industries of
the country's largest and wealthiest cities---the U.S. government is for
sale. To be sure, it isn't only, or even primarily, foreign money that
rules Washington. [Powerful corporate interests]{.underline} in general
[have]{.underline} almost completely [crowded out democratic
accountability in the capital]{.underline}, including major U.S.-based
industries such as finance, insurance, energy, and tech. Then again, [is
there any such thing as a U.S.-based industry anymore?]{.underline} Most
of [the biggest companies are multinational]{.underline}, with
headquarters in major cities around the world and executives whose
staggering wealth means they have more in common socially with their
international counterparts than with most Americans. The complete
deregulation of campaign finance and the subsequent legalization of
corruption in Washington, on a scale unheard of in other developed
countries, have resulted in a capital where the distinction between
foreign and domestic monied interests is harder and harder to parse.
[The U.S. government]{.underline}, in other words, does not exist to
serve the interests of Americans through either its foreign or its
domestic policies; rather, it [exists to perpetuate the interests of the
globalized oligarchy]{.underline}. [There's an obvious counterargument
to all of this:]{.underline} The United States still spends more on
defense than the next seven countries combined, and it still operates a
network of hundreds of military bases spread across nearly half the
countries on Earth. [No other country remotely rivals the United
States]{.underline} in its ability to project [military
power]{.underline}. And no other country is as wealthy or mints the
global reserve currency or wields as much soft power. At the same time,
[focusing entirely on the American empire from the top down can confuse
causality]{.underline}. Focusing entirely on the American empire from
the top down can confuse causality. [Consider]{.underline}, for
instance[, the overthrow of Egypt's]{.underline} post-Arab Spring
elected leader [Mohamed Morsi in a 2013 coup]{.underline}. In former
White House advisor [Ben Rhodes]{.underline}'s memoir, he
[describes]{.underline} President Barack [Obama's
administration]{.underline} not as the driving force behind this coup
but [as the passive recipient of relentless pressure from its Saudi and
Emirati allies]{.underline}, who waged an information campaign against
the U.S. ambassador while plotting with the Egyptian military. Rhodes
writes that he personally received a photo in the mail portraying the
U.S. ambassador as an accomplice of the Muslim Brotherhood from Yousef
al-Otaiba, the ubiquitous, hard-partying, extremely well-connected
Emirati ambassador in Washington. While [Rhodes and Obama]{.underline}
also faced pressure from within the Washington establishment, they
[found their agenda for the Middle East repeatedly hijacked by foreign
allies]{.underline}---the same governments that also lobbied, with
varying success, for U.S. military operations from Syria to Yemen.
**[American power, however mighty, means nothing if it's being used for
the ends of the highest bidders.]{.underline}** So what if **[the
American empire is coming apart at the seams]{.underline}**? Good
riddance, many would say. **[U.S. hegemony has been a
disaster]{.underline}**, **[spreading war and exploitation around the
globe and poisoning the climate beyond repair]{.underline}**. And that's
true: As Asimov observed, empires tend to fall because they overextend
themselves, spoil their elites, and produce the preconditions for their
own demise. But what we're seeing is neither a considered, responsible
withdrawal from empire in order to invest in urgent needs at home nor a
revolt against empire by the world's wretched. Rather, **[it's a
drawn-out, decadent collapse]{.underline}** recognizable to any student
of Rome or Constantinople. **[America is the sick man of the 21st
century]{.underline}**, and anyone who has watched its president bumble
through a gathering of bemused, pitying world leaders knows it.

### Unsustainable -- LIO/Alliances

#### US hegemony fails -- liberal internationalism and neoconservatism result in recalcitrance and a divided world order

In a recent interview with CNN\'s Chris Cuomo, former Vice President Joe
Biden made his position on America\'s role in the world abundantly
clear. \"I come out of a generation where we were trying to be the
policemen of the world,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said
nostalgically, before condemning President [Donald Trump for \"dissing\"
our allies in NATO and embracing \"thugs\" like North Korean leader Kim
Jong-Un. \"He\'s embracing Putin, who is a flat dictator]{.underline},\"
continued Biden, who then predicted that if Trump wins reelection in
2020, \"[there will be no NATO in four years or five
years.\"]{.underline} In just a few sentences, Biden summarized an
attitude towards foreign policy that has been traditionally known as
\"liberal internationalism,\" one of the two dominant worldviews in
American politics since the end of the Cold War. [Liberal
internationalism shares many of the same attitudes and commitments as
the other leading post-Cold War ideology, neoconservatism. They are both
committed to American hegemony and a unipolar world order, although the
latter favors military intervention while the former typically prefers
non-interventionist strategies like diplomacy and economic
liberalization]{.underline} (i.e. free trade). Likewise, **[they both
regard \"American values\" as universal, and therefore believe that the
U.S. is not only entitled but obligated to promote these values around
the world, sometimes by force.]{.underline}** The former Secretary of
State under Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright, summed up the common
attitude of liberal internationalists and neoconservatives when she
famously referred to the United States as an \"indispensable nation\" in
the late nineties. [Both worldviews assume that America is
exceptional]{.underline}, and that the country has a unique destiny to
lead (and police) the world. This mindset goes way back, and can be
traced to the 18th-century Enlightenment tradition that influenced the
country\'s founders (which itself grew out of the messianic spirit of
Christianity), but after the collapse of the Soviet Union the missionary
zeal that shaped American foreign policy during the 20th century became
all the more aggressive and arrogant on the global stage, with liberal
internationalists like Joe Biden leading the charge. In his 2017 book,
Near Abroad: Putin, the West, and the Contest Over Ukraine and the
Caucus, political geographer Gerard Toal distinguishes between
\"normative\" and \"pragmatic\" practices in American foreign policy,
and both liberal internationalism and neoconservatism clearly fall into
the former category. Normative geopolitics, he writes, \"concerns
aspirational and ideal visions of world order --- how things \'ought to
be\' in the abstract without reference to constraints and necessary
compromises.\" To believers in the normative vision of \"liberal
utopianism,\" as he calls it, [the United States is not seen as \"an
ordinary territorial state but as the expression of universal ideals and
values, the homeland of freedom, the land of liberty.\"]{.underline}
Toal makes a further distinction between \"thin geopolitics,\" which
aligns with normative visions (and is exemplified by the infamous Cold
War \"domino theory\"), and \"thick geopolitics,\" which rests on
\"recognition of the importance of spatial relationships and in-depth
knowledge of places and peoples.\" [Thick geopolitics is grounded in the
\"messy heterogeneity of the world,\" and \"recognizes that local
conditions matter, that agency is rarely singular, that power is
exercised geographically]{.underline}, and that location, distance, and
place influence its operation.\" **[The many failures of American
foreign policy over the past 30 years can be largely attributed to the
predominance of normative visions and thin geopolitics among American
leadership, both Republican and Democrat]{.underline}**. After the fall
of communism, a triumphalism quickly spread through Washington, forming
a bipartisan consensus around the \"end of history\" thesis. [The
victory of capitalism over communism had apparently proven that liberal
democracy was the highest form of government and that \"American
values\" were universal.]{.underline} With history on our side, it
became simply a matter of exporting our values and systems. Though
neoconservatism was widely discredited after the Iraq War --- which,
like the [Vietnam War, exposed America\'s imperial arrogance and the
geopolitical ignorance of our best and brightest --- the liberal
internationalist worldview remained largely intact]{.underline}. In
2016, Donald Trump represented a backlash against neoconservatism in the
Republican Party, and his victory essentially put a nail in the
movement\'s coffin. He questioned the relevance of NATO, said the Iraq
War was possibly the worst decision \"ever made in the history of this
country,\" and rejected America\'s role as the global policeman. In the
general election, Hillary Clinton represented liberal internationalism
against Trump\'s isolationism, which led many neoconservative
Republicans to support the Democratic candidate over their own party\'s
nominee. The failures of liberal internationalism aren\'t as obvious (or
consequential) as the failures of neoconservatism, but [much of the
global instability that we are experiencing today is a direct result of
policies pursued by liberals like Joe Biden over the past few decades. A
perfect example of this is the expansion of NATO]{.underline}, which
began under Bill Clinton and continued under George W. Bush. **[This
bipartisan action was arguably one of the most reckless and
ill-conceived policies of the post-Cold War era. The eastward expansion
of NATO has always been perceived by Russia as Western
aggression]{.underline}** (or at least provocation), but in the 1990s
the country was too weak to do anything about it. However, as the author
Tony Wood writes, \"enforced passivity should not have been mistaken for
willing acceptance.\" In 1990, George H. W. Bush\'s Secretary of State,
James Baker, had a now-infamous conversation with Mikhail Gorbachev,
where he promised the Soviet leader that if he pulled Soviet troops out
of East Germany and allowed a peaceful reunion of the country, NATO
would not move \"one inch east.\" As Richard Lourie points out in his
book Putin: His Downfall And Russia\'s Coming Crash, [NATO moved \"not
inches but hundreds of miles east,\" granting membership to former
Soviet republics and seven former Eastern Bloc countries between 1999
and 2004.]{.underline} The U.S. ambassador to the USSR during the height
of the Cold War, George Kennan, said at the time that expanding **[NATO
was a \"strategic blunder of potentially epic proportions,\" and
accurately predicted that it would lead to a revival of \"nationalistic,
anti-Western and militaristic tendencies in Russian
opinion.\"]{.underline}** The two 2020 Democratic presidential
candidates in Congress at the time, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, had
very different positions on NATO expansion. While the Vermont senator
has long opposed the eastward expansion of NATO, Biden has been one of
the most zealous advocates of the policy for the past 25 years. \"Since
the Cold War is over,\" asked Sanders in 1997, \"why are we militarily
provoking Russia?\" More than 20 years later, it\'s clear that the
concern expressed by Sanders and other critics like Kennan was
justified, yet you wouldn\'t know it by listening to Biden today.
Delivering what was billed as a major foreign policy address this past
week, he bragged that [NATO defense spending had increased under the
Obama administration and touted the organization as an \"alliance of
values.]{.underline}\"

For the past half-century, U.S. strategists, the State Department and
National Endowment for Democracy (NED) worried that opposition to U.S.
financial imperialism would come from left-wing parties. It therefore
spent enormous resources manipulating parties that called themselves
socialist (Tony Blair's British Labour Party, France's Socialist Party,
Germany's Social Democrats, etc.) to adopt neoliberal policies that were
the diametric opposite to what social democracy meant a century ago. But
U.S. political planners and Great Wurlitzer organists neglected the
right wing, imagining that it would instinctively support U.S.
thuggishness. [The reality is that right-wing parties want to get
elected, and a populist nationalism is today's road to election victory
in Europe and other countries]{.underline} just as it was for Donald
Trump in 2016. T[**rump's agenda may really be to break up the American
Empire**, using]{.underline} the old Uncle Sucker [isolationist rhetoric
of half a century ago. He certainly is going for the Empire's most vital
organs]{.underline}. But it he a witting anti-American agent? He might
as well be -- but it would be a false mental leap to use "quo bono" to
assume that he is a witting agent. After all, [if no U.S. contractor,
supplier, labor union or bank will deal with him, would Vladimir Putin,
China or Iran be any more naïve?]{.underline} Perhaps the problem had to
erupt as a result of **[the inner dynamics of U.S.-sponsored globalism
becoming impossible to impose when the result is financial austerity,
waves of population flight from U.S.-sponsored wars, and most of all,
U.S. refusal to adhere to the rules and international
laws]{.underline}** that it itself sponsored seventy years ago in the
wake of World War II. Dismantling international law and its courts [Any
international system of control requires the rule of law]{.underline}.
It may be a morally lawless exercise of ruthless power imposing
predatory exploitation, but it is still The Law. And it needs courts to
apply it ([backed by police power to enforce it and punish
violators]{.underline}). Here's the first legal contradiction in U.S.
global diplomacy[: The United States always has resisted letting any
other country have any voice in U.S. domestic policies, law-making or
diplomacy. **That is what makes America "the exceptional
nation**]{.underline}." But for seventy years [its diplomats have
pretended that its superior judgment promoted a peaceful
world]{.underline} (as the Roman Empire claimed to be), which let other
countries share in prosperity and rising living standards. [At the
United Nations, U.S. diplomats insisted on veto power. At the World Bank
and IMF they]{.underline} also [made sure]{.underline} that [their
equity share was large enough to give them veto power over any loan or
other policy]{.underline}. Without such power, the United States would
not join any international organization. Yet at the same time, it
depicted its nationalism as protecting globalization and
internationalism. [It was all a euphemism for what really was unilateral
U.S. decision-making.]{.underline} Inevitably, U[.S. nationalism had to
break up the mirage of One World internationalism, and with it any
thought of an international court. Without veto power]{.underline} over
the judges, [the U.S. never accepted the authority of any
court]{.underline}, in particular the United Nations' International
Court in The Hague. Recently that court undertook an investigation into
U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan, from its torture policies to bombing of
civilian targets such as hospitals, weddings and infrastructure. "That
investigation ultimately found 'a reasonable basis to believe that war
crimes and crimes against humanity.'"1 Donald Trump's National Security
Adviser John Bolton erupted in fury, warning in September that: "[The
United States will use any means necessary to protect our citizens and
those of our allies from unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court,"
adding that the UN International Court must not be so bold as to
investigate "Israel or other U.S. allies."]{.underline} That prompted a
senior judge, Christoph Flügge from Germany, to resign in protest.
Indeed, Bolton told the court to keep out of any affairs involving the
United States, promising to ban the Court's "judges and prosecutors from
entering the United States." As Bolton spelled out the U.S. threat: "[We
will sanction their funds in the U.S. financial system, and we will
prosecute them in the U.S. criminal system. We will not cooperate with
the ICC. We will provide no assistance to the ICC. We will not join the
ICC. We will let the ICC die on its own]{.underline}. After all, for all
intents and purposes, the ICC is already dead to us." What this meant,
the German judge spelled out was that: "[If these judges ever interfere
in the domestic concerns of the U.S. or investigate an American citizen,
\[Bolton\] said the American government would do all it could to ensure
that these judges would no longer be allowed to travel to the United
States -- and that they would perhaps even be criminally prosecuted."
The original inspiration of the Court]{.underline} -- to use the
Nuremburg laws that were applied against German Nazis to bring similar
prosecution against any country or officials found guilty of committing
war crimes -- [had already fallen into disuse with the failure to indict
the authors of the Chilean coup, Iran-Contra or the U.S. invasion of
Iraq for war crimes.]{.underline}

### Unsustainable -- Military

#### US Hegemony fails -- military culture, hubris, grand strategy, incompatible tech

Since the end of World War II, [the American military has been described
so often by defense analysts, military historians, and U.S. presidents
as the most lethal armed force in history that it's become a
cliché]{.underline}. During the Cold War, Moscow claimed with some
validity to have military capabilities on a par with the United States.
But [since the demise of the Soviet Union and America's crushing victory
over Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War of 1990-1991, no serious student of
military affairs of whom I'm aware disputes the reality of American
military supremacy.]{.underline} The most capable military in history is
also by far and away the most expensive. The United States will spend at
least \$650 billion on defense this fiscal year, which is more than the
next seven nations' spending combined. All of this begs an awkward but
important question: **[Why can't the most lethal military establishment
in history win its wars?]{.underline}** The military's scorecard since
the world-changing victory in 1945 has been, in a word, underwhelming.
[In Korea, an ill-prepared American army was almost driven off the
peninsula in its first few months of combat in 1950.]{.underline}
Ultimately, the American-led U.N. army did oust communist forces from
South Korea, but it was driven to the brink of defeat (again!) before it
did so. In November 1950, the Chinese People's Army entered the fray and
drove the U.N. army out of North Korea, frustrating its goal of unifying
the two Koreas under a pro-Western government. After assuming the burden
of the fighting from the South Vietnamese in 1965, [the U.S. military
found itself bogged down in a long, bloody, and indecisive war against
the North Vietnamese regular army and Vietcong guerrillas. After eight
years of inconclusive fighting, the United States had dropped more bombs
on Vietnam than it did on Germany and Japan in World War
II.]{.underline} The Communists, however, wouldn't give up. The
Americans withdrew, leaving the South Vietnamese to certain defeat at
the hands of their communist adversaries. [In the Lebanese civil war of
the early '80s, American forces were withdrawn soon after a Jihadist
terrorist set off a truck bomb, blowing up a Marine barracks and killing
241 U.S. Marines.]{.underline} The lightning-fast victory in the Gulf
War of 1990-1991 resurrected the U.S. military's prestige from the ashes
of Vietnam and ushered in an entirely new way of war. As the strategist
Andrew Marshall put it soon after victory, "the information dimension
has become central to the outcome \[of modern conflicts\]... Long-range
precision strike weapons coupled with systems of sensors and a command
and control system will come to dominate much of warfare." "**[Early and
dramatic success in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq was soon followed
by year after year of frustrating, inconclusive operations and political
setbacks."]{.underline}** Yet many historians today view the Gulf War
not as the great victory it appeared to be in 1991 but rather as the
first campaign in a long, ultimately unwinnable civil war in Iraq that
has never truly ended. In the wake of the Gulf War, a new foreign policy
consensus emerged. America, said Madeleine Albright, Bill Clinton's
secretary of state, was the ["world's indispensable nation," with both a
right and an obligation to enforce the rules-based international order
and take out bad guys.]{.underline} Between 1990 and 1997, the military
was deployed on more than 30 operations of bewildering
variety---peacekeeping, peace enforcement, humanitarian relief, and
traditional combat missions. Most of these deployments came up short of
their objectives. [The most infamous was the effort to stabilize the
failing state of Somalia. That led to an undeclared war between Somali
warlord Mohamed Aidid and U.S. forces, culminating in the Battle of
Mogadishu]{.underline}. Eighteen American soldiers were killed in
furious combat; American corpses were dragged through the angry streets.
Soon after the battle, President Clinton withdrew all American forces
from Somalia. Then came 9/11 and the global War on Terror. Early and
dramatic success in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq was soon followed
by year after year of frustrating, inconclusive operations and political
setbacks. [The Taliban today is stronger than it was when American
forces first deployed to Afghanistan in 2001. When Obama withdrew
American forces from Iraq in December 2011, the country was awash in
sectarian violence, and any hope of establishing a pro-Western,
democratic regime there had vanished]{.underline}. Iraq was a war,
writes journalist George Packer, "conceived in deceit and born in
hubris, a historic folly that took the American eye off Al Qaeda and the
Taliban, while shattering Iraq into a million bloody pieces." What
explains this unenviable record of achievement? **[Some analysts locate
the problem within the military's culture.]{.underline}** [Most of
America's opponents]{.underline} in operations since World War II, and
particularly since the end of the Cold War, [have been non-state actors
and insurgents highly skilled and resourceful in taking on conventional
military forces in "asymmetrical warfare."]{.underline} [**American
forces have been trained, organized and indoctrinated in conventional
operations using high-tech weaponry, so they have been fighting with a
considerable handicap.** Certainly, this issue was in play during
Vietnam, and in the Iraq War, when the Army found itself out of its
depth in confronting a complex insurgency after seizing Baghdad with
relative ease]{.underline}. The United States military hasn't done well
with counterinsurgency, which always involves political as well as
military conflict, and it would do well to stay clear of them in the
future. [Firepower, mass, maneuver, and advanced technologies---the sine
qua non of the American way of war---are not effective weapons against
lightly armed insurgents.]{.underline} Other students of recent
**[American wars see hubris as a major factor in explaining military
failure.]{.underline}** [Policymakers and generals alike have
consistently underestimated their enemies, particularly their staying
power.]{.underline} As the political scientist Dominic Tierney quipped,
"We have the power. They have the willpower." Yet, according to an
increasingly influential chorus of foreign relations scholars and
historians such as Andrew J. Bacevich, Barry Posen, and Stephen Walt[,
the fundamental problem lies not in the military itself, but in the
realm of American politics and grand strategy]{.underline}. **[One
administration after another has engaged in imperial overreach, trying
to reshape societies and entire regions of the world about which,
despite the vast intelligence assets they command, they remain
fundamentally ignorant.]{.underline}** After the catastrophe in Vietnam,
the military and [the foreign policy establishment were determined to
stay clear of foreign entanglements where America's vital interests were
not clearly at stake.]{.underline} According to the Weinberger
Doctrine---named for Ronald Reagan's secretary of state, Caspar
Weinberger---the U.S. military should only be deployed when policymakers
could define clear and attainable objectives, and only as a last resort.
As these scholars see it, the Weinberger doctrine went into sharp
decline after the Gulf War and vanished into thin air with the arrival
of the global War on Terror. Since the early '90s, [one president after
another, Republican and Democrat, has pursued an overly militarized
foreign policy agenda, deploying forces instead of seeking solutions
through the country's other instruments of influence: diplomacy, soft
power, and economic incentives.]{.underline} This new creed of military
interventionism began in the aftermath of the "stunning" victory in the
Gulf War. It was hubristic and idealistic at the same time, and drew on
a tradition of American exceptionalism as old as Puritan John Winthrop's
"City upon a Hill" sermon of 1630. Americans were a unique people, with
a special role to play in world affairs. A cadre of prominent
neoconservatives, spearheaded by Robert Kagan, Charles Krauthammer, and
William Kristol, spread [the gospel of U.S. military intervention as a
kind of panacea for all sorts of international problems and
crises.]{.underline} "Military strength alone will not avail,\"
counseled Kagan, "if we do not use it actively to maintain a world which
both supports and rests on American hegemony." "The Trump administration
is carrying out more military operations than its predecessor, against a
wider array of adversaries, with looser rules of engagement." Just after
victory in the Persian Gulf in March 1991, a very wise MIT foreign
relations expert named Barry Posen had cautioned foreign policy
decision-makers, "Don't get the idea it will always be this easy. [The
terrain was favorable to our high-tech weapons, and we were up against a
second-rate gangster. We must not confuse what we did here with using
military power to redirect the domestic politics of a
society."]{.underline} Posen's warning fell on deaf ears in Washington.
Even presidents who've promised to act with restraint in foreign affairs
have fallen prey too often to the allure of wielding the Big Stick.
["The Obama approach to national security preserved far more than it
changed]{.underline}," writes Bacevich, "and much of what it was
preserving was deeply problematic." Shortly after taking office, Obama
committed an additional 17,000 troops to Afghanistan, [expanded the war
on terror to new theaters, and increased the use of drone strikes in the
Middle East and Africa.]{.underline} Donald Trump vowed to get America
out of the nation-building business during the presidential campaign,
but in practice, according to policy experts Robert Malley and John
Finer (among others), the Trump administration is carrying out more
military operations than its predecessor, against a wider array of
adversaries, with looser rules of engagement. "American presidents since
George H. W. Bush have routinely neglected the wisdom of former
secretary of defense William Perry, who once said \'We field an army,
not a Salvation Army.\'" "[Washington has become addicted to quick
military fixes," write Malley and Finer in a recent essay in Foreign
Affairs. "Sometimes what's needed is a far broader approach that would
entail]{.underline}, where possible, engaging \[adversaries\] in
dialogue and addressing factors such as a lack of education or
employment opportunities, ethnic or religious discrimination, the
absence of state services, and local government repression. These
problems are hard to assess and require political, as opposed to
military, solutions---diplomacy rather than warfare." In short, American
presidents since George H. W. Bush have routinely neglected the wisdom
of former secretary of defense William Perry, who once said "We field an
army, not a Salvation Army." Andrew Bacevich joins noted journalist
James Fallows in believing the yawning gap between the American military
and the general public---only 1 percent of whom have served in the
military---has given interventionists in Washington essentially free
reign to commit the military to one misconceived operation after
another. A few years ago, Fallows published a long, influential article
in The Atlantic, "The Tragedy of the American Military," in which he
argued that while Americans have a deep and abiding respect for the
military as an institution, they have become utterly indifferent to what
it does in their name all around the world. Americans, he writes, are
"reverent but disengaged." It's hard to dispute his point. How many
Americans closely follow what their military is up to out there in the
wider world? Very few, surely. Professor Bacevich, I'm sure, would
agree. As he writes in The New American Militarism, "a people untouched
by war are far less likely to care about it. Persuaded that they have no
skin in the game, \[the American people\] will permit the state to do
whatever it wishes to." **[Bacevich believes the professional military
no longer belongs to the American people, but to a national security
establishment that deploys it too often, in the wrong places, at the
wrong times.]{.underline}** The American people, he says, need to
reclaim ownership of their military if they want to get out of the
permanent war rut. To do so, they must revive the citizen-soldier
tradition. If more Americans were tied to the military through their own
experiences or those of close family members, Washington would doubtless
be forced to defend its inclination to deploy armed force much more
cogently than it has done over the past few decades. Many veterans
agree. Seth Moulton, the Massachusetts congressman, democratic candidate
for president, and Marine veteran of Iraq, has said that if more people
in Congress had close connections to the military in 2003, the Iraq War
probably never would have happened. Admiral Mike Mullen, former head of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Obama administration, thinks the size
of the full-time military should be significantly reduced, so that in a
national crisis, the reserves would have to be called up. "That would
bring America in. America hasn't been involved in these previous wars
\[i.e., Afghanistan and Iraq\]. And we are paying dearly for that.

[The end of America's unchallenged global economic dominance has arrived
sooner than expected, thanks to]{.underline} the very same
[Neocons]{.underline} who gave the world the Iraq, Syria and the dirty
wars in Latin America. Just as the Vietnam War drove the [United
States]{.underline} off gold by 1971, its [violent regime change warfare
against Venezuela and Syria -- and threatening other countries with
sanctions if they do not join]{.underline} this crusade **[-- is driving
European and other nations to create their alternative financial
institutions.]{.underline}** This break has been building for quite some
time, and was bound to occur. But who would have thought that [Donald
Trump would become the catalytic agent]{.underline}? No left-wing party,
no socialist, anarchist or foreign nationalist leader anywhere in the
world could have achieved what he is doing to break up the American
Empire. The Deep State is reacting with shock at how this right-wing
real estate grifter has been able to drive other countries to defend
themselves by dismantling the U.S.-centered world order. To rub it in,
[he is using Bush and Reagan-era Neocon arsonists, John Bolton and now
Elliott Abrams, to fan the flames in Venezuela]{.underline}. It is
almost like a black political comedy. [The world of international
diplomacy is being turned inside-out]{.underline}. A world where there
is no longer even a pretense that we might adhere to international
norms, let alone laws or treaties. The **[Neocons who Trump has
appointed are accomplishing]{.underline}** **[what seemed
unthinkable]{.underline}** not long ago[: Driving China and Russia
together]{.underline} -- the great nightmare of Henry Kissinger and
Zbigniew Brzezinski. They also are [driving Germany and other European
countries into the Eurasian orbit]{.underline}, the "Heartland"
nightmare of Halford Mackinder a century ago. The root cause is clear:
[After the crescendo of pretenses and deceptions over Iraq, Libya and
Syria, along with our absolution of the lawless regime of Saudi Arabia,
foreign political leaders are coming to recognize]{.underline} what
world-wide public opinion polls reported even before the
Iraq/Iran-Contra boys turned their attention to the world's largest oil
reserves in Venezuela: **[The United States is now the greatest threat
to peace on the planet.]{.underline}** Calling the U.S. coup being
sponsored in Venezuela a defense of democracy reveals the Doublethink
underlying [U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. It defines "[democracy" to
mean supporting U.S. foreign policy, pursuing neoliberal privatization
of public infrastructure]{.underline}, [dismantling government
regulation and following the direction of U.S.-dominated global
institutions, from the IMF and World Bank to NATO]{.underline}. For
decades, **[the resulting foreign wars, domestic austerity programs and
military interventions have brought more violence, not
democracy.]{.underline}** In the Devil's Dictionary that U.S. diplomats
are taught to use as their "Elements of Style" guidelines for
Doublethink, a "democratic" country is one that follows U.S. leadership
and opens its economy to U.S. investment, and IMF- and World
Bank-sponsored privatization. [The Ukraine is deemed democratic, along
with Saudi Arabia, Israel and other countries that act as U.S. financial
and military protectorates and are willing to treat America's enemies
are theirs too.]{.underline} A point had to come where this policy
collided with the self-interest of other nations, finally breaking
through the public relations rhetoric of empire. [Other countries are
proceeding to de-dollarize and replace what U.S. diplomacy calls
"internationalism" (meaning U.S. nationalism imposed on the rest of the
world]{.underline}) with their own national self-interest. This
trajectory could be seen 50 years ago (I described it in Super
Imperialism \[1972\] and Global Fracture \[1978\].) It had to happen.
But nobody thought that the end would come in quite the way that is
happening. History has turned into comedy, or at least irony as its
dialectical path unfolds.

[At the recent Helsinki summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin,
the U.S. president used the threat of nuclear war to justify good
relations]{.underline} with a bad regime, just as he did in Singapore.
[His rhetoric included overzealous articulations]{.underline} about how
the United States and Russia control more than 90 per cent of the
world's nuclear weapons, demonstrating his penchant for hard power
capabilities. [Trump has used America's material resources to back up
his threats to NAFTA, NATO, the United Nations and the World Trade
Organization,]{.underline} textbook examples of the use of what's known
as hard power. **[His approach to wielding influence completely ignores
soft power]{.underline}**, which refers to the non-material assets a
state can harness to gain influence, including its culture, policies and
political values. Unlike its coercive counterpart, soft power rests on a
state's diplomatic capability to shape others' preferences and the
ability to get others to want to do what you want them to do. **[But if
Trump believes hard power is all that matters]{.underline}**, then how
can he explain his lack of regard for Chinese-American relations? And
[**how can we understand mounting concern for the drop in America's soft
power?** Trump's meeting with Putin shows]{.underline} just
[how]{.underline} much [soft power matters]{.underline}: It might matter
[enough]{.underline}, in fact, [to reconfigure the entire power
structure of the global political system]{.underline}. Read more: Casino
Diplomacy: The Trump game that everyone loses Trump increased the 2018

its budget for the first time in two decades, to US\$66.3 billion[.
Despite its hard power disadvantage, Russia seems nonetheless to have a
lot of influence over the U.S.]{.underline} Does this mean that Russia
has a soft power advantage over the U.S.? No. [What the Helsinki summit
and Trump-Putin relations shows us, more broadly, is the erosion of
America's soft power capabilities.]{.underline} No longer a coherent
U.S. identity [Research shows a]{.underline} reordering of the global
soft power roster, which captures the [U.S. fall from the
ranks]{.underline}. However, we know much less about how the Trump
administration is weakening U.S. soft power. [One explanation comes from
the nuances of the concept of soft power. **In short, inconsistency
erodes soft power**]{.underline}**.** [The U.S. no longer projects a
coherent identity to the international community]{.underline}, which is
how its soft power has diminished. **[Conflict between political
parties, division within civil society, and changing domestic and
foreign policies have eroded the image of the U.S.]{.underline}** as an
internally and externally consistent and united country. Trump's
openness to have Russian investigators question U.S. officials counters
the indictment of Russian gun rights activist, Maria Butina, charged
with conspiracy against the U.S. by the Department of Justice and FBI,
for example. And **[Trump himself is inconsistent]{.underline}**: [He
switched his position on the urgency and timeliness of North Korea's
denuclearization, from "immediately" to "no time limit."]{.underline}
There are many other examples of these paradoxes. How countries use soft
power Simply put, it's what a state does with its own soft power and
what other states do with it that matters. Having soft power means
nothing if it's not used or accepted by others. Consider soft power as a
starting point, a necessary but not wholly sufficient condition for
influence. Hosting the 2018 World Cup, Russia sought to exercise its
soft power on the world stage and acquire some influence in the process.
But soft power is not self-determined. Russian President Vladimir Putin,
French President Emmanuel Macron and Croatian President Kolinda
Grabar-Kitarovic at the World Cup in Moscow in July. (AP Photo/Martin
Meissner) [By using soft power, a state can gain support through
legitimacy and compliance through authority]{.underline}, which yields
influence. But for that to happen, other states need to buy into the
image that state is advancing. Based on which countries follow and are
followed, a hierarchy appears. Therefore, **[the U.S. loss of soft power
could jeopardize its ranking and level of influence in the
system]{.underline}**. [Legitimacy and authority]{.underline} operate
based on co-optation and attraction, which [links them to soft
power]{.underline}. This is also why **[reliance on hard power could be
even more damaging to the U.S.]{.underline}** China turns the tables
Lately, **[China has been quietly employing its soft
power]{.underline}**, [with the prospect of new trade relations with the
EU]{.underline} as just one example. [Soft power connotes a subtler and
gentler way of influencing other countries, which China is
displaying]{.underline}. [More relevantly, China is showing more
internal and external consistency]{.underline} in those areas that
foster soft power.

As I explain below, [the LRBIO]{.underline} actually [is the

fraying, but **Donald Trump is a symptom of this, not the

explain why the Pax Americana is under stress. Internally, [income
inequality, stagnant real incomes, the outsourcing of manufacturing jobs

class]{.underline}.5 These trends have hit the white working class
especially hard, and their effect has been amplified by rapid
demographic changes taking place in the United States. By artfully
employing 'dog whistle'6 tactics, [Trump was able to capitalize on the
concern among blue-collar voters about America's changing national

to fuel Trump's victory]{.underline}---[a triumph]{.underline} that can
be viewed as a populist backlash against globalization's effects, and
[against the elites---the 'One Percent'---who are seen to have profited
from it]{.underline}.7

Externally, [the Pax Americana is imperilled by the shifting of the
world's economic---and geopolitical---centres of gravity]{.underline}
from the Euro-Atlantic world [to Asia]{.underline}, [which presages the
end of the West's five centuries of global dominance.]{.underline} As

importantly, China]{.underline}'.8 To be precise, **[rather than Donald

relative decline of American power, and the emergence of a risen
China---that explain why the Pax Americana's days are
numbered]{.underline}**. For good measure, both the paralysing effects

economy]{.underline} that led to the Great Recession in 2008, [and the

defensive national defence policy. \"China\'s development does not pose
a threat to any country,\"]{.underline} Xi said. \"[No matter how far

chronicled at length the country\'s recent achievements, giving special
credit to former leader Deng Xiaoping, whose reforms Xi said saved China
from the brink of economic collapse following the tumultuous Cultural
Revolution. [Other celebrations of reform and opening up have been
criticized by scholars for downplaying the role of Deng, widely
considered the architect of the changes, in order to elevate
Xi.]{.underline} This time around, Xi spared no praise for Deng, as he
began by remarking on the significance of 1978 \-- the year Deng
implemented his first reforms. During the ceremony, 100 individuals were
recognized as pioneers of reform. The eclectic slate included NBA player
Yao Ming, Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Nobel prizewinning scientist Tu
Youyou. They received their medals to the tune of \"Story of Spring,\" a
patriotic ballad paying tribute to Deng. Throughout, Xi emphasized the
absolute rule of the Communist Party and its upholding of Chinese
sovereignty. [\"No one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people
what should or should not be don]{.underline}e,\" he said. \"[We will
resolutely reform what can and needs to be reformed, and we will
resolutely uphold what cannot and does not need to be

Harvard, \"[the distinctiveness and absolute correctness of China\'s
path under the party\'s leadership.\"]{.underline} \"**[This was a broad
attempt to provide a really positive, confidence-building story of
China\'s past 40 years and its future]{.underline}**,\" said Gewirtz,
who has written a book about China\'s economic reforms. [The address
won\'t assuage concerned private entrepreneurs and foreign businesses,
who had hoped Xi would use the occasion to announce concrete
industry-opening measures to shift dominance away from state
corporations.]{.underline} China\'s push to dominate the high-tech
industry by 2025 is a sore point with Washington and a contributing
factor in trade tensions that have seen the world\'s two largest
economies slap billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each other\'s
products this year. In a move welcomed by global stock markets,
President Donald Trump agreed Dec. 1 to postpone more U.S. tariff hikes

[It is often said that the US and China]{.underline} -- superpowers at
economic, geopolitical, and ideological loggerheads -- [are heading
toward a new cold war]{.underline}. And the rhetoric -- at least from
one side -- has come to resemble that of Winston Churchill's 1946 "Iron
Curtain" speech, one of the inaugural events of the Cold War. Just this
month, [US Vice President Mike Pence accused China of predatory economic
practices, military aggression]{.underline} against the United States,
[and attempts to undermine]{.underline} US President Donald
[Trump]{.underline}. But **[despite the media hype, a new cold war is
not inevitable]{.underline}** **[-- or even likely]{.underline}**. [To
be sure, Chinese leaders]{.underline}, fearing disorder and any
weakening of the Communist Party of China's legitimacy, [are determined
to prevent the US from forcing changes on China's political and economic
system]{.underline}. China will continue to pursue reforms at its own
pace and in its own way. For Chinese President Xi Jinping, a top
priority is to merge the CPC with the machinery of government in order
to reduce corruption and burnish the state's ideological credentials.
Any attempt to interfere in this process would be crossing a red line.
[Fortunately for Xi, Trump has no interest in "democratizing" other
countries, and he doesn't seem]{.underline} to have been [swayed
by]{.underline} the [US investors]{.underline}, financiers, and
technology titans [who want]{.underline} his administration to press for
[more access to the Chinese economy]{.underline}. No doubt, US tariffs
threaten the 18% of Chinese exports that go to the US each year. But
[the Trump administration has more urgent priorities than changing
China's system of government]{.underline}, notwithstanding the
aggressive rhetoric of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and
White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro. [Trump
desperately wants to bolster US manufacturing]{.underline} by
repatriating global supply chains and blocking or curbing imports. "Make
America Great Again" is really about making in America again. Image:
Statista Still, even if today's US-China standoff does not evolve into a
new cold war, it could weaken both countries and usher in a more
multipolar world. Within China, US rhetorical broadsides, tariffs, and
sanctions may be empowering Xi's domestic critics. And it doesn't help
that China currently has limited options for retaliating. True, it could
start to sell off some of its \$1 trillion in US dollar reserves. But
that would weaken the value of the US Treasuries that it continues to
hold. Within the US, [Trump's decision to pursue sweeping import tariffs
has been described]{.underline} by one industry representative [as "the
most self-destructive trade act I've ever seen]{.underline}." And [the
administration's renegotiation of]{.underline} the [N]{.underline}orth
[A]{.underline}merican [F]{.underline}ree [T]{.underline}rade
[A]{.underline}greement -- which includes a clause to prevent Canada or
Mexico from negotiating with China -- [has met with similar
disdain]{.underline}. [Such policies threaten]{.underline} both to
destroy US jobs and [to alienate America's allies,]{.underline} many of
which are already distancing themselves. Indeed, **[the Trump
administration's "America First" positions have increasingly translated
into "America Alone."]{.underline}** The US now constitutes a minority
of one within the G7, the G20, and the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change. After Trump pulled the US out of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the remaining parties moved ahead on
their own. Far from setting the terms of debate on international issues,
**[the Trump administration has convinced other countries to reduce
their reliance on US leadership.]{.underline}** Widespread
**[circumvention of the US will hasten the emergence of a new multipolar
order]{.underline}**. For example, by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear
deal, Trump has essentially dared the United Kingdom, France, Germany,
China, Russia, and the European Union to defy US prerogatives. [For now,
countries that rely on Iranian oil may have no choice but to go along
with the US]{.underline}. Like most traded goods, oil exports are paid
for in dollars -- largely through the Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) in Belgium -- and the US has the
power to shut down such transactions. Most companies and countries have
concluded that doing business in Iran is not worth losing access to the
US market and the international dollar-payments system. Have you read?
US-China trade war: top quotes from the World Economic Forum in China
The US needs China as an innovation partner. Here\'s why What a US-China
trade war could mean for the world But [in the future, they may no
longer have to make such tradeoffs]{.underline}. On August 21,
[Germany's]{.underline} [foreign minister]{.underline}, Heiko Maas,
[urged Europe to establish payment channels that are independent of the
US.]{.underline} And the following month, the EU's foreign policy chief
announced plans to form a "special purpose vehicle" to "assist and
reassure economic operators pursuing legitimate business with Iran."
Meanwhile, [Russia]{.underline} has said that it [is developing its own
system for financial transfers,]{.underline} to protect itself from
being shut out of the SWIFT system in the event of harsher US sanctions.
And [China has been pursuing a similar project]{.underline} at least
since 2015, when the People's Bank of China launched a system to
facilitate cross-border transactions in renminbi. None of these
alternative systems have yet to match the convenience of SWIFT and the
dollar system. But [if a new system were to take hold, it could rapidly
shift power away from the US. **Rather than a cold war, the world may be
heading toward an international system led by four
powers**]{.underline}, **[with the US, China, Russia, and Germany
dominating their respective regions]{.underline}** and seeking the upper
hand in international negotiations. Such a scenario is reminiscent of
the World War II vision of US President Franklin D.
[Roosevelt]{.underline}, who [proposed that the four victorious
allies]{.underline} -- the US, the UK, China, and the Soviet Union [--
act as "Four Policemen," each patrolling its own sphere of influence and
negotiating with the others on world peace]{.underline}. Image: Frank O.
Salisbury via Wikimedia Commons Today, [approximations of the same four
powers are once again in the lead]{.underline}, [only]{.underline} [now
we have stronger international institutions to help keep the
peace]{.underline}. Whether that peace lasts will depend on the
willingness of the four powers to use and adapt those institutions to
the emerging international system.

### 1NC -- Climate -- Defense

#### They have it backwards, climate change will [kill]{.underline} American primacy -- economic costs of adaptation & global disorder

of international relations at Harvard University, "Global Warming Is
Setting Fire to American Leadership," 12/3/2018,

sg

U.S. President Donald **[Trump has said, "I don't believe" climate
change is real. Guess what? The global environment doesn't
care.]{.underline}** The condition of the planet will be determined by
the laws of physics and chemistry, not by Trump's tweets, denials,
bluster, or relentlessly head-in-the-sand approach to a rapidly warming
planet. [Trump will no longer be with us by the time the worst effects
are realized]{.underline}, of course; **[it is future generations who
will suffer the consequences.]{.underline}** And make no mistake: Those
consequences are going to significant. As reported over Thanksgiving
weekend, [the latest U.S. government "National Climate Assessment"
report makes it]{.underline} abundantly [clear that]{.underline} [rising
average temperatures are going to have far-reaching and damaging
effects.]{.underline} The report was a collaborative effort by 13
federal agencies, and it offers a sobering portrait of our likely
future. [Storms will be more intense and dangerous. Agricultural
productivity will decline]{.underline}. [Certain diseases and pests will
be more numerous]{.underline} and bothersome, and [heat-related deaths
will increase significantly]{.underline}. Trump may not believe it, but
what he does or does not believe is irrelevant, except as it affects
what we do (or don't do) today and thus how serious the problem is down
the road. [The direct consequences of climate change]{.underline} will
be harmful enough---even if we respond to them more energetically than
we have to date---but I believe it [will also have profound effects on
U.S. foreign policy.]{.underline} Some of the consequences have already
been catalogued---including in a landmark U.S. Defense Department study
in 2015---but the long-term impact could be even more far-reaching. To
be deliberately provocative: [**Climate change could do more to limit
America's global ambitions** than all the books, articles, op-eds, and
other advocacy undertaken by apostles of restraint]{.underline}. **[Why?
Because adapting to a warmer planet is going to be really
expensive.]{.underline}** For starters, [climate change is already
having an impact on military facilities in the United
States]{.underline} [and will force the]{.underline} Department
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense [to undertake costly remedial
measures.]{.underline} [Hurricane Michael caused millions of dollars of
destruction]{.underline} at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida this fall
(including damage to some of the costly F-22s stationed there), and the
vast U.S. naval shipyard at Newport News is already prone to flooding
and will require costly adaptive actions if it is to remain operational
as sea levels rise. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists[, a
three-foot increase in sea levels]{.underline} (which is well within the
range of current estimates), [could jeopardize the use of 128 U.S.
military bases]{.underline}. [Protecting these facilities]{.underline}
or building new ones [will not be cheap]{.underline}, [and the money
spent on these]{.underline} measures is money that [cannot be spent on
force structure, personnel, or overseas contingency
operations.]{.underline} Second, as noted above, [climate change will
impose significant costs on the U.S. economy]{.underline}. According to
the recent National Climate Assessment, the [costs associated with
climate change could reduce U.S. GDP by]{.underline} as much as [10
percent]{.underline} by the end of the century. ([That's]{.underline}
roughly [twice the impact of the 2008 recession]{.underline}, by the
way.) The United States will still be a relatively wealthy country, of
course, but not as rich as it would be otherwise. [Third, adapting to
climate change won't be cheap either]{.underline}. [Low-lying areas are
going to need]{.underline} dikes, seawalls, storm sewers, and other
[major infrastructure investments.]{.underline} [Some densely populated
areas may have to be abandoned]{.underline}, [which means]{.underline}
the need for [new housing for tens of thousands of people]{.underline}
(if not more). [Power grids will have to be strengthened]{.underline} or
replaced, while [bridges and causeways will need to be
elevated]{.underline}. No one knows precisely what all this will cost,
but consider that the climate change adaptation plan proposed by
then-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg after Hurricane Sandy hit in
2013 was budgeted at \$20 billion. It probably wasn't ambitious enough,
the true costs would probably be higher, and that's just one city
(albeit a big and important one). To be sure, some of this new
infrastructure would need to be built anyway, even if the planet wasn't
getting warmer and sea levels weren't rising. And spending on
infrastructure can boost productivity and provide lots of
lower-to-middle-class employment. Even so, **[the full cost of adapting
to the environment of the late 21st century easily runs into hundreds of
billions of dollars over the next few decades.]{.underline}** So [we are
facing a potential double whammy]{.underline}: **[Climate change will
reduce economic growth in various ways]{.underline}, [even as we need to
spend a lot of money trying to adapt to its
effects]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} This problem might not be too
serious if [the United States]{.underline} had a big sovereign wealth
fund, or if the government were running recurring budget surpluses that
could be used to pay for these costs. But the opposite is true: It [has
a ballooning budget deficit and level of public debt, and recurring
political gridlock has turned the budget process into an annual exercise
in political posturing]{.underline} and brinkmanship. My point, in
short, is that the [costs of adapting to climate change are going to put
enormous pressure on an already squeezed federal budget]{.underline},
and [at a time when the U.S. population is getting older, health care
costs are rising, and tax cuts have become the norm]{.underline}. My
question, therefore, is simple: [Where's the money going to come
from?]{.underline} If this scenario is even partially true, then
**[maintaining a defense budget and a national security establishment
that dwarfs those of all other states is going to be]{.underline}**
increasingly difficult if not **[politically impossible]{.underline}**.
**[Persuading the American people to fund wars of choice]{.underline}**,
**[to protect distant allies of questionable strategic value, or even to
wage far-flung counterterrorism operations is going to be a hard
sell]{.underline}**. The foreign-policy "Blob" may continue to resist a
strategy of restraint, but fiscal realities may gradually impose one on
it anyway. The good news, such as it is, is that climate change will
affect a lot of other countries even more than it affects the United
States, and many of them are even less prepared to deal with the
consequences. So America's relative position may not be affected all
that much. But that "good news" isn't really positive, because [climate
change is also likely to exacerbate **civil and regional conflicts** and
is virtually certain to trigger **complex humanitarian crises, refugee
flows, and other forms of global disorder.**]{.underline}

Today, the 24th conference of parties gathering -- or COP 24 -- of the
UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has begun to conclude. As the
biggest climate change meeting since the signing of the Paris Agreement,
this is a significant moment in history, and one worth reflecting on,
particularly as United States leadership continues to recede on this
critical global issue. In no uncertain terms, climate change is among
the greatest international challenges of our time. It has truly
strategic implications for the United States and its allies, and its
effects and manifestations are rising in intensity and urgency by the
day. The economic, social and security effects of a rapidly changing
climate will be dramatic, and in managing this problem and mitigating
its effects, the United States must showcase strong, dedicated
leadership as the community of nations works towards credible and
lasting solutions. Yet, **[what does "leadership" really mean for an
issue as all-encompassing and international]{.underline}** in nature
**[as climate change]{.underline}**? Increasingly, and especially here
**[in the U.S.]{.underline}**, **[there's developed an important
distinction between]{.underline}** the **[leadership]{.underline}** that
can be provided **[by]{.underline}** a president or **[the federal
government]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** the wider values-based
leadership that a country can deliver on major issues through the
actions and efforts of **[businesses, state and local government, NGOs,
and every-day citizens]{.underline}**. Climate change is a leading
example of this: where, through the collective leadership of "everyone
else," the United States is continuing to act as a force for meaningful
change despite the retrogressive thinking and recalcitrant behavior of
the current Administration on this issue. That's what I call "American
leadership" -- or, leadership defined by the **[values and
norms]{.underline}** that have made America the greatest nation on the
planet these many decades. And it **[doesn't require the U.S.
government]{.underline}**, **[or]{.underline}**, "**[U.S.
leadership]{.underline}**," **[to be effective.]{.underline}** On
climate change, U.S. leadership has been intermittent at best. President
H.W. Bush and President Clinton both deeply embraced the climate
challenge, before President George W. Bush famously walked away from the
Kyoto Protocols in 2001. Towards the end of his Presidency, though,
President Bush took important steps to generate international climate
action, most importantly through the creation of what was then known as
the Major Emitters Forum (now the Major Economies Forum) -- a collection
of the most important economies in the world. President Obama used this
group to generate the first important steps towards what later became
the Paris Climate Agreement. President Trump has reversed course,
deciding that the United States will withdraw from the agreement in 2020
(absent major and highly unlikely re-negotiations). As **[the global
community gathered at the COP 24 climate summit]{.underline}**, **[a
meeting Brookings scholars]{.underline}** such **[as Todd
Stern]{.underline}**, **[David Victor and Samantha Gross]{.underline}**
have **[tracked extensively]{.underline}**, and **[something the current
Administration has chosen to marginalize]{.underline}**, this most
recent shift in U.S. leadership is deeply troubling, both for the nation
and the world. This doesn't mean, however, that the U.S. is now
irrelevant to the problem; in fact, it's essential -- and this is where
American leadership comes in. Though the absence of U.S. governmental
leadership from climate change is deeply regrettable and the U.S. is, in
fact, most impactful when its two forms of leadership are harmonized,
it's not the same as saying that America is entirely absent from the
picture. American carbon emissions have, in fact, declined steadily over
the last several years. Indeed, America is the sixth fastest declining
emitter in the world, ahead of countries like Germany, Canada and Japan.
That's less because of governmental action than it is because of
American leadership at work, to include the dynamism of the American
private sector, the actions taken by city and state leaders, and the
engaged efforts of philanthropies and civil society, as well as
universities and think tanks. These groups represent the bedrock of
American values and exceptionalism, and it's through them that America
continues to lead in spite of the actions of current U.S. political
leadership. Despite its abdication of leadership on climate change, the
Trump Administration's desire to claim any win as their own is resulting
in senior officials trying and failing to claim credit for these limited
successes from their fellow Americans. Recent Administration claims
linking their decision on Paris to substantial carbon reduction
successes are, in fact, specious. Indeed, the success in U.S. carbon
reductions came explicitly from the momentum of the Obama and previous
administrations' efforts and continued subnational efforts. Put
differently, **[U.S. carbon reductions have occurred despite
the]{.underline}** current **[Administration]{.underline}**, not because
of it. And this, of course, says nothing about Trump Administration
efforts to actively downplay key international climate reports, as well
as those generated by the U.S. government itself.

### 1NC -- Climate -- China Turn

#### Chinese hegemony is key to avert extinction due to climate change -- Chinese climate leadership is [significantly]{.underline} better than Trump's 

**Ballard 19** \[Eden Ballard, staff writer @ the UCLA International
Institute, "Climate Change and Economic Hegemony," 4/29/19,

Since the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s, [the world has
already warmed by one degree Celsius]{.underline} and human activity
continues to raise average global temperatures. [Every
degree]{.underline} above pre-anthropocene levels [has dire consequences
that are felt around the world]{.underline}. [A report by
the]{.underline} United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change ([IPCC]{.underline})1 released in October of 2018, which
corroborated 6,000 independent studies on the issue, [confirmed that
climate change demands immediate global attention.]{.underline} The
scientific community agrees that **[left unchecked, the temperature will
continue to rise and lead to increasingly frequent climate-related
catastrophes.]{.underline}** A special coverage article by The New York
Times, "Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change"2,
outlines the increasing levels of irreparable destruction prescribed
with each degree the climate warms. [An increase as small as two degrees
means **the extinction of the world's tropical reefs, sea-level rise of
several meters and the forced abandonment of the Persian Gulf** due to
uninhabitable temperatures.]{.underline} The consequences of each degree
are increasingly severe until ultimately, **[at five degrees, scientists
warn about the end of human civilization.]{.underline}** With so much at
stake, [it is vital that the international community take
action]{.underline}. The Paris Agreement3, a multilateral agreement
facilitated by the United Nations that focuses on actions that can be
taken to mitigate the effects of climate change, was signed by 175
nations4 on Earth day in 2016. Although it is one of the most
comprehensive attempts at combating climate change to date, [the Paris
Agreement was designed to function primarily through the promotion of
voluntary action]{.underline} by individual nations. It is not difficult
to imagine then, that [some countries]{.underline} have
[chose]{.underline}n [not to take action]{.underline} [as their
economies are closely tied with]{.underline} some of the
[practices]{.underline} [that are most responsible for
pollution]{.underline}. Among them is the United States. President
Donald [Trump justified abandoning the agreement5 because
of]{.underline} the "draconian financial and [economic
burdens]{.underline} the agreement imposes on our country." Part of
Trump's campaign platform was rooted in protecting the jobs in the coal
industry and a buzzword for him became "clean coal"6 meaning an effort
to reduce pollution as a result of coal production. [This short-sighted
vision overlooks the fact that]{.underline} attempting to limit the
environmental effects of coal is largely ineffective and equally as
expensive as [investing in alternative energy sources]{.underline} which
[would help the US be a leader in climate activism.]{.underline} The
World Bank emphasizes that when it comes to climate change, "[the costs
of inaction are far higher]{.underline}"7 than those associated with
investing in positive change. **[Where the US is stepping down, China is
stepping up.]{.underline}** One reason [China is motivated to take
action]{.underline} when the US is not lies in the fact that
[China]{.underline}, [infamous for its unbreathable air, has already
paid dearly for its dependency on coal]{.underline}. The International
Energy Agency in Paris reports that fossil fuel emissions in China have
close to tripled since 2000. This is mainly a reflection of China's
large population as per person emissions are lower than those in the US.
[In 2009, 16 of the world's 20 most polluted cities8 were in
China.]{.underline} [Today]{.underline} [only the bottom four cities on
the top 20 list are in China]{.underline} because [the government has
been investing in sustainable technology such as electric cars, wind and
solar energy, as well as implementing emission reducing
legislation.]{.underline} In 2013 and 2014, [the Chinese government
encouraged several pilot cap and trade programs]{.underline} that
generated close to \$680 million in the 2017 fiscal year. In December of
2017 China announced a new plan9 for an even more comprehensive
nationwide market focusing on their power generation sector to trade
emissions credits that allow businesses to buy and sell the credits that
allow them to emit planet-warming greenhouse gases. [Cap and trade
programs10]{.underline} [are one of the most talked about ways to combat
climate change using the free market]{.underline}. They incentivize
business that use clean energy by limiting the total amount of emissions
allowed to all companies and then allowing those that have not used all
of the emissions they are allotted to sell them to companies that
continue to pollute. Hypothetically, [this incentivizes companies to go
green by ensuring that eco-friendly policies save them
money.]{.underline} The challenge with a cap and trade program is
closing the loopholes so that heavy polluters cannot skirt around the
issue and do, in fact, take initiative to limit emissions. Though there
is room for some refinement, [**the existing measures are indicative of
China's awareness and sense of urgency around the issue of climate
change.** China's shift away from coal is not only environmentally
responsible, it is also economically shrewd]{.underline} as **[they
are]{.underline}** setting themselves up for financial success for
decades to come and **[effectively leaving the United States to wallow
in what remains of their 20th century glory]{.underline}**. **[The
W]{.underline}**orld **[H]{.underline}**ealth
**[O]{.underline}**rganization [has acknowledged China's efforts in
curbing pollution and **hopes that other nations will take a cue from
their actions**]{.underline}. In order to stay economically relevant,
nations need to invest in sustainable energy sources. The Visual
Capitalist cites the "the Green Revolution" as one of the 8 major forces
shaping the future11 of the global economy as well as the fact that by
2040, a total of \$10.2 trillion will be invested in new power
generation capacity worldwide. [Nations that chose to live in denial of
their impact on climate change are also in denial of the fact that they
are simultaneously becoming relics from a pre-climate change
era.]{.underline} **[It's time for nations around the world to follow
China's lead]{.underline}** and start thinking about negative
externalities regardless of the scale of the project; inaction only
exacerbates the issue. [Each day is an opportunity for nations to
redefine themselves and prepare for the future]{.underline}. As there
are no binding international climate treaties already in existence, we
don't have the privilege of taking the time to reach a global agreement
on what actions should be taken. [**Individual nation states must act
rapidly and prudently to lead the charge** by investing in sustainable
practices]{.underline} [by being practical and responsible inhabitants
of Earth]{.underline} in order to both prevent further environmental
damage and stay economically relevant.

[Trump seems to have understood the message coming from Beijing and
Moscow regarding the inviolability of their territory, their spheres of
influence and their sovereignty]{.underline}. For this reason,
Washington\'s aggression seems to be focussing more on the economic
arena. **[Trump has weaponized the dollar and is wielding it against
allies and enemies alike to extract benefits for the United
States]{.underline}**. [What the current administration intends to do is
use the status of the dollar (already a reserve currency and the medium
of exchange for such things as oil) as a weapon]{.underline} against
adversaries and allies. And it is painful for those at the receiving
end, given that the global economy revolves around Washington and the
dollar. The ability to bar European companies from operating in Iran
derives from the status of the petrodollar. Washington forbids foreign
banks from working with Iranian banks, effectively blocking the flow of
US dollars into the country. This is aside from excluding targets from
the SWIFT banking network. To understand the consequences of these
actions, it is important to note how presidents prior to Trump worked to
advance American imperialism. As noted, following the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan, several countries began to anticipate and plan against
scenarios of American aggression. [Alliances have been strengthened
(Pakistan with China, India with Russia, Qatar with Turkey, Iran with
Russia and China, Iran with Russia and Turkey),]{.underline} many issues
are being slowly resolved (India and Pakistan, South Korea and North
Korea) [and many countries prefer to buy arms from Russia and China in
order to keep American imperialism at bay. The methodology of color
revolutions, in]{.underline} the [light of the protection]{.underline}
now [being offered by]{.underline} the likes of [Russia and Iran, was
employed in the place of direct military intervention]{.underline} (as
occurred in Iraq and Afghanistan) in other theaters (Libya, Ukraine and
Syria). After the wars in 2002 and 2003 in Iraq and Afghanistan, [China,
Russia and Iran drew a red line regarding Washington\'s
interventionism.]{.underline} The effectiveness of color revolutions was
diminished when the Russians, the Chinese and Iranians started expelling
the various NGOs funded by the likes of Soros and other globalist
financiers to bring about regime change under the cover of democracy and
human rights. **[The outlook of Washington\'s political establishment is
based on military hard power that is now inferior in offensive
capability than the Sino-Russo-Iranian one, ensuring the strategic
independence of Eurasia and its partners]{.underline}** (Turkey, India,
Qatar, Pakistan, Lebanon, Syria, Libya, Egypt, the Philippines, etc.).
In terms of color revolutions, the artifice has now been brought to
light, and [countries on the receiving end of such attacks can now
recognize them and quickly act to forestall]{.underline} them, as
happened in Hong Kong in 2014. [Donald Trump seems to have resorted to
the only weapon left available to him, namely, the economic power of the
US dollar,]{.underline} offering him the opportunity to shape events. It
is a strategy with short-term benefits by devastating effects for
Washington in the long run. Indeed, [the only way to combat US financial
dominance is to ditch the US dollar for other currencies.]{.underline}
Washington\'s economic [power derives from the use that the world makes
of the dollar.]{.underline} Clearly, then, **[Trump\'s decision to use
the US dollar as a weapon will cost his country dearly in the future,
the dollar probably bound to lose its role as a global reserve
currency.]{.underline}** As history has shown, [when a reserve currency
is transferred to another currency, the empire that depended on this
reserve-currency status itself went into decline.]{.underline} [This
occurred with the France and Britain, and it will likely occur with the
United States.]{.underline} [If the S-400 militarily represents the
middle finger to Washington]{.underline}, denying as it does US air
dominance**[, de-dollarization is the obvious answer to Trump's use of
the US dollar as a weapon to wield against friends and
enemies.]{.underline}** This vulnerability is a wake-up call for US
allies, who have filled their pockets and state coffers with US dollars
printed at zero interest rates. Just look at the situation in Turkey,
with almost 100 billion dollars in foreign debt. Ankara suffers from the
excessive dollarization of its economy. It thus remains vulnerable to a
US dollar attack by Trump, and without Qatar coming to the rescue with
15 billion dollars worth of investment, the Turkish lira would have not
been able to resist for much longer. The danger of an economic collapse
is real, along the same lines as was experienced in Asia in the late
1990s through devastating financial-speculation attacks. In [contrast,
Moscow finds itself with a very low public debt and just 13 billion in
dollar-denominated securities, continuing apace the de-dollarization of
its economy. **Trump has indirectly set in motion a much needed global
rebalancing.**]{.underline} Washington's downsizing into a smaller power
will come about above all through a fundamental change at the global
economic level. As long as Washington is free to print money, increase
debt, exchange dollars for real goods, and remain credible to the rest
of the world that continues to purchase US treasuries instead of gold as
a safe haven, Trump will be free to use the US dollar as a baseball bat
with which he can whack friends and opponents over the head. [The
potential use of the US dollar as a baseball bat has been evident for
more than a decade for Russians, Chinese and Iranians**. For this
reason, they have been exchanging their dollars for other currencies for
years.**]{.underline} The United States, as a declining empire, is
lashing out, employing every weapon available to try and arrest its
diminishing status as the world's sole superpower. [Now it is the turn
of America's allies to relinquish the dollar, coming to understand that
real sovereignty is ensured through economic sovereignty.]{.underline}

[President Trump recently ordered more tariffs on an expanded list of
Chinese imports.]{.underline} The rate is 10[%. It will rise to
25%]{.underline} at the beginning of 2019, [unless China agrees to new
trade policies before then.]{.underline} Notably, Trump excluded
consumer electronics products like smartphones from the tariffs. That
shows he does not entirely ignore the tariff impact on U.S. consumers. I
agree with the president that China has taken unfair advantage of global
trade rules. Its demand for foreign companies to disclose intellectual
property is insane. That must stop. The question is how to accomplish
it. Foolish Foreign Policy? [I had hopes Trump's business negotiation
skills would help achieve productive trade talks. It did not happen that
way.]{.underline} Trump could have gathered a united front of other top
economies that got hurt by China's policies and then demanded China
change its ways on behalf of everyone. Only then would I have sought
better terms with Canada, Mexico, the EU and others. **[Instead, he has
turned his allies against the U.S.]{.underline}** Part of negotiating is
to have realistic demands. [You will never succeed by demanding your
adversary cut his own throat. **Xi Jinping can be flexible on many
things. Yet he still runs a Communist government and a command economy.
That leopard is not going to change its spots.** They are never going to
abandon their technology goals embodied in their "Made in China 2025"
program]{.underline}. Nor would any other country. And I am not the only
one who thinks this. Dangerous Game Now, it may be that the White House
team is less talented than it thinks. But it may also be that it has an
entirely different strategy than we think. Some of my contacts believe
[the real goal is to make U.S. businesses pull back from operating in
China at all]{.underline}. If that's the goal, they are off to a good
start. But [that is not good for U.S. businesses or for the
U.S.]{.underline} For the moment, the U.S. side is negotiating from a
marginally stronger position[. Our economy is growing nicely and can
withstand some tariff pain. It will hurt certain sectors,
though.]{.underline} This is already happening. Trump is playing a very
dangerous game in the long [run. International trade is like plumbing.
Goods and money flow around through pipes and you can only squeeze so
much through them. **When the U.S. imports goods from China, we export
dollars to China. We can do that because our currency is what everything
else is settled in. Cutting imports would mean we also slash dollar
exports. That's not good at all if we want to maintain our position on
top of the food chain.**]{.underline} I recently ran across a simple and
short explanation of this threat by currency expert Taggart Murphy.
[Trump is doing everything he can to bring on the end of the days when
the US can borrow whatever it wants]{.underline} in whatever amounts it
wants. To be sure, there is no recipe book. The dollar is now so
entrenched as the world's money that if your assignment were to bring
the curtain down on that---and thus the ability of the US to borrow
whatever it wants whenever it wants---it's not at all clear what you
would do. [But you'd start by doing everything that Trump is
doing---pick fights with all your allies, blow the government deficit
wide open at the peak of an economic recovery, abandon any notion of
fiscal responsibility]{.underline}, threaten sanctions on anyone and
everyone who seeks to honor the deal Obama struck with [Iran (thereby
almost begging everyone to figure out some way to bypass the US banking
system in order to do business]{.underline}), \[Which they are openly
doing --JFM\] [throw spanners into the works of global trade without any
clear indication of what it is precisely you want for a country that
structurally consumes more than it produces and thus by the laws of
accounting MUST run trade and current account deficits.]{.underline}
That's strong language but exactly right, especially the last part. The
End of U.S. Hegemony If this trade war continues, it will initially
favor the U.S. [But eventually, the rest of the world will build new
pipes to bypass us. Then we will lose the advantage. Something similar
happened to our predecessor hegemon, the United Kingdom.]{.underline} We
don't know what a new world financial order would look like. But [the
U.S. dollar would not be on top of it. Not with populist politics,
enormous debt, mass refugee migrations and rapid technological change
that could put millions out of work.]{.underline} Think about this
U.S.-China rivalry as a long boxing match. We'll see both sides throwing
and absorbing punches. [The lead will change often and the winner could
even be a third party that may not exist yet.]{.underline} I hope China
reduces its most abusive practices and Trump calls off the tariffs. [One
of my most inside sources in China told me he believes that to be the
case. And most Chinese do, too.]{.underline}

Taras **[Chornovil]{.underline}**, **[a Ukrainian political analyst and
foreign relations expert]{.underline}**, has **[said it is unlikely that
a nuclear war may begin between the United States and the Russian
Federation]{.underline}**, **[as Moscow is technically
weak]{.underline}**. \"Putin sees his every sortie he escapes punishment
for as a weakness of the Western world and encouragement to escalate.
Moscow has not fulfilled the terms of the agreement for a long time. It
has created missile carriers uncontrollably, equipped them with nuclear
warheads, stuffed Kaliningrad region with missiles, and now violates the
agreement on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, bringing carriers
and, obviously, warheads into occupied Crimea. This is a critical threat
to Europe, the European command of NATO and the geopolitical interests
of the United States. Of course, the threat is growing for Ukraine,\" he
said during an online Q&A session with the Ukrainian news outlet
Glavred\'s readers. According to the political analyst, **[Russia
previously had a more favorable economic climate]{.underline}**,
**[which allowed the Kremlin to secretly build up

into disintegrating. \"With one thing that is different: Soviet and
American missiles could have mutually destroyed both superpowers. And
**[now all American missiles can reach Russia]{.underline}**, **[and

Conclusion [The future of space power may not look like the past if
current trends in the commercial space sector continue]{.underline}. As
US Space Command's Gen Howell Estes predicted in 1997 as he looked ahead
in terms of space power, "**[It is not the future of military space that
is critical to the United States---it is the continued commercial
development of space that will provide continued strength for our great
country in the decades ahead."]{.underline}**75 Similarly, trying to
determine the likely relationship between the US military and commercial
space sector back in 2002, Lt Col Peter Hays commented, "[It is
currently unclear that military means are the best way to protect
commercial satellites or that the military will be called upon to build
a more robust space infrastructure based on perceived threats to
commercial systems]{.underline}."76 Since Hays wrote that passage, [the
Cold War assumption that US military assets would be needed to "protect"
commercial assets in space has been challenged even more]{.underline},
to the extent that **[it is now more common to discuss the concept of
using commercial infrastructure or allied assets to provide resilience
to what are seen as more vulnerable US military assets]{.underline}**.
If this trend continues, it may well be that [commercial capabilities
and allies will prove to be essential to sustainable space power by
providing the mission assurance needed in various areas of space
activity necessary for effective deterrence.]{.underline} Just because
the United States has a vibrant, emerging commercial space start-up
sector and strong friends and allies, however, does not mean it can
assume future US power relative to its adversaries. As Gen Jay Raymond
stated recently, "Space superiority is not a birthright; it must be
earned."7778 Indeed, a lack of investment in either dimension of
national space capability (civil or military) or ineffective policies to
engage (and draw upon) the commercial sector and allies could cause
over- [all US space power to fail to reach its potential.]{.underline}

#### Dual-use technologies in space increase the risk of conflict

[Space is a fragile and challenging environment. It is]{.underline}, by
its very nature, **[hostile to human survival]{.underline}** and yet it
has summoned the dreams and ambitions of humanity since the dawn of
time. The desire to explore and potentially to inhabit space has driven
scientific endeavour and the achievements of humans in first orbiting
the Earth (Yuri Gagarin in 1961) and then landing on the Moon (Apollo 11
in 1969) have inspired generations since that time to continue to
explore the solar system and beyond with earth and space-based
technologies. We are now poised on the edge of the next great adventure,
sending new missions to the Moon and then to Mars. However**[, space has
also been perceived as the ultimate 'high ground', a place from which
the militaries of nation states could conduct reconnaissance and
surveillance and, possibly, hostilities]{.underline}**. Early
experiments proved the [dangers of detonation of nuclear weapons in
space and, recognising the uncontrollable risk,]{.underline} the Partial
Test Ban Treaty of 1963 prohibited the explosion of nuclear weapons in
outer space. This ban was restated in the first of the UN space
treaties: the Outer Space Treaty (OST) (Treaty on Principles Governing
the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space,
including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies) in 1967. Article VI of
the OST also prohibited the 'establishment of military bases,
installations and fortifications, the testing of any types of weapons
and the conduct of military manoeuvres on celestial bodies shall be
forbidden.' However, **[the same provision also expressly acknowledged
that the 'use of military personnel for scientific research or for any
other peaceful purposes shall not be prohibited.']{.underline}** Beyond
these provisions, and the oft cited but **[operationally opaque
references to 'peaceful purposes' and to the exploration and use of
outer space as the 'province of all mankind' there are no clear
guidelines regarding military use of outer space.]{.underline}** In
addition, **[military technology and military personnel were and remain
essential to the exploration of outer space]{.underline}**. Most
astronauts and cosmonauts are still drawn from their respective
country's military forces. **[Today, militaries worldwide are dependent
upon space for surveillance, reconnaissance, communication, navigation,
and much more.]{.underline}** However, space is now becoming a
commercial domain. [Communication satellites provided the first avenue
for commercial exploitation of space in the 1970s and 80s.]{.underline}
The development of [GPS]{.underline} then [provided an opportunity for
the creation of endless consumer platforms including internet time,
navigation and entertainment.]{.underline} Internet of things
applications, deployed through constellations of cubesats, now promise
to bring new services to remote areas. More recently technology has
developed at an increasingly rapid pace. [Commercial providers such as
New Zealand based Rocket Lab are developing novel materials, fuels and
techniques which have drastically reduced the cost of access to
space]{.underline}. Governments are becoming the customers rather than
the providers of space services. [Militaries are increasingly dependent
upon commercial technology to provide services such as surveillance and
communication, as well providing technology and services to government
that would previously have been the domain of government organisations
such as NASA.]{.underline} In March 2019 Elon Musk's SpaceX successfully
docked a Dragon capsule with the International Space Station (ISS).The
capability for US crew to be launched into space from American soil had
not been possible since the cancellation of the Space Shuttle program in
2011. This had left the US reliant upon the Russian Soyuz program for
crewed flights since that time. NASA has awarded contracts to SpaceX and
Boeing with a potential value of \$6.8 billion to transport U.S.
astronauts to the ISS. Not only did the Dragon capsule carry supplies
for the ISS as part of its continued support of the NASA Commercial
Resupply Service (CRS), it also carried a mannequin, named 'Ripley' in
honour of the main character from 'Alien', providing a final test of the
capacity of the Dragon capsule to carry personnel to the ISS. [However,
this expansion of access to space brings with it new dangers and
risks]{.underline}. On 27 March 2019 [India announced that it had,
through the process of shooting down its own satellite in Low Earth
Orbit (LEO), become a member of an 'exclusive group of space faring
nations consisting of USA, Russia and China']{.underline}. In other
words, it joined the club of nations that have conducted an ASAT test,
destroying their own space object. Prime Minister Modi declared the
success of Mission Shakti, demonstrated by this kinetic destruction of
the Microsat-R satellite, which had only been launched in January 2019,
'will make India stronger, even more secure and will further peace and
security'. [This 'test', timed to make maximum impact on the upcoming
Indian election, generated global concerns about the increased
militarisation of space, as well as denunciation of the creation of
further space debris]{.underline}, posing a risk to the future
development of a viable commercial space industry. The problems of space
debris have been known (at least) since China destroyed its own weather
satellite in January 2007. The destruction of the FengYun-1C generated a
massive field of space debris, consisting of at least 3000 trackable
pieces. [That debris will continue to pose a hazard to space objects in
that debris field for decades to come. The US destroyed a defunct spy
satellite in 2008, however as the destruction occurred at a lower
altitude, all of the debris from that event is believed to have been
destroyed upon re-entry to the Earth's atmosphere]{.underline}. A 2009
collision between a Russian satellite and a US commercial satellite
similarly created approximately 2000 pieces of debris which are still
being tracked. Following the announcement of the Mission Shakti test,
the Indian Government attempted to pre-empt international criticism of
its actions and ward off accusations of militarisation of outer space by
taking control over the rhetoric used to describe its actions. The
official Frequently Asked Questions on Mission Shakti, India's
Anti-Satellite Missile test conducted on 27 March, 2019 website, hosted
by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, noted that 'India has no
intention of entering into an arms race in outer space. We have always
maintained that space must be used only for peaceful purposes. We are
against the weaponization of Outer Space and support international
efforts to reinforce the safety and security of space based assets.'
Such a statement seems at odds with a test clearly aimed at
demonstrating destructive capability and expressly done to verify that
India 'has the capability to safeguard our space assets'. Further India
claims that the 'test was done in the lower atmosphere to ensure that
there is no space debris. Whatever debris that is generated will decay
and fall back onto the earth within weeks.' There is significant dispute
that the debris field will indeed decay as rapidly as India asserts.
NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine is one of the few public officials to
openly denounce India's actions, noting the risk the debris field posed
to the ISS: 'That is a terrible, terrible thing, to create an event that
sends debris in an apogee that goes above the International Space
Station.' Bridenstine further stated 'that kind of activity is not
compatible with the future of human spaceflight that we need to see
happen.' It is estimated that the Mission Shakti debris has created an
increased risk to the ISS of debris impact. It also poses a risk to
commercial constellations in LEO. The nature of the UN Space Treaties
leaves much uncertainty about permitted uses and activities in space.
The Mission Shakti test did not violate any current international laws
and even the creation of space debris, whilst seen as antisocial, is not
illegal. By focussing the post-test narrative on the fact that the test
would create only minimal debris (and then in a low orbit that would
rapidly decay and lead to the destruction of the debris) India has
redirected attention away from the question regarding the desirability
of prohibiting any further 'tests' of this kind. Further, by restating
that 'India has no intention of entering into an arms race in outer
space', it attempted to place the test in the context of a peaceful
scientific experiment. The FAQ continued: '[We have always maintained
that space must be used only for peaceful purposes. We are against the
weaponization of Outer Space and support international efforts to
reinforce the safety and security of space based assets.']{.underline}
Clearly there is a need to develop new 'rules of the road' to enable
continued access for commercial and civilian actors in space. Concerns
about Trump's Space Force should be measured against the existing risk
to space assets from increased commercial and civilian uses of space. At
the most recent meeting of the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of
Outer Space the German delegation noted that the 'growing number of
space debris unquestionably poses one of the biggest threats to the safe
conduct of outer space activities.' Despite the increasing number of
actors in space, there appears to be worryingly 'low compliance rates
with the space debris mitigation guidelines.' Calling for legally
binding prohibitions upon the intentional destruction of space objects,
the delegation went on to observe that 'In order to keep outer space
operationally safe for use not only today but also for future
generations, we need not only internationally accepted guidelines
prohibiting the intentional destruction of space objects resulting in
the generation of long lasting debris, keeping in mind that the
exploration and use of outer space shall be carried out for the benefit
and in the interest of all countries, but sooner or later we will need
to conduct active debris removal missions. These will inevitably raise
several legal issues such as responsibility and liability. Such
remediation measures may also require further internationally accepted
guidelines as to the transparent and safe conduct of such operations.'
Whilst such a statement seems perfectly reasonable on its face, it
belies the problem that active debris removal technologies function
themselves as anti-satellite weapons. The dual-use nature of space
technology poses unique and difficult issues for regulation. These
challenges can only be effectively addressed with international
consensus. It is noted that there are several projects being undertaken
at an international level to bring some clarity and certainty to the
laws affecting the use of outer space. One of these projects, the
Woomera Manual on the International Law of Military Space Operations,
[brings together experts from across the globe to identify and
articulate the existing international law, including space law and law
of armed conflict, that currently applies to the space
environment]{.underline}, drawing upon real life practices and examples.
In addition to being a comprehensive statement of the applicable law,
the resulting Manual will be of use to governments, militaries and
academics in determining the areas where there are normative gaps in
current regulation. As renowned astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson
reminds us; '**[Space is not a magical place where somehow, suddenly,
everybody is friendly]{.underline}**.' (Tyson and Lang, Accessory to
War, 2018, p 382). National and commercial rivalries alike will continue
to challenge the space domain.

Analysts pointed to Mission Shakti as a vivid example of growing
contestation in the outer space domain. Traditional U.S. dominance in
space has eroded as [a litany of foreign actors (collaborator and
competitor alike) have increased their spacefaring prowess, including
through the development and use of ASAT weapons and dual-use uncrewed
orbiters capable of space rendezvous and proximity
operations]{.underline} \[PDF\]. Pundits fear that such **[space
technologies could alter the calculus of deterrence to inauspicious
effect or, worse, become instruments in an adversary's enactment of a
"space Pearl Harbor."]{.underline}** These fears are valid in some
senses, overblown and misleading in others. Developments in space pose
significant challenges for strategic stability. [Obsessive concern with
the remote contingency of kinetic warfare]{.underline} in orbit,
however, [detracts from efforts to address more pressing space security
issues]{.underline} and makes catastrophic outcomes more, not less,
probable. Missiles and Lasers and Viruses, Oh My Recent years have
witnessed burgeoning democratization in the outer space domain as
plummeting costs---both for manufacturing satellites and placing them in
orbit---and proliferating technologies have enabled new spacefaring
actors to deploy assets in Earth orbit. [The number of active satellites
has ballooned to more than two thousand, and their integration into
military operations and civil life has deepened in tandem. Recognition
of the indispensability of these orbital assets]{.underline} to numerous
areas of strategic competition[, and defense planners' emphasis on
offensive capabilities as a deterrence measure, has led states to invest
large sums in]{.underline} the development of [ASAT weapons]{.underline}
of various stripes. In their April Space Threat Assessment 2019 \[PDF\]
report, Todd Harrison, Kaitlyn Johnson, and Thomas G. Roberts of the
Center for Strategic and International Studies outline four categories
of counterspace operations: [kinetic physical attacks, non-kinetic
physical attacks, electronic attacks, and cyberattacks.]{.underline}
This litany of potential threats, [which vary in their severity,
reversibility, ease of attribution, and other aspects, makes U.S.
policymakers uneasy]{.underline}. After over half a century of
spacefaring pre-eminence, the United States has come to depend on the
remote-sensing, telecommunications, and positioning, navigation, and
timing capabilities that satellites provide. The resounding defeat of
the Iraqi military by American and coalition forces during the Gulf War
of the early 1990s underscored the substantial battlefield advantages
that orbital capabilities confer, and numerous subsequent conflicts have
affirmed the U.S. military's tactical and strategic reliance on space
assets. [Proliferating counterspace systems heighten the potential for
adversaries to disrupt American command, control, and communications
networks, as well as surveillance and reconnaissance
operations.]{.underline} **[In attacking these critical space systems,
U.S. adversaries could compromise large segments of the national defense
enterprise.]{.underline}** Indeed, an insecure orbital environment poses
significant challenges for broader strategic stability. [Actors in
possession of counterspace capabilities can threaten or attack vital
elements of ballistic missile launch detection architectures and other
systems integral to national and international security,]{.underline}
**[which opens new avenues for intentional, inadvertent, or accidental
dispute or conflict escalation.]{.underline}** In this sense, novel
[satellite vulnerabilities add layers of technical and psychological
complexity to already labyrinthine deterrence calculations.]{.underline}
The effect compounds in light of the deep integration of satellites into
information and communications networks: **[cyber intrusions into space
systems are a tantalizing option for state and nonstate actors, and such
operations carry their own elaborate deterrence considerations, not
least the difficulty of attribution]{.underline}**. [The net result is a
convoluted deterrence landscape, rife with uncertainty and in constant
motion thanks to the rapid clip and often competitive character of
technological innovation.]{.underline} Swords of Many Edges For staunch
deterrence advocates, this uncertainty justifies expanding counterspace
arsenals. In their view, preventing a space Pearl Harbor in which a U.S.
adversary launches a crippling surprise attack against American orbital
assets requires evincing the certainty of a devastating counterattack.
[One way of accomplishing this is through the unambiguous demonstration
of effective counterspace capabilities.]{.underline} The clearer the
demonstration, the better. In this sense[, ASAT missile
tests,]{.underline} [which are easy to attribute and spectacular in
nature, hold great allure as a means of signaling orbital strike
capabilities.]{.underline} Such [tests]{.underline}, however, come with
significant drawbacks. The most obvious of these is that they [generate
large amounts of dangerous space debris, which pose serious hazards to
spacecraft. Each new fragment requires monitoring and, in cases of
potential collisions, risk assessment and avoidance
maneuvers]{.underline}. Debris-generating military operations, in this
sense, are a self-defeating proposition. ASAT missile tests also come
with nebulous reputational costs, as the corpus of international space
law, including the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, emphasizes that uses of
space should be peaceful in nature. Likewise, UN Debris Mitigation
Guidelines \[PDF\] affirm the importance of minimizing space junk, a
dictum inconsistent with kinetic weapons testing. Western media heaped
scorn on India for its violation of the important, if incipient, norm
against debris generation, [even after the country took pains to destroy
a low-altitude satellite in order to minimize the lifespan of the bulk
of the fragments.]{.underline} Another important consideration for
would-be [ASAT testers lies in the potential for space militarization to
ignite or exacerbate international arms races.]{.underline} Although
military activities have been a persistent feature of the Space Age,
those activities have often furthered peaceful as much as warlike
pursuits, as has been the case with many remote-sensing operations and
the opening of the U.S. Global Positioning System to civilian use.
[**Militarization is a process rather than a state of affairs, and one
that takes various forms at that. Deterrence implications
notwithstanding, the development and deployment of counterspace
capabilities can drive potential adversaries to develop and deploy
similar capabilities**, contributing to the erosion of norms of peaceful
use.]{.underline}

In our multipolar era, G[-20 meetings have taken on growing importance
as a forum to air and negotiate conflicts]{.underline}. Witness the
upcoming summit this week among the group of leading rich and developing
nations in Osaka, Japan, where [deep threats to the existing world order
will be addressed head-on]{.underline}: rising tensions between the
United States and Iran, a growing trade war between the world's two
largest economies, the state and strength of NATO, unpredictability in
the relationship between the world's top two nuclear powers, and a lack
of rules governing increasingly borderless tech companies. At the end of
June, the [world's major players could make substantial progress
addressing all of them.]{.underline} If they do, [it will fly in the
face of punditry dismissing summits as increasingly pointless diplomatic
exercises, evidence of a rudderless international system following the
decline of Pax Americana]{.underline}. In the "G-Zero" world, according
to this line of thinking, power has been spread too wide and thin. And
too many competing participants have been invited into too many
multilateral decision-making bodies, diluting their impact and
importance---to the detriment of the global economy and global markets.
It is certainly true that a more diffuse distribution of power reduces
stability, makes anarchy more likely, and undermines the provision of
global public goods---indeed, that is effectively an axiom of
international relations. But [that doesn't mean that institutions like
the G-20 are obsolete**. In fact, the more multipolarity accelerates,
the more meaningful and relevant multilateral institutions will
become.**]{.underline} This is true for two main reasons. [First, given
the United States' decreased appetite for providing public
goods]{.underline} (including trade regimes, shipping lanes, and
security guarantees), **[other powers such as China, Japan, Russia, and
even the European Union are stepping in to fill the void. And even if
the body is flawed, the G-20 can provide critical coordination and
conflict resolution mechanisms for such efforts.]{.underline}** Second,
and relatedly, [such forums provide business and markets with critical
information about how alliances and power dynamics are shifting in a
more fluid international system.]{.underline} That's true even if global
policymaking itself is less efficient. The upcoming Osaka summit should
prove an excellent example. [It offers a timely opportunity to gather
together every key external player in the Iran imbroglio, for
example]{.underline}. Although formal progress toward better U.S.-Iran
relations is unlikely, [the summit will provide important signals on the
potential for war and peace.]{.underline} In addition, expect host and
new G-20 president Japan to coordinate anti-protectionist nations at the
summit, exploiting its star role in sustaining the (now sans-United
States) Trans-Pacific Partnership and its new EU-Japan trade deal to do
so. At the very least, [Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe can provide
positive atmospherics for a much-anticipated summit meeting between U.S.
President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping]{.underline},
[the outcome of which could]{.underline} [determine the
fate,]{.underline} at least in the near-to-medium term, **[of the global
economy.]{.underline}** At the same time, [Trump and Russian President
Vladimir Putin are also scheduled to meet]{.underline}, which is
relevant not only in light of the breakdown of U.S.-Russian arms
treaties but also in terms of growing conflict over Russia between the
White House and the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, [G-20 finance ministers
appear to have made significant progress in agreeing to a new digital
tax on multinational firms, a major development in the growing conflict
between tech companies and the state that will likely be reinforced at
the approaching summit.]{.underline} Recent trends in U.S. and global
markets help reinforce these points. [First, increasing geopolitical
risk has actually accompanied a boom in U.S. and global equity markets,
suggesting that **declining U.S. hegemony and growing multipolarity is
not necessarily bad for business**]{.underline}---or at least for stock
prices. At the same time, markets have often turned downward around the
time of recent G-20 summits. At the very least, this pattern indicates
the **[G-20 events are important to markets,]{.underline}** suggesting
that developments at G-20 meetings [may wake up the market to otherwise
discounted or mispriced geopolitical risks. **The importance of the G-20
and bodies like it will only grow in a more multipolar
world**]{.underline}. As rare but institutionalized gatherings of major
global political economies and their leaders, [G-20 forums will be the
place to understand shifting alliances and power dynamics.]{.underline}
[They will provide information about major geopolitical and geoeconomic
uncertainties.]{.underline} Political and economic deals will be done
and undone; conflicts revived and resolved; grievances accelerated and
appeased. The result will not be order, per se. But it will certainly be
more order---and more information about that order. In short: [something
far greater than zero.]{.underline}

### Multipolarity Solves -- China Relations

#### Abandoning hegemony is key to forge relations between the US & China that can resolve climate change, global inequality, and nuclear war

Dangers and prospects To say all this is dangerous is an understatement.
The costs of a ramped-up trade war would fall hardest on the working
classes in both U.S. and China---and if it leads to a global downturn,
on workers and the poor across the globe. [Calls to "get tough on China"
are]{.underline}, at bottom, [ways of shifting blame for people\'s
economic woes away from the U.S. corporate elite.]{.underline} As Tobita
Chow explained in July for In These Times, they tap into [and reinforce
the anti-Chinese racism long present in U.S. politics]{.underline} and
marginalize even the idea of solidarity between workers in both
countries. And [the multi-front Cold War]{.underline} described by
Michael Klare [means constant tension]{.underline}, with the very real
danger that **[an initially small flashpoint conflict could escalate
into full-scale, even nuclear, war]{.underline}**. Short of short open
conflict, [constant tension between Washington and Beijing increases the
influence of **nationalism, militarism and authoritarianism** in
both]{.underline} [countries]{.underline}, which almost inevitably
translates into increases in domestic repression of popular movements,
as well as austerity. What does all this mean for the left? There are
important debates on the nature of China\'s social system and the impact
of its geopolitical and global economic strategies. But regardless of
one\'s position in those debates, the U.S. left has a critical role to
play in galvanizing opposition to the growing clamor for confrontation
in U.S.-China relations. We can do this. But [we need a vision and
practice that speaks to both humanity\'s common interest in sheer
survival and the global working class\' interest in a just and
non-exploitative society. **We should prioritize the fight for a
180-degree turnaround in the U.S. stance toward China**]{.underline},
[demanding that diplomacy and negotiation replace trade wars and
military encirclement]{.underline}. We should call for [a switch from
the goal of "containing China" to the goal of forging **a U.S. China
partnership**]{.underline} [that **would** **take common action against
climate change and support a global campaign to address extreme
poverty**]{.underline} worldwide. This China-focused effort would be one
component of a campaign to de-escalate all global conflicts, and turn to
diplomacy over military force. [Such a campaign should push the U.S.
government to abandon pursuit of hegemony in favor or acceptance of the
fact that we all live in a multi-polar world]{.underline} where, as
Martin Luther King declared in 1983, "We must learn to live together as
brothers \[sic\] or perish together as fools." Making progress on this
front will be a challenge, not least because of the barrage of punditry
and dominant media framing about China, which focuses exclusively on
(often legitimate) grievances and problems---and presents a one-sided
picture of a complex society. On top of this, the Trump-dominated GOP
and anti-China Democrats are the ones with the most clout on U.S.-China
relations. Despite these obstacles, [there is a basis for building a
broad-front campaign to redirect U.S.-China relations for the sake of
the planet]{.underline} and its inhabitants. [Such a campaign\'s
demands]{.underline} would be consistent with the principle of the Green
New Deal on a global scale, [would recognize that the United States and
China are the world\'s largest emitters of carbon
dioxide]{.underline}---China due to the size of its population, the
United States due to its per-capita pollution levels. **[A successful
international effort to avert catastrophic climate change depends on
joint action by the two countries.]{.underline}** Within all
working-class and social justice movements, [it's vital to]{.underline}
bring internationalism and anti-racism to the fore and [stress how a
decrease in tensions between states sets more favorable conditions for
democratic rights struggles]{.underline} and working-class movements in
all countries. An important part of this effort is forging direct ties
between workers in the United States and those in China, as well as
other countries. The last few years have seen a crackdown on independent
labor organizing under Xi Jinping and fewer chances for international
worker-to-worker interaction. But their common interests remain: Both
U.S. and Chinese workers confront many of the same transnationals. And
because Beijing\'s crackdown is directly connected to greater tensions
with Washington and fears that the United States will try to take
advantage of protests in China to undermine the Chinese government---as
the United States has done in so many other countries---fighting to
reduce U.S.-China tensions will ultimately benefit Chinese workers.
Gaining ground here is obviously a difficult process. But in the context
of a surging resistance to Trumpism that includes newly combative layers
of workers and a growing socialist contingent, possibilities exist that
were unimaginable even five years ago. [We don\'t have time to
waste]{.underline}. Towards the end of the U.S.-USSR Cold War, Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev called for "a new way of thinking" whereby
**[all countries,]{.underline}** despite major ideological and political
differences, **[would recognize that our collective security was
imperiled by the threat of nuclear war, environmental devastation and
violence produced by the extreme impoverishment of hundreds of millions
of people]{.underline}**. Gorbachev\'s call for common action against
those threats was overwhelmed by the failure of his attempt to
restructure Soviet society, as well as by the wave of capitalist
triumphalism and U.S. aggression following the Soviet collapse. But all
those dangers remain. Indeed, [we are 30 years further down the road
toward **climate catastrophe, global inequality**]{.underline} [is
greater than it was in the 1980s, and Washington is now
producing]{.underline} **[nuclear weapons that are more likely to be
used than ever]{.underline}**. And this time, [it is the U.S.-China
relationship which will largely decide what path humanity
takes.]{.underline}

### Multipolarity Solves -- UQ 

#### Global allies are already rebalancing away from hegemony towards multipolar strategic autonomy. The EU and China all have vested political and economic interests in the world order which ensures peaceful transition and further cooperation over the economy and global warming.

For a onetime chaos candidate, [Trump has been remarkably methodical in
his efforts to destroy the liberal international order]{.underline}. His
[lacerating of trans-Atlantic relations]{.underline} has been on full
display in recent weeks, from his [disavowal of the G-7 communiqué to
his trade war against U.S. allies to his undermining of NATO to his
attacks on the European Union]{.underline} to his prostration before
Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. In 18 short months, **[he
has torn at the roots and hacked at the branches of Western
solidarity]{.underline}** that his predecessors painstakingly cultivated
over seven decades. [Stunned U.S. allies are now adapting to their new
normal by]{.underline} taking steps previously unimaginable. They are
**[hedging their bets in dawning recognition that the America of old may
never return]{.underline}**, regardless of who succeeds Trump. [They are
pursuing strategic autonomy, seeking to decouple from an unpredictable
United States]{.underline}. And **[they are considering how to
restore]{.underline}** some semblance of **[international
cooperation]{.underline}** in a world left rudderless **[in the wake of
the U.S. abdication]{.underline}** [of global leadership.]{.underline}
Collectively, [Trump's actions have sent U.S. allies
reeling]{.underline}, [shaking their long-standing faith in the West as
a community of shared values, interests, and institutions]{.underline}.
In response, [**they are working with China to safeguard
globalization**, expanding their own strategic autonomy]{.underline}
vis-à-vis Washington, [and grasping to defend what remains]{.underline}
of the open world from the depredations of its erstwhile creator.
Aligning with China to defend globalization [Trump's trade
protectionism]{.underline} has done the seemingly unimaginable. It [has
allowed mercantilist China]{.underline}---which flagrantly steals
intellectual property, restricts foreign investment, and protects entire
sectors from foreign competition---[to portray itself as a bastion of
multilateral]{.underline} trade. Shortly before Trump's inauguration,
Chinese President Xi Jinping was in Davos, Switzerland, channeling
former U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull and depicting himself as the
savior of globalization. **[Europeans increasingly agree]{.underline}**.
On July 16, the [EU and China held their first summit in two
year]{.underline}s. [They declared their commitment to a]{.underline}
**["rules-based, transparent, non-discriminatory, open and inclusive
multilateral trading system]{.underline}** with the WTO as its core."
The Trump administration, by contrast, has vowed to ignore adverse
findings by the WTO's dispute settlement understanding and is reportedly
considering quitting the organization entirely, on the grounds that it
restricts U.S. sovereignty and retaliatory options. This would be an
extraordinary blunder for the nation that not only spearheaded the WTO's
founding but has won a whopping 91 percent of the cases it has brought
before the dispute resolution body. While the EU has thus far resisted
Chinese entreaties to enter into a full-fledged trade alliance against
the United States, that prospect is becoming more likely. Such an
alliance would be a pale imitation of the high-standard, liberalizing
trade deals that the Obama administration pursued in the Trans-Pacific
Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
negotiations. Otherwise, [it's clear that the bloc is not sitting
still.]{.underline} [**The EU has signed a free trade agreement with
Japan and is exploring another with Mercosur, the South American trade
bloc.** This is not the first time that Trump's actions have pushed the
EU into China's arms]{.underline}. A year ago, [when the president
repudiated]{.underline} the [Paris]{.underline} climate accord,
**[Brussels and Beijing jointly reconfirmed their
adherence]{.underline}**. Whatever their qualms about China's rise,
**[European leaders are willing to partner with the country to prevent
global economic fragmentation and preserve a fragile
planet.]{.underline}** Pursuing strategic autonomy Since January 2017,
America's allies have grappled with a split-screen presidency. The
president's advisors and underlings, including in the Defense and State
departments, have reassured NATO and U.S. allies that U.S. security
guarantees are ironclad. Meanwhile, Trump repeatedly has castigated
those same allies for freeloading on U.S. generosity and suggested that
solemn U.S. obligations are conditional. In a July 17 interview with Fox
News host Tucker Carlson, Trump questioned the very core of NATO's
principle of collective defense, wondering why Americans should die to
defend tiny Montenegro, which joined the alliance last year. Trump's
stance is likely to find support among many Americans---half of whom
(according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll) believe that the United States
should not come to the aid of its allies unless they increase defense
spending. That reality has sent shudders through the alliance. [Trump's
improvisational style]{.underline}---including announcing the suspension
of what he called provocative military exercises on the Korean Peninsula
without informing Seoul (or even the Pentagon)---[and his readiness to
appease Moscow]{.underline}, for instance by advocating for the
loosening of Western sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of
Crimea, [have unnerved U.S. allies. Reassurances from U.S. diplomats and
defense officials increasingly ring hollow.]{.underline} They remind one
of Richard Pryor's famous question: "Who you gonna believe, me or your
lying eyes?" [To cope with uncertainty, the allies are hedging, building
their own defense capacities as a form of self-insurance and decoupling
themselves from life-or-death decision]{.underline}s made by the
capricious, transactional leader in Washington. In Asia, [Japan is
spending unprecedented sums on defense,]{.underline} and [South Korea is
seeking national control over its military]{.underline} in the event of
war with North Korea, rather than continuing to accept U.S. command.
**[But in Europe the fallout has been most intense]{.underline}**.
Trump's insults have engendered impatience with being America's
"doormat" and stimulated a quest for "strategic autonomy." A swelling
chorus calls on the EU to take responsibility for its own defense and to
develop capabilities outside of a NATO dominated by a supreme allied
commander who takes orders from the White House. [This European bid for
autonomy is in its infancy, but the signals are clear]{.underline}. In
November 2017, [the EU approved]{.underline} what it calls [Permanent
Structured Cooperation]{.underline} (PESCO), an initiative [permitting
25 of its 28 members to pool defense efforts]{.underline}. While a far
cry from the integrated European Defense Community that the Europeans
considered the 1950s**[, PESCO could be the kernel of a full-fledged
continental defense arrangement]{.underline}**. For those reasons, the
U.S. ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, has criticized it as a
threat to the alliance's integrity and a diversion of allied resources.
But the Trump administration cannot have it both ways. It cannot
simultaneously insist on increased European defense spending while
undermining allied confidence in U.S. security guarantees---and then be
surprised when Europeans invest in autonomous capabilities. After all,
[the principle of collective defense presupposes a strong
collectivity.]{.underline} This sense of solidarity is precisely what
Trump undermines with his my-way-or-the-highway leadership style, which
assumes that followers have no alternatives. If Europeans had any doubts
about who the president thinks calls the shots, the scales fell from
their eyes in May when Trump abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, despite
entreaties from the leaders of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who had sought to win over Trump by
cultivating a warm personal rapport, was denied---though not before
Trump reportedly asked him, "Why don't you leave the EU?" promising a
bilateral trade accord as a sweetener. Filling the void In embracing the
doctrine of America First, Trump has signaled that henceforth the United
States will look after number one, rather than serve as the custodian of
world order and the champion of human freedom. The U.S. return to a
pre-1941 mindset has left its democratic partners wondering: Now that
Atlas has shrugged, who will fill the void? [Pundits have variously
anointed Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and even Canadian
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the new leader of the free
worl]{.underline}d. But none of these leaders commands anything close to
the national power and diplomatic heft to assume that burden. [If the
rules-based international order is to survive, it will be a collective
enterprise, spearheaded by the European Union, in close cooperation with
other democratic partners]{.underline} both established (such as Japan,
South Korea, and Australia) and emerging (such as India). "Can Europe
save the world order?" ask Anthony Dworkin and Mark Leonard of the
European Council on Foreign Relations. The odds seem long. The bloc has
been weakened by successive crises over mass migration, terrorism, the
eurozone, and Brexit, and populist nationalists are on the rise in Italy
and Eastern Europe. Trapped between a customs union and a political
union---and overly reliant on a Franco-German axis without which nothing
can happen but which often fails to deliver---the EU lacks the unity,
dynamism, and decisiveness long associated with the United States. And
without the latter by its side---in the Human Rights Council, among
other places---the EU will find it hard to hold the line against
authoritarian attacks from Russia, China, and other enemies of political
freedom and liberal order. To lead the world, the EU will need to
redouble its own internal reform efforts, hold the line against populist
and nationalist forces, reaffirm its commitment to open trade, expand
its autonomous military capabilities, ramp up its contributions to
global public goods (particularly on climate change), and find its voice
as a consistent champion of human rights. This is a tall order. [The EU
remains]{.underline}, however, [the best hope for liberal
internationalists as]{.underline} they wait to see whether the Trump
revolution proves [an enduring course correction]{.underline} in
America's global role or merely a temporary national detour at the hands
of an impaired, sui generis leader. "As ye sow, so shall ye reap," the
Bible instructs. Donald Trump suggests that the reverse may also be
true. The grim reaper of the liberal international order has sown
discord that will outlive his departure.

[Since WWII, the US grand strategy has focused on pursuing geopolitical
dominance]{.underline}, a unipolar strategy, which has revolved around
maintaining its overwhelming military, economic, and political
preponderance through the promotion of democracy and human rights abroad
that is often touted as national security or foreign policy. With the
end of the Cold War, the US has managed to maintain its great advantage
by making its allies more secure and therefore, keeping its hegemony and
the world order. The US continues to dominate the international system
and thus discourages advanced industrial nations from challenging its
leadership. Furthermore, the US has used a policy of reassurance to
secure US interests and provide security to key allies which has
prevented them from building their own military capabilities. Some may
argue that **[this US unipolar strategy provoked terrorist attacks
against the US and its allies]{.underline}**, **[and it did not prevent
the rise of new global powers]{.underline}**. [Thus, US primacy has not
been entirely successful in guaranteeing its security]{.underline} or
economic and political supremacy. [Moreover, the US has moved far beyond
counterterrorism to counterinsurgency]{.underline}, and [from the
temporary deployment of small anti-terrorism forces to a near-permanent
military presence]{.underline}. The American [response to terrorism has
undermined critical elements of US 'soft' power]{.underline} in the
international arena, even as its 'hard' power has been reinforced.
Notwithstanding its unipolar status, the [terrorist assaults on American
and its allies' homeland demonstrated dramatically that the US faces
significant challenges]{.underline} beyond the realm of great power
competition. In terms of security strategy, [the Trump administration
has clearly drawn away from the American grand strategic
tradition]{.underline} of retrenchment or deep engagement. ['America
First' seems to have to address US foreign policy by]{.underline}
withdrawing from certain treaties and [intervening in the pursuit of US
security and prosperity]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} US [current
administration aims to maintain its security and prosperity by allowing
other great powers to promote a global liberal]{.underline}
[order]{.underline}. The Trump administration uses foreign policy more
ambitiously because it considers an unprecedented grand strategy of
illiberal hegemony. Traditional US liberal hegemony strategy used to
focus on promoting democracy and human rights, creating multilateral
institutions, and mirroring the international system vis-à-vis the US
values. In contrast, [Trump's illiberal hegemony strategy seeks superior
economic and military capability by portraying the US as the world's
arbiter]{.underline}. Such an expensive strategy has increased the US
defense budget, security and military commitments, and nuclear
modernization programs. Contrary to previous administrations that
invested considerable sums of money in building democracy abroad, the
Trump administration envisions engagement with the world's security
problems by targeting its main allies -- Europe, Japan, and Saudi
Arabia. Trump's foreign policy in Europe intensified EU efforts to
reduce an over-reliance on US protection. It seems that the US
administration is trying to return NATO to Europe by mitigating its
financial contribution and military spending for a NATO expansion. As a
result, the EU launched a military joint-force, PESCO, that could pave
the way for an EU army. PESCO was first established in the 2009 Lisbon
Treaty, as an EU defense cooperation. PESCO members have pledged to
increase defense budgets in real terms regularly, genuinely pursue
national investments with due consideration for joint capability needs,
expose national plans to EU scrutiny, and, ultimately, provide more
strategically deployable forces than currently available today. This
force could play a leading role in scenarios such as peace support
operations in the Western Balkans. Although the US has shown a
hesitation to embrace the idea of deeper European defense integration
fully, the US should support a more self-reliant EU. When it comes to
defense, the goal is also to improve competitiveness and enhance
innovation across the continent's defense industry. In a post-Brexit
world, the momentum behind PESCO offers an opportunity for the US to
revisit the EU's legacy goal of deploying and sustaining 60,000 ground
troops as part of a joint force. In Asia, Japan is the most relevant US
partner in some foreign policy areas, particularly in security concerns,
which range from hedging against Chinese military modernization to
countering threats from North Korea. In 2018, Japan's military sees
record spending, aiming at buying more US arms. Japan's Ministry of
Defense in August sought record spending of 5.3 trillion-yen next year
to help pay for significant upgrades to defenses designed to shoot down
any North Korean ballistic missile. Japan military budget has grown for
the seventh year in a row. The US should allow Japan to pursue its own
military capability, which would lead to a political, military and
economic balance or rivalry within the region. As for the Middle East,
US-Saudi alliance is extremely important for the US foreign policy due
to the US national interests of economic prosperity, security, the fight
against terrorism and energy supply. Trump's first foreign visit as US
president was to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, where a military deal worth
\$110 billion between the two countries was penned. The Trump
administration has sought to strengthen ties to Saudi Arabia by signing
this arms sales contract. Additionally, President Trump dismissed
proposals to cut arms sales to the kingdom and backed the Saudi Crown
Prince, Mohammed bin Salman's assertions that he did not order the
killing, despite the reported conclusions of the CIA. Furthermore, Saudi
Arabia is the top destination for US arms, with US defense sales to the
kingdom totaling close to \$90 billion for the past seventy years. In
addition, both countries share security concerns about Iran. They both
have ramped up efforts to counter Iran, Saudi Arabia's main regional
rival. Regarding energy supply, the US imports only 25% of Saudi oil
reserves, whereas US allies -- Europe and Japan -- depend on the Middle
Eastern oil, and therefore, should share the responsibility for
stabilizing the region. [By sharing with its allies the world's security
problems, the US strengthens the allies' presence, shares information,
and develops deep cooperation]{.underline}. [Thus, the US and its allies
need to]{.underline} work together and [better balance the burden of
democratic world order]{.underline}. Alliances are better for everyone
and [institutions facilitate iterated interactions amongst
members.]{.underline} The US and European countries cofounded most of
the world's institutions in the aftermath of WWII. Such institutions
helped shape the world we live in. Therefore, [the US should maintain
its robust presence in these institutions as well as in multilateral
agreements]{.underline}. As for counterterrorism and counterinsurgency,
[the US and its allies should increase their interaction regarding
strategic intelligence based on allied security forces. Terrorism is the
world's problem that needs a collective effort to fight against it.
Short-term military actions informed by long-term analysis, would
reshape the international environment and constrain terrorist
attacks.]{.underline} The Trump administration should develop a range of
politically credible, clearly articulated indirect actions to support
the allies' efforts to improve their civil defense capabilities. **[By
adopting a multipolar strategy, the US would allow other nations to
build their military capabilities and provide for their own national and
regional security. In this great geopolitical rebalancing, states share
the burden of maintaining stability in various parts of the world,
looking for absolute gains and more peaceful relations.]{.underline}**

### Retrenchment Good

[China's new assertiveness and the sudden inward turn of United States
are a function of]{.underline} causes located in both the second and
third images. The key second-image variable is nationalism, which
combines with the power trajectories (a third-image variable) of both
China and the United States to define how their relationship will unfold
in the coming years. The interaction between [nationalism and power
trajectory]{.underline} produces entirely different foreign policy
orientations in rising and declining powers---the former embraces an
outward-looking, extroverted foreign policy of expansion, while the
latter adopts an inward-looking, introverted foreign policy of restraint
and retrenchment. The **[resurgent nationalisms of the rising challenger
and the declining hegemon are entirely compatible with]{.underline}** a
future relationship characterized by **[peace and
harmony]{.underline}**. Obviously, [the two nationalisms pose no
inherent conflict of interests]{.underline}: [China currently wants more
global influence; the Unites States wants less.]{.underline} Hence,
**[there is good reason to expect a soft landing as the world moves from
unipolarity to bipolarity.]{.underline}** Now as always, states pursue
their interests by responding not only to the competitive pressures of
the international system but also to forces and demands emanating from
within their borders. While we may prefer that our theories avoid
explanations that mix causes at different levels of analysis,1 causal
drivers within these two spheres---a.k.a. the second and third
images---necessarily interact with one another. This simple, almost
axiomatic insight lies at the heart of neoclassical realism. Witness the
current trend for the past several years: resurgent nationalism (second
image) and great power competition under increasingly multipolar
conditions (third image). This is no coincidence; the two phenomena are
related. 1 For reasons not to mix levels of analysis, see J. David

on 10 April 2018 Along these lines and using a neoclassical realist
framework, I argue that [both rising and declining powers experience
surging nationalism in their domestic politics]{.underline}. [Their
nationalisms]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, [focus on opposite
ends of the telescope]{.underline}: the growth of nationalism within
rising powers is directed outward; whereas nationalism that takes root
in declining powers looks inward. [Thus, nationalism is said to be on
the rise in both the United States and China]{.underline}. But the
motivations for its ascent in the two countries are entirely different
owing to their opposite trajectories within the structure of the
international system. This explains why Washington and Beijing are
undergoing key shifts in the direction of their foreign policies---[the
United States is retreating from deep engagement and global influence,
just as China is seeking more foreign influence]{.underline}, seizing
its external opportunities with both hands.2 The Argument in Brief
China's new assertiveness and the sudden inward turn of the United
States are a function of causes located in both the second and third
images. The key secondimage variable is nationalism, which combines with
the power trajectories (a third-image variable) of both China and the
United States to define how their relationship will unfold in the coming
years. [The interaction between nationalism and power trajectory
produces entirely different foreign policy orientations in rising and
declining powers]{.underline}---**[the former embraces an
outward-looking, extroverted foreign policy of expansion, while the
latter adopts an inward-looking, introverted foreign policy of restraint
and retrenchment]{.underline}**. Why the focus on nationalism?
[Nationalism]{.underline} provides a natural complement to structural
realist theory; it [is rightly viewed as realism's domestic-level
counterpart]{.underline}.3 The constant struggle among nations over
issues of power, security, and prestige that animates realism is in no
small part a consequence of [nationalism]{.underline}, which '[fuels
interstate rivalry and]{.underline} by its sharp delineation of in- and

unabated. [Moreover, leaders of rising powers often whip up domestic
nationalism to back their expansionist]{.underline}
[policies]{.underline} and/or to divert the public's dissatisfaction
with the pace of internal reforms and economic progress. [Less
intuitively, nationalism can also support]{.underline} a policy of
[hegemonic retrenchment---redeploying military forces offshore,
demanding that allies pay more for their defense, and reassessing trade
agreements]{.underline} through a mercantilist lens with the aim of
achieving favorable trade balances. Because of the redistribution of
power, [the costs to the declining hegemon of managing the international
system increase relative to its capacity to pay]{.underline}. The
problem becomes, as Walter Lippmann characterized it, the balancing of
commitments and resources.5 **[An important means of bringing costs and
resources into balance is to reduce overseas
commitments]{.underline}**---that is, political, economic, or military
retrenchment---**[either by passing the 'balancing' buck to one's
allies]{.underline}** (insisting on greater burden-sharing within the
alliance), **[by unilaterally abandoning commitments, by seeking
rapprochement]{.underline}** with less threatening, secondary rivals,
**[by attempting to appease the rising power]{.underline}**, or by some
combination thereof.6 [All of these policies fit within the larger
context of global retreat]{.underline}---of a weary titan coming home.
The natural complement to this grand strategy is a xenophobic
nationalism rooted in the rallying cry of 'we must do more for ourselves
and less for others, who should learn to take care of themselves and
solve their own problems'---the opposite, it should be noted, of 'the
proper maxim of an unchallenged number one': 'Do good for others in
order to do well for yourself.'7 Most important, **[the resurgent
nationalisms of the rising challenger and the declining hegemon are
entirely compatible with a future relationship characterized by peace
and harmony]{.underline}**. Obviously, the two nationalisms pose no
inherent conflict of interests: [China currently wants more global
influence; the United States wants less.]{.underline} Hence, [there is
good reason to expect a soft landing as the world moves from unipolarity
to bipolarity.]{.underline} Indeed, **[the future may well
resemble]{.underline}** President Xi Jinping's proposal for a 'new type
of great power relations' (xinxing daguo guanxi), **[the idea that China
and the United States should share global leadership as
equals]{.underline}** and break a historical pattern of inevitable
confrontation between rising and established powers.8 There is room in

long as they treat each other as equals.9 If China continues to grow
economically and militarily, then, like every other rising power in
history, it will surely seek to expand its influence in the AsiaPacific
region and throughout the globe. The question remains, how should
Washington respond? **[Operating within an emerging bipolar world,

hegemony, the United States should wait and see if its regional allies

the United States will be required to deploy enough firepower to the
region to restore a stable balance. [The aim is to remain offshore as
long as possible, while recognizing that it may become necessary for US

however, Washington's Asia-Pacific allies should still do much of the
heavy lifting.10

America's decline relative to a rising China has sparked interest among
academics about power shifts in the international order---whether they
can happen peacefully and under what conditions; what precedents exist
and what they tell us. Now comes an important book, Twilight of the
Titans, by Joseph M. Parent and Paul K. McDonald, who use quantitative
analysis of power transitions to analyze the problem. What they find
provides a warning to a rising China, and a road map for a declining
United States to regain its standing. The Harvard political scientist
Graham Allison called [the problem "the Thucydides Trap," in which the
country in relative decline so fears the rise of a challenger that it
chooses to go to war to prevent it.]{.underline} And while Allison's
book Destined for War has its detractors, it served the worthwhile
purpose of drawing us all back to Thucydides's History of the
Peloponnesian Wars and sounding the alarm that [U.S. policies designed
to confront China risked accelerating American decline.]{.underline} One
reason Allison was roundly criticized was that in order to have a large
enough number of cases to write a political-science book, he created
"transitions" among great powers that didn't withstand rigorous
examination. So, for example, [Britain and France ceding ground to
Germany after World War II is strongly conditioned by those three
countries having a common security guarantor, the United
State]{.underline}s, that was substantially stronger, and that advocated
for and buffeted the change. [History has really seen only one peaceful
hegemonic transition: Britain to the United States in the late 19th
century. **It remains an open question whether nuclear weapons will
stabilize hegemonic transition.**]{.underline} One important question
Allison's book raises is whether the strongest states in the
international order behave differently from other states. [A hegemon is
the rule setter and enforcer in the international order.]{.underline} It
is typically (but not necessarily) the strongest power, [because states
fight for the right to establish terms favorable to their interests---so
Britain after the Napoleonic Wars, which "ruled the waves," could waive
the rules;]{.underline} and the United States in the 20th century and
especially after World War II became the architect of what is called the
liberal international order, or the rules-based international order.
Parent and McDonald survey power transitions since 1870 (when data on
gross domestic product first started being reliably collected) to
explore the behavior of both the top states in the order and the lesser
but still powerful states. They examine 16 cases of relative decline,
some by hegemonic powers and some by mid-level states. [What they find
is that most states respond sensibly to relative decline, undertaking
prompt, proportionate retrenchment, because they seek strategic
solvency---they don't want to go bankrupt]{.underline} (and thus lose
their independence). **[That is, the sensible policy choices that helped
make them powerful also help them cope with straitened circumstances and
decide to reduce their military and avoid armed
conflicts]{.underline}**. [For most states, the choice of retrenchment
helps them regain stature; those that fail to retrench never
do.]{.underline} The authors also find that [states experiencing decline
are not generally seen as inviting targets for aggression by others. So
rising states are not generally tempted to attack a weakening
rival]{.underline}. Parent and McDonald's research suggests this is
because **[the states experiencing decline steer clear of
conflicts---war being the unsentimental arbiter of state power,
declining states would rather not risk demonstrating their
diminution.]{.underline}** Their research also suggests that these
[states tend to prevail in the conflicts they do choose to
initiate]{.underline}. Parent and McDonald conclude, "[This suggests
that declining powers are flexible and formidable."]{.underline} The
Chinese Communist Party leadership would have benefited from Parent and
McDonald's research, showing as it does that "premature bids for
hegemony can not only encourage the formation of hostile foreign
coalitions but also upset the fragile domestic foundations of long-term
growth." For all the talk of China's leaders as brilliant strategists
with a hundred-year time horizon in their planning, their choices in the
past decade would seem to conform to Parent and McDonald's description
of a premature bid for hegemony. This is all good news for the United
States in a time of waning relative power in the international order. If
the future conforms to the data, [we can expect a United States that
gets its house in order while avoiding wars]{.underline}, [as the
Chinese activate antibodies against their continued rise, and thereby
allow the U.S. to regain its former standing.]{.underline} This is not
as good news for [America's allies, who will have to bear more of the
cost, risk, and responsibility of defending their security and sustain
an international order beneficial to their interests.]{.underline}

#### Retrenchment now is key -- prevents a laundry list of impacts

Even beyond airstrikes, [U.S. troops can deploy to virtually any region
fast enough that they can be based in the continental United
States]{.underline}. In emergency situations, according to Rand,
"[lighter ground forces can deploy by air from the United States almost
as quickly as they can from within a region]{.underline}." 53 An armored
brigade combat team can get from Germany to Kuwait in approximately 18
days, only about 4 days more quickly than if it deployed from the East
Coast of the United States. 54 U.S.-based forces could handicap
contingency responsiveness in certain smaller missions. The transit time
to the Taiwan Strait, for example, for a carrier strike group deployed
from Yokosuka, Japan, would take 3 to 5 days, whereas deployment from
the West Coast would take up to 16 days. However, basing capacity in
Hawaii or Guam can cut those transit times considerably. 55 Admittedly,
deploying heavy forces by air in bulk is not plausible for contingencies
requiring massive ground troops. But contingencies that truly depend on
extremely rapid deployment are rare. The United States tends to have the
luxury of intervening at its own pace. And, given America's relative
insulation from external threats, it's not clear that speedy
intervention is even desirable. For one thing, **[reducing the emphasis
on rapid response would likely signal to allies the need to cut back on
free riding]{.underline}** (that is, spending less on the military in
the expectation that the United States will carry their defense burden).
Moreover, [**robbing the executive branch of the ability to rapidly
insert the United States into a military conflict** abroad may indeed be
a good thing]{.underline}. Since World War II, constitutional
restrictions on the president's war-making powers have eroded. But the
Framers of the Constitution were wise to constrain the president's
war-making powers. [Affording the executive a speedy response with
in-place forces]{.underline}, therefore, not only undermines the rule of
law but also [can intensify war proneness]{.underline}. As Bernard
Brodie once wrote, "the notion that it is incontestably good to expand
the chief executive's options is rather peculiar" because "it runs
directly counter to the basic tenets of constitutional government" and
because "[one way of keeping people out of trouble is to deny them the
means for getting into it]{.underline}." 56 Vulnerability,
Counterbalancing, and Entanglement [Keeping U.S. troops permanently
stationed abroad presents several strategic problems]{.underline}.
[First, such **forces are more vulnerable to attack than forces
stationed at home**]{.underline}. Even though the preponderance of U.S.
power and the general decline in international war probably mean that
U.S. overseas bases are not at risk of bombardment in the immediate
future, [certain plausible contingencies could make them priority
targets]{.underline}. If conflict breaks out over Taiwan or
maritime-territorial disputes in the East China Sea or the South China
Sea, the United States would be obligated to intervene against China to
fulfill its security guarantee to Taiwan, Japan, or the Philippines,
which would then trigger Chinese actions against U.S. assets. 57 To take
another example that is now more remote, thanks to the recently
negotiated nuclear deal with Iran, if Israel were to preventively strike
one of Iran's nuclear facilities, the United States would be implicated
immediately because of its promises to fight to defend Israel. 58
According to a 2012 report, U.S. bases in Bahrain would be a priority
target in Iranian retaliatory strikes. 59 For facilities based in
certain countries, particularly in the Middle East, the risk of
terrorist attacks on military bases has increased in recent years. Not
only are homemade explosives and car bombs easier to access and produce,
but also---especially after the damage done by the post-9/11 wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan---an anti-American narrative has become even more
popular, making U.S. bases desirable targets for terrorist attacks.
**[Overseas bases can inspire blowback in the form of
terrorism]{.underline}**. According to Robert Pape, "**[the principal
cause of suicide terrorism is resistance to foreign
occupation]{.underline}**." 60 Infamous examples, like [the 1983
bombings of the Marine barracks in Beirut]{.underline}, Lebanon, that
killed 241 Americans, and [the al Qaeda attack in 2000]{.underline} on
the USS Cole [off the coast of Yemen, are illustrative]{.underline}. 61
But [bases can also motivate attacks on U.S. soil]{.underline}. The
[presence]{.underline} of U.S. military bases [in Saudi Arabia was one
of the most prominent grievances cited by al Qaeda in the lead-up to the
9/11 attacks]{.underline}. 62 And the post-9/11 surge in the U.S.
military presence in the Middle East coincided with a massive increase
in the rate of terrorist attacks inspired by anti-Americanism. 63 In
addition to terrorism, [the development of extremely
accurate]{.underline} intermediate- and long-range [ballistic
missiles]{.underline} [and modern satellite-based sensors]{.underline},
among other innovations, [makes overseas bases susceptible to asymmetric
attacks that are very difficult to defend against]{.underline}. China,
in particular, has invested heavily in these capabilities, meaning that
a large percentage of U.S. facilities---more than 90 percent of U.S. air
facilities in northeast Asia---are in high-threat areas. China's
conventional theater-strike system, the DF-21, "can hit all military
facilities along the entire Japanese archipelago," says Toshi Yoshihara,
the chair of Asia-Pacific Studies at the U.S. Naval War College. 64
Michael J. Lostumbo and others write that these weapons and others like
them "could cripple an airbase, incapacitate an aircraft carrier, and
devastate concentrated ground forces." 65Granted, the tripwire effect of
U.S. forward bases, along with the fact that U.S. allies benefit from
these capabilities as well, means that deterrence remains robust in
Asia. Still, [Chinese strategic planners have discussed striking U.S.
bases in the unlikely scenario that inadvertent escalation results in an
outbreak of conflict]{.underline}. 66 In other words, **[bases offer
only a marginal increase in deterrence at added risk to forward-deployed
troops.]{.underline}** Another major strategic problem with a
forward-deployed military posture is that it can sometimes have the
opposite of its intended effect. **[Stationing military bases near an
adversary can cause fear that generates counteraction instead of scaring
an adversary into submission]{.underline}**. 67 [The most intense crisis
of the Cold War period may have had its origins in such a
dilemma]{.underline}. In June 1961, the [Kennedy]{.underline}
administration [placed Jupiter ballistic missiles in Turkey, bordering
the Soviet Union]{.underline}. It was partly [in response to that
decision]{.underline} that [the Soviet Union decided to place its own
missiles in Cuba]{.underline}, precipitating a dangerous crisis between
the nuclear powers in October of that year. 68 Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev reportedly called the deployment of Jupiter missiles "an
intolerable provocation" and told his ambassador to Cuba, "Inasmuch as
the Americans already have surrounded the Soviet Union with a circle of
their military bases and missile installations of various designations,
we should repay them in kind, let them try their own medicine." 69
Today, [the U.S. military presence in Europe]{.underline} [is
tasked]{.underline}, in part, [with deterring Russian military
aggression]{.underline}. And on those recent occasions in which Russia
has acted out militarily, as it did against Georgia in 2008 on the side
of separatists in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and in Ukraine in 2014,
[advocates of a forward posture blame the incursions on a lack of
deterrence or diminished American credibility.]{.underline} But
[Russia's interventions in Georgia and Ukraine derive more from Moscow's
insecurities about]{.underline} the [expansion of U.S]{.underline}.-led
Western economic and military institutions into former Soviet republics,
and even [up to the Russian border, than from insufficient U.S. military
presence]{.underline} in Eastern Europe. 70 Post-Cold War NATO expansion
is the source of profound anxiety and lingering resentment in Moscow. 71
Following Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea, the Russian leader
decried NATO expansion as an attempt at containment, and, when in 2015
NATO invited Montenegro to be the newest member of the alliance, [the
Kremlin warned that further expansion eastward "cannot but result in
retaliatory actions]{.underline}." 72 One could say that **[forward
deployment contributes to the insecurity it purports to
prevent.]{.underline} [Bases can also motivate nearby adversaries to
pursue nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. [Iran's expansion of nuclear
enrichment]{.underline} in the run-up to the recent nuclear deal between
Iran, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and
Germany, for example, [was]{.underline} likely understood by many in
Tehran as [a measure of protection from the United States.]{.underline}
[After all, the United States habitually intervenes in the
region]{.underline}, is allied with Iran's two most vociferous enemies
(Israel and Saudi Arabia), [and has carried out regime
change]{.underline} and years of military occupation [in the countries
on Iran's immediate east and west]{.underline} flanks. In addition,
while bases in Japan and South Korea have arguably helped dissuade these
countries from developing nuclear weapons, the U.S. presence creates
pressure for North Korea to do so[.]{.underline} [Pyongyang's efforts to
secure a deliverable nuclear weapon may be]{.underline} partly
[motivated by]{.underline} a desire for the prestige associated with
such capabilities, but [fear of U.S. military power in South Korea, and
a desire to deter an attack by either or both countries]{.underline},
are also significant motivators. [Proximate U.S. military
forces]{.underline} and an adversarial relationship with Washington
[helped motivate China's 1964 acquisition of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} 73 And, in recent years, U.S. actions in Iraq and
Libya have signaled to potential rogue states the wisdom, rather than
the danger, of obtaining a nuclear deterrent, or at least maintaining a
threshold breakout capability. 74 **[Entanglement is another
risk]{.underline}** exacerbated by the attempt to reassure allies with
overseas bases. 75 [If U.S. troops are stationed abroad to demonstrate
credibility, and then the United States refuses to intervene in the
event of conflict, U.S. policymakers will suffer political
costs]{.underline}, even if the circumstances do not involve vital U.S.
interests. Much academic literature has questioned the need to take
military action solely for the sake of credibility. 76 But [the presence
of military bases in or near a conflict zone can intensify calls to
intervene to satisfy credibility concerns, thus making entanglement more
likely]{.underline}. [Allies can entrap a security patron into war with
their rivals by pursuing high-risk strategies. U.S. military presence
can encourage this moral hazard, sometimes called "reckless
driving."]{.underline} 77 [Current U.S. posture is plagued by plausible
scenarios of entrapment in its commitments to Taiwan, Japan, and the
Philippines over territorial and maritime sovereignty disputes with
China.]{.underline} In 2012, the Philippines engaged in an intense and
potentially dangerous two-month naval standoff with China, a much more
capable military power, over the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South
China Sea. Heightened nationalist sentiments certainly played a role in
the quarrel, but the unequal power dynamics between the two states
raises reasonable questions about whether the relatively weak
Philippines was emboldened to challenge a much stronger China because of
the United States' security guarantee and nearby military bases. [That
kind of moral hazard is a liability that could pull the United States
into conflicts unconnected to its direct security and economic
interests.]{.underline} Fundamentally, [moral hazard]{.underline} is a
function of the commitment, but it [is exacerbated by the physical
presence of bases and troops.]{.underline}

### AT: Transition Wars

#### No transition war -- states respond to relative decline with prompt and peaceful retrenchment -- [empirics]{.underline}

How do great powers respond to relative decline? [Since Thucydides, the
consensus is that great power transitions are particularly
perilous]{.underline}. 1 Intoxicated by their newfound capability,
rising powers work to undermine and overturn the existing order.
Nationalist politicians rail against past humiliations and hunger for
future glories. Rising states feel they are claiming their birthrights
while declining states feel they are being stripped of theirs.
[Frightened]{.underline} [by]{.underline} their [loss of infl
uence]{.underline}---and the looming specter of worse to
come---[declining powers threaten force to sustain the status
quo]{.underline}. Diplomacy breaks down because neither side trusts that
agreements will be honored. Alliances cease to deter as weak states fl
ock to aggressors. Domestic dysfunction compounds matters as parties
polarize, special interests dig in, and foreign policy whipsaws or
stalemates[. The results are disastrous: vicious infi ghting, gridlocked
politics, pointless diplomacy, escalating crises, desperate decisions,
and, ultimately, war.]{.underline} In politics as in nature, eclipses
are spectacularly dark times. If the underlying problem during relative
decline is that states try to maintain or expand their ambitions with
dwindling resources, the solution could be curtailing ends to match the
available means. But **[the conventional wisdom is that retrenchment

INTRODUCTION 2 in adversaries. Disengagement destabilizes regions,
creating cracks that split the international order. Domestically,
alarmed lobbyists will mobilize to defend parochial benefi ts, while
hardliners will equate retreat with defeat and brand advocates of
retrenchment as naive appeasers. Rather than renewing investment at
home, policymakers will increase military spending to keep up. 2 Bluff
and bluster will trump diplomacy, provocation will substitute for
deterrence, and preventive war now appears preferable to inexorable
defeat later. In this book, we argue that **[the conventional wisdom is
wrong]{.underline}**. Specifi - cally, we make three main arguments.
[**First, relative decline causes prompt, proportionate
retrenchment**]{.underline} because states seek strategic solvency. [The
international system is a competitive place, and great powers did not
get to the top by being imprudent, irrational, or
irresponsible]{.underline}. When their fortunes ebb, states tend to
retain the virtues that made them great. [In the face of decline, great
powers have a good sense of their relative capability]{.underline} and
tend not to give away more than they must. [Expanding or maintaining
grand strategic ambitions during decline incurs unsustainable
burdens]{.underline} and incites unwinnable fi ghts, so the faster
states fall, the more they retrench. Great powers may choose to retrench
in other circumstances as well, but they have an overriding incentive to
do so when confronted by relative decline. **[Second, the depth of
relative decline shapes]{.underline}** not only how much a state
retrenches, but also **[which policies it adopts.]{.underline}** [The
world is complex and cutthroat;]{.underline} leaders cannot glibly pull
a policy off the shelf and expect desired outcomes. Because
international politics is a self-help system, [great powers prefer
policies that rely less on the actions of allies and
adversaries]{.underline}. For lack of a better term, [we refer to these
as domestic policies,]{.underline} which include [reducing spending,
restructuring forces, and reforming institutions]{.underline}---[all to
reallocate resources for more effi cient uses]{.underline}. But
international policies may also help, and they include redeploying
forces, defusing fl ashpoints, and redistributing burdens---all to avoid
costly confl icts and reinforce core strongpoints. **[The faster and
deeper states fall, the more they are willing to rely on others to
cushion their fall.]{.underline}** Retrenchment is not a weapon but an
arsenal that can be used in different amounts and combinations depending
on conditions and the enemies faced. [Third,]{.underline} after depth,
[structural conditions are the most important factors shaping how great
powers respond to relative decline.]{.underline} Four conditions
catalyze the incentives for declining states to retrench. [One is the
declining state's rank. States in the top rungs]{.underline} of the
great power hierarchy [have more resources and margin for
error]{.underline} than those lower down, [so there is less urgency for
them to retrench.]{.underline} [Another is the availability of
allies.]{.underline} [Where states can shift burdens to capable regional
powers]{.underline} with similar preferences, [retrenchment is less
risky]{.underline} and diffi cult. [Yet another is]{.underline} the This

[interdependence]{.underline} of commitments. When states perceive
commitments in one place as tightly linked to commitments elsewhere,
pulling back becomes harder and less likely. [The last catalyst is the
calculus of conquest. If aggression pays, then retrenchment does not,
and great powers will be loath to do it.]{.underline} The world is not
just complex and cutthroat, it is also dynamic. No set of conditions is
everlasting, and leaders must change with the times. Empirically, this
work aims to add value by being the fi rst to study systematically all
modern shifts in the great power pecking order. **[We find sixteen cases
of relative decline since 1870,]{.underline}** when reliable data for
the great powers become available, and compare them to their
non-declining counterparts across a variety of measures. To preview the
fi ndings, **[retrenchment is by far the most common response to
relative decline,]{.underline}** and declining powers behave differently
from non-declining powers. [States in decline are more likely to cut the
size of their military forces and budgets and]{.underline} in extreme
cases [are more likely to form alliances.]{.underline} [This does
not,]{.underline} however[, make them ripe for
exploitation;]{.underline} declining states perform comparatively well
in militarized disputes. Our headline fi nding, however, is that
[**states that retrench recover their prior rank with some regularity,
but those that fail to retrench never do.** These results]{.underline}
challenge theories of grand strategy and war, offer guidance to
policymakers, and [indicate overlooked paths to peace.]{.underline}

[President Donald Trump showed]{.underline} during last week's Group of
20 meeting in Osaka, Japan what he meant by repeated off-the-cuff
[remarks that he wanted to build good relations with Russia and
China.]{.underline} He had an apparently friendly and wide-ranging
discussion with Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Friday. [The two
leaders agreed that American and Russian officials would continue their
consultations about global and regional issues, and **ways of improving
and expanding bilateral political and economic ties.** That was followed
Saturday by Trump's meeting with China's President Xi Jinping who --- in
a dig at the U.S. --- extolled multilateralism and sharply criticized
trade protectionism]{.underline} in his opening remarks to the G-20
plenary session. [**Xi reiterated those views by saying that he wanted
cooperation rather than "friction and confrontation."** Eventually, the
Trump-Xi meeting ended up on a conciliatory note]{.underline}.
Additional trade tariffs will be put to the side, and the [two
countries' negotiating teams will pick up where they left off when trade
talks were interrupted a month ago.]{.underline} An olive branch to
China Ignoring complaints of American companies about discriminatory
treatment in China, [Xi also asked that the Chinese businesses should be
treated fairly by U.S. authorities. Trump obliged by allowing American
firms to sell technology to Chinese telecom giant Huawei]{.underline} in
areas that were not critical to national security. What does that all
mean? First and foremost, it signals **[the beginning of Trump's firm
focus on his reelection campaign, where a scuffle, or worse, with Russia
and China would be a devastating event and leave him as a one-term
player]{.underline}** --- even in the context of a rather uninspiring
lineup of Democratic competitors. [Calming things down with two
countries branded by Washington as strategic competitors hell-bent on
undermining America's world order is a priority]{.underline} --- "for
now," as Trump likes to say. And, as he also would say, "we shall see
later," presumably after his reelection. Will that fly as a feasible
election strategy? Yes it will, because, as said earlier**[, Trump
correctly sees that picking a fight with Russia and China is an
existential threat to humanity Americans and the rest of the world would
not support.]{.underline}** So, [Trump looks for peaceful and negotiated
solutions with Russia in Syria, Ukraine and Venezuela, with a carrot for
Moscow in opening up huge opportunities for American businesses eager to
expand their operations in the country's investment-starved enormous
territories]{.underline}. In fact, the American business delegation was
one of the largest at the recent economic forum in St. Petersburg,
Russia. [Moscow's allegedly key policy influence within the OPEC oil
cartel is also seen as a precious help in holding energy prices down,
and staying the Federal Reserve's hand in hiking interest rates to
forestall energy-driven inflation pressures.]{.underline} Trump assist
for Japan's winner [Iran is another issue where Russia has a helpful
hand. That's in sharp contrast with America's closest allies --- the
United Kingdom, France and Germany --- who not only publicly disagree
with the U.S. on Iran, but also actively oppose Washington's Iran
sanctions]{.underline} and have established a special payment facility
to do business with Tehran. China is an entirely different problem.
While Russia could be an irritant in some global issues and in managing
Europe's centuries-old hatreds, **[China is already a very credible
challenge to American world order --- seriously undermining Washington's
increasingly unstable trans-Atlantic and Asian alliances.]{.underline}**
Some observers have already determined that Trump lost last week in his
trade and security confrontation with China. That is a hasty,
thoughtless and unworthy assessment. It is true, however, that [Trump's
trade armistice with China was dictated by his domestic considerations.
It is also true that Trump appeared to be scaling back his ill-advised
political overreac]{.underline}h under the guise of his unassailable
trade case against China. The bottom line, again, **[for now, is that
Trump will have to settle for China's commitment to cut its American
trade surpluses, but he definitely has to forget about interfering in
China's legislative process and economic policies]{.underline}** --
hot-button issues that China calls "issues of principle." Trump wasted
two-and-a-half years and \$1 trillion of American money (rising trade
deficits with China) in pursuit of political objectives that he should
have known China would never accept. Whoever pushed Trump in that
direction deserves his signature "You're fired!" scream. But Japan's
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe deserves kudos. He is a winner and a happy
man: Trump pushed China into his lap. Abe, as a result, should be the
first to thank Trump for making Japan's impossible dream come true. Xi,
who looked like he was holding his nose during years of photo ops with
Abe, last week accepted an invitation to pay a state visit to Japan next
spring. Let's see now how Trump manages Japan, its huge and systematic
annual trade surpluses of about \$70 billion on American trades, and
Washington's irrevocable obligation to unconditionally defend what is
still called America's key Asian ally. Putting it all together and
lifting the sights from here and now, **[Trump may have started a
process of enduring world peace]{.underline}**. [That concept is based
on the idea that the U.S., Russia and China have been staring for years
at an underlying security architecture of a uniquely binary choice: The
end of humanity, or a new, hopefully American, world order built around
those three key players whose economic and civilizational interests call
for peaceful co-existence.]{.underline} Investment thoughts [Trump has
begun a process with Russia and China during last week's G-20 meeting
that could bring lasting peace and economic prosperity to the world.
**His geopolitical moves may have been mainly motivated by his
reelection strategy, but they have an enormous potential for creating a
new world order based on the foundations enshrined in America's inspired
and written United Nations charter.**]{.underline} China would make a
fateful mistake by refusing to grasp the olive branch offered by the
U.S. last week. Triumphalist hints in Chinese official media don't augur
well, but let's hope that a more realistic and constructive thinking
will prevail. [The world economy is now facing brighter prospects,
although the U.S. failed to force large and systematic trade surplus
countries to drive an upswing of the global business cycle]{.underline}.
As always, Washington will have to do the heavy lifting for those
beggar-thy-neighbor countries --- only to be perversely criticized for
violating the multilateral trading system.

### Offshore Balancing Good -- Generic

#### Offshore balancing maintains world security without the risk of forward deployment. Rather than complete withdrawal from Europe and the Middle East, the US maintains promotes regional security agreements to prioritize developing a more secure Asia.

REALISM IN PRACTICE [Four presidents have now pursued a grand strategy
built around the goal of American hegemony, and all four have fared
poorly.]{.underline} As the political scientist John Mearsheimer and I
have argued previously in these pages, **[it is time for the United
States to return to its traditional approach of offshore
balancing.]{.underline}** This strategy begins by recognizing that [the
United States remains the most secure power]{.underline} in modern
history. [It has thousands of nuclear weapons and powerful conventional
forces]{.underline}, and it faces no serious rivals in the Western
Hemisphere. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans still insulate the country
from many threats, giving U.S. leaders enormous latitude in choosing
where and when to fight. In addition to working to maintain U.S.
hegemony in the Western Hemisphere, American policymakers have long
sought to prevent other great powers from imitating the United States by
dominating their own regions. [A peer competitor with no serious rivals
nearby would be free to project power around the world-as Washington has
for decades]{.underline}. From an American perspective, **[it is better
if the major powers in Eurasia have to keep a wary eye on one another,
making it harder for them to interfere near American
shores]{.underline}**. [The United States intervened]{.underline} in the
world wars to prevent Wilhelmine Germany, Nazi Germany, and imperial
Japan from dominating Europe and Asia. [This same principle
inspired]{.underline} the Cold War strategy of
[containment,]{.underline} although in that case, the United States
could not pass the buck and had to bear most of the costs itself.
**[Today, there is no potential regional hegemon in Europe, whose states
should gradually take full responsibility for their own
defense.]{.underline}** The countries of [the European
Union]{.underline} are [home to more than 500 million people and boast a
combined annual gdp exceeding \$17 trillion]{.underline}, **[whereas
Russia-the main external threat to eu states-has a population of just
144 million and an annual gdp of only \$1.6 trillion. Moreover, nato\'s
European members together annually spend more than three times what
Russia does on defense.]{.underline}** [The idea that the
eu]{.underline} (whose roster includes two nuclear-armed powers) [lacks
the wherewithal to defend itself against a neighbor whose economy is
smaller than Italy\'s is risible.]{.underline} Nato still has ardent
defenders on both sides of the Atlantic, but they are living in the
past. The alliance played an invaluable role in containing the Soviet
Union and preventing the return of an aggressive, expansionist Germany.
But the Soviet Union is long gone, and Germany is now a liberal
democracy firmly committed to the status quo. [Nato\'s leaders have
worked overtime to devise new missions since the Berlin Wall came down,
but the alliance\'s attempts at nation building in the Balkans,
Afghanistan, and Libya have not gone well.]{.underline} Unless nato\'s
European members decide to back a U.S.-led effort to balance against
China (and it is not clear that they will or should), **[it is time for
the United States to gradually disengage from nato and turn European
security over to the Europeans by beginning a coordinated withdrawal of
U.S. military forces from Europe]{.underline}**, allowing a European
officer to serve as nato\'s supreme allied commander, [and making it
clear that the United States will no longer be Europe\'s first line of
defense.]{.underline} Washington should take these steps not with rancor
or resentment but with a sense of accomplishment [**and a commitment to
cooperate on issues on which American and European interests align, such
as climate change, counterterrorism, and the management of the world
economy.** Washington should also return to its traditional approach to
the Middle East]{.underline}. To ensure access to the energy supplies on
which the world economy depends, the United States has long sought to
prevent any country from dominating the oil-rich Persian Gulf. But until
the late 1960s, it did so by relying on the United Kingdom. After the
British withdrew, [Washington relied on regional clients, such as Iran,
Israel, and Saudi Arabia. U.S. forces stayed offshore until January
1991]{.underline}, a few months after Saddam Hussein, the leader of
Iraq, seized Kuwait. In response, the George H. W. Bush administration
assembled a coalition of states that liberated Kuwait, decimated Iraq\'s
military, and restored balance to the region. Today, [Washington\'s
primary goal in the Middle East remains preventing any country from
impeding the flow of oil to world markets]{.underline}. The region is
now deeply divided along several dimensions, with no state in a position
to dominate. Moreover, [the oil-producing states depend on revenue from
energy exports, which makes all of them eager to sell. **Maintaining a
regional balance of power should be relatively easy, therefore,
especially once the United States ends its counterproductive efforts to
remake local politics**. U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria would be
withdrawn, although the United States might still maintain
intelligence-gathering facilities, prepositioned equipment, and basing
arrangements in the region as a hedge against the need to return in the
future.]{.underline} But as it did from 1945 to 1991, **[Washington
would count on local powers to maintain a regional balance of power in
accordance with their own interests]{.underline}**. [As an offshore
balancer, the United States would establish normal relations with all
countries in the region]{.underline}, instead of having \"special
relationships\" with a few states and profoundly hostile relations with
others. [No country in the Middle East is so virtuous or vital that it
deserves unconditional U.S. suppo]{.underline}rt, and no country there
is so heinous that it must be treated as a pariah. The United States
should act as China, India, Japan, Russia, and the eu do, maintaining
normal working relationships with all states in the region-including
Iran. Among other things, **[this policy would encourage rival regional
powers to compete for U.S. support, instead of taking it for
granted.]{.underline}** For the moment, Washington should also make it
clear that it will reduce its support for local partners if they
repeatedly act in ways that undermine U.S. interests or that run
contrary to core U.S. values. [Should any state threaten to dominate the
region from within or without in the future, the United States would
help the rest balance against it, calibrating its level of effort and
local presence to the magnitude of the danger.]{.underline} With its
relationships with Europe and the Middle East right-sized and
rationalized, **[an offshore-balancing United States could focus
primarily on the country that is its only potential peer competitor and
the world\'s only other would-be regional hegemon: China.]{.underline}**
If China\'s power continues to grow, it is likely to press its neighbors
to distance themselves from Washington and accept China as the dominant
power in the Asia-Pacific. Were China to become a regional hegemon in
Asia, it would be better positioned to project power around the world
and extend its influence into the Western Hemisphere. [To counter this
possibility, the United States should maintain and deepen its current
security ties with Australia, Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea
and continue to nurture its strategic partnerships with India,
Singapore, and Vietnam.]{.underline} Once the United States is no longer
subsidizing its wealthy European allies or squandering trillions of
dollars on costly quagmires in the greater Middle East, it can more
readily afford the military capabilities needed to balance China.
Maintaining an effective Asian coalition will not be easy, however.
[Washington\'s Asian allies are separated from one another by water and
vast distances, and they are reluctant to jeopardize their commercial
ties with China]{.underline}. The relationship between Japan and South
Korea has a troubled history that makes close cooperation difficult.
Local powers will be tempted to let Washington do most of the work, and
sophisticated U.S. leadership will be necessary to hold this coalition
together and ensure that each member contributes its fair share.
Trump\'s missteps abandoning the Trans-Pacific Partnership, starting
trade disputes with Japan and South Korea, and indulging in an
amateurish flirtation with North Korea-have not helped. Defenders of the
status quo will no doubt mischaracterize this course of action as a
return to isolationism. That is nonsense. [As an offshore balancer, the
United States would be deeply engaged diplomatically, economically, and,
in some areas, militarily]{.underline}. It would still possess the
world\'s mightiest armed forces, even if it spent somewhat less money on
them. **[The United States would continue to work with other countries
to address major global issues such as climate change, terrorism, and
cyberthreats]{.underline}**. [But Washington would no longer assume
primary responsibility for defending wealthy allies that can defend
themselves]{.underline}, no longer subsidize client states whose actions
undermine U.S. interests, and no longer try to spread democracy via
regime change, covert action, or economic pressure. [Instead, Washington
would use its strength primarily to uphold the balance of power in
Asia-where a substantial U.S. presence]{.underline} is still needed-and
would devote more time, attention, and resources to restoring the
foundations of U.S. power at home. **[By setting an example that others
would once again admire and seek to emulate, an offshorebalancing United
States would also do a better job of promoting the political values that
Americans espouse.]{.underline}** This approach would also involve less
reliance on force and coercion and a renewed emphasis on diplomacy.
[Military power would remain central to U.S. national security, but its
use would be as a last resort rather than a first impulse]{.underline}.
It is worth remembering that some of Washington\'s greatest foreign
policy achievements- [the Marshall Plan, the Bretton Woods system, the
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, and the peaceful reunification of
Germany-were diplomatic victories, not battlefield ones.]{.underline} In
recent years, however, both Democratic and Republican administrations
have tended to eschew genuine diplomacy and have relied instead on
ultimatums and pressure. Convinced they hold all the high cards, too
many U.S. officials have come to see even modest concessions to
opponents as tantamount to surrender. So [they have tried to dictate
terms to others and have reached for sanctions or the sword when the
target state has refused to comply.]{.underline} But even weak states
are reluctant to submit to blackmail, and imposing one-sided agreements
on others makes them more likely to cheat or renege as soon as they can.
**[For diplomacy to work, both sides must get some of what they
want.]{.underline}** Moreover, offshore balancing requires a
sophisticated understanding of regional politics, which only
knowledgeable diplomats and area specialists can provide. [In
particular, creating an effective coalition to check China\'s ambitions
in Asia will be as much a diplomatic task as a military
mission]{.underline}, **[and success would depend on a deep bench of
officials who are intimately familiar with the history, languages,
cultures, and sensitivities of the region.]{.underline}** A return to
offshore balancing should also be accompanied by a major effort to
rebuild and professionalize the U.S. diplomatic corps. [Ambassadorships
should be reserved for qualified diplomats rather than vips or campaign
donors, and the State Department must develop, refine, and update its
diplomatic doctrine-the ways the United States can use noncoercive means
of influence]{.underline}-much as the armed services continually refine
the military doctrines that guide their conduct in war. [The ranks of
the Foreign Service should be significantly increased, and as their
careers advance, career diplomats should receive the same opportunities
for professional education that senior military officers currently
enjoy.]{.underline}

### Offshore Balancing Good -- Asia -- India

#### India is the lynchpin of US offshore balancing in Asia. The US and India have mutual interests in containing Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region and possess the military and strategic capability of checking rising hegemons.

University, Bangalore Obama's pivot to Asia: Forging a strong bilateral
relationship with India [The declaration of a "US pivot to Asia" in 2011
by the Obama administration was a major change in US policy toward
Asia]{.underline}. Through the pivot or the "rebalancing," the
[Obama]{.underline} administration **[tried to forge new partnerships in
the region which include India, Indonesia, and Vietnam]{.underline}**.38
With the growing challenge from China in mind, the Obama administration
**[clearly indicated the US intention to invest in a "long-term
strategic partnership" with India]{.underline}** so that [New Delhi
might serve as a "regional economic anchor and provider of security in
the broader Indian Ocean region]{.underline}." 39 The Obama
administration clearly expressed its desire to prop-up India as a
regional counterweight to China in Asia.40 After initial reluctance to
endorse the pivot, [New Delhi has gradually embraced the idea, given the
nature of China's intentions to encircle India in the Indian
Ocean]{.underline} and US readiness to recognize India's strategic
positioning in the Indo--Pacific region. In its new maritime strategy of
2015, [the US deliberately used the term Indo--Asia--Pacific instead of
the traditional "Asia-Pacific]{.underline}" and "recognized the
Indo--Asia--Pacific as a single geopolitical theater with multiple
centers of gravity and regional leaders" where India was placed squarely
in the "center of that strategy." 41 Given the context [of China's
increasing assertiveness in various territorial disputes, its ambitions
to emerge as a great power in Asia, and its naval expansionism in the
Indian Ocean region,]{.underline} a synergy of interest has emerged
between the US and India in the twenty-first century. **[The US had
initially considered India along with Japan and Australia to help
promote its interest in Asia strategically and
militarily.]{.underline}** Strategically, it expected India to join the
balancing mechanism against China along with other allies and partners
which considered China threat to their security. However, India was
reluctant to participate in a US led alliance mechanism because that
would be perceived as anti-China. As its largest neighbor and a superior
power in terms of both traditional and nuclear war capability, New Delhi
does not want to view China as a permanent enemy in its backyard.
Considering the dissent articulated by China in 2007, India was even
reluctant to include Japan in the Malabar exercise until 2015.42
Similarly [New Delhi]{.underline} was apprehensive about Japanese Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe's "Security Diamond" concept of 2012,43 as it would
be considered anti-China, but [grabbed the opportunity to become an
active participant in the new "Quadrilateral Dialog" mechanism because
of China's aggressive expansionist tendencies in the Indian
Ocean]{.underline}.44 **[India has shown growing interest in building
bilateral partnerships with the US.]{.underline}** The
[Obama]{.underline} administration [elevated bilateral
cooperation]{.underline} to the next level, [adding an economic
advantage to the strategic cooperation]{.underline} for both countries.
For any defense or strategic cooperation to sustain for long, it has to
generate economic benefits for both partners in the form of trade in
military hardware and technology cooperation, including the joint
development of systems. For instance, a major factor behind the success
of Indo-- Russian strategic relations is the trade in military hardware,
as India is the largest importer of arms from Russia. Similarly, [in
Indo--US relations, India seeks greater technological collaboration
rather than a mere buy-and-sell type of relationship with the
US]{.underline}. The Obama administration understood India's reluctance
to enter into a formal alliance with the US, but wanted to strengthen
defense technology cooperation while continuing its "strategic autonomy"
policy. **[In this pursuit, the US and India signed a Defense Trade and
Technology Initiative]{.underline}** (DTTI) agreement in 2012 [aimed at
strengthening cooperation in research, co-production, and co-development
of capabilities needed for sustaining and modernizing India military
forces]{.underline}. Under this initiative four "pathfinder projects"
were identified: next generation Raven Minis UAVs, roll-on and roll- off
kits for C-130s, mobile electric hybrid power sources, and Uniform
Integrated Protection Ensemble Increment-2; and, [the two countries have
agreed to the joint production of fighter aircrafts by Lockheed Martin
and Boeing]{.underline}.45 In fact, in the early stages of his
presidency President [Obama]{.underline} did not consider China an enemy
and sought better engagement with Beijing. He [pursued a policy of "deep
engagement" with China and a "military restraint" strategy toward the
Asia-Pacific region]{.underline}. His objective was to make China a
responsible stakeholder in the international system and to promote
"winwin cooperation" between the two countries.46 An almost decade-long
war on terror and the economic crisis of 2008 placed great economic
stress on the US and hampered its ability to maintain its military
preponderance or even compete with China in Asia. President Obama
responded to this with his initiative of a "new type of great power
relations" between China and the US in the creation of the G-2 (Group of
Two), with greater economic interaction including a massive purchase by
China of US Treasury bonds, expansion of the US-China Economic and
Strategic Dialog, and negotiations for a USChina bilateral investment
treaty (BIT) that induced an unprecedented level of economic integration
between the two countries. Conversely, [China utilized the international
environment to its advantage and became a more assertive power in the
region]{.underline}. China's continued support for the US-led war on
terror had minimized US focus on allegations of human rights violations
in China and its military modernization. During this time, the Chinese
economy continued its steady growth and the country overtook the US as
the largest economy in 2014. Taking cognizance of the upcoming challenge
in Asia from an economically strong and militarily powerful China,
President Obama responded with his strategic "pivot to Asia," announced
by his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the ASEAN Regional Forum in
Hanoi on July 23, 2010, which was aimed at containing China. [The chief
component of the "pivot," and later the "rebalancing," was to deploy 60
percent of the US Navy and Air Force in the Asia-Pacific region
vis-à-vis the Atlantic]{.underline}, and create an economic grouping
called the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) comprising 12 countries from
the Pacific belt, excluding China. [China responded to the rebalancing
with more aggressive tactics by creating a rival regional economic
groupings called]{.underline} the Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership ([RECP)]{.underline} and the Free Trade Area of the
Asia-Pacific ([FTAAP), as well as]{.underline} introducing its "[One
Belt, One Road]{.underline}" initiative, [and]{.underline} leading the
creation of the [BRICS Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure
Investment Ban]{.underline}k.47 **[As a result, the US pivot was not
able to contain China, nor did China become the fully "responsible"
global power that the US had visualized.]{.underline}** The Obama
administration could not continue the pace of the pivot because of its
domestic economic constraints. This resulted in Beijing taking a more
assertive position in staking claims in the East China and South China
seas and reacting more sharply to the assertion of claims by others.
President Obama's Air-Sea Battle doctrine deemed to counter China's
A2/AD did not become operationally successful and had to be abandoned.48
The introduction of a "sequestration" policy in 2012, which lowered US
defense spending by 10 percent (in 2013) to 8.5 percent (in 2021), a
total of \$454 billion over a period of ten years, compounded the
problem further.49 Additionally, the US could not stop China's rise.
President Obama's second term had a major shift in policy toward Asia.
China became more assertive under President Xi Jinping's leadership
after a smooth transition of power at the top. [The number of skirmishes
between China and its neighboring countries increased, with its
declaration of an air defense identification zone in the East China
Sea]{.underline}, its expansion of Tree Island and North Island in the
Paracels, as well as building of artificial islands in the South China
Sea, [turning them into military and logistical bases]{.underline}.50
However, the US is not in a position to intervene in all these disputes
unless they directly threaten US interests in the region. **[As a
result, the Obama administration started building stronger military,
diplomatic, and economic ties with allies and other regional partners,
although it did not explicitly convey its intentions to contain
China]{.underline}**.51 In fact, the Obama administration made a
concerted effort to expand the concept of Asia-Pacific to include the
Indian Ocean, in order to include in India in its rebalancing strategy,
without which, it realized, rebalancing would not be successful.52 India
was also looking to balance China in collaboration with the US. [A major
aspect in the relationship is that the Obama administration sought to
institutionalize US' strategic relationship with India and ensured
bipartisan consensus]{.underline} in the American Congress for
India-specific defense-related agreements. **[The DTTI was a major step
in this direction and enabled defense cooperation and collaboration for
the joint production and transfer of technology]{.underline}**.
Considering the importance of India in the US calculation of a security
order in Asia, [the US signed a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of
Agreement (LEMOA) with India in August 2016]{.underline}. Indeed, the
LEMOA is an India-specific pact and differs from the text of the
original Logistic Support Agreements (LSAs), which the US has signed
with more than 60 countries[. It took a decade to sign this major
customized agreement, as discussions on the pact had started in 2003,
and it was one of the three "foundational pacts" that the US wanted
India to sign]{.underline}: the Logistic Support Agreement (LSA), the
Communications Interoperability & Security Memorandum of Agreement
(CISMOA), and the Basic Exchange & Cooperation Agreement on geo-spatial
services (BECA) for defense technology cooperation. Former US Defense
Secretary Ashton Carter noted after the signing of the LEMOA that this
kind of agreement "[we do only with our closest and most long-standing
allies. That's a very big change]{.underline}. ...... It's an enormous
change from 50 years of US history." 53 Indeed, the LEMO Agreement
propelled New Delhi autonomy. [It allowed both nations to use their
military facilities in times of crises and in peace-time
operations]{.underline}, with the larger goal of enhancing
interoperability. Similarly, the US' National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA) 2017 incorporated a specific India clause, which was approved by
the House of Representative in May 2016 and the Senate in December 2016,
which brought India on par with its NATO allies in terms of the sale of
defense equipment and technology transfer.54 Section 1292 of the [NDAA
mandated the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to recognize
India as a "Major Defense Partner]{.underline}" of the US; to designate
an individual within the executive branch to supervise the
implementation of the Framework for the U.S.--India Defense Relationship
and help resolve remaining issues impeding defense trade, security
cooperation, and co-production and co-development opportunities; and to
approve and facilitate the transfer of advanced technology, consistent
with the US' conventional arms transfer policy.55 [If a strategic
relationship needs to be strengthened, it must be supported by economic
dividends]{.underline}. The Indo--US arms trade deal made enormous
progress during President Obama's tenure and at one stage the US had
become the largest exporter of arms to India. India's arms purchases
from the US during 2001--4 was merely \$400 million which expanded to
\$3.2 billion during the 2005--8 period (see Table 1).56 After the
nuclear deal was signed and after President Obama came to power in 2008,
there has been significant improvement in defense dealings between the
two countries: [bilateral defense trade increased to \$5.74 billion in
2013, to \$12 billion in 2014, and by the time President Obama left
office it was over \$14 billion.57]{.underline} After Prime Minister
Narendra Modi came to power, [the Indian government signed another deal
for \$2.5 billion for US-made Boeing CH-47 Chinook and Boeing AH-64
Apache helicopters in 2015.58]{.underline} In 2015, the Indian
government approved a \$3-billion deal for Boeing's 22 Apache attack
choppers and 15 Chinook cargo choppers; the Chinooks will be bought
directly from Boeing, while the Apache contract would take place through
the foreign militarysales procedure.59 In total \$8.3 billion worth of
arms purchase agreements have been signed between the two countries.60
India became the second-biggest buyer of US arms after Saudi Arabia and
the US even replaced Russia as the largest arms exporter to India during
the 2011--14 period.61 India has purchased more than \$15 billion in US
defense equipment in the past decade and plans to spend over \$150
billion over the next ten to fifteen years, a significant portion on US
equipment.62 **[The Trump administration continues the previous
administration's policy of a strategic partnership with
India]{.underline}** and is ready to accommodate India's desire to waive
over the two foundation pacts: -- [the Communication and Information
Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA) and the Basic Exchange and
Cooperation Agreement (BECA]{.underline}) -- which would enable the
transfer of critical defense technologies to India as well as the trade
in arms, by waiving these pacts. In the National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA) 2018 for the 2018--19 fiscal period, the [Trump
administration proposed an "advance defense cooperation with India,"
which includes joint exercises, operations, and patrols and mutual
defense planning,]{.underline} a step ahead of the NDAA-2017.63 The
Trump administration is considering supplying armed drones for the
Indian Air Force and sophisticated Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch
Systems (EMALS) for the Indian Navy's future aircraft carriers; the
former will help India counter cross-border terrorism from Pakistan,
[while the latter is required for India's third aircraft carrier being
built indigenously at Cochin Shipyard.]{.underline} It is a major
development in Indo--US relations, as India can now cooperate with US
defense contractors without signing the two basic pacts. Earlier, India
was noncommittal to sign customized agreements and sought "special
treatment" from the US, which the US Senate could not easily agree to.
[The Trump administration said that the President "strongly supports"
the sale of F-18 and F-16 fighter jets to India]{.underline} and
asserted that the proposals have the potential to take Indo--US defense
ties to the next level.64 Washington expressed its desires to sell India
Boeing's F/A-18E/F aircrafts and is ready to set up a plant to build the
fighter in India; it expect bilateral defense trade to reach \$18--25
billion from the current \$15--18 billion.65 The Trump administration
accords high priority to its relationship with India as a "Major Defense
Partner" and is ready to expand its existing defense and security
cooperation further.66 More importantly, it provides "support to India's
leadership role in Indian Ocean security and throughout the broader
region," 67 which is a clear indication of the US offshore balancing
strategy in Trump's Indo--Pacific strategy. "Act-east" converges with
the "pivot" **[There has been a convergence of the interests of India
and the US in recent times with regard to the security situation in the
Indo--Pacific]{.underline}**. The two countries have identified
"maritime security as a key area of cooperation" in the coming decades,
in the 2016 joint statement.68 Maritime cooperation between the two
countries began in 1992 when they launched the Malabar series of naval
exercise, and has now become trilateral to include Japan. Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi recently elevated India's look-east policy to an
"act-east" policy, making India a robust "actor" in the security
apparatus of the Indo--Pacific. [India has now become an active
participant in various security mechanisms concerning the Indo--Pacific,
which include the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), East Asia Summit (EAS),
and ADMM Plus. **Naval engagement between the two nations has become a
routine procedure at various levels, such as the Malabar
exercises**]{.underline}, Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercises and
anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. **[More importantly, India
and the US share the perception that China's emergence as a great power
in the region would disrupt freedom of navigation in the
Indio-Pacific,]{.underline}** especially in the South China Sea.
Undoubtedly, New Delhi wants to emerge as a strong maritime power in the
Indian Ocean region, and is expanding its influence to the western
Pacific. India is willing to back the US on its pivot strategy, but has
made it clear that it is not open to the idea of becoming an American
ally.69 At the same time, [New Delhi is enhancing its bilateral
strategic partnership with friendly East Asian countries such as Japan,
Vietnam, South Korea, Indonesia, and Singapore]{.underline}, so-called
allies of the US. India is building up an advanced force structure in
the Indian Ocean and expects the US to support this in terms of
high-level defense technology. **[At the same time, both countries can
work together to protect their mutual interests, such as freedom of
navigation, disaster management, domain awareness and, above all,
countering China's dominance in the Indo--Pacific region.]{.underline}**
The convergence of the "pivot" and "act east" happens at two levels:
strategic and operational. [At the strategic level, the US and India
share a broad strategic interest in setting limits to China's
geopolitical horizons]{.underline} and working together to support
mutually reinforcing goals without becoming "allies" in the traditional
sense of the balancing.70 To validate this, the [defense cooperation has
reached at the higher levels and the US has conveyed its readiness to
address New Delhi's quest for increasingly sophisticated
technologies.]{.underline} The 2005 Framework agreement set the platform
for a joint mechanism in a mutually beneficial manner. One of the thrust
areas of the pivot is the US interest in encouraging and assisting
regional states in developing capabilities to deal with shared
challenges.71 The former US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter projected
India as the biggest and most dynamic country in this region and has
expressed the US' commitment to upgrading the current level of defense
cooperation, especially from that of a "buyer and seller" to a more
substantial one, in which the US will share important cutting-edge
technologies, co-production and joint research and development, which
will include jet engines, aircraft carrier design, and construction, and
other areas.72 Importantly, of late the US has begun to recognize
India's leadership position in the Indian Ocean region, which gives them
greater energy and time to target the western Pacific including the
South China Sea. In his first visit to India, US Defense Secretary James
Mattis acknowledged India's standing in the Indo--Pacific, stating [that
"India has a vital role to play in supporting South East Asia's regional
institutions -- particularly ASEAN --]{.underline} and in building
partner capacity across the region. We appreciate India's leadership in
the Indian Ocean and we seek to work together to build a resilient
regional architecture." 73 **[With India's strong leadership in the
Indian Ocean region in tandem with the US preponderance in the western
Pacific, and the support of US allies and other Southeast Asian
countries, Chinese hegemonic ambitions could be thwarted.]{.underline}**
Operationally, the cooperation is growing largely in the maritime
domain. The Maritime Security Cooperation Framework of 2006 enhanced
mutual understanding of the challenges both countries face in this
domain. The areas identified for potential collaboration were the
prevention of transnational crime at sea; safety of ships, crew, and
property as well of navigation; and prevention of illicit trafficking in
weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems, and related
materials. [A major success of this maritime cooperation has been the
manner in which the countries conduct joint naval
exercises]{.underline}; in fact, India conducts more exercises with the
US than with any other country.74 Malabar started as a modest table-top
exercise but now includes advanced platforms, such destroyers and
aircraft carriers, and conducting war games. **[Recently, India and the
US have decided to implement an agreement to improve interoperability
between their defense forces, specially their navies, called Helicopter
Operations from Ships Other Than Aircraft Carriers
(HOSTAC).]{.underline}**75 Cooperation between the two navies continues
at a steady pace as both military establishments continue to build
people-topeople ties, conduct exercises, and attend professional
military courses. However, India is still reluctant to participate in
any joint operations with the US Navy as New Delhi has not endorsed a US
proposal to conduct joint patrols in the South China Sea, though both
countries affirm the importance of freedom of navigation in the
region.76 Since both countries pursue different strategies, philosophies
and operational procedures, perhaps joint operations is the one area in
which they would face the most difficulty. At the same time, both
countries need to overcome the political obstacles that the US faces
from India77 and the technical regulations that constrains the US from
forging a deep defence engagement with India. [Through maritime
cooperation, India expects to receive advanced systems from the US, in
terms of hardware as well as advanced technology, which would help it
keep the Indian Ocean as free]{.underline} and open as it was at the
time of US supremacy in the region at the time of the Cold War.
Conclusion **[The Indo--US relationship has become an important
component of the foreign policies of both the US and
India]{.underline}**: for the US, India has a role as a trusted partner
in its security strategy toward the Indo--Pacific, and for India, US
support is necessary to enable it to emerge as a "credible power" in the
international system. [The US' main concern is China's increasing
assertiveness in the East and South China seas]{.underline}, wherein
none of the regional powers have the wherewithal to withstand China. As
a result, the US has to remain a preponderant power, to maintain the
balance of power in the western Pacific. At the same time, [the
US]{.underline} cannot deploy its forces simultaneously in the western
Pacific and the Indian Ocean theaters. It [requires a trusted partner in
the Indian Ocean region, so it can focus on the western Pacific in order
to keep its security assurance to its allies and to counter
China.]{.underline} **[An offshore balancing strategy in the Indian
Ocean will help the US give greater attention to the western Pacific
while its interests in the Indian Ocean will not be adversely affected
because of the presence of the offshore balancer.]{.underline}**
Undoubtedly, a militarily strong India can counter China in the Indian
Ocean region and ensure freedom of navigation in the water body.
**[Based on current progress in Indo--US relations, India could become
the true offshore balancer for the US in Asia.]{.underline}** However,
to sustain the offshore balancing mechanism and to enable it to
contribute to the future stability of the Indo--Pacific, the
relationship must be based on mutually acceptable terms and an equal
partnership. Ever since its independence, self-reliance has been the
bedrock of India's foreign and security policy. It has passed through
various periods with varying nomenclature, starting with Nehruvian
idealism and the nonaligned movement (NAM), a Soviet tilt during the
1970s and 1980s without being a follower of the Soviet system, and
strategic autonomy under the United Progressive Alliance government
which made it a 'credible' power in the international system. It has now
turned to the "make in India" program to reduce its dependence on
foreign-made defense systems, while making the nation self-sufficient,
as well as enabling it to export advanced military hardware. India
expects have continued technological support for its nascent but
thriving arms industry from the US. It does not want to be part of a
client-patron relationship with any foreign country, and wants to emerge
a truly independent and credible power in the international system. In
the changing security dynamics of Asia, India believes that close
cooperation with the US would fulfill its ambitions of being a major
power in the international system without diluting its independence and
autonomy. At the same time, convergence in the security policies of the
two countries in the Indian Ocean could be extended to other parts of
the Indo--Pacific. [The Indo--US offshore balancing mechanism could
establish a strong foundation for the evolving Quadrilateral Mechanism
(QUAD), comprising the US, India, Japan, and Australia]{.underline},
which is also based on strong bilateral relationships between all four
countries. The success of the QUAD also depends on how far India and
Japan can resist China with the support of the US in their respective
regions -- India in the Indian Ocean and Japan in the East China Sea. In
this regard, **[the offshore balancing mechanism in the Indo--US
relationship will contribute to enduring peace and stability in the
Indo--Pacific.]{.underline}**

### Offshore Balancing Good -- Asia -- Generic

#### Offshore balancing is key to Asian stability. China's A2AD strategy and development of the D21DF missile prevents US naval deployments in the region. The US needs to reinvigorate regional allies like India, Japan, and Australia to check against revisionist China.

US offshore balancing in Asia The balance of power in the Asia-Pacific
was maintained largely by US military preponderance,9 but **[the US now
faces difficulty in projecting its power hegemonistically in
Asia]{.underline}**. During the Cold War, northeast Asia was the major
theater of the US balancing mechanism in Asia, which was also very much
part of the power rivalry between the US and the former Soviet Union[.
Regional countries like Japan and South Korea allowed stationing US
troops both for preserving their own sovereignty and to protect US
interests in the region]{.underline}. However, **[none of them worked as
offshore balancers because of inherent constrains -- Japan's pacifist
constitution and South Korea's lack of military
capability.]{.underline}** In fact, the US created an alliance system in
Asia with the aim of exerting maximum control over smaller allies'
actions.10 [In the case of Japan, the US intended to prevent Tokyo from
reinvigorating its power in the future.]{.underline} Importantly, during
the Cold War period there was no regional hegemon to challenge US power
in Asia, and it enjoyed an asymmetric military power equation with both
its allies and potential enemies. But today, [China fits well into the
category of a regional hegemon to counter the US position in Asia.
**China enjoys conventional military superiority in the mainland of
northeast Asia,**]{.underline} while the US is still a distant power
even though it is the predominant maritime power in the western Pacific.
In a confrontation between a land power and a maritime power, each
side's military strengths are at a disadvantage in the others'
theater.11 [To counter US military advancement to its shores, China has
developed an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) strategy that would allow
Beijing to obstruct the arrival of additional US military units and
limit the effectiveness of forward deployed forces in the western
Pacific]{.underline}.12 The **[development of the D21DF missile which is
targeted to strike aircraft carrier groups outside the first island
chain has led to a rethinking in the overall US strategy toward the
Pacific]{.underline}**. Although China's military budget is only about a
third of America's, if present trends continue the gap will quickly
narrow.13 A few years ago, The Economist projected that China's defense
spending could overtake US spending after 2035.14 Undoubtedly, [China's
emergence would badly affect US supremacy in the Indo--Pacific
region.]{.underline}15 In this regard, [US policy]{.underline} toward
the Indo--Pacific [is now centered on three]{.underline} different, but
complimenting [strategies: deep engagement with China, active defense,
and offshore balancing.]{.underline} Although the US continues deep
engagement with China at various levels, the great power rivalry, as
offensive realists predict, cannot be avoided.16 The US and China are
destined to be rivals for supremacy in Asia. [The US employs an "active
defense" strategy to defeat the Chinese threat at its
origin]{.underline}, for which [it pursues a preponderance and forward
deployment of naval assets in the western Pacific]{.underline} where
China's threat is at its maximum.17 The US wants to ensure its own
preeminent position in the western Pacific and the sovereignty of its
trusted allies. At the same time, [it cannot simultaneously focus on the
Pacific and the Indian oceans, otherwise it would cripple its military
preponderance in the western Pacific.]{.underline} In this regard,
[**the US engages in an offshore balancing strategy toward the Indian
Ocean region.** Offensive realism suggests that China should be
countered effectively at the local level otherwise]{.underline} the US
would have to step in and balance against the rising power.18
Mearsheimer argues that [distant hegemons usually prefer to let the
local great powers check an aspiring hegemon with outside
support]{.underline}.19 **[The regional states can balance against a
potential hegemon and the incumbent hegemon can confidently shape
alliance relationships with the local powers which favor an offshore
balancing strategy]{.underline}**.20 [The best way for the US to deter
dangerous rivals]{.underline} in other regions from pursuing regional
hegemony [is to rely on local powers to counter aspiring
hegemons]{.underline}, otherwise it would have to keep its military
forces ready over the horizon. Indeed, **[an offshore balancing strategy
against China becomes necessary for the US]{.underline}** for two
reasons; first, the deepening financial crisis will compel retrenchment
in the US, which will be increasingly less able to invest in its
military; and, second, as ascending powers such as China become
wealthier, their military expenditures will expand.21 Christopher Layne
argues that an [offshore balancing strategy would be]{.underline} one of
the best options for the US, as it is [considerably less expensive than
a strategy of preponderance against China]{.underline}.22 An [offshore
balancing]{.underline} strategy **[would also allow it to preserve its
dominance in the Western Hemisphere, while countering potential hegemons
in Europe, Indo-- Pacific, and the Persian Gulf, and would encourage
secondary states to take the lead in checking rising
powers,]{.underline}** leaving the US to intervene only when
necessary.23 However, if the local power is threatened or China really
changes the status quo by utilizing military means to settle territorial
disputes that China has involved in with the neighboring countries then
the US can intervene militarily in the region. Under offshore balancing,
[the US can propel a local power, which could become the first line of
defense, letting them uphold the balance of power in their own
neighborhood]{.underline}, as they have a far greater interest in
preventing a state from dominating them. Washington could provide
assistance for their military modernisation to thwart the threat from
the rising hegemon**[. This could be through the supply of sophisticated
defense systems, technological cooperation, and joint
exercises]{.underline}**. [Defense technology cooperation would be
advantageous in helping the local power establish a domestic defense
infrastructure system and enabling them to grow faster.]{.underline} In
the process, **[both countries would develop greater synergy in their
security policies]{.underline}**, which would expand beyond the regional
level. The [defense cooperation would be mutually beneficial and
enduring]{.underline} as it would address a common threat. In offshore
balancing, the local power enjoys greater autonomy compared with a
traditional alliance system, as the local power has a minimal amount of
commitment to the great power's other global interests. **[The local
power is more interested in deterring the rising hegemon in its
backyard.]{.underline}** With the help of the great power, [it can
emerge strong enough to take on the rising hegemon independently and can
also manage regional security in its backyar]{.underline}d. Thus, once
the offshore balancing starts functioning effectively, the great power
can gradually withdraw from the region. [The US has always showed keen
interest in preserving the status quo in Asia]{.underline}. As far back
as a 100 years ago, renowned American geostrategist Alfred Thayer Mahan
put forth the argument that the security of an emergent US was
intimately tied to the Asian balance of power as well as to that of
Europe.24 Eminent Australian strategist Paul Dibb predicted in 1995 that
[India had "greater potential as a power of influence" and "could emerge
as a useful player in a multipolar Asian balance]{.underline}" and
"attract American interest as a counterbalance to China." 25 [India
traditionally follows democratic principles and human rights values,
does not pursue great power ambition]{.underline}, and fits the
requirements of an offshore balancer in Asia to counter China.
[**India's military modernisation is not aimed at establishing hegemony
in South Asia but at countering the threat from China and its proxy
Pakistan.** Today, India has acquired military capabilities to target
all the major cities in China]{.underline}. **[New Delhi has also
acquired second-strike nuclear capability from three levels: air, land,
and sea]{.underline}**.26 However, with a deep-rooted sense of pride and
nationalism in its strategic thinking, New Delhi wants to become a
respected, credible, and independent power in the international system,
not a junior partner to the US in Asia

### Offshore Balancing Good -- Middle East

[The Trump administration's recent decisions to withdraw US troops from
Syria]{.underline}, have once again sparked a debate on the United
States' role in the world. In a series of recent tweets, President
Donald Trump hailed his decision to withdraw US troops [and questioned
the rationale for the US fighting counter-terrorism operations abroad.
Trump deemed the United States to have received "NOTHING but spending
precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others]{.underline}
who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing?"
Predictably, most American lawmakers, media, and academia gasped over
Trump's decision undercutting American commitments towards allied
Kurdish forces, ceding ground to growing Iranian influence. They warned
of this decision emboldening Russian stranglehold over the region, and
even that it may pave way for the resurgence of the Islamic State. Yet,
a small, but prominent, group of commentators and legislators hailed
Trump's decision. For instance, [noted realist scholar Stephen Walt
claimed that Trump had done "the right thing", and Republican Senator
Rand Paul -- known for his libertarian views -- announced that he was
"very proud of the President" for withdrawing from Syria.]{.underline}
Increasingly, **[calls for a more narrow conception of US interests
abroad have been growing]{.underline}**. Advocates for [US retrenchment
to a grand strategy of restraint]{.underline} often [deem **the United
States to lack "the need, the capability, and the mandate to manage
global security**]{.underline}." Moreover, [some]{.underline} even
[argue sustaining American primacy for the longer term]{.underline}
**[by husbanding resources with an offshore-balancing
strategy.]{.underline}** Stopping short of outright isolationism, such
an approach dictates, "[instead of policing the world, the United States
would encourage other countries to take the lead in checking rising
powers, intervening itself only when necessary."]{.underline} Most
importantly, this approach construes [US global leadership as "not an
end in itself]{.underline}", rather it deems the same to be "[desirable
only insofar as it benefits the United States directly." In Trump's
conduct of the United States' foreign policy, such a view holds
currency]{.underline} -- from accusing European and North American
allies of treating the US "like a piggy bank to be robbed", to
announcing other countries like Turkey to take the lead in fighting the
Islamic State. In addition, in expressing deep aversion on
nation-building activities abroad, senior Trump administration officials
have announced that [the United States will no longer pursue its
"longstanding pattern of aid without effect, assistance without
accountability, and relief without reform]{.underline}." One may look no
further than Pakistan with regards to evidence supporting that shift in
policy, as **[the Trump administration holds back aid amounting to over
\$1 billion, and supports Pakistan's grey-listing at multilateral
platforms like the Financial Action Task Force]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, on husbanding resources, the [Trump]{.underline}
administration's [repeated outcry over seeking "fair" and "reciprocal
deals" has even pulled into Trump's cross-fire countries like
India]{.underline} -- notwithstanding the fact that India takes the
tenth spot on the list of countries that register a deficit with the US
and supposedly enjoys broad bipartisan support amongst US policymakers
and national-security officials. Further, although [the
transactionalism]{.underline} witnessed in recent American foreign
policy [can, in large parts, be attributed to Trump, a slow shift away
from the standard pre-set for liberal internationalism]{.underline} has
been evident in the post-Cold War world. With continued American primacy
-- chiefly in the military realm, at its core, the immediate aftermath
of the Cold War under President George H. W. [Bush hailed the emergence
of "a new world order, where brutality will go unrewarded and aggression
will meet collective resistance]{.underline}." Thereafter, the Bill
[Clinton]{.underline} years [saw]{.underline} the [employment of US
force for a myriad range of non-combat missions]{.underline} -- across
the Balkans and Sub-Saharan Africa, [under the liberal internationalist
grand strategy of "enlargement" of democratic regimes]{.underline}
mainly in the areas of the former Soviet Union. This inclination towards
employing the US military as the 'tip of the spear' towards US foreign
policy interests, reached its peak under the subsequent George W. Bush
years. Armed by a neoconservative outlook and American military primacy
riding high in the post-9/11 fog of war, the [Bush administrations
pursued regime-change agendas primarily in the Middle East]{.underline}.
Subsequently, an American standing -- tarnished by the Bush-era's
militarised unilateralism -- fed the [Obama]{.underline}
administrations' motivation behind 'leading from behind', [encouraging
burden-sharing, cobbling multilateral coalitions across varied realms of
nuclear non-proliferation]{.underline}, combating terrorist safe-havens,
and even humanitarian interventions. Finally, [the trend away from
liberal internationalism]{.underline} seems to have **[reached its
farthest point on non-intervention and minimal US stewardship with the
Trump presidency.]{.underline}** By April 2016, support for American
activism abroad had dwindled. According to a poll, about 57 percent of
Americans agreed that the United States should "deal with its own
problems and let others deal with theirs the best they can." In the
near-future, charged by nationalist overtones of a renewed conservative
movement, the '**[America First' outlook may just usher in the last mile
towards offshore-balancing.]{.underline}** Many see the shuttering of
The Weekly Standard -- run by noted neoconservative commentator Bill
Kirstol, as an ominous sign of the shift away from the Reagan era
conservatism of touting the United States' perceived stature as the
"shining city upon a hill". Moreover, commentators have even noted
[Trump's conservative nationalism of 'America First\' to have forced the
marginalised liberal internationalists and Bush-era neoconservatives to
find common ground despite their divergences]{.underline} over
employment of force and multilateralism. Further, [increasingly younger
American generations seem to have a greater preference for a less global
America]{.underline}, as revealed by a recent Pew Research polls. One
poll found [younger Americans (under 30)]{.underline} [to
be]{.underline} generally [less likely to prioritise limiting
power]{.underline} and influence [of foreign powers like Russia, and
China]{.underline} -- only three-in-ten young people concurred, while 54
percent (65 or older) argued for the US to actively engage in limiting
the influence of Russia. Another poll found a substantial age divide in
the priority given to maintaining US military primacy -- 64 percent
older Americans concurring vs. 30 percent younger Americans. Reduction
of American military commitments abroad drew support of 34 percent
younger Americans vs. 20 percent older Americans. On combatting
terrorism as well, younger generations seemed to support less US
military activism. When asked if the US should actively take measures
towards seeking and destroying terror groups in other countries, only 27
percent of Americans under 50 deemed it as a top priority compared to 44
percent of those 50 and older. Thus, future generations' preferences
against US activism abroad compounded by [the rise of Trumpian
conservative nationalism, seems poised to challenge the post-Cold War
dominance of liberal internationalism in American strategic
culture.]{.underline}

### Offshore Balancing Good -- Europe

#### Trump and a growing body of domestic support are beginning offshore balancing in Europe. Offshore balancing maintains European peace despite Russia. Russia's defensive posture and declining GDP make a US led NATO obsolete

[Washington is filled with sacred cows. And none is more sacrosanct than
NATO.]{.underline} On the organization's 70th anniversary this week,
encomiums fill the air for "the strongest, most successful alliance in
history," as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg put it. [At least
one person in Washington disagrees: U.S. President Donald
Trump]{.underline}. And although the State Department has affirmed that
"the U.S. commitment ... to NATO remains firm," **[the organization's
future is far from certain]{.underline}**, and this year's birthday
celebration is rather subdued. [When NATO was formed seven decades ago,
the world was very different]{.underline}: The Soviet Union had advanced
into Central Europe, and Western European nations were still recovering
from World War II. NATO would help them, Secretary of State Dean Acheson
warned, but it would not do so forever[. When asked if the United States
would need "to send substantial numbers of troops over there as a more
or less permanent contribution," he assured Congress that it
wouldn't]{.underline}. Even Dwight Eisenhower, NATO's first commander
and a future U.S. president, presciently warned that such an American
garrison could "discourage the development of the necessary military
strength Western European countries should provide themselves." [**The
Europeans eventually did recover but, as predicted, lagged in** defense.
The United States has for decades demanded that European countries spend
more on defense---and they agree, only to inevitably fall
short]{.underline}. The process endlessly repeats, teaching each
generation of European leaders that no matter how little they do,
Washington will defend the continent. The dissolution of the Warsaw Pact
and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 put NATO's survival in
doubt. **[To give the organization a new raison d'être, officials
suggested a plethora of improbable new duties.]{.underline}** For
instance, Robert Zoellick, then-counselor to Secretary of State James
Baker, argued that it was necessary to ["transform established
institutions, such as NATO, to serve new missions that will fit the new
era."]{.underline} David Abshire, who had been the U.S. ambassador to
NATO under President Ronald Reagan, suggested that the alliance ["could
coordinate the transfer of environmental-control technology to the
East."]{.underline} Curious work for a military alliance. [NATO decided
to stay relevant in two ways.]{.underline} First[, it opted to expand
its membership to countries formerly in the Soviet orbit]{.underline}.
Second, [it opted to undertake activities in nonmember
nations]{.underline}. The former violated assurances that NATO had given
Moscow in 1990 and 1991, fomenting Russian hostility. The latter
transformed NATO into an offensive force, most notably during its
mission in Serbia in 1999. Nevertheless, as U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar
argued at the time, the choice was simple. The alliance would "go out of
area or out of business." This process continues. **[Alliance solidarity
led Europe into a protracted war in Afghanistan and the United States
into a conflagration in Libya, even though neither conflict served the
other allies' interests]{.underline}**. [Expansion grows ever more
far-fetched, with the alliance most recently adding Montenegro and North
Macedonia, small states that face no obvious threat]{.underline} and can
make no serious contribution to Europe's defense. Against significant
European opposition, moreover, the United States even supports bringing
Georgia and Ukraine into the body. As a result, some analysts today call
NATO a "global alliance," with pretensions to patrol much if not most of
the world. All the while, Washington remains responsible for the vast
majority of its combat capabilities in Europe and beyond. [The disparity
among allies' contributions causes constant friction.]{.underline} U.S.
President Barack Obama lamented Europe's "free riders." In 2011, Defense
Secretary Robert Gates warned that there would be "[dwindling appetite
and patience in the U.S. Congress---and in the American body politic
writ large---to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations
that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources
or]{.underline} ... to be serious and capable partners in their own
defense." Future leaders, he suggested, "[may not consider the return on
America's investment in NATO worth the cost.]{.underline}" Enter Trump.
Unfortunately, **[the burden-sharing debate has been as unproductive as
it has been lengthy.]{.underline}** Europeans expect the United States
to ride to the rescue in any crisis, so they see little reason to spend
much on their own militaries, especially during economically difficult
times at home. [Yet the same U.S. officials who complain about lagging
European defense efforts routinely reassure those allies of America's
enduring commitment.]{.underline} Washington even created the European
Reassurance Initiative, recently renamed the European Deterrence
Initiative, to increase U.S. manpower in Eastern Europe. **[Yet Europe
does not really need U.S. military support]{.underline}**. Although
scholars like the Heritage Foundation's Luke Coffey and Daniel Kochis
have argued that [Russian resurgence makes NATO as
important]{.underline} to European stability as ever, that [is
false]{.underline}. [The continent matches the U.S. economy and
possesses a larger population.]{.underline} [Meanwhile, European states
have roughly 10 times the economic strength and four times the
population of Russia. They collectively spend four times as much as
Moscow on armed forces]{.underline}. Obviously, collective action can be
difficult, and European governments need to be smarter about their
spending. However, [a sense of urgency would overcome many of these
problems.]{.underline} But that doesn't exist. Few Europeans perceive a
serious enough threat to spend more on the military. U.S. Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo acknowledged as much when he recently told a
conservative group that when he asks the Europeans what they are
prepared to do about defense, they say, "It's tough. Our voters just
really don't like to spend money on defense." Although European
countries did start to spend more after Russia intervened in Ukraine,
the uptick has barely exceeded economic growth. As a percentage of GDP,
Europe's military outlays remain below those of seven years ago. In
2014, the number, which includes Canada, fell to 1.4 percent; last year,
it was 1.47 percent. The future is not likely to be much better. To be
fair, parts of Europe, especially on NATO's edge, do appear to be more
worried about the possibility of Russian aggression. **[But even if
Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite his country's economic woes,
wanted to go after the Baltic states or Poland, he would risk further
economic isolation and almost certain military
retaliation]{.underline}**. [The Baltics' ethnic Russian minorities do
not look to Moscow as a protector and have shown little interest in
securing its rule. Poland's history promises an ever hostile population
if conquered.]{.underline} Perhaps that is why, according to Michael
Kofman, a researcher at CNA, [Russian military forces are not deployed
for combat in the Baltic region]{.underline}. "[Despite provocative air
and naval activity concentrated in the area,"]{.underline} he wrote in
2017, "[Russian forces based there are principally defensive, and aging
to boot."]{.underline} That could change, of course, but any attack
would require massive redeployments. [There would be no
cakewalk.]{.underline} [As for Russia's conflicts with Georgia and
Ukraine, they do look threatening but also appear to have an essentially
defensive purpose]{.underline}---prevent the two nations' inclusion in
NATO and protect the historic naval base of Sevastopol. Recent
diplomatic disclosures revealed that Moscow had good reason to feel
betrayed by talk of expanding the alliance. [Russia's actions cannot be
justified, of course, but if Moscow had expanded the Warsaw Pact to
Latin America, engineered a coup in Mexico City, and offered to bring
that nation into an anti-American alliance, Washington would have been
equally displeased]{.underline}. Consider Washington's sharp reaction to
Russian troops arriving in more distant Venezuela. **[Given Europe's
size, economic strength, and lack of clear and present danger, it is
time to end the fantasy of burden sharing]{.underline}**. Last year, the
United States devoted \$1,898 per person to the military. NATO's
European members spent \$503[**. If they take over the core duty of
defending Europe, they could spend what they want without hectoring from
Washington. They could conciliate or threaten Russia. They could add or
eliminate sanctions. They could make whatever decisions they wish, but
they would be responsible for the consequences.** The United States
could become an associate member of NATO, or whatever the Europeans wish
to call their new defense compact, and forge new agreements]{.underline}
with Europe to cooperate where interests coincide. Rather than remain
permanently entangled in disputes of little matter to Washington, **[it
could informally play the role of offshore balancer, prepared to respond
more directly to any unlikely hegemonic threat.]{.underline}** NATO has
reached the venerable age of 70. [It should be pensioned off and
replaced with security architecture developed to meet current
challenges]{.underline}. Instead, Pompeo quipped, member states were
meeting this week "to make sure that NATO is around for the next 70
years." [Where will Trump take NATO? He is unpredictable and inconstant.
Still, he spent years inveighing against NATO]{.underline}, and he
finally has the power to do something about it. He should insist that
Europe take over responsibility for its own security.

### Offshore Balancing -- AT: Liberal Hegemony Scholars

#### Reject their evidence -- it's based in an outdated and self-inoculated establishment of liberal hegemony. Academia, think tanks, and the media are saturated with unaccountable scholars who've succumbed to group think and have been repeatedly proven wrong.

**Walt 19** Stephen Walt is the Robert and Renée Belfer Professor of

OUT WITH THE OLD Despite the disappointments of the past 25 years, [the
American foreign policy elite remains convinced that global leadership
is their birthright and that Washington must continue trying to force
other countries to conform to U.S. dictates]{.underline}. This
perspective is an article of faith at **[almost every foreign policy
think tank inside the Beltway and is repeatedly invoked in task-force
reports, policy briefs, and op-eds.]{.underline}** [A similar groupthink
pervades the U.S. media, where unrepentant neoconservatives and
unchastened liberal internationalists monopolize the ranks of full-time
pundits; proponents of realism, restraint, and nonintervention appear
sporadically at best. **The result is that foreign policy debates are
heavily skewed in favor of endless intervention.**]{.underline} Moving
back to a more realist grand strategy will require broadening the
parameters of debate and challenging the entrenched interests that have
promoted and defended a failed foreign policy. [The clubbiness of the
foreign policy establishment has also produced a disturbing lack of
accountability]{.underline}. Although [the community]{.underline}
contains many dedicated, imaginative, and honorable individuals, it
**[is dominated by a highly networked caste of insiders who are
reluctant to judge one another lest they be judged
themselves]{.underline}**. As a result, **[error-prone officials
routinely fail upward and receive new opportunities to repeat past
mistakes.]{.underline}** [Consider the officials responsible
fo]{.underline}r (and the commentators who cheered on) [the bungled
Middle East peace process, the misguided expansion of nato, the botched
wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the cia\'s torture of detainees in the war
on terrorism, the National Security Agency\'s warrantless surveillance
of Americans, the disastrous nato intervention in Libya, and the
American machinations in Ukraine that gave Russia a pretext to seize
Crimea]{.underline}. **[None of those officials or commentators has
suffered significant professional penalties for his or her mistakes or
malfeasance. Indeed, nearly all of them still enjoy prominent positions
in government, think tanks, the media, or academia.]{.underline}** No
one is infallible, of course, and a desire to hold people accountable
could be taken too far. Policymakers often learn from past mistakes and
become more effective over time. [But when the same people keep making
the same errors and neither recognize nor regret them, it is time to
look for new people with better ideas. Despite the stagnation within the
foreign policy establishment, the prospects for a more realist, more
restrained U.S. foreign policy are better today than they have been in
many years]{.underline}. For all his flaws, Trump has made it easier to
propose alternatives to liberal hegemony by expressing such disdain for
the elite consensus. [Younger Americans are more skeptical of their
country\'s imperial pretensions than are their elders]{.underline}, and
some new members of Congress seem bent on clawing back some of the
control over foreign policy that presidents have amassed over the past
70 years.

### AT: Parent & McDonald -- Decline Peaceful

#### **Parent & McDonald are wrong -- their study ignores regime type & generalizes poor examples**

Studies. She teaches in War Studies at King's College, "Managing

sg

But this is where [I fear the aggregate data]{.underline}---prioritizing
a large number of cases all treated with equal weight---[may lead us
astray]{.underline}. Because [two things not apparent in the numbers may
prove much more important than the findings from Parent and McDonald's
study]{.underline}. **[First, it]{.underline}** probably **[matters
whether a state is declining from the top spot]{.underline}** or a spot
near the top. **[Losing the hegemon's spot matters]{.underline}** **[an
awful lot]{.underline} [more than losing an ordinal
ranking]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} There are many strong and
important countries in the world, but the [relative ranking]{.underline}
among them is of little importance. [Does Germany care whether it is the
third- or fifth-largest economy?]{.underline} Perhaps marginally, but
not fundamentally. [But countries do care whether they hold the top
spot,]{.underline} the hegemon, because that gives them the ability to
set the rules of the game. [If China becomes the hegemon, it will change
the rules]{.underline} from what they have been in the time of American
hegemony: Preference will replace law, small states will be dictated
terms by strong states---[patterns we have already begun to see in
China's intimidation of regional neighbors and predatory trade and
business practices]{.underline}. The United States and its liberal
allies may well fight to prevent those changes. **[Second, the nature of
the state matters more than Parent and McDonald credit]{.underline}**.
[They find no correlation between regime type]{.underline} (that is, the
nature of the state: communist, authoritarian, or democratic) [and war
involving a declining power]{.underline}. [But in their 16 cases of
relative decline]{.underline} since 1870, [the United Kingdom is the
declining power six times]{.underline} (Parent and McDonald elegantly
term it "the most experienced declining power"); [Germany is the rising
power eight times]{.underline}. It may be true, as Parent and McDonald
conclude, that "aggressive responses to decline appear to be the
exception, rather than the rule," but in their data, Germany is the only
state to become more aggressive and authoritarian. And for Britain to
provide so many peaceful instances of relative decline may just tell us
that Britain is exceptionally agile in playing a weakening hand well and
peacefully. **[What we]{.underline}** may be **[see]{.underline}**ing
**[in their study is less a generalizable theory of the behavior of
declining powers than a demonstration of British and German strategic
cultures]{.underline}**. They may both be anomalous, which [**makes them
poor examples on which to build a theory.** Regime type may also matter
much more because it speaks to a state's resilience.]{.underline} Parent
and McDonald find that "recovery is less likely than not, but the only
road to recovery leads through retrenchment," and that means a
government must acknowledge its circumstances and choose different
policies. [Authoritarian states tend to be more brittle than their
democratic counterparts.]{.underline} [Lacking free media]{.underline}
to publicize failures and challenge polices, [lacking distributed power
and civil society]{.underline} to experiment with alternatives and check
excess[, and lacking elections]{.underline} as competitions among
different possible directions for policy, [authoritarian governments
tend to remain committed to failing policies longer.]{.underline}
Twilight of the Titans is a meaningful contribution to the debate about
whether the decline of a great power is to be feared as a cause of war
in the international system. Parent and McDonald took a big, important
question and tried to find an answer by aggregating what we know about
both great powers and their mid-level counterparts. It is not simply an
interesting academic question; they make a very strong case that
fighting preventive wars is self-defeating for declining powers. Rather
than fight to prevent a rising challenger, states losing their relative
power should retrench and compromise to avoid conflict. Adopting Parent
and McDonald's policy recommendations, though, would be learning to live
with "democracy with Chinese characteristics." Which, interestingly
enough, is also the policy recommendation Graham Allison makes in
Destined for War.

#### Completely ending the Iranian nuclear deal spurs domino proliferation in the Middle East

**Robbins 19** James Robbins is a BBC diplomatic correspondent. \["Iran
nuclear deal: \'Small window\' to save deal, says Jeremy Hunt," *BBC*,
7-15-2019, URL: <https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-48984679>\] DTS

[Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a \"small window\" to save
the Iran nuclear deal]{.underline}, as he launched a fresh bid to ease
tensions in the Gulf. Mr Hunt has been meeting EU foreign ministers to
raise concerns about Iran breaching some of its commitments. The deal,
which involves Iran limiting nuclear activities in return for the easing
of economic sanctions, is under pressure after the US withdrew in 2018.
T[he summit comes amid heightened tensions between the UK and
Iran.]{.underline} The UK seized an Iranian oil tanker earlier this
month and, in response, Iran threatened to detain a British oil tanker.
However, Mr Hunt said on Saturday the tanker, [Grace 1, could be
released if the UK is guaranteed the oil it was carrying is not bound
for Syria.]{.underline} Speaking on his way into the meeting in
Brussels, [Mr Hunt said the Iran nuclear deal was not dead \"yet\", but
he warned that **if Iran acquired nuclear weapons it would become \"a
very, very toxic and dangerous situation\".**]{.underline} He added:
\"Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon. [We
think there is still a closing, but small, window to keep the deal
alive.\"]{.underline} Mr Hunt said he would work with the European
partners of the deal - France and Germany - to find a way to
\"preserve\" the agreement. In a joint statement issued ahead of the
meeting, Britain, France and Germany reiterated their support for the
deal. [But they said they were \"deeply troubled\" by recent events in
the Gulf and \"concerned\" over US-Iran relations.]{.underline} The
statement added that all stakeholders should \"pause and consider the
possible consequences of their actions\". Earlier this month Iran said
it would be breaching the deal by breaking a limit set on uranium
enrichment. [Why does saving the Iran nuclear deal matter? Even if Iran
does not actually build a nuclear warhead]{.underline}, [**it only has
to reach the point at which it COULD produce one for its nervous
neighbours to decide this is too much of a risk. They will want their
own one too - as a deterrent.** Statements from Saudi Arabia, Iran\'s
Middle East rival, have made it clear the country would not accept a
nuclear-armed Iran.]{.underline} So then, as stated by diplomats in
Brussels, [we are into a nuclear arms race.]{.underline} What does that
mean in practice? [**In all probability Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt
would all want to become nuclear weapons powers, with the potential to
obliterate entire cities.** This would be in a part of the world that
has seen almost continuous conflict in places for the last 71
years.]{.underline} Finally, [**there is the risk that should Iran ever
go nuclear some fear it could pass on a warhead to a non-state militia
like Hezbollah.** This is why the Iran nuclear deal matters, even if you
don\'t live anywhere near the Gulf.]{.underline} What is the Iran
nuclear deal? In 2015, Iran signed up to a long-term deal - called the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - after the international community
expressed concerns they were trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran,
which insisted its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, agreed to
limit some nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors. In
return, the other signatories - UK, France, Germany, China and Russia -
agreed to lift some of the crippling economic sanctions placed on Iran.
Speaking ahead of Monday\'s meeting, Mr Hunt said: \"**[The Middle East
is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, but if the
different parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an
existential threat to mankind.\"]{.underline}**

weight and presence on the world stage, [Europe's principal players have

hegemony]{.underline}. The brute reality, as things stand, is that
[**Europe does not yet have the tools---or the will---to project its

reserve currency until it is radically reformed,]{.underline} and
without a credible reserve currency, [Europe's financial might cannot
match that of the United States]{.underline}. Even more
fundamentally**[, there remain deep divisions within Europe over whether
it should even seek to be a power, with or without
Britain.]{.underline}** For 15 months, following Trump's May 2018
decision to pull the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal and subsequent
decision to reimpose sanctions on the regime in Tehran, [tensions have
steadily grown between the U.S and Iran.]{.underline} Throughout this
time[, Europe has urged the U.S. back to the table]{.underline} in a bid
[to keep the 2015 agreement]{.underline} negotiated [by the U.S., U.K.,
France, China, Russia, and Germany alive]{.underline}, but with little
obvious success. Whether they like it or not, [the E3 will have to
respond to the Trump administration's imposition Monday of further
sanctions on the Islamic Republic]{.underline}, including restrictions
on its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and individuals close to
him. Following the announcement, Steven Mnuchin, the U.S. Treasury
secretary, said he also planned to designate Iranian Foreign Minister
Javad Zarif, the country's main interlocutor with the West, later this
week. **[This not only ensures that the U.S. cuts off any avenue it has
for negotiations with Tehran to ease tensions, but puts Europe's efforts
at keeping the nuclear deal alive in an ever more perilous
position.]{.underline}**(Iran, in its response Tuesday, called the
sanctions "useless.") Europe's warnings, public and private, about the
dangers of escalation have been ignored; its decision to remain outside
the new U.S. sanctions regime introduced by Trump in November has proved
largely irrelevant. **[In the face of the continuing dominance of the
U.S. financial system, underpinned by the global currency reserve,
European power has melted away.]{.underline}** [The dollar remains
king---and so does the U.S., regardless of the current presidential
incumbent's strained international standing]{.underline}. "**[The U.S.
position on Iran has shown that the EU's security policy is controlled
by the importance of the U.S. dollar to global trade,"]{.underline}**
Tom Tugendhat, the British member of Parliament and chair of the U.K.
Parliament's foreign-affairs committee, told me. "[U.S. sanctions
determine our policy, and unless there is a new global currency and
banking system, it will remain so."]{.underline} **[This reality,
acknowledged in private by European diplomats, officials, and
foreign-policy advisers]{.underline}**, [has all but eliminated European
leverage in the crisis so far.]{.underline} But it is
also---now---serving to shine fresh light on the internal divisions
within the EU over its foreign policy and aspirations as it looks to its
future following Britain's 2016 vote to leave the bloc. The mounting
crisis over Iran has revealed the fundamental tension at the heart of
the EU and its vision for its future role in the world: Does it want to
be a global power or not?

[The Trump administration is weighing sanctions against the Iranian
financial body set up as a go-between for humanitarian trade with
Europe]{.underline}, a move likely to sever the economic and
humanitarian lifeline that France, Germany and the U.K. have sought to
create for Tehran. [The U.S. measures would target the Special Trade and
Finance Institute, which Iran established as a counterpart
to]{.underline} the European mechanism known as [Instex]{.underline},
according to a senior administration official who asked not to be
identified discussing internal deliberations. The official said the
[STFI is essentially an extension of Iran's central bank, which already
is covered by U.S. sanctions and]{.underline}, according to the
administration, hasn't implemented minimum global safeguards against
money laundering and terrorism financing. [European countries
established Instex in January to help shield limited trade with Iran
from U.S. sanctions]{.underline} imposed after President Donald Trump
withdrew from the multinational Iran nuclear deal a year ago. [The new
sanctions,]{.underline} if they take effect, [would probably derail
faltering European efforts to sustain some trade with Iran by avoiding
the use of U.S. dollars or the American financial system. Such a
move]{.underline} \-- still in the early planning stages \-- [would
exacerbate divisions with European nations that have chafed against the
Trump administration's "maximum pressure" campaign against
Iran]{.underline}. It would be the latest effort meant to force the
Islamic Republic back to the negotiating table to discuss a deal
stronger than the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the 2015 agreement
that limited Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.
"[If they are looking at sanctioning STFI, you're essentially trying to
kill Instex through the back door]{.underline}," said Ellie Geranmayeh,
a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations,
referring to the Iranian body. "[If the U.S. were to take action that
kills Instex on arrival, my sense is there will be even more political
backing in Europe to oppose the U.S."]{.underline} The sanctions
deliberations come as German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas visits Tehran.
Iranian Foreign Minister [Javad Zarif said]{.underline} Monday the two
were having "frank talks" about how Iran could still get the economic
benefits it expected by agreeing to the nuclear accord. Javad Zarif
Frank talks with \@HeikoMaas. [**Welcome German recognition that
practical measures to ensure Iran's economic dividends are essential to
preserve #JCPOA. We concurred that dialog among regional countries is
crucial.** Yet in a tacit acknowledgment of the effectiveness of U.S.
sanctions]{.underline}, [European nations have significantly scaled back
their ambition for the mechanism]{.underline}, saying trade through it
would be limited only to transactions covering humanitarian goods. U.S.
sanctions against Iran already include carve-outs for humanitarian
transactions. [But European nations argue that Instex is needed to
provide European companies and banks stronger assurances that they won't
be hit by U.S. sanctions]{.underline} even if they limit themselves to
humanitarian purposes. While the Instex mechanism is relatively obscure
and would probably be used in limited cases, [its opponents say that
letting it survive could create a powerful economic tool later that
could deal a blow to the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions more
broadly.]{.underline} One possibility, they say, is that Trump could
lose re-election in 2020 and a Democratic president could look the other
way as European nations used Instex for a wider range of trade with
Iran, even as sanctions remained in place. [Another possibility is that
other nations, including American adversaries, could use Instex as a
model in the future and avoid the U.S. financial system
entirely.]{.underline} "[The development of Instex is really worrying
for U.S. sanction policy in the long run]{.underline}," said Emma
Ashford, a research fellow at the Cato Institute in Washington. "Instex
sets up a framework other countries can use in the future." Officials at
the State Department and the National Security Council declined to
comment on the possibility of new sanctions. Nuclear Deal [Punishing the
STFI could doom Instex because it raises the possibility of sanctions
risk to anyone who's a part of the European mechanism]{.underline}. The
initiative drives home a letter sent by the U.S. Treasury Department in
early May to Per Fischer, the president of Instex, arguing that the
financial body could face sanctions. European officials say that
establishing Instex is imperative to keep Iran abiding by the nuclear
deal, which they credit with restraining the Islamic Republic's nuclear
capabilities. They're especially eager to get it up and running before
early July, when Iran has threatened to abandon the accord unless it
sees greater benefits from abiding by its terms. Visa Restrictions [The
U.S. has sent conflicting signals about its attitude toward Instex, with
some officials taking a hard line and others saying it could be
acceptable]{.underline}. During a stop in Berlin on May 31, Secretary of
State Michael Pompeo said the vehicle was "unproblematic" as long as
it's used to facilitate trade in humanitarian goods and other
transactions the U.S. has exempted from sanctions. Yet Republican hawks
in the administration and Congress disagree, saying that channels for
humanitarian trade with Iran already exist. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is
considering a draft bill that threatens sanctions against the European
and Iranian finance vehicles. Skeptics point out that Iran's Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps, covered by existing sanctions, has used
humanitarian front companies in the past. The risk of crushing Instex
now is that the U.S. could face an even greater backlash if it closes
off an avenue for legitimate humanitarian trade, according to Suzanne
Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings
Institution. "[It does call into question what the long-term strategy
here is]{.underline}," Maloney said. "If there's no room for
humanitarian aid for Iran, literally no viable mechanisms for
facilitating those transactions, [then clearly this is purely a punitive
strategy and one that is intended to wreak maximum havoc on the Iranian
population."]{.underline}

#### INSTEX Solves

\["Europe Circumvents U.S. Sanctions On Iran," *Forbes,* 6-30-2019, URL:

[Europe has found a way of circumventing U.S. sanctions on
Iran.]{.underline} The governments of [France, Germany and the United
Kingdom have developed a special purpose vehicle]{.underline} (SPV)
[to]{.underline} enable European businesses to [maintain non-dollar
trade with Iran without breaking U.S. sanctions]{.underline}. That SPV,
[known as INSTEX]{.underline}, is now up and running. The [three
governments announced the successful implementation of INSTEX at a
meeting of the Joint Commission of the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of]{.underline} Action (JCPOA) on June 28, 2019. The meeting was chaired
on behalf of the EU by the Secretary General of the European External
Action Service (EEAS), Helga Schmid, and was attended by representatives
of China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Iran. In a
statement, Schmid said: [France, Germany and the United Kingdom informed
participants that INSTEX had been made operational and available to all
EU Member States and that the first transactions are being
processed]{.underline}. Ongoing complementary cooperation with the
Iranian corresponding entity (STFI), which has already been established,
will speed up. They confirmed that some EU Member States were in the
[process of joining INSTEX as shareholders, the special purpose vehicle
aimed at facilitating legitimate business with Iran]{.underline}. They
are also working to open INSTEX to economic operators from third
countries. JCPOA is better known as the "Iran nuclear deal." The U.S.
unilaterally withdrew from JCPOA in May 2018, when it reimposed
sanctions on Iran's oil export sector. [But other countries, including
EU member states, have so far declined to follow suit. They claim that
Iran is complying with the terms of the deal, and the U.S.'s decision to
reimpose sanctions was unjustified.]{.underline} When the U.S. withdrew
from JCPOA, it said that companies breaking the reimposed sanctions
would face stiff penalties. [Among the companies the U.S. administration
listed as potential sanctions-breakers was the Brussels-based
international messaging service SWIFT, which is the lifeblood of
international payments]{.underline}. In November, evidently concerned
about the potential consequences for global payments if the U.S.
retaliated against it, SWIFT announced that it would comply with U.S.
sanctions: In keeping with our mission of supporting the resilience and
integrity of the global financial system as a global and neutral service
provider, Swift is suspending certain Iranian banks' access to the
messaging system. [This step, while regrettable, has been taken in the
interest of the stability and integrity of the wider global financial
system.]{.underline} This was widely seen as a setback for the EU, which
had been hoping that SWIFT would defy the U.S. and maintain payment
services to Iran. [But European governments were still determined to
find a way of keeping trade with Iran going. If SWIFT wouldn't help,
they would create something to replace SWIFT for Iranian trade. Thus,
INSTEX was born.]{.underline} Exactly how does INSTEX facilitate trade
with Iran without making sanctions-busting cross-border payments? [In a
word -- barter**. INSTEX matches the Euro payments of companies buying
goods from Iran with the Euro receipts of companies selling goods to
Iran.**]{.underline} Imagine a company based in France wants to sell
transport equipment to a buyer in Iran. Receiving [Euro payments
directly from that buyer would break U.S. sanctions. So instead, the
French company would register the sale documentation with
INSTE]{.underline}X. INSTEX would look on its own books for a company
buying foodstuffs from Iran. [It would match the two cash flows so that
in effect the two European companies pay each other. The goods would
still travel to and from Iran, but the money would stay entirely within
the EU.]{.underline} On the Iranian side, [INSTEX is mirrored by a
similar SPV, known as STFI. STFI would likewise match incoming and
outgoing transactions. So the two Iranian entities would also
effectively pay each other.]{.underline} Thus, everyone would receive
their goods and payments, but no money would cross the Iranian border.
**[INSTEX will most likely facilitate trade by smaller firms, especially
in humanitarian produce (food, medicines), at least to start with.
However, trade volumes need to be high enough for INSTEX to be able to
match cash flows reliably]{.underline}**. If volumes fall too low, or
become significantly imbalanced, there would be payment delays and
potentially solvency problems for INSTEX itself. [European governments,
concerned that companies might be reluctant to use INSTEX for fear of
U.S. retaliation, have therefore taken two further steps to encourage
its use.]{.underline} [**Firstly, they have created a "diplomatic
shield**." INSTEX is explicitly backed by the three sponsoring
governments, and its governing council consists of high-level government
officials]{.underline}. The JCPOA statement also reveals that other
**[EU countries are becoming shareholders of INSTEX]{.underline}**. The
idea is that the U.S. would find it diplomatically difficult to pressure
companies whose governments are backing INSTEX. [Admittedly, the present
U.S. administration has shown little concern for diplomatic niceties: if
a country does something it doesn't like, it retaliates.]{.underline} It
is therefore unclear how effective this "diplomatic shield" will be.
Secondly, as the JCPOA statement indicated, the aim is to open [INSTEX
to third countries. China and Russia were both present at the meeting,
and both have an interest in trading with Iran.]{.underline}
**[Crucially, their trade could include]{.underline}** oil. The European
Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) observes that "[the SPV is more
likely to succeed if it links with revenues related to Iran's oil
exports to countries such as China, India, and Japan."]{.underline}
Washington has not yet responded to the announcement that INSTEX is up
and running. [But it could regard such defiance of its stance on Iran as
an unfriendly act, particularly as tensions escalate between the two
countries over the shooting down of an American drone.]{.underline}
Arguably, by helping companies circumvent sanctions, the EU is inviting
retaliatory action. But should the U.S. really be able to force other
countries to follow its lead when those countries fundamentally disagree
with its stance? The fact that INSTEX\'s implementation went ahead
despite President Trump imposing additional sanctions on Iran shows how
little support there is in Europe for the U.S. administration\'s
belligerence. [If INSTEX also succeeds in attracting major third
countries such as China, the U.S. may find itself increasingly isolated.
This could call into question not only the relationship between the U.S.
and its allies, but also the U.S.\'s power in the world.]{.underline}

The first transaction on I[nstex]{.underline}, Europe\'s trade channel
for doing business with Iran despite U.S. sanctions, is expected to
happen in the next few days. But [will it work to save the Iran nuclear
deal? Iran says it\'s ramping up its nuclear program because U.S.
sanctions are keeping it from getting the benefits promised in the 2015
nuclear deal.]{.underline} And [**that\'s where something called Instex
comes in**. It\'s]{.underline} a financial office that Europe set up to
[try to continue doing at least a little business with Iran despite U.S.
sanctions.]{.underline} NPR\'s Deborah Amos joins us from Berlin, where
she\'s been reporting on it. And, Deb, first, the basics, right? Instex
is a bank or a trade office. What exactly is it? DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE:
Very simply, [it\'s a barter system created by the French, the Germans
and the Brits. So in any trade, money gets paid into the home country\'s
account, and it doesn\'t cross the border in or out of
Iran]{.underline}. There\'s also an office in Tehran, too. So the idea
is this gets around the U.S.-dominated international trading system. [So
companies that want to do business in Iran, they have another
avenue]{.underline}. It took more than a year to set this thing up.
**[Nobody\'s ever done it before. And it\'s complicated]{.underline}**.
The Europeans announced last week that Instex is up and running, and the
first trade is expected soon. CORNISH[: Why is this
necessary]{.underline}? Is there no other way around the U.S. system?
AMOS: Well, **[the Europeans still support the nuclear deal. So they say
it keeps Iran from building a bomb]{.underline}**. The U.S. wants a
tougher deal. [Trump]{.underline} walked away from it last year, and he
re-imposed these punishing sanctions. And he [threatened that any
company doing business with Iran will get shut out of the much bigger
U.S. market.]{.underline} And so at the same time, the U.S. threatened
the Europeans. They say Instex OK as long as it doesn\'t trade anything
but food and medicine. [You know, these are the items that aren\'t on
the sanction list, but companies and banks in Europe are so scared of
U.S. punishment that they need cover from Instex, and that\'s what it
gives them.]{.underline} And **[their own government gives them
cover]{.underline}**, too. The problem is the Iranians don\'t like the
limits. And they say if Europe doesn\'t come up with more economic
benefits, it\'s going to take another step away from the nuclear deal.
CORNISH: What does the U.S. have to say about Instex now that it\'s
close to operation? AMOS: [They don\'t say a whole lot. They\'re
downplaying this because what they say is, you know, who
cares?]{.underline} Food and medicine aren\'t banned anyway. And they
continue to say no oil sales at all because the shutting down of oil
sales is part of Washington\'s policy of maximum pressure. CORNISH:
Well, that\'s the geopolitics, but what about the business side? I mean,
how are businesses reacting to the idea of this? AMOS: Well, here\'s the
problem in this whole setup. You know, [European governments have a
foreign policy, and it is that they support the nuclear
deal]{.underline}. But you can\'t make private businesses take a risk
that they don\'t want to take. They are worried about getting shut out
of the U.S. market, much bigger than Iran. **[And so what you see is
small companies may take the risk, companies that have already been
trading with Iran]{.underline}**. But it will not be big. It certainly
won\'t answer Iran\'s question, which is, why aren\'t we getting the
economic benefits that we were promised in the nuclear deal? And,
Europe, you are still for this deal, so why aren\'t you doing more?
CORNISH: So right now, Iran is saying that by this weekend, by Sunday,
they are ready to surpass another limit that was in the nuclear
agreement. So in the end, can Instex do what Europe hoped it would?
AMOS: Maybe yes, maybe no. But at the moment, Iran is saying no, so
that\'s a bad sign because for them, oil is the big deal. But the
**[Europeans hope that this could be a face-saving thing to buy some
time. And the fact that everybody is still talking about Instex, the
fact that we\'re talking about Instex, it may be that that is the only
game in town.]{.underline}**

#### JCPOA is still alive but continued Iran only cares about economic relief and will nuclearize. Continued growth of INSTEX is key to appeasing Iranian interests.

BRUSSELS --- [Scrambling to save the nuclear agreement with Iran,
European foreign ministers declared]{.underline} Monday [**that Iranian
breaches so far were not serious enough to take steps that could lead to
reimposed international sanctions and a collapse of the accord.** That
conclusion]{.underline}, reached at a meeting in Brussels, effectively
**[extended a lifeline for the 2015 nuclear agreement in defiance of
pressure by the Trump administration.]{.underline}** The agreement has
been increasingly imperiled since the United States abandoned the accord
more than a year ago and renewed its own sanctions on Iran. The European
Union ministers reiterated their view that **[the agreement was the only
option for curbing Iran's nuclear program.]{.underline}** In recent
weeks [Iran has exceeded the amount and purity of the uranium it is
permitted under the accord]{.underline}, transgressions confirmed by the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The Iranians have said they intend
to breach the limits even more **[unless they get what the accord
promised Iran: economic relief.]{.underline}** Triggering the
dispute-resolution article in the accord would start a process that
could lead to the restoration of all the sanctions placed on Iran. That,
many analysts say, would almost certainly would doom the agreement. [The
European reluctance to use the provision came despite pressure from both
the United States and Israel, which say Iran's breaches are a signal of
the country's intent to move toward the capacity to make an atomic
bomb.]{.underline} Under the accord, [**Iran has vowed to never seek
such a weapon.** "For the time being, none of the parties to the
agreement has signaled their intention to invoke this
article,"]{.underline} Federica Mogherini, the European Union's top
foreign policy official, told a news conference after the foreign
ministers meeting in Brussels. Ms. Mogherini said that "[none of them,
for the moment, for the time being, with the current data we have
had]{.underline}" believe that there [has been "significant
noncompliance."]{.underline} The conclusion was quickly denounced by
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, whose government regards
Iran as the country's most serious security threat. "The European
Union's response to Iranian violations reminds me of the European
appeasement of the 1930s," Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement reported by
Israeli news media. "There are probably some in Europe who will not wake
up until Iranian missiles fall on European soil. Then it probably will
be too late." Ms. Mogherini, echoing the view of the meeting's
participants, said that [the nuclear deal was still the only available
option. **"The deal has avoided Iran developing a nuclear weapon, and
today everyone recognizes that there is no alternative**]{.underline},"
she said. "This is the most dramatic and difficult stage." Jeremy Hunt,
Britain's foreign secretary, said he saw little time left to save the
deal. ["Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear
bomb,"]{.underline} Mr. Hunt said. "There is still some closing[, but
small window to keep the deal alive." **The European participants in the
deal --- Britain, France and Germany --- issued a joint statement Sunday
evening that said they were still committed to it**]{.underline}. They
expressed regret that the United States had reimposed sanctions on Iran
"even though that country had implemented its commitments under the
agreement." "We believe that the time has come to act responsibly and to
seek ways to stop the escalation of tension and resume dialogue," the
three countries said in the statement. But the Iranian foreign minister,
Mohammad Javad Zarif, said that he saw little reason to be optimistic
that the Europeans could save the agreement --- known formally as the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action --- by alleviating the punishing
effects of American sanctions against Iran. "[The Europeans claim they
were willing to maintain the J.C.P.O.A., but we have not seen Europe yet
to be ready for an investment]{.underline}," he said on Sunday after
arriving in New York for a meeting of the United Nations, Iran's
state-run Press TV reported. Mr. Zarif, who was educated in the United
States, speaks colloquial English and has extensive contacts in Western
media and foreign policy circles, has long vexed the Trump
administration, which accuses him of spreading lies. It has considered
placing sanctions on Mr. Zarif, a move that would sever an important
diplomatic conduit with the United States. In a sign of the antipathy,
administration officials granted Mr. Zarif a restrictive visa that
limits him to the United Nations headquarters, the Iranian Mission and
the Iranian ambassador's residence. "They are worried about Mr. Zarif's
influential work trips and his media interviews, and the impact it will
have on American public opinion," said Seyed Abbas Mousavi, an Iran
Foreign Ministry spokesman. \[Here are excerpt from an interview Mr.
Zarif gave The New York Times in which he discussed the deal.\] [Iran
has sent mixed signals about its intentions in recent]{.underline} days,
with **[President Hassan Rouhani expressing a willingness to open new
talks with Washington --- once sanctions are removed.]{.underline}** "We
are always ready for negotiation," he said in a televised speech. "The
moment you stop sanctions and bullying, we are ready to negotiate." But
a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Behrouz
Kamalvandi, said Monday that **[unless Europe could salvage the deal,
his country would return its nuclear program to its status before the
accord.]{.underline}** Its uranium stockpile was much larger then, and
some was much more highly enriched. Tensions with Tehran have
intensified since President Trump withdrew the United States from the
accord in May 2018 and reimposed American economic sanctions that had
been lifted under the deal. Mr. Trump imposed additional sanctions this
year, trying to stop Iran's ability to sell oil, a pillar of its
economy. Britain, France and Germany have made a commitment to ease the
impact of American sanctions, but so far have not found an effective
way. [The centerpiece of their efforts is the creation of a kind of
exchange that would allow European companies to do business with Iran in
a way that bypasses the American banking system.]{.underline} Tehran has
said that the system, known as Instex, is inadequate. Arriving at the
meeting of Europeans on Monday, Josep Borrell, the Spanish foreign
minister and nominee to become the European Union's foreign affairs
chief, said, ["We will do what we can to guarantee that there is no
economic embargo against Iran and that European companies can continue
working there."]{.underline} "It's very difficult because U.S. laws
applied in an extraterritorial manner, in a way that we don't recognize,
make it difficult," he said, adding that Spain would join the Instex
mechanism. Despite the renewed American sanctions, Iran complied with
its commitments under the nuclear deal for a year after Mr. Trump's
withdrawal. But the confrontation has escalated since the American
president imposed further sanctions. **[Iran warned that it would stop
complying with the deal's caps on its enriched uranium stockpile unless
the Europeans made good on their promises]{.underline}**. The European
countries were unable to deliver, and Iran surpassed the limits this
month.

#### Russia's support for adding oil to INSTEX trades satisfies Iranian leadership

[Russia has signalled its willingness to join an EU payments channel
designed to circumvent US sanctions banning trade with Iran
and]{.underline} has called on Brussels [to expand the new mechanism to
cover oil exports. **Moscow's involvement in the channel, known as
Instex, would mark a significant step forward in attempts by the EU and
Russia to rescue a 2015 Iran nuclear**]{.underline} deal that has been
unravelling since the Trump administration abandoned it last year.
"Russia is interested in close co-ordination with the European Union on
Instex," the Russian foreign ministry told the Financial Times. "[The
more countries and continents involved, the more effective will the
mechanism be as a whole." "This is an important project,"]{.underline}
Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's spokesman, told reporters on Thursday.
"[When it is activated, we cannot rule out interaction in this
regard]{.underline}." The new payment system was designed to help
European companies fend off "illegal attempts to restrict their
activities," he added. [Iran has expressed frustration that the
remaining signatories to the nuclear deal have not done more to give it
relief from economic sanctions reimposed by the US,]{.underline}
particularly restrictions on its ability to export oil. It has
underlined its discontent by breaching limits agreed in the accord on
its uranium enrichment processes. Mohammad Javad Zarif, [Iran's foreign
minister, has described Instex as "not sufficient".]{.underline}
Speaking in New York on Thursday, Mr Zarif said Instex "may not resolve
our problem" [because it could not facilitate oil exports.]{.underline}
"Unless oil goes into Instex, it can't be substantial . . . [without
oil, there is no substantial trade,]{.underline}" Mr Zarif told
reporters at the Iranian mission to the UN. Moscow's support for Instex
prompted a warning from US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who
attended a G7 financial meeting in France. "If you want to participate
in the dollar system you abide by US sanctions," Mr Mnuchin said, after
discussing Iran with his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire. "We want to
make sure that Instex is very careful on diligence and not doing
anything that would run into issues of our sanctions." He noted that
exports to Iran for humanitarian purposes were still permitted. The US
is unhappy that the European nations are moving ahead with Instex but
officials are confident the mechanism cannot provide serious relief for
Iran. "One of the most painful . . . impacts on the Iranian economy is
the lack of what they thought was going to be very, very significant
European investment," said one senior US official, who added that the
Trump administration was happy that the European companies had decided
that it was not worth taking the risk. [The landmark nuclear deal, known
as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, lifted a series of punishing
international sanctions on Iran in return for Tehran's agreement to curb
its nuclear programme.]{.underline} Sanctions have devastated the
Iranian economy since they were reimposed by Washington, in part by
halting a big portion of Iran's oil exports, its most valuable
commodity. [Russia has strengthened its ties with Iran in recent years
as part of Moscow's increased geopolitical importance in the Middle
East, including its role of propping up the Assad regime in the war in
Syria.]{.underline} At a meeting with Iran's president Hassan Rouhani
last month, Russian president Vladimir [Putin vowed to continue
developing trade ties with Tehran]{.underline} and said Moscow was
committed to a project to expand the Bushehr nuclear plant in Iran.
**[Efforts to rescue the nuclear deal have been a rare area of
co-operation between Brussels and Moscow,]{.underline}** whose relations
soured after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, the attempted murder of
a former Russian double agent in the UK and alleged attempts to meddle
in EU elections. Since US president Donald Trump pulled out of the deal
last May, its other signatories --- Germany, France, UK, China and
Russia --- have scrambled to find ways to maintain trade with Iran. But
they have been stymied by companies' reluctance to risk Washington's
wrath. Instex was launched in January but subsequently delayed by
bureaucratic hurdles and the complications caused by the US sanctions.
It only became operational last month and has been criticised by Tehran
for having big limitations. The idea is to set up a so-called mirror
image transaction system that replaces potentially sanctionable payments
between Europe and Iran with ones that do not cross Iran's borders.
[Just 10 EU states are members and the mechanism's initial credit line
of several million euros is a fraction of EU-Iran trade, which stood at
more than €20bn annually before the US sanctions. **Brussels is
interested in bringing Russia into Instex,**]{.underline} two EU
officials told the Financial Times, but they said that it would first
seek to get the channel up and running with humanitarian aid trades
before potentially expanding its scope or membership. Federica
Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy head, said this week that the trade
mechanism "has always been conceived to be open to third countries."
["The issue of whether or not Instex will deal with oil is a discussion
that is ongoing among the shareholders]{.underline}," she added. [Iran
wants Europe to buy its oil so that it can use the hard currency
earnings to import basic commodities and medicines through
Instex.]{.underline} Recommended [Moscow has previously said that it
would look into ways to facilitate or finance Iranian oil exports if
Instex was not launched or proved to be ineffective.]{.underline}
Analysts said China, which has shown a willingness to defy US sanctions,
has greater potential to hand Tehran an economic lifeline by continuing
to purchase Iranian crude exports.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - [The remaining parties to the Iran nuclear deal do
not see Tehran's breaches as significant and do not intend for now to
trigger the pact's dispute mechanism, preferring more diplomacy to ease
the crisis]{.underline}, the EU foreign policy chief said on Monday. She
spoke at the end of an European Union foreign ministers meeting after
Britain said [there was only a "small window" of time to salvage the
deal]{.underline}, while Iran warned it would ramp up uranium enrichment
if the EU failed to do more to that end. [U.S.-Iranian tensions have
escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump decided last year to abandon
the nuclear deal]{.underline} under which Iran agreed to curtail its
atomic program in return for relief from economic sanctions crippling
its economy. The EU ministers drew no conclusions on what action should
next be taken to head off a feared U.S.-Iranian conflict. But by
suggesting that Iran's non-compliance was not significant, it could
anger the United States, which last week warned it would intensify
sanctions on Iran over its breaches, and it did prompt an immediate
outcry from Israel, Iran's regional arch-enemy. ["For the time being,
none of the parties to the agreement has signaled their intention to
invoke this article]{.underline}," EU foreign policy chief Federica
Mogherini told a news conference in Brussels, [referring to a mechanism
to punish non-compliance.]{.underline} "([It) means that none of them
for the moment, for the time being with the current data we have had in
particular from the (U.N. nuclear watchdog) IAEA, (consider Iran's)
non-compliance\...to be significant non-compliance."]{.underline}
NUCLEAR BREACHES [IAEA inspectors last week confirmed Iran is now
enriching uranium to 4.5% fissile purity, above the 3.67% limit set by
its deal]{.underline}, the second breach in as many weeks after Tehran
exceeded limits on its stock of low enriched uranium. The level at which
Iran is now refining uranium is still well below the 20% purity of
enrichment Iran reached before the deal, and the 90% needed to yield
bomb-grade nuclear fuel. Low-enriched uranium provides fuel for civilian
power plants. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said earlier in the
day that Iran remained "a good year away from developing a nuclear
bomb". He told reporters in Brussels: **["There is still some closing,
but small window to keep the deal alive."]{.underline}** Under the terms
of the deal[, if any party believes another is not upholding their
commitments they can refer the issue to a Joint Commission comprising
Iran, Russia, China, the three European powers, and the European Union.
**This activates a dispute mechanism that could eventually end with a
restoration of global, U.N. sanctions against**]{.underline} Iran.
Mogherini said a joint commission meeting was possible, although when
and at what level had yet to be decided. **[She indicated that for now
the EU would focus on diplomatic efforts to save the nuclear deal, which
signatories in 2015 touted as essential to ward off the risk of a wider
Middle East war jeopardizing global energy supplies. "The deal is not in
good health, but it's still alive.]{.underline}** We hope and we invite
Iran to reverse these steps and go back to full compliance with the
agreement," Mogherini, adding that they were all reversible.
"APPEASEMENT" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the
EU's response on Monday, saying it recalled failed diplomacy with Nazi
Germany in the run-up to World War Two. "(It) reminds me of the European
appeasement of the 1930s," Netanyahu said in a video statement. "Then,
too, there were those who stuck their head in the sand and did not see
the approaching danger," said Netanyahu, who has often cast Iran's
nuclear projects as a mortal menace to Israel and the wider world. Iran
denies seeking a nuclear bomb. [The Brussels gathering had been called
to flesh out ways of convincing Iran and the United States to reduce
tensions]{.underline} and start a dialogue amid fears the 2015 deal is
close to collapse. Fears of direct U.S.-Iranian conflict have risen
since May with several attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf, Iran's
downing of a U.S. surveillance drone, and a plan for U.S. air strikes on
Iran last month that Trump called off at the last minute. [In reaction
to the reimposition of tough U.S. sanctions, which have notably targeted
Iran's vital oil revenue stream, Tehran has cut some of its nuclear
commitments under the deal. **That led the European parties to the pact,
France, Britain and Germany, to warn Tehran not to shred the deal's
terms.**]{.underline} Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom
suggested the [Europeans would leave the door open for diplomacy but
that Tehran should exercise restraint. **"It improves their chances of
having a good discussion with the EU and other partners in the JCPOA
(Iran deal),"**]{.underline} she told reporters. "[We encourage them to
use all diplomatic means and create new diplomatic channels \...to
de-escalate the tense situation]{.underline}. We have to use every
opportunity to keep the deal." The Islamic Republic's nuclear energy
agency said Tehran would return to the situation before the nuclear deal
unless European countries fulfilled their obligations. **["These actions
are not taken out of stubbornness but to give diplomacy a
chance]{.underline}**," agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said. ["And
if the Europeans and America don't want to fulfil their commitments we
will create a balance in this deal by reducing commitments and return
the situation to four years ago."]{.underline} Iran says the European
countries must do more to guarantee it the trade and investment
dividends it was due to receive in return for U.N.-monitored limits to
its nuclear capacity under the deal.

[EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels Monday declared that breaches
of the 2015 nuclear deal by Iran were so far not serious enough to
trigger the pact's dispute mechanism,]{.underline} opting for more
diplomacy to ease the crisis. Speaking to reporters in Brussels at the
end of a meeting of EU foreign ministers, the bloc\'s current diplomatic
chief Federica Mogherini said the [steps taken by Iran so far \--
including enriching uranium above the 3.67 percent ceiling set by the
2015 nuclear deal \-- **were reversible.**]{.underline} For now, none of
the remaining parties have triggered the formal dispute mechanism,
[meaning that they did not regard Iran\'s breaches up to now as
\"significant non-compliance]{.underline}\" under the terms of the deal,
said Mogherini. Tensions in the Gulf have soared since last year, when
the US pulled out of the 2015 deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran,
hammering its economy and prompting Tehran to break limits on uranium
enrichment and stockpiling. [**The EU is desperately trying to prevent
the deal unravelling completely**, seeing it as the best way to stop
Tehran acquiring atomic weapons]{.underline}, and the **[issue was top
of the agenda]{.underline}** as ministers from the bloc met in Brussels.
French President Emmanuel Macron, on a visit to Belgrade, said he would
speak with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Russian President
Vladimir Putin this week in a bid to salvage the accord. Iran demands
sanctions relief [But Iran piled fresh pressure on Europe, demanding
concrete measures to give it relief from US sanctions and threatening to
return its nuclear programme]{.underline} to where it was before the
curbs imposed by the 2015 deal. British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt
\-- who held phone talks with his US and Iranian counterparts at the
weekend \-- **[insisted \"the deal isn\'t dead yet\".]{.underline}**
\"[Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon. We
think there is still some closing but small window to keep the deal
alive]{.underline},\" Hunt told reporters. Britain, France and Germany
\-- [the three European parties to the deal]{.underline} \-- on Sunday
[issued a joint statement calling for dialogue to resolve the crisis.
Iran has repeatedly warned it could leave the deal unless the remaining
parties bypass US sanctions to deliver the promised economic benefits
and on Monday threatened to take its nuclear programme back to its
pre-deal status.]{.underline} \"If the Europeans and the Americans
don\'t want to carry out their duties\... we will decrease our
commitments and\... reverse the conditions to four years ago,\" Iranian
atomic energy agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said, quoted by IRNA
state news agency. The US has vowed to pursue its \"maximum pressure\"
campaign against Iran, but Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell \--
lined up to be the next EU diplomatic chief \-- warned its strategy is
only \"strengthening the most radical\" elements in the Islamic
republic. European trading mechanism fails to provide relief [Europe
hopes to use a special trading mechanism called INSTEX to enable
businesses to deal with Iran without using the US dollar or financial
system]{.underline}, thereby helping the Iranian economy while avoiding
Washington\'s sanctions. But the mechanism is complicated, no
transactions have been finalised yet and it can for now only be used for
humanitarian goods \-- food and pharmaceuticals, for example \-- though
Mogherini said the shareholding countries were discussing extending it
to Iran\'s crucial oil sector. The sweeping nature of the US measures
has scared many major European businesses out of Iran despite Brussels\'
insistence that American sanctions do not apply in Europe. \"Iran has
taken bad decisions in response to the bad decision of the United States
to pull out of the deal and reimpose sanctions, whose
extraterritoriality strikes at the economic advantages the country got
from the deal,\" French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian said as he
arrived in Brussels. [The Iranian foreign ministry warned in a statement
that its compliance with the deal was \"rooted in the principle of
reciprocity**\" and demanded Europe come up with \"practical, effective
and responsible decisions\".**]{.underline} EU ministers insisted Iran
must return to respecting its obligations under the deal in full,
rejecting a suggestion by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani that both
sides could reduce their commitments. \"This is a very, very serious
situation[. We must make it clear once again, in clear language, that
there is only a chance if Iran commits itself unreservedly to what is

minister Michael Roth told reporters. But the Iranian foreign ministry
statement branded the European expectations \"unrealistic\", [demanding

\-- including exceeding a 300-kilo (660-pound) limit on enriched uranium

Tehran\'s breaches, Hunt said.

At the end of the Cold War, the United States appeared to be standing on
the precipice of a new era of peace and prosperity as the world's sole
superpower. [Intoxicated by the sense that American primacy would allow
them to remake the world as they wished, U.S. leaders embraced liberal
hegemony]{.underline}. [They aimed to discourage others from challenging
American power]{.underline} and sought to spread democracy and liberal
economics within an American sphere of influence that encompassed most
of the world. **[We can't know what the world would have looked like if
they had chosen a different course.]{.underline}** But we do know that,
today, [relations with Russia and China are bad,]{.underline} and
getting worse. There is now open talk of a new Cold War---with both
nations, a feat that we mostly managed to avoid in the last Cold War.
Meanwhile, [nationalist movements are on the rise]{.underline}, and the
[European Union and other multilateral bodies seem
unsteady]{.underline}, at best. And, last but not least, the [Middle
East remains in turmoil]{.underline}---more than 16 years after George
W. Bush sent U.S. troops into Iraq. There is violence and suffering
everywhere, it seems---and there is no end in sight. Indeed, according
to a panel of 12 experts commissioned by Congress to review U.S. foreign
policy, "[the security and wellbeing of the United States are at greater
risk than at any time in decades." The nation, they continue, "confronts
a grave crisis";]{.underline} "the strategic landscape is growing
steadily more threatening." In The Hell of Good Intentions, Stephen Walt
traces many of these problems to the very policies that these men and
women advocate. U[.S. power has allowed American officials to pursue
ambitious foreign policy goals, even when those goals are unnecessary or
doomed to]{.underline} fail. And "liberal hegemony...failed because it
rested on mistaken views of how international politics actually works."
In particular, he explains, "[it exaggerated America's ability to
reshape other societies]{.underline} and underestimated the ability of
weaker actors to thwart U.S. aims." It also rested on the willingness of
the American people to support the strategy indefinitely, even as the
costs rose and the benefits became less apparent. Although Walt allows
that "most [foreign policy professionals]{.underline} are genuine
patriots who seek to make the world a better place," [as a
group]{.underline} they [operate **as "a dysfunctional caste of
privileged insiders who are frequently disdainful of alternative
perspectives**]{.underline} and [insulated both professionally and
personally from the consequences of the policies they
promote."]{.underline} Donald J. Trump seemed to agree. Since the Cold
War, he said in late April 2016, as he closed in on the GOP presidential
nomination, ["foolishness and arrogance...led to one foreign policy
disaster after another]{.underline}." He pledged, if elected, to "look
for talented experts with new approaches, and practical ideas," not
"those who have perfect résumés but very little to brag about except
responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued
losses at war." The Perils of Our Liberal Hegemony Trump might have been
more successful at changing U.S. foreign policy if he had had a better
understanding of what it was, and what, exactly, was wrong with it.
Before he embarked upon his quixotic presidential campaign, or any time
since, he would have benefited from having read anything that Walt---or,
for that matter, countless other serious critics of U.S. foreign
policy---had been writing for years. [Before he appointed John Bolton as
his national security adviser, or tapped Mike Pompeo to be his secretary
of state, Trump might have questioned whether the policies that they
advocated were likely to deliver better results]{.underline} than those
favored by their Bush 43 or Obama predecessors. Instead, [Trump and his
team mostly fell into the same bad habits]{.underline}, favoring
military power and threats over diplomacy and peaceful global
engagement. [His embrace of the American military, and often of American
militarism, is reflective of the **foreign policy establishment's
activist bias**. "The United States,"]{.underline} Walt explains,
"[routinely errs on the side of doing too much rather than too
little."]{.underline} The U.S. military isn't merely the favored
instrument of this activism; oftentimes, it seems to be the only one.
According to the 12-member National Defense Strategy Commission, "U.S.
military power has been indispensable to global peace and
stability---and to America's own security, prosperity, and global
leadership." Later the report avers that America's unmatched military
strength---as opposed to its vibrant economy, dynamic culture, or
cherished values---"has given the United States unrivaled influence on a
wide range of global issues." [Walt credits the Cato
Institute]{.underline}, my intellectual home for the past 15 years, [as
"the only major inside-the-Beltway think tank that consistently
challenges" the bipartisan elite consensus]{.underline}. Otherwise,
notes Vox's Zack Beauchamp, **["Washington's foreign policy debate"
typically revolves around "how much force America should use rather than
whether it should use it at all...."]{.underline}** Others have
commented on these tendencies. "[Because Washington think tank analysts
and public intellectuals mostly answer to political
masters,"]{.underline} explain Benjamin H. Friedman and Justin Logan,
"**[they have no incentive to buck the conventional
line]{.underline}**.... [They focus on operational questions about how
to implement \[liberal hegemony\] unlike academic analysts, who debate
the merits of alternative grand strategies."]{.underline} These
alternative grand strategies---including "restraint" or Walt's preferred
approach, "offshore balancing"---challenge the claim that the United
States must maintain preponderant military power not merely to deter
attacks against itself, but also to discourage other countries from
taking steps to defend themselves and their interests. Whereas Trump and
many of his supporters decry this as feckless free riding, abetted by
foolish U.S. policies, the defenders of these very policies explain that
they are functioning as intended. [The promise of security that America
extends to others]{.underline}, explains the Brookings Institution's
Robert Kagan, encourages U.S. [allies to "spend less on defense and more
on strengthening their economies and social welfare
systems."]{.underline} Hal Brands, a professor at Johns Hopkins School
of Advanced International Studies, and the author of American Grand
Strategy in the Age of Trump, agrees. American protection, Brands
writes, "allows other countries to underbuild their militaries." This
approach finds little favor among Americans struggling to reconcile the
nation's ambitious ends with massive, but still limited, means.
Americans can be counted on to "support the troops" at sporting events
or when boarding flights at airports. They can even be roused for the
occasional short, sharp war. But they've soured on protracted and
indecisive conflicts in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. There is, in
other words, some public support for the use of force, under precise
circumstances, but not in the service of vague principles of
international order and the wellbeing of allies. Walt understands this
well. "Given the country's providential geopolitical position and
fortunate history," he explains, "convincing Americans to pursue liberal
hegemony should be a tough sell." "To make that sale," he continues[,
"its advocates have to convince the public that liberal hegemony is
necessary, affordable, and morally desirable]{.underline}." The case
typically involves inflating the threats, exaggerating the benefits, and
concealing the costs. "If Americans become convinced that minor problems
are really existential hazards, they will squander vast sums chasing
monsters of their own imagining," Walt writes. "Even worse, policymakers
may take preventive actions that are in fact counterproductive...."
Next, defenders of liberal hegemony maintain that it "will enhance U.S.
security, increase American prosperity, and spread basic liberal
values." Indeed, there is almost nothing that isn't made better by
American military power. "**[Threat inflation makes liberal hegemony
seem necessary; overstating its benefits makes it seem
desirable]{.underline}**. For its advocates, the last line of defense is
to claim that the strategy is cheap." Critically, [this entails
dismissing the massive opportunity costs of American military
power]{.underline}. Perhaps no one understood these better than
President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who, in the depths of the Cold War,
noted that "every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket
fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and
are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed." Ike generally
believed that such expenditures were necessary to fight and win the
contest with the Soviet Union, but he was constantly reminding "his
fellow citizens," Walt writes, "that they would face a bleaker future if
they ignored" the inherent tradeoffs "that overly ambitious foreign
policy goals entailed." [Blowback is another cost of America's overseas
military adventurism]{.underline}. This is a sensitive topic, and Walt
handles it well. "Most societies," he writes, "have trouble recognizing
that their own actions might be the cause of some other group's
hostility .... But ... [concealing the role U.S. policy plays in
provoking foreign opposition encourages Americans to understate the full
cost of liberal hegemony."]{.underline} Indeed, [assorted villains have
routinely justified attacks on Americans or U.S. interests on the
grounds that they are merely responding to American
aggression]{.underline}. That such claims are only partly true is
irrelevant; the point is that they find receptive ears among many
foreign audiences. Even some of the most fervent defenders of liberal
hegemony admit as much. For example, in the run-up to the war in Iraq,
Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz explained that **[anger at
American pressure on Iraq, and resentment over the stationing of U.S.
forces in Saudi Arabia, had "been Osama bin Laden's principal recruiting
device."]{.underline}** For the most part, the [American foreign policy
elite hasn't been called to task because the United States is so
powerful and wealthy that even big mistakes don't bring about our
ruin]{.underline} (at least not all at once). What's more,
"**[error-prone experts 'fail upward' and become more influential over
time]{.underline}**" while "people who do get things right can go
unrecognized and unrewarded, and they may even pay a considerable price
for bringing unpleasant truths to light." Related, [the debate is
stacked against advocates of restraint and non-intervention, and in
favor of the interventionists.]{.underline} Reversing these trends won't
be easy. "[Bad ideas persist]{.underline}," Walt notes, "[when powerful
interests have an incentive to keep them alive]{.underline}." Upton
Sinclair said it best: "It is difficult to get a man to understand
something when his salary depends on his not understanding it." Those
who seek to change U.S. foreign policy must, therefore, work to build "a
countervailing set of organizations and institutions that can do battle
in the marketplace of ideas." Such an undertaking, Walt admits, "will
require significant financial resources."
