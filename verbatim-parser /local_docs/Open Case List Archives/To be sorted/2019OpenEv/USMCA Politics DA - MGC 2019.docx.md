President Donald Trump's top legislative priority. Speaker Nancy
**[Pelosi]{.underline}** on Tuesday **[is expected to]{.underline}**
formally **[name lawmakers to the working groups]{.underline}** **[that
will work with the administration]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}**
the labor, environment and pharmaceutical **[provisions]{.underline}**
that **[Democrats]{.underline}** **[are seeking to
strengthen]{.underline}**. Pelosi has also emphasized the need for
strong enforcement mechanisms in the accord that will overhaul the North
American Free Trade Agreement. **[Ways and Means Chairman]{.underline}**
Richard **[Neal]{.underline}**, the Massachusetts Democrat leading talks
with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, **[said Monday he
hopes]{.underline}** **[a deal can be finalized within 30
days]{.underline}**. The Trump administration has signaled plans to send
a bill implementing the USMCA to Congress by the end of the month to
prod lawmakers to vote on it before the August recess. **[These signs of
progress come after Trump withdrew his threat to impose tariffs on
Mexican imports]{.underline}** over unrelated immigration concerns.
Senate Republicans applauded that decision, and Senate Finance Chairman
Chuck Grassley met Monday with Pelosi, Neal and Ways and Means
Republican Kevin Brady to discuss how to move forward on the USMCA. "We
just wanted to point out despite the chaotic nature of the tariff
situation, we still wanted to stitch this up," Neal said. Grassley
requested that meeting, and he told House Democrats he wants to be
helpful in completing the USMCA, according to a Democratic aide. Pelosi
used the meeting to explain the provisions that need to be reinforced to
get more House Democrats to support the deal, the aide said. "**[We want
to be on a path to yes," Pelosi said]{.underline}** at a Peterson
Foundation event Tuesday, stressing the need for strong enforcement. If
all parties can't be held to the agreement, she said, "you're just
having NAFTA with sprinkles on top." Economic Growth **[Grassley
described Monday's meeting with Pelosi as "very
successful."]{.underline}** "I think they're putting a good-faith effort
to work out differences," Grassley said of House Democrats. "There's a
process in place to do it. But those differences will have to be worked
out before we move it. The Senate Finance Committee will hold a hearing
June 18 with Lighthizer to discuss the USMCA, Grassley later said in a
statement. For weeks **[Republicans have said that the USMCA already has
enough votes to pass]{.underline}**, counting on a combination of
pro-trade lawmakers from both parties. Acting White House Chief of Staff
Mick **[Mulvaney said Tuesday "everybody knows it will pass the
House]{.underline}**," but suggested that Pelosi is holding out to get
not only a majority of the full House of Representatives, but also a
majority of her caucus.

#### Arms sales reductions spark massive fights in congress -- breaks bipartisanship

**Ahmed, 2018** (Akbar Shahid, foreign affairs reporter based in the
D.C. bureau of HuffPost, "Democrats Are Planning To Target The Arms
Sales Trump Loves," HuffPost, November 18,
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-democrats-arms-sales_n_5bf08cade4b0b84243e2d0da)

WASHINGTON ― **[Top Democrats are discussing how to]{.underline}** use
their upcoming control of the House of Representatives to **[more
tightly regulate U.S. weapons sales abroad]{.underline}** ― a move that
would shore up the party's antiwar credentials and make it harder for
President Donald Trump to continue his high-profile arms deals with
countries accused of human rights violations like Saudi Arabia. A final
plan has not yet been crafted, but conversations are underway, a
Democratic aide and an activist in regular contact with lawmakers told
HuffPost. The final decision rests with leadership: the speaker, likely
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), and a handful of figures like Rep. Jim
McGovern (D-Mass.), who will chair the powerful House Rules Committee
and who publicly supports greater debate over the arms trade. Trump's
executive branch is already required to inform key congressional
committees of any major weapons sale 30 days before U.S. and foreign
officials finalize terms. **[Capitol Hill can use legislation to block
the deal]{.underline}** within that period. **[Such a bill, even if
successful, would likely be vetoed by the president and then might not
win over a veto-proof majority of lawmakers]{.underline}** ― **[but the
general consensus is that simply initiating such a spectacle makes it
harder]{.underline}** for a sale to continue and creates pressure for it
to be abandoned instead. If there's no bill, the process automatically
moves forward. What some House members and outside groups skeptical of
the defense industry want to fix is a discrepancy between the two
chambers. **[In the Senate, any member can force the full body to
vote]{.underline}** on legislation disapproving of a sale 10 days after
a notification comes to Congress if the foreign relations committee has
not acted on it. **[Democrats have used that power repeatedly in
dramatic votes over U.S. weapons shipments]{.underline}** for a
controversial Saudi military campaign in Yemen, and Sen. Rand Paul
(R-Ky.) has deployed it to force debates that draw attention to his
libertarian views on foreign policy. But in the House, members who
introduce similar bills could see them get referred to the foreign
affairs committee and then simply never make it to a full floor vote.
Critics of the arms trade say this lets lawmakers avoid accountability
for deals that can allow weapons buyers to commit war crimes, and that
allow the defense industry to reap huge profits off research largely
funded by the U.S. taxpayer. "I'm for any more oversight we can add to
this process to make sure that the American people's interests are being
represented," said Dan Grazier of the Project on Government Oversight,
which endorsed a September proposal from McGovern and Rep. Ted Lieu
(D-Calif.) that would recreate the Senate procedure in the House. Such a
bill has almost no chance of becoming law under Trump and the
GOP-controlled Senate, but it signaled a desire among Democrats that
party leaders can act on by enshrining, in their rules for the new House
session, the right of any member to demand a floor debate on an arms
deal. Opposition to arms sales is generally seen as a human rights
issue, but Grazier pointed to another concern he wants to see raised if
there are more debates over such deals: the waivers often involved that
effectively mean the trade is subsidized by U.S. taxpayers. The
development and production of American weapons technology by huge firms
like Lockheed Martin and Boeing involves massive support paid for by the
U.S. government in the form of testing and research assistance. That's
seen as justified since the government is ultimately the top customer
for those companies. Foreign buyers, however, are legally mandated to
pay those costs back ― unless the State and Defense departments agree to
provide waivers for those costs by saying that forcing a payment would
threaten foreign alliances or the specific deal. Over the last five
years, such waivers have cost the U.S. close to \$16 billion, according
to the Government Accountability Office, while private companies and
other governments have been able to protect their bottom lines. More
discussion of the arms trade could also involve more honest
conversations about whether it really creates jobs the way Trump says.
Experts like William Hartung of the Center for International Policy are
doubtful, citing the requirements in many deals to produce in foreign
countries and the likelihood that workers in the industry could be more
productive in other fields. And without the risk of
**[bills]{.underline}** questioning arms sales **[getting trapped in the
foreign affairs committee]{.underline}**, where members **[are
particularly susceptible to administration arguments about diplomatic
caution and especially deluged with foreign lobbying]{.underline}**,
activists believe they would gain an advantage. Proponents of the change
know it is no panacea, and indeed not even a certainty. Democratic
leaders could still turn against it for any number of reasons. The aide
mentioned that some veteran lawmakers are wary of allowing any member of
the 435-person House to take the step, worried that it could disrupt
order when other urgent issues need to be tackled. **[Defense lobbyists
and those working for other governments are also likely to fight the
potential change tooth and nail]{.underline}**, focusing on blocking the
proposal from becoming reality and working with allies in the Pentagon
and the White House. They likely see an opportunity in the fact that
some of the most high-profile new Democratic lawmakers who have gained
respect for having flipped seats have backgrounds in national security
and may be especially willing to talk about maintaining U.S. dominance
in the international weapons business.

#### USMCA key to American agriculture

**Chrisp 19** (Lynn - President of National Corn Growers Association,
3-15-2019, "Farmers need USMCA to preserve and build upon a successful
trading relationship,"
https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/434239-farmers-need-usmca-to-preserve-and-build-upon-a-successful)

**[America's corn farmers are bracing for another year of
uncertainty.]{.underline}** **[Farmers]{.underline}** in the South have
already started planting, while others **[are anxiously awaiting a
spring thaw to get into the field.]{.underline}** **[They're making
decisions that will create a]{.underline}** **[ripple effect for their
families, communities and the U.S. economy amid depressed farm incomes
and market instability. Reaffirming U.S. trading relationships with our
North American partners is an important step toward stabilizing a
struggling farm economy and the No. 1 legislative priority for corn
farmers this year.]{.underline}** This is why corn farmers from across
the country are taking to Capitol Hill this week. They're laying the
groundwork for a concerted effort by U.S. agriculture producers to
ratify the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA). **[USMCA will
solidify a \$3.2 billion export market for corn farmers and provide some
certainty as farmers begin the hard work of planting and harvesting
their crop.]{.underline}** **[Ratifying USMCA will also instill
confidence in other nations with whom we want to enter into future trade
agreements. Opening new markets will ensure U.S. agriculture remains
competitive for generations to come.]{.underline}** The existing North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has been an unequivocal success
for American agriculture. Over the past 20 years, U.S. agricultural
exports to Canada have tripled and quintupled to Mexico. Exports of feed
grains in all forms, which includes corn, sorghum, and barley, increased
an astounding 329 percent since NAFTA went into effect in 1994.
President Trump followed through on his campaign promise to renegotiate
the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), announcing the
renamed USMCA with leaders from Mexico and Canada this past November.
Now, farmers are taking an active role to get it across the finish line.
Cementing these markets and reaffirming our trading relationships with
our North American partners is why leaders of commodity organizations
representing corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum stood together before
more than 9,000 attendees at last month's Commodity Classic and pledged
to work together to see USMCA ratified this year. For corn farmers,
**[USMCA preserves and builds upon our successful trading relationship
with Mexico and Canada. USMCA maintains zero tariffs on U.S. corn and
corn products while also setting a high standard for future trade
agreements in areas critical to U.S. agriculture such as biotechnology
and the creation of a rapid-response mechanism to address trade
challenges.]{.underline}** But it's not just farmers who benefit from
North American trade. **[In 2014, 17.3 million American jobs were
related to agriculture, more than 9 percent of total U.S. employment.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that NAFTA supports 14 million
U.S. jobs.]{.underline}** We can't afford to lose this market. **[The
president has threatened to withdraw from NAFTA if Congress does not
approve USMCA. We take this threat seriously and recognize that without
USMCA, American agriculture and rural communities would be
devastated.]{.underline}** **[A Purdue University and Farm Foundation
study found that this action would amount to a \$9.4 billion loss in
agricultural exports annually.]{.underline}**

#### Extinction 

**Castellaw 17** (John -- 36-year veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and
the Founder and CEO of Farmspace Systems LLC, "Opinion: Food Security
Strategy Is Essential to Our National Security," 5/1/17,
https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/9203-opinion-food-security-strategy-is-essential-to-our-national-security)

**[The United States faces many threats to our National Security. These
threats include continuing wars with extremist elements such as ISIS and
potential wars with rogue state]{.underline}** North Korea **[or
regional nuclear power Iran.]{.underline}** **[The heated economic and
diplomatic competition with Russia and a surging China could spiral out
of control.]{.underline}** Concurrently, we face threats to our future
security posed by growing civil strife, famine, and refugee and
migration challenges which create incubators for extremist and
anti-American government factions. Our response cannot be one
dimensional but instead must be a nuanced and comprehensive National
Security Strategy combining all elements of National Power including a
Food Security Strategy. **[An American Food Security Strategy is an
imperative factor in reducing the multiple threats impacting our
National wellbeing.]{.underline}** **[Recent history has shown that
reliable food supplies and stable prices produce more stable and secure
countries. Conversely, food insecurity, particularly in poorer
countries, can lead to instability, unrest, and violence. Food
insecurity drives mass migration around the world from the Middle East,
to Africa, to Southeast Asia, destabilizing neighboring populations,
generating conflicts, and threatening our own security by disrupting our
economic, military, and diplomatic relationships.]{.underline}** **[Food
system shocks from extreme food-price volatility can be correlated with
protests and riots.]{.underline}** Food price related protests toppled
governments in Haiti and Madagascar in 2007 and 2008. In 2010 and in
2011, food prices and grievances related to food policy were one of the
major drivers of the Arab Spring uprisings. Repeatedly, history has
taught us that a strong agricultural sector is an unquestionable
requirement for inclusive and sustainable growth, broad-based
development progress, and long-term stability. The impact can be
remarkable and far reaching. **[Rising income, in addition to reducing
the opportunities for an upsurge in extremism, leads to changes in diet,
producing demand for more diverse and nutritious foods provided, in many
cases, from American farmers and ranchers.]{.underline}** **[Emerging
markets currently purchase 20 percent of U.S. agriculture exports and
that figure is expected to grow as populations boom.]{.underline}**
Moving early to ensure stability in strategically significant regions
requires long term planning and a disciplined, thoughtful strategy. To
combat current threats and work to prevent future ones, our national
leadership must employ the entire spectrum of our power including
diplomatic, economic, and cultural elements. The best means to prevent
future chaos and the resulting instability is positive engagement
addressing the causes of instability before it occurs. This is not
rocket science. We know where the instability is most likely to occur.
The world population will grow by 2.5 billion people by 2050.
Unfortunately, this massive population boom is projected to occur
primarily in the most fragile and food insecure countries. This alarming
math is not just about total numbers. Projections show that the greatest
increase is in the age groups most vulnerable to extremism. There are
currently 200 million people in Africa between the ages of 15 and 24,
with that number expected to double in the next 30 years. Already, 60%
of the unemployed in Africa are young people. Too often **[these
situations deteriorate into shooting wars]{.underline}** requiring the
deployment of our military forces. We should be continually mindful that
the price we pay for committing military forces is measured in our most
precious national resource, the blood of those who serve. For those who
live in rural America, this has a disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of
those who serve in our military come from the farms, ranches, and
non-urban communities that make up only 16% of our population. Actions
taken now to increase agricultural sector jobs can provide economic
opportunity and stability for those unemployed youths while helping to
feed people. A recent report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs
identifies agriculture development as the core essential for providing
greater food security, economic growth, and population well-being.
**[Our active support for food security, including agriculture
development, has helped stabilize key regions over the past 60 years. A
robust food security strategy, as a part of our overall security
strategy, can mitigate the growth of terrorism, build important
relationships, and support continued American economic and agricultural
prosperity while materially contributing to our Nation's and the world's
security.]{.underline}**

## Uniqueness

### Will Pass -- Cooperation

#### Bipartisan support means USMCA passage likely

**Leonard, 6/13**/2019 (Jenny, associate editor with Inside U.S. Trade
and World Trade Online, "Pelosi Names Democrats to Lead USMCA Talks as
Trump Urges Speed," Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-13/pelosi-names-democrats-to-lead-usmca-talks-as-trump-urges-speed)

House Speaker Nancy **[Pelosi designated members of her caucus to
negotiate with the White House]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}**
changes to President Donald **[Trump's new North American trade
deal]{.underline}**, **[signaling momentum towards]{.underline}**
**[a]{.underline}**n eventual floor **[vote,]{.underline}** according to
two people familiar with the matter. Massachusetts Democrat Richard
Neal, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, will lead the group that
will negotiate directly with U.S. Trade Representative Robert
Lighthizer. The members will focus on four areas, including
Representative Earl Blumenauer, the Oregon Democratic chair of the Trade
Subcommittee, who will cover drug-pricing provisions with Illinois
Democrat Janice Schakowsky. Negotiating labor measures will fall to Mike
Thompson and Jimmy Gomez, both of California. Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon
and John Larson of Connecticut will deal with the environmental chapter.
Strengthening the enforcement of all these provisions will be handled by
Terri Sewell of Alabama and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut. A Democratic
aide with direct knowledge of the plan confirmed the names. Democrats
have made passage of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement contingent on
certain changes to these provisions, and they have laid out fixes that
could satisfy their demands. Democratic staffers have privately blamed
the Trump administration for not engaging with their proposed solutions.
Administration officials say the Democrats' demands aren't specific
enough. A bipartisan staff delegation went to Mexico City this month for
a fact-finding mission to assess the implementation of Mexico's recently
passed labor reform bill. Read More: House Democrats Say They're
Optimistic About Approving the USMCA **[Trump on Thursday said the deal
is "coming along well"]{.underline}** and that he hopes it gets approved
quickly. "Everybody wants it. It's in Congress right now. It's in the
House. And they're reviewing it. **[I think that'll be a very bipartisan
bill," Trump said. "Everybody wants it and hopefully they can act
quickly]{.underline}**. If we can get support from, really the Democrats
in Congress. Nancy Pelosi. They have to put the bill forward." Canadian
Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Thursday the country is
moving ahead with ratification of the USMCA at a pace that will be "in
tandem" with the U.S. ratification. She said Canada is taking a
"Goldilocks approach' to approving the deal: not too fast and not too
slow. Freeland declined to comment on whether Canada will be able to
ratify before parliament breaks for summer, likely this month. Senate
Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley has often cited Canada's political
calendar to warn that time is running out for the U.S. Congress to
approve the pact. U.S. lawmakers in the House and Senate have been vocal
about the need to pass the deal before they leave for August recess.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Thursday said he thinks
the economic bump from passing the USMCA is being underappreciated, and
signaled optimism it will be ratified. "We're waiting to see if it can
get through Congress," **[Kudlow said]{.underline}** at the Peterson
Institute for International Economics in Washington. "**[Speaker Pelosi
has been very accommodative thus far.]{.underline}** **[I'm
optimistic]{.underline}** about that."

### Will Pass -- Momentum

#### USMCA will pass now -- Trump push and bipartisan support

**Cassella and Restuccia, 5/30**/2019 (Megan, trade reporter for
POLITICO Pro, Andrew, White House reporter at POLITICO, "Trump
administration makes major push for Congress to pass new NAFTA,"
Politico,
https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/30/trump-administration-nafta-congress-1348431)

**[The Trump administration has taken a step toward ratification of the
new]{.underline}** North American **[trade agreement, sending a draft
statement to Congress]{.underline}** that puts the legislative body on
notice the pact could be coming soon. **[The decision]{.underline}** to
send the draft of what's called the \"Statement of Administrative
Action\" on Thursday afternoon **[is creating fresh tension
with]{.underline}** House Speaker Nancy **[Pelosi]{.underline}** and
other Democrats **[who]{.underline}** **[are still
pressing]{.underline}** the administration **[to address problems that
they]{.underline}** have raised **[with the
U.S.-M]{.underline}**exico-**[C]{.underline}**anada
**[A]{.underline}**greement. The step comes after U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Lighthizer and other Trump **[administration
officials emphasized that they would not send the USMCA to Congress
without a signal from Pelosi that]{.underline}** she and **[her caucus
were ready to hold a vote on it.]{.underline}** **[The
move]{.underline}** begins a 30-day window that must pass before the
Trump administration is allowed to submit the full implementing
legislation to Congress. It does not start a clock on any legislation to
be taken up, but it **[paves the way for the next step in the
process]{.underline}** --- **[sending the USMCA to Capitol Hill for a
vote --- to take place as soon as the end of next month.]{.underline}**
But Democrats are continuing to press for changes in areas such as labor
standards and enforcement. Pelosi has also indicated that she wants to
see how Mexico implements its new labor laws before USMCA gets a vote in
Congress. The House speaker derided the decision to send the draft
statement before Democrats were fully satisfied as \"not a positive
step.\" \"It indicates a lack of knowledge on the part of the
administration on the policy and process to pass a trade agreement,\"
she said in a lengthy statement. "A new trade agreement without
enforcement is not progress for the American worker, just a press
release for the president." House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal
(D-Mass.) also said that the timeline for considering the deal will
depend on when changes are made to address Democrats\' issues with the
agreement. **[The \"premature submission\" of the draft statement will
have \"no impact\" on continuing discussions, Neal added.]{.underline}**
A Capitol Hill aide added that the draft statement was unlikely to bring
the Trump administration \"any closer to addressing concerns that
members of Congress have voiced." "I think they're trying to create the
illusion of progress by checking a box,\" the aide said. Administration
officials, for their part, sought to emphasize that the decision to move
forward with the statement of administrative action was foremost a
procedural step. **[In a letter]{.underline}** sent to key congressional
leaders including Pelosi, **[Lighthizer said]{.underline}** **[the draft
statement \"provides an outline for further discussions with
Congress]{.underline}** on these issues." **[\"We believe that the
USMCA]{.underline}** can --- and ultimately **[will]{.underline}** ---
**[attract broad bipartisan support]{.underline}** in both Houses of
Congress,\" **[Lighthizer wrote.]{.underline}** \"That certainly remains
my goal.\" **[The timing of the move leaves open the
possibility]{.underline}** **[of]{.underline}** the Trump administration
**[seeing the deal passed this summer]{.underline}**, depending on
whether and when officials are able to reach a compromise with
Democrats. Vice President Mike Pence told reporters earlier Thursday
during a trip to Ottawa that **[the administration is \"working
earnestly\" to wrap the process up before the fall]{.underline}**. \"I
can assure you that the president and I are working with members of the
United States Congress to pass the USMCA --- and to pass the USMCA this
summer,\" Pence said during a news conference after a meeting with
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. **[The White House\'s move also
backs up actions that its North American trading partners have taken
this week to move the deal toward approval in their respective
countries]{.underline}**. Mexico took the first steps to ratify the new
North American pact in its Senate on Thursday, while Canada introduced a
bill earlier this week to implement the deal.

#### Momentum for the deal to pass soon

"Sunday Morning Futures," **[adding that he believes the deal will
pass.]{.underline}** **[The]{.underline}** future of the **[trade
pact]{.underline}**, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, **[was put
in jeopardy]{.underline}** this month **[due to]{.underline}** President
**[Trump's]{.underline}** **[threat of imposing tariffs on imported
Mexican goods]{.underline}** in an effort to get the country to control
the flow of migrants into the U.S. **[However, the president ultimately
suspended implementation of the tariffs after he said Mexico agreed to
"take strong measures to stem the tide of migration"]{.underline}** to
the border with the U.S. "I am pleased to inform you that The United

### Will Pass -- Negotiations

#### Negotiations are underway and make passage likely

working groups get to it," Politico,
https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2019/06/14/usmca-working-groups-get-to-it-447295)

**[USMCA WORKING GROUPS GET TO IT]{.underline}**: House Democrats' Trade
Working Group features nine members tasked with resolving Democratic
demands to overhaul certain parts of the new NAFTA deal. House Speaker
Nancy **[Pelosi named lawmakers to the group this week, setting in
motion a process for negotiating with the Trump
administration]{.underline}**. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard
Neal will lead the group. Who's on: The group is divided into four
subgroups: drug pricing, labor, environment and enforcement. Reps. Earl
Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) will lead the drug
pricing team. Reps. Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.)
will head up the labor group. Reps. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.) and John
Larson (D-Conn.) will tackle environmental issues. Reps. Terri Sewell
(D-Ala.) and Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) will work on enforcement. **[White
House is hopeful]{.underline}**: White House chief economic adviser
Larry **[Kudlow said he met recently with]{.underline}** President
Donald **[Trump and]{.underline}** U.S. Trade Representative Robert
**[Lighthizer and indicated the administration is still deferring to
Pelosi]{.underline}** on timing for bringing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement to the floor. Republicans are pressing for a vote on the deal
before the August recess or shortly after lawmakers return from the

the trade deal soon it will become too controversial to be approved once

The **[Mexican Senate is poised to pass]{.underline}** a package of
**[legislative reforms meant to fulfill its requirements under the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement]{.underline}** on trade negotiated by
President Trump. It remains unclear if those reforms will satisfy
Democratic lawmakers who have called for far-reaching changes before
they will set a House vote to approve Trump\'s deal. **[The upper
house]{.underline}** of the Mexican legislature, known as the Chamber of
Deputies,
**[[received](https://twitter.com/senadomexicano/status/1120388578150842369)
the reform legislation from its lower house]{.underline}** on **[Monday,
setting up a vote as early as this week]{.underline}**. Key Mexican
leaders argued **[the reforms would satisfy its obligations under the
USMCA]{.underline}**. Leftist president **[Andrés Manuel López Obrador
has endorsed the USMCA and the reform package]{.underline}**. That
boosts the odds that the **[legislation will be approved before the
April 30 deadline]{.underline}**, when the current Mexican legislative
session ends. Obrador and his allies are pushing to fast-track the
reforms, noted Juan Carlos Hidalgo, Latin American policy analyst for
the nonprofit Cato Institute. \"AMLO wants to move on from his end of
the deal regarding USMCA and focus on his domestic agenda. On that, he
enjoys the support of most of the Mexican establishment,\" Hidalgo said.
\"However, it remains to be seen if Democrats will be satisfied with the
reform.\" Napoleón Gómez Urrutia, president of the Senate committee that
has jurisdiction over labor issues, [praised the reform
package](https://politico.mx/minuta-politica/minuta-politica-congreso/senado-recibe-dictamen-de-reforma-laboral/)
Monday, according to the news site Político Mexico. Urrutia is the
president of the Mexican Union of Miners and Metalworkers and an ally of
Obrador. The reform package guarantees workers secret ballots in
leadership elections and in approving union contracts. Critics argue the
current system in Mexico allow businesses to corrupt the elections and
install labor leaders beholden to the company, not the workers. \"I
believe that this is a reform that will allow us to achieve and
consolidate freedom, transparency and the possibility that workers can
effectively elect their leaders and choose the union they wish to belong
or stop belonging to, and to review collective bargaining contracts,\"
Urrutia [said
Monday](https://politico.mx/minuta-politica/minuta-politica-congreso/senado-recibe-dictamen-de-reforma-laboral/).
However, last week Urrutia told El Financiero that [additional
reforms](https://elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/secretaria-del-trabajo-otorga-toma-de-nota-a-confederacion-de-napoleon-gomez-urrutia)
would be needed to end management\'s influence over the arbitration
boards that monitor the elections, indicating that the legislation was
not as far-reaching as it could be. **[Democrats]{.underline}** from
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on down, **[have
said]{.underline}** that the **[USMCA cannot pass until Mexico adopts
comprehensive labor reforms]{.underline}**. Earlier this month, [84
Democratic
lawmakers](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/democrats-sought-to-deny-us-workers-secret-ballot-they-now-demand-for-mexican-unions)
sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, warning
that "previous versions of the (Mexican reform) bill failed to ensure"
worker rights and reiterated that they would oppose the USMCA unless
more far-reaching changes are passed.

at a Washington, D.C., event hosted by the Canadian American Business

Mexico\'s legislature, she said. Barcena also said **[Mexico \"was not

negotiations]{.underline}**. Democrats, again including Pelosi, have
called for the talks to be reopened. Congressional Democrats are

### Generic

#### Ending arms sales sparks massive debate 

**Mahanty and Eikenberry, 2018** (Daniel R, director of the U.S. program
at the Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC). Prior to joining CIVIC,
Dan spent 16 years at the U.S. Department of State; Eric, director of
policy & advocacy at the Yemen Peace Project; "How the "Arms Sales
Oversight Act" Could Prevent American Arms from Contributing to the Next
Overseas Crisis," Just Security, December 5,
https://www.justsecurity.org/61719/arms-sales-oversight-act-prevent-american-arms-contributing-overseas-crisis/)

**[The debate over U.S. complicity in Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe
is coming to a head in the Senate,]{.underline}** with a series of votes
on the Sanders-Lee-Murphy war powers resolution. **[But beyond
this]{.underline}** immediate measure, **[other members of Congress are
planning to increase their long-term leverage over weapons
sales]{.underline}** to problematic security partners. Foremost among
them, Representatives Ted **[Lieu]{.underline}** (D-Calif.) and Jim
McGovern (D-Mass.) recently **[introduced]{.underline}** House
Resolution 7080, **[the "Arms Sale Oversight Act]{.underline}**," to
little fanfare. The bill's unassuming title and procedural focus should
not escape the attention of conventional arms control advocates. If
passed, H.R. 7080 would expand Congress's constricted ability to vote
down damaging arms sales and mark a first step toward preventing the
United States from exacerbating the human cost of conflict. The
legislation would reform Section 36 of the Arms Export Control Act
(AECA) to ensure that any supportive representative can move to
discharge a joint resolution of disapproval against a proposed arms sale
ten days following its introduction if the presiding committee fails to
report it. Win the vote in the House, pass the same joint resolution in
the Senate (or vice versa), and Congress has successfully exercised its
primary legal means of immediately barring a harmful transfer (whether
or not the White House agrees). The measure could dramatically reshape
congressional authorities over arms exports. Currently, due to a
separate AECA provision, only senators are guaranteed a vote on a joint
resolution of disapproval. Absent H.R. 7080's proposed reform,
corresponding House resolutions will remain "highly privileged"---which
means that those seeking to stop a transfer at present can only secure a
vote only if leadership acquiesces. This inter-chamber imbalance not
only robs representatives of a vote in determining U.S. foreign policy,
but also diminishes the efforts of conventional arms control advocates
in the Senate. Because joint legislation from the House is unlikely to
see the floor, Senate efforts can be reduced to signaling opposition to,
rather than truly shutting down, an administration's proposed sale. By
correcting this imbalance, H.R. 7080 will open another avenue to ending
U.S. enabling of other governments' gross violations of international
humanitarian and human rights laws. Nowhere is this avenue more needed
than for Yemen's internationalized civil war. There, parties to the
conflict routinely conduct indiscriminate attacks on civilians and have
created a humanitarian crisis that has pushed millions to the brink of
starvation. Yet, it is Saudi Arabia and the UAE, using U.S.-manufactured
weapons and logistical support, that have caused the majority of the
conflict's recorded civilian casualties. Causing further concern, a new
documentary aired by Deutsche Welle, presents credible evidence that the
coalition states have diverted U.S.-manufactured armored vehicles to
unaccountable non-state militias. **[Admittedly, the Senate has rarely
made a serious attempt to block an arms sale by resolution of
disapproval, but support for exercising greater Congressional oversight
over arms sales seems to be on the rise.]{.underline}** And even when a
resolution of disapproval fails to pass, mere consideration of the
legislation can send clear signals to the executive branch and recipient
countries alike, and can stimulate valuable policy debate. While S.J.
Res. 39, a 2016 effort to block tank sales to Saudi Arabia, mustered 27
votes, S.J. Res. 42, a June 2017 measure to freeze a sale of
precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia, garnered 47. The
administration has not moved forward with a further sale of as many as
120,000 precision munitions to both Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to
Senate opposition; the weapons' traceable serial numbers, as damning as
"made in the USA" stickers, could embroil the United States in further
strikes on buses, hospitals, and homes. While the threat of unicameral
opposition has worked for now, the reforms advanced by H.R. 7080 would
further increase the chances for debate on arms sales in the Congress,
and create a more efficient path for the House and Senate to
indefinitely arrest a sale. Had the procedures outlined in H.R. 7080
been in place in June 2017, H.J. Res. 102 (the House companion to S.J.
Res. 42), could have forced a vote on a motion to discharge instead of
dying quietly in committee, creating a debate that, as it did on the
Senate side, swayed moderate offices against the sale and focused a news
cycle on U.S. complicity in Saudi-led coalition attacks on civilians.
While the most recent and egregious example, Yemen is not the only case
where enhanced Congressional oversight is necessary to add reasonable
constraints to the arms sales process. **[By some credible estimates,
the United States sells arms, including bombs and missiles, to at least
62 countries that are an active party to a conflict.]{.underline}** Some
countries to whom the United States sells arms, such as Bahrain and
Egypt, have demonstrated a consistent pattern of human rights
violations; others present a very clear risk of misuse or diversion, or
even the potential for mass atrocities. And some countries with lower
levels of capacity simply require a greater degree of due diligence to
ensure equipment can be used appropriately. If H.R. 7080 makes it more
likely that Congress could exercise more meaningful oversight in even a
handful of these cases, the risk of U.S. complicity in human rights
abuses or the next humanitarian disaster, wherever it is, could be
meaningfully diminished -- and at minimal opportunity cost.

### Arms Sales

#### The plan sparks a massive backlash -- the GOP and Trump would fight ending arms sales

**Oswald, 2019** (Rachel, Congressional Quarterly\'s foreign policy
reporter, "Senate rejects Paul bid to block arms sales to Bahrain,
Qatar," Roll Call, June 13,
https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/senate-rejects-paul-bid-block-arms-sales-bahrain-qatar)

**[The Senate]{.underline}** on Thursday **[rejected a bid
by]{.underline}** Sen. Rand **[Paul to block arms sales]{.underline}**
to Qatar and Bahrain **[even as senators brace for a more contentious
debate]{.underline}** next week **[over]{.underline}** proposed
**[weapons exports to]{.underline}** **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**
**[and the U]{.underline}**nited **[A]{.underline}**rab
**[E]{.underline}**mirates. The vote Thursday means the proposed sales
--- a \$3 billion Apache Helicopter package for Qatar and a \$750
million munitions package to support Bahrain's F-16 fleet --- can go
forward. **[Senators voted 43-56 against the motion]{.underline}** to
discharge the disapproval resolution for the Bahrain sale from the
Foreign Relations Committee and 42-57 against the motion to discharge
the disapproval resolution for the Qatar sale. **[Paul]{.underline}**, a
foreign policy isolationist, **[argued it was unwise to permit further
weapons exports to the Middle East]{.underline}** at a time of rising
regional instability between Iran and Saudi Arabia as well as continued
threats from regional terrorist groups. Paul used most of his floor time
to castigate Saudi Arabia's foreign policy. He sought to connect
lawmakers' deep frustrations with Riyadh to the weapon sales to Bahrain
--- a tiny Gulf nation that is a close ally of Riyadh --- and Qatar ---
a political rival of Saudi Arabia. "The Middle East is a hot cauldron
continuing and continually threatening to boil over. I think it's a
mistake to funnel arms into these century-old conflicts," the Kentucky
Republican said. "Indirectly, today's vote is about the wisdom of
proliferating arms in the Middle East." Foreign Relations ranking member
Robert Menendez, D-N.J., who is leading Senate opposition to the Trump
administration's decision to skirt congressional review of a separate
\$8.1 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Jordan, said he supported Paul's discharge motion because he wanted to
underline the principle of congressional oversight even as he supports
the proposed weapons exports to Bahrain and Qatar. **[Paul is one of
four Senate Republicans backing Menendez's initiative]{.underline}**. "I
do support the senator from Kentucky's right to seek full consideration
of them by the Senate," Menendez said in floor remarks. "Given the
administration's decision last month to completely flout congressional
review over arm sales, I'm supporting this motion in order to once again
emphasize the importance of congressional oversight and due diligence."
**[Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch urged his colleagues to avoid
conflating their frustration with Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** and the
Trump administration's steadfast loyalty to the kingdom **[with the
matter of the arms sales]{.underline}** to Bahrain and Qatar. "**[These
sales, the two regarding Bahrain and Qatar, address the legitimate
security interests of both countries and strengthen U.S. partnership
with both countries," the Idaho Republican said from the
floor]{.underline}**. "The news this morning of attacks on two more
civilian oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman lends further weight that our
allies and partners in the region need greater capabilities . . . for
their defense." **[The White House has threatened to veto both of the
disapproval resolutions. Menendez]{.underline}** **[said]{.underline}**
he was heartened by the depth of Senate feeling over the
administration's handling of the Saudi Arabia issue, adding
"**[I]{.underline}** certainly **[look forward to a more robust debate
and vote on those sales next week."]{.underline}**

### Defense Contractors

#### Plan costs political capital -- contractors hold undue influence

**Smithberger, 2018** (Mandy, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR DEFENSE
INFORMATION AT POGO, "Brass Parachutes: The Problem of the Pentagon
Revolving Door," Project on Government Oversight (non-partisan gov't
watchdog group), November 5,
https://www.pogo.org/report/2018/11/brass-parachutes/)

In some instances laws designed to punish influence-peddling work.
**[One of the most egregious revolving door examples
involved]{.underline}** the Principal Deputy Under Secretary of the Air
Force Darleen Druyun, who oversaw the management of **[the Air Force\'s
weapons acquisition program]{.underline}** from 1993 to 2002.23 Druyun
helped Boeing win billions of dollars in business while simultaneously
negotiating jobs at Boeing for her son-in-law, and eventually herself.
In 2004, Druyun pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge and was sentenced
to nine months in prison.24 **[The Congressional Budget Office found
that an aerial refueling aircraft deal Druyun was negotiating with
Boeing while seeking employment with the company]{.underline}** would
have overcharged taxpayers nearly \$5.7 billion.25 In that case, the
system ultimately worked, as existing laws did prohibit Druyun's
egregious behavior. However, that was an unusual case. **[A study
commissioned by the Department's acquisition office identified an
additional eight acquisition actions involving Druyun "where the
acquisition process appeared irregular or abnormal and where the results
may not have been in the best interest of the
Government."]{.underline}** The study specifically questioned
justifications for sole-source decisions, contract adjustments made
after initial award, and changes resulting in "less stringent
requirements for the contractor, but higher costs for the Government."26
**[The revolving door is just one of several forms of undue influence on
the operations of the Department of Defense]{.underline}**. While beyond
the scope of this report, the reverse-revolving door (when defense
industry officials join the government, raising concerns they will then
give preferential treatment to their former employers) is also a matter
of significant concern. **[Top contractors have been over-represented in
Department leadership]{.underline}**. At the beginning of his
Administration, President **[Obama issued an ethics executive order
banning lobbyists form working in agencies they lobbied during the
previous two years, only to issue the first waiver shortly
thereafter]{.underline}** to his first Deputy Secretary of Defense,
William Lynn, who was previously a Raytheon lobbyist.27 The last Deputy
Secretary for that Administration, Bob Work, joined Raytheon's board
shortly after he retired from the government.28 President Donald Trump's
Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, was a former board member of General
Dynamics. His Deputy Secretary, Patrick Shanahan, came from Boeing, the
Pentagon's second largest contractor. **[Campaign contributions,
lobbyists, earmarks, industry-sponsored trips, and contracts structured
to garner political support for specific contractors' programs also
undermine the fairness and effectiveness of the procurement
system]{.underline}**. The government and the public have significantly
more---though still inadequate---information about those other forms of
influence-peddling. For example, campaign contributions must be
periodically disclosed, registered lobbyists must report their
expenditures and generic lobbying activities, and incoming executive
branch officials have to disclose their positions held outside of
government. But **[the public has significantly less information when it
comes to the activities of former government officials]{.underline}**.

### Saudi Arabia

**[The Senate]{.underline}** on Tuesday **[narrowly rejected an effort

Joe **[Manchin]{.underline}** (W.Va.) **[and]{.underline}** Mark
**[Warner]{.underline}** (Va.) **[voted against moving the
measure]{.underline}**. **[The motion faced an uphill climb in the
Senate]{.underline}**, **[despite growing concerns about
Saudi]{.underline}** **[Arabia]{.underline}**'s involvement in Yemen\'s
civil war. **[Top Republicans]{.underline}**, including Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), **[signaled]{.underline}** ahead of the vote
**[that they were opposed to the motion]{.underline}**, **[arguing that
reneging on the arms agreement would undercut a key U.S.
ally.]{.underline}** "As we know, some have raised the issue of Saudi
conduct of that war \[in Yemen\], but blocking this arms sale will
diminish Saudi capability to target with precision. \... Part of the
training provided to Saudi Arabia will be on subjects such as avoiding
civilian casualties," McConnell said. He added that Saudi Arabia is
involved in "two important struggles": fighting the Islamic State in
Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and countering Iran's influence in the Middle
East. Blocking the deal, McConnell said, would send the wrong signal.
Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.), the chairmen of
the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, respectively, also
opposed blocking the deal, saying they had urged Saudi Arabia to improve
its ability to avoid civilian casualties with its airstrikes. **[\"It\'s
hard for me to understand why people would oppose the selling of
precision guided missiles,\" Corker told reporters]{.underline}**,
stressing they help lower unintended casualties. McCain said blocking
the deal would be "crazy." "I\'ve been putting pressure on them for
years and years and years, and they have made some improvements. \...
They've got a long way to go," he told reporters in a recent interview.

Sales in the Middle East: Trends and Analytical Perspectives for U.S.
Policy," Congressional Research Service, October 11,
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44984.pdf)

**[Saudi Arabia has been one of the largest purchasers of U.S.
arms]{.underline}** by value and volume, though **[decades of U.S.-Saudi
weapons transactions have]{.underline}** at times **[been accompanied by
public controversy and vigorous congressional debate]{.underline}**. The
Obama and Trump Administrations have notified Congress of proposed arms
sales with a potential aggregate value of more than \$120 billion from
2009 to the present, reflecting the putative importance of Saudi Arabia
to U.S. strategy in the Middle East. President Trump announced several
proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia during his first foreign trip in
office in May 2017 (see textbox). The technologically-advanced and often
historic amounts of arms transfers both reflect and reinforce U.S.-Saudi
ties. However, **[the relationship has been challenged by differences
over the Iran nuclear agreement]{.underline}** (which Saudi Arabia
initially opposed but now supports), **[historic Saudi animosity to
Israel]{.underline}**, **[continued U.S. concerns regarding Saudi
domestic governance and actions with regard to international terrorism,
and the kingdom's regional activities]{.underline}** (**[such as the war
in Yemen]{.underline}**).

### A2 Winners Win

#### Winning doesn't produce more wins -- empirics and studies

**Edwards 2013** -- University Distinguished Professor of Political
Science and the Jordan Chair in Presidential Studies at Texas A&M
University (George C, Overreach: Leadership in the Obama Presidency,
Book Review, <http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9690.html>, CR)

When Barack Obama became president, many Americans embraced him as a
transformational leader who would fundamentally change the politics and
policy of the country. Yet, **[two years into his
administration]{.underline}**, the public resisted his calls for support
and **[Congress was deadlocked over many of his major policy
proposals.]{.underline}** How could this capable new president have
difficulty attaining his goals? Did he lack tactical skills? In
Overreach, respected presidential scholar George Edwards argues that
**[the problem was strategic]{.underline}**, not tactical. He finds that
in President Obama\'s first two years in office, **[Obama governed on
the premise that he could create opportunities for change by
persuading]{.underline}** the public and some **[congressional
Republicans to support his major initiatives.]{.underline}** As a
result, **[he proposed a large, expensive, and polarizing
agenda]{.underline}** in the middle of a severe economic crisis. The
president\'s proposals alienated many Americans and led to a severe
electoral defeat for the Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections,
undermining his ability to govern in the remainder of his term. Edwards
shows that **[the president\'s frustrations were]{.underline}**
predictable and **[the inevitable result of misunderstanding the nature
of presidential power]{.underline}**. The author demonstrates that
**[the essence of successful presidential leadership is recognizing and
exploiting existing opportunities, not in creating them through
persuasion]{.underline}**. When Obama succeeded in passing important
policies, it was by mobilizing Democrats who were already predisposed to
back him. Thus, **[to]{.underline}** **[avoid overreaching, presidents
should be alert to the limitations of their power to persuade and
rigorously assess the possibilities for obtaining]{.underline}** public
and **[congressional support in their environments]{.underline}**.

### A2 No Spillover

#### Issues spillover to impact the broader agenda

**Haftel '11** (Yoram Z, Assist Prof, PhD @ Ohio State, "Delayed
Ratification: The Domestic Fate of Bilateral Investment Treaties",

Of course, leaders face many political obstacles that are not captured
in the formal process of treaty ratification, and it is important to
consider such constraints in addition to the specific hurdles governing
treaty ratification. As one U.S. BIT negotiator explained, it is not
just the ratification institutions that Washington takes into account in
a partner, "it's how freely the government functions."34 Like
[legislation and]{.underline} other [policy initiatives]{.underline},
treaty ratification [is subject to **issue-linkage** at the domestic
level and often requires **the expenditure of finite political
capital**]{.underline}, [thus the executive must take into account
**these broader political dynamics**]{.underline} when advocating for a
treaty. [For example]{.underline}, President [Obama's efforts to
secure]{.underline} Senate ratification of the new [START]{.underline}
treaty with Russia [were held up]{.underline} by Republicans [in
Congress **as part of a broad political strategy, not for reasons
related to**]{.underline} proliferation or **[national
security.]{.underline}** Partly for these reasons, and because
executives may depend on legislatures and local governments to implement
a treaty's provisions, the preferences of other domestic actors matter
even when they do not play a formal role in ratification. In Canada, for
example, the prime minister often seeks to "build a broad base of
support for international treaties"35---even though no such legal
requirement exists.

#### Vote switching will happen on unrelated legislation

**Simes '10** -- \*publisher of the National Interest, Executive
Director of The Nixon Center and Associate Publisher of The National
Interest, served in the State Department from 2003 to 2005 \[12/23,

Victory?",
http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/start-pyrrhic-victory-4626, CR\]

Had the lame-duck session not already been so contentious, this need not
have been a particular problem. [Several]{.underline} Senate
[Republicans indicated openness to supporting the treaty earlier in the
session]{.underline}, including Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator John
McCain. Senator Jon Kyl---seen by many as leading Republican opposition
to the agreement---was actually quite careful to avoid saying that he
opposed New START until almost immediately prior to the vote. [Our own
conversations with]{.underline} [Republican]{.underline} Senate
[sources]{.underline} during the lame duck session [suggested that
several additional Republicans could have voted]{.underline} to ratify
New START [under other circumstances]{.underline}; Senator Lamar
Alexander is quoted in the press as saying that [Republican anger over
**unrelated legislation** cost five to ten votes]{.underline}. By the
time the Senate reached New START, earlier conduct by Senate Democrats
and [the White House had **alienated** many Republicans who could have
voted for the treaty. That the administration]{.underline} secured
thirteen Republican votes (including some from retiring Senators) for
the treaty now---and [had many more potentially within its grasp---makes
clear what many had believed all along: it **would not have been so
difficult** for]{.underline} President [Obama to win the fourteen
Republican votes needed for ratification i]{.underline}n the new Senate,
[if he had been prepared to wait and to **work more
cooperatively**]{.underline} with Senate Republicans. Senator Kerry's
comment that "70 votes is yesterday's 95" ignores the reality that he
and the White House could have secured many more than 70 votes had they
handled the process differently and attempts to shift the blame for the
low vote count onto Republicans.

### Agriculture I/L Exts

#### Key to solve tariffs and exports 

Michael **Dykes 2019**. President and CEO of the International Dairy
Foods Association., 4-19-2019, \"Opinion: Let\'s end the uncertainty:
Congress has what it needs to pass the USMCA,\" Agri-Pulse,

**[The]{.underline}** U.S. **[International Trade
Commission]{.underline}** (ITC) **[released their]{.underline}**
much-anticipated **[analysis of]{.underline}** U.S.-Mexico-Canada
Agreement (**[USMCA]{.underline}**) yesterday, **[and]{.underline}** the
**[upshot for]{.underline}** U.S. **[food and agriculture
was]{.underline}** a **[clear]{.underline}** win. **[In a time of
uncertainty]{.underline}** on the trade front, **[with tariffs prompting
retaliatory tariffs]{.underline}** from Mexico to China as the
Administration maneuvers through its trade agenda, **[the ITC
offered]{.underline}** some **[sweet solace]{.underline}**. More than
anything, the report proved us all right in the food and ag space---we
said **[USMCA would boost U.S. food and agricultural
exports]{.underline}**, and ITC confirmed that fact. And for the dairy
industry, perhaps more clearly than any other segment of food and
agriculture, the ITC report is indisputable---it's a boon. The
economists at ITC determined that the USMCA \"would likely have a
positive impact on all broad industry sectors within the U.S. economy\"
and that the U.S. agricultural and food exports will increase by \$2.2
billion. ITC expects exports of U.S. dairy products to increase by more
than \$277 million overall---\$227.0 million to Canada and \$50.6
million to Mexico, respectively. **[Mexico is our number one
market]{.underline}** for all U.S. dairy products. Last year we shipped
\$1.4 billion of products from cheese to whey to ice cream to skim milk
powder and everything in between. And **[Canada is right there in second
place]{.underline}**, buying more than \$639 million of U.S. dairy
products in 2018. In this context, passage and **[ratification of USMCA
should]{.underline}** happen yesterday **[not only]{.underline}** to
**[bring relief to the]{.underline}** U.S. food and **[agriculture
industry, but]{.underline}** to **[ensure long-term
growth]{.underline}** for our businesses and producers who need free and
fair trade to fuel their progress. Overall, **[USMCA includes important
improvements that]{.underline}** will **[enable]{.underline}** food and
**[agriculture to trade]{.underline}** more fairly **[and]{.underline}**
to **[expand exports]{.underline}** of U.S. dairy products to our North
American partners. During negotiations, I worked alongside the
Administration on behalf of our dairy member companies to maintain dairy
market access in Mexico, eliminate Canada's trade-distortive Class 7
pricing program, improve market access into Canada, ensure strong
provisions on sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and equally strong
provisions on geographical indications. Now, the report is no surprise
to those on the Hill who required it with their authority through Trade
Promotion Authority. Most have admitted publicly and privately that
**[USMCA offers an improvement over]{.underline}** the former North
American Free Trade Agreement, or **[NAFTA]{.underline}**, for most
sectors of the U.S. economy. Again, **[the ITC report offered an
unbiased assessment]{.underline}**, estimating that USMCA would raise
U.S. GDP by \$68.2 billion, generating a higher growth rate than other
free trade agreements in effect, and create about 176,000 new American
jobs.

#### Solves certainty and retaliatory tariffs 

Bill **Tomson**., 4-18-**2019**, \"USMCA analysis shows \'slight\' gains
for US ag exports,\" Agri-Pulse,
https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/12119-usmca-analysis-shows-slight-gains-for-us-ag-exports,
accessed 4-23-2019//JDi

The **[U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement would be an overall win for
the]{.underline}** U.S. **[farm sector, reforming biotechnology and
phytosanitary standards]{.underline}**, but it would also allow for only
"slight increases" in exports of some U.S. agricultural commodities,
according to a [379-page
analysis](https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4889.pdf) released
today by the U.S. International Trade Commission. **[U.S.]{.underline}**
dairy, poultry and egg **[producers]{.underline}** would **[get a direct
bump in exports]{.underline}** to Canada **[from USMCA
provisions]{.underline}**, but Canadian dairy, sugar and
sugar-containing products also would benefit from increased access to
U.S. importers. In **[an ITC simulation considering only]{.underline}**
the **[market access provisions]{.underline}** in the agreement, **[ag
exports increased \$435 million]{.underline}** and imports saw an \$80
million hike. **[Considering]{.underline}** the agreement\'s **[overall
language]{.underline}** --- including provisions impacting things like
intellectual property rights, labor, and investment provisions --- **[ag
exports jumped \$2.2 billion annually]{.underline}**, a 1.1 percent
increase. One of the biggest beneficiaries would be U.S. dairy. Canada
agreed to increases for U.S. access to its tightly controlled domestic
market through [new tariff rate
quotas](https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/fact-sheets/2018/october/united-states%E2%80%93mexico%E2%80%93canada-trade-fact)
for milk, cheese, cream, skim milk powder, butter, ice cream, whey and
other dairy products. Canada also pledged to eliminate its Class 7 dairy
pricing system, which U.S. producers say flooded the international
market with skim milk powder. The International Dairy Foods Association
highlighted the estimated \$227 million in additional exports to Canada
as a result of UMCA. "We believe the USMCA is a big win for the U.S.
dairy industry and this report confirms that fact," said IDFA President
and CEO Michael Dykes. "The next step is for Congress to swiftly take up
the agreement and vote to pass the USMCA." It's not fair to judge USMCA
strictly on increased exports, according to organizations like the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and the National Corn Growers Association. That's
because the pact is essentially a continuation of the North American
Free Trade Agreement that reduced most agriculture tariffs to zero more
than two decades ago. "The **[USMCA makes critical updates to rules on
intellectual property]{.underline}**, currency practices, **[digital
trade, customs]{.underline}**, state-owned enterprises, sanitary and
phytosanitary measures **[and technical barriers to trade that will be
valuable to]{.underline}** many **[American farmers]{.underline}**
**[and businesses]{.underline}**, even though their impact on GDP has
historically been inherently difficult for economists to measure,\" said
NCGA President Lynn Chrisp. The bottom line is that **[USMCA is needed
to keep]{.underline}** the **[tariffs at zero and keep exports
flowing]{.underline}** to Mexico and Canada, two of the largest and most
dependable foreign markets, according to the umbrella group Farmers for
Free Trade. "**[The true benefit]{.underline}** that **[USMCA
delivers]{.underline}** for American farmers **[is certainty and
stability]{.underline}**," said Brian Kuehl, one of the group's
executive directors. "Especially right now, **[American farmers need a
victory. USMCA will guarantee]{.underline}** that **[their most
important export markets remain open]{.underline}** for business **[and
free from red tape]{.underline}**," Perhaps one of **[the most
important]{.underline}** reasons **[farmers are hoping USMCA will be
implemented is]{.underline}** the fact **[that]{.underline}** President
Donald **[Trump continues to threaten to pull the U.S. out of NAFTA,
even if the replacement isn't in place]{.underline}**. **[Trump
campaigned on pulling out of NAFTA]{.underline}**, an act that could
result in Mexico and Canada resurrecting pre-NAFTA tariffs on U.S.
commodities.

#### Deal solves ag\-\--provides certainty and expands markets 

Zippy **Duvall 2019**. President of the American Farm Bureau
Federation., 4-3-2019, \"U.S. Ag Gets A Great Deal With USMCA,\"
American Farm Bureau Federation,
https://www.fb.org/viewpoints/u.s.-ag-gets-a-great-deal-with-usmca,
accessed 4-23-2019//JDi

Farmers know a good deal when we see one. We watch every penny and
stretch every dollar as far as it can go. We fix up our tractors and
repair our old pickup trucks year after year, hoping to get yet another
season out of them. At the same time, we always have our eye on the
latest technology and tools that will make our farms and ranches more
productive and more efficient. I don't know a farmer or rancher who
would pass up a good deal that could make their business better. The
same is true when it comes to trade deals. When **[NAFTA
was]{.underline}** signed more than 25 years ago, it **[was the best
trade deal U.S. agriculture had ever seen]{.underline}**. But now
**[the]{.underline}**re's a **[new deal]{.underline}** on
**[offer]{.underline}**---the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement or USMCA. We
have **[a chance to trade in a great agreement for an even better
one]{.underline}**. Since NAFTA went into effect in 1994, U.S. ag
exports to Canada and Mexico have more than quadrupled, making these our
number 1 and number 2 markets respectively. In 2018 alone, we exported
\$20.7 billion in ag products to Canada and \$19 billion to Mexico.
These **[markets have]{.underline}** only **[grown in value for U.S.
farmers]{.underline}** and ranchers. Over the last decade, **[ag exports
have increased 27 percent to Canada and 23 percent to
Mexico]{.underline}**. But as good as NAFTA has been, **[it's time for
an upgrade]{.underline}**: it's time for Congress to approve USMCA.
**[Without USMCA]{.underline}**, our most **[critical markets hang in
the balance]{.underline}**. Both **[Canada and Mexico]{.underline}**
have already **[signed another deal that does not include the United
States]{.underline}**. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for
Trans-Pacific Partnership replaces the TPP agreement that the U.S.
agreed to but then backed out of in 2017. The CPTPP gives Canada and
Mexico preferential trade terms with nine other countries and gives
those countries better access to Canada's and Mexico's markets―all while
the ongoing trade war hangs overhead, with tariffs hurting U.S.
agricultural exports. Just this week, Japan is following through on its
promises under the CPTPP and reducing its tariffs and raising its quotas
for ag products from CPTPP partners. This is all the more reason why we
must bring the USMCA across the finish line and secure our valuable
trade partnership with our nearest neighbors. The **[USMCA
is]{.underline}** also **[important in setting the stage for other
modern trade agreements for U.S. agriculture]{.underline}**. NAFTA
needed to be modernized, and the **[USMCA has bells and
whistles]{.underline}** that **[we don't have under our existing trade
agreements]{.underline}**. Let's look under the hood. For the U.S., it's
the first trade agreement to deal with approval of and trade in products
of biotechnology. This groundwork will be critical in agreements we
pursue with other countries, especially in the EU, the UK and Japan. The
new agreement broadens access for U.S. dairy and finally brings an end
to Canada's unfair class 7 pricing scheme. These are wins we didn't see
even under TPP. Finally, USMCA will bring greater access for poultry,
improve wheat grading standards, and make much-needed improvements to
animal and plant health protection standards. Finally, **[ratifying the
USMCA will show]{.underline}** our **[top trading
partners]{.underline}** and other countries that **[the United
States]{.underline}** and the trade negotiators who represent us **[mean
business]{.underline}**. **[It would prove]{.underline}** that **[our
word and handshake can be trusted when we strike a deal]{.underline}**.
Right now, it's important for each of us to call on our lawmakers in
Washington and tell them how important the USMCA is to agriculture.
Farmers and ranchers are resilient, but our businesses---not to mention
the jobs and rural communities that depend on us---cannot survive
without our top markets. Let's get this deal done, so we can move
forward with opening and expanding more markets around the globe.

#### It's critical to maintain US ag exports\-\--key to global ag security

**Duvall 19** (Duvall is American Farm Bureau president. "Congress
should ratify USMCA trade deal now" February 22, 2019
https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/431237-congress-should-ratify-usmca-trade-deal-now)

When it comes to trade, America's farmers and ranchers know a good deal
when they see one. **[After private and public analysis, it is clear
that the]{.underline}** recently negotiated
**[U.S.-M]{.underline}**exico-**[C]{.underline}**anada
**[A]{.underline}**greement **[is good news at a time when we need it
most.]{.underline}** **[Not only does USMCA help lock in the quadrupling
of U.S. ag]{.underline}**ricultural **[exports]{.underline}** to our
neighbors accomplished over the last 25 years, **[but it also includes
reform of a number of trade rules and is projected to further increase
our exports to two of our most important markets. In this time of
economic challenge for agriculture, it is vital that Congress ratify
this trade deal now]{.underline}**. **[The food and farm products grown
by America's farmers]{.underline}** and ranchers **[are among the
world's highest quality and most competitive]{.underline}**.
Traditionally, about 25 percent of all our farm products, by value, are
exported to other nations. While that key measurement speaks volumes
about the demand for U.S. farm products in the international
marketplace, nowhere is our advantage clearer than in our two markets
closest to home. USMCA will not only help secure the gains U.S.
agriculture made under the previous North American Free Trade Agreement,
but according to a study last month by Purdue University, USMCA could
also increase U.S. net exports to Canada and Mexico by another \$454
million. Demand is more important than ever because on the supply side
**[America's farmers and ranchers are farming more efficiently across
the board]{.underline}**. For example, the Agriculture Department just
reported that while farmers harvested fewer acres of soybeans this past
year, they produced a record 4.54 billion bushels due to higher yields.
**[In order to move that supply, USMCA builds demand through trade with
our neighbors]{.underline}**. Reaching that point was tough and there
were, and continue to be, some bumps in the road, such as our tariffs on
steel and aluminum imports that have led to retaliatory tariffs against
our ag exports. But overall, U.S. trade negotiators -- and likewise
their counterparts from Mexico and Canada \-- should be commended for
striking this deal that gets a whole lot right by looking at the bigger
picture. When it comes to agriculture, our negotiators definitely put
their best foot forward. USMCA builds new market access for dairy and
poultry products and maintains the zero-tariff platform on all other ag
products. For U.S. dairy farmers, USMCA eliminates aspects of Canada's
dairy program (Classes 6 and 7) that had been used to undercut U.S.
sales of dried milk products. Under the agreement, U.S. dairy products
gain access to an additional 3.6 percent of Canada's dairy market.
Access for U.S.-grown food also increases due to USMCA's inclusion of
important provisions surrounding geographic indication standards in
Mexico. That will help ensure that U.S. products, such as mozzarella,
cheddar and provolone cheese, among others, do not face restrictions due
to the mere use of common names. In addition, both Canada and Mexico
adopted guidelines that make it more difficult to register any new
geographic indicators that generally would be considered common food
names. For the first time, **[USMCA also includes measures that address
cooperation, information sharing and other trade rules among the three
nations related to agricultural biotechnology and gene
editing]{.underline}**. **[That should help prevent trade barriers based
on how plants are bred, and that could help set a standard when the
issue comes up with other nations,]{.underline}** such as China. Also
included are technical provisions to reduce other trade-distorting
policies, increase transparency and help ensure non-discriminatory
treatment of ag products among the three nations. For example, Canada
has agreed to grade imports of U.S. wheat in a manner no less favorable
than their own. And Mexico and the United States agreed that all grading
standards for ag products will be non-discriminatory. For ag products,
there are also provisions that enhance science-based standards for
sanitary and phytosanitary measures, which in the past have been used as
non-tariff trade barriers. Overall, this was a hard-fought win and we
commend the administration for this effort to solidify the trading
relationships we have with our North American neighbors. U.S. farmers
and ranchers have worked hard to build markets and be reliable suppliers
to both countries. Now **[it's up to Congress to seal the deal by
ratifying USMCA in a timely manner]{.underline}**. America's farmers and
ranchers depend on good relationships with our two closest trading
partners, and they are depending on Congress to ratify USMCA.

#### Facilitates ag innovation and ag trade

**Purdue 18 (**Sonny, former governor of Georgia + current US Secretary
of Ag, 10-21-2018, \"Column: USMCA a trade deal for the 21st century,\"
http://www.capitalpress.com/Opinion/Columns/20181021/column-usmca-a-trade-deal-for-the-21st-century)

With the announcement of a new trade pact among the United States,
Mexico and Canada, we welcomed the tremendous news that the North
American Free Trade Agreement (**[NAFTA) will be, if approved by
Congress, replaced by a much stronger agreement]{.underline}**. Known as
the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (**[USMCA)]{.underline}**, the
package **[will be important for American workers and our economy as a
whole]{.underline}**, **[including the agricultural
sector]{.underline}**, which counts Mexico and Canada in our top three
trading partners. I have long said that I believe our country is located
in the best neighborhood on Earth --- North America --- with valuable
allies to our north and south. **[Though]{.underline}** the old
**[NAFTA]{.underline}** agreement **[was considered a generally positive
compact for agriculture, there was certainly room for much-needed
improvement]{.underline}**. **[Under USMCA, we have created new rules to
help our farmers, ranchers and workers better face the challenges of the
21st century economy,]{.underline}** **[which will secure greater
access]{.underline}** to the Mexican and Canadian markets and maintain
**[and improve the highly productive integrated agricultural
relationships we have as nations]{.underline}**. The agreement with
Mexico came first, near the end of August, and includes a number of
provisions sought by the United States. Importantly, **[21st century
innovations in agricultural biotechnology are addressed for the first
time]{.underline}**, including cutting-edge processes like gene editing.
**[These innovations serve as a template for agreements in the
future]{.underline}**. And we mutually pledge to work together to reduce
trade-distorting policies, increase transparency and ensure
nondiscriminatory treatment in grading of agricultural products. In
addition, the United States and Mexico agreed not to use so-called
"geographic indicators" to restrict the marketing of certain cheeses
under common names, such as provolone, Swiss, or ricotta, which the
European Union had wanted to restrict. The second piece of the USMCA
puzzle was the negotiation with Canada, where key sticking points
centered on dairy issues and were among the last to be cleared. Notably,
as one of the president's top goals, the new agreement will eliminate
Canada's unfair "Class 6" and "Class 7" milk pricing schemes, in which
Canada has used low-priced products to undercut United States dairy
sales in Canada and other international markets. **[The deal will also
crack open additional access to United States dairy into
Canada]{.underline}**, including products like fluid milk, cream,
butter, skim milk and cheese, **[and will also preserve and expand
critical access for United States poultry and egg producers. America's
wheat farmers also get a big win. A reform of Canada's discriminatory
wheat grading process will help United States wheat growers along the
border become more competitive]{.underline}**. **[These are all
significant victories for American agriculture]{.underline}**. As we
celebrate this breakthrough, it is worth noting that there were many
detractors who said it could not be done. But the emergence of an
agreement is further proof that President Trump's trade negotiation
strategy is working. To strike the best deals possible for the United
States, the president has shown that he is willing to walk away from the
bargaining table if he feels our country is being unfairly treated. In
the case of USMCA, the president's approach resulted in earnest
negotiations among the three nations and a final package which is
beneficial for all three countries. This is not the first major step
forward in international trade under the Trump administration, nor do we
feel it will be the last. Before President Trump successfully concluded
USCMA, he made good on his promise to revise and improve KORUS, the
trade pact with the Republic of Korea. Add to these achievements the
president's recent announcement of his intention to negotiate a trade
deal with Japan --- a significant market for United States agriculture
exports that, until recently, had rejected talks of a bilateral
agreement with the United States --- and growing optimism for a
successful trade deal with the European Union, and it is easy to see the
dominoes falling. The president is committed to achieving good trade
deals for America --- including our current issues with China, which I
believe we will surmount as well. The bottom line is this: **[Free, fair
and expanded trade among nations is good for the American economy and
our highly productive farmers, ranchers, foresters and
producer]{.underline}**s. The newly minted **[USMCA goes in the win
column]{.underline}** for President Trump and his negotiating team, led
by our United States Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert Lighthizer.
**[Our economy, and American agriculture, will be better off for
it.]{.underline}**

**[There is a long history of sudden increases in food
insecurity]{.underline}** contributing to, or **[directly producing,
violent protests]{.underline}** and riots as individuals take to the
streets in response to shortages, **[dating back]{.underline}** at leas
t **[from the famous bread shortage that ignited the French
Revolution]{.underline}** (for a series of examples in different
contexts and periods, see also Brinkman & Hendrix, 2011: 7--8).7 Indeed,
during **[a series of violent riots in Somalia]{.underline}** in 2008
**[prompted by rising food prices, one]{.underline}** participant
**[summarized their motivation]{.underline}** for taking to the streets
b**[y saying: 'I've never demonstrated before, but I'm not ashamed
because if you can't eat, you will do whatever you can]{.underline}** \[
\... \]'.8 Thus, our theoretical focus is on the generation of **[food
insecurity]{.underline}** and how it **[translates into violent
unrest]{.underline}**. As such, our primary theoretical interest is with
food consumers. Domestic production **[shortfalls and higher food prices
translate into food insecurity in two ways]{.underline}**. **[First,
food shortages decrease food availability]{.underline}**, thus
**[imperiling the basic ability of individuals to
survive]{.underline}**. **[Second, food shortages highlight food
entitlements]{.underline}**, which Sen (1981: 459) defines as 'the
ability of different sections of the populations to establish command
over food using the entitlement relations in that society'. In other
words, **[an increase in food insecurity both challenges the ability of
people to procure food and emphasizes the existing differences in
society]{.underline}** between those that can and those that cannot do
so. When confronting a situation of food scarcity, **[individuals become
more willing to participate in violent demonstrations and
riots]{.underline}**, for several reasons. First, **[shocks to food
security act as a source of grievance by denying individuals access to
basic necessities]{.underline}**. Thus, **[scarcity can generate
competition and animosity]{.underline}** between societal groups and
between societal groups and the state over issues of food availability.
Second, **[these shocks]{.underline}** can also **[increase existing
grievances]{.underline}**, by emphasizing food entitlements. In this
sense, **[abrupt increases in food insecurity will highlight existing
inequalities and conflicts]{.underline}** between different societal
groups (e.g. occupational and ethnic differences). Finally, the
**[desperation that food insecurity entails reduces the perceived costs
associated with violence]{.underline}** (see also Brinkman & Hendrix,
2011). **[Participating in violent demonstrations, while costly, may be
a preferable alternative to not demonstrating and]{.underline}**
potentially **[being unable to feed oneself or family]{.underline}**.
The effect of food insecurity is shaped by the degree to which each
country is vulnerable to food insecurity. While these threats exacerbate
grievances and inflame existing social hierarchies by both reducing food
availability and highlighting food entitlements, as well as reducing the
relative costs of participating in violent demonstrations, the
vulnerability of the state to food insecurity plays a crucial role in
moderating food insecurity's impact on the likelihood of violence. State
vulnerability alters the calculations of individuals contemplating
participation in violent demonstrations. **[When states are especially
vulnerable, the ramifications of abrupt increases in food insecurity are
likely to be more widespread, and grievances are more likely to trigger
violence precisely because the state lacks the economic and
institutional resilience necessary to address the grievances of its
population and deter violence]{.underline}**. Threats to food security
**[Sudden increases in the threat of food insecurity -- abrupt and
dramatic reductions in the ability of individuals to access food -- are
a multi-faceted outcome and may result from]{.underline}** either
domestic or **[international processes]{.underline}**. To understand
when and why food insecurity triggers violence, it is essential to
theorize individually its different sources, which we consider in turn
below. **[International food prices]{.underline}** can **[affect the
threat of food insecurity in two ways]{.underline}**. **[First, the
absolute level of international food prices impacts the price that local
customers must pay for food]{.underline}**. **[Higher food prices
increase the risk of food insecurity because, ceteris paribus, higher
prices make it more difficult for consumers to purchase
food]{.underline}**. **[Second, sudden increases in the price of food
might also heighten the threat of food insecurity, by dramatically and
unexpectedly reducing the ability of consumers to procure
food]{.underline}**, thus **[triggering shortages that are difficult for
consumers to anticipate and plan for]{.underline}**.

High food prices exacerbate food insecurity, leading to political
instability **[Recent events demonstrate how high the stakes
remain]{.underline}**. Following a 20-year period of relative stability
in world food markets, extreme price volatility marked the 2000s,
particularly the period from 2007 to the present (see Figure 1, "Food
prices and food-related protests, 1990--2015"). **[From 2007 to 2011,
high food prices swelled the ranks of the world's food
insecure]{.underline}**, with women and children most acutely affected.
Since then, **[the number of food-insecure people has trended
downward]{.underline}**---**[thanks]{.underline}** in large part **[to
lower prices and increased ag]{.underline}**riculture
**[investment]{.underline}** by governments, the private sector, and
nonprofits. **[However, we can ill afford to be
complacent]{.underline}** about prospects going forward, **[as food
insecurity is expected to deepen in key regions]{.underline}** if the
current trajectory holds. **[The social and economic costs of these food
price spikes were considerable, however the political fallout---as well
as the relationship between food and political stability it
highlights---was just as damaging]{.underline}**. **[Food price--related
protests]{.underline}**, also in Figure 1, **[toppled
governments]{.underline}** in Haiti and Madagascar in 2007--08. \[Begin
Box 2\] Hunger is not a necessary precondition for instability
**[Countries affected]{.underline}** by food price--related riots **[are
not just those with poor governance or where hunger]{.underline}** and
food insecurity **[are prevalent]{.underline}**. **[According to the
widely followed Fragile States Index, Egypt, Libya, and Syria were at
less risk prior to the 2010--11 food price spike than countries like
Colombia and Nigeria---and yet all three were
destabilized.]{.underline}**8 [**That high food and fuel prices were
the** **catalyst for destabilizing riots** **in regimes thought to be
relatively safe implies that our** **risk-assessment tools
underestimated the potential for food price--related
instability**]{.underline}. \[End Box 2\] And [**in 2010--11, food
prices and food insecurity were again implicated in the political
turmoil and** **mass uprisings of the Arab Spring**]{.underline}. These
movements did not all begin violently, but **[once protesters were
mobilized, heavy-handed government responses often led otherwise
peaceful protests to become violent and destabilizing]{.underline}**.
**[In both periods, countries of high strategic significance to the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[were
affected]{.underline}** (see Figure 2, "Food riots 2007--11 and current
oil exports"). **[The unrest in the Middle East and North Africa roiled
energy markets: more than 20 percent of world crude and petroleum
exports pass through either the Suez Canal or the Strait of Hormuz, and
both were ringed by countries experiencing
unrest]{.underline}**.9**[¶]{.underline}** Though oil flows through
those channels were not disrupted, **[unrest in Libya and concern that
the Arab Spring would spread]{.underline}** to major Gulf oil exporters
(Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) **[pushed already
high oil prices up]{.underline}** by 15 percent in late February and
early March 2011.10 [**The resulting instability** **strained Egyptian
relations with Israel and necessitated a NATO intervention in
Libya**]{.underline}. **[The ongoing civil war in Syria---which can be
linked to drought, food insecurity, rapid urbanization, and exclusionary
rule]{.underline}** (see Box 1, "Important terms")---[**is exacting a
massive toll and contributing to** **growing tensions with Russia,
dissention over refugee resettlement among NATO partners in Europe, and
the escalation of a serious threat**]{.underline} to the Iraqi
government. Closer to US borders, soaring prices for staples like rice
and beans in Haiti led to a week of rioting in 2008 during which five
people were killed, with the violence involving both Haitian police and
UN Peacekeepers. Moreover, **[rising food prices and deteriorating
economic prospects there fueled attempts to immigrate to the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. **[As food prices shot
up]{.underline}** almost 20 percent **[in 2007, US Coast Guard
interdictions of Haitians rose 34 percent, straining US Coast Guard
resources]{.underline}**.11**[¶]{.underline}** Thus the **[food riots of
2007--11 offer very clear examples of how food insecurity and grievances
over high prices abroad affect US national security at home and stress
national security resources.]{.underline}**

**[In 2010, over 250,000 Syrian farmers were forced from their land due
to water shortages. Lack of water left these]{.underline}** farmers
**[dangerously food insecure, so they moved,]{.underline}** en masse,
**[into Syrian urban centers. This strained an already overburdened
infrastructure]{.underline}** **[which increased tensions]{.underline}**
between urban dwellers and the displaced farmers (El Hassan, 2014).
**[One year later, the Syrian Civil War began, which has killed over
500,000 Syrians and has destabilized the entire country]{.underline}**.
Since then, **[the Islamic State has conquered swaths of land through
terror campaigns]{.underline}**, **[rebel and Syrian military clashes
have left thousands dead, while bombing campaigns]{.underline}** by
American, Russian, French, and Turkish air forces **[have reduced cities
to rubble]{.underline}**. **[The conflict began as a civil war but has
evolved to threaten the interests of major world powers]{.underline}**.
While **[limited access to food and water]{.underline}** did not
directly spark the violence in Syria, it **[was the underlying cause of
the instability]{.underline}** seen in that region today. **[Concerns
about access to food can be applied to many of the world\'s developing
countries]{.underline}**. **[Developing countries
g]{.underline}**enerally **[have large agricultural
sectors]{.underline}** **[but]{.underline}** may lack **[the
infrastructure or government]{.underline}** institutions to **[supply
all of its citizens with adequate food]{.underline}**. **[When people
are hungry,]{.underline}** **[they]{.underline}** often
**[fight]{.underline}** their government, or they break into ethnic or
religious factions and fight each other. **[Such

**[and]{.underline}** even, **[as Syria has proven]{.underline}**,
**[entire regions]{.underline}**. **[Regional
destabilization]{.underline}** in **[the developing
world,]{.underline}** in turn, **[threatens the peace and security of
the international community]{.underline}**. Rich countries such as the
United States and Western Europe, must support developing countries
through aid and trade policies so that food insecure countries do not
become fragile or failed states. Causes of Food Insecurity **[Many
developing nations experience food]{.underline}** and water
**[insecurity]{.underline}** on a higher scale than developed nations
**[because of]{.underline}** irresponsible or malicious government
policies, the effects of climate change, and **[rising food
prices]{.underline}**. The war in Afghanistan has left many rural
Afghans without access to food because of increases in staple food
prices. Using a multivariate framework, D'Souza and Jolliffe (2013)
found that **[provinces experiencing declines in food security have been
active hotspots for violence]{.underline}**. The pains of **[food
shortages have been felt in Afghanistan]{.underline}** long before the
American invasion in 2001, however. **[During the 1990s, civil conflict
made it extremely difficult to grow and distribute enough food to feed
everyone]{.underline}**. Adequate supply and distribution of food may be
more important than food production itself because **[it]{.underline}**
actually **[became a military strategy to starve off certain armed
groups]{.underline}** and civilian supporters (Clarke, 2000). More
commonly, the flow of staple food was inadequately disrupted as a result
of the conflict. Fighting closed roads and increased the cost of
transportation, making it extremely difficult to reach rural areas.
Similar problems affected Syrian farmers in 2010. Destruction of roads
and shutdowns cut off transportation of food in or out of the cities,
which starved rural civilians. Their desperation helped bolster Islamic
State ranks because joining the group provided a better promise of food
(El Hassan, 2014). The displaced farmers in the cities found themselves
relying on locally produced food to survive rather than their own
harvests. This is a massive problem that follows food insecurity in
rural areas. Insecurity leads to urbanization, thus forcing more
citizens to rely on other farmers or the government to feed them. Such
conditions strain already weak government institutions and can lead to
internal conflict (Byrd, 2003). Sudan dealt with urbanization very
poorly in the early 2000s which helped continue the Second Sudanese
Civil War. Sudan faced particularly brutal circumstances in the 21st
century because of late rains, disruptions in trade,1 high levels of
displacement, and higher food prices (Moszynski, 2009). The Janjaweed,
who controlled the government, refused to provide certain areas with
sufficient food, which increased violent responses from the Sudanese
People\'s Liberation Army (Moszynski, 2009). Higher food prices and
potential effects of climate change also played roles in the Sudanese
crisis. It was not just a lack of rain and high food prices that starved
Syria, Sudan, and Afghanistan, it was their government's inability to
remedy these problems in the first place. Poor Institutional Capacity
Although the developed world experiences food insecurity, it is the lack
of infrastructure and government institutions in developing countries
that contribute to civil wars and state fragility. Foreign exchange
shortages can provoke food and fuel scarcities that force governments to
spend less on essential services and public goods. Accordingly, citizens
see their medical and educational entitlements melt away. Such
circumstances create breeding grounds for internal conflict. All violent
conflicts destroy land, water, and social resources for food production.
Developing countries do not have massive industrial machines that can
remedy such losses, therefore, the population will suffer. Food
insecurity is a recruitment tool for violent extremist groups. Promising
food and water to a starving population, especially in urban areas,
makes recruiting young and disgruntled youth easier (Messer & Cohen,
2015). Syria had limited institutional capacity to deal with the mass
displacement, and that lead to a civilian revolt and recruitment into
the Islamic State. Countries that fail to provide their people with
basic services often experience gross economic inequality, and even
human-rights violations, as was the case in both Syria and Sudan. Both
countries are classified as Least Developed Countries (LDCs). LDCs are
distinguished not just by their widespread poverty, but also by their
structural weaknesses in economic, institutional, and human resources
that make them unable to maintain stability during a drought. The
combination of drought and political instability or violence led to
famine in Somalia (another LDC) in 2011. Even with urgent humanitarian
action, the country still plunged into chaos and violence (Messer &
Cohen, 2015). Severe drought, like Somalia\'s, may result in crop
failure in major food producing areas, which in turn is a significant
threat to social stability and peace (Wischnath, 2014). Sometimes
droughts of exceptional severity (and the civil unrest that follows) are
attributed to climate change, especially in particularly arid regions.
Scholars are divided on whether climate change actually impacts civil
conflict. That is why African countries like Somalia and Sudan are prime
case studies. Africa has the lowest percentage of irrigated land in the
world. Agriculture is the most important sector of most African
countries. Very high percentages of civilians in African countries live
in rural areas. Those characteristics combined with low economic and
state capacity make African, particularly sub-Saharan African countries
the most vulnerable to climate change and civil instability. Africa
experiences more civil conflict than other parts of the world,
therefore, it is possible to argue that a lack of climate variability
effect on civil conflict in Africa would make it unlikely to cause civil
conflict in other parts of the world (Koubi et al., 2012).
Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon attributed the
conflict in Darfur to an ecological crisis arising "at least in part
from climate change" (Ki-moon, 2007). The Fourth Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessed that climate change
will continue to worsen. As it does, it will increase food shortages,
which may lead to conflict (AR4, 2007). The report also stated that
forced displacement and rising social instability is the most likely
result of food insecurity. This is almost exactly what happened in
Syria. The first step towards conflict might be food riots, which often
occur during a food shortage or when there is an unequal distribution of
food. These are usually caused by food price increases, food
speculation, transport problems, or extreme weather. In 1977, Egyptians
became so desperate for food that they attacked shops, markets, and
government buildings just to obtain bread and grain (Paveliuc-Olariu,
2013). Moreover, civil war can create economic opportunities for certain
groups, so they try to avoid resolving the conflict. Urban elites in
Somalia profited tremendously off of internal conflict because of the
absurd amount of foreign aid that was pumped into the country and then
largely stolen (Shortland, Christopoulou, & Makatsoris, 2013). Once a
country experiences a food shortage, it may lead to protests, riots, and
violence. This all contributes to state instability, but it is not the
state alone that suffers. If one country fails, it creates a crisis that
could destabilize an entire region. State Failure and the Threat to
Regional Stability Although fragile governments in developing countries
are at a heightened risk for internal conflict that could topple them,
that risk also threatens the country's neighbors. After the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, Afghanistan found itself alone in regional trade.
Without a guaranteed source of cereal, the government had to turn to
Iran and Pakistan for support in order to avoid its own collapse
(Clarke, 2000). Unlike Afghanistan, many other developing countries have
been unable to work together on food and water security. Thirteen of the
twenty-two members of the Arab League rank among the most water-scarce
nations on the planet. Food cannot be grown without water. The majority
of the world is engaged in some sort of agreement with neighboring
countries to share water supplies, but thirty-seven countries still do
not share their water resources (El Hassan, 2014). Lack of cooperation
can cause civil as well as interstate conflict. South Sudan legally has
no share of the Nile River and the effects of that lack of water access
have been mass starvation and violence. The effects of climate change,
water shortages, and mass migrations have resulted in acute food
insecurity not just in Syria, but across the region (El Hassan, 2014).
**[Food insecurity, plus an increase in the prices of staple
foods]{.underline}** have **[destabilized much of the
area]{.underline}**. The Arab Spring was the beginning of multiple
conflicts that have affected countries like Syria, Egypt, and Libya. In
Syria, food insecurity resulted in mass violence and has now created an
international crisis involving multiple world powers. **[Food insecurity
is such a threat to entire regions because people cannot live without
food and people want to live]{.underline}**. **[When a region
experiences food scarcity and that population feels threatened by
hunger, it will relinquish dependency on any political authority and
take up arms in order to ensure its well-being]{.underline}**
(Paveliuc-Olariu, 2013). **[This is human survivalism]{.underline}**. It
is important for developing countries in areas that are at risk for food
insecurity to formulate policy that ensures aid goes to the food
insecurity hotspots so as to maintain stability. **[South Sudan
experienced what happens]{.underline}** when countries do not work
together to feed their people. After gaining its independence from Sudan
in 2011, 360,000 South Sudanese refugees returned to the country. This
**[influx of]{.underline}** **[human beings]{.underline}**, coupled with
drought conditions **[exacerbated economic strain and drove food prices
up]{.underline}**. The increases were the result of trade restrictions
between Sudan and South Sudan. The overall reason for the food crisis,
however, was the government\'s preoccupation with fighting a political
and quasi-ethnic civil war rather than negotiating fair access to the
Nile River (Tappis et al., 2013). Because of South Sudan's weak
institutions, it has done little to address the food shortage. **[That
inability to solve the problem]{.underline}** **[fuels insurgent
recruitment that continues the bloodshed]{.underline}** in South Sudan.
The conflict is keeping regional rivalries alive with Uganda, Kenya,
Ethiopia, and Sudan; all of whom have attempted to intervene in South
Sudan militarily to bring about stability (Council on Foreign Affairs
2016). Aside from South Sudan, multiple conflicts across Africa are
consuming massive amounts of diplomatic, political, and humanitarian
resources in a region that faces a multitude of threats. South Sudan,
Somalia, and Syria are all failing states that are experiencing huge
food shortages, humanitarian crises, and most importantly, extreme civil
violence. South Sudan is mired in a civil war. Somalia is controlled by
warlords and terror organizations. Syria has both of those problems.
**[Conflict has turned these countries into "breeding grounds of
instability, mass migration, and murder]{.underline}**" **[rather than
sovereign states with a monopoly on violence and control over their
borders]{.underline}** (Rotberg, 2002). To be sure, failing states are a
concern because of their ability to destabilize entire regions, but
states at risk for failure are also very important. **[Countries like
Pakistan]{.underline}** **[that are politically unstable and have food
and water shortages could result in uncontrollable civil
upheaval]{.underline}** (The Fund for Peace, 2016). Global Consequences
of State Failure **[Failing states and destabilized regions
are]{.underline}** not just a problem for the developing world. They are
a **[very real concern for the United States and other developed
countries as well. The Islamic State fed off of the Syrian Civil War
and]{.underline}** **[helped destabilize Iraq, Syria, Libya, and even
Afghanistan and the Philippines. They have]{.underline}** at also
**[inspired terror attacks in Europe and the United
States]{.underline}**. They are a threat to both the developed and
developing world. **[State]{.underline}** **[instability allows them to
recruit and train without government interference,]{.underline}**
**[which]{.underline}** in turn **[allows them to plan attacks outside
the region]{.underline}**. An important source of income for the Islamic
State has been agriculture from Iraq and Syria. While this revenue has
received less media attention than oil extraction, it is still an
important part of their economy (Jaafar & Woertz, 2016). It is also a
key aspect of their political legitimacy because it allows them to feed
their soldiers and those they control. Controlling some of the most
fertile regions of the two countries has also helped the Islamic State
starve off areas that have resisted them (Jaafar & Woertz, 2016). If
Syria or Iraq are ever going to stabilize, those breadbaskets must be
retaken and the food must reach the civilians in the cut off areas. In
the 20th century, state failure had few implications for international
peace and security. **[Thanks to globalization]{.underline}**, that is
no longer the case. **[Failed states pose a threat to]{.underline}**
themselves, their neighbors, and **[the entire international
community]{.underline}** (Rotberg, 2002). Islamic State - inspired
terror attacks in Belgium and France are a direct result of state
collapse in Syria and Iraq. Preventing states from failing, rather than
having to intervene militarily when they do, ought to be a top priority
in the foreign policy of rich nations. Although the situations in Syria,
Somalia, and South Sudan seem beyond repair, nation-building projects
have had success in the past. Tajikistan, Lebanon, Cambodia, Kosovo and
East Timor are all examples of relatively successful attempts to put
failing states back on the right track (Rotberg, 2002). Developed
countries must have the political will to ensure that people in
developing countries are fed so that they remain pacified. It is often
severe food insecurity that precedes ethnic or religious violence, as
has been the case in South Sudan, therefore, adequate food is paramount
to avoiding humanitarian crises that accompany ethnic and sectarian
conflict (The Economist, 2016). While it is true that many developed
countries, especially the United States, are weary of providing so much
financial aid and intervening militarily in war-torn, developing
countries, it is imperative that the rich do not abandon the poor to a
fate of internal destruction. Money must not be thrown blindly towards
humanitarian crises and military intervention must be the last resort.
Developed countries provided \$1.4 billion for humanitarian aid in South
Sudan in its first year of independence, but without specific
conditions, that money went to kleptocrats rather than infrastructure
projects or public services (The Economist, 2016). Paying to help
developing nations is expensive and will continue to be so. Afghanistan
and Iraq are proof of that. But the war on terror, repeated military
intervention, and humanitarian aid are expensive as well. In 2002,
Robert Rotberg suggested that a new Marshall Plan was required for
places like Afghanistan, the DRC, Sierra Leone, Somalia, and Sudan. If
it is true that food and water security are the keys to keeping relative
peace in new and developing countries and their collapse threatens the
safety of the developed world, it seems logical that assisting those
countries is wise. In 1999, Susan L. Woodward argued that military
leaders focus too much on force versus force combat rather than the
issues of insurgency and terrorism in failed states. In 2017, military
leaders have adjusted their strategies accordingly. Woodward believed
that globalization made states less important, but their failure would
still be felt around the world. Failed states cannot exercise their
monopoly on violence and they cannot control their borders, thus
threatening more than just the failed state (Woodward, 1999). Because
state failure is so consequential, the United States military must
continue to look into measures it can take to prevent it. The Threat of
the Future Finally, the threats from food shortages in South Sudan,
Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria are important to the United States
and the international community at large, but there is one country that,
while it is not a failing state right now, could easily become one if
the wealthy nations of the world do not ensure its stability. That
country is Pakistan. The Fund for Peace ranked Pakistan as the 14th most
fragile state in the world in 2016, giving it a "High Alert" designation
for state failure (The Fund for Peace, 2016). Its Demographic Pressure
Indicator was an 8.9 - 10.2 Although it improved by one-tenth of a point
last year, its decade trend is worse by seven-tenths of a point and its
five-year trend is worse by four-tenths of a point, suggesting that the
food situation is actually worsening overall (The Fund for Peace, 2016).
If internal conflict and potential state failure at its most basic level
begins with food and water insecurity, then Pakistan could become a real
problem very soon. Considering the risk of state failure, **[Pakistan
poses the greatest threat to the rest of the world because of the
existence of nuclear weapons within the country]{.underline}**.
**[Pakistan is not a member of the]{.underline}**
**[N]{.underline}**uclear Non-**[P]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty, **[yet it has about 120 nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. It also has a Shaheen 1A ballistic missile that
can reach targets 550 miles away (Pakistan Defence, 2015). **[Should a
food crisis arise in Pakistan that results in civil war
and]{.underline}** governmental **[collapse]{.underline}**, **[those
weapons could end up in the hands of a group that intends to use them
maliciously as an act of terror]{.underline}**. That prospect should be
incentive enough for the developed countries to realize that they cannot
and must not leave food insecure countries to devour themselves. While
it is difficult to argue that food insecurity immediately and directly
causes civil conflict, there is no denying that **[people need food and
water and will fight to survive]{.underline}**. In South Sudan, ethnic
and political armies fight one another. In Syria, rebels and government
forces fight each other while also fighting the Islamic State. And in
Somalia, warlords and their armies fight. The Syrian Civil War began six
years ago after a water shortage forced thousands of migrants into urban
centers. Developing countries tend to be most affected by climate
change, poor governance, and food price increases. Therefore, they are
the most prone to instability that may lead to outright violence.
Without the wherewithal to handle civil conflict, these countries may
become fragile or even failing states. Once that happens, they represent
a threat not just in their region of influence, but the whole world.
That is why the developed Western nations must pay attention and provide
aid to the developing world in order to maintain stability. There will
be more food crises in developing countries in the future, but if the
North has the strength to continue aiding the South, perhaps it will be
able to curb mass starvation and avoid the horrendous violence that
consumes starving countries.

Food security has attracted widespread attention in recent years. Yet,
**[scientists and practitioners have predominately understood food
security in terms of dietary energy availability and nutrient
deficiencies, rather than in terms of food security's consequential
implications for social and political violence]{.underline}.** **[The
present study offers the first global evaluation of the effects of food
insecurity on local conflict dynamics.]{.underline}** **[An economic
approach is adopted to empirically evaluate the degree to which food
insecurity concerns produce an independent effect on armed conflict
using comprehensive geographic data.]{.underline}** Specifically, two
agricultural output measures -- a geographic area's extent of cropland
and a given agricultural location's amount of cropland per capita -- are
used to respectively measure the access to and availability of (i.e.,
the demand and supply of) food in a given region. **[Findings show that
food insecurity measures are robustly associated with the occurrence of
contemporary armed conflict.]{.underline}**

#### Food shortages cause global nuclear conflict

**FDI 12**, Future Directions International, a Research institute
providing strategic analysis of Australia's global interests; citing
Lindsay Falvery, PhD in Agricultural Science and former Professor at the
University of Melbourne's Institute of Land and Environment, "Food and
Water Insecurity: International Conflict Triggers & Potential Conflict
Points,"
http://www.futuredirections.org.au/workshop-papers/537-international-conflict-triggers-and-potential-conflict-points-resulting-from-food-and-water-insecurity.html

**[There is a growing appreciation that]{.underline}** the **[conflicts
in the next century will most likely be fought over a lack of
resources.]{.underline}** Yet, in a sense, **[this is not new.
Researchers point to the French and Russian revolutions
as]{.underline}** conflicts **[induced by a lack of food.]{.underline}**
More recently, **[Germany's World War Two efforts are said to have been
inspired]{.underline}**, at least in part, **[by its perceived need to
gain access to more food.]{.underline}** Yet the general sense among
those that attended FDI's recent workshops, was that **[the scale of the
problem in the future could be significantly greater]{.underline}** as a
result of population pressures, changing weather, urbanisation,
migration, loss of arable land and other farm inputs, and increased
affluence in the developing world. In his book, Small Farmers Secure
Food, **[Lindsay Falvey]{.underline}**, a participant in FDI's March
2012 workshop on the issue of food and conflict, clearly **[expresses
the problem]{.underline}** and why countries across the globe are
starting to take note. .He writes (p.36), "...**[if people are
hungry]{.underline}**, especially in cities, **[the state is not
stable]{.underline}** -- riots, violence, breakdown of law and order and
migration result."¶ "Hunger feeds anarchy."¶ This view is also shared by
**[Julian Cribb]{.underline}**, who in his book, The Coming Famine,
**[writes that if "large regions of the world run short of
food]{.underline}**, land or water in the decades that lie ahead, then
**[wholesale, bloody wars are liable to follow." ¶]{.underline}** He
continues: "**[An increasingly credible scenario for World War 3
is]{.underline}** not so much a confrontation of super powers and their
allies, as **[a festering, self-perpetuating chain of resource
conflicts]{.underline}**." He also says: "The wars of the 21st Century
are less likely to be global conflicts with sharply defined sides and
huge armies, than a scrappy mass of failed states, rebellions, civil
strife, insurgencies, terrorism and genocides, sparked by bloody
competition over dwindling resources."¶ As another workshop participant
put it, people do not go to war to kill; they go to war over resources,
either to protect or to gain the resources for themselves.¶ Another
observed that hunger results in passivity not conflict. Conflict is over
resources, not because people are going hungry.¶ **[A study by
the]{.underline}** International **[P]{.underline}**eace
**[R]{.underline}**esearch **[I]{.underline}**nstitute **[indicates that
where food security is an issue, it is more likely to result in some
form of conflict. Darfur, Rwanda, Eritrea and the Balkans experienced
such wars]{.underline}**. Governments, especially in developed
countries, are increasingly aware of this phenomenon.¶ **[The UK
Ministry of Defence, the CIA, the]{.underline}** US
**[C]{.underline}**enter for **[S]{.underline}**trategic and
**[I]{.underline}**nternational **[S]{.underline}**tudies **[and the
Oslo Peace Research Institute, all identify famine as a potential
trigger for]{.underline}** conflicts and possibly even **[nuclear
war]{.underline}**

#### 2008 proves food insecurity causes unrest\-\--now is uniquely worse as things have spiraled downward over time 

**Martin 17** -- (Erica Martin, New Security Beat, citing a report from
the CSIS. Are We Headed Toward "Recurring Storms" of Global Food
Insecurity? February 27, 2017.
https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2017/02/headed-recurring-storms-global-food-insecurity/)

**[It's often assumed that in the modern era, food security is an
achievable goal]{.underline}**. But **[between 2007 and 2008, a
confluence of conditions shook the international food system to its
core, fueling unrest and riots in more than 40 nations around the
world.]{.underline}** What's more**[, this "perfect storm" may have been
only a harbinger of challenges to come, according to a new report
by]{.underline}** Emmy Simmons of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (**[CSIS]{.underline}**). "**[Recurring storms"
are likely in the coming years due to ongoing instability in many
regions, changing weather patterns, the "double burden" of malnutrition,
youthful demographics, food safety issues, and food price
volatility]{.underline}**, writes Simmons. **[The L'Aquila Initiative, a
short-lived international response to the 2008 crisis, offers lessons
for how to address these underlying trends to improve resilience, but
also revealed how difficult the task is]{.underline}**. "Even when
national leaders are committed to pursuing market-based, inclusive
agricultural growth as a clear pathway to improved food security, and
there is relative peace and stability, **[many risks and uncertainties
-- storm clouds -- loom on the horizon]{.underline}**," writes Simmons.
New and Old Problems **[Many of the factors that played into the 2008
perfect storm are still present]{.underline}**, writes Simmons. The food
crisis stemmed from high food and fuel prices, adverse weather in key
agricultural regions, commodity and financial market turmoil, and
competition from biofuel production. Looking forward, **[adverse weather
and price volatility will continue to threaten food security, especially
in conflict-affected regions,]{.underline}** she says. **[But the years
since 2008 have also produced new challenges]{.underline}**. **[Climate
change]{.underline}** will clearly have a significant impact on
agriculture, writes Simmons. The growing frequency of extreme weather
and natural disasters, like Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and
recurring droughts in Africa, are the biggest risks to food security in
the future, causing volatility in agricultural production. Conflict has
also increased, not decreased, during the last decade. **[An estimated
1.2 to 1.5 billion people live in fragile and conflict-affected states
today. Of the 53 countries facing serious, alarming, or extremely
alarming levels of undernutrition on the 2015 Global Hunger Index, only
three haven't been classified as fragile or
conflict-affected.]{.underline}** ECSP's Roger-Mark De Souza called
climate change a "threat multiplier" at the launch of the report on
February 7 at CSIS. "Climate change drives a set of secondary risks
around violent conflict, political instability, population displacement,
poverty, and hunger," he said. It "exacerbates food insecurity and
triggers conflict in a multitude of ways." When there's competition over
scarce resources and high food prices, it's often marginalized groups
and low-income urban populations who are most affected. **[Johanna
Mendelson Forman, a senior advisor at the Stimson Center and adjunct
professor at American University, said she expects current
conflicts]{.underline}** -- **[many of which are characterized by
persistent low-level violence, a "gray zone" of neither full peace nor
open warfare -- may get worse as urbanization, desertification,
demographic pressures, and changes in precipitation compound
tensions.]{.underline}**

### Agriculture US Key

#### Food price spikes trigger global conflict\-\--U.S. ag supply is key 

**CCGA 17** (The Chicago Council on Global Affairs - an independent,
nonpartisan think tank, "STABILITY IN THE 21ST CENTURY: GLOBAL FOOD
SECURITY FOR PEACE AND PROSPERITY," 3/30/17,
https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/stability-21st-century-global-food-security-peace-and-prosperity)

[America is facing enormous global challenges]{.underline} at the
beginning of 2017, [including the threat of rapidly increasing **global
instability, conflict, and migration as a result of inadequate global
food supplies**]{.underline} and water scarcity. Today's global
population of 7.4 billion people is expected to grow to 8 billion by
2024 and 10 billion by 2056.1 In addition, rising incomes in many low-
and middle-income countries are further increasing the demand for food
to satisfy the desire for higher quality, more nutritious, and diverse
diets. Yet we have never been as well equipped as we are today to
respond to these challenges. [Bipartisan leadership from the United
States and action by the global community over the past 25 years has led
to impressive results in the fight against the destabilizing forces of
food insecurity. The US government, in close cooperation with the
private sector and university system, is well positioned to expand its
legacy of commitment to food security and not only bolster the
livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers and entrepreneurs around
the world, but also open up new business opportunities and partnerships
in emerging economies.]{.underline} Global food and nutrition security
is in America's national security and economic interests Food security
promotes national security. Particularly in urban areas of low- and
middle-income countries, [**high food prices** and reduced access to
food can trigger protests and rioting, including **armed conflict**,
that lead to political and economic instability with **global
consequences.**]{.underline}2 The global food crisis of 2007-08
demonstrated how [spikes in food prices can plunge millions into hunger
and deeper poverty]{.underline}, sparking riots that can undermine
progress for years. The food price crisis hit hardest in countries with
systems that were least able to respond effectively to global price
volatility. For example, food price--related protests toppled
governments in Haiti and Madagascar in 2007 and 2008. In 2010 and 2011
food prices and grievances related to food policy were one of the major
drivers of the Arab Spring.3 Food insecurity can also be a powerful
driver for migration. Despite ongoing conflicts, much of today's global
migration crisis is driven by economic factors, as millions of people
flee hunger and poverty in their countries. On the other hand, countries
that have achieved sustained development progress and greater food
security are less susceptible to volatility and violence. Food security
promotes stability and economic opportunity. [Greater prosperity and
economic growth in low-income countries create new and expanding
markets, presenting growth opportunities for American farmers, ranchers,
and businesses.]{.underline} For instance, in Africa alone the value of
the agriculture and food sector is expected to reach \$1 trillion by
2030.4 Rising incomes and changing diets are increasing demand for more
diverse and nutritious foods. As economies grow, so does the demand for
agricultural products, benefiting farmers locally and globally. Growing
economic opportunities in the agriculture sector reach well beyond food
production into sales of machinery and inputs, growth in demand for
consumer packaged goods, and digital technologies for agriculture, where
American companies are global leaders.

#### The US is key to world agriculture\-\--decline causes global instability

**Horwich 12** (Jeff, Interim host of Marketplace Morning Report and Rob
Bailey, Royal Institute of International Affairs, "U.S. drought could
have global impact on food prices," '12,
http://www.marketplace.org/topics/world/us-drought-could-have-global-impact-food-prices)

Bailey: Well [America is an]{.underline} **[agricultural
superpower]{.underline}** as well as a traditional global superpower, so
[it\'s the biggest producer of maize in the world, it\'s the biggest
producer of soy beans]{.underline} in the world. So [as soon as there\'s
a decrease in U.S. agricultural production]{.underline}, [that has
**massive effects**]{.underline} **[for the global
economy]{.underline}**. [These]{.underline} sorts of **[price impacts
could ripple across economies]{.underline}** across borders. Horwich:
And [geopolitically, let\'s]{.underline} just [think back a few years
when food prices start to rocket]{.underline} in some parts of the
world, crazy **[things can happen]{.underline}**. Bailey: Absolutely, if
[you think back to 2008 in Haiti]{.underline} [the
government]{.underline} [actually fell as a result of riots connected to
food prices]{.underline}. Fast forward a couple more years to 2011, [the
Arab Spring]{.underline} actually [was sparked]{.underline} [by initial
protests]{.underline} in a number of countries **[about the price of
bread]{.underline}** because the price of wheat had gone up in response
to export bans following a really bad harvest in Russia and Ukraine
after a heat wave and wild fires there. Horwich: Are there any
particular flash points that you are looking at this time around?
Bailey: [The situation in the Middle East remains]{.underline} much [the
same]{.underline}, [there is still **huge political vulnerability to a
spike in wheat prices**]{.underline}. [The other thing]{.underline} that
[the U.S. is having a big impact on is soy bean prices]{.underline}. But
if we see a very sharp increase soy bean prices, you can expect meat
prices to rise and this could actually have implications for China,
quite seriously.

#### US ag is critical to global food security and low food prices 

**Gore 15** (Anna Applefield Gore is a research associate with the
Global Food Security Project at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies. "U.S. has crucial role to play in reducing world
hunger" Feb. 07, 2015

swap

**[The world is facing real and complex challenges to reducing global
hunger]{.underline}**, **[and the United States has a crucial role to
play in overcoming them]{.underline}**. The world today has more than 7
billion people, 800 million of whom do not receive enough food to be
healthy, and the global population is expected to pass 9 billion by
2050. The areas of the world where populations are growing the fastest
are the same areas where hunger is most prevalent: Africa and Asia.
Especially in sub-Saharan Africa, **[food systems are not equipped to
feed their current populations]{.underline}**, never mind their rapidly
expanding ones. At the same time populations are expanding, they are
also becoming more urban. In 2030, **[two-thirds of the world\'s
population will be urban, compounding the challenge of getting food to
those who need it]{.underline}**. Urban populations demand more
processed foods and meats, which are more resource-intensive to produce.
These trends will drastically increase the strain we are putting on our
already limited natural resources. The rapid economic growth of cities
is also causing urban migration, which pulls people from rural areas,
reducing the overall number of investments in rural infrastructure.
**[It is against this demographic backdrop that we must
assess]{.underline}** the future of **[the American agriculture
sector]{.underline}**. Increasingly, our food system is shared and
global in nature. Currently, about 12% of food crosses borders because
of trade, and that number is growing rapidly, having doubled since 2006.
**[Agriculture is a substantial part of the U.S. economy]{.underline}**;
totaling over \$115 billion in exports annually. **[As a global leader
in agriculture, the U.S. has the potential to be a major player in
getting food to those who need it]{.underline}** and sharing its wealth
of knowledge and expertise with farmers in developing countries.
**[American foreign assistance has a history of commitments to
agricultural development]{.underline}**, which peaked in the 1960s and
has subsequently declined. President Barack **[Obama\'s Feed the Future
program has re-ignited that work]{.underline}**; helping teach farmers
new farming practices, giving them loans to afford new and improved
inputs and making investments in rural infrastructure to improve market
access**[. Our Food for Peace program provides more than 1 million
metric tons in food aid]{.underline}** annually to those in need, as
well. But some of the most effective work in this area is simple,
straightforward exchange programs between American and African farmers,
in which American farmers help Africans troubleshoot and solve
agricultural problems. There are many ways American farmers and
agricultural experts can export their knowledge to those who need it in
the developing world. The U.S. Agency for International Development\'s
Farmer-to-Farmer program has helped more than 1 million farmers since
its creation in 1985, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture has similar
programs run out of its Foreign Agriculture Service. **[USAID also funds
innovation labs and collaborative research support
programs]{.underline}** that form long-term university partnerships
between American land grant institutions and African university
agricultural research centers. Many agriculturally oriented
non-governmental organizations have farmer exchange programs as well. In
addition to reducing global hunger, **[these investments in agricultural
development go to the core of the the United State\'s self-interest. We
are the biggest global exporter of corn]{.underline}**, and one of every
three acres of U.S. farmland is planted for export. The global
agricultural trade system is a delicate balance that requires
predictability and effective diplomatic relationships in order to
function. These major demographic shifts throughout the developing world
will surely change the balance of global trade, and building capacity
and trust in areas of growth allows the U.S. to preserve and grow its
export markets. Finally, **[this work protects our national security
interests]{.underline}**. **[In 2008-\'09, there were riots in over 20
countries ranging from Latin America to Europe to the Middle East due to
a massive food price crisis.]{.underline}** It is also famously
recounted that the Arab Spring started when a man\'s produce cart
business was shut down due to corrupt enforcement of agricultural
policies, and he set himself on fire in protest.

**[Improving global food security should be a U.S.
priority]{.underline}** because it is the right thing to do and it will
create new market opportunities for American agriculture in the long
run, said Stephanie Mercier, a senior policy and advocacy adviser for
the Farm Journal Foundation. A more stable world **[Recognizing a U.S.
tradition of aiding in world food relief dating back to World War I and
including the Marshall Plan after World War II]{.underline}**, Mercier
noted that **[encouraging food security also promotes a more stable
world]{.underline}**. "**[The World Bank has done research that shows a
country facing extreme poverty and hunger faces a much higher
probability in any given year of seeing internal conflict erupt either
in the form of a civil war or a military coup]{.underline}**," she said.
Mercier noted that **[the U.S. ability to help]{.underline}** countries
improve their economies **[has frequently led to]{.underline}** the
creation of **[new opportunities]{.underline}** for U.S. exports.
**[Fifty percent of U.S. agricultural exports go to developing
countries]{.underline}**, she said, and six of the world's fastest
growing economies are in sub-Saharan Africa.

### Disease

#### Ratification solves IP innovation and disease 

**Acri 19** (Kristina received B.A. degrees in Economics and Latin

**[Congress is expected to vote on an updated trade agreement with
Canada and Mexico in the coming months. The new deal]{.underline}** \--
the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \-- **[includes strong intellectual
property protections for certain]{.underline}** complex prescription
**[drugs. These provisions should be cause for
celebration,]{.underline}** especially for patients. **[The protections
will incentivize biopharmaceutical research and encourage]{.underline}**
the development of **[future cures.]{.underline}** **[The global health
landscape is full of good news]{.underline}** and reason for hope.
**[Since 2000, more than 500 new medicines have been approved by the
FDA. Those drugs have extended and enhanced millions of]{.underline}**
people\'s **[lives]{.underline}**. Globally, there are more than 7,000
medicines in development to treat and cure a vast array of diseases and
afflictions. And 74 percent of those experimental drugs are potentially
first-in-class, meaning they treat disease in an entirely novel way.
**[Of the medicines in development, the lion\'s share]{.underline}** \--
more than 5,000 \-- **[come from]{.underline}** labs in **[the United
States. This is not coincidental.]{.underline}** This
**[research]{.underline}** takes place in the United States because it
**[is incentivized and rewarded here through robust intellectual
property protections. The United States has taken]{.underline}**
particular **[care to protect biologics,]{.underline}** which are
complex drugs derived from living organisms. **[Existing U.S. law grants
12 years of \"regulatory data protection\" for biologics]{.underline}**.
During this period, generic drug companies can\'t use a biologic
manufacturer\'s research data when developing their own copycat
medications, known as biosimilars. **[This 12-year window was
established by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation
Act,]{.underline}** which received broad bipartisan support in Congress
and was signed into law by President Obama in 2010. It gives innovators
a chance to recoup their development costs and plow money into
additional research. **[The USMCA sets the minimum term of biologic data
protection at 10 years.]{.underline}** Currently, Canada only offers
eight years of data protection while Mexico provides five years, at
most. In other words, **[the new trade deal will offer more robust
protections to medical innovators who sell their products]{.underline}**
in those two nations. **[Without such protections, investors would have
little incentive to pour money into]{.underline}** expensive and risky
**[drug discovery.]{.underline}** Current estimates indicate that the
cost of bringing a single drug to market is \$2.6 billion and requires
between 10 and 15 years. Moreover, only 12 percent of experimental drugs
that reach clinical trials are ultimately approved by the FDA. Critics
incorrectly argue that increasing IP protections will keep drug prices
high by delaying the introduction of cheaper biosimilars. But the
evidence indicates otherwise. A study by the Council on Foreign
Relations found that \"**[national drug spending has remained flat as a
share of overall health expenditure in the countries with recent U.S.
trade agreements. The growth in per capita pharmaceutical spending in
these countries is in line with nations of similar income]{.underline}**
that have not entered into U.S. trade deals and have no market
exclusivity requirements.\" This makes sense, since **[the provisions in
USMCA in no way prevent biosimilar firms from bringing their products to
market.]{.underline}** Rather, **[biosimilar producers are merely
prevented from relying on an innovator\'s data]{.underline}** to secure
regulatory approval. Biosimilar firms are still able to bring their
products to market, as long as they generate their own data establishing
the products\' safety and efficacy. In fact, **[strengthening IP
protection could]{.underline}** actually **[lower drug prices by
increasing the availability of breakthrough treatments and cures. More
drugs would lead to more competition, which will drive down prices
across the board.]{.underline}** We see this happen all the time. In
2014, Gilead released Sovaldi, an \$84,000 cure for Hepatitis C. That
price was roundly criticized, but it didn\'t last. **[As]{.underline}**
multiple **[competing cures entered the market, Gilead felt pressure to
lower prices.]{.underline}** In 2018, the company announced it would
start selling the medicine for less than a third of the original list
price. **[The provisions in USMCA reflect the delicate balance between
ensuring that pharmaceutical innovation is available]{.underline}** to
all, **[while]{.underline}** also **[rewarding the
innovator.]{.underline}** Without such protections, biopharmaceutical
innovators would scale back their investments in risky, expensive,
time-consuming drug development. **[If Congress desires medical
breakthroughs, passing USMCA should be a foregone
conclusion.]{.underline}**

What is at stake? **[In the 5th and 14th century, Plague

Smallpox in humans and Rinderpest in animals, and two more diseases --
Guinea Worm and Polio -- are close to being eradicated. **[Progress in
medical treatment and public health systems has significantly reduced
the prevalence and impact]{.underline}** of others, such as Malaria,
Typhus and Cholera. **[However, there remains a serious risk that the
emergence of a new infectious disease in humans could cause a major

densely populated, urbanized and highly interconnected
world.]{.underline}** How much do we know? **[Catastrophic
pandemics]{.underline}** -- diseases with high lethality that spread
globally -- **[are extremely disruptive]{.underline}**, but very rare.
Outbreaks of lethal diseases that remain locally contained or pandemics
with less acute effects on human health are however more common, and can
have significant disruptive effects. **[Outbreaks occur when a
micro-organism]{.underline}** -- virus, bacteria, parasite, etc. --
**[is able to spread across the population]{.underline}**. At times and
under certain conditions, such as failure of water or sanitation
systems, an outbreak is caused by a micro-organism known to be
circulating at low levels in human populations. At others, an outbreak
is caused by a micro-organism that has crossed the animal/human species
barrier to infect humans, and spreads to new and more densely populated
areas. If mutation occurs, virulence can increase or decrease. Mutation
can also cause a micro-organism to transmit more easily from human to
human.

### A2 Tariffs Thump

#### Short term aid solves 

**Davis 18** (July 24^th^, 2018, Julie Davis writes for the New York
Times, "To Ease Pain of Trump's Trade War: \$12 Billion in Aid for
Farmers,"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/us/politics/farmers-aid-trade-war.html)

**[Agriculture Department officials said farmers could begin signing up
to receive the federal money in September]{.underline}**, just weeks
before voters go to the polls. **[The package includes direct payments
to the producers of soybeans, sorghum, corn, wheat, cotton, dairy and
hogs, who would be compensated according to the size of their harvests
this year. It will also include government purchases of surplus
products]{.underline}** --- including fruit, nuts, rice, legumes, beef,
pork and dairy --- **[that would be sent to food banks or other
nutrition programs.]{.underline}** Some of the funding would go to a
program in which the Agriculture Department works with private companies
to develop new export markets for American farm products. Mr. Trump and
his advisers have argued that while American producers may feel
short-term pain, ultimately they will benefit as other countries are
forced to lower their barriers to American products. Meantime, **[the
administration has sought ways to help farmers survive the pain of
retaliation. The program announced on Tuesday will be funded by the
Commodity Credit Corporation, which helps shore up American farmers by
buying their crops.]{.underline}**

"Exports Steady For Key Crops As Trade, Tariff Disputes Continue,"

**[Prices for crops like corn and soybeans have declined as the U.S. has
sparred with top trading partners, but]{.underline}** **[exports of
those crops have not plummeted]{.underline}** **[the way many observers
had feared.]{.underline}** **[Corn exports, for example, are up 3
percent over the previous marketing year]{.underline}**. (The marketing
year USDA uses for corn and soybeans runs from September 1 to August
31.) Soybean exports are down 3 percent, but Gregg Doud, the top
agriculture negotiator in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,
considers that to be an encouraging sign given the turmoil caused by
tariffs lobbed back and forth between the U.S. and China --- the largest
buyer of U.S. soybeans. Gregg Doud, the Chief Agricultural Negotiator in
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said **[steady trade numbers
are a good sign as negotiations continues with Canada and China. "What
we're seeing in these markets right now is that corn, soybeans, beef,
pork --- they've been really, really solid,"]{.underline}** Doud said
after meeting with leaders of Nebraska agriculture groups in Omaha on
Monday. **[Soybean exports to China are down 23 percent, but the overall
decline in exports was small thanks to larger shipments to countries
like Vietnam, Pakistan and Egypt, which has nearly tripled its soybean
imports from the U.S. this year.]{.underline}**

https://www.farmfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Trade-Analysis-10-31-18-Final.pdf)

The recently signed, though yet to be ratified, United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) should bring a sigh of relief to
U.S. farmers. It largely maintains the relatively free market access
across the three countries, particularly in agriculture. It improves
market access for U.S. dairy and poultry exports towards Canada,
providing a modest positive export bump in these sectors. However, the
new agreement, when implemented, is occurring in **[a new and volatile
trade policy environment]{.underline}** that **[is creating headwind for
U.S. farmers.]{.underline}** **[The steel and aluminum tariffs that have
targeted most of the U.S. trading partners including Canada, China and
Mexico, have been met with retaliatory measures that extend well beyond
these two metals.]{.underline}** **[Canada and Mexico have targeted a
broad number of U.S. agricultural exports]{.underline}** and China,
notably, has increased its tariff on U.S. soybean exports by 25%. The
modest market access improvements in the USMCA will lead to an expansion
of U.S. agricultural exports by \$450 million, mostly in the dairy and
poultry sectors. However, **[the retaliatory measures taken by Canada
and Mexico, in reaction to the U.S. decision to raise tariffs on their
exports of steel and aluminum, will cause U.S. agricultural exports to
decline by \$1.8 billion, and by \$1.9 billion to these key trading
partners.]{.underline}** In today's broader context of reactive trade
retaliation from countries around the world, the United States would see
a decline in agricultural exports of \$7.9 billion, thus overwhelming
the small positive gains from USMCA.

**[The]{.underline}** Trump administration\'s proposed
**[U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement]{.underline}** on trade **[would boost
the U.S. economy by \$68.2 billion and add 176,000 jobs, according to a
report released]{.underline}** Thursday **[by the U.S. International
Trade Commission, an independent federal agency]{.underline}**. The
analysis should aid passage of the deal, which would replace the 1993
North American Free Trade Agreement but is currently stalled in
Congress. The commission nevertheless said that the deal\'s impact would
be \"moderate\" in light of the trade agreements already in place with
Canada and Mexico. \"Because NAFTA has already eliminated duties on most
qualifying goods and significantly reduced nontariff measures,
**[USMCA's emphasis is on reducing]{.underline}** remaining **[nontariff
measures on trade and the]{.underline}** U.S.
**[economy]{.underline}**,\" the report said. **[The deal would
strengthen labor standards and rights]{.underline}**, especially those
in Mexico, **[increase intellectual property rights
protections]{.underline}** enjoyed by U.S. firms, **[and reduce the
scope of the system for settling disputes]{.underline}** between
investors and individual countries, likely leading to less U.S.
investment in Mexico --- and **[freeing up capital for domestic
manufacturing and mining]{.underline}**, according to the report. The
projected positive effect would be small, though. The Trump
administration is trying to booster support the deal\'s approval by
Congress and get it passed by this summer. It released a report Thursday
touting the deal as [adding 76,000 jobs to the domestic auto
industry](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/usmca-to-create-76-000-auto-industry-jobs-white-house-says).
U.S. Trade Representative Robert **[Lighthizer said the report\'s
findings \"validate\" the]{.underline}** administration\'s **[decision
to renegotiate NAFTA]{.underline}**. \"This report is an important step
forward in gaining congressional approval of the USMCA \... There can be
no doubt that **[the USMCA is a big win for America's
economy]{.underline}**,\" he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,
has been noncommittal about bringing it up for a vote, however, and
[many
Democrats](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/democrats-dig-in-on-nafta-replacement-as-mexico-move-forward)
have argued the administration should reopen talks with Canada and
Mexico. Business groups said the study showed that Congress should
embrace the deal. \"**[This agreement will level the playing
field]{.underline}** for manufacturers in the United States **[and
support the 2 million American manufacturing jobs]{.underline}** that
depend on our exports to Canada and Mexico," said Linda Dempsey, vice

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald **[Trump said]{.underline}** on
Thursday that **[Canada and Mexico are completely in line on the
new]{.underline}** North American **[trade deal and it is up to the
United States to get it passed]{.underline}**. Speaking to reporters at
the White House, **[Trump said he hoped Congress would quickly
move]{.underline}** to act on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, or
USMCA. Canada said on Thursday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau plans
to meet with Trump on June 20 in Washington to discuss ratification of
the accord. "Hopefully they can act quickly because we could have that
done very, very fast if we can get support from, really, the Democrats
in Congress, (House Speaker) Nancy **[Pelosi]{.underline}**, they
**[have to put the bill forward]{.underline}**," Trump said. The Trump
administration has been pushing Congress to speed up a vote on the
agreement. But **[the Democratic-led House]{.underline}** of
Representatives **[has sought more time to review the
deal]{.underline}**, with Pelosi pressing for improved enforcement
mechanisms for labor and environmental standards.
**[Republicans]{.underline}**, who control the U.S. Senate, **[have been
seeking a vote]{.underline}** on the USMCA **[before the August
recess]{.underline}** to avoid budget debates and 2020 presidential
campaign activity expected to intensify in the autumn. **[But Pelosi
controls the schedule for trade legislation in the House and USMCA does
not appear likely to come to a vote in that chamber during the
summer]{.underline}**. "I think that hopefully it's going to get
approved quickly," Trump told a roundtable with state governors.
"Everybody wants it. It's in Congress right now. It's in the House and
they're reviewing it. But everybody seems to want it." "As you know
Canada is totally in line and Mexico is totally in line and now it's up
to us to get it passed. And it's going to have a tremendous impact, I
think," he added, noting it would mean "a lot of money and a lot of
jobs."

**[AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said Tuesday that a set of labor
reform laws Mexico is poised to enact to fulfill its obligations under
President Trump\'s U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade do not go far
enough. Trumka\'s negative appraisal of the legislation indicates that
Mexico passing its reforms might not be sufficient to get U.S. Democrats
on board with the deal.]{.underline}** The Mexican legislature\'s lower
house passed a reform package last week as part its USMCA obligations
and the Mexican senate is expected to adopt it before before the end of
the month. **[House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., a major union

passed by one house \[in Mexico\], I think, meet the standard that was
put in the annex \[to USMCA\],\" Trumka told the Washington Examiner.
\"They still have another \[legislative\] step to go through. But that
is only part one. **[Even if you have those laws, that doesn\'t mean
that you have the ability or will to enforce them. What we want to see
is that they have the \[legal\] infrastructure \[in Mexico\] to support
the bill and the resources to do it.\" That would include renegotiating
175,000 existing Mexican union contracts created under the old system,
Trumka said. He]{.underline}** added that Mexico didn\'t need to do all
of that first but \"we want to see their ability to do that.\" That
would mainly require a new budget that allocated more to enforcement, he
said. **[Trumka recalled a recent meeting he was present at in which a
Mexican ambassador told a room full of outside business investors, \"I

#### Ending arms sales has bipartisan support -- empirics

**George**, 6/5/**2019** (Susannah, AP Intelligence Reporter, "Senators
launch bipartisan bid to block Saudi arms sales," Associated Press,
https://www.wate.com/news/politics/senators-launch-bipartisan-bid-to-block-saudi-arms-sales/2054416325)

WASHINGTON (AP) - **[Directly challenging]{.underline}** President
Donald **[Trump\'s use of executive power]{.underline}**, **[Democrats
and Republicans in the Senate are banding together to introduce more
than a dozen resolutions aimed at blocking the Trump administration\'s
sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. **[The maneuver amounts
to a remarkable display of bipartisan pushback to Trump\'s foreign
policy and threatens to tangle the Senate in a series of floor votes
this summer]{.underline}**. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top
Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is leading the
effort, but he has support from two of Trump\'s allies in Congress:
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky. **[Anger has
been mounting in Congress over the Trump administration\'s close ties to
the Saudis]{.underline}**, fueled by the high civilian casualties in the
Saudi-led war in Yemen - a military campaign the U.S. is assisting - and
the killing of U.S.-based columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents.
Trump\'s decision in May to sell the weapons, in a manner intended to
bypass congressional review, further inflamed the tensions. \"While I
understand that Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally, the behavior of
Mohammed bin Salman cannot be ignored. Now is not the time to do
business as usual with Saudi Arabia,\" Graham said in a statement
Wednesday. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that an operation
like the killing of Khashoggi could not have happened without the
knowledge of the powerful crown prince. Adding to the outcry, Sen. Tim
Kaine of Virginia revealed this week that the Trump administration
continued to transfer nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia even after
Khashoggi\'s murder. Kaine said that information, which he received from
the Department of Energy, added \"to a disturbing pattern of behavior\"
by the administration. **[Menendez\'s introduction of the 22 resolutions
Wednesday creates a challenge for Senate leadership, as he is using a
procedure that can force action on the Senate floor]{.underline}**.
Other supporters of the effort include Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of
Connecticut, a longtime critic of the war in Yemen, Republican Sen. Todd
Young of Indiana, and Democratic Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Jack
Reed of Rhode Island. The Trump administration in May invoked an
emergency provision in the Arms Export Control Act to push through \$8
billion worth of arms sales to the Saudis, the United Arab Emirates and
Jordan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the sales were necessary to
counter \"the malign influence of the government of Iran throughout the
Middle East region.\" Some of the weapons could be delivered later this
year, while other arms will not ship for another year or longer. The
sale included precision guided munitions, other bombs and ammunition and
aircraft maintenance support. \"We are in an unprecedented situation,\"
Menendez said, adding that the 22 resolutions had the potential to
\"close the Senate for some period of time\" due to the debate time that
would be allotted to each resolution. Menendez said he is asking the
administration to rescind the emergency declaration so the arms sales
can be considered by Congress. \"The question before the Senate is do
you want to be a separate co-equal branch of government, or do you want
to give this and future administrations a carte blanche,\" he said.
Congress has never before tried to block a sale pushed through by the
White House with an emergency declaration and it\'s unclear if the
resolutions introduced Wednesday will be successful, according to a
Senate aide. Senate leadership and the parliamentarian may ultimately
need to rule on whether it can proceed. The aide was not authorized to
discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. It
also remains to be seen if the resolutions can gain enough support to
overcome a likely presidential veto. **[Lawmakers blocked about \$2
billion in arms sales to the kingdom for more than a
year]{.underline}**, citing concerns over human rights. **[Separately,
Congress passed legislation this year that would have ended U.S. support
for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Trump vetoed the measure.]{.underline}**
Speaking from the Senate floor Wednesday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer
of New York threw his support behind the resolutions to block the arms
sales. \"Over the past year, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, despite some
positive domestic reforms, has too often acted like a brute in the
Middle East rather than a stabilizing force,\" Schumer said. He said
Congress should take a stand against Trump\'s Saudi policy and push back
against executive overreach. \"In America, we have a three-branch
government, not a one-branch government. Maybe some of our Republican
colleagues are recognizing that and beginning to act,\" he said.

But **[the abrupt emergence of the immigration and gun-control issues
illustrates how suddenly shifts in mood can occur and how political
interests can align in new ways just as suddenly]{.underline}**. Indeed,
**[the pseudo-concept of political capital masks a larger truth about
Washington that is kindergarten simple: You just don't know what you can
do until you try]{.underline}**. Or as Ornstein himself once wrote years
ago, "**[Winning wins]{.underline}**." **[In theory, and in practice,
depending on Obama's handling of any particular issue, even in a
polarized time, he could still deliver on a lot of his second-term
goals]{.underline}**, depending on his skill and the breaks. Unforeseen
catalysts can appear, like Newtown. Epiphanies can dawn, such as when
many Republican Party leaders suddenly woke up in panic to the huge
disparity in the Hispanic vote.¶ Some political scientists who study the
elusive calculus of how to pass legislation and run successful
presidencies say that **[political capital is, at best, an empty
concept]{.underline}**, and that **[almost nothing in the academic
literature successfully quantifies or even defines it]{.underline}**.
"It can refer to a very abstract thing, like a president's popularity,
but there's no mechanism there. That makes it kind of useless," says
Richard Bensel, a government professor at Cornell University. **[Even
Ornstein concedes that the calculus is far more complex than the term
suggests. Winning on one issue often changes the calculation for the
next issue; there is never any known amount of capital]{.underline}**.
"The idea here is, **[if an issue comes up where the conventional wisdom
is that president is not going to get what he wants, and he gets it,
then each time that happens, it changes the calculus of the other
actors" Ornstein says. "If they think he's going to win, they may change
positions to get on the winning side. It's a bandwagon
effect]{.underline}**."

**[Presidents rely heavily on Congress in converting their political

reelection prospects of presidents, but it also builds the president's
reputation for political effectiveness and fuels the prospect for
subsequent gains in political capital]{.underline}** (Light 1982).
Moreover, the president's legislative success in foreign policy is
correlated with success on the domestic front. On this point, some have
largely disavowed the two-presidencies distinction while others have
even argued that foreign policy has become a mere extension of domestic
policy (Fleisher et al. 2000; Oldfield and Wildavsky 1989) **[Presidents
implicitly understand that there exists a linkage between their actions
in one policy area and their ability to affect another]{.underline}**.
The use of force is no exception; in promoting and protecting U.S.
interests abroad, presidential decisions are made with an eye toward
managing political capital at home (Fordham 2002).

Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., fretted that "tribalism" was on the rise in
American politics and "is ruining us." "I'm so tempted to use the 'l'

when describing the tactics of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky. "But he's my friend." Schumer instead tempered the aspersion
directed at his Senate counterpart as a "blatant falsehood." "Boy, ya'll
want power!" spat Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., across the dais at
Democrats at the second confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice
Brett Kavanaugh.. "God, I hope you never get it." After delivering his
closing floor speech in opposition to Kavanaugh, Sen. Ed Markey,
D-Mass., lamented that the Senate has "hit rock bottom." [Lawmakers
shredded civility like a Banksy painting at Sotheby's during the
confirmation fight over Brett Kavanaugh.]{.underline} Angst and enmity
often consume Capitol Hill when big issues split the sides. The rise of
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and the 1994 Republican
takeover of the House. Multiple government shutdowns. The impeachment of
President Clinton. The Bush administration's handling of the Iraq War.
The skirmish to approve ObamaCare. A monumental 2011 fight over the debt
ceiling. The 2013 government shutdown over repealing ObamaCare. And now,
Kavanaugh. The rancor spilled over the Kavanaugh confirmation ranks
right up there with some of the most intense imbroglios in Washington
over the past quarter century. You know it's tense in Congress when the
workers who operate the trolleys which shuttle people back and forth
from the Russell Senate Office Building and the Capitol start
browbeating aides and journalists. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is the
lone Republican to oppose Kavanaugh. She didn't cast a ballot for or
against the nominee. Instead, Murkowski "paired" her vote with Sen.
Steve Daines, R-Mont. Daines backed Kavanaugh but couldn't cast a ballot
due his daughter's wedding. So neither registered their view on the
Senate floor. Still, President Trump and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin
(R) directed invective at Alaska's senior senator. New York Yankees fans
were more gentle with Aaron Boone after some of his managerial decisions
in the playoffs than some Republicans were with Murkowski. "The Senate
is no place for sissies," said Murkowski. "The feelings are pretty raw."
She added that Senate's ebb "feels lower than any place I have ever
been." Murkowski huddled with a scrum off reporters in the Senate
Reception Room just off the floor after the historic confirmation vote.
A reporter asked Murkowski what she thought about when listening to the
screams from protesters, blasting senators as they cast their ballots
inside the chamber. "I was closing my eyes and praying," said Murkowski.
"Praying for them. Praying for us. I'm praying for the country. We need
prayers. We need healing." [Congress is a hemorrhaging gash right now,
bleeding odium and hostility..... Or.... Is it? Step back from the

parties in both chambers [accomplished in September and early October,

first revamp of national aviation policy in years.]{.underline} The
Senate approved the final version of the legislation 93-6. This came
after a staggering six extensions due to bickering and disagreement.

adopted the measure 98-1. And, [there was no government

bipartisan bills which funded five of the 12 annual spending bills which
operate the government. The sides agreed to latch an additional measure
to one of the spending plans to fund the remaining seven areas of
federal spending through December 7. President Trump briefly threatened
to force a government shutdown if lawmakers didn't include money for his
border wall in the plan. But the President ultimately punted that battle
until December. Democrats praised Republicans for keeping conservative
"poison pill" riders out of the appropriations bills. That decision drew
Democratic support for the measures. [The Senate approved a bipartisan
water and infrastructure package.]{.underline} McConnell hailed the
bipartisanship which descended upon the Senate -- even as the senators
fought over Kavanaugh. Nearly in the same breath, McConnell derided
boisterous, anti-Kavanaugh protesters outside the Capitol as a "mob."
McConnell insisted this week he needed the Senate to clear a slate of 15
conservative judges to lower courts before he could cut senators loose
for the midterm elections. McConnell and Schumer appeared at
loggerheads. McConnell's goal was clear: extract the confirmation of
these nominees -- or tether to Washington vulnerable Democratic senators
from battleground states to keep them off the campaign trail. Schumer
knew McConnell would ultimately prevail on the nominees after the
midterms. So the New York Democrat accepted McConnell's ransom,
permitting the Senate vote on a slate of nominees on Thursday night.
Schumer also extracted a concession from McConnell: send senators home
until November 13th. [One may wonder how lawmakers can find themselves
in an imbroglio over a major issue like Kavanaugh -- yet forge major
bipartisan accords on another. Frankly, **that's just politics**.
Politics always elicits strange bedfellows. **Successful lawmakers know
they should compartmentalize their disputes.** The enemy today may be

### Agriculture

#### Food shortage doesn't cause war -- best studies

**Allouche 11**, research Fellow -- water supply and sanitation @
Institute for Development Studies, frmr professor -- MIT (Jeremy, "The
sustainability and resilience of global water and food systems:
Political analysis of the interplay between security, resource scarcity,
political systems and global trade," Food Policy, Vol. 36 Supplement 1,
p. S3-S8, January)

The question of resource scarcity has led to many **[debates on whether
scarcity]{.underline}** (whether **[of food or water]{.underline}**)
**[will lead to conflict]{.underline}** and war. The underlining
reasoning behind most of these discourses over food and water wars
**[comes from the Malthusian belief that there is an imbalance
between]{.underline}** the economic availability of natural **[resources
and population growth]{.underline}** since while food production grows
linearly, population increases exponentially. Following this reasoning,
neo-Malthusians claim that finite natural resources place a strict limit
on the growth of human population and aggregate consumption; if these
limits are exceeded, social breakdown, conflict and wars result.
Nonetheless, it seems that **[most empirical studies do not
support]{.underline}** any of **[these]{.underline}** neo-Malthusian
**[arguments.]{.underline}** **[Tech]{.underline}**nological change
**[and]{.underline}** greater inputs of **[capital have dramatically
increased]{.underline}** labour **[productivity]{.underline}** in
agriculture. More generally, **[the neo-Malthusian view has suffered
because]{.underline}** during the last two centuries **[humankind has
breached]{.underline}** many [**resource barriers that seemed
unchallengeable.**]{.underline} Lessons from history: alarmist
scenarios, resource wars and international relations In a so-called age
of uncertainty, a number of **[alarmist scenarios]{.underline}** have
**[linked]{.underline}** the increasing **[use of water resources and
food insecurity with wars.]{.underline}** The idea of water wars
(perhaps more than food wars) is a dominant discourse in the media (see
for example Smith, 2009), NGOs (International Alert, 2007) and within
international organizations (UNEP, 2007). In 2007, UN Secretary General
Ban Ki-moon declared that 'water scarcity threatens economic and social
gains and is a potent fuel for wars and conflict' (Lewis, 2007). Of
course, this type of discourse has an instrumental purpose; security and
conflict are here used for raising water/food as key policy priorities
at the international level. **[In the Middle East]{.underline}**,
presidents, prime ministers and **[foreign ministers have]{.underline}**
also **[used this bellicose rhetoric.]{.underline}** Boutrous
Boutros-Gali said; 'the next war in the Middle East will be over water,
not politics' (Boutros Boutros-Gali in Butts, 1997, p. 65). The question
is not whether the sharing of transboundary water sparks political
tension and alarmist declaration, but rather to what extent water has
been a principal factor in international conflicts. **[The evidence
seems quite weak.]{.underline}** Whether by president Sadat in Egypt or
King Hussein in Jordan, [**none of these declarations have been followed
up by military action.**]{.underline} The governance of transboundary
water has gained increased attention these last decades. This has a
direct impact on the global food system as water allocation agreements
determine the amount of water that can used for irrigated agriculture.
The likelihood of conflicts over water is an important parameter to
consider in assessing the stability, sustainability and resilience of
global food systems. **[None of the various and extensive databases on
the causes of war show water as a casus belli.]{.underline}** Using the
International Crisis Behavior (ICB) data set and supplementary data from
the University of Alabama on water conflicts, **[Hewitt, Wolf and Hammer
found only seven disputes where water seems to have been at least a
partial cause]{.underline}** for conflict (Wolf, 1998, p. 251). In fact,
about **[80% of the incidents relating to water were
limited]{.underline}** purely **[to governmental rhetoric]{.underline}**
intended for the electorate (Otchet, 2001, p. 18). As shown in The
Basins At Risk (BAR) water event database, **[more than two-thirds
of]{.underline}** over **[1800 water]{.underline}**-related '**[events'
fall on the 'cooperative' scale]{.underline}** (Yoffe et al., 2003).
Indeed, if one takes into account a much longer period, the following
figures clearly demonstrate this argument. According to studies by the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), **[organized
political bodies signed]{.underline}** between the year 805 and 1984
**[more than 3600 water-related treaties]{.underline}**, and
approximately 300 treaties dealing with water management or allocations
in international basins have been negotiated since 1945 (FAO, 1978 and
FAO, 1984). The fear around water wars have been driven by a Malthusian
outlook which equates scarcity with violence, conflict and war. **[There
is]{.underline}** however **[no]{.underline}** direct **[correlation
between water scarcity and transboundary conflict.]{.underline}** Most
specialists now tend to agree that the major issue is not scarcity per
se but rather the allocation of water resources between the different
riparian states (see for example Allouche, 2005, Allouche, 2007 and
\[Rouyer, 2000\] ). **[Water rich countries have been involved
in]{.underline}** a number of **[disputes with other]{.underline}**
relatively **[water rich countries]{.underline}** (see for example
India/Pakistan or Brazil/Argentina). The perception of each state's
estimated water needs really constitutes the core issue in transboundary
water relations. Indeed, whether this scarcity exists or not in reality,
**[perceptions of the amount of available water]{.underline}** shapes
people's attitude towards the environment (Ohlsson, 1999). In fact, some
water experts have argued that scarcity **[drives]{.underline}** the
process of **[co-operation among riparians]{.underline}** (Dinar and
Dinar, 2005 and Brochmann and Gleditsch, 2006). In terms of
international relations, **[the threat of water wars]{.underline}** due
to increasing scarcity **[does not make]{.underline}** much **[sense in
the light of the recent historical record.]{.underline}** Overall, the
water war rationale expects conflict to occur over water, and appears to
suggest that violence is a viable means of securing national water
supplies, an argument which is highly contestable. The **[debates
over]{.underline}** the likely impacts of **[climate
change]{.underline}** have again **[popularised]{.underline}** the idea
of **[water wars.]{.underline}** The argument runs that climate change
will precipitate worsening ecological conditions contributing to
resource scarcities, social breakdown, institutional failure, mass
migrations and in turn cause greater political instability and conflict
(Brauch, 2002 and Pervis and Busby, 2004). In a report for the US
Department of Defense, Schwartz and Randall (2003) speculate about the
consequences of a worst-case climate change scenario arguing that water
shortages will lead to aggressive wars (Schwartz and Randall, 2003, p.
15). **[Despite growing concern that climate change will lead to
instability and violent conflict, the evidence base to substantiate the
connections is thin]{.underline}** ( \[Barnett and Adger, 2007\] and
Kevane and Gray, 2008).

#### No food wars\-\--no [causal]{.underline} evidence, only [maybe]{.underline} true for the poorest countries, and [government responses]{.underline} solve the impact 

Mark W. **Rosegrant 13**, Director of the Environment and Production
Technology Division at the International Food Policy Research Institute,
et al., 2013, "The Future of the Global Food Economy: Scenarios for
Supply, Demand, and Prices," in Food Security and Sociopolitical
Stability, p. 39-40

The **[food price spikes in the late 2000s]{.underline}** caught the
world's attention, particularly when sharp increases in food and fuel
prices in 2008 **[coincided with street demonstrations and
riots]{.underline}** in many countries. For 2008 and the two preceding
years, researchers identified a significant number of countries
(totaling 54) with protests during what was called the global food
crisis (Benson et al. 2008). **[Violent protests occurred in 21
countries]{.underline}**, and nonviolent protests occurred in 44
countries. Both types of protest took place in 11 countries. In a
separate analysis, developing countries with low government
effectiveness experienced more food price protests between 2007 and 2008
than countries with high government effectiveness (World Bank 201la).
Although the incidence of violent protests was much higher in countries
with less capable governance, **[many factors could be causing or
contributing to these protests, such as government response tactics,
rather than the initial food price spike]{.underline}**. Data on food
riots and food prices have tracked together in recent years.
Agricultural commodity prices started strengthening in international
markets in 2006. In the latter half of 2007, as prices continued to
rise, two or fewer food price riots per month were recorded (based on
World Food Programme data, as reported in Brinkman and Hendrix 2011). As
prices peaked and remained high during mid-2008, the number of riots
increased dramatically, with a cumulative total of 84 by August 2008.
Subsequently, both prices and the monthly number of protests declined.
Several researchers have studied the connection between food price
shocks and conflict, finding at least some relationship between food
prices and conflict. According to Dell et al. (2008), **[higher food
prices lead to income declines and an increase in political instability,
but only for poor countries]{.underline}**. Researchers also found a
positive and significant relationship between weather shocks (affecting
food availability, prices, and real income) and the probability of
suffering government repression or a civil war (Besley and Persson
2009). Arezki and Bruckner (2011) evaluated a constructed food price
index and political variables, including data on riots and
anti-government demonstrations and measures of civil unrest. Using
**[data from 61 countries]{.underline}** over the period 1970 to 2007,
they **[found a direct connection between food price shocks and an
increased likelihood of civil conflict, including riots and
demonstrations]{.underline}**. **[Other researchers have broadened the
analysis by considering government responses]{.underline}** or
underlying policies **[that]{.underline}** affect local prices, and
consequently **[influence outcomes and the linkage between food price
shocks and conflict. Carter and Bates]{.underline}** (2012) **[evaluated
data from 30 developing countries]{.underline}** for the time period
1961 to 2001, **[concluding]{.underline}** that **[when governments
mitigate the impact of food price shocks on urban consumers, the
apparent relationship between food price shocks and civil war
disappears]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[when]{.underline}** the **[urban
consumers]{.underline}** can **[expect a favorable
response,]{.underline}** the **[protests only serve as a motivation for
a policy response rather than as a prelude to something more serious,
such as violent demonstrations or]{.underline}** even **[civil
war]{.underline}**. Many in the international development community see
war and conflict as a development issue, with a war or conflict severely
damaging the local economy, which in turn leads to forced migration and
dislocation, and ultimately acute food insecurity. **[Brinkman and
Hendrix]{.underline}** (2011) **[ask if it could be]{.underline}** the
other way around, with **[food insecurity causing conflict. Their
answer]{.underline}**, based on a review of the literature, **[is \"a
highly qualified yes]{.underline}**,\" **[especially for intrastate
conflict]{.underline}**. The primary reason is that insecurity itself
heightens the risk of democratic breakdown and civil conflict. **[The
linkage connecting food insecurity to conflict is contingent on levels
of economic development (a stronger linkage for poorer
countries]{.underline}**), existing political institutions, **[and other
factors]{.underline}**. The researchers say **[establishing causation
directly is elusive, considering a lack of evidence]{.underline}** for
explaining individual behavior. The debate over cause and effect is
ongoing. **[Policies can]{.underline}** nevertheless be implemented to
**[reduce price variability. Less costly forms of
stabilization]{.underline}**, at least in terms of government outlays,
**[include reducing import tariffs]{.underline}** (and quotas) **[to
lower prices and restricting exports to increase food
availability]{.underline}**. However, these types of policy responses,
while perhaps helping an individual country\'s consumers in the short
run, can lead to increased international price volatility, with
potential for disproportionate adverse impacts on other countries that
also may be experiencing food insecurity.

### Disease

#### No extinction- burnout

Pittsburgh \[Amesh, "Why Hasn\'t Disease Wiped out the Human Race?"

Accessed 5 July 2017\]

In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the
disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe threatens the human race with
extinction, and humanity's best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy
organism. Fortunately, **[outside of fiction, there's no reason to
expect alien pathogens to wage war on the human race any time
soon]{.underline}**, and my analysis suggests that **[any real-life
domestic microbe reaching an extinction level of threat probably is just
as unlikely.]{.underline}** When humans began to focus their minds on
the problems posed by infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty,
brutish, and short. **[Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to possess a
very special combination of two attributes. First, it would have to be
so unfamiliar that no existing therapy or vaccine could be applied to
it. Second, it would need to have a high and surreptitious
transmissibility before symptoms occur. The first is essential because
any microbe from a known class of pathogens would]{.underline}**, by
definition, **[have family members that could serve as models for
containment and countermeasures. The second would allow the hypothetical
disease to spread without being detected by even the most astute
clinicians. The three infectious diseases most likely to be considered
extinction-level threats in the world today---influenza, HIV, and
Ebola---don't meet these two requirements]{.underline}**.
**[Influenza]{.underline}**, for instance, **[despite its
well-established ability to kill on a large scale]{.underline}**, its
contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift away from
our vaccines, **[is still what I would call a "known
unknown."]{.underline}** While there are many mysteries about how new
flu strains emerge, from at least the time of Hippocrates, **[humans
have been attuned to its risk. And in the modern era, a full-fledged
industry of influenza preparedness exists, with effective vaccine
strategies and antiviral therapies. HIV]{.underline}**, which has killed
39 million people over several decades, **[is similarly limited due to
several factors.]{.underline}** Most importantly, **[HIV's dependency on
blood and body fluid for transmission]{.underline}** (similar to Ebola)
**[requires intimate human-to-human contact, which limits
contagion]{.underline}**. Highly potent antiviral therapy allows most
people to live normally with the disease, and a substantial group of the
population has genetic mutations that render them impervious to
infection in the first place. Lastly, **[simple prevention strategies
such as needle exchange for injection drug users and barrier
contraceptives]{.underline}**---when available---**[can curtail
transmission risk. Ebola]{.underline}**, for many of the same reasons as
HIV as well as several others, **[also falls short of the mark. This is
especially due to the fact that it spreads almost exclusively through
people with easily recognizable symptoms]{.underline}**, plus the taming
of its once unfathomable 90 percent mortality rate by simple supportive
care. Beyond those three, **[every other known disease falls short of
what seems required to wipe out humans]{.underline}**---**[which
is]{.underline}**, of course, **[why we're still here. And it's not that
diseases are ineffective]{.underline}**. On the contrary, diseases'
failure to knock us out is a testament to just how resilient humans
are**[. Part of our evolutionary heritage is our immune system, one of
the most complex on the planet, even without the benefit of vaccines or
the helping hand of antimicrobial drugs. This system, when viewed at a
species level, can adapt to almost any enemy imaginable]{.underline}**.
**[Coupled to genetic variations amongst humans---which open up the
possibility for a range of advantages, from imperviousness to infection
to a tendency for mild symptoms]{.underline}**---**[this adaptability
ensures that almost any infectious disease onslaught will leave a large
proportion of the population alive]{.underline}** to rebuild, in
contrast to the fictional Hollywood versions. While the immune system's
role can never be understated, **[an even more powerful protector is the
faculty of consciousness]{.underline}**. Humans are not the most
prolific, quickly evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet, but as
Aristotle identified, **[humans are the rational
animals]{.underline}**---and it is this fundamental distinguishing
characteristic that allows humans to form abstractions, think in
principles, and plan long-range. **[These capacities, in turn, allow
humans to modify, alter, and improve themselves and their environments.
Consciousness equips us, at an individual and a species level, to make
nature safe for the species through such technological marvels as
antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines, and sanitation]{.underline}**. When
humans began to focus their minds on the problems posed by infectious
disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short. In many
ways, human consciousness became infectious diseases' worthiest
adversary.
