Trade and security are the two policies most central to every nation's
wellbeing and most critical to every government's functioning. The
United States replaced the Articles of Confederation with the
Constitution in large part to give the nation control over trade policy.
The world's other great federation, the European Union, used trade
integration to rebuild itself after two catastrophic world wars. The
twenty-first century has been dominated by security considerations since
the attacks of September 11 turned the Bush presidency into a wartime
presidency. The 2016 presidential election marked a turning point. As
both the Republican and Democratic parties pursue policies aimed at
addressing voters' economic insecurity, **[[trade policy is once again
taking center stage.]{.underline}]{.mark}** At this moment,
understanding how our trade constitution came to be is critical to
understanding how our trade policy can and will be made going forward.
The country's rightful concern about a host of global
challenges---climate change, rogue regimes like North Korea, the rise of
China as a global power---make it tempting to revert to a trade policy
dominated by foreign policy considerations. Yet as President Obama's
ill-fated efforts to negotiate the TPP and justify it on foreign policy
grounds shows, **[[foreign policy considerations simply cannot carry the
weight of a domestic economic policy that so many Americans of both
parties feel no longer benefits them]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Trade
liberalization for its own sake---the utilitarian idea that we should
maximize aggregate national welfare through our trade policy without
concern for the distribution of the gains from that policy--- is an idea
whose time is past. Going forward, concerns about economic opportunity,
equality, and the distribution of the gains from our trade policies will
dominate our politics. How those concerns will shape that policy remains
to be seen. Protectionist policies like punitive tariffs and subsidies
(for manufacturers and displaced labor) redistribute wealth, although
they have very different trade implications. [**[A trade policy
dominated by the President is unable to deal comprehensively with
domestic concerns]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[[Only if Congress
participates as a full constitutional partner will the United States
have a sustainable trade liberalization]{.underline}]{.mark}** policy
that enjoys broad public support. Nothing legally or functionally
prevents Congress from reasserting its constitutional role. Whether it
will do so remains to be seen.

#### Carbon capture solves warming

**Brookings '16** "Fostering low carbon energy: Next generation policy
to commercialize CCS in the United States"
<https://www.brookings.edu/research/fostering-low-carbon-energy-next-generation-policy-to-commercialize-ccs-in-the-united-states/>

Next month, global leaders will convene in Paris for the United Nations
Conference on Climate Change. [Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction
strategies are important to reduce and manage the risks of climate
change. While the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix is
expected to increase, transitioning to a low carbon economy will take
time, and coal and natural gas are projected to play a prominent role in
the power and industrial sectors for a number of decades. Climate
mitigation technologies such as [carbon capture and storage]{.mark}
(CCS)---[an integrated process of capturing CO2 from power
generation]{.mark} or industrial activities and storing it permanently
via processing [or injection into suitable geological
formations]{.mark}--can [play an important role in global efforts to
limit GHG emissions.]{.mark} [CCS is a low-carbon technology]{.mark}
that can form part of a balanced portfolio approach to address climate
change, while also [offering economic and national security
advantages.]{.mark} Today, [CCS is the only technology that can
achieve]{.mark} significant [emissions reductions (90 percent]{.mark}
capture [or higher]{.mark}) from existing fossil fuel
infrastructure.]{.underline} Indeed, many studies have suggested that
unless CCS becomes a key part of a low carbon technology portfolio, it
is increasingly likely that energy-system carbon emissions will not be
reduced to levels that limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.
Climate change is an important global issue, and it has been well
documented that continued increases in global carbon emissions are
fueled predominantly by fossil fuel usage---particularly coal, and to a
lesser extent, oil and natural gas. [According to International Energy
Agency estimates over the next several
decades](http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/publications/weo-2014/), coal
will play a significant role in the global energy portfolio. While coal
demand in OECD countries is projected to fall by 2040, in non-OECD
economies such as Africa, India, China, Indonesia, Brazil, and Southeast
Asia, coal usage is projected to increase by a third. Coal offers a
cheap and abundant feedstock for electricity generation in many emerging
markets where increasing access to electricity is a priority. It is also
important to note that burning natural gas also results in substantial
amounts of CO2 emissions. Given that the International Energy Agency
projects the share of natural gas in the global energy mix to rise, CCS
for natural gas will, over time, also become a serious political and
environmental issue. While many countries support renewable energy in
order to shift away from reliance on fossil fuels, it is uncertain
whether this approach alone will achieve sufficient emissions reductions
to achieve the 2 degree Celsius target. [Low-emission technologies such
as [CCS can play a vital role]{.mark} in contributing [to global
mitigation efforts]{.mark}, and research has shown that in the long run
**[GHG emission reduction would be more
]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[expensive [without CCS
deployment.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [In our policy brief, we assess the
risks and barriers related to CCS at electricity plants, and the
existing policy framework to support its application. Our study aims to
identify the major obstacles facing CCS commercialization and offer
recommendations for policies that can spur technological innovation and
effect further cost reductions. The key conclusions we reached in our
analysis are as follows: CCS can meet environmental, economic, and
national security objectives: As a carbon disposal approach that can be
deployed on new or existing coal- or natural gas-fired power plants, CCS
can help in global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. Additionally,
**[positioning the ]{.mark}**]{.underline}**[United States [at the
forefront of CCS technology development fosters export markets for U.S.
companies, and]{.underline}]{.mark} [including [CCS in the global energy
technology portfolio lowers the costs of transitioning to a low carbon
economy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [Finally, [CCS bolsters national
security by offering a way to take advantage]{.mark} of abundant fossil
fuel resources while simultaneously meeting climate mitigation goals.
[Current policy does not adequately address CCS technology status and
risks:]{.mark}]{.underline} While current CCS policy offers early stage
financial support for research, development, and demonstration projects,
additional policies are needed to spur further development of integrated
projects at scale and create markets for CCS technology.

Simon, 2-21, Trumping Judicial Review, Washington Spectator,
https://washingtonspectator.org/trump-judicial-review-waxman/

The courts have not ruled on the merits and legality of the executive
order, so this churlish nod to judicial deference appears to be another
feint. What is clear is that judges are not just going to play along
with Trump's agenda. How many rebukes can he take? How long before he
devises his own plan to get his way? **[[Given Trump's character and
history]{.mark}, and given the hard-right boundary-pushing of this White
House, [there is good reason to expect]{.mark} that the [administration
will press, subvert, and ignore the Court as it deems
necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[daring the House to draw up
articles of impeachment]{.underline}**]{.mark} in order to maintain
checks and balances in Washington. **[Throughout his career in politics
and business, [Trump has shown that nothing short of coercive power will
contain him]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Traditions, truths, behavioral
norms, and moral warrants are irrelevant; all that matters is whether
adversaries can bring force to bear. He asks for neither permission nor
forgiveness.]{.underline}** Thus has Trump repeatedly avoided his civic
duty to pay taxes and bullied his way out of contracts. Where law is on
his side, he will always self-aggrandize, even if conventional notions
of the right or good demand otherwise. Where the law is against him, he
has relied on his money and lawyers to escape prosecution. If he cannot
do that, he at least avoids accepting responsibility for wrongs
committed and harms done. For instance, early in his career, when the
federal government sued his real estate firm for discriminating against
black renters, Trump settled without admitting guilt. And, as a series
of reports in The Washington Post by David Fahrenthold document, Trump
abused his charitable foundation for purposes of self-dealing and relied
on dodgy tax schemes to get away with it. During his presidential
campaign, Trump was endlessly chastised for ignoring all the usual
political norms. He has not released his tax returns, defending the
choice exclusively on the grounds that he isn't required to do so.
Similarly, he refuses to resolve his conflicts of interest, instead
doing the least the law requires while throwing a few small bones to a
public anxious about corruption. He repeatedly lied about the incidence
of crime and terrorism and has continued to do so in office. When
questioned on these and other fabrications, he and his adjuncts inflate
them. They are never chastened. His Department of Homeland Security
initially continued to carry out his executive orders on immigration and
refugees even after federal courts had stayed them, demonstrating the
administration's hostility even to judicial constraint. **[The point
here is not to recap but to recognize something that seems intrinsic to
Trump's character: [he is incapable of restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[He does what he wants and challenges others to hold him
accountable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This is a dangerous disposition
in a president. As a private citizen, Trump had to respect the law to
some degree, lest its coercive power get in his way. As president, he is
still enjoined to respect the law, but it is now his job to carry out
that law. This means that the credible threat of legal coercion is much
reduced]{.underline}**. **[[He can do as he wishes and refuse to execute
the law against himself]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He may not succeed, but
only if it is politically impossible. Surely this can't be, though. The
president, we are inclined to believe, is not above the law. Indeed, the
Constitution tells us as much. But this is just a fine phrase. **[The
president is only beholden to law if he believes he is or if someone can
force him to be]{.underline}**. For **[in our system the courts can only
speak; they cannot act. The courts, including [the Supreme
Court]{.mark}, [may tell the president he is wrong]{.mark} on the law,
[but the material force]{.mark} of the federal government [is]{.mark}
invested [in the executive.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The White House can
carry on as it pleases, limited only by the will of the voters exercised
every four years or by Congress, through the impeachment power. No less
a luminary than President Abraham **[Lincoln showed as much. In 1862 he
rejected the Supreme Court's ruling in Dred Scott v.
Sanford]{.underline}**, which held that Congress had no power to
regulate slavery in U.S. states and territories. Yet Congress voted that
year to prohibit slavery in all existing and future territories, and
Lincoln signed the law. In doing so, Lincoln arguably followed a bit of
wisdom offered by another American of high standing, Thomas Jefferson.
In 1810 Jefferson wrote, "A strict observance of the written laws is
doubtless one of the highest duties of a good citizen, but it is not the
highest. The laws of necessity, of self preservation, of saving the
country when in danger are of higher obligation." This is a stunning
argument for unconstrained executive authority in times of crisis. **[It
is not hard to envision Trump]{.underline}**, who is convinced that the
United States is in mortal peril from immigrants and terrorists,
**[acting on a similar sense of righteousness]{.underline}**. What is
more, when Lincoln rebuffed the Supreme Court, he may have been acting
on his constitutional authority. **[[We are used to thinking of the
Court as the final arbiter]{.mark} of what the law is and what the
Constitution allows. [But a vigorous strain of legal thought]{.mark},
mostly confined to conservative intellectuals, [holds that this
"judicial supremacy" is a myth]{.mark}---that [the Constitution nowhere
grants the Court power to review and nullify
laws]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On this reading, the Court appropriated
such power in the case of Marbury v. Madison (1803), and nearly everyone
has spent the past two hundred years deluding themselves. The legal
thinking behind this view is complex and certainly open to debate.
Indeed, it is a minority position primarily associated with unyielding
originalists, often aligned with the Federalist Society. What is more,
originalism cuts both ways here. For instance, the Georgetown Law
Professor Randy Barnett has defended judicial supremacy, which he also
calls "judicial equality," through close reading of the framers. He
contends that the "Judicial Power" in the Constitution, as the framers
understood it, encompasses authority to review and void unconstitutional
laws. (Why an originalist account should be necessary or itself
supreme---originalism and analogs being absent from the
Constitution---remains mysterious.) Whatever the arguments pro and con,
the Trump administration is an ideal vehicle for the conservative case
against judicial review. **[[Trump]{.mark} is surrounded by extreme
[political and policy entrepreneurs]{.mark} who [have]{.mark} already
[shown themselves willing to upset even the least controversial
expectations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Top adviser Steve Bannon has made
no secret of his intent to transform government at every level. Trump's
refusal to release his tax returns and place his assets in a blind trust
break decades of precedent. Since the first day of his campaign, he has
dispensed with half a century of carefully cultivated GOP dog-whistling
in favor of explicit racism. With respect to judicial review
specifically, policy chief Stephen **[[Miller]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
proclaimed the administration's disdain. During a recent appearance on
Face the Nation, he **[accurately noted that the president enjoys "very
substantial" power over national-security policy. But he [asserted new
legal doctrine in claiming that any]{.mark} such [policy "will not be
questioned]{.mark}]{.underline}**." He also said, "We have a judiciary
that has taken far too much power and become in many cases a supreme
branch of government." **[An [administration unconstrained by foresight,
facts, procedure, and morality, consumed by ideological zeal, is well
placed to challenge judicial review]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is, after
all, just a tradition, according to the sorts of constitutional
interpreters likely to be embraced in this Oval Office. And **[[even if
the courts do not acquiesce to such monumental revisionism]{.mark}, [the
administration is]{.mark} the entity [tasked with enforcing]{.mark}
court [decisions, which]{.mark} [means]{.mark} that [precious little can
stop it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The courts can still give the
administration much of what it wants without inviting challenges to
their powers of review. The Supreme Court conceded to Roosevelt while
preserving its authority. And many speculate that the justices played
along with the 2012 case against the Affordable Care Act because they
knew that, if they struck down the law's central provisions, the Obama
administration would find a way around them. **[Had Obama succeeded in
circumventing the court, he would have revealed the essential
powerlessness of a judiciary dependent on the executive's
will.]{.underline}** But do you expect the Trump administration to play
that card only once? Are men such as Trump and Bannon, demonstrably
ruthless in their pursuit of financial and political gain, to be trusted
with such powers of intimidation? At the moment, we can only wonder, but
what we know of them counsels severe doubt. **[We should consider both
of these real possibilities: that the administration will question the
authority of the judiciary to determine the legality of its actions and
that the administration, when rebuked, will refuse to comply with court
orders]{.underline}**. In either circumstance, **[[judges]{.mark}
themselves [present no obstacle to a defiant
executive]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[Only Congress, exercising
its power to impeach, and the voters, can slow the administration
down]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For opponents of judicial review, this is
precisely as it should be. **[[For anyone who values the courts as
effective sources of checks and balances, this is a troubling
moment.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

THE COURTS We now turn from Congress to the courts, the other main hope
of liberal legalism. **[In both economic and security crises, [courts
are marginal participants]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Here
two]{.underline}** Schmittian **[themes are relevant: that [courts come
too late to the crisis to make a real difference]{.mark} in many cases,
and that [courts have pragmatic and political incentives to defer to the
executive]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whatever the nominal standard of
review. **[The largest problem]{.underline}**, underlying these
mechanisms, **[is that courts possess legal authority but not robust
political legitimacy]{.underline}**. Legality and legitimacy diverge in
crisis conditions, and the divergence causes courts to assume a
restrained role. We take up these points in turn. The Timing of Review
**[A basic feature of judicial review]{.underline}** in most
Anglo-American legal systems **[is that [courts rely upon the initiative
of private parties to bring suits]{.mark}, which the courts then
adjudicate]{.underline}** as "cases and controversies" rather than as
abstract legal questions. **[[This means that there is always a time
lag]{.underline}]{.mark}**, of greater or lesser duration, **[between
the adoption of controversial government measures and the issuance of
judicial opinions on their legal validity]{.underline}**. Common lawyers
sometimes praise this delayed review precisely because the delay ensures
that courts are less likely to set precedents while crises are hot,
precedents that will be warped by the emotions of the day or by the
political power of aroused majorities. 70 **[[Delayed review has severe
costs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however. For one thing, **[[courts often
face a fait accompli]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although it is sometimes
possible to strangle new programs in the crib, **[once]{.underline}**
those **[measures are up and running, it is all the more difficult for
courts to order that they be abolished. This may be because new measures
create new constituencies or]{.underline}** otherwise **[entrench
themselves, creating a ratchet effect, but the simpler hypothesis is
just that officials and the public believe that the measures have worked
well enough]{.underline}**. Most simply, **[[returning to the
pre-emergency status quo by judicial order]{.mark} seems unthinkable;
doing so [would]{.mark} just re[-create the conditions]{.mark} that led
the legislature and executive to take emergency measures in the first
place]{.underline}**. For another thing, **[even if courts could
overturn or restrict emergency measures]{.underline}**, by the time
their review occurs, **[those measures will by their nature already have
worked, or not]{.underline}**. If they have worked, or at least if there
is a widespread sense that the crisis has passed, then the legislators
and public may not much care whether the courts invalidate the emergency
measures after the fact. By the time the courts issue a final
pronouncement on any constitutional challenges to the EESA, the program
will either have increased liquidity and stabilized financial markets,
or not. In either case, the **[legal [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**
will interest constitutional lawyers, but **[[will lack practical
significance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Intensity of Review Another
dimension of review is intensity rather than timing. At the level of
constitutional law, **[the overall record is that courts tend to defer
heavily to the executive]{.underline}** in times of crisis, only
reasserting themselves once the public sense of imminent threat has
passed. As we will discuss in chapter 3, federal courts deciding
administrative cases after 9/11 have tended to defer to the government's
assertion of security interests, although more large number work is
necessary to understand the precise contours of the phenomenon. Schmitt
occasionally argued that the administrative state would actually
increase the power of judges, insofar as liberal legislatures would
attempt to compensate for broad delegations to the executive by creating
broad rights of judicial review; consider the Administrative Procedure
Act (APA), which postdates Schmitt 's claim. It is entirely consistent
with the broader tenor of Schmitt 's thought, however, to observe that
the very political forces that constrain legislatures to enact broad
delegations in times of crisis also hamper judges, including judges
applying APA-style review. While their nominal power of review may be
vast, the judges cannot exercise it to the full in times of crisis.
Legality and Legitimacy At a higher level of abstraction,
**[[the]{.mark} basic problem [underlying judicial
review]{.mark}]{.underline}** of emergency measures **[[is the
divergence between the courts' legal powers and their political
legitimacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** in times of perceived crisis. As
Schmitt pointed out, emergency measures can be "exceptional" in the
sense that although illegal, or of dubious legality, they may
nonetheless be politically legitimate, if they respond to the public's
sense of the necessities of the situation. 71 Domesticating this point
and applying it to the practical operation of the administrative state,
**[[courts]{.underline}]{.mark}** reviewing emergency measures may be on
strong legal ground, but will tend to **[[lack]{.mark} the politi[cal
legitimacy needed to invalidate emergency legislation or the executive's
emergency regulations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Anticipating
this, courts pull in their horns. When the public sense of crisis
passes, legality and legitimacy will once again pull in tandem; courts
then have more freedom to invalidate emergency measures, but it is less
important whether or not they do so, as the emergency measure will in
large part have already worked, or not. The precedents set after the
sense of crisis has passed may be calmer and more deliberative, and thus
of higher epistemic quality---this is the claim of the common lawyers,
which resembles an application of the Madisonian vision to the
courts---but **[[the public will not take]{.mark} much [notice]{.mark}
of those precedents, [and]{.mark} they [will]{.mark} [have little
sticking power]{.mark} when the next crisis rolls around.]{.underline}**

## Case

### CCS

#### CCS increases energy needs and pollution 

**[Jacobson 6/19]{.underline}** Mark Z. Jacobson, 06-26-2019, a
professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University
and director of its Atmosphere/Energy Program, \"100% Clean, Renewable
Energy and Storage for Everything," Stanford University,
https://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/WWSBook/WWSBook.html SL

SDA**[CCS]{.underline}**/U does none of that. Its sole benefit is to
remove CO2 from the air. To do that, it **[costs more
than]{.underline}**

**[renewable energy.]{.underline}** In fact, SDACCS/U is basically just
a cost added onto the cost of using fossil fuels.

Moreover, SDACCS/U is **[a severe opportunity cost.]{.underline}**
Because SDACCS/U **[removes no health-affecting air]{.underline}**

**[pollutants from the air; money spent on it takes funding away from
the purchase of clean, renewable WWS]{.underline}**

**[technologies that do replace fossil fuel power plants or vehicles and
eliminate their health-affecting emissions and]{.underline}**

**[associated health costs.]{.underline}**

Second, SDACCS/U **[requires substantial electricity and heat to work,
and this must come from]{.underline}** the grid, **[a]{.underline}**

**[dedicated fossil fuel source]{.underline}**, or a dedicated WWS
source. If grid electricity is used, **[air pollution emissions
directly]{.underline}**

**[increase compared with no]{.underline}** SDA**[CCS]{.underline}**/U
and **[a portion of the CO2 emissions reduced by]{.underline}**
SDA**[CCS]{.underline}**/U **[are reemitted]{.underline}**

**[to the air due to the use of grid electricity.]{.underline}**

Third, because SDA**[CCS]{.underline}**/U **[increases or prevents the
reduction of grid electricity use, it extends the life of
fossil]{.underline}**

**[fuel and nuclear power plants and the upstream mining, transport, and
processing of fossil fuels and the resulting]{.underline}**

**[emissions associated with them. It similarly increases the energy
insecurity and environmental and health]{.underline}**

**[consequences of the fossil fuel and nuclear infrastructures,
including the yearly increase in land degradation due to]{.underline}**

**[these industries.]{.underline}**

Fourth, the higher cost of SDACCS/U relative to WWS electric power
technologies ensures that a fixed amount of

capital spent on SDACCS/U increases CO2 and air pollution more than if
the same money were spent on WWS

technologies.

Even if the cost per unit mass of CO2 removed by SDACCS/U were the same
as or lower than that of WWS,

SDACCS/U would still increase CO2 and air pollution relative to WWS
because of (a) the need for SDACCS/U to

use electricity and (b) the fact that SDACCS/U does not reduce any air
pollutants, whereas all WWS technologies

do. **[Because]{.underline}** SDA**[CCS]{.underline}**/U **[needs
electricity, it either increases CO2 from the background grid directly
or increases it]{.underline}**

**[indirectly by requiring a dedicated]{.underline}** WWS or **[fossil
fuel source to provide that electricity]{.underline}**, preventing that
WWS

electricity from displacing coal. Either way, SDACCS/U results in more
CO2 than WWS.

In terms of cost, one final factor is social cost, discussed in more
detail in Chapter 7. The social cost of air

pollution is the health-related cost of air pollution to society. For
example, air pollution increases death and

illness, both of which increase hospitalization stays, emergency room
visits, lost work days, lost school days,

insurance rates, taxes, workman's compensation rates, and loss of
companionship, among other costs. A

worldwide mean health cost of fossil-fuel energy among all energy
sectors is about \$180 per MWh of energy

produced but varying by country (Table 7.11). The cost of a new wind
turbine is about \$43 (29 to 56) per MWh of

electricity produced (Lazard, 2018). This is less than the health cost
that the wind turbine eliminates (a mean of

\$180 per MWh worldwide). Thus, a new wind turbine displacing a fossil
fuel power plant immediately reduces

society's direct energy cost plus health cost. In other words, every
wind turbine installed avoids a high cost to

society. On the other hand, SDA**[CCS]{.underline}**/U **[does not
reduce any air pollution.]{.underline}** SDACCS/U **[allows air
pollution and its]{.underline}**

**[costs to persist.]{.underline}** So, **[a wind turbine resplacing a
fossil plant will always provide much more benefit than
the]{.underline}**

**[same money spent on]{.underline}** SDA**[CCS]{.underline}**/U
**[equipment.]{.underline}**

#### No investment- the Trump EPA ended support for CCS

**[Siegel 6/22]{.underline}** Josh Siegel, 6-22-2019, \"Trump EPA snubs
carbon capture, an emissions reduction technique favored by
environmentalists and Republicans\", Washington Examiner,
https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/trump-epa-snubs-carbon-capture-an-emissions-reduction-technique-favored-by-environmentalists-and-republicans
SL

**[The Trump Environmental Protection Agency is dismissing a
technology]{.underline}** that is favored by many Republicans and is
widely considered to be among the most effective at slashing emissions
from coal plants.

**[EPA's Affordable Clean Energy, or ACE, rule, finalized last week to
replace President Barack Obama\'s signature climate change rule, the
Clean Power Plan, does not include carbon capture and storage, also
known as CCS]{.underline}**, in a list of six technologies that
utilities can consider to reduce carbon emissions and make their plants
more efficient by burning less coal to produce the same amount of
electricity.

**[The snub of carbon capture, critics say, shows the agency is not
serious about combating climate change.]{.underline}**

**[\"Based on the rejection of CCS, it\'s hard to conclude the EPA
leadership takes the job of regulating carbon pollution
seriously,"]{.underline}** said Julio Friedmann, a researcher who
studies carbon capture at the Center for Global Energy Policy at
Columbia University. Friedmann was formerly principal deputy assistant
of the Energy Department's Office of Fossil Energy in the Obama
administration.

Carbon capture technology removes carbon dioxide from a power plant\'s
exhaust, so as to not release it into the atmosphere, and traps the
emissions underground.

**[The EPA argues carbon capture has not been "adequately
demonstrated"]{.underline}** on a commercial scale **[and is too
expensive.]{.underline}**

"Our view of the law is that when states develop emissions limits, it
cannot be based on carbon capture," an EPA senior official told
reporters on a press call this week.

To be sure, **[carbon capture is not considered very energy efficient.
It requires a chunk of the energy produced by the power plant to run the
capture and storage process. So to include carbon capture as part of a
rule that aims to bolster coal plant efficiency doesn\'t make
sense.]{.underline}**

#### CCS can't solve warming- earthquakes leak stored CO2

**[Mcclure 12]{.underline}** Max Mcclure, 6-19-2012, cites Stanford
researchers, \"Carbon capture and storage likely to cause earthquakes,
say Stanford researchers\", Stanford University,
https://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/june/carbon-capture-earthquakes-061912.html
SL

But **[to significantly reduce emissions, CCS would need to operate on a
massive scale, potentially sequestering upwards of 3.5 billion metric
tons of CO2 each year. A new technical hurdle may mean CCS won\'t be
able to get anywhere near that volume.]{.underline}**

In a paper appearing in the journal PNAS, Stanford geophysics Professor
Mark Zoback and environmental Earth science Professor Steven Gorelick
argue that, in many areas, **[carbon sequestration is likely to create
pressure build-up large enough to break the reservoirs\' seals,
releasing the stored CO2.]{.underline}**

**[\"Almost all of our current climate mitigation models assume CCS is
going to be one of the primary tools we use,\" said Zoback. \"What
we\'re saying is, not so fast.\"]{.underline}**

**[Induced seismicity]{.underline}**

Intraplate earthquakes -- **[earthquakes]{.underline}** that occur far
from the boundaries between tectonic plates -- **[can occur nearly
anywhere in continental interiors]{.underline}**, due to what the
researchers describe as \"the critically stressed nature of the Earth\'s
crust.\" **[Small pressure build-ups near potential faults reduce
friction, increasing the likelihood of a fault slip.]{.underline}**

It\'s been known for a half-century that human activities can increase
pressure to the point of inducing small temblors. In the 1960s, the
injection of wastewater into a well near Denver triggered a series of
small earthquakes. Last year, similar quakes were induced in Arkansas,
Ohio and on the border of Colorado and New Mexico.

Reviewing field stress measurements and laboratory studies of shear
displacements, Zoback and Gorelick say **[injection of massive
quantities of CO2 would be likely to produce the same
result.]{.underline}**

Zoback has previously described wastewater-induced quakes as manageable,
low-risk events. Carbon injection is unlikely to trigger large,
destructive earthquakes, the professors argue, but \"the implications
are different if you\'re trying to store carbon for thousands of
years.\" Zoback said.

Zoback and Gorelick state that **[even a fault slip of a few centimeters
could allow stored CO2 to reach the surface]{.underline}** -- a serious
concern, since the researchers argue that **[carbon repositories need a
leak rate of less than 1 percent every thousand years to be
effective.]{.underline}**

\"The bar is much higher in this case,\" Zoback said.

Where to put it

The areas where CCS is already practiced successfully follow a very
specific geologic profile. Ideally, the reservoirs themselves are formed
from porous, weakly cemented materials that slow pressure build-up, but
are isolated from the surface by an impermeable rock layer.

The North Sea\'s Sleipner gas field, for example, makes use of the
Utsira formation -- a porous sandstone structure under impermeable
shale.

**[It\'s an open question as to whether there are enough low-risk
geologic formations to engage in CCS at the necessary
level.]{.underline}**

The authors say that approximately 3,500 Utsiras would be necessary to
contribute significantly to reductions. But some scientists say fewer
would suffice.

\"Of course, you need to pick sites carefully,\" said Sally Benson,
Stanford professor of energy resources engineering and director of
Stanford\'s Global Climate and Energy Project. \"But finding these kinds
of locations does not seem infeasible.\"

She argues that only 600 such sites would be necessary, and that
existing formations in Texas and the Gulf Coast, the Middle East, the
North Sea and Western Australia provide promising sequestration
reservoirs. Pressure build-up in other areas can also be managed, she
says, by controlling injection rates and well design.

Zoback says there will continue to be a use for CCS at a small scale, in
regions that are near both CO2-producing plants and ideal geologic
formations.

**[\"But for the U.S. and the world to be considering CCS one of the
potential solutions to the greenhouse gas problem -- it\'s a very high
risk endeavor,\"]{.underline}** he said. **[\"We need options that are
practical, don\'t cost literally trillions of dollars and aren\'t
vulnerable to moderate size earthquakes.\"]{.underline}**

#### CCS fails- earthquakes undermine CCS efforts

**[Hecht 12]{.underline}** Jeff Hecht, 6-20-2012, \"Earthquake risk for
carbon capture and storage schemes\", New Scientist,
https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21954-earthquake-risk-for-carbon-capture-and-storage-schemes/
SL

Move over fracking: carbon capture and storage schemes (CCS) are more
likely to trigger earthquakes, warns the US National Research Council
(NRC). Meanwhile, **[a]{.underline}** separate **[study warns that
quake-fractured rocks could undermine CCS efforts by allowing the
trapped gas to leak back into the atmosphere.]{.underline}**

Carbon sequestration involves pumping CO2 at high pressure below ground
and trapping it in porous rocks at depths of 1 to 4 kilometres. Similar
deep injection wells are used to dispose of waste water, but despite the
large number of such wells, "very few \[seismic\] events have been
documented over the past several decades", writes an NRC panel in a new
report, Induced Seismicity Potential in Energy Technologies.

However, **[carbon capture and storage could see billions of cubic
metres of fluid injected below ground -- potentially enough to trigger
more and larger quakes]{.underline}**, the report concludes.

**[Even if those quakes do not damage property or put lives at risk,
they could undermine carbon capture schemes]{.underline}**, says Mark
Zoback, a geophysicist at Stanford University in California. "**[If you
trigger an earthquake, you are threatening the seal of the repository,"
he says. "CO2 is buoyant and it wants to rise and get
out."]{.underline}**

**[Although it is possible to find good sites to store CO2 where its
added pressure would be unlikely to cause quakes or leaks, too few are
available to handle the required volume]{.underline}**, Zoback says.
**[Older sedimentary rocks in the central US, where most power plants
are located, are brittle and so are more likely to fracture and leak.
Large-scale carbon capture and storage "is a risky, and likely
unsuccessful, strategy" for controlling greenhouse
warming]{.underline}**, Zoback says. He presented his concerns yesterday
to the Senate Energy Committee.

#### CCS increases emissions

**[EEA 11]{.underline}** European Environmental Agency, 11-17-2011,
\"Carbon capture and storage could also impact air pollution\", European
Environment Agency,
https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/carbon-capture-and-storage-could SL

What does CCS mean for air pollutants?

**[CCS technologies require approximately 15 -- 25 % more energy
depending on the particular type of technology used, so plants with CCS
need more fuel than conventional plants. This in turn can lead to
increased \'direct emissions\' occurring from facilities where CCS is
installed, and increased \'indirect emissions\' caused by the extraction
and transport of the additional fuel.]{.underline}**

The EEA report identifies some of the potential benefits and trade-offs
for the main air pollutants. It also presents a life-cycle case study
for 2050 considering three different scenarios, showing the potential
impacts on emissions of air pollutants if CCS were widely implemented in
Europe. Key findings include:

Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from power plants are predicted to fall
when carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured, as SO2 must also be removed after
the fuel combustion stage for technical reasons. Although the extraction
and transportation of additional coal will lead to higher SO2 emissions
from these stages of the CCS life-cycle, SO2 emissions should decrease
overall.

Particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are expected
to increase in line with the amount of the additional fuel consumed if
no additional measures to reduce emissions are installed.

**[Ammonia (NH3) is the only pollutant for which a significant increase
in emissions is expected to occur, with emissions potentially increasing
by a factor of 3 or more.]{.underline}** The foreseen increase is due to
the degradation of the amine-based solvents used to capture the CO2.
However, in absolute terms the increase is small compared to existing
ammonia emissions in Europe, 94% of which comes from agriculture.
Ammonia contributes to acidification and eutrophication of the
environment and also can form harmful fine particulate matter when
released in the atmosphere.

Potential carbon dioxide (CO2) savings from CCS vary greatly across the
three scenarios in the report. Emissions of CO2 in the EU would fall by
around 60 % by 2050 if CCS were implemented at all coal-based power
generation plants. Implementing CCS at all coal, gas and biomass plants
would result in net negative emissions -- in effect removing CO2 from
the atmosphere. This assumes that all biomass is harvested sustainably
without any net changes to the carbon stock.

The case study also shows clearly that the extraction and transport of
additional coal can contribute significantly to the life-cycle emissions
for coal-based CO2 capture technologies. Overall, however, CCS is
considered to be generally beneficial both in terms of climate change
and air pollution. However, the potential increase in certain pollutants
such as NH3, NOx and PM is important.

#### CCS is not sustainable- more than twice as expensive as renewables

**[Rissman and Orvis 17]{.underline}** Jeffrey Rissman and Robbie Orvis,
05-03-2017, Energy Innovation\'s Head of Modeling & Energy Policy Expert
\"Carbon Capture And Storage: An Expensive Option For Reducing U.S. CO2
Emissions\", Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2017/05/03/carbon-capture-and-storage-an-expensive-option-for-reducing-u-s-co2-emissions/
SL

The largest problem facing CCS today is cost. **[In addition to the
costs of an ordinary coal-fired power plant (which in the U.S. is
already quite high, about \$92 per megawatt-hour \[MWh\]), a coal plant
with CCS requires additional equipment, increasing upfront construction
costs, and has additional operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses.
Since a considerable amount of energy is required to extract, pump, and
compress CO2, a plant with CCS must also purchase and burn more fuel to
produce the same amount of electricity as a plant without CCS.
Additional costs come from building pipelines to transport the CO2,
injecting it underground, and monitoring the injection
site.]{.underline}**

Comparing The Costs: Coal, CCS, Wind And Solar

We analyzed the cost of electricity for four types of power plants built
in the U.S. in 2017: ultrasupercritical (modern) coal units, coal units
that capture and store 90% of their CO2 emissions, onshore wind power,
and utility-scale solar PV. We included capital, fuel, and O&M costs;
the efficiencies (heat rates) of the coal plants, the plants' capacity
factors (what portion of the year they may generate power), fuel prices,
construction time, financing costs (including inflation and interest
rates), and depreciation. In the case of coal with CCS, we included the
costs of CO2 transportation (assuming a 500 kilometer pipeline) and
injection, as well as long-term monitoring. Government subsidies are not
included for any of the technologies. Our full data sources (primarily
the U.S. EIA and National Renewable Energy Laboratory), assumptions, and
calculations are available online to download.

![Levelized generation costs of coal, coal with CCS, onshore wind and
solar PV plants.](media/image1.png){width="7.1560684601924756in"
height="2.13042104111986in"}

**[Even without CCS, a new coal plant in the U.S. costs more than
onshore wind and solar PV per unit of electricity it generates. Coal
plants that capture and store 90% of their carbon emissions cost nearly
two-thirds more than an equivalent coal plant without CCS to produce the
same amount of electricity. A new solar PV or wind plant is between half
and a third the price of a new coal unit with CCS and emits zero CO2. As
a source of low-carbon power, CCS can't compete on economics with wind
and solar.]{.underline}**

Will CCS Be Competitive In The Future?

CCS is a new technology, and costs tend to fall as new technologies are
deployed and develop. Could CCS become cost-competitive with onshore
wind and solar PV thanks to research progress?

The answer is no -- the laws of physics limit CCS' improvement
potential. Extra energy is required to extract, compress, and pump the
CO2. **[No matter how efficient CCS equipment becomes, it can never
eliminate the need for extra energy to do extra work. Similarly, no
matter how cheap CCS equipment becomes, it will never be free. CCS
plants will always be more expensive to operate than regular coal
plants, which are themselves more expensive than wind and
solar.]{.underline}**

The price in the table above assumes that CCS plants will come in at
forecasted costs, but CCS projects have so far been vastly over budget.
For example, **[Southern Company's Kemper plant was originally forecast
to cost \$2.2 billion, but it is still incomplete after three years of
delays and now has an estimated price tag of \$7.3 billion. The Illinois
FutureGen project, despite receiving \$200 million in subsidies, was
ultimately scrapped due to cost and technology concerns.]{.underline}**

Apart from CCS, coal power is a mature technology, and the costs of coal
plants are not declining much in response to research. In contrast,
**[solar PV and wind are already cheaper than new coal, and more cost
declines are expected in the coming decade or so, as the technologies
continue to mature.]{.underline}** In the long term, even **[coal
without CCS is unlikely to compete economically with wind and solar; it
is extremely unlikely that coal with CCS will ever do so.]{.underline}**

Some have proposed subsidizing CCS to help overcome its high costs.
However, the **[subsidies required to put CCS on equal footing with wind
or solar are staggering. Bringing CCS costs in line with solar costs
today would require a roughly \$80 per MWh subsidy, assuming CCS
projects stay on-budget.]{.underline}**

By comparison, the production tax credit for wind plants, which passed
on a bipartisan basis in 2015, provides a subsidy of \$23 per MWh and
will sunset completely in 2020. The investment tax credit for solar
plants pays for up to 30% of investment costs, or about \$18 per MWh,
and will decrease to 10% of investment costs by 2022.

### WTO

#### Doha failure means the WTO is *[structurally doomed]{.underline}* -- collapse of multilateral trade negotiations means preferential trade agreements *[take precedence]{.underline}* over global multilateral trading rules -- that makes *[trade conflict]{.underline}* and *[loss of WTO legitimacy]{.underline}* structurally inevitable

**[Bhagwati 12]{.underline}**

(Jadish Bhagwati, University Professor of Law and Economics at Columbia
University and Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, "The
Broken Legs of Global Trade," May 29, 2012,
https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-broken-legs-of-global-trade)

NEW YORK -- The **[Doha Round, the latest phase of multilateral trade
negotiations, failed in November 2011, after ten years of talks, despite
official efforts by many countries, including the United Kingdom and
Germany, and by nearly all eminent trade scholars today]{.underline}**.
While trade officials in the United States and the European Union blamed
the G-22 developing countries' excessive demands for the failure of
earlier negotiations in Cancún in 2003, there is general agreement that
this time it was the US whose unwarranted (and unyielding) demands
killed the talks. So, now what?

**[The failure to achieve multilateral trade liberalization by
concluding the Doha Round means that the world lost the gains from trade
that a successful treaty would have brought.]{.underline}** But that is
hardly the end of the matter: **[the failure of Doha will virtually halt
multilateral trade liberalization for years to come.]{.underline}**

Of course, **[multilateral trade negotiations are only one of three legs
on which the World Trade Organization stands. But breaking that leg
adversely affects the functioning of the other two: the WTO's
rule-making authority and its dispute-settlement mechanism. The costs
here may also be large.]{.underline}**

Until now, preferential trade agreements (PTAs) among small groups of
countries co-existed with multilateral, non-discriminatory
trade-liberalization rounds. **[As a result, the rules that govern
trade, such as anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties to offset
illegal subsidies, were in the domain of both the WTO and the
PTAs.]{.underline}** But, when there was a conflict**[, WTO rules
prevailed, because they conferred enforceable rights that extended to
all WTO members, whereas PTA-defined rights extended only to the PTA's
few members]{.underline}**.

So, while powerful, "**[hegemonic" countries like the US managed to
impose their own rules on weaker partners in the PTAs that they helped
to proliferate, big emerging economies like India, Brazil, China, and
South Africa insisted on rejecting such demands when made as part of
multilateral trade rounds like Doha.]{.underline}**

Now, however, with the era of multilateral trade rounds and system-wide
rules behind us, the PTAs are the only game in town, and the templates
established by the hegemonic powers in unequal trade treaties with
economically weaker countries will increasingly carry the day. In fact,
such templates now extend beyond conventional trade issues (for example,
agricultural protection) to vast numbers of areas unrelated to trade,
including labor standards, environmental rules, policies on
expropriation, and the ability to impose capital-account controls in
financial crises.

**[The US-led public-relations blitzkrieg of euphemism has already
begun, with US Assistant Trade Representative Wendy Cutler describing
the latest PTA, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as a "high standard"
agreement.]{.underline}** Other American officials have taken to calling
PTA's "trade agreements for the twenty-first century." Who could
possibly be against the twenty-first century?

What is disturbing is the way in which some trade economists in Geneva
and in Washington have capitulated to such propaganda, and regard
capitulation by the WTO as a way to "salvage" and reshape the
organization. **[The WTO, like a village during the Vietnam War, must be
destroyed in order to be saved.]{.underline}**

Unfortunately, this insidious attack on the second leg of the WTO also
extends to the third leg, the dispute-settlement mechanism**[. The DSM
is the pride of the WTO: it is the only impartial and binding mechanism
for adjudicating and enforcing contractual obligations defined by the
WTO and accepted by its members]{.underline}**. It gives every member,
big or small, a platform and a voice.

Once PTA-based DSMs are established, however, **[adjudication of
disputes will reflect asymmetries of power, benefiting the stronger
trade partner.]{.underline}** Moreover, **[third countries will have
little scope for input into PTA-based DSMs, though their interests may
very well be affected by how adjudication is structured.]{.underline}**

Given that **[the US has abandoned any pretense of leadership on world
trade, it is up to major emerging economies and like-minded developed
countries to establish their own template, one that adheres to trade
objectives and discards what special-interest lobbies in hegemons like
the US seek to foist on PTAs.]{.underline}** This is exactly what India
has done with the EU, which is now stripping such features out of its
proposed PTA.

**[Other countries -- Brazil, South Africa, and China among the major
emerging economies, and Japan and Australia among the developed
countries -- should back such "garbage-free" PTAs as
well]{.underline}**. That just might be an adequate rebuff to the rise
of PTAs whose main objective is to serve hegemonic interests alone --
perhaps even sufficient to get the multilateral approach back on track.

#### The WTO trading system is bad -- facilitates *[Chinese protectionism]{.underline}*, *[overconsumption]{.underline}*, and *[right-wing populist nationalism]{.underline}* -- their evidence ignores structural transformation of trade caused by *[Chinese accession to the WTO]{.underline}* and *[increasing transferability of absolute advantage]{.underline}*

**[Autry 18]{.underline}**

Marshall, "Is the global trade system broken?," May 7^th^, 2018, *The
Economist*,
https://debates.economist.com/debate/global-trade-system-broken?state=opening#pro_statement)

**[The global trading system is broken and the free-trade paradigm upon
which it is based has become a choice target for populist politicians in
many Western democracies.]{.underline}** The system was pitched by
post-war economists as a scientifically based replacement for the chaos
and inefficiency of parochial bilateral trade agreements. **[The new
multilateral system promised to harness the power of Ricardian
comparative advantage to produce greater abundance for all, while
ensuring an equitable distribution of wealth]{.underline}**.

The **[initial results were promising. Despite protests from leftist
labour unions and environmentalists, the 1990s and early 2000s saw
strong economic growth and falling consumer prices in many
countries]{.underline}**. China's admission into the WTO in 2001 was a
capstone for the new system. Economists, industry leaders, politicians
and pundits declared victory.

I too was a free trader, until I looked closely into the US-China trade
relationship, the most important axis for the global trade system. What
I heard from both Chinese and American business owners and workers was
concerning. **[The Chinese government was buttressing their
state-capitalist model with a mercantilist trade strategy that exploited
flaws in the comparative-advantage model.]{.underline}**

In David Ricardo's day, the early 1800s, **[the sources of absolute
advantage were non-transferable assets like Portugal's fine climate for
wine production.]{.underline}** However absolute **[advantages of our
era were built on R&D, university education and effective capital
markets, all of which could be transferred. China's leaders rigged
today's trade to compel the transfer of tomorrow's absolute advantages,
establishing their future monopoly positions. They developed the
"peaceful rise" marketing campaign designed to attract Western tech and
capital]{.underline}**.

Gaining access to the Chinese market became a corporate necessity.
Investors pressured CEOs to enter ill-conceived joint partnerships,
transfer technologies to Chinese competitors and ignore industrial
espionage. Despite pledges to the contrary, **[China, along with many
other developing countries, maintained high tariffs, export subsidies,
currency controls, and tax systems biased in favour of
exporters.]{.underline}**

These on-the-ground observations were reflected in trade statistics.
Deficits were persistent and growing. The classic economic
auto-correction systems, such as David Hume\'s currency adjustment
mechanism, failed to ameliorate the problem. In 1989 the American
trade-in-goods deficit of \$6bn with China was a manageable 0.11% of
American GDP. After 30 years of continuous growth, it is now \$375bn, a
leakage of nearly 2% of the entire American economy. **[The results of
trade agreements with South Korea and other nations have been similarly
lopsided and America's trade-in-goods deficit with the world is
approximately 4% of GDP.]{.underline}**

At the same time inequality has risen. According to the World Bank, the
Gini coefficient for China leapt from 0.29 in 1981 to 0.42 in 2012. (The
higher the number, the more economic inequality.) For America, this
measure of financial inequality rose from 0.35 in 1980 to 0.42 in 2016.

**[The system has also generated disturbing negative geopolitical and
environmental externalities. Rather than promoting liberalism, the
system has legitimised and empowered militant dictatorships in China and
Russia]{.underline}**. Rather than driving economic efficiencies, **[the
system encouraged overcapacity and overconsumption. Concrete and steel
are shipped in both directions through the Pacific's growing raft of
plastic consumer debris.]{.underline}**

Mainstream economists will argue that many developed nations run
surpluses in services, albeit nowhere near enough to balance the current
account. Sadly, service-sector jobs are generally poor substitutes for
manufacturing work. In 2017**[, some 57% of American service exports to
China were in tourism, an industry notorious for temporary jobs ands low
wages.]{.underline}**

**[Thirty years of growing imbalances, increasing inequality, and
environmental deterioration demand an honest re-evaluation. The rise of
populist political movements is sending a clear signal that the people
are ahead of their economic elites in recognising that the global trade
system is broken.]{.underline}**
