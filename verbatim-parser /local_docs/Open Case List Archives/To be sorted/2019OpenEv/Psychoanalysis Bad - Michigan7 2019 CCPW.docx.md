### Falsifiability

#### Psychoanalysis is based on fabricated evidences

Todd **Dufresne 6**, Professor of Philosophy and founding Director of
The Advanced Institute for Globalization & Culture at Lakehead
University, Killing Freud, googlebooks

TD: [I tried to make the heterogeneity of opinion about Freuds death
drive theory work on a few levels, one being a pointed criticism of the
arbitrary nature of criticism in the history of
psychoanalysis]{.underline}. In this respect the apparent dissensus
about the fundamentals of psychoanalysis is a scandal[. For this
dissensus implies that for over one hundred years smart people haven\'t
been able to derive any conclusions about Freuds so-called discoveries
--- **that the verdict is still out**]{.underline}. But that\'s untrue!
Informed critics know very well that Freud fabricated his findings and
was motivated by factors other than science and objectivity. So why do
so few people know, or care to know, about these sometimes stunning
facts? In no small measure, and as you were just hinting, the pundits
and critics themselves are to blame[. In Tales I tried to expose the
irreconcilable absurdity of Freud commentary over the last hundred
years, from Reich and Marcuse to Lacan and Derrida. It's obviously not
the case that these people are ignorant]{.underline}. It is rather the
case that these critics, like Freud before them, are motivated by
special interests; for example, by Marxist, structuralist, or
posr-structuralist interests[. And because their works are dogmatically
blind \[ignorant\] to intractable problems in Freuds work, including
basic facts, they have the effect of blinding nearly everyone who reads
them. We love to be dazzled, even by the spectacle of crushed glass. AG:
But what is a \'basic feet\', and who is in a position to know one when
he or she sees one? Isn\'t this where the post-modernist appreciation of
Freud comes in?]{.underline} TD: That\'s a lot of questions to answer
all at once! First of all, yes, the posties\' - post-modernists and
post-structuralists - have generally embraced the idea that history is
just a kind of fiction[. I am sympathetic to this idea and am willing to
entertain it up to a point. I have written about fiction and history in
psychoanalysis precisely because, given the pre-eminent role of fantasy
in the field]{.underline}, one has a tough time distinguishing between
fact and fiction, history and case study. I think this is an interesting
and amusing state of affairs, and have even written a short story that
is meant as a sendup of the kind of historical work that we all read.
But 1 attempt this work in an ironical spirit, believing that there are
indeed facts --- even if psychoanalysis has made it seem near impossible
for us to know them. [This, then, is a problem for psychoanalysis - but
not really for me. Naturally, though, I do worry about being too
cavalier about facts in history]{.underline}. Is it really the case that
the opinion of, say, a Holocaust denier is equal to another who believes
that three million Jews, rather than six million, were killed in
concentration camps? One says it didn\'t happen at all, while another
questions the interpretation of facts. [I reject the idea that truth is
relative at the level of basic facts, and to this extent echo something
Borch-Jacobsen once said4]{.underline}54: namely, any relativist who
ignores the facts risks becoming a dogmatist. And he\'s right. So when
posties say, for example, that the fabricated foundations of
psychoanalysis don\'t matter - primarily, they claim, because
psychoanalysis is only interested in fantasy they are being absurd
dogmatists. [But this response is still not very satisfactory, since it
doesn\'t address your first two questions: namely, what is a basic fact,
and how can we purport to know one? I would suggest, loosely following
the historian R. G. Collingwood, that there are two kinds of history:
one that barely deserves the name as it was once practised long ago; and
modern history.]{.underline} The first is what Collingwood rightly calls
\'scissor and paste\' history, and is more or less concerned with
recording dates, names and events: for example, on the ides of March
Caesar crossed the Rubicon. The second is interpretive history, and is
concerned with the interpretation of dates, names and events: for
example, on the ides of March Caesar crossed the Rubicon because he was
a megalomaniac, or because he wanted to defeat his enemies, or because
he was a compulsive bed-wetter, and so on[. How does this distinction
between basic and interpretive history help us? Well, because the
majority of Freud scholarship is so obviously an interpretive
history]{.underline}. The posties know this better than anyone, and are
absolutely right to conclude that such interpretation, like analysis, is
interminable. We can engage in debate about motives forever. [However,
there is a fundamental problem here in the case of psychoanalysis. Why?
Because all historical interpretation, even the freewheeling
interpretive history of post-modernists, is based on the scissor and
paste\' history of mere dates, names and events]{.underline}. And this
is whaere the posties drop the ball. For almost all of the best
critiques of Freud made over the last thirty years --- the kind I
associate with the creation of Critical Freud Studies - have begun by
examining basic facts about dates, names and events. What these critics
have found is that the history of Freud interpretation is the history of
misinterpretation of a fundamental kind. [Namely, it is interpretation
of \'facts\' or \'events that never happened. For example, they have
found that Freud, during the period of \'discovery\' and subsequent
abandonment of the Seduction Theory, exaggerated his results and, when
necessary, simply made them up]{.underline}. AG: He said he crossed the
Rubicon when he didn\'t? TD: Worse. Not only didn\'t he cross the
Rubicon, to extend the analogy, but it turns out in this case that the
Rubicon itself doesn\'t exist! It\'s all a myth. And so, while the
posties inevitably berate Cioffi, Crews and others for their naive
belief in facts, they have simply fallen into the rabbit hole that Freud
dug for them. For his part, Borch-Jacobscn replies that it is really
these nay-savers who are being naive. I would only repeat my suspicion
that our gullible colleagues have risked their egos on baseless
interpretations that they are now incapable of retracting. Of course,
the stakes are now very high. For if the critics are right, then the
majority of Freud interpretation is utterly worthless. And it is
worthless in at least two ways: as history and as interpretation. At
best, these groundless interpretations are a kind of literary garbage
--- works of unwitting fiction along the lines of Medieval discussions
of angels/\" Sure these works tell us a lot about the beliefs of a
certain period, in this case the twentieth century, but they don\'t work
the way the authors intended them. For me, they are cautionary tales ---
what Lacan would call \'poubellications\', or published trash. AG: If
empiricism is just a theory, isn\'t a \'basic fact\' just an
interpretation among others? TD[: That is true and a little bit clever,
but a degree of certainty is all I am after. I\'m not saying that we
can\'t get our basic facts wrong, which we obviously do. It is rather
that we must be willing to revise our interpretations on the basis of
the basic facts]{.underline} we do have. [I don\'t blame Freud scholars
for making a mess of everything with their erroneous interpretations.
Freud misled everyone, beginning with himself and his closest
followers.]{.underline} **[Psychoanalysis is a con-game, after all. That
said, short of sticking our heads in the sand, we must confront the
basic facts and rewrite the history of psychoanalysis
anew.]{.underline}**

#### Not only is psychoanalysis non-falsifiable, it also encourages tautology and hinders progressive thinking

**Samuels 93**---Training Analyst -- Society of Analytical Psychology
and Science Associate -- American Academy of Psychoanalysis (Andrew,
Free Associations, "The mirror and the hammer: depth psychology and
political transformation", Vol. 3D, Psychoanalytic Electronic
Publishing)

[The paper is about the depth psychology of political processes,
focusing on processes of political change]{.underline}. It is a
contribution to the longstanding ambition of depth psychology to develop
a form of political and cultural analysis that will, in Freud\'s words,
\'under-stand the riddles of the world\'. It has to be admitted that
there is an equally longstanding reluctance in the non-psychological
commun¬ity to accept the many and varied ideas and suggestions
concerning political matters that have been offered by analysts of all
persua¬sions. [I do not believe this can all be put down to resistance.
There is something offensive above reductive interpretations of complex
socio-political problems in exclusively psychological terms. The
tendency to panpsychism on the part of some depth psychologists has led
me to wonder if an adequate methodology and ethos actually exists with
which to make an engagement of depth psychology with the public sphere
possible.]{.underline}¶ By \'politics\' I mean the arrangements within a
culture for the organization and distribution of power, especially
economic power, and the way in which power is deployed to maintain the
survival and enhance the quality of human life. [Economic and political
power includes control of processes of information and representation as
well as the use of physical force and possession of vital resources such
as land, food and water. On a more personal level, political power
reflects the ability to choose freely whether to act and what action to
take in a given situation. \'Politics\' refers to the interplay between
the personal and public dimensions of power.]{.underline} That is, there
is an articulation between public, economic power and power as expressed
on the personal, private level. This articulation is demonstrated in
family organization, gender and race relations, and in religious and
artistic assumptions as they affect the life of individuals. (I have
also tried to be consistent in my use of the terms \'culture\',
\'society\' and \'collective\'.)\'¶ Here is an example of the difficulty
with psychological reductionism to which I am referring. At a conference
1 attended in London in 1990, a distinguished psychoanalyst referred to
the revolutionary students in Paris in 1968 as \'functioning as a
regressive group\'. Now, for a large group of students to be said to
regress, there must be, in the speaker\'s mind, some sort of normative
developmental starting point for them to regress to. The social group is
supposed to have a babyhood, as it were. Similarly, the speaker must
have had in mind the possibility of a healthier, progressive group
process --- what a more mature group of revolutionary students would
have looked like. [But complex social and political phenomena do not
conform to the individualistic, chronological, moralistic, pathologizing
framework that is often imported.¶ The problem stems from treating the
entire culture, or large chunks of it, as if it were an individual or,
worse, as if it were a baby.]{.underline} [Psychoanalysts project a
version of personality development couched in judgemental terms onto a
collective cultural and political process. If we look in this manner for
pathology in the culture, we will surely find it. As we are looking with
a psychological theory in mind, then, lo and behold, the theory will
explain the pathology, but this is a retrospective prophecy (to use a
phrase of Freud\'s), twenty-twenty hindsight. In this psychoanalytic
tautologizing there is really nothing much to get excited about. Too
much psychological writing on the culture, my own included, has suffered
from this kind of smug \'correctness\' when the \'material\' proves the
theoretical point.]{.underline} Of course it does! If we are interested
in envy or greed, then we will find envy or greed in capitalistic
organization. If we set out to demonstrate the presence of archetypal
patterns, such as projection of the shadow, in geopolitical relations,
then, without a doubt, they will seem to leap out at us. We influence
what we analyse and so psychological reflection on culture and politics
needs to be muted- there is not so much \'aha!\' as one hoped.

#### Psychoanalysis is a bunk science not to the standards of scientific models and falsifiability

Janet D. **Stemwedel**, 10-4-20**11**, \"Drawing the line between
science and pseudo-science.,\" Scientific American Blog Network,
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/doing-good-science/drawing-the-line-between-science-and-pseudo-science/

[Drawing the line between science and pseudo-science.]{.underline}
Recently, [we\'ve been discussing [strategies for distinguishing sound
science from attractively packaged
snake-oil](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/doing-good-science/2011/09/30/evaluating-scientific-claims-or-do-we-have-to-take-the-scientists-word-for-it/)]{.underline}.
It\'s worth noting that a fair number of scientists (and of
non-scientists who are reasonably science-literate) are of the view that
this is not a hard call to make \-- that astrology, alternative
therapies, ESP, and the other usual suspects fall on the wrong side of
some bright line that divides what is scientific from what is not \--
the clear line of demarcation that (scientists seem to assume) [Karl
Popper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_popper) pointed out years ago,
and that keeps the borders of science secure.  [While I think a fair
amount of non-science is so far from the presumptive border that we are
well within our rights to just point at it and laugh, as a philosopher
of science I need to go on the record as saying that right at the
boundary]{.underline}, things are not so sharp. But before we get into
how real science (and real non-science) might depart from Sir Karl\'s
image of things, I think it\'s important to look more closely at the
distinction he\'s trying to draw.  A central part of Karl Popper\'s
project is figuring out how to draw the line between science and
pseudo-science. He could have pitched this as figuring out how to draw
the line between science and non-science (which seems like less a term
of abuse than \"pseudo-science\"). [Why set the project up this way?
Partly, I think, he wanted to compare science to
non-science-that-looks-a-lot-like-science (]{.underline}in other words,
pseudo-science) so that he could work out precisely what is missing from
the latter[. He doesn\'t think we should dismiss pseudo-science as
utterly useless, uninteresting, or false. It\'s just not science.
Advertisement Of course, Popper wouldn\'t be going to the trouble of
trying to spell out what separates science from non-science if he
didn\'t think there was something special on the science side of the
line]{.underline}. He seems committed to the idea that scientific
methodology is well-suited \-- perhaps uniquely so \-- [for building
reliable knowledge and for avoiding false beliefs. Indeed, under the
assumption that science has this kind of power, one of the problems with
pseudo-science is that it gets an unfair credibility boost by so
cleverly mimicking the surface appearance of science.  ]{.underline}The
big difference Popper identifies between science and pseudo-science is a
difference in attitude. While a pseudo-science is set up to look for
evidence that supports its claims, Popper says, a science is set up to
challenge its claims and look for evidence that might prove it false. In
other words, pseudo-science seeks confirmations and science seeks
falsifications.  [There is a corresponding difference that Popper sees
in the form of the claims made by sciences and pseudo-sciences:
**Scientific claims are falsifiable \-- that is, they are claims where
you could set out what observable outcomes would be impossible if the
claim were true \--** while pseudo-scientific claims fit with any
imaginable set of observable outcomes]{.underline}. What this means is
that you could do a test that shows a scientific claim to be false, but
no conceivable test could show a pseudo-scientific claim to be false.
Sciences are testable, pseudo-sciences are not.  [So, Popper has this
picture of the scientific attitude that involves taking risks: making
bold claims, then gathering all the evidence you can think of that might
knock them down. If they stand up to your attempts to falsify them, the
claims are still in play]{.underline}. But, you keep that hard-headed
attitude and keep you eyes open for further evidence that could falsify
the claims. If you decide not to watch for such evidence \-- deciding,
in effect, that because the claim hasn\'t been falsified in however many
attempts you\'ve made to falsify it, it must be true \-- you\'ve crossed
the line to pseudo-science.  [This sets up the central asymmetry in
Popper\'s picture of what we can know. We can find evidence to establish
with certainty that a claim is false. However, we can never (owing to
the problem of induction) find evidence to establish with certainty that
a claim is true.]{.underline} So the scientist realizes that her best
hypotheses and theories are always tentative \-- some piece of future
evidence could conceivably show them false \-- while the
pseudo-scientist is sure as sure as can be that her theories have been
proven true. (Of course, they haven\'t been \-- problem of induction
again.) Advertisement  So, why does this difference between science and
pseudo-science matter? [As Popper notes, the difference is not a matter
of scientific theories always being true and pseudo-scientific theories
always being false. The important difference seems to be in which
approach gives better logical justification for knowledge claims. A
pseudo-science may make you feel like you\'ve got a good picture of how
the world works]{.underline}, but you could well be wrong about it. If a
scientific picture of the world is wrong, that hard-headed scientific
attitude means the chances are good that we\'ll find out we\'re wrong
\-- one of those tests of our hypotheses will turn up the data that
falsifies them \-- and switch to a different picture. [A few details are
important to watch here. The first is the distinction between a claim
that is falsifiable and a claim that has been falsified. Popper says
that scientific claims are falsifiable and pseudo-scientific claims are
not. A claim that has been falsified (demonstrated to be false) is
obviously a falsifiable claim (because, by golly, it\'s been falsified).
Once a claim has been falsified, Popper says the right thing to do is
let it go and move on to a different falsifiable claim]{.underline}.
However, it\'s not that the claim shouldn\'t have been a part of science
in the first place. So, the claim that the planets travel in circular
orbits wasn\'t an inherently unscientific claim. Indeed, because it
could be falsified by observations, it is just the kind of claim
scientists should work with. But, once the observations show that this
claim is false, scientists retire it and replace it with a different
falsifiable claim.  This detail is important! Popper isn\'t saying that
science never makes false claims! What he\'s saying is that the
scientific attitude is aimed at locating and removing the false claims
\-- something that doesn\'t happen in pseudo-sciences. Sign up for
Scientific American's free newsletters.  [Another note on
\"falsifiability\" \-- the fact that many attempts to falsify a claim
have failed does not mean that the claim is unfalsifiable. Nor, for that
matter, would the fact that the claim is true make it unfalsifiable. A
claim is falsifiable if there are certain observations we could make
that would tell us the claim is false \-- certain observable ways the
world could not be if the claim were true.]{.underline} So, the claim
that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit around the sun could be falsified
by observations of Mars moving in an orbit that deviated at all from an
elliptical shape.  [Another important detail is just what scientists
mean by \"theory\". A theory is simply a scientific account (or
description, or story) about a system or a piece of the world.
Typically, a theory will contain a number of hypotheses about what kind
of entities are part of the system and how those entities
behave]{.underline}. (The hypothesized behaviors are sometimes described
as the \"laws\" governing the system.) The important thing to note is
that theories can be rather speculative or extremely well tested \--
either way, they\'re still theories. Advertisement  [Some people talk as
though there\'s a certain threshold a theory crosses to become a fact,
or truth, or something more-certain-than-a-theory. This is a misleading
way of talking. Unless Popper is completely wrong that the scientist\'s
acceptance of a theory is always tentative (and this is one piece of
Popper\'s account that most scientists whole-heartedly endorse), then
even the theory with the best evidential support is still a
theory]{.underline}. Indeed, even if a theory happened to be completely
true, it would still be a theory! (Why? You could never be absolutely
certain that some future observation might not falsify the theory. In
other words, on the basis of the evidence, you can\'t be 100% sure that
the theory is true.)  [So, for example, dismissing Darwin\'s theory as
\"just a theory\" as if that were a strike against it is
misunderstanding what science is up to. Of course there is some
uncertainty; there is with all scientific theories]{.underline}. Of
course there are certain claims the theory makes that might turn out to
be false; but the fact that there is evidence we could conceivably get
to demonstrate these claims are false is a scientific virtue, not a sign
that the theory is unscientific.  [By contrast, \"Creation Science\" and
\"Intelligent Design Theory\" don\'t make falsifiable claims (at least,
this is what many people think; Larry Laudan\* disputes this but points
out different reasons these theories don\'t count as scientific).
There\'s no conceivable evidence we could locate that could demonstrate
the claims of these theories are false.]{.underline} Thus, these
theories just aren\'t scientific. Certainly, their proponents point to
all sorts of evidence that fits well with these theories, but they never
make any serious efforts to look for evidence that could prove the
theories false. Their acceptance of these theories isn\'t a matter of
having proof that the theories are true, or even a matter of these
theories having successfully withstood many serious attempts to falsify
them. Rather, it\'s a matter of faith. [ None of this means Darwin\'s
theory is necessarily true and \"Creation Science\" is necessarily
false. But it does mean (in the Popperian view that most scientists
endorse) that Darwin\'s theory is scientific and \"Creation Science\" is
not.]{.underline}

#### There is a difference between science and psychoanalysis- it comes down to verifiability

**Entailing Predictions,** no date, \"Popper, Karl: Philosophy of
Science,\" No Publication, https://www.iep.utm.edu/pop-sci/

[In order to see how falsificationism works in practice, it will help to
consider one of Popper's most memorable examples: the contrast between
Einstein's theory of general relativity and the theories of
psychoanalysis defended by [Sigmund
Freud](https://www.iep.utm.edu/freud/) and Alfred Adler]{.underline}. We
might roughly summarize the theories as follows: General relativity
(GR): Einstein's theory of special relativity posits that the observed
speed of light in a vacuum will be the same for all observers,
regardless of which direction or at what velocity these observers are
themselves moving. GR allows this theory to be applied to cases where
acceleration or gravity plays a role, specifically by treating gravity
as a sort of distortion or bend in space-time created by massive
objects. Psychoanalysis: The theory of psychoanalysis holds that human
behavior is driven at least in part by unconscious desires and motives.
[For example, Freud posited the existence of the id, an unconscious part
of the human psyche that aims toward gratifying instinctive desires,
regardless of whether this is rational. However, the desires of the id
might be mediated or superseded in certain circumstances by its
interaction with both the self-interested ego and the moral superego. As
we can see, both theories make bold, counter-intuitive claims about the
fundamental nature of reality.]{.underline} Moreover, both theories can
account for previously observed phenomena; for example, GR allows for an
accurate description of the observed perihelion of Mercury, while
psychoanalysis entails that it is possible for people to consistently
act in ways that are against their own long-term best interest.
[Finally, both of these theories enjoyed significant support among their
academic peers when Popper was first writing about these issues. Popper
argues, however, that GR is scientific **while psychoanalysis is
not**]{.underline}. The reason for this has to do with the testability
of Einstein's theory. [As a young man, Popper was especially impressed
by Arthur Eddington's 1919 test of GR, which involved observing during a
solar eclipse the degree to which the light from distant stars was
shifted when passing by the sun. Importantly, the predictions of GR
regarding the magnitude shift disagreed with the then-dominant theory of
Newtonian mechanics.]{.underline} Eddington's observation thus served as
a crucial experiment for deciding between the theories, since it was
impossible for both theories to give accurate predictions. Of necessity,
at least one theory would be falsified by the experiment, which would
provide strong reason for scientists to accept its unfalsified rival.
[On Popper's view, the continual effort by scientists to design and
carry out these sorts of potentially falsifying experiments played a
central role in theory choice and clearly distinguished scientific
theorizing from other sorts of activities. Popper also takes care to
note that insofar as GR was not a unified field theory, there was no
question of GR's being the complete truth]{.underline}, as Einstein
himself repeatedly emphasized. The scientific status of GR, then, had
nothing to do with neither (1) the truth of GR as a general theory of
physics (the theory was already known to false) nor (2) the confirmation
of GR by evidence (one cannot confirm a false theory). In contrast to
such paradigmatically scientific theories as GR, Popper argues that
non-scientific theories such as Freudian psychoanalysis do not make any
predictions that might allow them to be falsified. The reason for this
is that these theories are compatible with every possible observation.
[On Popper's view, psychoanalysis simply does not provide us with
adequate details to rule out any possible human behavior. Absent of
these sorts of precise predictions, the theory can be made to fit with,
and to provide a purported explanation of, any observed behavior
whatsoever.]{.underline} To illustrate this point, Popper offers the
example of two men, one who pushes a child into the water with the
intent of drowning it, and another who dives into the water in order to
save the child. Popper notes that psychoanalysis can explain both of
these seemingly contradictory actions[. In the first case, the
psychoanalyst can claim that the action was driven by a repressed
component of the (unconscious) id and in the second case, that the
action resulted from a successful sublimation of this exact same sort of
desire by the ego and superego.]{.underline} The point generalizes that
regardless of how a person actually behaves, psychoanalysis can be used
to explain the behavior. This, in turn, prevents us from formulating any
crucial experiments that might serve to falsify psychoanalysis. [Popper
writes: The point is very clear. Neither Freud nor Adler excludes any
particular person's acting in any particular way, whatever the outward
circumstances.]{.underline} Whether a man sacrificed his life to rescue
a drowning child (a case of sublimation) or whether he murdered the
child by drowning (a case of repression) could not possibly be predicted
or excluded by Freud's theory. (1974, p. 985) [Popper allows that there
are often legitimate purposes for positing non-scientific theories, and
he argues that theories which start out as non-scientific can later
become scientific, as we determine methods for generating and testing
specific predictions based on these theories. Popper offers the example
of Copernicus's theory of a sun-centered universe, which initially
yielded no potentially falsifying predictions, and so would not have
counted as scientific by Popper's criteria]{.underline}. However, later
astronomers determined ways of testing Copernicus's hypothesis, thus
rendering it scientific. For Popper, then, the demarcation between
scientific and non-scientific theories is not grounded on the nature of
entities posited by theories, by the truth or usefulness of theories, or
even by the degree to which we are justified in believing in such
theories. Instead, falsification provides a methodological distinction
based on the unique role that observation and evidence play in
scientific practice.

[DO WE NEED FORMAL QUALITY STANDARDS FOR SCIENCE? New guidelines
proposed by the National Institutes of Health have already been rejected
by several major scientific journals. Science is supposed to be
self-correcting]{.underline}. Unlike [auto
manufacturing](http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/FMVSS/) or [food
production](http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/standards), science is
expected to produce trustworthy results without explicit standards of
quality that are imposed from the top down. Quality control is supposed
to be baked into the scientific process itself. Before it's published,
research is peer-reviewed to root out flaws; and even after that, a
finding is not considered truly trustworthy until it is replicated by
other experts in the field[. In other words, there is no official seal
of approval---quality assurance comes from the expert judgment of
communities of scientists, who are supposed to be able to filter out the
good from the bad on their own.]{.underline} But are science\'s built-in
quality controls good enough? [There is [growing
concern](http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/can-social-scientists-save-themselves-human-behavior-78858)that
science is [failing to
self-correct](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21588069-scientific-research-has-changed-world-now-it-needs-change-itself-how-science-goes-wrong),
and that much of the research that\'s published, especially in the
biomedical sciences, doesn\'t stand up to scrutiny. While there is no
definitive study showing that this is true, evidence of the problem
includes [claims by drug company
scientists](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7391/full/483531a.html)
that they are often unable to replicate the relevant published findings
when they begin to develop a new drug, and surveys reporting that a
shockingly large fraction of studies use [less-than-optimal study
designs and poor statistical
practices](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2779358/)]{.underline}.
In response to the evidence that science's inherent quality-control
processes are failing, some researchers have [called for formal
standards](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25035389) in order to
ensure that studies don\'t fall prey to common and preventable mistakes.
[The leadership of the National Institutes of Health agreed,
[acknowledging
that](http://www.nature.com/news/policy-nih-plans-to-enhance-reproducibility-1.14586)
\"the recent evidence showing the irreproducibility of significant
numbers of biomedical-research publications demands immediate and
substantive action.\"]{.underline} Last summer, the National Institutes
of Health brought together its staff and the editors of many major
science journals in order to develop a set of explicit quality
standards. The standards they developed are targeted at \"pre-clinical\"
research, meaning studies done using laboratory animals rather than
humans. One reason for the focus on pre-clinical research is that it
currently operates under relatively few formal standards, unlike human
clinical trials, which are governed by an extensive set of regulations.
Shoddy pre-clinical research is a serious problem because pre-clinical
studies are the foundation on which costly drug development programs and
human clinical trials are built. A promising finding from an ultimately
flawed animal study will needlessly risk patient safety while also
squandering time and money as medical researchers and pharmaceutical
companies chase false leads. [The NIH released its [new
guidelines](http://www.nih.gov/about/reporting-preclinical-research.htm)
last fall and asked scientific journals to sign on to them. [Many
did](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/346/6210/679.full). But not
all---in April, several journals politely but pointedly refused. The
editors of one of them, Biophysical Journal, [explained their
refusal](http://www.cell.com/biophysj/fulltext/S0006-3495(15)00230-1),
noting that while they agreed with the intent of the guidelines, the
guidelines themselves \"are not pertinent or applicable to the types of
science published by Biophysical Journal." The president of the
Federation for American Societies for Experimental Biology, an umbrella
organization whose member societies publish dozens of scientific
journals, was more blunt in his [open letter to the
NIH](http://www.faseb.org/Portals/2/PDFs/opa/2015/4.8.15%20FASEB%20Response%20to%20NIH%20Preclin%20Guidelines.pdf):]{.underline}
"FASEB finds these guidelines to be premature, to lack the appropriate
flexibility to be applicable across disciplines, and to likely produce
significant and in some cases unjustified burden associated with the
preparation and review of scientific manuscripts.\" Other major
societies and journals, including the United Kingdom\'s Royal Society
and the American Chemical Society, have also refused to endorse the
guidelines, according to [Nature
News](http://www.nature.com/news/us-societies-push-back-against-nih-reproducibility-guidelines-1.17354).
[Why are NIH\'s new quality-control guidelines so objectionable to some?
On a first read, the guidelines seem hard to argue with. They specify
that journals should check the statistical accuracy of submitted
manuscripts, ensure that experimental methods are described
completely]{.underline}, require that published data be freely shared,
and introduce best practice guidelines for especially problematic
issues, like evaluating data that comes from image processing. [The new
policies also mandate that journals develop a policy that takes
responsibility for the accuracy of each paper they publish by being
willing to issue subsequent refutations of that paper. In general, these
are all good ideas, and, in fact, most journals already have policies in
place that support many of them.]{.underline} The real problem lies in
their implementation, and it\'s here where the debate over the NIH
guidelines reveals why formal quality-control standards are so hard to
establish in science. The editors of Biophysical Journal and the
president of FASEB both noted that the guidelines don\'t apply well
across the many different types of research that get lumped under the
broad heading of \"biomedical sciences[.\" As the Biophysical
Journaleditors wrote, the guidelines \"are primarily directed at large
correlative statistical preclinical and clinical studies,\"]{.underline}
which diverge from the types of basic research published in their
journal. The key point of contention here is the distinction between
basic, exploratory research, which is aimed at making new discoveries,
and pre-clinical research, which is carried out with the specific intent
to test new drugs or treatments. It sounds simple, but in practice, the
dividing line between the two modes of science is fuzzy. The president
of FASEB noted this fuzziness and argued that \"there remains a great
deal of confusion regarding what research is covered under these new
guidelines.\" [Many of the requirements laid out in the NIH guidelines
are important for effective pre-clinical studies, but impractical or
downright irrelevant for exploratory studies. For example, cancer
researchers studying the effect of some new drug in mice should follow
the guidelines and randomly assign animals to receive either the drug or
the placebo in order to avoid unconsciously biasing the results. But
this procedure makes no sense for cancer researchers conducting a study
to understand the function of a new mutation---you can't randomly assign
a mouse to acquire a mutation.]{.underline} Asking journals to adopt a
set of quality-control standards that don\'t accommodate these different
modes of research is, at best, a pointless administrative burden, and,
at worst, counter-productive. So how should we go about enforcing high
scientific standards? By simply raising the issue, the NIH may already
be doing some good---even scientific journals that declined to accept
the new guidelines have [re-evaluated and updated their
standards](http://www.cell.com/pb/assets/raw/journals/society/biophysj/PDFs/reproducibility-guidelines.pdf).
But ultimately, quality control in research does really come down to
science's intrinsic ability to self-correct[. Individual journals and
scientific communities must set their own quality standards to fit the
work that they cover. Despite the claims that there are widespread
problems in biomedical research, the overall quality of such a widely
varying set of research practices is almost impossible to measure--you
can't reliably make sweeping claims about [how much published research
is
"false."](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)
The methods and types of data that count as convincing evidence in
pre-clinical cancer research or psychology are very different from the
types of evidence used to reach conclusions in biophysics or cell
biology. Most importantly, it's critical to recognize that scientific
methods are constantly changing. That means, in the words of the
Biophysical Journal editors about their own journal's policy, "as
research and techniques evolve, so too will the
guidelines."]{.underline}

#### Falsifiability is the main indicator for good science standards

Dan **Gezelter,** 12-1-20**09**, \"Being Scientific: Fasifiability,
Verifiability, Empirical Tests, and Reproducibility,\" No Publication,
http://openscience.org/being-scientific-fasifiability-verifiability-empirical-tests-and-reproducibility/

[If you ask a scientist what makes a good experiment, you'll get very
specific answers about reproducibility and controls and methods of
teasing out causal relationships between variables and observables. If
human observations are involved, you may get detailed descriptions of
blind and double-blind experimental designs. In contrast, if you ask the
very same scientists what makes a theory or explanation scientific,
you'll often get a vague **statement about
falsifiability**.]{.underline} Scientists are usually very good at
designing experiments to test theories. We invent theoretical entities
and explanations all the time, but very rarely are they stated in ways
that are falsifiable. It is also quite rare for anything in science to
be stated in the form of a deductive argument. Experiments often aren't
done to falsify theories, but to provide the weight of repeated and
varied observations in support of those same theories. [Sometimes we'll
even use the words verify or confirm when talking about the results of
an experiment. What's going on? Is falsifiability the standard? Or
something else? The difference between falsifiability and verifiability
in science deserves a bit of elaboration. It is not always obvious (even
to scientists) what principles they are using to evaluate scientific
theories]{.underline},
[1](http://openscience.org/being-scientific-fasifiability-verifiability-empirical-tests-and-reproducibility/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-312)
so we'll start a discussion of this difference by thinking about
Popper's asymmetry.
[2](http://openscience.org/being-scientific-fasifiability-verifiability-empirical-tests-and-reproducibility/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-312)
Consider a scientific theory (T) that predicts an observation (O).
[There are two ways we could approach adding the weight of experiment to
a particular theory. We could attempt to falsify or verify the
observation. Only one of these approaches (falsification) is deductively
valid]{.underline}: If T, then O Not-OIf T, then O O

[Popper concluded that it is impossible to know that a theory is true
based on observations (O); science can tell us only that the theory is
false (or that it has yet to be refuted). He concluded that meaningful
scientific statements are falsifiable. A more realistic picture of
scientific theories isn't this simple. We often base our theories on a
set of auxiliary assumptions which we take as postulates for our
theories]{.underline}. For example, a theory for liquid dynamics might
depend on the whole of classical mechanics being taken as a postulate,
or a theory of viral genetics might depend on the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium[. In these cases, classical mechanics (or the Hardy-Wienberg
equilibrium) are the auxiliary assumptions for our specific
theories.]{.underline} These auxiliary assumptions can help show that
science is often not a deductively valid exercise. The Quine-Duhem
thesis
[3](http://openscience.org/being-scientific-fasifiability-verifiability-empirical-tests-and-reproducibility/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-312)
recovers the symmetry between falsification and verification when we
take into account the role of the auxiliary assumptions (AA) of the
theory (T): If (T and AA), then O Not-OIf (T and AA), then O O

[That is, if the predicted observation (O) turns out to be false, we can
deduce only that something is wrong with the conjunction, (T and AA); we
cannot determine from the premises that it is T rather than AA that is
false]{.underline}. In order to recover the asymmetry, we would need our
assumptions (AA) to be independently verifiable: If (T and AA), then O
AA Not-OIf (T and AA), then O AA O

Falsifying a theory requires that auxiliary assumption (AA) be
demonstrably true. Auxiliary assumptions are often highly theoretical
--- remember, auxiliary assumptions might be statements like the
entirety of classical mechanics is correct or the Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium is valid! It is important to note, that if we can't verify
AA, we will not be able to falsify T by using the valid argument above.
Contrary to Popper, there really is no asymmetry between falsification
and verification. If we cannot verify theoretical statements, then we
cannot falsify them either. Since verifying a theoretical statement is
nearly impossible, and falsification often requires verification of
assumptions, where does that leave scientific theories? What is required
of a statement to make it scientific? Carl Hempel came up with one of
the more useful statements about the properties of scientific theories:
[4](http://openscience.org/being-scientific-fasifiability-verifiability-empirical-tests-and-reproducibility/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-312)
"The statements constituting a scientific explanation must be capable of
empirical test." And this statement about what exactly it means to be
scientific brings us right back to things that scientists are very good
at: experimentation and experimental design. If I propose a scientific
explanation for a phenomenon, it should be possible to subject that
theory to an empirical test or experiment. We should also have a
reasonable expectation of universality of empirical tests. That is
multiple independent (skeptical) scientists should be able to subject
these theories to similar tests in different locations, on different
equipment, and at different times and get similar answers.
Reproducibility of scientific experiments is therefore going to be
required for universality. So to answer some of the questions we might
have about reproducibility: Reproducible by whom? By independent
(skeptical) scientists, working elsewhere, and on different equipment,
not just by the original researcher. Reproducible to what degree? This
would depend on how closely that independent scientist can reproduce the
controllable variables, but we should have a reasonable expectation of
similar results under similar conditions. Wouldn't the expense of a
particular apparatus make reproducibility very difficult? Good
scientific experiments must be reproducible in both a conceptual and an
operational sense.
[5](http://openscience.org/being-scientific-fasifiability-verifiability-empirical-tests-and-reproducibility/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-312)
If a scientist publishes the results of an experiment, there should be
enough of the methodology published with the results that a
similarly-equipped, independent, and skeptical scientist could reproduce
the results of the experiment in their own lab.

#### The rest of the card concludes we still should use scientific models as they are the most practical instruments of measurements.

James **Clear**, no date, \"All Models Are Wrong: How to Make Decisions
in an Imperfect World,\" https://jamesclear.com/all-models-are-wrong

[Doing the Best We Can With What We Have Accepting that all models are
wrong in certain instances is not a license to ignore the facts. As a
society, we should search for better answers, look for evidence, and
strive to increase the accuracy of our knowledge. At the same time,
there is a common peril on the other end of the spectrum. Too many
people waste time debating if something is perfectly correct, when they
should be focusing on if it is practically useful. We live in a world
filled with uncertainty, but we still need to get things done and make
decisions]{.underline}. It is our responsibility to develop a way of
thinking about the world that generally fits the facts we have, but to
not get so gummed up thinking about things that we never actually do
anything. As Harvard professor Daniel Gilbert puts it, "[The world
doesn't have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes
action." Impartial answers are the best we have. Focus on what is
practical and take action. All models are wrong under some
circumstances, but the important thing is if they are generally
useful.]{.underline}

#### Postmodernism is fueled by capitalist motives

Purpose)", Palgrave Macmillan, pg. 38)//

[In the event, the new conditions of scarcity proved especially
congenial to ambitious young post-structuralist scholars who, sensing
opportunity in the air, deftly positioned themselves at the vanguard of
theory. We must us be clear, however, that the success of postmodernism,
its relative success during a period of neoliberal retrenchment in
higher education and broad left decline, occurred not merely because its
ideas were appealing, but because its proponents were able to secure
serious institutional backing and money within the university
system]{.underline}. In contrast to the portrait post-structuralists
have painted of themselves as "transgressive" and "subversive" of norms,
they have managed to cultivate and maintain surprisingly cozy
relationships with university administrators, enabling them to
monopolize much of the available funding for research and programming in
the humanities. Helping the new mavericks survive and thrive in the new
environment were the new humanities institutes and centers, which from
the 1980s on provided an institutional beachhead for a new postmodernist
habitus. [Anchored in elite universities like Yale, Harvard, Cornell,
and UC Irvine, the new funding and research centers served to stabilize
and legitimate humanities research at a time when administrators and
departments were beginning to feel pressured to pool increasingly scarce
resources and to forge new institutional alliances. The institutes
played a key role both in professionalizing critical theory and in
policing its boundaries, chiefly by propagating an elitist prestige
culture that was largely (though not exclusively) grounded in
post-structuralist thought.16]{.underline} The School of Criticism and
Theory at Cornell University, to cite one example, took out paid
advertisements in academic journals in the late-1990s, promising
graduate students and young scholars the opportunity to "study with
leading figures in critical theory"---academic "stars"---to keep up to
date on "recent developments in literary and humanistic studies." The
school, the ads proclaimed, "sets up levels of expectations of what it
takes to be a top-flight academic and scholar, not only in the United
States, but internationally."17 The message could not have been clearer:
No graduate student or young professor struggling in the humanities can
afford to be uninterested in learning what the expectations of being "a
top-flight academic and scholar" are. The budding intellectual would now
be forced, like any other consumer, to participate in what Wolfgang Haug
termed "the endless chase for the appearances of use-value in which . .
. commodities are wrapped."18

#### Postmodern attacks on science causes the religious right to fill in and hinders social progress

[What do left intellectuals do when they know that they are too
marginalized to change the world? They get busy interpreting the world,
of course. And interpreting how we interpret the world, and how the
non-Western \"Others\" interpret it, and how we interpret others\'
interpretations . . . and ad infinitum. The interpretive turn allows the
left to create in discourse what it is unable to realize in the rough
and tumble of real politics: a world where all ideologies have been
deconstructed, revealed, and readied for overthrow; a world where all
can live by their own lights.]{.underline} The inverse relationship
between an explosion of high theory and a decline in political efficacy
appears to be as true today as it was when Perry Anderson first observed
it nearly two decades ago in his Considerations of Western Marxism. What
follows here is an appeal by an \"Other,\" in whose name many
contemporary left theorists justify their interpretive turn, to think
about how their epistemological egalitarianism affects the urgent task
of transforming oppressive social structures and cultural values in
non-Western societies. I will argue that the recent rise in political
and cultural visibility of the religious right (the [Bharatiya Janata
party](http://bjp.org/), or BJP, and its affiliates) in my native India
should give pause to all those academics in the West and in the third
world who describe the rationality of \"Western\" science itself as a
source of imperialism and racism. Hindu nationalists have heeded the
call for \"decolonizing\" science, and responded with aggressive
propaganda for \"Hindu ways of knowing,\" which they present as the
locally embedded alternative to the alien and colonizing Western
science. The two examples of the right\'s \"Hinduization\" of science
and politics that I will discuss \-- the introduction of Vedic
mathematics in public schools and the spread of [\"Vastu
shastra\"](http://doric.bart.ucl.ac.uk/web/VE/1995/Shalini/introvastu.html)
(ancient Indian material science) \-- do indeed meet the criteria of
decolonized science advocated by left theorists: both are opposed to
\"Eurocentric Northern\" ways of knowing; both are \"situated
knowledges\" of non-Western people. The question I want to pose in the
light of the BJP\'s victory is whether such knowledge is a step forward
for women, minorities, and the desperately poor in non-Western
societies. Does the project of de-Westernizing science deserve the
support of my fellow progressive intellectuals? As a one-time biologist,
science writer, and a partisan of science-for-the-people movements in
India and in the United States, [I have watched with increasing unease
the transnational alliance that has emerged around the idea that the
rationality of modern science encodes Western and imperialistic
social-cultural values, and is therefore inimical to the interests of
non-Western peoples. The alliance brings together some of the most
avant-garde scholars in U.S. universities with the neopopulist,
cultural-nationalist, \"postcolonial\" intellectuals from the third
world, most notably India. Indeed, the cluster of ideas that
postmodernist intellectuals deploy to deconstruct the supposedly
Eurocentric assumptions of modern science appears with high frequency in
the discourse of Hindu fundamentalist parties. The Hindu right has
proclaimed the twenty-first century a \"Hindu century\" on the
theoretical grounds made respectable by left critics of science. These
reverse Orientalists who glorify whatever the Western powers devalued
are walking through the door that the critics of Orientalism opened for
them. The tools that deconstruct also construct]{.underline}.
Constructivist theories of science have cleared a discursive and
political space that the nationalistic right is only too eager to move
into. Indeed, the right could not have wished for a more fashionable
neighborhood to pitch its own tent in. Making the content and
rationality of science an epiphenomenon of the wider cultural and social
structures is no doubt useful for exposing the play of power in
supposedly objective accounts of the world. But when science is joined
to culture at the hip in the constructivist fashion, it also opens the
door to the so-called \"ethno-sciences\" \-- \"Hindu science,\"
\"Islamic science,\" \"third world women\'s science\" \-- wherein
scientific rationality is subordinated to the \"forms of life\" of
different communities. When the existing social values are allowed to
decide the validity of knowledge, knowledge loses whatever power it has
to critique these often oppressive values. [It is this deference to the
existing \"forms of life\" that makes the project of constructing
different ethno-sciences for different peoples so hospitable to all
kinds of conservative social forces. Thus, when the secular and mostly
left-inclined critics claim \-- in the language and tone that Alan Sokal
managed to feign so convincingly in his [Social Text
hoax](http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/) of last year \-- that
scientific facts cannot be judged as objectively true or false, but only
from within the \"regime of truth\" established by social power, the
religious right reads in it a justification for its demand that the
validity of Hindu science be judged only on its \"own terms.\" When the
academic critics argue that scientific rationality must be subordinated
to cultural instrumentalities, the religious right finds in it an
affirmation of its own cultural chauvinism.]{.underline} One cannot
avoid a shock of recognition when one reads, for instance, the BJP\'s
recent Humanistic Approach to Economic Development, which insists that
the cultural ethos of the Hindu Rashtra (nation) must become \"a light
onto itself,\" and have the final authority over what aspects of
\"foreign\" science and technology are admitted into schools and other
institutions. Hasn\'t one encountered similar appeals for integration of
values and politics in knowledge-seeking activities in more academic,
self-described \"progressive\" critiques of science? If the critics see
science as a dystopian, arrogant and \"God\'s-eye view of the world,\"
supposedly transcending the material lives and beliefs of people, the
BJP is only too happy to offer a supposedly humbler and more situated
\"Mother India\'s view of the world.\" If, as the critics charge, the
very logic of modern science is a cultural expression of a Western
\"will to power,\" then the Hindu nationalists justifiably consider it
their patriotic duty to resist modern science, and to replace it with
ways of knowing informed by the imagined Hindu values of holism,
communitarianism, and androgyny. Interestingly, the ruthlessness with
which the critics interrogate \"Western\" science is matched in
intensity only by their charity and solicitousness toward non-Western,
pre-scientific ways of knowing.

### Falsifiability DA/pik

#### Their epistemology is invalid and non-falsifiable 

**Nickles 17** (Thomas Nickles -- Nevada University Philosophy
Professor, 2017, "Falsifiability - Popper\'s Emphasis On
Falsifiability",
<http://science.jrank.org/pages/9302/Falsifiability-Popper-s-Emphasis-on-Falsifiability.html>,)

[Falsifiable contrasts with verifiable. A claim is empirically
verifiable if possible observation statements logically imply the truth
of the claim. If actual observation statements do imply the claim, then
it is verified.]{.underline} \"This raven is black\" verifies \"There
are black ravens.\" During the 1930s the logical empiricists of the
Vienna Circle proposed verifiability both as a criterion of demarcation
of science from nonscience and a criterion of meaning. Their idea was
that a statement is meaningful if and only if verifiable in principle,
and its meaning is given by its method of verification. For the logical
empiricists, only empirically verifiable claims make genuine assertions
about the world and are, in this broad sense, scientific. All other
claims (metaphysical, religious, ethical, etc.) are cognitively
meaningless. In his Logik der Forschung (1934; Logic of Scientific
Discovery), [Popper replied by rejecting the logical empiricists\'
concern with language and meaning and by noting that verifiability as a
criterion of demarcation excludes scientific law claims and thus the
core of science itself. For since a law claim is universal in scope (in
simplest form, \"All As everywhere and everywhen are Bs\"), it cannot
possibly be verified: there are always actual or potential instances
beyond those so far observed. **Yet a universal claim can be falsified
by a single negative instance.**]{.underline} The first observed black
swan refuted the claim \"All swans are white.\" (Law claims of
statistical-probabilistic forms are more problematic.) Based on this
logical asymmetry of verification and falsification, [Popper proposed
falsifiability as a criterion of demarcation of science from nonscience,
although not as a criterion of meaning. According to Popper, nonscience
includes pseudoscience (e.g., Freudian psychology and Marxism) and
metaphysics, the one fraudulent, the other sometimes providing a
valuable heuristic for science. Many deep scientific problems have their
roots in metaphysics, but to be scientific, a claim must take an
empirical risk. Moreover, falsifiability, as the ongoing risk of
falsification in our world, is a permanent status for
Popper]{.underline}. No amount of successful testing can establish a
hypothesis as absolutely true or even probable: it forever remains
conjectural. That all scientific theories remain falsifiable entails
fallibilism, the view that our best epistemic efforts remain open to
future revision. There can be no certain foundations to knowledge.
Popper\'s falsifiability doctrine lies at the heart of his empiricist
epistemology and scientific methodology of \"conjectures and
refutations.\" The latter, he claims, shows how it is possible to learn
from experience without induction from the facts. Previously, empiricism
had been equated with inductivism. Popper attacked as question-begging
the view that we must arrive at our ideas by induction, that is, by
first gathering masses of facts and then gradually detecting regular
patterns in them---letting nature speak for herself. Rather, said
Popper, we first propose a conjecture to solve a problem, then test the
conjecture by trying to falsify it. [It is the conjecture that tells us
which observations are even relevant. Contrary to the inductivists, it
does not matter where our ideas come from, only how we test them. There
is no logic of discovery, only a logic of testing. Since law claims can
be falsified but not verified, Popper concluded that the way to truth is
indirect, by elimination of falsehood. Hence, error, in the sense of
faulty hypotheses, is not a bad thing. On the contrary, it is necessary
to scientific progress. \"We learn from our mistakes.\" This is
Popper\'s more extreme form of the nineteenth-century idea that science
is a fallible but self-correcting enterprise.]{.underline} Since bold
hypotheses that yield novel predictions are risky and hence easier to
test, Popper urged boldness. He explicitly forbade, as a form of
intellectual dishonesty, ad hoc tinkering to save a hypothesis from
falsification. Popper spoke of degrees of falsifiability and attempted,
with limited success, to measure both simplicity and the empirical
content of a claim (how much it says about the world) in terms of its
degree of falsifiability.

\*edited for ableist language

That is precisely what happens worldwide to people who deny the
connection between H.I.V. and AIDS, as superbly documented by the
journalist Michael Specter. [Indulging in a bit of pseudoscience in some
instances may be relatively innocuous, but the problem is that doing so
lowers your defenses against more dangerous delusions \[misconceptions\]
that are based on similar confusions and fallacies. For instance, you
may expose yourself and your loved ones to harm because your
pseudoscientific proclivities lead you to accept notions that have been
scientifically disproved, like the increasingly (and worryingly) popular
idea that vaccines cause autism]{.underline}. Philosophers nowadays
recognize that there is no sharp line dividing sense from nonsense, and
moreover that doctrines starting out in one camp may over time evolve
into the other[. For example, alchemy was a (somewhat) legitimate
science in the times of Newton and Boyle, but it is now firmly
pseudoscientific (movements in the opposite direction, from full-blown
pseudoscience to genuine science, are notably rare]{.underline}). The
verdict by philosopher Larry Laudan, echoed by Asma, that the
demarcation problem is dead and buried, is not shared by most
contemporary philosophers who have studied the subject. Even the
criterion of falsifiability, for example, is still a useful benchmark
for distinguishing science and pseudoscience, as a first approximation.
Asma's own counterexample inadvertently shows this: the "cleverness" of
astrologers in cherry-picking what counts as a confirmation of their
theory, is hardly a problem for the criterion of falsifiability, but
rather a nice illustration of Popper's basic insight: [the bad habit of
creative fudging and finagling with empirical data ultimately makes a
theory impervious to refutation. And all pseudoscientists do it, from
parapsychologists to creationists and 9/11 Truthers]{.underline}. Asma's
equating of Qi energy with the "sacrosanct scientific method," as if
both are on the same par, is especially worrisome. Aside from comparing
a doctrine about how the world works (Qi) with an open-ended method for
obtaining knowledge, what exactly is "sacrosanct" about a method that
readily allows for the integration of willow bark and turtle blood,
provided that they hold up to scrutiny? [The open-ended nature of
science means that there is nothing sacrosanct in either its results or
its methods. The borderlines between genuine science and pseudoscience
may be fuzzy, but this should be even more of a call for careful
distinctions, based on systematic facts and sound
reasoning.]{.underline} To try a modicum of turtle blood here and a
little aspirin there is not the hallmark of wisdom and even-mindedness.
[It is a dangerous gateway to superstition and
irrationality.]{.underline}

#### That allows for climate deniers to undermine warming efforts

**Brown 16** (Michael J. I. Brown -- Monash University Associate
professor, December 11, 2016, "Trump has embraced pseudoscience and its
deceptive tactics in a post-truth world",
<https://theconversation.com/trump-has-embraced-pseudoscience-and-its-deceptive-tactics-in-a-post-truth-world-70134>,)

[As a scientist, I expect the Trump presidency to have a curious
familiarity. Why? Because the relentless stream of falsehoods and
character attacks of Trump's campaign mainstreamed disinformation
tactics that biologists, immunologists and climate scientists have come
to know and despise. Trump has embraced pseudoscience and its
accompanying conspiracy theories]{.underline}. He's tweeted that climate
change is a hoax and vaccines cause autism. Trump has met with Andrew
Wakefield, whose fraudulent 1998 study kickstarted the modern
anti-vaccine movement. And he has just appointed a climate change denier
to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. These pseudoscience
communities are nothing new, and they haven't even bothered to rebadge
themselves as "alt-science" (yet). [It's critical that the broader
community learns from the grim experience of scientists when dealing
with these attacks. Often scientists failed to appreciate that many
public arguments about science are actually political battles, rather
than evidence-based discussions. Raw political battle isn't about
seeking truth and reasoned argument. It's about winning news cycles and
elections]{.underline}. Debate Scientific argument is often methodical,
technical and slow. Perhaps this is exemplified by the biggest
scientific announcement of 2016, the detection of gravitational waves,
which were predicted by Einstein a century ago. I'm engaged in a
scientific argument right now about how rapidly galaxies form stars. My
key points are in a 10,000-word manuscript detailing the data, methods,
comparison with prior studies, and conclusions. An anonymous astronomer
is reviewing that manuscript, and I expect my article to be published in
2017. So if commentators or politicians demand "an honest debate" about
science, what are they doing? First, don't ignore the adjective
"honest", with its veiled implication of dishonesty. It can be the
starting point for conspiracy theories, with scientists and
organisations around the globe manipulating science for no good. What
kind of debate is being sought? Are both sides going to face off by
undertaking years of research and submitting 10,000-word manuscripts to
scientific journals? Not likely. Often a very literal debate is being
sought, either on television, radio or stage. [We find such debates,
with their rhetorical flourishes, provocative and entertaining but they
rarely advance science. When Albert Einstein and Phillip Lenard debated
relativity in 1920, Einstein wasn't the clear winner. Perhaps the
audience and newspapers that dutifully reported the debate didn't
appreciate that Lenard's arguments about fictitious gravitational fields
were wrong.]{.underline} Demands for debate -- such as the recent call
for one by Australian One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts -- are often
seeking formats where even Einstein couldn't win an argument about
relativity. They provide theatre and column inches. And critically, they
provide equal billing for scientists and those who've never truly
engaged in science. They embrace false equivalence. Who am I? I'm a
scientist, but on Twitter people have some strange ideas about who I am.
I've been accused of being a "warmist" and "alarmist" who is on the
"gravy train" with a "bed wetting agenda". (For the record, I prefer
people not to wet their beds.) I've encountered these accusations when
discussing evidence, and they're a means of derailing discussion.
"Warmist" and "alarmist" are attempts to frame scientific findings as
extreme political positions. Creationists can play this game too,
preferring "evolutionism" to "evolutionary biology". This tactic falsely
reframes the argument as a debate between competing and equivalent
ideological positions. It doesn't matter if the accusations have no
factual basis, embrace conspiracy theories or are insincere. That's not
the point. I've been accused of using neo-fascist techniques and
neo-Marxist attacks on the same day. [Donald Trump has never provided
evidence that climate change is a "hoax", with its accompanying global
conspiracy of scientists. This isn't reasoned argument; it's disrupting
discussion of evidence. It's about what needs to be true to reject
scientists, not what is actually true about scientists. Evidence
Scientists slowly accumulate evidence to test their hypotheses, but in
political fights evidence only needs to survive the news cycle. Robust
methodology, statistics and hypothesis testing be damned. I was reminded
of this recently when the US House Committee on Science, Space and
Technology tweeted a link to a Breitbart article claiming that global
temperatures are falling:]{.underline}

![](media/image1.png){width="1.5284930008748907in"
height="1.6176541994750657in"}

Breitbart wasn't reporting the findings of a new peer-reviewed study
with new data and a compelling analysis, but rather was quoting the
Daily Mail's David Rose. While the accumulation of data, from satellites
and weather stations, shows the globe warming over decades, Rose had a
different focus. He highlighted a few months of data, from a deprecated
dataset, that excluded polar regions and the oceans, to suggest the "run
of record temperatures are at an end". This is misinformation, as
there's no evidence to show an end to long-term global warming. Of
course scientists picked apart Rose's article, but by then the news
cycle had moved on.

![https://images.theconversation.com/files/149182/original/image-20161208-31370-1n6f3y6.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&fit=clip](media/image2.png){width="2.343538932633421in"
height="1.7581725721784778in"}

[Despite the long-term rise of sea levels, some media reporting
emphasises temporary dips.]{.underline} Such articles are a feature, not
a bug, in the politicised climate debate.In 2008, Bjorn Lomborg in The
Guardian noted "a slight drop" in sea levels, and concluded that we
"urgently need balance." In 2012, the Australian's Graham Lloyd reported
on sea level falls that supposedly "defied climate warnings." Of course,
those were blips in the long-term trend of sea level rise, but those
articles did effectively spread doubt about climate science. [Trump has
embraced pseudoscience and its tactics, and will be bringing it to the
White House. I expect the accusations and misinformation of Trump's
campaign to continue, and like many scientists I will find it all too
familiar. To argue with today's politically expedient statements as if
they're evidence-based and carefully reasoned arguments embraces a false
equivalence of fact and fiction. It is a time for true
scepticism.]{.underline}

#### Climate change results in extinction

**Pamlin and Armstrong 15** (Dennis Pamlin -- Oxford Research Fellow and
Dr Stuart Armstrong -- James Martin Research Fellow, Global Challenges
Foundation, February 2015, "The Case for a New Risk Category",
<https://api.globalchallenges.org/static/wp-content/uploads/12-Risks-with-infinite-impact.pdf>,)

[Many of the expected impacts of climate change are well known,
including a warming climate, more severe storms and droughts, rising sea
levels, ocean acidification, and damage to vulnerable ecosystems.114 As
for all risks there are uncertainties in the estimates, and warming
could be much more extreme than the middle estimates
suggest.]{.underline} Models tend to underestimate uncertainty115
(especially where impact on humanity is concerned,116 where the effect
also depends on modellers' choices such as the discount rate117), so
there is a probability118 that humanity could be looking at a 4°C119 or
even 6°C120 warming in the coming decades. [This could arise from
positive feedback loops, such as the release of methane from
permafrost121 or the dieback of the Amazon rainforests,122 **that
strengthen the warming effect**.]{.underline} So far, efforts at curbing
emissions have been only moderately successful and are still very far
from what is needed.123 The impact of global warming, whether mild or
severe, would be felt most strongly in poorer countries. Adaptation that
can address significant warming is often very expensive,124 and many of
the poorest countries are in the tropics and sub-tropics that would be
hardest hit (they could become completely uninhabitable for the highest
range of warming125). [Mass deaths and famines, social collapse and mass
migration are certainly possible in this scenario. Combined with shocks
to the agriculture and biosphere-dependent industries of the more
developed countries, this could lead to global conflict and possibly
civilisation collapse -- to the extent that many experts see climate
change as a national security risk126. Further evidence of the risk
comes from indications that past civilisation collapses have been driven
by climate change.127]{.underline}

### Disease mod

#### That allows for anti-vaxxers to spread their beliefs

Pascal-Emmanuel **Gobry**, 2-4-20**15**, (Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry is a
writer and fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. His writing
has appeared at Forbes, The Atlantic, First Things, Commentary
Magazine, The Daily Beast, The Federalist, Quartz, and other
places. \"Your close-minded disdain for anti-vaxxers isn\'t helping
anyone,\" No Publication,
https://theweek.com/articles/537430/closeminded-disdain-antivaxxers-isnt-helping-anyone)

[What is science? And what is the distinction between actual science and
\"Science\"? As I explained in a [previous
column](http://theweek.com/articles/443656/botched-understanding-science-ruins-everything)
describing this problem (and pointing to the anti-vax movement as one
symptom), science is a process for making reliable, nonobvious
predictions about the future through the practice of controlled
experiment.]{.underline} What we now call the Scientific Revolution
happened when scientists ditched the Aristotelian definition of science
as \"knowledge of the ultimate causes of things\" and instead focused on
investigating specific empirical claims through controlled experiment.
Scientific claims, properly speaking, concern only what the philosopher
of science Karl Popper called falsifiable claims, meaning empirical
claims that can be proven or disproven by experiment. By contrast,
public-imagination \"Science\" is basically just a synonym for
\"magic.\" \"[Science\" is complicated stuff with lots of math, and it
produces absolute truths and magical things]{.underline}. This has many
implications. The first is that actual science is, or ought to be,
intrinsically humble work: Science works precisely because it defines
its aims narrowly. Aristotelian \"science\" tried to explain everything,
and explained nothing. Baconian science tries to explain very little ---
only falsifiable empirical claims --- but with those very little pebbles
it builds very big mountains. But it also means that when you\'re not
dealing with a falsifiable empirical claim, you\'re not dealing,
properly speaking, with a scientific claim. And it also means that
successful scientific work is humble work. The second is that the magic
of the scientific method comes from that little word: \"controlled.\" A
controlled experiment allows you to make reliable, nonobvious
predictions about the future because it isolates all possible causes
from an effect but one, to see which causes cause which effect. Contrary
to popular myth, when Galileo did his revolutionary experiment on the
fall of heavy and light objects, he did not just drop two balls from the
tower of Pisa --- he designed elaborate contraptions to do experiments
that would take into account, for example, the potential effect of wind
resistance. Some kinds of science are harder than others. To perform
controlled experiments, you need to be able to isolate all causes but
one. In extremely complex environments, that is very hard to do. And it
turns out that things like the human body and human society are even
more complex than the beginnings of the Universe. In medicine and social
studies, it is much harder to produce good scientific knowledge ---
reliable, nonobvious predictions about the future validated by
controlled experiment --- because it is much harder to produce
controlled experiments, as it is much harder to isolate one cause. This
is typically done through randomized controlled experiment: split a
group randomly into two groups; give one of them a treatment, another a
placebo; because the groups are randomly split, all causes except the
treatment should cancel each other out. This is a great approach, and it
has produced a lot of progress. But to truly validate a claim, you
don\'t need just one experiment, you need replication over many
experiments, because the human body is so complex that there\'s still a
risk some other, unobserved cause might be at work. If physical science
is like blitzkrieg, medical science is more like trench warfare. Galileo
overturned 2,000 years of physics with one experiment; it took decades
to prove the link between smoking and cancer. [So, what does this have
to do with the anti-vaxxers? Well, here it is.]{.underline} If, like a
Grand Inquisitor or a creationist Christian, scientists start to drink
their own Kool-Aid and confuse actual science with \"Science,\" they
begin to saw off the branch they\'re sitting on. And people get mad. [As
wrong as the anti-vaxxers are about vaccines, one thing that\'s most
definitely not wrong about their outlook is that the medical
establishment has a heck of a record of using its authority to promote
junk \"Science\" as science.]{.underline} Take pediatrics, for example.
How about that time the American Academy of Pediatrics realized that an
infant sleeping in your bed is actually totally fine and their shrieking
about it was totally unjustified, and probably [actually led to
preventable deaths of
children](http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/12/dire-warnings-against-infant-bed-sharing-backfired)?
(Not that the fact that billions of people have been doing it for
millennia could have been a hint, or anything.) Or how about the fact
that the AAP still recommends circumcision for infant males (which
originally became prevalent in America because of a demented Christian
fundamentalist
[crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg#Masturbation_prevention)
against masturbation),
[unlike](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/circumcision-do-risks-outweigh-benefits/article18105881/)
practically every other international pediatrics body? Or consider
another domain where there\'s a lot of \"Science\" and not a lot of
science: diet and fitness. As Scott Adams [points
out](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/109880240641/sciences-biggest-fail),
over the lifespan of the average American, \"Science\" has been saying
--- each time very loudly, and each time with all the authority of
divine command --- black one day, and white the next. The media also
fuels our science-\"Science\" confusion, publishing studies showing a
statistically insignificant link between, say, eating kale and being
eaten by bears with a headline trumpeting \"according to science.\"
Blame our education system, too, where basic epistemology is
[devalued](http://www.forbes.com/sites/pascalemmanuelgobry/2014/06/13/its-urgent-to-put-the-liberal-arts-back-at-the-center-of-education/).
Is it any wonder that there are a lot of people who have stopped
trusting men in white coats talking about \"Science\"? Our politics also
turn science into \"Science.\" For decades, we have had politicians
pretending that [middle-school
science](http://www.lifenews.com/2015/01/08/41-quotes-from-medical-textbooks-prove-human-life-begins-at-conception/)
about when life begins is a big mystery. They also warn that Armageddon
awaits if carbon taxes aren\'t implemented, even though the IPCC
emphatically [does not say
that](http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/conservatives-climate-change-and-the-carbon-tax).
[There are problems with science on the right as well as the left, but
perhaps the best symbol of how bad the politicization of science --- and
its transformation from science into \"Science\" --- is can be seen in
this: Even though the anti-vax movement is a
[product](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/02/i-didn-t-vaccinate-my-child-and-i-regret-it.html)
of the loony left, liberal media outlets are trying as hard as possible
to [paint
it](https://twitter.com/gabrielmalor/status/562627863648935936) as a
product of the loony right. The lens of politics corrupts everything and
turns science into \"Science.\" The incentive to politicize science is
really attractive. And when academia becomes
[dominated](http://theweek.com/articles/441474/academias-liberal-bias-killing-social-science)
by one sort of person, it becomes nearly irresistible. But if scientists
want to maintain their credibility (not to mention do the right thing),
they need to resist]{.underline} it. Finally, one last tip from a
Christian: Be empathetic. In January, I predicted a new year of [online
outrage](http://theweek.com/articles/441234/avoid-another-year-outrage),
because the internet favors the phenomenon of scapegoating, in which a
group of people picks a lone person to project their sins onto and
destroy them to protect the strength of the community. Scapegoating is
always an evil impulse, and we should be wary of it, especially if the
victim \"has it coming\" as the anti-vaxxers do, since it only increases
the impetus. [As I\'ve tried to show above, the anti-vax movement might
not have even taken root if the medical establishment had been a little
more careful with their credibility, if we took time to think about what
science actually is, and if we weren\'t in such a rush to always turn
everything into a political football]{.underline}. Here\'s a thought
experiment: Imagine you have a lively, outgoing, wonderful toddler,
slowly becoming withdrawn, locked into their own world. As the parent of
a 3-year-old, the thought turns my stomach into knots. And the simple
fact of the matter is, we don\'t understand what causes autism, at all
(it might [not even be](http://www.wired.com/2013/04/neurodiversity/) a
disease!). And in our culture, the one thing we won\'t accept is that
something doesn\'t have a solution. The urge to try to come up with an
alternative explanation, while seriously misguided, is also deeply human
and, ultimately, understandable. There is [some
evidence](http://www.news.wisc.edu/21506) that beating people over the
head with arguments only makes them dig in more. I see all the
anti-anti-vax tweets, and I wonder: \"You do realize that probably no
anti-vaxxer reads you? Are you just tweeting to signal to your peers how
science-y you are?\" Righteously unloading on some poor person on the
internet feels really good --- trust me, I know --- but are you trying
to make yourself feel good, or do you want to actually change someone\'s
mind?

#### Lacking use of vaccines leads to resurgence of preventable diseases

Alexandra **Sifferlin** March 17, 2014, 3-17-20**14**, \"Here are some
diseases we\'re seeing thanks to anti-vaxxers,\" Time,
<https://time.com/27308/4-diseases-making-a-comeback-thanks-to-anti-vaxxers/>

[Measles has made a
[comeback](https://time.com/?p=27308&preview=true&preview_id=27308&preview_nonce=7fe0f41a07),
at least in New York City, where [as many as 19
cases](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Measles-Outbreak-More-Cases-Manhattan-Bronx--249451771.html)
have been confirmed. New York City isn't an anomaly, though. Diseases
that are and have been avoidable in the U.S. thanks to vaccines, are
resurfacing all across the country]{.underline}. Measles, for instance,
was considered wiped out in 2000, but there have been several outbreaks
in the past few years. [This
map](http://www.cfr.org/interactives/GH_Vaccine_Map/index.html#map)
shows outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases since 2008 (click on
"Map" and select which diseases and regions you want to see). [The
emergence of these diseases --- especially measles --- is alarming, and
mostly due to parents in the U.S. not vaccinating their kids. "If you
are unvaccinated and you come in contact with measles, there's a 90%
chance you will get it,"]{.underline} says Jason McDonald, a
spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Though measles outbreaks are primarily linked to unvaccinated people,
McDonald notes that some vaccines aren't foolproof. For example, the
whooping-cough vaccine may lose its efficacy over time. And, overall,
most people do get their vaccinations. A CDC
[report](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6230a3.htm) looking
at children entering kindergarten for the 2012--13 school year in all
U.S. states found that more than 90% of these kids had their vaccines.
Still, there are people --- [including public figures and
celebrities](https://time.com/25719/kristin-cavallari-is-an-anti-vaxxer-because-she-has-read-too-many-books/)
--- who don't vaccinate their kids and promote their choices. Most
infamously, Jenny McCarthy has espoused her antivaccination position
because she believes vaccines are full of toxins and cause autism. When
she recently posed a question on Twitter about finding a mate, the
[vaccination
backlash](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/03/17/jenny_mccarthy_antivaxxer_gets_remedied_on_twitter.html)
was loud and clear. Just how harmful are these notions, though? Below
are [some preventable diseases making a vicious return thanks to people
not getting their
[vaccinations](http://healthland.time.com/2014/03/04/nothing-not-even-hard-facts-can-make-anti-vaxxers-change-their-minds/).
**Measles** According to the CDC, for every 1,000 children who get the
measles, one or two will die. Currently, public-health workers are
worried about the situation in New York, but just in the past three
months, there have been reported cases of the disease in
[Massachusetts](http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/local_coverage/2014/02/dph_measles_traced_to_trader_joe_s_in_framingham),
[Illinois](http://tristatesradio.com/post/another-measles-case-mcdonough-county)
and
[California](http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_25230823/rare-case-measles-confirmed-san-mateo-county?source=pkg)]{.underline}.
The CDC [reports](http://www.cdc.gov/Features/Measles/) that from Jan. 1
to Feb. 28, 2014, 54 people in the U.S. have reported being infected
with measles. On average, there are about 60 cases reported in the U.S.
every year. Most people in the U.S. are vaccinated against the measles,
but since measles is still around in other countries, those who travel
outside of the U.S. can contract it if they are not vaccinated. New York
City has not been able to confirm the source of the disease. [**Mumps**
As recently as Monday, health officials
[confirmed](https://time.com/28055/mumps-outbreak-at-ohio-state-grows-to-23-cases/)
23 cases of mumps at Ohio State University. In 2011, there was a mumps
[outbreak on the University of California at Berkeley
campus](http://uhs.berkeley.edu/home/news/mumps.shtml), with 29 reported
cases confirmed by the CDC.]{.underline} The source of the outbreak was
thought to be an unvaccinated student who had spent time traveling in
Western Europe where there is still a presence of mumps. In 2013, a
slightly smaller outbreak of the disease broke out among students [at
Loyola University in
Maryland](http://www.medicaldaily.com/mumps-virus-outbreak-baltimores-loyola-university-244633).
The last major occurrence was in 2006, when there was a multistate
outbreak of 6,584 reported cases. Less than 20 cases a year was
[considered usual](http://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html#b) at the
time. **[Whooping Cough]{.underline}** Whooping-cough outbreaks are
thought to be spurred by waning immunity from the vaccine. However, a
2013
[study](http://healthland.time.com/2013/09/30/parents-not-vaccinating-kids-contributed-to-whooping-cough-outbreaks/)
published in the journal Pediatrics reports that California's worst
whooping-cough outbreak, which infected more than 9,000 people, was also
encouraged by a large number of kids who were unvaccinated. **[Chicken
Pox]{.underline}** In 2012, a county in Indiana experienced a [major
chicken-pox
outbreak](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/27/chickenpox-outbreak-largest-vigo-county-indiana_n_2199231.html)
of more than 80 cases, which was thought to start from an unvaccinated
child. The vaccine is 90% effective, so it's possible for people who
have been vaccinated to contract the disease.

#### **Pandemics cause extinction**

**Pamlin and Armstrong 15** -- Dennis Pamlin, Executive Project Manager,
Global Challenges Foundation, Stuart Armstrong, James Martin Research
Fellow, Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford Martin School & Faculty of
Philosophy, University of Oxford, 2015 ("Global Challenges: 12 Risks
that Threaten Human Civilization," *Global Challenges Foundation*,

http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/HON301/12-Risks-with-infinite-impact-full-report-1.pdf)

**[Infectious diseases have been one of the greatest causes of mortality
in history]{.underline}**. Unlike many other global challenges pandemics
have happened recently, as we can see where reasonably good data exist.
Plotting historic epidemic fatalities on a log scale reveals that these
tend to follow a power law; with a small exponent: many plagues have
been found to follow a power law with exponent 0.26.261 These kinds of
power laws are heavy-tailed262 to a significant degree.263 In
consequence most of the fatalities are accounted for by the top few
events.264 If this law holds for future pandemics as well,265 then the
majority of people who will die from epidemics will likely die from the
single largest pandemic. Most epidemic fatalities follow a power law,
with some extreme events -- such as the Black Death and Spanish 'Flu --
being even more deadly.267 There are other grounds for suspecting that
such a highimpact epidemic will have a greater probability than usually
assumed. All the features of an extremely devastating disease already
exist in nature: essentially incurable (Ebola268), nearly always fatal
(rabies269), extremely infectious (common cold270), and long incubation
periods (HIV271). [If a pathogen were to emerge that somehow combined
these features (and influenza has demonstrated antigenic shift, the
ability to combine features from different viruses272), its death toll
would be extreme]{.underline}. Many relevant features of the world have
changed considerably, making past comparisons problematic. The modern
world has better sanitation and medical research, as well as national
and supra-national institutions dedicated to combating diseases. Private
insurers are also interested in modelling pandemic risks.273 Set against
this [is the fact that modern transport and dense human population allow
infections to spread much more rapidly274, and there is the potential
for urban slums to serve as breeding grounds for
disease.275]{.underline} Unlike events such as nuclear wars, pandemics
would not damage the world's infrastructure, and initial survivors would
likely be resistant to the infection. And there would probably be
survivors, if only in isolated locations. [Hence **the risk of a
civilisation collapse would come from the ripple effect of the
fatalities and the policy responses. These would include political and
agricultural disruption as well as economic dislocation and damage to
the world's trade network (including the food trade).**]{.underline}

citing a report by British Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies,
Master of Science degree from the University of London
("Antibiotic-resistant diseases pose \'apocalyptic\' threat, top expert
says," *The Guardian*, January 23^rd^,
<https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jan/23/antibiotic-resistant-diseases-apocalyptic-threat>)

[Britain\'s most senior medical adviser has warned MPs that the rise in
drug-resistant diseases could trigger a national emergency comparable to
a catastrophic terrorist attack, pandemic flu or major coastal
flooding]{.underline}. [[Dame Sally
Davies](http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/category/chief-professional-officers/chief-medical-officer/),
the chief medical officer, said the threat from infections that are
resistant to frontline antibiotics was so serious that the issue should
be added to the government\'s [national risk register of civil
emergencies](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/national-risk-register)]{.underline}.
[She
described](http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=12365&wfs=true)
what she called [an \"apocalyptic scenario\" where people going for
simple operations in 20 years\' time die of routine infections \"because
we have run out of antibiotics]{.underline}\". The register was
established in 2008 to advise the public and businesses on national
emergencies that Britain could face in the next five years. The highest
priority risks on the latest register include a deadly flu outbreak,
catastrophic terrorist attacks, and major flooding on the scale of 1953,
the last occasion on which a national emergency was declared in the UK.
Speaking to MPs on the Commons science and technology committee, Davies
said she would ask the Cabinet Office to add antibiotic resistance to
the national risk register in the light of an annual report on
infectious disease she will publish in March. Davies declined to
elaborate on the report, but said its publication would coincide with a
government strategy to promote more responsible use of antibiotics among
doctors and the clinical professions. \"We need to get our act together
in this country,\" she told the committee. She told the Guardian:
\"\"[There are few public health issues of potentially greater
importance for society than antibiotic resistance. It means we are at
increasing risk of developing infections that cannot be treated -- but
resistance can be managed. \"That is why we will be publishing a new
cross-government strategy and action plan to tackle this issue in early
spring.\"]{.underline} The issue of drug resistance is as old as
antibiotics themselves, and arises when drugs knock out susceptible
infections, leaving hardier, resilient strains behind. The survivors
then multiply, and over time can become unstoppable with frontline
medicines. Some of the best known are so-called hospital superbugs such
as MRSA that are at the root of outbreaks among patients. \"In the past,
most people haven\'t worried because we\'ve always had new antibiotics
to turn to,\" said Alan Johnson, consultant clinical scientist at the
[Health Protection Agency](http://www.hpa.org.uk/). \"What has changed
is that the development pipeline is running dry. We don\'t have new
antibiotics that we can rely on in the immediate future or in the longer
term.\" Changes in modern medicine have exacerbated the problem by
making patients more susceptible to infections. For example, cancer
treatments weaken the immune system, and the use of catheters increases
the chances of bugs entering the bloodstream. \"[We are becoming
increasingly reliant on antibiotics in a whole range of areas of
medicine. If we don\'t have new antibiotics to deal with the problems of
resistance we see, we are going to be in serious trouble,\"]{.underline}
Johnson added. The supply of new antibiotics has dried up for several
reasons, but a major one is that drugs companies see greater profits in
medicines that treat chronic conditions, such as heart disease, which
patients must take for years or even decades. \"There is a broken market
model for making new antibiotics,\" Davies told the MPs. Davies has met
senior officials at the World
[Health](https://www.theguardian.com/society/health) Organisation and
her counterparts in other countries to develop a strategy to tackle
antibiotic resistance globally. [Drug
resistance](https://www.theguardian.com/society/drug-resistance) is
emerging in diseases across the board. Davies said 80% of gonorrhea was
now resistant to the frontline antibiotic tetracycline, and infections
were rising in young and middle-aged people. Multi-drug resistant TB was
also a major threat, she said. [Another worrying trend is the rise in
infections that are resistant to powerful antibiotics called
carbapenems, which doctors rely on to tackle the most serious
infections. Resistant bugs carry a gene variant that allows them to
destroy the drug. What concerns some scientists is that the gene variant
can spread freely between different kinds of bacteria, said
Johnson]{.underline}. Bacteria resistant to carbapenems were first
detected in the UK in 2003, when three cases were reported. The numbers
remained low until 2007, but have since leapt to 333 in 2010, with 217
cases in the first six months of 2011, according to the latest figures
from the HPA.

#### **It also overcomes burnout**

<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5295033/>)

**[Antibiotic resistance, prompted by the overuse of antimicrobial
agents, may arise from a variety of mechanisms, particularly horizontal
gene transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes, which is
often facilitated by biofilm formation]{.underline}**. The importance of
phenotypic changes seen in a biofilm, which lead to genotypic
alterations, cannot be overstated. [Irrespective of if the biofilm is
single microbe or polymicrobial, bacteria, protected within a biofilm
from the external environment, communicate through signal transduction
pathways (e.g., quorum sensing or two-component systems), leading to
global changes in gene expression, enhancing virulence, and expediting
the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. Thus, one must examine a
genetic change in virulence and resistance not only in the context of
the biofilm but also as inextricably linked pathologies.
Observationally, it is clear that increased virulence and the advent of
antibiotic resistance often arise almost simultaneously; however, their
genetic connection has been relatively ignored.]{.underline} Although
the complexities of genetic regulation in a multispecies community may
obscure a causative relationship, uncovering key genetic interactions
between virulence and resistance in biofilm bacteria is essential to
identifying new druggable targets, ultimately providing a drug discovery
and development pathway to improve treatment options for chronic and
recurring infection.

### Aff

#### Perm do both---the aff is key to challenge and separate the failures of psychoanalytic practices

**Spillers** 19**96** -- Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Professor
(Hortense, "\"All the Things You Could Be by Now If Sigmund Freud\'s
Wife Was Your Mother\": Psychoanalysis and Race" Critical Inquiry, Vol.
22, No. 4 (Summer, 1996), pp. 710-734)

Among all the things you could be by now if Sigmund Freud\'s wife were
your mother is someone who understands the dozens, the intricate
verboseness of America\'s inner city. The big mouth brag, as much a sort
of art form as a strategy of insult, the dozens takes the assaulted home
to the backbone by \"talking about\" his mama and daddy. It is a choice
weapon of defense and always changes the topic; bloodless, because it is
all wounding words and outrageous combinations of imagery, and
democratic, because anyone can play and be played, it outsmarts the Uzi
not that it is pleasant for all that-by re-siting (and \"reciting\"?)
the stress. The game of living, after all, is played between the ears,
up in the head. Instead of dispatching a body, one straightens its
posture, instead of offering up a body, one sends his word. It is the
realm of the ludic and the ludicrous that the late jazz bassist Charlie
Mingus was playing around in when he concocted, as if on the spot, the
title of the melody from which the title of this essay is borrowed.
[Responding to his own question \"What does it mean?\" that he poses to
himself on the recording, he follows along the lines of his own cryptic
signature, \"Nothing. It means nothing.\" And what he proceeds to
perform on the cut is certainly no thing we know. But that really is the
point to extend the realm of possibility for what might be known, and,
not unlike the dozens, we will not easily decide if it is
fun.]{.underline} [We traditionally understand the psychoanalytic in a
pathological register, and there must be a very real question as to
whether or not it remains psychoanalysis without its principal
features-a \"third ear,\" something like the \"fourth wall,\" or the
speech that unfolds in the pristinely silent arena of two star witnesses
a patient and he or she \"who is supposed to know.\"]{.underline} The
scene of assumptions is completed in the privileged relations of client
and doctor in the atmosphere of the confessional. [But my interest in
this ethical self-knowing wants to unhook the psychoanalytic hermeneutic
from its rigorous curative framework and try to recover it in a
free-floating realm of self-didactic possibility that might decentralize
and disperse the knowing one.]{.underline} [We might need help here, for
sure, but the uncertainty of where we\'d be headed virtually makes no
guarantee of that.]{.underline} Out here, the only music they are
playing is Mingus\'s or much like it, and I should think that it would
take a good long time to learn to hear it well.

#### All models are wrong- the standard is whack

James **Clear**, no date, \"All Models Are Wrong: How to Make Decisions
in an Imperfect World,\" https://jamesclear.com/all-models-are-wrong

[Even the best models of the world are imperfect. This insight is
important to remember if we want to learn how to make decisions and take
action on a daily basis.]{.underline} For example, consider the work of
Albert Einstein. During the ten year period from 1905 to 1915, Einstein
developed the general theory of relativity, which is one of the most
important ideas in modern physics. Einstein\'s theory has held up
remarkably well over time. For example, general relativity predicted the
existence of gravitational waves, which scientists finally confirmed in
2015---a full 100 years after Einstein originally wrote it down.
However, even Einstein\'s best ideas were imperfect. While general
relativity explains how the universe works in many situations, it breaks
down in certain extreme cases (like inside black holes). All Models Are
Wrong, Some are [Useful In 1976, a British statistician named George Box
wrote the famous line, "All models are wrong, some are useful." His
point was that we should focus more on whether something can be applied
to everyday life in a useful manner rather than debating endlessly if an
answer is correct in all cases]{.underline}. As historian Yuval Noah
Harari puts it, "Scientists generally agree that no theory is 100
percent correct. Thus, the real test of knowledge is not truth, but
utility. Science gives us power. The more useful that power, the better
the science." Even Einstein\'s work was not perfect in all cases, but it
has been incredibly useful---not just for increasing our understanding
of the world, but also for practical purposes. For example, the Global
Positioning Systems (GPS) used in your phone and in your car must take
the effects of relativity into account to deliver accurate directions.
Without general relativity, our navigation systems wouldn't be accurate.
How to Make Decisions in an Imperfect World What steps can we take to
[make decisions](https://jamesclear.com/decision-making), given that no
single way of looking at the world is accurate in all situations? One
approach is to develop a broad collection of frameworks for thinking
about the world. Some experts refer to each framework as a "[mental
model](https://jamesclear.com/feynman-mental-models)." Each mental model
is a way of thinking about the world. The more mental models you have,
the more tools you have in your thinking toolbox to make decisions. For
example, here are three ways of thinking about productivity: [The
2-Minute Rule](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating): If
something takes less than two minutes, do it now. The goal of this rule
is to help you stop procrastinating and take action. [The Ivy Lee
Method](https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee): Create a to-do list by writing
down the six most important things you need to accomplish tomorrow,
prioritizing those items, and working on them in order. The goal of this
method is to help you work on the most important things first. [The
Seinfeld
Strategy](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy):
Pick a new habit and draw an X on the calendar for each day you stick
with the behavior. The goal of this method is to help you maintain
consistency and keep your streak of good behavior alive. Are any of
these models perfect? Of course not. But if you combine them, then you
have a strategy that can help you take action right now (The 2-Minute
Rule), a strategy that can help you plan your day more effectively (The
Ivy Lee Method), and a strategy that can help you maintain consistency
in the long-run (The Seinfeld Strategy). [You need a [collection of
mental models](https://jamesclear.com/mental-models) because no single
framework can work in every situation.]{.underline}

#### PoMo's revolutionarily critical approach on science is well supported

Marcel **Kuntz**, 09-08-20**12**, \"The postmodern assault on science:
If all truths are equal, who cares what science has to say?,\" PubMed
Central (PMC), https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463968/

[The scientific method has been the guiding principle for investigating
natural phenomena, but postmodernist thought is starting to threaten the
foundations of the scientific approach. The rational, scientific view of
the world has been painstakingly built over millennia to guarantee that
research can have access to objective reality: the world, for science,
contains real objects and is governed by physical laws that existed
before our knowledge of these objects and laws. Science attempts to
describe the world independently of belief by seeking universal truths,
on the basis of observation, measurement and experimentation. The
postmodernist school of thought arose to question these assumptions,
postulating that claims about the existence of a real world---the
knowledge of which is attainable as an objective truth---have only been
relevant in Western civilization since the Enlightenment. In recent
decades, the movement has begun to question the validity of claims of
scientific truth, whether on the basis of their belonging to larger
cultural frames or through heavy criticism of the scientific method.
However, postmodernist thought has mostly gone unnoticed by scientists,
despite its growing importance in the twentieth century.]{.underline}
The origins of this 'deconstruction\' of the 'Enlightenment project\'
can be traced back to Friedrich Nietzsche, who was among the first to
question our ability to discern objective truth: "In so far as the word
'knowledge\' has any meaning, the world is knowable; but it is
interpretable otherwise, it has no meaning behind it, but countless
meanings" (The Will to Power, 1883--1888;
\[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463968/#b1)\]).
During the late twentieth century, postmodern philosophy picked up where
Nietzsche left off. In his book, Against Method(1975;
\[[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463968/#b2)\]),
philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend argued that the progress of
acquiring scientific knowledge is not governed by any useful and
universal methodological rules, and summarized this "epistemological
anarchy" as "anything goes". The concept of paradigm shift proposed by
Thomas Kuhn in his famous book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions
(1962;
\[[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463968/#b3)\]), has
also given weight to the critics of science and of its pretension to
understand reality. [If science is not a gradual process of accumulation
of knowledge, but rather subject to sudden "revolutions" that overwhelm
outdated theories, they argue, how can one trust scientific knowledge?
If, as according to Kuhn, scientific revolutions are also political
upheavals in scientific policy, it is easy to understand why Kuhn\'s
theory has attracted so much attention in a period that calls into
question the established political order in the Western world. The
rational, scientific view of the world has been painstakingly built over
millennia to guarantee that research can have access to objective
reality This 'deconstruction\' gained momentum when it was also adopted
in the realm of the sociology of science, particularly in the so-called
'strong programme\' belonging to a school of thought known as 'science
studies\']{.underline}
\[[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463968/#b4)\]. The
'strong programme\' or 'strong sociology\' was a reaction to previous
sociologies of science that had only been applied to failed or false
theories. 'Strong sociology\' claims that the existence of a scientific
community, bound together by allegiance to a shared paradigm, is a
prerequisite for scientific activity, and that as such, both 'true\' and
'false\' scientific theories should be treated equally, as both are the
result of social factors or conditions. Several deconstructionist
thinkers, such as Bruno Latour and Ian Hacking, have rejected the idea
that the concepts of science can be derived from a direct interaction
with natural phenomena independently of the social environment in which
we think about them. [The central goal of science, defining what is true
and what is false, becomes meaningless they argue, as its objectivity is
reduced to 'claims\' that are simply the expression of one culture---one
community---among many. Thus, all systems of thought are different
"constructs" of reality and all additionally have political connotations
and agendas.]{.underline}

#### Postmodernist thought exposes the flaws of science in an effective manner

Scotty **Hendricks,** 10-15-**2018,** (Chicago based writer for
BigThink) \"Is postmodernism really anti-science?,\" Big Think,
https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/is-postmodernism-really-anti-science\
[Postmodernism is often accused of being anti-everything. The questions
that postmodernists raise about objectivity put them on a collision
course with science. The problems of how postmodernism looks at science
remind us that not every critique can be applied to every
discipline]{.underline}.
[Postmodernism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/) is
often presented as an intellectual boogeyman out to destroy truth, the
west, movies, and everything we hold dear. In reality, it is a system
that originates in the work of a few French thinkers from about 50 years
ago. It is based around several ideas but is commonly said to be the
rejection of overarching narratives or universalized interpretations of
the world. This has led to many claims that Postmodernism is \"anti\"
everything we hold dear. In particular, [the claim that [postmodernism
is
anti-science](https://areomagazine.com/2016/11/30/post-modernisms-troubled-relationship-with-science/)
is a common one. The debates had during the [science
wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_wars) in the 1990\'s between
scientific realists and postmodernist thinkers over what science really
was and what its findings meant brought the idea to the popular
consciousness.]{.underline} More recently it has been a staple of Jordan
Peterson\'s lectures. While these debates have largely died off and
nobody in physics has changed their rhetoric as a result of them, the
idea that postmodernism is anti-scientific remains. The French
postmodernist Jacques Derrida as he appeared in 1982. His misuse of
scientific terms was criticized by many scientific thinkers. In a
general sense, it is not. No postmodernist is saying that your
smartphone shouldn\'t work or that it will only work inside of a
specific social construct. [They don\'t think science is a racket or
fundamentally evil. What many postmodernists do argue is that we should
be skeptical of claims of objectivity, absolute access to truth, or
overarching narratives. Science, which attempts to find objective facts
in an impartial way, was perhaps doomed to be the target of a postmodern
critique questioning what it does and how it is doing it. These
criticisms, which range from the reasonable to the absurd, are what
drive people to call postmodernism \"anti-science.\" Many postmodernists
have different ideas on the [philosophy of
science](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3463968/) than
most people]{.underline}. Some postmodernists look to [Thomas
Kuhn](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/) and his ideas on
\"paradigm shifts\" being a source of major advances in scientific
thinking. These shifts, which involve one way of looking at data taking
precedent over all others, are at least partially social in nature. This
has allowed for allegations of relativism, which Kuhn denied, and an
opening for postmodernists to question how social factors influence the
findings of science. Some of these thinkers have sincerely tried to
explore the sociology and politics of science. Others have tried to
examine how these things affect the truths scientists discover. They run
into trouble when they do this though, as the attempts to look at
scientific facts as social constructs or blame the problems of science
on the inherent biases of scientists often encounter issues compounded
by the failure of those philosophers to understand what they\'re looking
at. [The results are mixed. On the one hand, some of these critiques can
be well applied in the world of academia and work just as well for the
hard sciences as they do for the social sciences or
literature]{.underline}. For example, pointing out that our
understanding of woman\'s health was held back by the tendency to keep
women out of the medical field is accurate. The fact that power
structures can influence what gets studied is a fact demonstrated by
[history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysenkoism) \[i\]. Even today,
the need to pursue funding and ensure publication influences what gets
studied. [A recent
report](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/science/why-your-dna-is-still-uncharted-territory.html)
suggested that the most analyzed sections of the human genome are
studied to death by scientists trying to guarantee funding and
professional success while other areas are utterly ignored. The
postmodernists\' observations that the decision on what gets studied and
when isn\'t as free from special interests as we would like to imagine
is an important one. However, the goofy stories are far more numerous
than the sane ones. Postmodern thinkers often try to apply critiques
that work well on literature, ethics, and sociology to the hard sciences
with insane results. Same of them are so absurd as to be hilarious. Luce
Irigaray, a French philosopher, has a bizarre notion of why fluid
dynamics are not as well understood as the movement of solid objects.
This is explained in this translation of her ideas by Katherine Hales:
The privileging of solid over fluid mechanics, and indeed the inability
of science to deal with turbulent flow at all, (Irigaray) attributes to
the association of fluidity with femininity. Whereas men have sex organs
that protrude and become rigid, women have openings that leak menstrual
blood.... Although men, too, flow on occasion... this aspect of their
sexuality is not emphasized. It is the rigidity of the male organ that
counts, not its complicity in fluid flow. These idealizations are
reinscribed in mathematics, which conceives of fluids as laminated
planes and other modified solid forms. In the same way that women are
erased within masculinist theories and language, existing only as
not-men, so fluids have been erased from science, existing only as
not-solids. From this perspective it is no wonder that science has not
been able to arrive at a successful model for turbulence. The problem of
turbulent flow cannot be solved because the conceptions of fluids (and
of women) have been formulated so as necessarily to leave unarticulated
remainders.

#### Scientific models are based on flawed assumptions and research 

**Spencer 9** (Roy, former climatologist at NASA, "The MIT Global
Warming Gamble," May,
http://www.drroyspencer.com/2009/05/the-mit-global-warming-gamble/)

[Climate science took another step backward last week as a new study
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was
[announced](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2009/roulette-0519.html) which
claims global warming by 2100 will probably be twice as bad as the
United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has
predicted. The research team examined a range of possible climate
scenarios which combined various estimates of the sensitivity of the
climate system with a range of possible policy decisions to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions which (presumably) cause global
warming]{.underline}. Without policy action, the group's model runs
"indicate a median probability of surface warming of 5.2 degrees Celsius
by 2100, with a 90% probability range of 3.5 to 7.4 degrees". Since that
average rate of warming (about 0.5 deg. C per decade) is at least 2
times the observed rate of global-average surface temperature rise over
the last 30 years, this would require our current spate of no warming to
change into very dramatic and sustained warming in the near future. And
the longer Mother Nature waits to comply with the MIT group's demands,
the more severe the warming will have to be to meet their projections.
Of course, as readers of this web site will know, [the MIT results are
totally dependent upon the climate sensitivity that was assumed in the
climate model runs that formed the basis for their calculations. And
climate modelers can get just about any level of warming they want by
simply making a small change in the processes controlling climate
sensitivity -- especially cloud feedbacks --- in those
models]{.underline}. So, since the sensitivity of the climate system is
uncertain, these researchers followed the IPCC's lead of using
'statistical probability' as a way of treating that uncertainty. But as
I have mentioned before, [the use of statistical probabilities in this
context is inappropriate. There is a certain climate sensitivity that
exists in the real climate system, and it is true that we do not know
exactly what that sensitivity is. But this does not mean that our
uncertainty over its sensitivity can be translated into some sort of
statistical probability]{.underline}. The use of statistical
probabilities by the IPCC and the MIT group does two misleading things:
(1) it implies scientific precision where none exists, and (2) it
implies the climate system's response to any change is a "roll of the
dice". We know what the probability of rolling a pair of sixes with dice
is, since it is a random event which, when repeated a sufficient number
of times, will reveal that probability (1 in 36). But in contrast to
this simple example, there is instead a particular climate sensitivity
that exists out there in the real climate system. The endless
fascination with playing computer games to figure out that climate
sensitivity, in my opinion, ends up wasting a lot of time and money.
True, there are many scientists who really do think our tinkering with
the climate system through our greenhouse gas emissions is like playing
Russian roulette. But the climate system tinkers with itself all the
time, and the climate has managed to remain stable. [There are indeed
internal, chaotic fluctuations in the climate system that might appear
to be random, but their effect on the whole climate system are
constrained to operate within a certain range. If the climate system
really was that sensitive, it would have forced itself into oblivion
long ago.]{.underline} The MIT research group pays lip service to
relying on "peer-reviewed science", but it looks like they treat
peer-reviewed scientific publications as random events, too. If 99
papers have been published which claim the climate system is VERY
sensitive, but only 1 paper has been published that says the climate
system is NOT very sensitive, is there then a 99-in-100 (99%) chance
that the climate system is very sensitive? NO. [As has happened
repeatedly in all scientific disciplines, it is often a single research
paper that ends up overturning what scientists thought they knew about
something.]{.underline} In climate research, those 99 papers typically
will all make the same assumptions, which then pretty much guarantees
they will end up arriving at the same conclusions. So, those 99 papers
do not constitute independent pieces of evidence. **[Instead, they might
be better described as evidence that 'group think' still exists. It
turns out that the belief in a sensitive climate is not because of the
observational evidence, but in spite of it.]{.underline}** You can start
to learn more about the evidence for low climate sensitivity (negative
feedbacks)
[here](http://www.drroyspencer.com/2009/05/climate-model-predictions-it%E2%80%99s-time-for-a-reality-check/).
As the slightly-retouched photo of the MIT research group shown above
suggests, I predict that it is only a matter of time before the climate
community placing all its bets on the climate models is revealed to be a
very bad gamble.

## Other cards

### AT: Lundberg

#### Their ONLY card is backwards -here's their 2AC author which states that the role of rhetoric in psychoanalysis makes it useful. 

**Lundberg 12** (Christian, B.A., University of Redlands; Master of
Divinity, Emory University; Ph.D., Northwestern University,
Communication Studies. co-Director of the University Program in Cultural
Studies at UNC, "Lacan in Public: Psychoanalysis and the Science of
Rhetoric," University of Alabama Press, part of the series Rhetoric,
Culture, and Social Critique, 2012)

One of the most hallowed maxims of rhetorical studies is that rhetoric
is an art--- a techne for engaging discourse in the properly
Aristotelian sense of the term. Techne implies a systematic mode of
experiential knowledge, but of­ ten in declaring that rheto­ r ic is an
art, the accent of this declaration falls on the intuitive and the
experiential facets of techne at the expense of the more sys­ tematic
charge inherent in it. While for much of the rhe­ tori­ cal tradition,
techne has primarily taken the valence of a prudential guide for
intuitive judgment, Lacan turns to rhetoric to confer on psychoanalysis
a scientific status. [Lacan's claims to the "science" of rhetoric
respond to a number of critics who had framed psychoanalysis as an
alchemical mix of unfounded theories, intuitions and inherited
practices]{.underline}. Borrowing from Karl Popper's philosophy of
science, such critiques of psycho­ analy­ sis argued that analytic
practice was non-­ falsifiable, resting on the idea that no empirical
evidence could be mustered to refute it. Any claim to evidence to the
contrary of Freudian theories could always be elided by generating
another explanation with dubious empirical grounding to account for
potential exceptions. [In drawing on rhetoric as a systematic mode for
theorizing the nature of the sign, representation, and the logic and
social functions of discourse, Lacan rescues Freudian categories from
non-­ falsifiability. Rhetoric, which is so squarely rooted in "art,"
became one of Lacan's most powerful allies in articulating psycho­ analy­
sis as a science, providing a vocabulary for attending to the repeatable
elements of signification that might be held up to empirical
verification]{.underline}. Lacan vacillated at different points in his
career on psycho­ analy­ sis's status as a science, arguing at points that
it was clearly a science, at others that it was not, and at others that
it was a special kind of science. 61 Generally, Lacan's early career
embodied the strongest claim for the scientific status of psycho­ analy­
sis, while in his later career he became less invested in the idea,
arguing that it need not attempt to assume scientific status to validate
itself. 62 What is most interesting about the ambivalence toward science
in Lacan's thought is that at each instance where the relationship
between psycho­analy­ sis and science is at stake, the question of rheto­ r
ic is never far from the conversation. For example, in The Psychoses and
The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanaly­sis, [Lacan argues that
psychoanalysis is a science on the basis of its attention to a set of
repeatable logi­ cal forms, specifically to trope as a way of specifying
the possible connections underwriting discursive and representational
practices]{.underline}. Other accounts read Lacan as eventually giving
up on the idea that psycho­ analy­ sis is a science, 0but do so, once
again, with explicit reference to rhetoric. For example, Stuart
Schneiderman argues that by 1977 Lacan had given up the quest to prove
psycho­ analy­ sis as a science, that "after having posed the question of
the scientific status of psycho­ analy­ sis for so many years, he had come
to the conclusion that it was not a science. The reason was one offered
by Karl Popper, namely that psycho­ analy­ sis was 'irrefutable.' Lacan
said that analysis was closest to rhetoric. . . . Thus analy­ sis seeks
to persuade but not convince, to persuade the analysand to recognize
things that he knows already and to act on his desire." 63 Of course,
one might take issue with the account of rheto­ r ic that is implicit in
this claim, particularly on the grounds that the framing of rheto­ r ic
in [Schneiderman's account affirms an understanding of rhetoric
exclusively through reference to persuasion, contingency, and
probability--- a conception that is]{.underline}, as I have been
arguing, [at odds with Lacan's understanding of]{.underline} the work
[of rhetoric. More accurately, rhetoric affords Lacanian psychoanalysis
a status as a special kind of science by providing it with a set of
techniques for paying attention to the mathematical qualities of
discourse.]{.underline} Regardless of how one understands the moniker
"science," [rhetoric drives psychoanalysis toward a systematic account
of the possible modes of connection that animate actually existing
discourses, and toward an observation of the concrete functions of trope
in the social life of the subject.]{.underline}

### Neuroscience

#### Neuroscience can't justify the unconscious, desire or psychoanalysis

Johannes **Lehtonen 13**, professor of psychiatry emeritus, University
of Kuopio, Scandinavian Psychoanalytic Review, \"At the crossroads of
psychoanalysis and neuroscience\", January 21,
www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01062301.2012.10592376

However, with a lack of available concepts or a grammar of how to create
and use the bridging tools, a dialogue between disciplines with
different premises and concepts cannot be easy. For a successful
dialogue to emerge, understanding of the language of both par- ticipants
is a necessity. A living grammar is required to connect the languages of
both fields and to avoid confusion. Its creation is. to express it
diminutively, not a small challenge.¶ [Neuroscience cannot prove
psychoanalysis to be correct. However, when coherence between the
findings of the two fields is shown, neuroscience may strengthen the
credibility of psychoanalytical theory.]{.underline} The criterion for
this, then, is that meaningfulness can be seen to prevail in the
connection of the findings within these two fields, even though the
connections arc in a strict sense not causal, as they always require
interpretation of their meaning.¶ The history of psychoanalysis is a
history of diverging schools of psychoanalytic thought. Psychoanalysis
scarcely needs new schools of thought, which is what the development of
neuro-psychoanalysis might lead to. [In assessing the meaning of
neuroscience to psychoanalysis, it is important to stress the mutuality
of their cooperation and not surrender to a misleading impression of
their merging with one another. Psychoanalysis needs a conception of
mental reality based on its own observations and concepts of the
unconscious and conscious, presymbolic and symbolic nature of the mind,
which cannot be replaced by paradigms of experimental
research]{.underline} (see, c.g.. von Wright. 1971: EnckelK H. 2002.
2010).¶ Although recent information-theoretical models of the human mind
may have narrowed the gap between these two paradigms {Sun ct al..
2009). [neurocognitive models have not changed either the symbolic or
the presymbolic nature of the symbiosis of human relations]{.underline}
or the differences prevailing between them and experimental models. A
crucial question in the dialogue between neuroscience and psychoanalysis
is whether a real benefit is gained from their interactions. New
concepts or denotations, such as neuro-psychoanalysis do not create a
new reality. They do so only if they truly widen the understanding of
the mind.

**Neuroscience disproves the death drive**

The compulsion to repeat self‐destructive experiences must continue to
be studied within a more comprehensive epistemological framework that
includes other sciences, such as evolutionary and cognitive
psychologies. This inclusion will reduce our isolation within the
scientific community and will grant our theories increasing external
validity ([Kernberg,
2006b](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00121.x#b89)).
In this sense, I think we must incorporate into our notion of the nature
of mental functioning the idea that [our mind does not function solely
on the basis of our emotional experiences starting at birth. Rather, it
does so according to an adaptive survival program]{.underline} ([Langs,
1996](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00121.x#b101))
[developed over six million years of hominid evolution]{.underline}
(Science, 2004). From this evolutionary perspective, [it seems less than
likely that a death drive may have evolved into a universal species
trait]{.underline}[16](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00121.x#fn16)

Furthermore, the model of brain functioning suggested by Freud does not
have many characteristics in common with the one discovered by current
neuroscience. Freud conjectured the tendency of the nervous system
towards eliminating the tension or reducing it to the lowest level
possible (the 'principle of inertia'). [We now know that the brain is
always active and that it does not have the tendency towards reducing
its activity to this state of almost absolute passiveness. Therefore,
the economic principle that formed the basis of the existence of a death
drive would be wrong]{.underline} ([Coderch,
2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00121.x#b500)).
Just as we accept the idea of an innate language module ([Chomsky,
1975](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00121.x#b24);
[Pinker,
1994](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00121.x#b127)),
evolutionary psychology advances the hypothesis of the presence of an
innate mental module that constantly assesses the cost‐benefit relation
of every human interaction ([Cosmides,
1989](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00121.x#b26)).
How can we explain the fact that Alex never missed a session despite the
suffering he experienced in his treatment if his mind were not actively
recognizing a benefit to his survival? I do not intend to offer answers.
Rather, I would like to raise new questions in keeping with the
philosophical and scientific foundations of current research into the
mind. That, and no other, was Freud's way. I believe that
destructiveness is rooted in the high complexity reached by the human
mind. Such complexity generates infinite emotional experiences,
unbearable on occasion. If these are not contained and channelled,
transformed and worked through by consistent psychic structures, they
give rise to loss of control, dissociations, projections and
evacuations, with ordinary and extraordinary destructive results. We
might resort to the following metaphor: overall, the destructive effects
of Katrina did not depend on the force of the hurricane but on the
fragility of New Orleans' levees. Psychic structures set the course for
human beings' drive dimension. The earthquake metaphor may contribute to
our understanding of human beings' self‐destructive functioning. Like
the Earth through its tectonic movements, the psyche seeks a state of
stability that will free it from the high tension it normally endures.
Tectonic movements, in turn, may have very destructive effects on the
surface: those predicted for the West coast of the United States or, in
the case of the mind, the elimination of a significant part of the life
development of schizoid subjects caused by their inclination to isolate
themselves[. I do not think that mental functioning contains a tendency
that is lethal per se -- a tendency toward an inorganic state of
absolute stability. I do believe that there is a tendency to avoid the
unpleasure caused by overwhelming excitations, and this tendency, like
tectonic movements, may occasionally become destructive.]{.underline}

### No Death Drive

#### Death drive doesn't explain the root cause of violence

West of England, "Life and Death in Freud and Heidegger", Google Books

Secondly, the constancy principle on which these ideas are based is
incompatible with observational data. Once the passive model of the
nervous system has been discarded, there was no need for external
excitation in order for discharge to take place, and more generally,
\"the behavioural picture seemed to negate the notion of drive, as a
separate energizer of behaviour\" {Hcbb. 1982. p.35). According to Holt,
[the nervous system is not passive; it does not take in and conduct out
energy from the environment, and it shows no tendency to discharge its
impulses. \'The principle of constancy is quite without any biological
basis\"]{.underline} (1965, p. 109). He goes on to present the
difficulties that arise from the pleasure principle as linked to a
tension-reduction theory. The notion of tension is \"conveniently
ambiguous\": it has phenomenological, physiological and abstract
meaning. But empirical evidence against the theory of tension reduction
has been \"mounting steadily\" and any further attempts to link pleasure
with a reduction of physiological tension are \"decisively refuted\"
(1965, pp. 1102). Additionally, the organism and the mental system are
no longer considered closed systems. So the main arguments for the
economic view collapse, as does the entropic argument for the death
drive (1965, p. 114). A final, more general criticism of Freud\'s
economic theory is sounded by Compton, who argues, \"Freud fills in
psychological discontinuities with neurological hypotheses\" (1981, p.
195). **[The Nirvana principle is part and parcel of the economic view
and the incomplete and erroneous assumptions about the nervous system
(Hobson, 1988, p.277). It is an extension ad extremis of the pleasure
principle, and as such is vulnerable to all the above criticisms. The
overall contemporary view provides strong support for discarding the
Nirvana principle and reconstructing the death drive as
aggression.]{.underline}**

#### Death drive is incorrect

**[No clinical argument constitutes proof of the existence of the death
drive.]{.underline}** Clinical pictures may be interpreted in manifold
ways and cannot be considered a direct expression of drive functioning
([Green,

[We cannot undervalue the destructiveness that often characterizes the
compulsion to repeatthat underlies the phenomena described by Freud in
1920]{.underline} (transference, post‐traumatic dreams, the reel game).
Nonetheless, such compulsion is not necessarily tied to the demonic.
Numerous psychoanalysts have stressed its role in relation to mastery.
It might represent the preservation of something that has been achieved,
or a necessary factor to maintain identity ([Lichtenstein,
1961](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00121.x#b106)).

(1953)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00121.x#b99),
based on the Zeigarnik effect, we find a plausible explanation for this
compulsion: what is repeated is a need; there is no primal need to
repeat. [What is repeated is the need to finish the task, to close the
structure. In transference repetition, the underlying desire is to
complete something that was left incomplete; to close a structure that
had remained open; to seek a solution for unsettled issues. **Unresolved
problems emerging in the transference concern decisive developmental
stages and require an object relation for their
resolution**]{.underline} (Etchegoyen, 1986).

#### Small reforms are key to pragmatic change 

Erik Olin **Wright 7**, Vilas Distinguished Professor of Sociology at
the University of Wisconsin, "Guidelines for Envisioning Real Utopias",
Soundings, April,
www.ssc.wisc.edu/\~wright/Published%20writing/Guidelines-soundings.pdf

[The final guideline for discussions of envisioning real utopias
concerns the importance of waystations. The central problem of
envisioning real utopias concerns the viability of institutional
alternatives that embody emancipatory values, but the practical
achievability of such institutional designs often depends upon the
existence of smaller steps, intermediate institutional innovations that
move us in the right direction but only partially embody these
values.]{.underline} [Institutional proposals which have an
all-or-nothing quality to them are both less likely to be adopted in the
first place, and may pose more difficult transition-cost problems if
implemented]{.underline}. The catastrophic experience of Russia in the
"shock therapy" approach to market reform is historical testimony to
this problem.¶ Waystations are a difficult theoretical and practical
problem because there are many instances in which partial reforms may
have very different consequences than full- bodied changes. Consider the
example of unconditional basic income. Suppose that a very limited,
below-subsistence basic income was instituted: not enough to survive on,
but a grant of income unconditionally given to everyone. One possibility
is that this kind of basic income would act mainly as a subsidy to
employers who pay very low wages, since now they could attract more
workers even if they offered below poverty level¶ earnings. There may be
good reasons to institute such wage subsidies, but they would not
generate the positive effects of a UBI, and therefore might not function
as a stepping stone.¶ What we ideally want, therefore, are intermediate
reforms that have two main properties: first, they concretely
demonstrate the virtues of the fuller program of transformation, so they
contribute to the ideological battle of convincing people that the
alternative is credible and desirable; and second, they enhance the
capacity for action of people, increasing their ability to push further
in the future. [Waystations that increase popular participation and
bring people together in problem-solving deliberations for collective
purposes are particularly salient in this regard.]{.underline} This is
what in the 1970s was called "nonreformist reforms": **[reforms that are
possible within existing institutions and that pragmatically solve real
problems while at the same time empowering people in ways which enlarge
their scope of action in the future.]{.underline}**

[Ritualized homosexuality must be compared with a certain form of
ritualized cannibalism practised in various cultures where (as with
homosexuality) cannibalism does not exist at ordinary
times.]{.underline} In both cases, so it seems to me, the instinctual
appetite, whether it be for food or sex, becomes fixated on the person
or persons who are quarreling. As always, desire tends to be inflected
toward the mimetic model. In cannibalism, the rivalry must originally be
over food. Within the alimentary context, the growing obsession that the
model creates can be translated into an irresistible tendency to see him
as something good to eat. [Within the sexual context, the same obsession
can be translated into an irresistible tendency to see him as a possible
object for sexual intercourse.]{.underline}

[Zizek does not offer much by way of a positive social agenda. He does
not have anything approximating to a \'programme\', nor a model of the
kind of society he seeks, nor a theory of the construction of
alternatives in the present]{.underline}. [Indeed, the more one looks at
the matter, the more difficult it becomes to pin Zizek down to any
\'line\' or \'position\'.]{.underline} He seems at first sight to regard
social transformation, not as something \'possible\' to be theorised and
advanced, but as a fundamental \'impossibility\' because the influence
of the dominant symbolic system is so great that it makes alternatives
unthinkable.15 A fundamental transformation, however, is clearly the
only answer to the vision of contemporary crisis Zizek offers[. Can he
escape this contradiction? His attempt to do so revolves around a
reclassification of \'impossibility\' as an active element in generating
action. Asserting or pursuing the impossible becomes in Zizek\'s account
not only possible but desirable.]{.underline} So how then can the left
advance its \'impossible\' politics? How is a now \'impossible\' model
of class struggle be transformed into a politics relevant to the present
period?

### Extra/recut

#### Threats aren't psychological projections 

Stanley **Hoffman 86**, Center for European Studies at Harvard,  "On the
Political Psychology of Peace and War: A Critique and an
Agenda," *Political Psychology* 7.1 JSTOR

The traditionalists, even when, in their own work, they try
scrupulous-ly to transcend national prejudices and to seek scientific
truth, believe that it is unrealistic to expect statesmen to stand above
the fray: By definition, the statesmen are there to worry not only about
planetary survival, but --- first of all---about national survival and
safety. To be sure, they ought to be able to see how certain policies,
aimed at enhancing security, actually increase in-security all around.
But there are sharp limits to how far they can go in their mutual
empathy or in their acts (unlike intellectuals in their advice), as long
as the states\' antagonisms persist, as long as uncertainty about each
other\'s intentions prevails, and as long as there is reason to fear
that one side\'s wise restraint, or unilateral moves toward \"sanity,\"
will be met, not by the rival\'s similar restraint or moves, but either
by swift or skillful political or military exploitation of the
opportunity created for unilateral gain, or by a for-midable domestic
backlash if national self-restraint appears to result in ex-ternal
losses, humiliations or perceptions of weakness. There is little point
in saying that the state of affairs which imposes such limits is
\"anachronistic\" or \"unrational.\" To traditionalists, the radicals\'
stance --- condemnation from the top of Mount Olympus --- can only
impede understanding of the limits and possibilities of reform. To be
sure, the fragmentation of mankind is a formidable obstacle to the
solution of many problems that cannot be handled well in a national
framework, and a deadly peril insofar as the use of force, the very
distinctive feature of world politics, now entails the risk of nuclear
war. But one can hardly call anachronistic a phenomenon---the assertion
of national identity --- that, to the bulk of \[HU\]mankind, appears not
only as a necessity but also as a positive good, since humanity\'s
fragmentation results from the very aspiration to self-determination.
Many people have only recently emerged from foreign mastery, and have
reason to fear that the alternative to national self-mastery is not a
world government of assured fairness and efficiency, but alien
domination. As for \"unrationality,\" the drama lies in the contrast
between the ra-tionality of the whole, which scholars are concerned
about---the greatest good of the greatest number, in utilitarian terms
--- and the rationality or greatest good of the part, which is what
statesmen worry about and are responsible for. What the radicals
denounce as irrational and irresponsible from the viewpoint of mankind
is what Weber called the statesman\'s ethic of responsibility. What
keeps ordinary \"competitive conflict processes\" (Deutsch, 1983)--- the
very stuff of society --- from becoming \"unrational\" or destructive,
is precisely what the nature of world politics excludes: the restraint
of the partners either because of the ties of affection or
responsibility that mitigate the conflict, or because of the existence
of an outsider --- marriage counselor, arbitrator, judge, policeman or
legislator--- capable of inducing or imposing restraints. Here we come
to a third point of difference. The very absence of such safeguards of
rationality, the obvious discrepancy between what each part intends, and
what it (and the whole world) ends with, the crudeness of some of the
psychological mechanisms at work in international affairs---as one can
see from the statements of leaders, or from the media, or from inflamed
publics---have led many radicals, especially among those whose training
or profession is in psychoanalysis or mental health, to treat the
age-old contests of states in terms, not of the psychology of politics,
but of individual psychology and pathology. There are two manifestations
of this. One is the tendency to look at nations or states as individuals
writ large, stuck at an early stage of development (similarly, John Mack
(1985) in a recent paper talks of political ideologies as carrying
\"forward the dichotomized structures of childhood\"). One of my
predecessors writes about \"the correspondence between development of
the individual self and that of the group or nation,\" and concludes
\"that intergroup or international conflict contains the basic elements
of the conflict each individual experiences psychologically\" (Volkan,
1985). Robert Holt, from the viewpoint of cognitive psychology, finds
\"the largest part of the American public\" immature, in a \"phase of
development below the Conscientious\" (Holt, 1984). The second related
aspect is the tendency to look at the notions statesmen or publics have
of \"the enemy,\" not only as residues of childhood or adolescent phases
of development, but as images that express \"disavowed aspects of the
self\" (Stein, 1985), reveal truths about our own fears and hatreds, and
amount to masks we put on the \"enemy,\" because of our own
psychological needs. Here is where the clash between traditionalists and
radicals is strongest. Traditionalists do not accept a view of group
life derived from the study of individual development or family
relations, or a view of modern society derived from the simplistic
Freudian model of regressed followers identifying with a leader. They
don\'t see in ideologies just irra-tional constructs, but often
rationally selected maps allowing individuals to cope with reality. They
don\'t see national identification as pathological, as an appeal to the
people\'s baser instincts, more aggressive impulses or un-sophisticated
mental defenses; it is, as Jean-Jacques Rousseau so well understood, the
competition of sovereign states that frequently pushes people from
\"sane\" patriotism to \"insane\" nationalism (Rousseau\'s way of
preventing the former from veering into the latter was, to say the
least, im-practical: to remain poor in isolation). Nor do they see
anything \"primitive\" in the nation\'s concern for survival: It is a
moral and structural requirement. Traditionalists also believe that the
\"intra-psychic\" approach distorts reality. Enemies are not mere
projections of negative identities; they are often quite real. To be
sure, the Nazis\' view of the Jews fits the metaphor of the mask put on
the enemy for one\'s own needs. But were, in return, those Jews who
understood what enemies they had in the Nazis, doing the same? Is the
Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, is the Soviet regime\'s treatment
of dissidents, was the Gulag merely a convenient projection of our
intrapsychic battles? Clichés such as the one about how our enemy
\"understands only force\" may tell us a great deal about ourselves; but
sometimes they contain half-truths about him, and not just revelations
about us. Our fears flow not only from our private fantasies but also
from concrete realities and from the fantasies which the international
state of nature generates. In other words, the psychology of politics
which traditionalists deem adequate is not derived from theories of
psychic development and health; it is derived from the logic of the
international milieu, which breeds the kind of vocabulary found in the
historians and theorists of the state of nature: fear and power, pride
and honor, survival and security, self-interest and reputation, distrust
and misunderstanding, commitment and credibility. It is also derived
from the social psychology of small or large groups, which resorts to
the standard psychological vocabulary that describes mental mechanisms
or maneuvers and cognitive processes: denial, projection, guilt,
repression, closure, rigidity, etc\.... But using this vocabulary does
not imply that a group whose style of politics is paranoid is therefore
composed of people who, as private individuals, are paranoid. Nor does
it relieve us of the duty to look at the objective reasons and functions
of these mental moves, and of the duty to make explicit our assumptions
about what constitutes a \"healthy,\" wise, or proper social process.
Altogether, traditionalists find the mental health approach to world
affairs unhelpful. Decisions about war and peace are usually taken by
small groups of people; the temptation of analyzing their behavior
either, literal-ly, in terms of their personalities, or, metaphysically,
in terms borrowed from the study of human development, rather than in
those of group dynamics or principles of international politics is
understandable. But it is misleading. What is pathological in couples,
or in a well-ordered community, is, alas, frequent, indeed normal, among
states, or in a troubled state. What is malignant or crazy is usually
not the actors or the social process in which they are engaged: it is
the possible results. The grammar of motives which the mental health
approach brands as primitive or immature is actually rational for the
actors. Traditionalists fear that this particular approach leads to the
substitution of labels for explanations, to bad analysis and fanciful
prescriptions. Bad analysis: the tendency to see in group coherence a
regressive response to a threat, whereas it often is a rational response
to the \"existential\" threats entailed by the very nature of the
international milieu. Or the tendency to see in the effacement or
minimization of individual differences in a group a release of
unconscious instincts, rather than a phenomenon that can be perfectly
adaptive---in response to stress or threats---or result from
governmental manipulation or originate in the code of conduct inculcated
by the educational system, etc.. . The habit of comparing the state, or
modern society, with the Church or the army, and to analyze human
relations in these institutions in ways that stress the libidinal more
than the cognitive and superego factors, or equate libidinal bonds and
the desire for a leader. The view that enemies are above all products of
mental drives, rather than inevitable concomitants of social strife at
every level. Or the view that the contest with the rival fulfills
inter-nal needs, which may be true, but requires careful examination of
the nature of these needs (psychological? bureaucratic? economic?),
obscures the objective reasons of the contest, and risks confusing cause
and function. Indeed, such analysis is particularly misleading in
dealing with the pre-sent scene. The radicals are so (justifiably)
concerned with the nuclear peril that the traditional ways in which
statesmen and publics behave seem to vindicate the pathological
approach. But this, in turn, incites radicals to overlook the
fundamental ambiguity of contemporary world politics. On the one hand,
there is a nuclear revolution---the capacity for total destruction. On
the other hand, many states, without nuclear weapons, find that the use
of force remains rational (in terms of a rationality of means) and
beneficial at home or abroad---ask the Vietnamese, or the Egyptians
after October 1973, or Mrs. Thatcher after the Falklands, or Ronald
Reagan after Grenada. The superpowers themselves, whose contest has not
been abolished by the nuclear revolution (it is the stakes, the costs of
failure that have, of course, been transformed), find that much of their
rivalry can be conducted in traditional ways --- including limited uses
of force ---below the level of nuclear alarm. They also find that
nuclear weapons, while---perhapsunusable rationally, can usefully
strengthen the very process that has been so faulty in the prenuclear
ages: deterrence (this is one of the reasons for nuclear proliferation).
The pathological approach interprets deterrence as expressing the
deterrer\'s belief that his country is good, the enemy\'s is bad. This
is often the case, but it need not be; it can also reflect the
conviction that one\'s country has interests that are not mere figments
of the imagination, and need to be protected both because of the
material costs of losing them, and because of the values embedded in
them. As for war planning, it is not a case of \"psychological denial of
unwelcome reality\" (Montville, 1985). but a --- perhaps futile, perhaps
dangerous---necessity in a world where deterrence may once more fail.
The prescriptions that result from the radicals\' psychological approach
also run into traditionalist objections. Even if one accepts the
metaphors of collective disease or pathology, one must understand that
the \"cure\" can only be provided by politics. All too often, the
radicals\' cures consist of perfectly sensible recommendations for
lowering tensions, but fail to tell us how to get them carried out
---they only tell us how much better the world would be, if only \"such
rules could be established\" (Deutsch, 1983). Sometimes, they express
generous aspirations --- for common or mutual security---without much
awareness of the obstacles which conflict-ing interests, fears about
allies or clients, and the nature of the weapons themselves, continue to
erect. Sometimes, they too neglect the ambiguity of life in a nuclear
world: The much lamented redundancy of weapons, a calamity if nuclear
deterrence fails, can also be a cushion against failure. Finally, many
of the remedies offered are based on an admirable liberal model of
personality and politics: the ideal of the mature, well-adjusted,
open-minded person (produced by liberal education and healthy family
relations) transposed on the political level, and thus accompanied by
the triumph of democracy in the community, by the elimination of
militarism and the spread of functional cooperation abroad. But three
obstacles remain unconquered: first, a major part of the world rejects
this ideal and keeps itself closed to it (many of the radicals seem to
deny it, or to ignore it, or to believe it doesn\'t matter). Second, the
record shows that real democracies, in their behavior toward
non-democratic or less \"advanced\" societies, do not conform to the
happy model (think of the US in Central America). Third, the task of
reform, both of the publics and of the statesmen, through consciousness
raising and education is hopelessly huge, incapable of being pursued
equally in all the important states, and --- indeed --- too slow if one
accepts the idea of a mortal nuclear peril. These, then, are the
dimensions of a split that should not be minimized or denied.
