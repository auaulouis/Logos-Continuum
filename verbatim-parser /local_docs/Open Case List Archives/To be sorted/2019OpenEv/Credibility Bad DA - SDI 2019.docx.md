#### US non-prolif cred is [low]{.underline} -- plan [unlocks Trump's arms control agenda]{.underline}

The second major benefit of [[reducing arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark}
is that it [[would imbue the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} **[greater [moral
authority]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Today, [[as the leading]{.mark}
arms-[dealing nation]{.mark} in the world, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[lacks credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in discussions of arms
control and nonproliferation]{.underline}, especially in light of its
military interventionism since 2001. [[By showing the
world]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[it is ready to choose
diplomacy]{.mark} over the arms trade, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[would provide **a huge boost to international efforts to curtail
proliferation**]{.underline}]{.mark} and its negative consequences.
[This is important because [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has pursued **and will**]{.mark} **continue to
[pursue]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[a]{.mark} wide [range of]{.mark} arms
control and [nonproliferation objectives]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
United States is a signatory of treaties dealing with weapons of mass
destruction, missile technology, land mines, and cluster munitions, not
to mention the flow of conventional weapons of all kinds. The
[[**effectiveness** of]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[treaties,
and]{.mark} **the ab[ility to create more]{.mark} effective and
enduring** arms control and nonproliferation frameworks]{.underline},
however, [[**depends on how** the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[behaves]{.underline}]{.mark}.

This is not to say that unilateral American action will put an end to
the problems of the global arms trade. States would still seek to ensure
their security and survival through deterrence and military strength.
Other weapons suppliers would, in the short run, certainly race to meet
the demand. But [[history shows]{.underline}]{.mark} that [global
[nonproliferation treaties]{.mark} and weapons bans]{.underline}
typically **[[require great-power support.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In
1969, for example, Richard Nixon decided to shutter the American
offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international ban on
such weapons. By 1972 [the **[B]{.mark}**]{.underline}iological
**[[W]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**onvention
passed [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} has since been signed by 178
nations.98 In 1991 President George H. W. Bush unilaterally renounced
the use of chemical weapons. By 1993 the United States had signed the
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hemical **[[W]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**onvention, which now has 192 signatories.99
Both of these efforts [[succeeded]{.underline}]{.mark} in part
[**[because]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [took
decisive early action in the absence of any promises about how others
would respond.]{.underline}100 **[[Without U.S. leadership, any
effort]{.mark} to limit proliferation of major conventional weapons and
dangerous emerging technologies [is likely to
fail.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Trump's agenda centers on [opposing commercial nuclear development]{.underline}, [stringent nonproliferation standards of supply]{.underline}, and eliminating [enrichment and reprocessing]{.underline} -- [collapses the NPT]{.underline} and [guarantees proliferation]{.underline}

**Siegel 19** \-\-\-- Jonas, associate director at the Center for
International and Security Studies (University of Maryland), former
editor of the *Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists*, "Nuclear Energy
\'Cooperation,\' With A Twist," *The Hill*, 5/17,
https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/444207-nuclear-energy-cooperation-with-a-twist

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [has come under
scrutiny]{.underline} from Congress and the nonproliferation policy
community [about]{.underline} its approval of [commercial nuclear
[dealings with Saudi Arabia]{.mark}]{.underline}, prior to the
completion of a nuclear cooperation agreement between the two countries.
While it is important for the administration to adhere to
long-established U.S. nonproliferation practices, [these activities
**[are not]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the most consequential shift in U.S.
nuclear]{.mark} energy coop]{.underline}eration [[policy]{.mark}making
in the Trump administration]{.underline}.

Since taking office, President [[Trump]{.mark} has **[adopted a
confrontational stance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.mark}ward
[commercial]{.mark} nuclear [development by Russian and Chinese
companies]{.mark}]{.underline} who are [building commercial nuclear
power]{.underline} reactors domestically and exporting them abroad.
[[The]{.mark} administration's [approach]{.mark}]{.underline} --- in
which it has labeled the countries "predatory revisionists" ---
[**[threatens]{.mark} nuclear [nonprolif]{.mark}eration far more** than
the administration's support of]{.underline} U.S. nuclear cooperation
with [Saudi Arabia, **or any country, for that matter.**]{.underline}

In criticizing the practices of Russian and Chinese nuclear energy
suppliers, administration officials have emphasized --- among a range of
criticisms --- how neither China nor Russia subscribes to all of the
stringent nonproliferation standards of supply that the United States
does. [To ensure that commercial nuclear trade doesn't lead to nuclear
weapons development, U.S. [officials argue, the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[needs to be more aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark} in [pursuing
international nuclear energy]{.underline} trade, [which would enable it
[to set]{.mark} global nonproliferation [standards]{.mark}
through]{.underline} its [cooperative arrangements]{.underline} with
partner countries.

[[This]{.mark} position, however]{.underline},
**[[undercuts]{.underline}]{.mark}** [rather than supports
[nonprolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} policymaking
**[[globally]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Both [[China and Russia
are]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [[the most]{.mark} [active
suppliers]{.mark}]{.underline} within the global nuclear energy
marketplace, [[and]{.underline} **[are likely to
be]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[for the foreseeable future]{.underline}**,
[regardless of]{.underline} the level of [U.S.]{.underline} nuclear
energy [exports, as demand]{.underline} for nuclear energy [grows in
Asia and the Middle East]{.underline}. [**[Both]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [members of the]{.mark}]{.underline}
Nuclear Suppliers Group ([[NSG]{.underline}]{.mark}), the nuclear supply
cartel that the United States helped found in the 1970s. [As such, [they
limit]{.mark} the [supply]{.mark} of nuclear technologies and materials
[to countries **that have specific**]{.mark} **nuclear
[nonprolif]{.mark}eration [standards]{.mark}** in place]{.underline},
just as all NSG members (including the United States) are required to
do.

[[In criticizing China and Russia, U.S. officials]{.underline}]{.mark}
have [[argued]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[neither]{.underline}]{.mark}
country [[requires]{.mark} recipients]{.underline} of nuclear assistance
[to have]{.underline} in place [the most stringent type of
safeguards]{.underline} --- [those]{.underline} spelled out [in
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[I]{.underline}**nternational
**[A]{.underline}**tomic **[E]{.underline}**nergy
**[A]{.underline}**gency's [[Additional Protocol]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- against the diversion of nuclear materials and technologies to use
in nuclear weapons development. [[U.S. officials]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[argue]{.underline}]{.mark} that these [[suppliers should
limit]{.mark} the ability of their nuclear partners to develop
sensitive]{.underline} nuclear [technologies, such as]{.underline}
uranium [[enrichment and]{.underline}]{.mark} spent fuel
[[reprocessing]{.underline}]{.mark} technologies.

[By [attempting to unilaterally]{.mark} raise the baseline
nonproliferation [requirements]{.mark} for all commercial nuclear trade,
**U.S. officials are [undercut]{.mark}ting the [salience of]{.mark}
those requirements that the [NSG and other]{.mark} nonproliferation
[efforts]{.mark} do enforce**]{.underline}. [Universal
adherence]{.underline} [to the Additional Protocol would be]{.underline}
a [welcome]{.underline} development, [as would the concentration of
all]{.underline} sensitive [nuclear tech]{.underline}nologies in a few
controlled locations. **[But]{.underline}** [[it is]{.underline}
**[counterproductive]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[to criticize
supplier states]{.mark} for embracing most, but not all, of the
nonproliferation standards it supports]{.underline}.

[[In confronting]{.underline} **[stringent
U.S]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[. nonproliferation
[requirements]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [recipient states
**could**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[begin to
[question]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the value of adopting [other]{.mark}
nonproliferation [standards]{.mark} besides the Additional
Protocol]{.underline}. And [[some supply countries could
require]{.underline}]{.mark} **[even [less-restrictive]{.mark}
nonproliferation [standards]{.mark}]{.underline}** [solely [to
maintain]{.mark} their [competitiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Making
it more difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} [for states [to acquire]{.mark}
U.S]{.underline}.-origin nuclear [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[increase]{.mark} the [political
resentment of states]{.mark}]{.underline}** [designated as]{.underline}
**[n]{.underline}**on-**[n]{.underline}**uclear
**[w]{.underline}**eapons **[s]{.underline}**tates by the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), [[who]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[already
question]{.mark} the commitment of [nuclear supplier states]{.mark} to
ensuring access to peaceful nuclear technologies]{.underline}**. [[This
**threatens**]{.mark} **to further erode the standing of [the
NPT]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [as it goes into]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
2020]{.underline} **[[Rev]{.underline}]{.mark}**iew
**[[Con]{.underline}]{.mark}**ference.

[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [[were]{.underline}]{.mark} genuinely [[interested
in]{.mark} using civilian nuclear cooperation to enhance global
[nonprolif]{.mark}eration, [it would]{.mark}]{.underline} try to find
ways to [work with other nuclear supplier countries]{.underline} ---
including Russia and China --- [to [ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[adequate supply]{.underline}]{.mark} of nuclear technologies and
materials [[in a manner that]{.mark} [promulgates all]{.mark} nuclear
nonproliferation standards]{.underline}, **[[not just
those]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that are most [important to
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

[This rationale lay behind the U.S. push for China to join the NSG in
the first place. China's supply of nuclear tech]{.underline}nologies to
Pakistan aside, its membership in the NSG [makes it **more
likely**]{.underline} [that its nuclear exports **will meet existing NSG
requirements**]{.underline} [than if it were outside of the group.
**[Instead of criticizing China]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for not doing
something that it never agreed not to do, the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[should work within the NSG]{.mark} to make adoption of the Additional
Protocol mandatory]{.underline} for the supply of nuclear technologies
and materials by NSG suppliers.

Similarly, [if the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [is concerned about]{.underline} those
countries that receive [Russian nuclear assistance]{.underline}
obtaining sensitive nuclear technologies, then [[it should work
with]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}n officials and scientists to
develop international means of providing assured supplies of nuclear
fuel and of disposing of spent nuclear fuel. The development of such
capacities would go a long way toward limiting the means of making the
sensitive nuclear materials that are necessary for creating a nuclear
weapon.

[[International]{.mark} nuclear [energy coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}
**[[can]{.mark} help to [limit nuclear]{.mark} weapons
[prolif]{.mark}eration [if]{.mark} delivered [with]{.mark} sufficient
[incentives]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- [such as]{.underline} the promise
of valuable [tech]{.underline}nology, [materials and
expertise]{.underline}. [**[But]{.underline}** [trying to twist the arm
of suppliers]{.underline}]{.mark} [without offering much]{.underline} of
value in return **[[is not likely to get the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates any closer [to]{.mark} its [nonprolif]{.mark}eration
objectives]{.underline}**.

### UQ\-\--Arms Sales High

#### Arms sales [growing]{.underline} -- no topic thumpers [even if]{.underline} the specific sales are shifting

And I think it's very timely. Obviously, [change is afoot in the world
of U.S. arms transfers. [You're seeing]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[dramatic
growth]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} the level --
[[the]{.mark} dollar va[lue of U.S. arms exports]{.mark}]{.underline},
and also changes in the world market. So the focus of [where exports are
going is shifting as demand around the world changes.]{.underline}

[[We're]{.mark} also [seeing]{.mark}]{.underline} that our [[arms
exports]{.underline}]{.mark} and security cooperation [more generally
[are a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[major focus]{.mark} of the
strategy]{.underline}**, [both [in the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[N]{.underline}**]{.mark}ational **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ecurity

**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**trategy. And [no doubt related to that
[there's a **huge leadership focus on it.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It's
something]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we see the

[It's]{.mark} something that has [been a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[focus]{.underline}** [for the **sec**]{.underline}]{.mark}retary of
**[[def]{.underline}]{.mark}**ense. And so [[it has a leadership
focus]{.mark} that is]{.underline} **[pretty
[unparalleled]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the last year and a

#### State is [expanding arms sales]{.underline}

As just one example of this effort, not even a month ago really I
attended the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K., where I met with defense
industry representatives from U.S. companies of all sizes to discuss the
CAT Policy implementation plan and to seek feedback in real time. And
let me say, again, those companies were both small and medium, as well
as large. So we tried to hit on the array of companies that were
represented there, all of which were present. [[I]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[met with]{.underline}]{.mark} counterparts from strategic
[partners and [allies]{.mark}]{.underline} -- some from Europe, other
parts of the world -- to brief them on the president's new policy, and
[[to advocate **strongly** for]{.underline} **[ongoing and prospective
defense sales.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

**[[For years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, U.S. [[embassies and consulates
have been **committed**]{.underline} [to supporting]{.underline}]{.mark}
U.S. companies' [[efforts to **grow**]{.mark} **their [global
exports]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Our [[diplomats]{.mark} have **[long
worked]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[U.S. [products]{.mark} and services]{.underline} have the best possible
chance to [[compete]{.mark} abroad]{.underline}. Through participation
in key forms like Farnborough, [[the administration's]{.underline}
**[defense]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[-trade-[focused
initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[build]{.mark} up[on]{.mark}
[this]{.mark} tradition]{.underline} of economic diplomacy [[and direct
the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [[government to support]{.mark} America's
defense industry **by strengthening our [advocacy for defense
sales]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are obviously so critical to our
national interest.

#### Trump's [mission]{.underline} is arms sales -- policy has been created to [streamline]{.underline} the process

Transcript of a CSIS event, 8/8,

Ambassador Kaidanow outlined how our new CAT Policy and the national
implementation plan for that policy both reflect the president's
National Security Strategies and the National Defense Strategy. She also
discussed how [[the CAT Policy is]{.mark} designed
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[expand opportunities]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline}]{.mark} [American [industry]{.mark}]{.underline},
create American jobs, and maintain U.S. national security.

So what I want to do in these couple minutes is to delve a little bit
deeper into the implementation plan and what that plan contains and try
to explain those a little bit more in depth, those three lines of effort
that she mentioned. And to remind you, those three lines of effort are:
prioritizing strategic competition, organizing for success, and creating
conducive environments.

So the implementation plan that we were tasked with putting together in
the CAT Policy is an effort by us to really carry out the president's
vision. [It is an effort to better align our conventional arms transfers
with our national security and]{.underline} our national [economic
interests.]{.underline}

So, [under this first line]{.underline} of effort [-- the prioritizing
strategic competition -- [we're taking]{.mark}]{.underline} -- we're
trying to take [[a **more proactive approach to arms
transfers**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Specifically, [[we're]{.mark} trying
to improve our ability to compete]{.underline} with our adversaries [by
[providing]{.mark}]{.underline} our [partners]{.underline} with [viable
[alternatives to foreign products]{.mark}]{.underline} in order [to
maintain influence in key regions]{.underline} throughout the world.
[[We're]{.mark} going to]{.underline} be [[working
with]{.underline}]{.mark} our partners and [[allies to]{.mark} identify
critical capability requirements]{.underline} that they have
[and]{.underline} then trying to **[[expedite
transfers]{.underline}]{.mark}** to support these essential foreign
policy and national security objectives.

The second line of effort -- the [[organizing for
success]{.underline}]{.mark} line of effort -- [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
actually really taking a close look at how we are organized within the
executive branch and how we are doing our day-to-day work, and what we
need to do -- to focus on to make sure that we are best positioned to
facilitate transfers that meet our national security objectives. For
example, we're going to continue [to update]{.underline} the [policies
and regulations]{.underline} that provide us the framework for our arms
transfer decisions. Specifically, [we'll look at]{.underline}
**[[streamlining]{.underline}]{.mark}** the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations, or [[ITAR]{.mark}, and]{.underline} also [continuing
to revise [the]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. [[Munitions List and the
Commerce Control List]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[We will]{.underline}]{.mark} also [be looking at the
day-to-day]{.underline} processes [to [ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[we are]{.mark} as **[efficient]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
[**[streamlined]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} as
[**[effective]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as possible]{.underline}. So some
of the things that [[we're]{.mark} looking]{.underline} at, and that
folks in industry and associations have asked us to look at, is:
establishing milestones and timelines for the foreign military sales
process; improving and **[[speeding up]{.underline}]{.mark}** our
[[contracting]{.underline}]{.mark} process -- processes within the
Defense Department; [[trying to **increase**]{.mark} **the
[competitiveness]{.mark} of U.S. defense items and
systems**]{.underline} [by building in exportability]{.underline} to the
design and development; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} also by [[expanding
support]{.mark} for]{.underline} what we call [non-program-of-record
systems. [We're looking into]{.mark}]{.underline} potential
[[financing]{.underline}]{.mark} options [[that could make our
systems]{.underline} **[more attainable]{.underline}**]{.mark} for our
foreign partners. And [we're]{.underline} also [examining]{.underline}
existing [polices to ensure]{.underline} that [they don't]{.underline}
unnecessarily [detract from our ability to compete in]{.underline}
international -- in [the international marketplace]{.underline}.
Finally, one of the other things that [[we're looking]{.mark} very
closely]{.underline} at is our advocacy process [[to make
sure]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we are the **most effective advocates
for**]{.mark} **U.S. [industry.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The third line of effort -- [[creating]{.mark} conducive [environments
-- is aimed at]{.mark}]{.underline} addressing things that are -- that
are outside the executive branch, outside of our purview and control.
And so what that means, for example, is working with the State
Department's committees of jurisdiction to address any [[legislative
fixes that]{.mark} could **[increase efficiencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in the system; also, working with the other -- the other committees,
too, with the DOD committees, to see if there are any fixes that might
help as well; [working with our partners]{.underline} -- our
international partners to try to help better define their requirements
and their needs [to]{.underline} that that can help **[speed up the
processes]{.underline}**; [[addressing]{.underline}]{.mark} overly
[**[burdensome]{.underline}** [policies]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
create barriers for U.S. entry]{.underline}, such as overly restrictive
offset polices of our foreign partners; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} also,
[[working]{.mark} with industry]{.underline} to try **[[to increase
production capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}** in order [to decrease the
lead times for U.S. defense items.]{.underline}

**[[In sum,]{.underline}]{.mark}** what [[we're trying
to]{.underline}]{.mark} do in this -- in this whole-of-government effort
looking at the arms transfer process really from soup to nuts is trying
to ensure that once we have decided that a transfer of a defense
capability to a partner is in the national security interest of the
United States, that we are able to **[[effectively
compete]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} **[efficiently
deliver]{.underline}** the [equipment]{.underline} to our partner as
quickly as possible.

### UQ\-\--Arms Sales High\-\--A2: Barriers to Sale

#### CAT [reverses]{.underline} former barriers and [strengthens]{.underline} the defense base

**Gray 18** \-\-\-- Alex, Special Assistant for the Office of Trade and
Manufacturing Policy in the White House, "U.S. Arms Transfer Policy:
Shaping the Way Ahead," Transcript of a CSIS event, 8/8,

CAT was designed in response to a shifting strategic landscape that's
increasingly characterized by great-power competition across the
political, economic, and military spheres. [[CAT prioritizes]{.mark}
staying ahead of]{.underline} this [competition by
[responding]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[proactively]{.underline}**]{.mark}
instead of reactively [[to]{.mark} the [defense needs]{.mark} of
allies]{.underline} and partners. It also recognizes one of this
president's signature themes: economic security is national security.
**[[By removing]{.mark} some of the [previous]{.mark} administration's
artificial [barriers to the transfer]{.mark} [of
arms]{.mark}]{.underline}** to critical partners, [the UAS export policy
being one example, [this administration is]{.mark}]{.underline} both
[[strengthening our hand]{.mark} in]{.underline} the ongoing [strategic
competition while]{.underline} also [stimulating economic
growth]{.underline} at home, as well as job creation.

It should be noted that the U.S. aerospace and defense industries
contribute almost \$1 trillion annually to the U.S. economy and they
support about 2 ½ million American jobs. Just as one point, the
international -- UAS export market alone is estimated to be worth more
than \$50 billion a year within the next decade. Those are the stakes
we're competing for.

[[Key objectives]{.mark} of CAT going forward]{.underline} -- and Laura
outlined most of these -- [[working]{.underline}]{.mark} closely [[with
allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and partners to identify the capability
requirements they have [and undertaking a whole-of-government
response]{.underline} to meet those needs. Particularly, one of the
things that [our office has been very much involved in]{.underline} with
NSC and State is the **[[advocacy]{.underline}]{.mark}** piece of this,
[and [ensuring]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the [competitiveness
of]{.mark} our [defense exports]{.mark} abroad]{.underline} for both
economic and security purposes is maintained. I would note, as
Ambassador Kaidanow did, that the administration dispatched one of the
highest-level delegations to date to the Farnborough Airshow several
months ago, which I think demonstrates just how committed the
whole-of-government approach is to that particular aspect.

[[Working]{.mark} with partners [to ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that
U.S. [[barriers to entry are **reduced**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and that
policies like offset requirements do not threaten]{.underline} American
[jobs]{.underline} or reduce our technological edge.

[[And]{.underline}]{.mark}, like Laura said, [[continuing to
update]{.mark} the policy and regulatory [frameworks that
underlie]{.mark} the [arms]{.mark} transfer [policy,
including]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[revising]{.mark} outdated [policies
and updating]{.mark} regulatory [frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[like ITAR]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [CAT]{.mark}]{.underline} Policy [[is part of]{.underline} **[a
larger]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[administration
[effort]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to stress]{.mark} the connectivity of
[economic and national security]{.mark}]{.underline}, another being the
assessment of the defense and manufacturing industrial base that was
mandated by Executive Order 13806, which we're hoping will be released
in the near future. Defense exports are an important tool for
maintaining a healthy and resilient defense industrial base, including
one capable of surging in a crisis. A diversified defense export sector
also supports a wide variety of critical labor skills that are required
by the U.S. defense industrial base, as well as our allies and partners.

### UQ\-\--Arms Sales High\-\--A2: State Review

#### State's new CAT Policy is focused on [sustaining arms sales]{.underline}

**Kaidanow 18** \-\-\-- Tina, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for
Political-Military Affairs, master\'s degree in political science
(Columbia University), "U.S. Arms Transfer Policy: Shaping the Way
Ahead," Transcript of a CSIS event, 8/8,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead

So, with no further ado, let me just say I think, again, as Andrew
mentioned and I know that most of you are aware, in April of this past
year the president issued a national security policy memorandum
announcing a revised conventional arms transfer -- or, as we like to
call it affectionately, a CAT -- policy. [The [CAT Policy]{.mark}
provides a framework under which the U.S.]{.underline} government and
all of its agencies [will review and evaluate proposed arms transfers.
The new policy [reflects]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[priorities]{.underline}]{.mark} of the president's National Security
Strategy, which are, namely, [to preserve peace through strength by
reforming regulations]{.underline} **[[to facilitate the exports of U.S.
military equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [to strengthen partners and
allies; to facilitate U.S. economic security and innovation]{.underline}
-- we'll talk a little bit more about that; and to uphold respect for
human rights and U.S. nonproliferation objectives. In short, [[the
new]{.mark} CAT [Policy was]{.mark} designed [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[expand opportunities for]{.mark} American
[industry]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [create American jobs, and maintain
U.S. national security]{.underline}, ensuring that we continue to review
each arms transfer thoroughly in order to ensure that it is in the
national interest of the United States.

The release of [[the new policy was only the first step]{.mark} in a
series of]{.underline} what we believe will be very practical
results-focused [initiatives [to]{.mark}]{.underline} transform the way
that the U.S. government works to **[support and [grow our
defense]{.mark} industrial [base.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Through that
memorandum, the president also directed the secretary of state, in
coordination with the secretaries of defense, commerce, and energy, to
submit an implementation plan within 60 days. So, during the 60 days
following the release of the policy, my colleagues from across the
executive branch and I met with stakeholders from industry, from civil
society, as well as congressional staffers to collect all of their input
and hopefully closely align our implementation plan with real-world
challenges. In fact, as part of this engagement, in April I met with a
group of scholars from the NGO and think-tank community right here at
CSIS to discuss the new CAT Policy. We're very grateful for everybody
who contributed feedback to that very important process.

And subsequently, as directed by the president's national security
policy memorandum, we did indeed submit a national implementation plan
on July 13 th. The plan represents an integrated strategy, one that
aligns our conventional arms transfers with our national security and
economic interests, and it's built on three specific lines of effort.

First, [[the plan calls]{.mark} for]{.underline} prioritizing strategic
and economic competition through [a paradigm shift from the current
reactive posture [to]{.mark} a more proactive posture that]{.underline}
**[[actively develops partnerships]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and
capabilities reflective of]{.underline} U.S. strategic and economic
[objectives. [We will]{.mark} use this policy tool to
[ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[U.S. products]{.mark} can
[win]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the competitive global
marketplace]{.underline}.

Second, the plan envisions organizing our efforts for success, ensuring
that the executive branch is positioned, staffed, and resourced to best
support efficient execution of the Conventional Arms Transfer Policy,
and that its processes are also similarly constructed.

Third, [the plan calls]{.underline} for creating conducive environments
through engagement with Congress, industry, international partners, and
other stakeholders [to foster the efficient operation of U.S. defense
trade]{.underline}.

[What all this]{.underline} really ultimately [means]{.underline} and
what the initiative makes clear [is that under this administration
**[there will be no more active advocate for]{.mark} U.S. [sales than
the]{.mark} U.S. [government]{.mark} itself**]{.underline}. Thus,
[[a]{.underline} **[top priority]{.underline}**]{.mark} of my bureau --
the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs at the State Department -- [[is
maintaining the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[as the security partner of
choice]{.mark} for]{.underline} our many [friends and
allies]{.underline} overseas.

### UQ\-\--Nonprolif Cred Low

[[There has]{.underline} **[long]{.underline}** [been a **nagging
sense**]{.underline}]{.mark} [around the world that [U.S]{.mark}.
emphasis on [nonprolif]{.mark}eration [is
**insincere**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, the [U.S. officials who
advocated invading Iraq]{.underline} to stop a nuclear weapons program
that did not exist [and]{.underline} now [complain]{.underline} wildly
[about Iran]{.underline}'s nuclear weapons program [are happy to ignore
Israel's]{.underline} nuclear [arsenal. Those same
officials]{.underline} also [argued for carving out an exception for
India despite its refusal to sign the NPT]{.underline}. And many critics
point out that Libyan dictator Muammar al-[Qaddafi abandoned his
nuclear]{.underline} weapons [program]{.underline} in exchange
[for]{.underline} what he believed to be British and [U.S. security
guarantees, only to be toppled]{.underline} with the support of British
and U.S. airpower.

[[It's possible to rationalize]{.mark} each of these
[cases]{.mark}]{.underline}. India and Israel were already de facto
nuclear powers at the time of the NPT and refused to sign it. That's
rather different than North Korea and Iran today. And Qaddafi could
probably never have finished building the bomb, so why promise him
immunity for murdering protestors, many ask. These [[inconsistencies
have not]{.underline}]{.mark} in any case [[altered the general
sense]{.underline}]{.mark} that [responsible countries]{.underline},
such as Japan and South Korea, [should not acquire nuclear
weapons]{.underline}---and that if they made any attempt to do so, the
result would be international isolation.

[[At least, that]{.underline}]{.mark} understanding [[held]{.underline}
**[until Trump]{.underline}**]{.mark} came along. On the campaign trail,
[Trump frequently made comments suggesting]{.underline} that it would
not be such a bad thing if [Japan or South Korea built an atomic
bomb]{.underline}. This was mostly bluster. Trump tended to raise the
possibility as a defensive reaction whenever he was criticized for
suggesting that allies pay more for their own defense. But
[[it's]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[clear]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[Trump doesn't believe in]{.mark} rules or [norms]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The problem with his approach to proliferation in Iran and North Korea
is that it is not, fundamentally, about proliferation]{.underline} at
all.

[[Arms sales create]{.mark} a host of]{.underline} negative,
[[unintended consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} that warrant a much more
cautious and limited approach, even in support of an expansive grand
strategy like primacy or liberal hegemony. From the perspective of those
who would prefer a more restrained American foreign policy, the
prospective benefits of engaging in the arms trade are even smaller.
Even in cases where the United States wants a nation to arm itself,
there is rarely a need for the weapons to come from the United States.
Moreover, [[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[would generate]{.underline}
[**significant diplomatic flexibility and moral authority** by
refraining from selling arms.]{.underline}]{.mark} Given these outsized
risks and nebulous rewards, the United States should greatly reduce
international arms sales.

To develop our argument [we begin]{.underline} in section one [with a
quantitative analysis of U.S. arms sales since 9/11]{.underline} in
order [to illustrate the]{.underline} dangerous [track
record]{.underline} of recent sales. [[We]{.underline}]{.mark} then
[[provide a]{.mark} brief [history of U.S.]{.mark} arms [sales]{.mark}
policy [to provide]{.mark} a [context for the current
process]{.mark}]{.underline} in section two. Section three outlines the
advocates' case for arms sales and section four outlines the case
against. We conclude with a brief discussion of the current politics of
the arms trade and a series of policy recommendations.

4\. [[The Saudi arms deal will privilege military solutions]{.underline}
**[at the expense of diplomacy.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

When countries believe they have the ability to impose their will by
military force, their desire to negotiate dwindles. [By selling the
Saudis weapons, [the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[will embolden]{.mark} [Saudi
ha]{.mark}wks to continue pressing for a military approach]{.underline},
[[**not only** in the short run]{.mark} in Yemen, **[but in
other]{.mark} conflict [areas as well]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[Likewise, when Israel or Iran]{.mark}'s national security team
[meet]{.mark}s, [the]{.mark} U.S. weapons [sale]{.mark} to the Saudis
[will **give those hawks the upper hand**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in their
discussions]{.underline}. [[This problem will be **further
multiplied**]{.underline} [by every other instance]{.underline}]{.mark}
[where the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [is selling weapons]{.underline} in the Middle
East. [[The dynamic will]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, encourage arms
racing, inflame tensions, will very likely amplify existing violence,
and in short will [[make it much more difficult for leaders]{.mark} of
all nations in the region [to work to]{.mark}ward [diplomatic
solutions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Beyond their impact on the recipients']{.underline} interest in
[diplomacy, [U.S. reliance on]{.mark} arms [sales]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [**[destroys America's moral authority]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[reduces its diplomatic
flexibility]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [By arming oppressive
governments]{.underline} throughout the Middle East without regard for
the consequences, not only does [[the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates risk
the resentment of Arab populations and the wrath of terrorist groups, it
also **[[loses the ability]{.mark}]{.underline}** to call out autocratic
behavior, [[to inspire]{.mark} political [change]{.mark}]{.underline},
and to speak credibly to democratic movements. By using weapons sales to
take sides in various sectarian and regional disputes,
[[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[loses the ability]{.underline}**
[to serve as]{.underline}]{.mark} [a convener of stakeholders and [a
mediator of peace agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}. This, in turn, leaves
the United States even more reliant on military tools.

Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy even in cases
where the United States has an entrenched interest. [In the case of
Taiwan]{.underline}, for example, though it is clear that Taiwan needs
to purchase weapons from other countries to provide for its defense,
those weapons do not have to be made in the United States. [[Having
Taiwan buy from other suppliers **would**]{.mark} **help [defuse
U.S.-China tensions.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Even if Taiwan's defenses
remained robust, China would]{.mark} **clearly
[prefer]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[a situation in which American arms no
longer signal an implicit promise to fight]{.mark} on Taiwan's behalf.
[This could]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[promote more productive
U.S.-China diplomacy **in general**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as
greater stability in the Pacific region. Most important, breaking off
arms sales would also reduce the likelihood of the United States
becoming entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan and China.

### A2: Turn\-\--Leverage

#### Arms sales don't create leverage with the [right audiences]{.underline} -- allies already support US wishes, adversaries (including major forces like China and Russia) will never support US policy, we don't sell weapons to other adversaries we'd need to convince, many states don't think the carrot is enough to support the US policy request, US is barred from selling to some crucial actors, and other countries can't afford arms or enough of them for sales to provide leverage

[Arms for]{.underline} (**[Not That Much]{.underline}**)
[Influence]{.underline}. Successful foreign policy involves encouraging
other nations to behave in ways that benefit the United States. As
noted, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [has often attempted to use arms sales to
generate]{.underline} the sort of [leverage or influence]{.underline}
necessary to do this. [[History reveals]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[however]{.underline}**, that [the [benefits of]{.mark} the [arms for
influence]{.mark} strategy]{.underline} **[[are
limited]{.underline}]{.mark}** for two main reasons.

First, [the range of cases in which arms sales can produce useful
leverage is **much narrower than is often imagined**]{.underline}. Most
obviously, [arms [sales are **unnecessary**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
situations [[where the other country]{.mark} already
[agrees]{.mark}]{.underline} or complies [[with the American
position]{.underline}]{.mark} or can be encouraged to do so without such
incentives. [This]{.underline} category [includes]{.underline}
**[most]{.underline}** [U.S. allies and close partners
under]{.underline} **[many]{.underline}**, though not all,
[circumstances]{.underline}.

**[Just as clearly]{.underline}**, the [[arms for
influence]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy [[is a]{.underline}
**[nonstarter]{.underline}** [when the other state will
never]{.underline}]{.mark} [agree to [comply]{.mark} with American
demands. [This]{.mark}]{.underline} category
[[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} a small group of **[obvious
cases]{.underline}** [such as [Russia, China, Iran,

wishes [[would be politically]{.mark} too [dangerous]{.mark} for that
state's leadership]{.underline}.59

**[In addition]{.underline}**, [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} some
[[cases]{.mark} in which [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
itself [[would view]{.mark} arms sales [as]{.mark}]{.underline} an
**[[inappropriate]{.underline}]{.mark}** tool. [The [Leahy]{.mark}
Law,]{.underline} for example, [[bars]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [from providing
security [assistance to any]{.mark}]{.underline} specific [foreign
[military]{.mark}]{.underline} unit deemed [[responsible
for]{.underline}]{.mark} past human [rights
[abuses]{.mark}]{.underline}.60 **[More broadly]{.underline}**, [arms
[sales are]{.mark}]{.underline} clearly a [[risky]{.underline}]{.mark}
choice [[when the recipient]{.underline}]{.mark} state [[is]{.mark} a
[failed]{.mark} state [or]{.mark}]{.underline} when it is [engaged
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} a civil conflict or interstate
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, [[in such cases **it is**]{.mark}
**often [unclear whether there is anyone to negotiate]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} in the first place**, and governments are **at best on
shaky ground**]{.underline}. At present [the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[bars]{.underline} **[17 such nations]{.underline}** [from
purchasing]{.underline}]{.mark} [American [arms. As long as these
nations are embargoed]{.mark}, **arms [sales will remain]{.mark} an
[irrelevant]{.mark} option [for]{.mark} exerting
[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.61

[Apart from these cases, [there is a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[large
group]{.mark} of nations]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}
**[tiny]{.underline}** [defense budgets [that]{.mark} **simply [don't
buy enough]{.mark} major conventional weaponry** to provide much
incentive]{.underline} for arms sales. [On this list are as many
as]{.underline} **[[112 countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that
[purchased less than \$100 million]{.mark}]{.underline} in
[arms]{.underline} from the United States between 2002 and 2016,
[including Venezuela, Jamaica, and Sudan. **Lest this category be
dismissed** because it includes mostly smaller and less strategically
significant countries]{.underline} from the American perspective, [it
should be noted that **[each]{.mark} of these countries [has a vote in
the U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations**]{.underline} [(and
other]{.underline} international [organizations) and that]{.underline}
**[many]{.underline}** of them [suffer from civil conflicts and
terrorism, making them **potential targets of interest**]{.underline}
[for American policymakers looking for international
influence.]{.underline}

**[By definition]{.underline}**, [then]{.underline}, the
[arms-for-influence]{.underline} strategy [is]{.underline}
**[limited]{.underline}** to cases in which a currently noncompliant
country might be willing to change its policies (at least for the right
price or to avoid punishment).

[The second problem with]{.underline} the [arms for
influence]{.underline} strategy [is that [international pressure]{.mark}
in general]{.underline}, whether in the form of economic sanctions, arms
sales and embargoes, or military and foreign aid promises and threats,
typically [[has a **very limited impact**]{.underline}
[on]{.underline}]{.mark} [state [behavior. Though]{.mark}]{.underline}
again, on paper, [the [logic]{.mark}]{.underline} of both coercion and
buying compliance [[looks straightforward, **research
shows**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [leaders make decisions
on]{.underline} the basis of [factors **other** than just the national
balance sheet]{.underline}. In particular,
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to [[respond]{.underline} [**far
more** to]{.underline}]{.mark} [concerns about
[national]{.mark}]{.underline} security [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} their
own [[regime security than]{.underline}]{.mark} they do to [external
[pressure]{.mark}. [Arms sales]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether [used **as
carrots or sticks**, [are]{.mark}]{.underline} in effect **[[a]{.mark}
fairly [weak version of]{.mark} economic
[sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [which research has shown
have]{.underline} **[limited effects]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [even when
approved by the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations, and tend to spawn a host of unintended
consequences. As such, the [[expectations]{.mark} for their
utility]{.underline} [[should]{.mark} [be]{.mark} **even more
[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}.62 [A recent study
regarding]{.underline} the impact of economic [sanctions came to a
similar conclusion, noting that, "The economic impact]{.underline} of
sanctions [may be pronounced ... but]{.underline} **[[other
factors]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the situational context]{.underline}
**[almost [always overshadow]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[the impact of
sanctions in determining the political outcome]{.underline}]{.mark}."63
The authors of [another study evaluating]{.underline} the impact of
[military aid]{.underline} **[concur]{.underline}**,
[arguing]{.underline} that, "In general [we find]{.underline} that
[[military aid]{.underline} **[does not lead to more
coop]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[erative behavior]{.underline}** [on the
part of the recipient state.]{.underline} With limited exceptions,
[[increasing levels]{.underline}]{.mark} of U.S. [aid [are linked to a
**significant reduction in coop**]{.mark}**erative foreign policy
behavior."**]{.underline}64

[[has]{.mark} had [exerting]{.mark}]{.underline} this kind of [[leverage
came during]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Reagan]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration. Sen. Robert [[Kasten]{.underline}]{.mark} Jr. (R-WI)
[[signaled]{.mark} the **[concern]{.mark} of many**]{.underline} [[when
he said, "Many]{.underline}]{.mark} countries [[to whom we dispense
aid]{.underline}]{.mark} **[continue to [thumb their noses]{.mark} [at
us"]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[at the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations,
and Congress passed legislation authorizing the president to limit aid
to any state that repeatedly voted in opposition to the United States at
the UN.65 In 1986, the [[Reagan]{.underline}]{.mark} administration
[began to monitor voting patterns and issue threats, and,
in]{.underline} roughly [20 cases]{.underline} in 1987 and 1988, [it
[lowered]{.mark}]{.underline} the amount of [[aid]{.mark} sent [to
nations]{.mark} the administration felt were [not deferential
enough]{.mark}]{.underline}. An [analysis of the
[results,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[however]{.underline}**,
[found]{.underline} **[no linkage]{.underline}** [between changes
in]{.underline}]{.mark} [American [support and UN voting]{.mark}
patterns by recipient states. [The]{.mark}]{.underline} authors'
[[conclusion **fits neatly**]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark}[in
the [broader literature]{.mark} about the]{.underline} **[limited impact
of sanctions:]{.underline}** "[The [resilience of]{.mark} aid
[recipients]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[clearly

[[The U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} track [[record]{.mark} of generating
influence through arms sales]{.underline} specifically [[is **quite
mixed**]{.underline}]{.mark}. U.S. arms sales may have improved Israeli
security over the years, for example, but [American [attempts to
pressure Israel]{.mark} into negotiating]{.underline} a durable
[peace]{.underline} settlement with the Palestinians [have [had **little
impact**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[Nor]{.underline}**
[have]{.underline}]{.mark} [arms [sales provided]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates with
[enough [leverage]{.mark}]{.underline} over the years [[to
prevent]{.mark} client states such as]{.underline} [**[Iraq, Iran,
Turkey, Indonesia, and Morocco]{.underline}** [from
invading]{.underline}]{.mark} [their [neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
**[Nor]{.underline}**]{.mark} [have arms sales helped
[restrain]{.mark}]{.underline} the human [[rights
abuses]{.underline}]{.mark} of clients like Chile or Libya, or various
Middle Eastern client states. [Although the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has used the promise
of arms sales]{.underline} [or the threat of denying arms successfully
from time to time, the **[failures outnumber]{.mark} the
[victories]{.mark}**. The **most rigorous study** conducted]{.underline}
to tease out the conditions under which arms for influence efforts are
successful [is]{.underline} a 1994 study [by]{.underline} John
[Sislin]{.underline}.67 [[Collating]{.mark} 191
[attempts]{.mark}]{.underline} between 1950 and 1992, [[Sislin
codes]{.underline}]{.mark} 80 of those attempts [[(42 percent)
successful]{.underline}]{.mark}. Sislin's analysis is incomplete,
however, since he looks only at the immediate benefits of arms sales and
does not consider the long-term consequences.

**[Furthermore]{.underline}**, [a close look at the supposedly
successful attempts reveals]{.underline} that
**[[many]{.underline}]{.mark}** of them [[are]{.mark} cases in which
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [is]{.underline} in fact
[**[simply]{.underline}** [buying something **rather
than**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[actually ["influencing"]{.mark} another
nation]{.underline}**. [Thirty]{.underline} of the [cases]{.underline}
Sislin coded as successful [were instances of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [using arms to buy
access to military bases]{.underline} (20 cases) [or]{.underline} to
[raw materials]{.underline} (5 cases) [or]{.underline} to
[encourage]{.underline} [countries to buy more American
weapons]{.underline} (5 cases).68 [[Without those]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the dataset, [[the]{.mark} U.S. success [rate **drops to 31

Finally, the [[conditions for]{.mark} successful

**deteriorating**]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, [Sislin's study
found]{.underline} that [American influence was at its height during the

world]{.underline}. [[With the **leveling out**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [global]{.underline} distribution of

**[[American Hypocrisy Is Harming Nonprolif]{.mark}eration
[Efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}**

At the United Nations this week, U.S. President Donald
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} smilingly [[teased a]{.mark}nother
[summit]{.mark}]{.underline} to discuss nuclear weapons
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} North Korean leader
[[Kim]{.underline}]{.mark} Jong Un [[and]{.mark} then angrily
[denounced]{.mark} reports]{.underline} that [he]{.underline} had
[sought [a similar meeting with]{.mark}]{.underline} Iranian President
Hassan [[Rouhani. The]{.underline} **[disparity]{.underline}**
[reflected Trump's **personalist approach**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[to
nuclear weapons]{.underline}**: [he rejects any policy associated with
his predecessor while embracing those leaders who flatter his
sense]{.underline} of himself [as a supreme dealmaker]{.underline}. On
substance alone, it's impossible to understand the decision to reject
the Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,
as "the worst deal ever" while embracing a denuclearization process with
North Korea that imposes no requirements at all. But if Trump is
prioritizing his feelings over his policy preferences, the two actions
make sense.

A personalist approach to diplomacy that goes case by case is not
necessarily a bad one. What works in one situation may not work in
another. But [when it comes to global efforts to control the spread of
nuclear weapons, [the double standard **inherent in Trump's
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[presents a **mortal
threat.**]{.underline} [Nonprolif]{.underline}]{.mark}[eration
[diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[requires sustained
coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** [among all the significant powers,
[even when]{.mark}]{.underline}, in a particular case, [their narrow
[interests do not align. **Making exceptions undermines the**
]{.mark}**very [enterprise]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of setting aside
narrow interests]{.underline} in support of broader ones, [and **[leaves
open the interpretation]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[sees nonprolif]{.mark}eration efforts [as]{.mark} little more than
[politics]{.mark}]{.underline} by other means.

U.S. [[diplomats]{.underline}]{.mark} have [**[long
struggled]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} [persuade China,
Russia, and other [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} that [U.S. concerns
about proliferation aren't]{.underline} really [about regime change.
[Although this has been **an uphill battle**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
strong [[sanctions]{.mark} placed [on Iran]{.mark} before the JCPOA
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} those imposed [on North [Korea]{.mark} today
[show]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[the value of]{.mark} sustained
[diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Now Trump has
dismissed]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[all [that as a
sham]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [throwing out one carefully negotiated
agreement and declaring another problem solved]{.underline} after a
single summit. **[[It's unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[China and

years]{.underline}. [[The result ma]{.mark}y even [be

The [[sanctions]{.mark} regimes [imposed on Iran and]{.mark} North

[coop]{.mark}eration [of]{.mark} many
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [including China

[[sanctions were **only** viable **insofar as**]{.mark} **the [U.S.
concerns]{.mark} about proliferation [were seen as
sincere]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Trump has made it clear that Iran's
adherence to the JCPOA doesn\'t win it any points with him---following
the rules doesn't matter. Trump has signaled that Washington's concern
about Iran's nuclear program is really just an excuse that justifies a
thinly veiled preference for regime change. And what could make that
clearer than the praise that Trump has heaped on Kim? The most dangerous
aspect of Trump's treatment of Iran and North Korea is not so much that
it breaks with U.S.diplomatic tradition---although it does---asthat it
may come to be seen as kind of continuity. [Trump's approach feeds the
narrative that U.S. talking points about the spread of nuclear weapons
are **little more than convenient fictions** that exist to enable other
foreign policy priorities.]{.underline}

### IL\-\--A2: Strict Standards Good

#### US obsession with strict standards is [counterproductive]{.underline} -- overly restrictive policy drives demand to less scrupulous suppliers

**Poneman 17** \-\-\-- Daniel B., former United States Deputy Secretary
of Energy from 2009 to 2014, Distinguished Fellow at the Paulson

[[A **chimerical** gold standard]{.underline}]{.mark}

How should US policy respond to this messy reality? History shows that
[a one-size-fits-all policy]{.underline} **[[does not
work]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Before 1974, a generally open-door approach
to promoting nuclear energy led to nonproliferation controls that were
too lax, as evidenced by the Indian test and a series of proposed
nuclear fuel cycle deals to build potentially weapon-supporting fuel
facilities in Brazil, Pakistan, South Korea, and Taiwan. On the other
hand, [an [overly restrictive policy to]{.mark}ward [peaceful nuclear
coop]{.mark}eration---insisting that other nations yield to
nonproliferation demands beyond what any other government
has]{.underline} ever [requested---[can be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[counterproductive]{.underline}**, [driving]{.underline}]{.mark}
[nuclear [business]{.mark} **[into]{.mark} the arms of [non-US
suppliers]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [The result is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[weakened]{.underline}]{.mark}** American nuclear industry
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[diminished]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[global [influence on]{.mark} safety and
[nonprolif]{.mark}eration.]{.underline}

Thus if the United States is going to preserve, much less enhance, its
global leadership on the issue of nuclear energy, [[American
policymakers **must overcome their bias** for
tough-sounding]{.underline} **[but unenforceable]{.underline}**
[demands]{.underline}]{.mark}. Why? Because lopsided demands for
concessions by suppliers only work in a sellers' market, and the global
nuclear market is anything but that. To the contrary, especially since
the global response to the 2011 Fukushima disaster was to push many
reactor projects either far into the future or off the table completely,
we now have a buyers' market internationally. Reactors put out for bid
become the subject of fierce competition between suppliers not only from
the United States but also Russia, China, France, Japan, and South
Korea. And of the 60 reactors under construction around the world today,
US vendors have won only four export sales. Reactors aside, our global
position as a nuclear fuel supplier is weaker still.

#### The US' ["gold standard" approach]{.underline} fails -- it [doesn't change countries' views]{.underline} but [risks prolif]{.underline} by [alienating partners]{.underline}, [dissuading voluntary pledges]{.underline}, and [questioning previous standards]{.underline}

**Poneman 17** \-\-\-- Daniel B., former United States Deputy Secretary

<https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/case-american-nuclear-leadership>

This reality has still not sunk in, at least not in Washington. Case in
point: Many [[observers]{.mark} argue]{.underline} that [any nation
seeking civil nuclear coop]{.underline}eration with the United States
[must make binding commitments to refrain from]{.underline} building
[facilities to enrich uranium or separate plutonium]{.underline}---the
two principal pathways to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon.
[They [enthusiastically point to the 123 Agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}
signed [[with the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rab **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**mirates in
2009, often referred to [[as the "gold standard"]{.mark} in terms of
nonprolif]{.underline}eration commitments, and argue that all future
civil nuclear cooperation agreements with other nations must include
these strict provisions.

Certainly the goal of minimizing the spread of those facilities is the
correct one. Unfortunately, [[proponents]{.mark} of this "gold standard"
[**delude themselves** into thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} that somehow
[[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[compelled Abu Dhabi to forswear
enrichment and reprocessing]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[In
fact,]{.underline}** [[the Emiratis]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[**already
decided** to do so]{.underline}]{.mark} **[on their own
volition]{.underline}**, [as they **explicitly declared**]{.underline}
[in a]{.underline}n April 2008 [white paper]{.underline} on the
country's still nascent nuclear program. The US government's role was
simply to insist that the Emiratis reflect their existing national
policy in the text of the 123 Agreement and convert it into a legally
binding pledge to the United States.

[[By taking a voluntary commitment]{.mark} of restraint [and turning it
into a triumph of]{.mark} American [coercion, Washington]{.mark}
essentially [made it]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[politically
impossible]{.underline}** [for any]{.underline}]{.mark} [self-respecting
[government to make a similar]{.mark} voluntary
[pledge]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[alienating]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[the very [governments it sought to influence.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[[Sanctimonious policies]{.underline} **[seldom
persuade]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[anyone,]{.underline}** [[and the
"gold standard" is]{.underline} **[no exception]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[Indeed]{.underline}[, **[no nation]{.underline}** [has accepted
that]{.underline}]{.mark} [[standard since]{.mark} the UAE]{.underline}
deal, [and it is likely that]{.underline} **[[none ever
will]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially after the United States itself
did not insist on imposing the "gold standard" on Iran, which, unlike
the UAE, did pursue a covert uranium enrichment program apparently aimed
at developing a nuclear weapons capability. Nor did the United States
impose the "gold standard" in the 123 Agreement it negotiated with India
in 2008, with strong bipartisan congressional support, even though New
Delhi actually had diverted US and Canadian assistance to build its
first nuclear explosive device, refused to limit its enrichment or
reprocessing activities, and built a sizable nuclear arsenal.

[[Nor do]{.mark} **any**]{.underline} of our [[competitors
demand]{.underline}]{.mark} that [prospective buyers accept [additional
restrictions]{.mark} beyond those required by global nonproliferation
norms.]{.underline} So these **[[US-only]{.mark} diplomatic
[demands]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[represent]{.mark} the functional
equivalent of [unilateral disarmament]{.mark}]{.underline}, when [[we
cannot even claim a moral high ground **without impugning the adequacy
of**]{.mark} **the international [nonprolif]{.mark}eration
[norms]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[worked]{.mark} so hard [to promote and]{.mark} that other governments
have agreed to [enforce]{.mark}.]{.underline}

To be clear, this is not to argue for reopening the Indian and Iranian
nuclear deals and seeking to impose the "gold standard" retroactively.
Those ships have sailed, and the United States must keep its word in
fulfilling existing commitments. But it does suggest that [[if
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[continues to
insist]{.underline}]{.mark} (except when it does not) [that [others
adhere to a **chimerical** "gold standard" as a condition of peaceful

Thus if the United States is going to preserve, much less enhance, its
global leadership on the issue of nuclear energy, American policymakers
must overcome their bias for tough-sounding but unenforceable demands.
Why? Because [[lopsided demands]{.mark} for concessions by
suppliers]{.underline} [**[only work in a sellers'
market]{.underline}**, [and the]{.underline}]{.mark} [global nuclear
[market is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[anything but
that]{.underline}**]{.mark}. To the contrary, [especially [since]{.mark}
the global response to]{.underline} the 2011
[[Fukushima]{.underline}]{.mark} disaster [was to push]{.underline} many
[reactor projects]{.underline} either far [into the future or off the
table completely, [we]{.mark} now [have a buyers' market]{.mark}
internationally. [Reactors]{.mark} put out for bid [become the subject
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[fierce competition]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline}]{.mark} [suppliers not only from

the [60]{.mark} reactors [under construction]{.mark}]{.underline} around
the world today, [[US vendors]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[won **only
four**]{.mark} **export sales**]{.underline}. [Reactors aside,
[our]{.mark} global [position as a]{.mark} nuclear [fuel supplier is
**weaker still**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In short, [[**far from** enjoying the]{.mark} kind of [dominance]{.mark}
that permits a supplier [to force]{.mark} customers to accept uniquely

**hanging onto**]{.mark} **its global [influence by a

This [[reality]{.underline} **[has still not sunk

nation]{.mark} seeking]{.underline} civil nuclear
[coop]{.underline}eration [with the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[**must** make
binding commitments to refrain from]{.mark}]{.underline} building
[[facilities to enrich uranium or separate
plutonium]{.underline}]{.mark}---the two principal pathways to produce
fissile material for a nuclear weapon. [[They]{.underline}
**[enthusiastically]{.underline}** [point to the 123
Agreement]{.underline}]{.mark} signed [[with the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rab
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**mirates in 2009, often [referred to [as the

commitments, [[and argue]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[**[all]{.underline}** [future]{.underline}]{.mark} [civil nuclear
[coop]{.mark}]{.underline}eration agreements with other nations [[must
include these **strict provisions.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Certainly the goal of minimizing the spread of those facilities is the
correct one. Unfortunately, [[proponents]{.mark} of this "gold standard"
[delude themselves into thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} that somehow
[[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[compelled Abu Dhabi to forswear
enrichment and reprocessing]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, the Emiratis
had already decided to do so on their own volition, as they explicitly
declared in an April 2008 white paper on the country's still nascent
nuclear program. The US government's role was simply to insist that the
Emiratis reflect their existing national policy in the text of the 123
Agreement and convert it into a legally binding pledge to the United
States.

### NPT\-\--A2: No Impact

**NPT collapses [nuclear war]{.underline}**

Journal 5-19-15,

[[The]{.mark} review of the]{.underline} Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty
([[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}) this month [[is a]{.mark} once every five
years chance to reaffirm and strengthen]{.underline} [[one of the
strongest international norms]{.underline}]{.mark}: that
[against]{.underline} the [prolif]{.underline}eration [and]{.underline}
[use]{.underline} [of nuclear tech]{.underline}nology [for military
means]{.underline}. [Representatives of [190
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} are gathered to examine the treaty itself
and [discuss new ways to increase global buy-in against nuclear
dangers.]{.underline} This time, they might do so in a critical new way.
[Israel [will be]{.mark} [at the table]{.mark} for the first time in 20
years]{.underline} as an observer only (having not signed the NPT), and
according to a senior Obama administration official, has agreed to begin
working with Arabs on an agenda for a conference to discuss a weapons of
mass destruction free zone in the Middle East. [This is [a dramatic
change]{.mark} from 2010]{.underline}, when Israel refused to even
consider the idea. [[Incremental]{.mark} diplomatic [wins]{.mark} like
this]{.underline} one [[lie at the core of the]{.mark} truly
transnational strategic interest]{.underline} [on the [path to
complete]{.mark} nuclear weapons [disarmament]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
is precisely why ensuring the peaceful use of nuclear technology must
remain a key component of all nations' foreign policy doctrines. Perhaps
one reason the NPT, and its review every five years, is often overlooked
by the general public is because at face value, everyone agrees more
nukes are a bad thing. However, [the NPT]{.underline}, and the
corresponding diplomatic collaboration surrounding nuclear weapons, [go
much deeper than simply halting the prolif]{.underline}eration of such
dangerous technology. [It is through this]{.underline} nearly universal
[treaty the next generation of world leaders wil]{.underline}l likely
[see nuclear disarmament]{.underline}, [avoid an open war with
Iran]{.underline} over its nuclear program, [and stop a]{.underline}
[Middle East nuclear arms race]{.underline} in its tracks. However, [[it
wasn\'t]{.mark} always [clear the NPT would be the resounding success it
is.]{.mark}]{.underline} In 1961 when Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion
told U.S. President John F. Kennedy that Israel\'s nuclear program at
Dimona was for peaceful purposes only, Kennedy's National Security
Council was simultaneously warning that by the 1970s there could be 40
nuclear weapon armed states (including Israel). If an America in the
future faced rampant nuclear threats and could not believe a
face-to-face conversation with a reliable ally, what could anyone trust?
There had to be a better way, and the NPT was the answer: Never trust,
always verify. In Israel\'s defense, the only NPT signatories who have
violated the treaty since adoption--- Iran, Iraq and Syria---have sworn
to destroy the Jewish state. Remaining a non-signatory to the NPT and
maintaining an opaque nuclear first strike nuclear capability was
strategically the right choice for Israel (regional de-stabilization be
damned), and one that could be revisited given their 2015 decision to
consider an agenda for a nuclear weapons free Middle East. Israel\'s
gambit to wait for the NPT to become as ironclad as it has paid
dividends that we can all reap both in June with a comprehensive
agreement between the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council (including Germany, a group colloquially referred to as the
P5+1) and Iran and well into the future. The defining trait of the NPT
is reframing the acquisition of nuclear weapons by a state from an act
of national pride circa 1960 to an act contrary to international law by
1970. Thankfully, today we operate in a world that accepts nuclear power
as a scientific pursuit but abhors its use for violence. This is also
why Iran\'s right to domestically enrich as a signatory to the NPT will
be a cornerstone of the P5+1 agreement that will be announced soon and
likely ratified by the first of July. This comprehensive agreement will
also implicitly underscore one of the pillars of the NPT: The gradual
demilitarization of nuclear technology. And lest critics make the
argument that the NPT can only be used to coerce pariah states like
Iran, consider the actions of the major powers. Since the NPT entered
into force, the United States has drastically reduced the number of
nuclear weapons in its stockpile by 80 percent and completely removed
multiple entry warheads from its nuclear strike capacity. In some
respects just as importantly, Washington is currently targeting the open
ocean; there is no longer a single ICBM aimed at the Russian Federation
and nuclear-armed, long-range strategic bombers have been removed from
daily nuclear alert. Russia has made similar progress, with both
commitments and demonstrated progress in reducing deployed warheads as
well as deployed and undeployed delivery vehicles. Moscow has also taken
the lead in other areas where the United States has lagged behind,
singing and ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. To be
sure, complications---including Russia's tendency to view their
remaining weapons as a counterweight to all NATO stockpiles rather than
simply that of the United States---still exist, but the fact remains
that [[the norm]{.mark} created by NPT has [reduced the potential for
nuclear disaster]{.mark} [across the globe]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
where has all that potential destruction gone? Fully 10% of electric
power in the United States over the last two decades came from
down-blended, highly enriched uranium earmarked for Russian megaton
nuclear bombs. Over 20,000 warheads (and their associated risk of
accidental launches) were removed from service all thanks the spirit of
the NPT. [The spirit of bilateral [coop]{.mark}eration [remains
strong]{.mark}; despite the tensions in Ukraine]{.underline}, [both [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Russia]{.underline}n]{.mark} Federation
[[are]{.mark} fully [implementing]{.mark} the terms of the New
[START]{.mark} treaty]{.underline}, [wherein each shares
data]{.underline} on the movement of strategic forces [and]{.underline}
both [engage in reciprocal inspections of military
facilities]{.underline}. [The NPT is]{.underline} [not just about
non-prolif]{.underline}eration; [it is a shift in mindset that nuclear
technology will be shared]{.underline} with those who want it
[for]{.underline} [peaceful purposes]{.underline} in return for
de-arming those who have militarized it. [It has been a resounding
victory for]{.underline} the idea of internationalism and the
fundamental idea that a community of nations can come together and,
through [mutually-reinforcing and]{.underline} [verifying
behavior]{.underline}, [make strategic choices]{.underline} [that defy
the self-serving nature of states in an anarchic system]{.underline}.
Moreover, [[it has been the bedrock of a norm that spawned
a]{.underline}]{.mark} range of bi- and [[multilateral measures to
protect]{.underline}]{.mark} the world [[against]{.underline}]{.mark}
the terrible risk of [[nuclear conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Collective continued nuclear demilitarization]{.underline} [is a win
for the diplomats of the world]{.underline}. Progress on the biggest
issues comes in small breaks, such as the Israeli decision to if not
pull a seat up to the table, at least pay close attention on the
sidelines. Through extraordinary burdens of verification and disclosure,
[the NPT will continue to make the world a safer place]{.underline}.

### NPT\-\--A2: No War

#### NPT collapse causes nuclear war

**Muller 8** (Harold, Director -- Peace Research Institute and Professor
of International Relations -- Frankfurt University, "The Future of
Nuclear Weapons in an Interdependent World", Washington Quarterly,
Spring, Lexis

[[The NPT is the cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation
regime]{.underline}]{.mark}. It rests on a bargain between
nuclear-weapon states and non-nuclear-weapon states. The latter agree to
refrain from acquiring nuclear weapons but are guaranteed the right to
develop civilian nuclear energy without constraints as long as they are
parties to the treaty in good standing. All parties are obliged to
engage in civilian nuclear cooperation to give this right substance, and
the nuclear-weapon states are committed to making serious moves toward
nuclear disarmament. Until 2000, the non-nuclear-weapon states,
particularly those belonging to the Non-Aligned Movement, were not
uncritical of the nuclear-weapon states\' record, but they were
satisfied that the process of disarmament was underway. The 2000 NPT
Review Conference brought the hard-fought compromise of the \"13 steps\"
on nuclear disarmament, a series of moderate, incremental measures that
would lead to some progress without questioning the nuclear-weapon
status of the five in the foreseeable future.
[^14^](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=bdd54216370e15df8fa26bde1111b584&docnum=8&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkAz&_md5=f6b9321740b257920320c7efec57cfcf&focBudTerms=china%20or%20chinese%21%20or%20beijing%20w/35%20aggress%21%20or%20conflict%21%20or%20war%20or%20creeping%20occupation%20w/20%20south%20china%20sea&focBudSel=all#fnote14)
Nevertheless, in 2005 the nuclear-weapon states, led by the United
States and to a certain degree by France, refused to recognize to what
they had agreed in 2000, having apparently come to the conclusion that
the concessions were too far-reaching. Among non-nuclear-weapon states,
there is now the strong impression that the NPT\'s Article VI, the
disarmament obligation, is dead in the eyes of the nuclear haves. [[With
the bargain shattered, the iron law of armament would
apply]{.underline}:]{.mark} the most powerful weapon of an era is
inevitably either had by none or by all. The present state of the
nuclear nonproliferation regime, combined with [the fundamental
insecurity]{.underline} of all states with whom the nuclear-weapon
states have unfriendly relations, [seems to be a dangerous precondition
for rampant proliferation]{.underline}. A world populated by many
nuclear-weapon states poses grave dangers. [[Regional conflicts could
escalate to the nuclear level]{.mark}. The optimistic expectation
of]{.underline} a universal law according to which nuclear
[deterrence]{.underline} prevents all wars
[^15^](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=bdd54216370e15df8fa26bde1111b584&docnum=8&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVtz-zSkAz&_md5=f6b9321740b257920320c7efec57cfcf&focBudTerms=china%20or%20chinese%21%20or%20beijing%20w/35%20aggress%21%20or%20conflict%21%20or%20war%20or%20creeping%20occupation%20w/20%20south%20china%20sea&focBudSel=all#fnote15)
[rests on scant historical evidence and is dangerously naive. [Nuclear
uses]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}in one part of the world [[could
trigger \"catalytic war\" between greater powers]{.underline}]{.mark},
drawing them into smaller regional conflicts, particularly if tensions
are high. This was always a fear during the Cold War, and it motivated
nonproliferation policy in the first place. Moreover, the more states
that possess nuclear weapons and related facilities, the more points of
access are available to terrorists.

### NPT\-\--A2: Other Checks

#### NPT collapse unravels [all arms control]{.underline} and causes CBW prolif

**Mutimer 3** (David Mutimer, Professor of Political Science -- York
University, "Part I: Denuclearization And The Threat To The NPT",
2-7-2003, <http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/arms/nuclear/section05-en.asp>)

[[The NPT is]{.underline}]{.mark} considered to be [[the \'lynchpin\'
of]{.mark} the [broad efforts]{.mark} aimed at
[combatting]{.mark}]{.underline} weapons [[proliferation of **all
kinds**. The]{.mark} proliferation [agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} now
[[encompasses]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [[all]{.mark} forms of
weapons, conventional and]{.underline} [[w]{.underline}]{.mark}eapons of
[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}ass [[d]{.underline}]{.mark}estruction [as well
as small arms]{.underline} and light weapons. Nevertheless, [[nuclear
non-prolif]{.mark}eration [is]{.mark}]{.underline} seen as [[the
**central element** in efforts to control]{.mark} the spread
of]{.underline} weapons and [[related tech]{.mark}nologies, [and the NPT
is]{.mark}]{.underline}, in turn, [the **centrepiece** of]{.underline}
the range of [efforts]{.underline} designed [to prevent]{.underline}
[the spread of nuclear]{.underline} weapons [technology. Therefore, the
survival]{.underline} and continued robustness [of the NPT
is]{.underline} seen as [[**crucial** to proliferation control]{.mark}.
The argument linking the NPT to broader efforts at proliferation control
was deployed]{.underline} to good effect [in]{.underline} the run-up to
[the 1995]{.underline} NPT [Review]{.underline} and Extension
Conference, producing a strong endorsement for the indefinite extension
of the NPT. The idea of an indefinite extension was not uncontested in
1995, despite the arguments of the United States and its allies,
including Canada, that only an indefinite extension of the NPT would
secure the future of proliferation control efforts. The Non-Aligned
Movement in general, and India in particular (though as a non-Party to
the NPT, India had no standing at the conference) led the opposition to
the indefinite extension. Several alternatives were proposed to
indefinite extension, each of which was a variation on a single theme.
That theme is best expressed as the \'rolling extension\' option. The
idea of a rolling extension grew from the language of Article X.2 of the
NPT, which required a decision on the extension of the Treaty, either
indefinitely or for an additional fixed period or periods. The various
rolling extension options picked up on the possibility of extending the
NPT for additional periods, and proposed extending the NPT subject to
periodic review as the Treaty moved from one period to the next. The
reason for these proposals was to allow for continued pressure to be
brought to bear on the nuclear weapons states (NWS) in general and the
United States and its allies in particular for movement on nuclear
disarmament. The opponents of indefinite extension saw the West\'s
preferred option as institutionalising the inequality of the NPT, and at
the same time insulating the nuclear weapon states from any pressure for
further advance on their Article VI commitments to nuclear disarmament.
It would seem that the opponents had a point. In anticipation of the
Review and Extension Conference, the United States ended its
long-standing opposition to a Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, and
spearheaded the campaign to complete the
CTBT.[1](http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/arms/nuclear/section05-en.asp?#1)
With the indefinite extension successfully achieved, we now approach the
next NPT review conference with the CTBT barely alive in the United
States Senate, and Canada\'s Minister of Foreign Affairs publicly taking
the US President to task for failing to advance the agenda of nuclear
disarmament. For example, in two speeches delivered in Massachusetts on
October 22, 1999, Minister Axworthy expressed concern \"that the United
States is retreating from its traditional leadership role in the field
of nuclear disarmament and arms
control.\"[2](http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/arms/nuclear/section05-en.asp?#2)
It is too late to reject the indefinite extension option and to
recognise the validity of the concerns of the non-aligned states.
However, indefinite extension does not guarantee the continued survival
and robustness of either the proliferation control regime generally or
even the NPT itself. It is of tremendous concern that the only open
declarations of new nuclear weapon state status since the 1968 signing
of the NPT came soon after the 1995 extension decision. Furthermore, the
NPT still allows for states to withdraw on three month\'s notice
(Article X.1). [The NPT is not secure, and as a consequence, the broad
efforts to control the spread of weapons]{.underline} and related
technologies [is not secure]{.underline}. What is more, [the development
of [a proliferation control agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} in the past
decade [[has **tied together all efforts** at arms
control]{.underline}]{.mark} and disarmament [[in a **large
network**]{.mark} linked by]{.underline} the threat of
[\'proliferation\']{.underline}. [This means that]{.underline} not only
are the NPT and proliferation control efforts insecure, but so are [[the
**full range** of arms control]{.underline}]{.mark} and disarmament
[[measures]{.underline}]{.mark} that have been put in place or [[are
under negotiation]{.underline}]{.mark} or discussion. Thus, even for
those who object to the present proliferation control agenda, the threat
to the NPT and the nuclear nonproliferation regime is of considerable
concern.[3](http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/arms/nuclear/section05-en.asp?#3)
The threat to the NPT stems, ultimately, from the central contradiction
of the treaty itself: the legitimation of five nuclear weapon states in
a treaty outlawing nuclear arming of all other states. Therefore, the
way to combat the threat to the NPT is to continue to redress this
fundamental inequality; it is to work towards nuclear disarmament - in
good faith, even if complete nuclear disarmament is not achievable in
the short to medium term - as NPT States Party are obliged to under the
terms of the NPT.

### Prolif\-\--A2: No Domino

#### Domino theory empirically verifiable and logical because of the three-fold motives for proliferation -- '64 Chinese testing

[Is]{.underline} the [nuclear domino theory historically
valid?]{.underline} Despite its longstanding centrality to thinking on
nuclear proliferation amongst scholars and policymakers, in recent years
a revisionist consensus has emerged in opposition to this traditional
view. [[Based on]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[analysis of historical
evidence]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} the aftermath of
[[the]{.mark} 1964 [Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [[test]{.mark},
this article argues]{.underline} that [[scholars]{.mark} have
[go]{.mark}ne [too far in rejecting]{.mark} the nuclear [domino
theory]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Reactive prolif]{.underline}eration [has
been]{.underline} **[more prevalent]{.underline}** [than]{.underline}
commonly [believed, and [while]{.mark}]{.underline} it is true that
[[only India]{.mark} [acquired]{.mark}]{.underline} a nuclear arsenal
[in response to]{.underline} the [Chinese test,]{.underline} to a
significant extent [[this is]{.mark} precisely
[because]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[was aware of]{.mark} the danger of
[reactive prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** and worked to stop it.
Finally, the **[historical evidence]{.underline}**
[suggests]{.underline} that the nuclear [domino [theory is compatible
with]{.mark}]{.underline} both [**[domestic and prestige]{.underline}**
[motivations]{.underline}]{.mark} for proliferation [[in addition
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[security]{.underline}]{.mark} motives
normally associated with the theory. When one state acquires nuclear
weapons, do other states inevitably follow? The [[belief]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the affirmative (hereafter termed [the nuclear domino
theory]{.underline}) [[was]{.underline}]{.mark} once **[an article of
[faith]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[among]{.underline}]{.mark} world
[[leaders]{.mark} and analysts]{.underline} of nuclear proliferation. In
the last decade, however, a growing chorus of scholars has attacked the
validity of the nuclear domino theory from a diverse array of
methodological and theoretical perspectives. 1 The goal of this article
is to contest this emerging revisionist consensus. More specifically,
the article advances three primary claims: [(1)]{.underline} that
[[reactive prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}eration behavior in the form of
nuclear exploration and pursuit [[has been]{.underline} **[more
common]{.underline}**]{.mark} [than]{.underline} recent [scholarship has
acknowledged]{.underline}; [(2)]{.underline} that, [contrary
to]{.underline} [common belief]{.underline}, the nuclear [domino theory
is compatible with a multicausal approach]{.underline} to proliferation,
embracing security, domestic, and normative motivations; and (3) most
importantly, that US nonproliferation policy has played a central role
in rendering nuclear domino predictions self-defeating.

### Prolif\-\--A2: No War

#### Asian prolif causes nuclear war 

Stephen J. **Cimbala 15**, Distinguished Professor of Political Science
at Pennsylvania State University Brandywine, *The New Nuclear Disorder:
Challenges to Deterrence and Strategy*, 2015, pp. 59-63

Although the construct or policy option of a preventive nuclear war
became institutionally unthinkable in Washington and in Moscow, [[the
possibility of inadvertent nuclear war]{.mark} or escalation to nuclear
from conventional war was **very real during the Cold
War**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} legacy [has [**carried forward**
into]{.mark} [the]{.mark} post-Cold War and [twenty-first
century]{.mark} world]{.underline}. The term "inadvertent" means
something other than "accidental" war, such as the possibility of a test
misfire or other technology failure that leads to a war. [Inadvertent
nuclear war is the result of an unforeseen combination of human and
technical factors]{.underline}, pulling both sides in a nuclear crisis
over the brink despite their shared interest in avoiding war.¶ The
likelihood of inadvertent nuclear war between two states is based on
their political intentions, military capabilities, approaches to crisis
management, the personalities of leaders, standard operating procedures
for the management of nuclear forces during peacetime and in crisis, and
other variables.16 A decision for nuclear preemption is so irrevocable
that leaders will want as much intelligence as possible relative to the
plans and actions of their opponent. Unfortunately, [inside dope on [the
opponent's]{.mark} political [thinking and]{.mark} military [planning
may be hard to come by]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [under the exigent
pressures of crisis]{.underline}. Therefore, [[states may infer]{.mark}
the other side's [intentions]{.mark} from the disposition of its
forces]{.underline}, from [the behavior of its command, control,
communications and intelligence systems, or [from **guesswork**]{.mark}
based on past experience]{.underline}.¶ For example: during Able Archer
83, a NATO command and communications exercise testing procedures for
the release of alliance nuclear weapons in November 1983, there was an
apparent mind set among some Soviet intelligence officials that led them
to conclude (temporarily) that the exercise might be the "real thing":
an actual set of preparatory moves for NATO nuclear release and a
possible first strike against Soviet forces and installations in
Europe.17 The pessimistic Soviet interpretations of Able Archer were not
universally shared among their intelligence officers, but some of the
alarmism arose from Soviet military doctrine that foresaw the conversion
of an exercise simulating an attack into a real attack as one possible
path to war.18¶ Another example of the difficulty of reading the other
side's intentions during a crisis occurred during the Cuban missile
crisis of 1962. A second letter from Khrushchev to Kennedy on October
27, more demanding in its terms for settlement compared to an earlier
letter the previous day, caused some ExComm deliberators to wonder
whether Khrushchev had been overruled by a hostile faction of the Soviet
Presidium. Robert Kennedy noted that "The change in the language and
tenor of the letters from Khrushchev indicated confusion within the
Soviet Union, but there was confusion among us as well."19 Fortunately,
in both the NATO "Able Archer" exercise and in the Cuban crisis, the
most pessimistic assumptions were proved incorrect before leaders could
act on them.¶ A post-Cold War example of a scenario for inadvertent
nuclear war occurred in January 1995 during the launch of a Norwegian
scientific rocket for the purpose of studying the Aurora borealis. The
initial phase of the rocket's trajectory resembled that of a ballistic
missile launched from a nuclear submarine and possibly headed for
Russian territory. Russian early warning systems detected the launch and
passed the information to military headquarters. Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, the defense minister and the chief of the Russian general staff
were connected via their emergency communication network, and the
Russian President for the first time opened his secure briefcase or
"football" with nuclear codes for launch authorization. The crisis
passed when the rocket trajectory eventually veered away from any
possible threat to Russia. The operational misinterpretation of the
Norwegian rocket launch was made possible by an earlier bureaucratic
mistake. Norwegian officials had notified the Russian foreign ministry
well in advance of the launch date that the rocket test was scheduled
and of its mission. For unknown reasons, the Russian foreign ministry
failed to pass that information to the defense ministry or other
military headquarters in time to avoid confusion.¶ The Future: Issues of
Concern¶ [If [the possibility existed of]{.mark} a [mistaken preemption
during]{.mark} and immediately after [the Cold War]{.mark}, between the
experienced nuclear forces and command systems of America and Russia,
then [it may be]{.mark} a matter of [even more concern with]{.mark}
regard to [states with]{.mark} **newer and [more opaque forces and
command systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition, [the Americans
and]{.underline} Soviets (and then [Russians]{.underline}) [had a great
deal of experience getting to know one another's military]{.underline}
operational [proclivities and]{.underline} doctrinal
[idiosyncrasies]{.underline}: including those that might influence the
decision for or against war.¶ Another consideration, relative to nuclear
stability in the present century, is that the Americans and their NATO
allies shared with the Soviets and Russians a commonality of culture and
historical experience. [Future threats]{.underline} to American or
Russian security from weapons of mass destruction [may be presented by
states or non-state actors motivated by cultural and social
predispositions not easily understood by those in the West nor subject
to favorable manipulation during a crisis]{.underline}.¶ [[The **spread
of nuclear weapons in Asia**]{.underline}]{.mark} (including those parts
of the Middle East with geostrategic proximity or reach into Asia)
[[presents]{.mark} a complicated mosaic of possibilities in this
regard]{.underline}. [States with]{.underline} nuclear forces of
[variable force structure, operational experience, and command-control
systems will be thrown into [a matrix of]{.mark} complex political,
social and cultural [cross-currents **contributory to** ]{.mark}**the
possibility of [war]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In addition to the existing
nuclear powers **[[in Asia, others may seek nuclear weapons if they feel
threatened]{.underline}]{.mark}** by regional rivals or hostile
alliances. Containment of nuclear proliferation in Asia is a desirable
political objective for all of the obvious reasons. Nevertheless, [the
present century is unlikely to see the nuclear hesitancy or risk
aversion that marked the Cold War]{.underline}: in part, because the
military and political discipline imposed by the Cold War superpowers no
longer exists, but also because [states in Asia have new aspirations for
regional or global respect.]{.underline}20¶ The spread of ballistic
missiles and other nuclear capable delivery systems [[in
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}, or in the Middle East with reach into Asia,
is especially dangerous because [[plausible adversaries live close
together and are **already engaged in** ]{.mark}**ongoing
[disputes]{.mark}** about territory or other issues]{.underline}. The
Cold War Americans and Soviets required missiles and airborne delivery
systems of intercontinental range to strike at one another's vitals. But
short range ballistic missiles or fighter-bombers suffice for India and
Pakistan to launch attacks at one another with potentially "strategic"
effects. China shares borders with Russia, North Korea, India and
Pakistan; Russia, with China and North Korea; India, with Pakistan and
China; Pakistan, with India and China; and so on.¶ [The [short flight
times]{.mark} of ballistic missiles]{.underline} between the cities or
military forces of contiguous states [[means]{.mark} that **very [little
time will be available]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} warning and attack
[assessment]{.mark} by the defender]{.underline}.
[[Conventional]{.mark}ly armed [missiles could]{.mark}]{.underline}
easily [[be mistaken for]{.mark} a]{.underline} tactical
[[nuclear]{.mark} first use]{.underline}. Fighter-bombers appearing over
the horizon could just as easily be carrying nuclear weapons as
conventional ordnance. In addition to the challenges posed by shorter
flight times and uncertain weapons loads, [potential victims of nuclear
attack in Asia may also have [first strike vulnerable]{.mark} forces and
command-control [systems]{.mark} that [increase]{.mark} decision
[pressures]{.mark} [for]{.mark} **rapid, and possibly mistaken,
[retaliation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.¶ [[This]{.mark} potpourri of
possibilities **[challenges conventional wisdom about]{.mark} nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark}** [and proliferation]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
part of policy makers and academic theorists. For policy makers in the
United States and NATO, [spreading nuclear]{.underline} and other
[weapons]{.underline} of mass destruction in Asia [could profoundly
shift the geopolitics of mass destruction]{.underline} from a European
center of gravity (in the twentieth century) to an Asian and/or Middle
Eastern center of gravity (in the present century).21 [This would
profoundly shake up prognostications]{.underline} to the effect [that
wars of mass destruction are now passé]{.underline}, on account of the
emergence of the "Revolution in Military Affairs" and its encouragement
of information-based warfare.22 Together with this, there has emerged
the argument that large scale war between states or coalitions of
states, as opposed to varieties of unconventional warfare and failed
states, are exceptional and potentially obsolete.23 The spread of WMD
and ballistic missiles in Asia could overturn these expectations for the
obsolescence or marginalization of major interstate warfare.

[Even ideologically]{.underline}, or religiously, [highly charged
[leaderships]{.mark}]{.underline} [[may be aware]{.mark} of the
[dangers]{.mark} inherent in nuclear war [and behave
rationally]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [such awareness and [rational
decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline} processes
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[necessary but not]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[sufficient]{.underline}]{.mark} condition. [[Nuclear confrontation
may]{.mark} not [be the result of]{.mark} some irrational but
premeditated decision]{.underline} by leaders [to initiate a nuclear
strike, but of]{.underline} [[faulty intel]{.mark}ligence, [command, and
control in escalatory situations]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such
situations, it appears that the [[c]{.mark}ommand [and]{.mark}
[c]{.mark}ontrol structures that may develop [in new nuclear states in
the Middle East are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[likely to exacerbate]{.mark}
the [dangers inherent in escalation]{.mark}]{.underline} and
brinkmanship, [[and]{.mark} to]{.underline}
[[result]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately [[in]{.underline} [perennial

### Prolif\-\--A2: No War\-\--Checks

#### Structural checks on conflict don't apply to Northeast Asia

[[Northeast Asia is]{.mark} the **[least
developed]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} all [[Asia\'s
sub-regions in terms of]{.underline}]{.mark} identity and
[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}. 12 This is
**[[despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[deepening economic
interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark} among sub-regional states (with the
notable exception of North Korea). [Trade between northeast Asian states
has been growing steadily]{.underline} since the 1997 regional economic
crisis. Countries have increasingly critical direct investments,
[exemplified by]{.underline} the large-scale [Japanese and South Korean
investment]{.underline} in the information technology production
networks in the Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, and the
Bohai---Yellow Sea region. 3 **[[While economic relations are]{.mark}
very [warm]{.mark}]{.underline}** among northeast Asia\'s states,
**[[political relations are distant]{.mark} and cold]{.underline}**,
[[which has]{.underline} **[major implications]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} **[security dynamics]{.underline}**]{.mark} in this
sub-region. **[[Territorial disputes run]{.mark} deep]{.underline}** [in
this part of Asia [and **multilat**]{.mark}**eral [institutions]{.mark}
have [played]{.mark}**]{.underline} almost **[[no role in mitigating
security dilemmas]{.underline}]{.mark}** between states. Talk of a
Northeast Asian Security Dialogue gained little traction in the 1990s
and the Six Party Talks have failed to deliver any real outcomes in
achieving effective confidence-building measures, let alone placing any
meaningful constraints on North Korea\'s nuclear program. Any sustained
dialogue between sub-regional states on the security challenges
engendering mistrust has proven elusive. Ironically, the most
substantive dialogue between China, Japan, and South Korea has taken
place under the rubric of a southeast Asia-based institution, ASEAN-+3.
[[Inter-Korean and inter-Chinese tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
were deliberately fanned by the superpowers during the Cold War, have
[[inhibited]{.underline}]{.mark} any meaningful [[resolution
of]{.underline}]{.mark} outstanding **[[territorial

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy

#### Boosting US [nonprolif credibility]{.underline} blocks [global nuclear energy]{.underline} -- [extinction]{.underline} via [climate change]{.underline} 

**Mueller 8** (John, Professor of Political Science at Ohio State,
7/16/8, "The Costs and Consequences of Efforts to Prevent
Proliferation,"
<https://politicalscience.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/APSA08.pdf>)

[**[Nonproliferation efforts]{.mark}** worldwide]{.underline} also
[**hamper worldwide economic development** by **[increas]{.mark}ing the
effective [costs of]{.mark} developing [nuclear
energy]{.mark}**]{.underline}\--sometimes even [**[making them
prohibitive]{.mark}** for some countries]{.underline}. As countries
grow, they require ever increasing amounts of power. Any measure that
limits their ability to acquire this vital commodity\--or increases its
price\--effectively slows economic growth and essentially kills people
by reducing the gains in life expectancy commonly afforded by economic
development. [[The
**N**]{.underline}]{.mark}on-**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**roliferation
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty specifically [[guarantees]{.mark} to
signing nonnuclear countries \"the fullest possible exchange of
technology\" for the development of [peaceful nuclear power.
However]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Richard Betts points out, [[this
**rationale has been undermined** by]{.mark} the development of [a
\"nuclear suppliers cartel\" which has worked to \"cut off trade in
tech]{.mark}nology [for reprocessing]{.mark} plutonium [or
enriching]{.mark}]{.underline} uranium,\" thereby reducing the NPT to
\"a simple demand to the nuclear weapons have-nots to remain so.\"49

More broadly the nonproliferation quest has from time to time boosted
international oil prices to the detriment of almost all the countries in
the world except for the potential proliferator.

[[Because nuclear power does not emit
**g**]{.mark}reen**[h]{.mark}**ouse **[g]{.mark}**ase[**s**, it is an
obvious]{.mark} potential [candidate for]{.mark} helping with the

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy\-\--A2: No Impact

#### Warming causes extinction -- action now key -- nuclear resource wars, ag collapse, sea level rise, severe weather, biod loss, disease, ocean acidification -- focus on low probability, high magnitude components good

-Says on-balance CO2 benefits not worth it for ag

**Weart 15** \-\-\-- Spencer R., former Director of the Center for
History of Physics of the American Institute of Physics, B.A. in Physics
(Cornell), Ph.D. in Physics and Astrophysics (Colorado -- Boulder),
physics professor specializing in atmosphere, the sun, and space-based
instruments (Caltech), widely published and cited author on the history
of climate change and the associated science, "The Discovery of Global
Warming: The Impacts of Climate Change," American Institute of Physics,
February, <http://www.aip.org/history/climate/impacts.htm>

There was an even more sobering way to frame climate change --- as a
security threat. For half a century, forward-looking military officers
had considered with increasing concern what global warming might mean in
their area of responsibility. They would surely be called upon, for
example, if weather disasters multiplied. In 2003, [[defense]{.mark}
intellectuals]{.underline} in the Pentagon [commissioned a
report]{.underline} on \"An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and its
Implications for United States National Security.\" As reported in a
leak to the press, the [authors [warned]{.mark}]{.underline} of a risk
[that \"mega-droughts, famine and widespread [rioting will
erupt]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[across the
world]{.underline}**]{.mark}\.... [abrupt [climate change could
bring]{.mark} the planet to the **edge of [anarchy]{.mark}** [as
countries **develop a nuclear threat** to]{.mark}]{.underline} defend
and [[secure]{.mark} dwindling food,]{.underline} [water and
energy]{.underline} [[supplies]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" The [authors
concluded]{.underline} that \"[the threat]{.underline} to global
stability vastly [eclipses]{.underline} that of
[terrorism]{.underline}.\" The report was strikingly similar to the CIA
report prepared three decades before (see above). Again the specific
\"worst-case\" scenario, an abrupt change in ocean circulation, was
something scientists considered extremely unlikely. By now, however,
[impact studies]{.underline} had [sketched out a range of]{.underline}
more [plausible scenarios that looked bad enough]{.underline}. If you
thought like a military officer, used to considering worst cases, [the
IPCC\'s approach]{.underline} --- concentrating on what everyone could
agree was likely, while [[ignoring]{.mark} less likely but still
[possible scenarios --- was]{.mark}]{.underline} not \"conservative\" at
all, but **[[irresponsible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Through the early
2000s, social scientists and historians vigorously debated whether
climate change really could provoke civil unrest and warfare. [A 2013
[review]{.mark} of **many** papers [concluded]{.mark}]{.underline} that
strong [departures from normal [climate]{.mark} conditions]{.underline}
(droughts, heat waves, etc.) [indeed [brought
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, both **[[domestic and
international]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Many [well-informed military
officers and]{.underline} other [national security experts]{.underline},
along with many political leaders and a majority of the world's public,
now [believe]{.underline}d that the [possible [impacts]{.mark} of global
warming **[rank]{.mark}ed [among the most dangerous]{.mark} long-term
risks that [civilization face]{.mark}d**]{.underline}.(21\*) What do we
know about the impacts of global warming? [A large body of]{.underline}
scientific [studies, exhaustively reviewed]{.underline}, has [produced a
long list of possibilities]{.underline}. Nobody can say that any of the
items on the list are certain to happen. But the world\'s [climate
experts]{.underline} almost [all agree]{.underline} that the
[[impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} listed [below [are more]{.mark} [likely
than not]{.mark} to happen.]{.underline} For some items, the
[probabilities range up to **almost certain**]{.underline}. Consequences
will vary by region; some places will at first be little affected,
except indirectly, while other places will be affected much worse than
the average. The following are the likely consequences of warming by two
or three degrees Celsius --- that is, what we may expect if humanity
manages to begin restraining its emissions soon, so that greenhouse
gases do not rise beyond twice the pre-industrial level. Without strong
action the doubling will come well before the end of this century,
bringing the planet to temperatures not seen since the spread of
agriculture. [By 2007, many]{.underline} of the [predicted changes were
observed]{.underline} to be actually happening. For details see reports
referenced in this footnote: (22) \* [Most places will]{.underline}
continue to get [warm]{.underline}er, especially at night and in winter.
The temperature change will benefit some regions while harming others
--- for example, patterns of tourism will shift. The [warmer winters
will improve]{.underline} health and [agriculture in some areas, but
[globally]{.mark},]{.underline} mortality will rise and [[food]{.mark}
supplies [will be endangered due]{.mark} [to]{.mark} more frequent and
[extreme]{.mark} summer [heat]{.mark} waves]{.underline} and other
effects. [[Regions]{.mark} not directly harmed [will
suffer]{.mark}]{.underline} indirectly from [[higher]{.mark} food
[prices and]{.mark} a press of [refugees]{.mark}]{.underline} from
afflicted regions. \* [[Sea levels will]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to
[rise]{.underline} for many centuries. [The last time the planet was 3°C
warmer]{.underline} than now, the [sea level was]{.underline} at least
[6 meters]{.underline} (20 feet) [higher]{.underline}.(23) [That
[submerge]{.mark}d coastlines **where many [millions]{.mark} of people
now live**]{.underline}, including cities from New York to Shanghai. The
rise will probably be so gradual that later generations can simply
abandon their parents\' homes, but [a ruinously swift rise **cannot be
entirely ruled out**.]{.underline} Meanwhile [storm surges will cause
emergencies]{.underline}. \* [[Weather]{.underline}]{.mark} patterns
[[will keep changing]{.underline} [toward]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[[intensified]{.underline}]{.mark} water cycle with stronger [[floods
and droughts]{.underline}]{.mark}. Most [regions now subject to droughts
will]{.underline} probably [get drier]{.underline} (because of warmth as
well as less precipitation), and most wet regions will get wetter.
[Extreme weather events will become more frequent and
worse.]{.underline} In particular, storms with more intense rainfall are
liable to bring worse floods. Some places will get more snowstorms, but
most mountain glaciers and winter snowpack will shrink, jeopardizing
important water supply systems. Each of these things has already begun
to happen in some regions.(24) \* [[Ecosystems will be stressed]{.mark},
although some]{.underline} managed agricultural and forestry systems
[might benefit]{.underline} in the first decades of warming. [Uncounted
**[valuable species]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [especially in the Arctic,
mountain areas, and tropical seas, [must shift]{.mark}]{.underline}
their ranges. [[Many]{.mark} that cannot **will [face
extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A variety of [pests and tropical
[diseases are expected to spread]{.mark} to warmed regions]{.underline}.
These problems have already been observed in numerous places. \*
[Increased carbon dioxide]{.underline} levels [will affect biological
systems independent of climate change]{.underline}. [Some [crops will be
fertilized, **as will**]{.mark} **some invasive
[weeds]{.mark}**]{.underline} (the balance of benefit vs. harm is
uncertain). The [[oceans will]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to
[[become]{.underline}]{.mark} markedly [more
[acidic]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[gravely
endangering]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**coral reefs,** and]{.underline}
probably [harming]{.underline} fisheries and other [[marine
life]{.mark}.]{.underline} \* [There will be significant unforeseen
impacts. Most]{.underline} of these will probably be [harmful, since
human]{.underline} and natural systems [are well adapted to the
present]{.underline} climate. The climate system and ecosystems are
complex and only partly understood, so there is a chance that the
impacts will not be as bad as predicted. There is a similar chance of
impacts grievously worse than predicted. [[If]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[CO2]{.underline} level [keeps rising]{.underline} to well beyond twice
the pre-industrial level along with a rise of other greenhouse gases[**,
as must inevitably happen if [we do not take]{.mark} strong [action
soon]{.mark}**, the [results will]{.mark} certainly [be
worse]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Under]{.underline}]{.mark} a \"[[business
as usual]{.underline}]{.mark}\" scenario, [calculations give even
odds]{.underline} that global [[temperature will rise
5°C]{.underline}]{.mark} or more by the end of the century ---
[[causing]{.mark} a radical reorganization and [impoverishment
of]{.mark} many of the [ecosystems that **sustain** ]{.mark}**our
[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.(25) All this is projected to
happen to people who are now alive. [What of the]{.underline} more
[distant future]{.underline}? [[If emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}
continue to [[rise]{.underline}]{.mark} for a century --- whether
[[because]{.mark} we fail to rein them]{.underline} in, [or because we
set off [an **unstoppable feedback**]{.mark} **loop**]{.underline} in
which the warming itself causes ever more greenhouse gases to be
evaporated into the air --- then the [[gases will reach a level]{.mark}
that the Earth has [not seen]{.mark} s[in]{.mark}ce [tens of millions of
years]{.mark} ago]{.underline}. The [consequences will take]{.underline}
several [centuries to be fully realized]{.underline}, as the Earth
settles into its new state. It is probable that, as in the distant
geological eras with high CO2, [sea levels will be]{.underline} many
[tens of meters higher and]{.underline} the average global [temperature
will soar]{.underline} far above the present value: a [planet **grossly
unlike** the one to which the human species is adapted.]{.underline}

#### Climate change causes extinction and outweighs everything

Technologies (Phil, PhD candidate @ Rice University in tropical
conservation biology, Op-ed: Climate Change Is the Most Urgent
Existential Risk, <http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/Torres20160807>)

[Humanity faces a number of formidable challenges]{.underline} this
century. [Threats]{.underline} to our collective survival [stem
from]{.underline} [asteroids]{.underline} and comets, supervolcanoes,
global [pandemics]{.underline}, [climate change]{.underline},
biodiversity loss, [nuclear weapons]{.underline},
[biotechnology]{.underline}, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and
artificial superintelligence. With such threats in mind, an informal
survey conducted by the Future of Humanity Institute placed the
probability of human extinction this century at 19%. To put this in
perspective, it means that the average American is more than a thousand
times more likely to die in a human extinction event than a plane
crash.\* So, given limited resources, which risks should we prioritize?
Many intellectual leaders, including Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking, and
Bill Gates, have suggested that artificial superintelligence constitutes
one of the most significant risks to humanity. And this may be correct
in the long-term. But I would argue that two other risks, namely
**[[climate]{.mark} change]{.underline}** and biodiveristy
[loss]{.underline}, [[should **take priority**]{.underline}]{.mark}
right now [over]{.underline} **[every other known threat]{.underline}**.
Why? [Because [these]{.mark} ongoing [catastrophes]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}**[in slow-motion]{.underline}** [will [frame our **existential
predicament**]{.mark}]{.underline} on Earth not just for the rest of
this century, but [for]{.underline} literally **[thousands of
years]{.underline}** to come. As such, [[they]{.underline}]{.mark} [have
the capacity to **[raise]{.mark} or lower** [the **probability of other
risks**]{.mark} **scenarios**]{.underline} [unfolding]{.underline}.
Multiplying Threats Ask yourself the following: [are [wars]{.mark} more
or less likely in a world marked by **extreme weather
events**]{.underline}, **[megadroughts]{.underline}**, **[food supply
disruptions]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[sea-level
rise]{.underline}**? [Are [terrorist attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[more]{.mark} or less [likely]{.mark} in a world beset]{.underline} by
[**[the collapse of global ecosystems]{.underline}**, **[agricultural
failures]{.underline}**, **[economic uncertainty]{.underline}**]{.mark},
and political instability? Both [government officials and scientists
agree]{.underline} that the answer is **["more likely."]{.underline}**
For example, the current Director of the CIA, John
[Brennan]{.underline}, recently [identified]{.underline} "the impact of
[climate change]{.underline}" [as one of the "[deeper causes of this
rising instability"]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
countries like **[[Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[Iraq]{.underline}**, **[Yemen]{.underline}**,
**[Libya]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Similarly, the former Secretary of
Defense, Chuck [Hagel]{.underline}, has [described climate change as a
**"threat multiplier"**]{.underline} with "the potential to exacerbate
many of the challenges we are dealing with today --- from infectious
disease to terrorism." The Department of Defense has also affirmed a
connection. In a 2015 report, it states, "Global [[climate change will
aggravate]{.underline}]{.mark} problems such as
[**[poverty]{.underline}**, **[social tensions]{.underline}**]{.mark},
environmental degradation, [**[ineffectual leadership]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[weak]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[political
[institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that threaten
stability]{.underline} in a number of countries." Scientific studies
have further shown a connection between the environmental crisis and
violent conflicts. For example, a 2015 paper in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences argues that climate change was a causal
factor behind the record-breaking 2007-2010 drought in Syria. This
drought led to a mass migration of farmers into urban centers, which
fueled the 2011 Syrian civil war. Some observers, including myself, have
suggested that this struggle could be the beginning of World War III,
given the complex tangle of international involvement and overlapping
interests. The study's conclusion is also significant because the Syrian
civil war was the Petri dish in which the Islamic State consolidated its
forces, later emerging as the largest and most powerful terrorist
organization in human history. A Perfect Storm The point is that
[climate change]{.underline} and biodiversity loss [[could]{.mark} very
easily [push societies **to the brink of
collapse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This will exacerbate **existing
geopolitical tensions** and introduce entirely]{.underline} **[new power
struggles]{.underline}** between state and nonstate actors. At the same
time, advanced technologies will very likely become increasingly
powerful and accessible. As I've written elsewhere, the malicious agents
of the future will have bulldozers rather than shovels to dig mass
graves for their enemies. The result is a perfect storm of more
conflicts in the world along with unprecedentedly dangerous weapons. If
the conversation were to end here, we'd have ample reason for placing
climate change and biodiversity loss at the top of our priority lists.
But there are other reasons they ought to be considered urgent threats.
I would argue that they could make humanity more vulnerable to a
catastrophe involving superintelligence and even asteroids. The basic
reasoning is the same for both cases. Consider superintelligence first.
Programming a superintelligence whose values align with ours is a
formidable task even in stable circumstances. As Nick Bostrom argues in
his 2014 book, we should recognize the "default outcome" of
superintelligence to be "doom." Now imagine trying to solve these
problems amidst a rising tide of interstate wars, civil unrest,
terrorist attacks, and other tragedies? The societal stress caused by
climate change and biodiversity loss will almost certainly compromise
important conditions for creating friendly AI, such as sufficient
funding, academic programs to train new scientists, conferences on AI,
peer-reviewed journal publications, and communication/collaboration
between experts of different fields, such as computer science and
ethics. It could even make an "AI arms race" more likely, thereby
raising the probability of a malevolent superintelligence being created
either on purpose or by mistake. Similarly, [imagine]{.underline} that
astronomers discover [a]{.underline} behemoth asteroid [barreling
toward]{.underline} Earth. Will designing, building, and launching a
spacecraft to divert the assassin past our planet be easier or more
difficult in a world preoccupied with other survival issues? [In a
relatively peaceful world,]{.underline} [one could imagine an
asteroid]{.underline} actually [bringing humanity together]{.underline}
[by directing our attention **toward a common threat**.]{.underline}
**[But]{.underline}** if [the "[conflict multipliers]{.mark}" of climate
change]{.underline} and biodiversity loss [have already **catapulted
civilization**]{.underline} [into]{.underline} chaos [and]{.underline}
turmoil, I strongly suspect that [humanity will become]{.underline}
[more]{.underline}, rather than less, [susceptible to
danger]{.underline}s of this sort. Context Risks We can describe the
dual threats of climate change and biodiversity loss as "context risks."
Neither is likely to directly cause the extinction of our species. But
**[both [will define the context in which civilization confronts all the
other threats]{.mark}]{.underline}** before us. In this way, [they could
**indirectly** contribute to the **overall danger of
annihilation**]{.underline} --- and this worrisome effect could be
significant. For example, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, the effects of climate change will be "severe,"
"pervasive," and "irreversible." Or, as a 2016 study published in Nature
and authored by over twenty scientists puts it, the consequences of
climate change "will extend longer than the entire history of human
civilization thus far." Furthermore, a recent article in Science
Advances confirms that humanity has already escorted the biosphere into
the sixth mass extinction event in life's 3.8 billion year history on
Earth. Yet [another study suggests]{.underline} that [we could be
approaching a **sudden**,]{.underline} **[irreversible]{.underline}**,
catastrophic **[collapse of the global ecosystem]{.underline}**. If this
were to occur, it could result in "widespread social unrest, economic
instability and loss of human life." [Given the potential for
[environmental degradation]{.mark} to **[elevate the likelihood of
nuclear wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} **[nuclear
[terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, **[engineered
pandemics]{.underline}**,]{.mark} a **[superintelligence
takeover]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps even [**[an
impact winter]{.underline}**, [it ought to take precedence **over all
other risk concerns**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- at least in the
near-term. Let's make sure we get our priorities straight.

#### Warming [turns every impact]{.underline} and [causes extinction]{.underline}

**Cribb, 17**---Principal of JCA, Fellow of the Australian Academy of
Technological Sciences and Engineering, Former Director, National
Awareness, CSIRO (Julian, "The Baker," *Surviving the 21st Century*
Chapter 4, p. 91-94)

This event, known as [the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum]{.underline}
or [PETM]{.underline}, happened only about ten million years after the
dinosaurs were smashed by an asteroid impact. This 'hyperthermal' period
took place quite suddenly (in geological terms)---in less than 2000
years---and lasted for about 170,000 years before the planet again
cooled. The heat spike [was accompanied by]{.underline} a major wipe-out
of ocean life in particular, though most small land mammals survived.
Investigating the records of old marine sediments Zeebe was able to show
there had been [a sharp, 70 %, leap in atmospheric CO 2
concentrations]{.underline} at the time. However, he concluded there was
only sufficient carbon available to force the climate to warm by 1--3 °C
and that [some other mechanism]{.underline} must have been triggered by
the initial warming, which then [drove the Earth's temperature to fever
pitch]{.underline}, up by another 4--6 °C (Zeebe et al. 2009). This
process is the ' [[runaway]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}
' which [now [menaces us]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The significance of PETM is that it appears that about [the same volume
of carbon]{.underline} was dumped by natural processes into the Earth's
atmosphere and oceans [as humans are currently dumping with the burning
of fossil fuels and clearing of the world's forests]{.underline}---about
3 trillion tonnes in all---and it was this that [triggered the
hyperthermal surge in planetary heating.]{.underline}

[As to the [mechanism that could]{.mark} suddenly [release a huge amount
of extra carbon]{.mark} into the atmosphere and oceans and project
global temperatures up by 6--9 °C, [the most likely]{.mark} explanation
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} the one described at the start of this
chapter---[[the rapid melting]{.mark} and escape
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} billions of tonnes of [[frozen
methane]{.underline}]{.mark}, CH 4 , currently locked in tundra and
seabed sediments. This phenomenon, dubbed the "clathrate gun " (Kennett
et al. 2003), is now linked by scientists not only with the PETM event
but also, according to palaeontologist Peter Ward, with the Great Death
of the Permian, the worst annihilation in the history of life on Earth
(Ward 2008). The significance of the clathrates is that they consist of
methane, a gas that is 72 times more powerful than CO 2 as a climate
forcing agent in the short run, and 25 times stronger over a century or
so. The clathrates could be released by a process known as ' ocean
overturning ', a shift in global current patterns caused by [moderate
warming]{.underline}, which [brings warmer water from the surface down
into the depths, to melt the deposits of frozen gas. [Unlocking]{.mark}
several trillion tonnes of [methane]{.mark} would [cause]{.mark} global
[temperatures to rocket]{.mark} upwards sharply. Once such a process
gets under way, most experts consider, [warming will happen so fast it
is doubtful]{.mark} if [humans could do anything]{.mark} to stop it even
if they instantly ceased all burning of fossil fuels.]{.underline}

[[This]{.mark} 'double whammy' of global warming]{.underline} caused by
humans releasing three trillion tonnes of fossil carbon which then
precipitates an uncontrollable second phase driven by the melting of all
or part of the five trillion tonnes of natural methane deposits (Buff et
& Archer 2004) [[is the principal threat to]{.underline}]{.mark}
civilisation in the twenty-first century and, combined with nuclear
conflict (Chap. 4), to [the [survival]{.mark} of the human
species]{.underline}.

The IPCC's fifth report states that the melting of between 37 and 81 %
of the world's tundra permafrost is 'virtually certain' adding "[There
is a high risk of substantial carbon and methane emissions as a result
of permafrost thawing]{.underline} " ((IPCC 2014a), p. 74). This could
involve the venting of as much as 920 billion tonnes of carbon. However,
the Panel did not venture an estimate for methane emissions from the
melting of the far larger seabed clathrates and a number of scientists
have publicly criticised the world's leading climate body for remaining
so close-lipped about this mega-threat to human existence. The IPCC's
reticence is thought to be founded on a lack of adequate scientific data
to make a pronouncement with confidence---and partly to fear of the
mischief which the fossil fuels lobby would make of any premature
estimates. However, it critics argue, by the time we know for sure that
the Arctic and seabed methane is escaping in large volumes, it will be
too late to do anything about it.

The difficulty is that no-one knows how quickly the Earth will heat up,
as this depends on something that cannot be scientifically predicted:
the behaviour of the whole human species and the timeliness with which
we act. [Failure to abolish carbon emissions in time will make a 4--5 °C
rise in temperature likely]{.underline}. As to what that may mean, here
are some eminent opinions :

• Warming of 5 °C will mean the planet can support fewer than 1 billion
people---Hans-Joachim Shellnhuber, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact
Research (Kanter 2009)

• With temperature increases of 4--7 °C [[billions]{.mark} of people
[will have to move]{.mark} and [there will be]{.mark} very [severe
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}---Nicholas Stern, London School of
Economics (Kanter 2009)

• Food shortages, refugee crises, flooding of major cities and entire
island nations, mass extinction of plants and animals, and a climate so
drastically altered it may be dangerous for people to work or play
outside during the hottest times of the year---IPCC Fifth Assessment
(IPCC 2014b)

• Corn and soybean yields in the US may decrease by 63--82 %---Schlenker
and Roberts, Arizona State University (Schlenker & Roberts 2009a)

• [Up to [35% of]{.mark}]{.underline} the Earth's [[species will
be]{.mark} committed to [extinct]{.mark}ion]{.underline}---Chris Thomas,
University of Leeds (Thomas et al. 2004)

• Total polar melting combined with thermal expansion could involve [sea
levels]{.underline} eventually [rising]{.underline} by 65 m (180 ft),
i.e. to the 20th floor of tall buildings, [drowning most of the world's
coastal cities and displacing a third or more of the human
population]{.underline} (Winkelmann et al. 2015)

• [Intensified global [instability, hunger]{.mark}, [poverty and
conflict]{.mark}. Food and water [shortages]{.mark}, pandemic [disease,
disputes]{.mark} over refugees and resources, [and]{.mark} destruction
by [natural disasters]{.mark} in regions across the
globe]{.underline}---Chuck Hagel, US Secretary for Defence (Hagel 2014)

• "Almost inconceivable challenges as human society struggles to
adapt... billions of people forced to relocate.... [worsening tensions
especially over resources]{.underline}... [armed conflict is likely and
[nuclear war is possible]{.mark}"---]{.underline} Kurt Campbell, Center
for Strategic and International Studies (Campell et al. 2007).

• "[Unless we get control of (global warming), [it will mean]{.mark} our
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} eventually"---Helen Berry, Canberra
University (Snow & Hannam 2014).

#### Warming causes extinction

Robert A. **Schultz 16**, retired Professor and Chair of Computer
Information Systems at Woodbury University, 2016, "Modern Technology and
Human Extinction,"
<http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2016/InSITE16p131-145Schultz2307.pdf>

[[There is **consensus**]{.mark} that [there is a]{.mark}]{.underline}
relatively [[short window to reduce]{.mark} carbon [emissions before
drastic effects]{.mark} occur]{.underline}. [Recent [credible
projections]{.mark} of the result of lack of rapid drastic action [is an
average]{.mark}]{.underline} temperature increase of about
[[10]{.underline}]{.mark}o [[F by 2050]{.mark}. This]{.underline} change
[alone will be **[incredibly disruptive to all
life]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but will also cause great weather and
climate change. For comparison purposes, a 10 degree (Fahrenheit)
decrease was enough to cause an ice layer 4000 feet thick over Wisconsin
(Co2gether, 2012). Recently relevant information has surfaced about a
massive previous extinction. This is the Permian extinction, which
happened 252 million years ago, during which 95% of all species on
earth, both terrestrial and aquatic, vanished. The ocean temperature
after almost all life had disappeared was 15 degrees (Fahrenheit) above
current ocean temperatures.

Recent information about [the [Permian extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}
indicates it [[was caused by]{.mark} a [rapid increase in]{.mark} land
and ocean [temperatures]{.mark}]{.underline}, caused by the sudden
appearance of stupendous amounts of carbon in the form of greenhouse
gases (Kolbert, 2014, pp. 102-144). The origin of the carbon in these
enormous quantities is not yet known, but one possibility is the
[[sudden release of methane]{.mark} gases stored in
permafrost]{.underline}. This [[is]{.mark} also [a possibility]{.mark}
in our current situation. If so,]{.underline} **[[extinction would be a
natural]{.mark} side [effect]{.mark} of human processes]{.underline}**.
There is also a real but smaller possibility of what is called "runaway
greenhouse," in which the earth's temperature becomes like Venus'
surface temperature of 800o

[The [threat of extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} here [[is not]{.mark}
entirely [sudden.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[The threat is]{.mark}, if
anything, [worse]{.mark}**. Changes in the
atmosphere]{.underline}\--mainly increases in the concentration of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere\-- [can **start processes that can't
be reversed** but which take long periods of time to
manifest]{.underline}. "Runaway greenhouse" may be the worst. Once
again, suggestions of technological solutions to this situation should
be treated with some skepticism. These proposals are often made by
technophiles ignoring all the evidence that technology is very much
subject to unanticipated side effects and unanticipated failures. What
has happened concerning the depletion of the ozone layer should be a
clear warning against the facile uses of technology through
geoengineering to alter the makeup of the entire planet and its
atmosphere.

[The complicating factor in assessing extinction likelihood from climate
change is]{.underline} corporations, especially American **[fossil fuel
corporations]{.underline}** such as Exxon-Mobil and Shell. Through their
contributions, [they have been able to delay legislation
ameliorating]{.underline} global warming and [climate
change]{.underline}. As mentioned before, recently released papers from
Exxon-Mobil show that the corporation did accept the scientific findings
about global warming and climate change. But they concluded that
maintaining their profits was more important than acting to ameliorate
climate change.

[Since it is not a matter of getting corporations to appreciate
scientific facts, the **[chances of extinction from climate change are
good]{.mark}**. To ameliorate climate change, it is important to
leave]{.underline} a high percentage of [fossil fuel reserves in the
ground]{.underline}. But this is exactly what a profit-seeking fossil
fuel corporation cannot do. One can still hope that because fossil fuel
corporations are made up of individuals, increasingly bad consequences
of global warming and climate change will change their minds about
profits. But because of the lag in effects, this mind change will
probably be too late. So I conclude [we will probably see something like
the effects of the Permian extinction]{.underline} perhaps some time
**[around 2050]{.underline}**. (The Permian extinction was 95%
extinction of all species.) This assumes the release of methane from the
arctic will take place around then.

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy\-\--A2: No Impact\-\--Adaption

#### No adaption -- high cost, varied impacts means monolithic solutions fail, scientific uncertainty

**Reilly 14** \-\-\-- John, Co-Director of the Joint Program on the
Science and Policy of Global Change at the Center for Energy and
Environmental Policy Research, Senior Lecturer at the Sloan School of
Management (MIT), BS in economics and political science
(Wisconsin-Madison), MS and a PhD in economics (Penn), "Why We Can't
Just Adapt to Climate Change," MIT Technology Review, 4/3,
<http://www.technologyreview.com/view/526116/why-we-cant-just-adapt-to-climate-change/>

What [the report does provide]{.underline} is [some documentation of
adaptation in action]{.underline}---what different regions, cities,
sectors, and groups are doing to adapt---concluding that there is a
growing body of experience from which to learn.
**[However]{.underline}**, perhaps [the greatest truth in the report is
in the following statement]{.underline}: "[[Adaptation is]{.mark} place
and [context specific]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[with no single
approach]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for reducing risks
appropriate]{.underline} across all settings (high confidence).
[Effective risk reduction and [adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}
strategies [[consider]{.mark} the dynamics of
[vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline} and exposure [and their linkages
with [socioeconomic processes]{.mark}, sustainable [development, and
climate change]{.mark}."]{.underline} Hence, [while it's possible to
learn from others']{.underline} adaptation experiences, [in the end, the
[specifics]{.mark} of climate change in my place, given my
circumstances, and the socio-economic environment in which I live will
[present]{.mark} me with **[very different]{.mark} climate
outcomes**]{.underline} [and [opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline} to
adapt than you will have where you live. [[This]{.mark} fact alone
**[raises the cost]{.mark}** of adaptation, because]{.underline} to some
degree [[each recipe needs to be]{.mark} invented
**a[new]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [What worked in the past]{.underline}
likely [won't work in the future]{.underline}---or at least, not as
well. [And [we need to]{.mark} [process]{.mark} a lot of **[highly
uncertain]{.mark}**]{.underline} climate [[projections]{.mark} in
developing the new recipe.]{.underline}

#### Escalating levels of warming make adaptation possible -- causes extinction 

Naomi **Klein 14**, award-winning journalist, syndicated columnist,
former Miliband Fellow at the London School of Economics, member of the
board of directors of 350.org, *This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs.
the Climate*, pp. 12-14

In a 2012 report, the World Bank laid out the gamble implied by that
target. "[[As]{.mark} global [warming approaches]{.mark} and exceeds
[2-degrees]{.mark} Celsius, [there is a]{.mark} [risk of]{.mark}
triggering **[nonlinear tipping elements]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Examples include]{.underline} the disintegration of the West Antarctic
ice sheet leading to more rapid sea-level rise, or [large-scale Amazon
dieback drastically affecting ecosystems, rivers, agriculture, energy
production, and livelihoods]{.underline}. This would further add to
21^st^-century global warming and impact entire continents." In other
words, once we allow temperatures to climb past a certain point, where
the mercury stops is not in our control.¶ But the bigger problem---and
the reason Copenhagen caused such great despair---is that because
governments did not agree to binding targets, they are free to pretty
much ignore their commitments. Which is precisely what is happening.
Indeed, emissions are rising so rapidly that unless something radical
changes within our economic structure, 2 degrees now looks like a
utopian dream. And it's not just environmentalists who are raising the
alarm. The World Bank also warned when it released its report that
"[[we're on track to a 4-C]{.mark} warmer [world]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[by century's end\] [[marked by]{.mark} **extreme [heat
waves]{.mark}**, **[declining]{.mark} global [food]{.mark} stocks**,
**[loss of ecosystems]{.mark}** and biodiversity, [and]{.mark}
**life-threatening [sea level rise]{.mark}**]{.underline}." And the
report cautioned that, "[[there is]{.mark} also **[no certainty
that]{.mark} [adaptation]{.mark} to a 4-C world [is
possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Kevin Anderson, former director (now
deputy director) of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change, which has
quickly established itself as one of the U.K's premier climate research
institutions, is even blunter; he says [4 degrees Celsius
warming]{.underline}---7.2 degrees Fahrenheit---[is "incompatible with
an organized, equitable, and civilized global community]{.underline}."¶
We don't know exactly what a 4 degree Celsius world would look like, but
even the best-case scenario is likely to be calamitous. [Four degrees of
warming could raise global sea levels by 1 or possibly even 2 meters by
2100]{.underline} (and would lock in at least a few additional meters
over future centuries). This would drown some island nations such as the
Maldives and Tuvalu, and inundate many coastal areas from Ecuador and
Brazil to the Netherlands to much of California and the northeastern
United States as well as huge swaths of South and Southeast Asia. Major
cities likely in jeopardy include Boston, New York, greater Los Angeles,
Vancouver, London, Mumbai, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.¶ Meanwhile, [brutal
heat waves that can kill tens of thousands of people]{.underline}, even
in wealthy countries, [would become entirely unremarkable summer events
on every continent but Antarctica]{.underline}. [The [heat would]{.mark}
also [cause staple crops to suffer **dramatic**]{.mark} **yield
[losses]{.mark}** across the globe]{.underline} (it is possible that
Indian wheat and U.S. could plummet by as much as 60 percent), this at a
time [[when demand will be surging]{.mark} due to population growth and
a growing demand for meat]{.underline}. And since crops will be facing
not just heat stress but also extreme events such as wide-ranging
droughts, flooding, or pest outbreaks, the [losses could easily turn out
to be more severe than the models have predicted]{.underline}. [When you
[add]{.mark} ruinous [hurricanes]{.mark}, raging [wildfires, fisheries
collapse]{.mark}s, widespread [disruptions to water]{.mark} supplies,
[extinctions, and]{.mark} globe-trotting [diseases]{.mark} to the mix,
it indeed becomes difficult to imagine that a peaceful, ordered society
could be sustained]{.underline} (that is, where such a thing exists in
the first place).¶ And keep in mind that these are the optimistic
scenarios in which warming is more or less stabilized at 4 degrees
Celsius and does not trigger tipping points beyond which runaway warming
would occur. Based on the latest modeling, it is becoming safer to
assume that [4 degrees could bring about a number of extremely dangerous
feedback loops]{.underline}---an Arctic that is regularly ice-free in
September, for instance, or, according to one recent study, [global
vegetation that is too saturated to act as a reliable
"sink]{.underline}", leading to more carbon being emitted rather than
stored. Once this happens, any hope of predicting impacts pretty much
goes out the window. And this process may be starting sooner than anyone
predicted. In May 2014, NASA and the University of California, Irvine
scientists revealed that glacier melt in a section of West Antarctica
roughly the size of France now "appears unstoppable." This likely spells
down for the entire West Antarctic ice sheet, which according to lead
study author Eric Rignot "comes with a sea level rise between three and
five metres. Such an event will displace millions of people worldwide."
The disintegration, however, could unfold over centuries and there is
still time for emission reductions to slow down the process and prevent
the worst. ¶ Much more frightening than any of this is the fact that
[plenty of mainstream [analysts think that]{.mark}]{.underline} on our
current emissions trajectory, [[we are headed for]{.mark} **even [more
than 4 degrees]{.mark}** of warming]{.underline}. In 2011, the usually
staid International Energy Agency (IEA) issued a report predicting that
[we are actually on track for [6 degrees]{.mark}
Celsius]{.underline}---10.8 degrees Fahrenheit---of warming. And as the
IEA's chief economist put it: "Everybody, even the school children,
knows that [this [will have catastrophic implications]{.mark} for all of
us]{.underline}." (The evidence indicates that [6 degrees of warming is
likely to set in motion several major tipping points]{.underline}---not
only slower ones such as the aforementioned breakdown of the West
Antarctic ice sheet, but possibly more abrupt ones,
[[like]{.underline}]{.mark} [massive [releases of methane from]{.mark}
Arctic [permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}.) The accounting giant
PricewaterhouseCoopers as also published a report warning businesses
that we are headed for "4-C , or even 6-C" of warming.¶ These various
projections are the equivalent of every alarm in your house going off
simultaneously. And then every alarm on your street going off as well,
one by one by one. They mean, quite simply, that [[climate change has
become an **existential crisis**]{.mark} **for the human
species**]{.underline}. The only historical precedent for a crisis of
this depth and scale was the Cold War fear that we were headed toward
nuclear holocaust, which would have made much of the planet
uninhabitable. But that was (and remains) a threat; a slim possibility,
should geopolitics spiral out of control. The vast majority of nuclear
scientists never told us that we were almost certainly going to put our
civilization in peril if we kept going about our daily lives as usual,
doing exactly what we were already going, which is what climate
scientists have been telling us for years. ¶ As the Ohio State
University climatologist Lonnie G. Thompson, a world-renowned specialist
on glacier melt, explained in 2010,
"[[Climatologists]{.underline}]{.mark}, like other scientists, [tend to
be a stolid group. We [are not given to theatrical
rantings]{.mark}]{.underline} about falling skies. Most of us are far
more comfortable in our laboratories or gathering data in the field than
we are giving interviews to journalists or speaking before Congressional
committees. When then are climatologists speaking out about the dangers
of global warming? The answer is that virtually [**[all of
us]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}]{.mark} [now [convinced that]{.mark}
global [warming poses a]{.mark} **clear and present [danger to
civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy\-\--A2: No Impact\-\--Negative Feedbacks

#### It\'s positive feedbacks -- 

#### [Water vapor]{.underline} and [albedo]{.underline} -- prefer their certainty 

**Booth 13** \-\-\-- Ben, Senior Climate Scientist at Met Office Hadley
Centre, "Climate Feedbacks," Met Office, 9/27,
<http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-change/guide/science/explained/feedbacks>

[**What are the climate feedbacks you fully understand?** There are
[some]{.mark}]{.underline} types of [[feedback]{.underline}]{.mark}
which [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[fairly [well
understood]{.mark}]{.underline}** by climate scientists [[and]{.mark}
their [effects are **routinely** included]{.mark}]{.underline} in
climate models (which allow us to make projections for our future
climate). This means [we have taken into account the impact they may
have as our climate warms in the future. Water vapour]{.underline}
(positive feedback) [[As air gets warm]{.mark}er, [it]{.mark}s capacity
to [hold moisture]{.mark} increases]{.underline}. Our atmosphere is
getting warmer because of climate change and, as a result, is holding
more [water [vapour]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [[is a **potent**
greenhouse gas]{.underline}]{.mark} --- when in the atmosphere, [water
vapour helps the Earth hold on to more energy from the sun]{.underline}.
So a [warming climate means]{.underline} more water [vapour, which in
turn warms the climate]{.underline} further --- **[[a classic positive
feedback]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Albedo (positive feedback) [[Albedo
is]{.mark} the amount of light]{.underline} [reflected]{.underline} by a
surface, [**which is [very important]{.mark}** in climate
science]{.underline}. A surface with a high albedo, such as snow or
sand, will reflect more sunlight back out to space. The lower the
albedo, the more energy and heat is absorbed. Global [[warming
is]{.mark} causing ice and snow to melt, [revealing]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[land]{.underline}]{.mark} or ocean underneath. [[Ice]{.mark} and

[Methane [hydrates]{.mark}]{.underline} (positive feedback) These
[are]{.underline} potentially [**a very big deal which [could change our
whole understanding]{.mark}** of climate change]{.underline}, but it\'s
very uncertain. [There are]{.underline} very [large stores]{.underline}
of methane [locked away]{.underline} at depth in the ocean. We know the
[stability]{.underline} of these stores [is dependent on temperature.
[As]{.mark} the [oceans]{.mark} get [warm]{.mark}er]{.underline} it\'s
possible this [balance could be upset and the [stores
release]{.mark}d]{.underline} --- **[which would be very
serious]{.underline}**. [[Methane is]{.underline}]{.mark} more than
[**[20 times]{.underline}** [as potent as CO2]{.underline}]{.mark} as a
greenhouse gas. [[There\'s]{.mark}]{.underline} some
[[evidence]{.underline}]{.mark} to suggest that going back **[over a
very long historical period]{.underline}** (more than millions of
years), the [[release]{.underline}]{.mark} of these methane stores [may
[have]{.mark} **played [a big role]{.mark}** [in abrupt]{.mark} and
severe [changes]{.mark}]{.underline} to past climate. How close we are
to any possible threshold is very much an open question.
[[Permafrost]{.mark} methane]{.underline} (positive feedback) This
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a big question mark but also potentially
**[[a]{.mark} very [big deal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[There are]{.mark}
very organic rich soils]{.underline} in certain parts of the world. At
higher latitudes, these are [frozen over by permafrost, and those
greenhouse [gases]{.mark} are effectively [locked away. When]{.mark} the
[soil thaws]{.mark}]{.underline} due to rising temperatures, these
[[gases]{.mark} could [become]{.mark} unlocked and be [released]{.mark}
as CO2 or methane]{.underline}. At the moment we don\'t know how much of
the CO2 is stored away or to what extent it would be released when the
soil thaws.

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy\-\--A2: No Impact\-\--Negative Feedbacks\-\--Carbon

#### 1) Carbon cycle will become positive with warming 2) reject their evidence -- the science is uncertain

Centre, "Climate Feedbacks," Met Office, 9/27,
<http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-change/guide/science/explained/feedbacks>

There are feedbacks which we understand and are starting to be included
in models, but [there is still]{.underline} some
**[[uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}** about them. This [doubt [relates
to]{.mark} the]{.underline} exact [way the feedbacks work,]{.underline}
the [[magnitude]{.mark} of the feedbacks]{.underline} [[and how
they]{.underline}]{.mark} might [[respond]{.mark} to]{.underline} our
[changing climate]{.underline}. We are doing a lot of research to
understand more about these processes and the models are being updated
accordingly. [Land [carbon cycle]{.mark}]{.underline} (currently
negative feedback) For every tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into
the atmosphere, within a year about half of that will be absorbed by the
ocean and land, e.g. through trees and plants. This important process
[helps mask]{.underline} the true extent of our CO2 [emissions **but**
it [could be affected by]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark}. Any changes
**could have a huge impact** on the future of our climate]{.underline}
if we continue to emit large quantities of CO2. Global [warming could
affect the process in two ways]{.underline}: Oceans [[As]{.mark} the
[ocean]{.mark} [absorbs]{.mark} CO2 [it becomes]{.mark}]{.underline}
more [[acidic, **reducing**]{.mark} [the amount]{.mark}]{.underline} of
[CO2 [it can]{.mark}]{.underline} further [[absorb]{.underline}]{.mark}.
As the [[temperature]{.underline}]{.mark} of the ocean
[[increases]{.mark}]{.underline} this [[reduce]{.underline}]{.mark}s its
[[capacity]{.mark} to absorb CO2]{.underline}. Land --- [[climate change
can affect]{.underline}]{.mark} the [land in a variety of ways,
including]{.underline}: Negative climate feedback as temperatures
increase because the areas in which trees can grow will extend north to
higher latitudes. New trees will absorb CO2, taking it out of the
atmosphere. [Positive [feedbacks]{.mark} [around]{.mark} the [tropical
zones]{.mark}]{.underline}. As temperatures increase, [soils,
[plants]{.mark} and trees]{.underline} in these areas will
[[become]{.underline}]{.mark} more [heat [stressed]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- potentially [[releasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[huge]{.mark}
amounts of [carbon]{.mark}]{.underline}** [they store [and]{.mark} even
[threatening]{.mark} the future of [important areas]{.mark} such
as]{.underline} [the Amazon]{.underline} rainforest. Overall,
[[these]{.mark} [changes]{.mark} could]{.underline} [**dramatically
reduce** the overall negative feedback]{.underline} of the carbon cycle,
potentially [**[withdraw]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} current
[benefit]{.mark}** it offers us]{.underline}. These processes have been
inputted into climate models over the past decade. [As we understand
more]{.underline} about how they work, [their importance is coming to
the forefront]{.underline} of how we look at climate change.

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy\-\--A2: No Impact\-\--Negative Feedbacks\-\--Clouds

#### Clouds are net positive -- newest research proving our interpretation

Clouds (positive and negative feedback) [The way
[climate]{.mark}]{.underline} change [affects clouds [could
bring]{.mark} about [a **positive or negative
feedback**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The big scientific question, which we
have been researching for more than a decade, is how do clouds respond
to a change in CO2? [[There is]{.mark} now **some [consensus]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} [reduced stratocumulus]{.mark} clouds [in]{.mark} a
[warming]{.mark} climate --- **leading to [a]{.mark} net [positive
feedback]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [We are also looking at]{.underline}
the effect on [[high]{.mark} [clouds]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} such
as cirrus. These have a small overall warming effect on climate. [They
reflect sunlight]{.underline} in the same way as stratocumulus, [but
they [have a]{.mark} more [powerful effect as a blanket]{.mark} ---
helping retain heat]{.underline} radiating away from the Earth\'s
surface. As such, [[increases]{.mark} in cirrus will [warm]{.mark} the
climate]{.underline}, while decreases will cool it --- the opposite of
stratocumulus. [There is a lot of [research]{.mark} going into this
area]{.underline} and [advances]{.underline} in understanding [[will
enable]{.mark} us to **improve**]{.underline} our
[[confidence]{.underline}]{.mark} in climate projections.

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy\-\--A2: No Warming

#### Yes warming -- it's real, anthropogenic and getting worse -- Our evidence assumes weather events, has best measuring metrics, answers 1998 slowdown

**Plumer 15** \-\-\-- Brad, Senior Editor of Vox's science, energy, and
environmental coverage, "It\'s Official: 2014 was the Hottest Year Ever
Recorded," Vox, 1/16,
<http://www.vox.com/2015/1/16/7556423/2014-hottest-year>

[Global warming is **still with us**]{.underline}: [[2014 was Earth\'s
**hottest**]{.mark} **year since records began**]{.underline} in 1880,
[according to two separate analyses]{.underline} from NASA and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: The global [average
temperature]{.underline} in 2014 [was]{.underline} roughly
[1.24°F]{.underline} (or 0.69°C) [warmer than the average]{.underline}
during the twentieth century, NOAA said. [That included record heat in
the western]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[St]{.underline}**ates, [Europe, Australia,]{.underline} parts of
Siberia, [and]{.underline} much of [the Pacific]{.underline} Ocean. [The
previous]{.underline} hottest year on record [had been 2010, followed by
2005 and 1998]{.underline}. (Technically, 2010 and 2014 were very close,
and within the margin of error, though both agencies said it was more
likely 2014 was hotter overall.) [What\'s striking]{.underline}, though,
[is that 2014 broke the record]{.underline} **[[without]{.mark} the
benefit of an [El Niño]{.mark},]{.underline}** a cyclical phenomenon in
the Pacific Ocean [that can]{.underline} periodically [bump
up]{.underline} global [temperatures]{.underline} a bit --- as happened
in 1998 and 2010. All [these new records are no
coincidence.]{.underline} Climate [[scientists expect]{.mark} the [Earth
to get hotter]{.mark}]{.underline} over time **[so [long as
humans]{.mark} keep [add]{.mark}ing greenhouse
[gases]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the atmosphere. [There will be
short-term variations]{.underline} from year to year --- El Niño years
are a bit hotter, La Niña years are a bit cooler --- so not every year
will set records. **[But [the overall trend is
up]{.mark}]{.underline}**: In all, global [average temperatures have now
risen]{.underline} [1.4°F]{.underline} (0.8°C) since the 19th century.
And [[scientists]{.mark} have [warned]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[temperatures]{.mark} [could rise]{.mark}]{.underline} even more
drastically --- **[another 5°F]{.underline}** **[[(3°C]{.mark}) or
more]{.underline}** --- this century [if greenhouse-gas emissions keep
rising]{.underline}. [That]{.underline} much heat [could have **sweeping
impacts**]{.underline} [on global sea levels, ice cover, droughts, and
agriculture. [NASA and NOAA]{.mark}]{.underline} each [[conducted
separate analyses]{.underline}]{.mark} of global temperatures [[using
satellites]{.underline}]{.mark}, a network of [[ground thermometers,
radar, buoys, and other tools]{.underline}]{.mark}. But they [both came
to similar conclusions]{.underline}. Both agencies said that [the
[10]{.mark} [hottest]{.mark} years [have]{.mark} all [come since 1998, a
sign]{.mark} the [Earth was getting]{.mark} **steadily
[warmer]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \"[If you are younger than
29]{.underline} years old, **[you haven\'t lived in a month that was
cooler than the 20th-century average,]{.underline}**\" noted Marshall
Shepherd, a meteorologist at the University of Georgia. It\'s worth
clarifying that [2014 wasn\'t the hottest year in the planet\'s entire
4.5 billion year history]{.underline}. The Earth has been hotter in the
distant past, before human civilization arose --- a result of natural
processes and orbital shifts. **[But]{.underline}** [[Earth\'s
climate]{.mark} had **roughly [stabilized]{.mark}**]{.underline} over
the last 10,000 years, **[[until humans began]{.mark} burning fossil
fuels and [emitting]{.mark} greenhouse gases.]{.underline}** [Scientists
say [the rise]{.mark} in temperatures]{.underline} in the 20th century
**[[is a sign of man-made warming]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Record heat in
2014 blanketed the western United States, exacerbating a brutal ongoing
drought in California. The Pacific Northwest and Alaska also experienced
record warmth. [For the first time in 100 years]{.underline} of records,
the temperature in [Anchorage]{.underline}, Alaska, [never fell below
0]{.underline}°F. By contrast, the Midwest and Northeastern United
States were actually a bit cooler than usual in 2014. One reason for
this was jet stream patterns that pushed warm tropical air up into
Alaska and nudged colder Arctic air down into the continental United
States. Global warming isn\'t necessarily uniform across the entire
planet. [The year also saw extremely warm temperatures in Europe ---
with 19]{.underline} countries likely [experiencing their hottest year
ever]{.underline} --- as well as record heat over much of the Pacific
Ocean, fueling a number of strong storms in the region. Both agencies
said that [[temperatures over]{.mark} the [oceans **were the warmest
ever**]{.mark} **recorded**.]{.underline} An **[[El Niño could push
temperatures to new highs]{.underline}]{.mark}** [It\'s
significant]{.underline} that [2014 was a record]{.underline} hot year
[even without an El Niño. El Niño events]{.underline}, which occur in
the Pacific, tend to [transfer heat]{.underline} stored beneath the
ocean\'s surface up into the atmosphere. Years that come right on the
tail of a major El Niño tend to be hotter than average --- indeed, that
was a big reason why 1998 was so unusually hot. Forecasters say there\'s
still some chance that a (weak) El Niño could reappear in the Pacific
Ocean this year --- which could in theory push temperatures up in 2015
to new highs. At a press conference, NASA\'s Gavin Schmidt explained
that temperatures typically spike about three months after an El Niño
event. Still, that\'s not assured. [Is this the end of the global
warming \"slowdown\"]{.underline}? If 2014 really is the warmest year on
record, then **[[it\'s definitely]{.mark} [wrong]{.mark} to say [that
global \"stopped]{.mark}\" back [in 1998]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- [a
favorite line of climate skeptics]{.underline} like Sen. James Inhofe
(R-OK). But then again, [the idea]{.underline} that global
[warming]{.underline} had \"[stopped\" was never very
compelling]{.underline} to begin with --- [and not just because [1998
was]{.mark} a **[cherry-picked]{.mark}** year]{.underline}.
[Scientists]{.underline} have [assembled]{.underline} plenty of
[evidence]{.underline} that [adding more]{.underline} greenhouse
[gases]{.underline} like carbon dioxide to the atmosphere [will heat up
the Earth]{.underline} over time. [Short-term
[blips]{.mark}]{.underline} in the temperature record **[[don\'t
affect]{.mark} this broad [understanding]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [It\'s
the long-term trends that count.]{.underline} What has puzzled some
scientists, however, is the fact that global average surface
temperatures appear to have risen at a slightly slower rate over the
past 16 years than they did in the 20 years before that --- despite the
fact that greenhouse gases are piling up in the atmosphere at a record
pace. This is what\'s often referred to as the \"slowdown.\" Both [NOAA
and NASA found that there does appear to be a recent slowdown, albeit a
**very small one**]{.underline}: Why is that? You can see a longer
rundown of possible explanations for the slowdown in the 2000s here ---
hypotheses include the idea that some of the extra heat trapped by
greenhouse gases has been stored temporarily in the ocean, or that
there\'s been an outburst of volcanic activity that muted the pace of
warming in the 2000s. These details are certainly relevant: For
instance, if extra heat did go into the ocean because of, say, strong
trade winds in the Pacific, that might set the stage for more rapid
warming in the years ahead. [**But** the big picture is the same as it
ever was]{.underline} --- regardless of year-to-year blips. [As we put
more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the Earth will get hotter.
There will be short-term fluctuations]{.underline} here and there. Some
years will be record hot years. Others won\'t. El Niño years will be a
bit hotter. La Niña years will be a bit cooler. [But over a long enough
time horizon, **global [warming is still with us]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Four different agencies track global temperatures A side note: [NASA and
NOAA are only two of four major]{.underline} government
[agencies]{.underline} worldwide [keeping track]{.underline} of global
temperature trends, using a mix of satellites, ground-based
thermometers, buoys, radar, and other tools. In January, the Japan
Meteorological Agency ([[JMA) released its own]{.underline}]{.mark}
preliminary [[analysis]{.mark} saying that 2014 was the hottest
year]{.underline} on record. The Met Office Hadley Centre in the United
Kingdom has yet to report. [All [four]{.mark}]{.underline} tend to
[[agree]{.mark} that the Earth is warming, though they work with
different datasets]{.underline} and come up with slightly different
numbers. [[NASA has the **most comprehensive coverage**]{.mark}, with
its data covering]{.underline} [99 percent of the globe]{.underline}.
There is also a separate satellite-only record, maintained at the
University of Alabama-Huntsville, that shows 1998 remains the hottest
year, well above 2014 (which is only the ninth-hottest year in this
dataset). But scientists say that satellites alone give an incomplete
picture and other ground-based measurements are needed for a full
analysis. \"[You will hear]{.underline} some [skeptics say]{.underline}
that the [satellite-based temperature records don\'t support these
findings, but we also used ground-based instruments]{.underline} like
thermometers and rain gauges [to validate these
measurements]{.underline},\" said Shepherd.

<http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2015/02/25/co2-greenhouse-effect-increase/>

[[Scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[observed]{.mark} an increase in
[carbon dioxide's greenhouse effect]{.mark}]{.underline} at the Earth's
surface **[[for the first time]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The researchers,
led by scientists from the US Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab), measured atmospheric carbon
dioxide's increasing capacity to absorb thermal radiation emitted from
the Earth's surface over an eleven-year period at two locations in North
America. [They [attributed]{.mark} this **upward trend** [to]{.mark}
rising CO2 levels **from fossil fuel [emissions]{.mark}.** The
[influence of]{.mark}]{.underline} atmospheric [[CO2
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the balance between incoming energy from the Sun
and outgoing [[heat]{.underline}]{.mark} from the Earth (also called the
planet's energy balance) **[[is]{.mark} well
[established]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [But this effect has not been
experimentally confirmed outside the laboratory **until
now**.]{.underline} The research is reported Wednesday, Feb. 25, in the
advance online publication of the journal Nature. The [[results agree
with theoretical]{.mark} [predictions]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.mark}
the greenhouse [effect **due to human activity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [[research]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[provides]{.mark} **further
[confirmation]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [the calculations used in
today's climate [models are **on track**]{.mark}]{.underline} [when it
comes to representing the impact of CO2]{.underline}. The scientists
measured atmospheric carbon dioxide's contribution to radiative forcing
at two sites, one in Oklahoma and one on the North Slope of Alaska, from
2000 to the end of 2010. Radiative forcing is a measure of how much the
planet's energy balance is perturbed by atmospheric changes. Positive
radiative forcing occurs when the Earth absorbs more energy from solar
radiation than it emits as thermal radiation back to space. It can be
measured at the Earth's surface or high in the atmosphere. In this
research, [the scientists focused on the surface.]{.underline} [They
found that [CO2 was responsible for a **significant uptick** in
radiative forcing]{.mark}]{.underline} at both locations, about
two-tenths of a Watt per square meter per decade. [They linked this
trend to the 22 parts-per-million increase in atmospheric
CO2]{.underline} between 2000 and 2010. Much of this CO2 is [from the
burning of fossil fuels, according to a modeling system that tracks CO2
sources **[around the world]{.mark}.**]{.underline} "[[We see,]{.mark}
**for the first time in the field**]{.underline}, [the
[amplification]{.mark} of the greenhouse effect]{.underline} [[because
there's more CO2]{.mark} in the atmosphere [to absorb]{.mark} what the
Earth emits in response to incoming [solar radiation]{.mark},"
says]{.underline} Daniel [Feldman]{.underline}, a scientist in Berkeley
Lab's Earth Sciences Division and lead author of the Nature paper.
"[Numerous studies show rising atmospheric CO2]{.underline}
concentrations, [but [our study provides]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[the
critical link]{.underline}** [between]{.underline}]{.mark} [those
[concentrations]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the addition of [energy]{.mark} to
the system]{.underline}, **[or the greenhouse effect]{.underline}**,"
Feldman adds. He conducted the research with fellow Berkeley Lab
scientists Bill Collins and Margaret Torn, as well as Jonathan Gero of
the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Timothy Shippert of Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory, and Eli Mlawer of Atmospheric and
Environmental Research. [The [scientists used **incredibly
precise**]{.mark} spectroscopic [instruments]{.mark}]{.underline}
operated by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research
Facility, a DOE Office of Science User Facility. These instruments,
located at ARM research sites in Oklahoma and Alaska, measure thermal
infrared energy that travels down through the atmosphere to the surface.
[**[They]{.mark} can [detect]{.mark} the [unique]{.mark} spectral
[signature of]{.mark} infrared [energy from CO2.
]{.mark}**[Other]{.mark} instruments]{.underline} at the two locations
[[detect]{.mark} the unique signatures of phenomena that can also emit
infrared energy, such as [clouds and water vapor.]{.mark} The
[combination]{.mark} of these measurements [enabled]{.mark} the
[scientists to isolate]{.mark} the [signals]{.mark} attributed **[solely
to]{.mark} [CO2]{.mark}.**]{.underline} "[We measured radiation in the
form of infrared energy. Then we controlled for other
factors]{.underline} that would impact our measurements, [such
as]{.underline} a [weather]{.underline} system moving through the area,"
says Feldman. [[The result is]{.mark} two time-series [from two very
different locations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Each series spans from 2000 to
the end of 2010, and includes 3300 measurements from Alaska and 8300
measurements from Oklahoma obtained on a near-daily basis.
[[Both]{.mark} series [showed the **same trend**]{.mark}**:**
atmospheric CO2 emitted an increasing amount of infrared
energy,]{.underline} to the tune of 0.2 Watts per square meter per
decade. This increase is about ten percent of the trend from all sources
of infrared energy such as clouds and water vapor.

#### It's anthropogenic -- just stop -- specifically answers solar radiance and volcanoes 

**Plumer 14** \-\-\-- Brad, Senior Editor of Vox's science, energy, and
environmental coverage, "Everything You Need to Know about Global
Warming: How do We Know Humans are Responsible for Global Warming?" Vox,
10/22,
<http://www.vox.com/cards/global-warming/how-do-we-know-humans-are-responsible-for-global-warming#E7320464>

How do we know humans are responsible for global warming? [Climate
[scientists]{.mark}]{.underline} say they **[[are 95 percent
certain]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[human influence]{.mark} has been
the dominant [cause]{.mark} of global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}
since 1950. [**They\'re about as sure of this as they are that cigarette
smoke causes cancer.** Why are they so confident]{.underline}? In part
because they have a good grasp on how greenhouse gases can warm the
planet, in part because [[the theory fits]{.underline}]{.mark} the
available evidence, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} in part because
[[alternate theories]{.mark} [have been ruled out.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Let\'s break it down in six steps: 1) [Scientists have long
known]{.underline} that [greenhouse [gases]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
atmosphere --- such as carbon dioxide, methane, or water vapor ---
[absorb certain frequencies]{.underline} of infrared radiation [and
scatter them back]{.underline} toward the Earth. [These]{.underline}
gases essentially [[prevent heat from escaping]{.mark} too quickly back
into space, trapping that radiation at the surface and keeping the
planet warm.]{.underline} 2) Climate [[scientists]{.underline} [also
know]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[concentrations]{.mark} of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere [have grown **significantly**]{.mark} since the
Industrial Revolution]{.underline}. [[Carbon]{.mark} dioxide has risen
[40 percent. Methane]{.mark} has risen [150]{.mark} percent.
[Through]{.mark}]{.underline} some relatively [straightforward
[chemistry, scientists]{.mark} can [trace]{.mark}]{.underline} these
[[increases to human activities]{.underline}]{.mark} like burning oil,
gas, and coal. 3) So [it stands to reason]{.underline} that [more
greenhouse gases would lead to more heat. And, indeed,
[satellite]{.mark} [measurements]{.mark} have
[show]{.mark}n]{.underline} that [[less]{.mark} infrared
[radiation]{.mark} is [escaping]{.mark}]{.underline} out into space over
time and instead returning to the Earth\'s surface. [[That\'s **strong
evidence**]{.mark} that the greenhouse effect is
increasing]{.underline}. 4) [[There are]{.mark} **other [human
fingerprints]{.mark}** that suggest that increased greenhouse gases are
warming the planet]{.underline}. For instance, back [in the 1960s,
simple climate models predicted]{.underline} that global [warming caused
by more carbon dioxide would lead to cooling in the upper
atmosphere]{.underline} (because the heat is getting trapped at the
surface). Later [[satellite measurements]{.mark} [confirmed]{.mark}
exactly that]{.underline}. Here are a few other similar predictions that
have also been confirmed. 5) [Meanwhile, climate scientists]{.underline}
have [ruled out other explanations]{.underline} for the rise in average
temperatures over the last century. [To take one example: [solar
activity can shift]{.mark}]{.underline} from year to year, affecting the
Earth\'s climate. **[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** [satellite [data
shows]{.mark} that total solar [irradiance]{.mark} has [declined]{.mark}
slightly]{.underline} in the past 35 years, **[[even as the Earth has
warmed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 6) More [recent calculations have shown
that [**it\'s impossible** to explain]{.mark} the [temperature]{.mark}
rise we\'ve seen in the past century [without]{.mark} taking the
increase in carbon-dioxide and other greenhouse [gases]{.mark} into
account. Natural causes, like the [sun or volcanoes]{.mark}, have an
influence, but **they\'re [not sufficient]{.mark} by themselves**.
Ultimately, the]{.underline} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
([[IPCC) concluded]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[more than
[half]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of the warming]{.underline} since 1951
[[is due to human activities]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Earth\'s [climate
can certainly fluctuate]{.underline} from year to year due to natural
forces (including oscillations in the Pacific Ocean, like El Niño).
**[But greenhouse gases are driving the larger upward trend in
temperatures]{.underline}**.

than [1.5]{.mark} degrees **[C]{.mark}**elsius. Bad news]{.underline}:
the 132 authors of the 700-page report offer many ideas but no feasible
plan for how to do that. As the International Panel on Climate Change's
co-chair put it, "One thing [the report did not]{.underline} aspire to
do is **[answer the question of feasibility]{.underline}**." So we can
call it the Beach Boys Report ― "Wouldn't it be nice\..."

The 2015 [Paris]{.underline} Agreement [set an overall goal of staying
below 2 degrees Celsius]{.underline} of global warming. However, the
combination of the deal's country-by-country goals would not accomplish
that, and no major country is on track to meet its goals anyway. [The
1.5 degree target is rightly even more ambitious]{.underline}, but also
even further from the reality of energy systems in the world today.

[In the first part of the 21st century, the fastest-growing energy
source was coal]{.underline}. And energy use is going up rapidly because
poor countries want to be richer ― and have a right to be. **[Climate
goals and realities are not converging]{.underline}**.

[The main mitigation scenarios in the [IPCC's]{.mark} new [report
depend]{.mark} heavily [on wind and solar]{.mark} power. [These
are]{.mark}]{.underline} both important parts of a solution, but they
are [harder and [harder to deploy as they constitute more of the]{.mark}
power [grid]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's [because]{.underline} the
**[[outputs]{.underline}]{.mark}** of wind and solar sources
**[[vary]{.underline}]{.mark}** ― between day and night, between winter
and summer, and often **[unpredictably]{.underline}**. The desperately
needed [[tech]{.mark}nologies [to]{.mark} affordably [store]{.mark} such
renewable energy [are still developing]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [renewable energies are diffuse]{.underline}, using large
amounts of land, steel and concrete per unit of electricity generated,
[which makes it harder to expand them at the scale and pace called for
by the IPCC's dire timeline]{.underline}.

[Other steps can also move us in the right direction without getting
close to the goal]{.underline}. Individuals can stop eating meat and
start taking public transportation. Air conditioners can become more
efficient. Farmers can change fertilizer practices. But [all of these
put together won't do nearly enough, and time is running
out]{.underline}.

Here's a different idea: Let's [look at [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}
or regions [that have successfully cut carbon emissions]{.underline}.
For the all-important electricity sector, the website electricitymap.org
shows how many grams of carbon pollution a region creates for each
kilowatt-hour of electricity it generates. For the world, the average is
now about 500. It needs to drop below 50 within a couple of decades to
prevent disaster.

In this effort, [the world can be divided into three general tiers:
places that use mostly coal]{.underline}, including Poland, India, China
and Australia (they produce about 700 to 800 grams CO2/kWh); [places
that have mostly replaced coal with natural gas and some
renewables]{.underline}, such as the United States and Germany (about
500 grams; California has reached 200-300 grams with great effort); [and
places that [have]{.mark} **miraculously [decarbonized their
grids]{.mark}**]{.underline} to below 50 grams.

It's true ― some places have already reached that goal.

[[Only two methods]{.mark} of electricity generation [account for this.
Some]{.mark} countries]{.underline} such as Norway and Uruguay [are
lucky enough to [have vast hydroelectric]{.mark} capacity. [Most]{.mark}
nations [don't]{.mark}]{.underline}, and new hydropower comes at
enormous cost to ecosystems.

[The [other decarbonized grids]{.mark} can be found in places that
**[rely on nuclear]{.mark} power**]{.underline}, such as France, Sweden,
and Ontario, Canada. [[Nuclear]{.mark} power is free of carbon
pollution]{.underline}; is [highly concentrated, which minimizes
environmental impacts]{.underline} such as those from mining and waste;
[and [operates 24/7 without]{.mark} needing
[batteries]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most importantly, **[[it can scale up
rapidly]{.underline}]{.mark}** ― [**[exactly what's needed]{.mark}** to
bring the IPCC's goals out of fantasyland]{.underline}. Based on our
analysis of many countries' experiences, [[what might take a
century]{.mark} to do [with renewables]{.mark} alone [could be done in
**20 years with nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} power.

Isn't n-n-nuclear too dangerous, too expensive, too creepy? Well, no.
It's thousands of times safer than coal, which kills hundreds of
thousands of people each year. Actually, nuclear power is the safest
form of energy ever used, in terms of deaths per unit of energy.

[Nuclear]{.underline} also [generates far less waste than other energy
sources, including renewables]{.underline}. The spent fuel from a
lifetime of electricity use by an average American generated entirely
from nuclear power would fit in a soda can. Someday we'll bury it, but
[for now the [waste can be left safely in]{.mark} its [dry
casks]{.mark}, certified for a hundred years, [while we attend
to]{.mark} bigger issues like **[saving the
planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Doesn't nuclear]{.mark} power [contribute to]{.mark} nuclear weapons
**[prolif]{.mark}**eration[**?** **No**]{.mark}. Weapons programs do not
depend on civilian nuclear power]{.underline}, which operates under
stringent international safeguards. [The most [problematic nuclear
weapons countries]{.mark}, such as North Korea, [do not]{.mark} even
[have civilian nuclear]{.mark} power]{.underline}. In fact, nuclear
electricity has enabled disarmament, as nearly 10 percent of U.S.
electricity in the last two decades came from dismantled Russian
warheads.

[[Nuclear]{.mark} power **[needn't be too expensive]{.mark}**
either]{.underline}. Existing U.S. nuclear plants, which generate
one-fifth of the nation's electricity, produce less expensive power than
either coal or gas. [In South Korea, electricity from nuclear power
costs less than 4 cents/kWh, which is cheaper than that from any other
source. [The key]{.mark} to replicating South Korea's low costs
[is]{.mark} to focus on repeatedly building a [standardized
design]{.mark}]{.underline}, which brings costs down to \$2 billion per
gigawatt. That's about double the capital cost of a U.S. natural gas
power plant, but half that of a U.S. coal plant and less than half of
wind and solar power facilities with equivalent production.

The problem in North America and Europe is that older nuclear plants
cost much less than new ones, even though we have better technologies
today. The latest U.S. attempts to build nuclear power escalated to \$12
billion per gigawatt. But then unlike South Korea, the United States has
gone decades without practice.

Both [Sweden and France have powered growing economies for decades on
cheap nuclear power]{.underline}. Both transitioned off fossil
electricity in less than 20 years. [There is **no reason the world can't
do the same now**]{.underline}.

[The IPCC has told us how urgently the world needs to decarbonize [to
**prevent**]{.mark} **a [climate catastrophe]{.mark}**[. We]{.mark} need
a realistic plan. It will include huge increases in renewable
power]{.underline}, greater energy efficiency and shifts in agriculture.
[**It must also include building [100]{.mark} to 200 [new]{.mark}
nuclear [reactors]{.mark} worldwide [each year]{.mark}** for the next
few decades]{.underline}. Instead of merely taking steps in the right
direction that don't add up, [the world needs to get moving along
[this]{.mark} **proven, feasible [path]{.mark} to [save our
planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy\-\--A2: Other Tech Solves

#### Wide-scale nuclear adoption's the only way to stop catastrophic warming 

James **Hansen 15**, Director of the Program on Climate Science,
Awareness and Solutions of the Earth Institute at Columbia University;
Kerry Emanuel, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Atmospheric Science
and co-director of the Lorenz Center at MIT; Ken Caldeira, climate
scientist in the Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Global
Ecology and Professor in the Department of Earth System Science at
Stanford University; and Tom Wigley, climate scientist at the University
of Adelaide, 12/3/15, "Nuclear power paves the only viable path forward
on climate change,"
<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/03/nuclear-power-paves-the-only-viable-path-forward-on-climate-change>

All four of us have dedicated our scientific careers to understand the
processes and impacts of climate change, variously studying ocean
systems, tropical cyclones, ice sheets and ecosystems as well as impacts
on human societies. We have used both climate models and geological
records of past climates to better understand lessons from warmer
periods in the Earth's history and investigate future scenarios.

We have become so concerned about humanity's slow response to this
challenge that we have decided [we must clearly set out]{.underline}
what we see as [**the only viable path forward**. As scientists we do
not take advocacy positions lightly]{.underline}, but we believe the
magnitude of climate change now presents an unprecedented moral
challenge that compels us to speak out.

[[To avoid the worst effects of climate change]{.mark},
including]{.underline} continued sea level rise, the total loss of
Arctic sea ice and [[devastating effects on human societies and]{.mark}
natural [ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline} alike, [[rapid global
decarbonisation is needed]{.underline}]{.mark}. The voluntary measures
put on the table at Paris by over 100 nations are a welcome step, but
[unless there are strong measures to reduce emissions beyond 2030,
global emissions would remain at a high level]{.underline}, practically
[guaranteeing]{.underline} that young people inherit [a climate running
out of]{.underline} their [control]{.underline}. A new and intensified
approach is clearly needed.

Everyone agrees that [the [most urgent]{.mark} component of
decarbonisation [is]{.mark} a move towards]{.underline} clean energy,
and **[[clean electricity]{.underline}]{.mark}** in particular. We need
affordable, abundant clean energy, but [there is no particular reason
why we should favour renewable energy over other forms of abundant
energy]{.underline}. Indeed, cutting down forests for bioenergy and
damming rivers for hydropower -- both commonly counted as renewable
energy sources -- can have terrible environmental consequences.

[**Nuclear power**, **particularly** [next-generation nuclear]{.mark}
power [with a closed fuel cycle (where]{.mark} spent [fuel is
**reprocessed**), is **uniquely scalable**, and environmentally
advantageous]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the past 50 years, nuclear power
stations -- by offsetting fossil fuel combustion -- have avoided the
emission of an estimated 60bn tonnes of carbon dioxide.
[[Nuclear]{.mark} energy [can **power whole
civilisations**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and produce waste streams that are
trivial compared to the waste produced by fossil fuel combustion.
[[There are]{.mark} technical [means to dispose of]{.mark} this small
amount of [waste]{.mark} safely]{.underline}. However, nuclear does pose
unique safety and proliferation concerns that must be addressed with
strong and binding international standards and safeguards. Most
importantly for climate, nuclear produces no CO2 during power
generation.

To solve the climate problem, policy must be based on facts and not on
prejudice. [The climate system **cares about**]{.underline} greenhouse
gas **[emissions]{.underline}** -- [not]{.underline} about [whether
energy comes from renewable power or]{.underline} abundant
[nuclear]{.underline} power. [Some have argued]{.underline} that [it is
feasible to meet all of our energy needs with renewables. The [100%
renewable scenarios]{.mark} **downplay or [ignore]{.mark}**]{.underline}
the **[[intermittency]{.underline}]{.mark}** issue [[by making
unrealistic]{.mark} technical [assumptions, and]{.mark} can [contain
**high levels of biomass and hydroelectric**]{.mark}]{.underline} power
[[at]{.mark} the [expense of]{.mark} true [sustainability]{.mark}. Large
amounts of nuclear]{.underline} power would [make it much easier for
solar and wind to close the energy gap]{.underline}.

The climate issue is too important for us to delude ourselves with
wishful thinking. [Throwing]{.underline} tools such as [nuclear out of
the box constrains humanity's options and **makes climate mitigation
more likely to fail**]{.underline}. We urge an all-of-the-above approach
that includes increased investment in renewables combined with an
accelerated deployment of new nuclear reactors.

For example, [a build rate of [61 new reactors per year could]{.mark}
**entirely [replace]{.mark} current [fossil fuel]{.mark} electricity
[generation by 2050]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Accounting for increased
global electricity demand driven by population growth and development in
poorer countries, which would add another 54 reactors per year, this
makes a total requirement of 115 reactors per year to 2050 to entirely
decarbonise the global electricity system in this illustrative scenario.
[[We **know**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[this is]{.mark} technically
[achievable]{.mark}]{.underline} because France and Sweden were able to
ramp up nuclear power to high levels in just 15-20 years.

[[Nuclear will **make the difference** between]{.mark} the world
**[missing]{.mark} crucial [climate targets or achieving
them]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We are hopeful in the knowledge that,
together with renewables, [nuclear can help bridge the 'emissions
gap']{.underline} that bedevils the Paris climate negotiations. [[The
**future of our planet**]{.underline}]{.mark} and our descendants
[[depends on]{.underline}]{.mark} basing decisions on facts, and letting
go of long-held biases when it comes to **[[nuclear
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy\-\--A2: War Outweighs

#### Unchecked warming causes [nuclear war]{.underline} and magnifies every [geopolitical impact]{.underline} 

Jürgen **Scheffran 16**, Professor at the Institute for Geography at the
University of Hamburg and head of the Research Group Climate Change and
Security in the CliSAP Cluster of Excellence and the Center for Earth
System Research and Sustainability, et al., April 2016, "The
Climate-Nuclear Nexus: Exploring the linkages between climate change and
nuclear threats,"
http://www.worldfuturecouncil.org/file/2016/01/WFC_2015_The_Climate-Nuclear_Nexus.pdf

Climate change and nuclear weapons represent two key threats of our
time. [[Climate change endangers ecosystems]{.mark} and social systems
[all over the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [degradation
of]{.underline} natural [resources]{.underline}, the [[decline of water
and food]{.underline}]{.mark} supplies, [forced [migration]{.mark},
and]{.underline} more frequent and intense [[disasters]{.mark}
will]{.underline} greatly [affect population clusters]{.underline}, big
and small. [Climate-related shocks will [add stress to]{.mark} the
world's [existing conflicts]{.mark} and act [as a "threat
multiplier]{.mark}" in already fragile regions]{.underline}. [[This
could]{.mark} contribute to a [decline]{.mark} of [international
stability and trigger hostility between]{.mark}]{.underline} people and
[[nations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile, the 15,500 [[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} that remain in the arsenals of only a few
states [[possess]{.underline}]{.mark} the [destructive [force to destroy
life on Earth]{.mark}]{.underline} as we know multiple times over.
[With]{.underline} nuclear deterrence strategies still in place, and
[hundreds of weapons on 'hair trigger alert', the [risks of nuclear
war]{.mark} caused [by accident, miscalc]{.mark}ulation [or intent
remain]{.mark}]{.underline} [[plentiful]{.mark} and
imminent]{.underline}.

Despite growing recognition that climate change and nuclear weapons pose
critical security risks, the linkages between both threats are largely
ignored. However, nuclear and climate risks interfere with each other in
a mutually enforcing way.

[[Conflicts induced by climate change could contribute to global
insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}, which, in turn, could [[enhance the
chance]{.mark} [of a nuclear weapon being used]{.mark}]{.underline},
could [[create]{.mark} more fertile breeding grounds for
terrorism]{.underline}, [including [nuclear
terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} could
[[feed]{.mark} the [ambitions among]{.mark}]{.underline} some [[states
to acquire nuclear arms]{.underline}]{.mark}. Furthermore, as evidenced
by a series of incidents in recent years, extreme weather events,
environmental degradation and major seismic events can directly impact
the safety and security of nuclear installations. Moreover, a [[nuclear
war could lead to]{.mark} a [rapid]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[prolonged
drop in]{.mark} average [global temperatures]{.mark} and significantly
disrupt the global climate for years]{.underline} to come, which would
have disastrous implications for agriculture, [threatening the food
supply for most of the world]{.underline}. Finally, climate change,
nuclear weapons and nuclear energy pose threats of intergenerational
harm, as evidenced by the transgenerational effects of nuclear testing
and nuclear power accidents and the lasting impacts on the climate,
environment and public health by carbon emissions.

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy\-\--New Impact\-\--Water

#### Nuke power's key to [global desalinization]{.underline}\-\--prevents water wars

**Beller, 4** - Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of
Nevada, Las Vegas (Dr. Denis E, "Atomic Time Machines: Back to the
Nuclear Future," 24 J. Land Resources & Envtl. L. 41, 2004)

Our [[global neighbors need]{.mark} much [more
energy]{.mark}]{.underline} to achieve the standards of living of the
developed world. One-third of the six billion people on Earth today lack
access to electricity. 3 Another two billion use just 1000 kilowatt
hours (kWh) per year, which is barely enough to keep a single 100-watt
light bulb lit. 4 In addition, [[one billion]{.mark} people [have
no]{.mark} sanitary [water]{.mark}]{.underline}, 5 [[which
could]{.underline}]{.mark} \[\*43\] [[be provided easily and
inexpensively if energy were available to operate
desalination]{.underline}]{.mark} and/or purification
[[plants]{.underline}]{.mark}. Energy is needed for development,
prosperity, health, and international security. [[The
alternative]{.mark} to development]{.underline}, which is easily
sustained with ample energy, [[is]{.mark} suffering in the form of
[poverty, disease, and death. This]{.mark}]{.underline} suffering
[[creates **instability** and]{.mark} the potential for **[widespread
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such that national security requires
developed nations to help increase energy production in their more
populous developing counterparts.

The relationship between energy use and human well being is demonstrated
by correlating the United Nations\' Human Development Index (HDI) with
the annual per capita use of electricity. The UN compiles the HDI for
almost every nation annually. It is a composite of average education
level, health and well being (average life expectancy), and per capita
income or gross domestic product. One such correlation that was done a
few years ago showed that electric consumption first increases human
well being, then people who are well off increase their electric
consumption. 6 Figure 1 illustrates this for almost every nation on
Earth (the data includes more than 90 percent of the Earth\'s
population). Note there is a threshold at about 4000 kWh per capita.
Below this threshold, human development increases rapidly with increases
in available electricity (there are, of course, exceptions to every
rule). Above this threshold, use of electricity increases rapidly as
people become more healthy, wealthy, and educated. A deeper
investigation into the data underlying the HDI reveals the effects of
what Dr. Eric Loewen, a delegate to the United Nations 2002 World Summit
on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg, South Africa, now calls
\"energy apartheid.\" 7 People in the Western world, who have and use
large amounts of energy, have a life expectancy of about eighty years,
while those on the lower left side of this graph, undeveloped nations
where most people have no access to electricity, will die decades
earlier. Thus, billions of our global neighbors without sufficient
electricity die decades before they should. Those who live in poverty
live in the most dangerous of conditions.

[[Without substantial increases in electricity generation, the
proportion of the]{.mark} Earth\'s [population without]{.mark}
sufficient [electricity will increase]{.mark} in the next fifty years
[as it grows]{.mark} by 50 percent to near 9 billion
people]{.underline}. 8 [[Preventing **global conflict will**
require]{.mark} even [more]{.mark} addition of
[electricity]{.mark}]{.underline}. The product of increased population
and increased per capita energy usage by people who today have access to
nearly none is a great growth in global electricity usage. Estimates
\[\*44\] for future increases in energy and electricity use, even with
substantial efficiency improvements and conservation efforts, range
between doubling and tripling in the next fifty years. 9 Even with
conservation, \"energy star\" appliances and homes, mandated fuel
economy, massive government purchases of \"renewables,\" and energy
saving and efficiency measures, our use of electrical energy has been
growing faster than total energy usage; electricity use in the United
States increased 57 percent between 1980 and 2000, while total energy
use increased just 27 percent. 10

### New Mod\-\--Nuke Energy\-\--New Impact\-\--Water\-\--A2: No Wars

#### Water shortages are [escalating]{.underline} and spark [nuclear conflict]{.underline}

**NASCA 4** (National Association for Scientific and Cultural
Appreciation, "Water Shortages -- Only a Matter of Time",
<http://www.nasca.org.uk/Strange_relics_/water/water.html>)

[Water is one of the prime essentials for life]{.underline} as we know
it. The plain fact is - [no water, no life]{.underline}! This becomes
all the more worrying when we realise that [the worlds [supply
of]{.mark}]{.underline} drinkable [[water will soon
diminish]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[rapidly]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
fact a recent report commissioned by the United Nations has emphasised
that [by]{.underline} the year [2025]{.underline} at least [[66%]{.mark}
of the worlds population [will be without]{.mark}]{.underline} an
[[adequate]{.mark} water [supply. As a disaster in the making water
shortage ranks in the top category. Without water we are
finished]{.mark}]{.underline}, and it is thus imperative that we protect
the mechanism through which we derive our supply of this life giving
fluid. Unfortunately the exact opposite is the case. We are doing
incalculable damage to the planets capacity to generate water and [this
will have far ranging consequences]{.underline} for the not too distant
future. The United Nations has warned that burning of fossil fuels is
the prime cause of water shortage. While there may be other reasons such
as increased solar activity it is clear that this is a situation over
which we can exert a great deal of control. If not then the future will
be very bleak indeed! Already the warning signs are there. The last year
has seen devastating heatwaves in many parts of the world including the
USA where the state of Texas experienced its worst drought on record.
Elsewhere in the United States forest fires raged out of control, while
other regions of the globe experienced drought conditions that were even
more severe. Parts of [Iran, Afgahnistan, China and]{.underline} other
[neighbouring countries experienced]{.underline} their [worst droughts
on record. These]{.underline} conditions also [extended
throughout]{.underline} many parts of [Africa]{.underline} and it is
clear that [if circumstances remain unchanged we are facing a disaster
of epic proportions]{.underline}. Moreover it will be one for which
there is no easy answer. The spectre of a world water shortage evokes a
truly frightening scenario. In fact the United Nations warns that
[[disputes over water will become the prime source of conflict]{.mark}
in the]{.underline} not too distant [future]{.underline}. Where these
[[shortages]{.underline}]{.mark} become ever more acute it
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} forseeably [[lead to]{.underline}]{.mark}
the brink of [[nuclear conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. On a lesser scale
water, and the price of it, will acquire an importance somewhat like the
current value placed on oil. The difference of course is that while oil
is not vital for life, water most certainly is! It seems clear then that
in future years countries rich in water will enjoy an importance that
perhaps they do not have today. In these circumstances [[power
shifts]{.mark} are inevitable, and]{.underline} this
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} undoubtedly [[create]{.underline}]{.mark}
its own [[strife and tension]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the long term the
implications do not look encouraging. It is a two edged sword. First the
shortage of water, and then the increased stresses this will impose upon
an already stressed world of politics. It means that answers need to be
found immediately. Answers that will both ameliorate the damage to the
environment, and also find new sources of water for future consumption.
[If]{.underline} not, and [the problem is left unresolved]{.underline}
[there will]{.underline} eventually [come the day when
[we]{.mark}]{.underline} shall [[find]{.underline}]{.mark} ourselves
with [[a nightmare situation]{.mark} for which there will be
no]{.underline} obvious [answer]{.underline}.

#### Hotspots will erupt globally

**Chellaney 14** -- Brahma Chellaney, Professor of Strategic Studies at
the Centre for Policy Research, "The Coming Era of Water Wars",
Washington Times, 3-13,
<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/13/chellaney-the-coming-era-of-water-wars/?page=all>

[Adequate availability of [water]{.mark}]{.underline}, food and energy
[[is critical to global security]{.mark}. Water]{.underline}, the
sustainer of life and livelihoods, [is already the world's most
exploited natural resource]{.underline}.

[[With]{.underline}]{.mark} nature's [freshwater]{.underline} renewable
[[capacity lagging]{.mark} behind]{.underline} humanity's [current rate
of utilization, [tomorrow's water is]{.mark} being [used]{.mark} to meet
[today]{.mark}'s need]{.underline}.

Consequently, the resources of shared rivers,
[[aquifers]{.underline}]{.mark} and lakes [[have become the target
of]{.mark} rival [appropriation]{.mark}]{.underline} plans. [Securing a
larger portion of]{.underline} the [shared water has fostered increasing
competition between countries]{.underline} and provinces.

Efforts by some countries to turn transnational water resources into an
instrument of power has encouraged a dam-building race and prompted
growing calls for the United Nations to make water a key security
concern.

More ominously, [the [struggle]{.mark} for water [is exacerbating
impacts on]{.mark} the earth's [ecosystems]{.mark}. Humanity is altering
freshwater and]{.underline} other [ecosystems]{.underline} more
[rapidly]{.underline} than its own scientific understanding of the
implications of such change.

[[Degradation]{.mark} of water resources [has resulted in]{.mark}
aquatic [ecosystems losing half of]{.mark} their
[biodiversity]{.mark}]{.underline} since just the mid-1970s. Groundwater
depletion, for its part, is affecting natural streamflows,
groundwater-fed wetlands and lakes, and related ecosystems.

[[The **future of**]{.mark} **human [civilization]{.mark}** [hinges on
sustainable development]{.mark}. If resources like water are
degraded]{.underline} and depleted, [[**environmental refugees** will
follow]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Sanaa in [Yemen risks]{.underline} becoming the first capital city to
[run out of water]{.underline}. If [[Bangladesh]{.underline}]{.mark}
bears the main impact of China's damming of River Brahmaputra, the
resulting exodus of thirsty [refugees [will compound **India**'s
security challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Internal resource conflicts are often camouflaged as civil wars.
**Sudan's** [Darfur]{.mark} conflict]{.underline}, for example, [[arose
from]{.underline}]{.mark} water and grassland
[[scarcity]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Interstate water wars in a political and economic sense are being waged
in several regions, including by building dams on international rivers
and by resorting to coercive diplomacy to prevent such construction.

[Examples include **[China's]{.mark}**]{.underline} frenetic upstream
[[dam building]{.underline}]{.mark} in its borderlands,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} downriver [[**Egypt**'s threats]{.mark}
of]{.underline} military [reprisals against]{.underline} the ongoing
[Ethiopia]{.underline}n construction of a large dam on the Blue Nile.

Upstream [Turkey]{.underline}, inspired by China's strengthening
hydro-hegemony, [is accelerating its diversion]{.underline} of the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers. [This [will exacerbate]{.mark} water
[stress in]{.mark}]{.underline} the two violence-torn, downriver states
of [[**Syria** and **Iraq**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Meanwhile, [Israel]{.underline}, with its control of the water-rich
Golan Heights and the West Bank aquifers, [has leveraged its role as
water supplier to Palestinians and Jordanians]{.underline}.

The yearly global economic losses from water shortages are
conservatively estimated at \$260 billion.

Water-stressed South Korea is encouraging its corporate giants to
produce water-intensive items --- from food to steel --- for the home
market in overseas lands. This strategy has created a grass-roots
backlash against South Korean firms in Madagascar and India's Odisha
state.

A report reflecting the joint judgment of U.S. intelligence agencies has
warned that the use of water as a weapon of war or a tool of terrorism
would become more likely in the next decade.

Water is a renewable but finite resource. Unlike mineral ores, fossils
fuels and resources from the biosphere such as fish and timber, water
(unless bottled) is not a globally traded commodity. The human
population has doubled since 1970 alone, though, while the global
economy has grown even faster.

[[Consumption growth]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is the]{.mark}
single [biggest driver]{.mark} of water stress. [Rising
incomes]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [have promoted
[chang]{.mark}ing [diets]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially a greater
intake [[of meat, whose production is]{.underline}]{.mark} notoriously
[[water-intensive]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In China, South Korea and Southeast Asia, traditional diets have been
transformed in the past generation alone, becoming much meatier.

If the world stopped diverting food to feed livestock and produce
biofuels, it could not only abolish hunger, but also feed a population
larger by four billion, according to a University of Minnesota study.

Compounding the diet-change impacts on the global water situation is the
increasing body-mass index of humans in recent decades, with the
prevalence of obesity doubling since the 1980s.

Obesity rates in important economies now range from 33 percent in the
United States and 26.9 percent in Britain to 5.7 percent in China and
1.9 percent in India.

Heavier citizens make heavier demands on natural resources, especially
water and energy. They also cause much greater greenhouse-gas emissions
through their bigger food and transport needs.

A study published in the British journal BMC Public Health found that if
the rest of the world had the same average body-mass index as the United
States, it would be equivalent to adding nearly an extra billion people
to the global population, with major implications for the world's water
situation.

The issue thus isn't just about how many mouths there are to feed, but
also about how much excess body fat there is on the planet.

The point to note is that a net population increase usually translates
into greater human capital to create innovations, power economic growth
and support the elderly, but a net increase in body weight only
contributes to state liability and greater water stress.

[[Preventing **water wars** demands]{.underline}]{.mark} rules-based
cooperation, [water-[sharing]{.mark}]{.underline} and dispute-settlement
mechanisms.

[However, [most]{.mark} of the world's transnational [basins **lack any
cooperative arrangement**]{.mark}, and there is still no international
water law in force]{.underline}. Worse, unilateralist appropriation of
shared water resources is endemic where autocrats rule.

### A2: Turn\-\--Cred Good

#### Their turn is about soft power -- that's [high]{.underline} and [resilient]{.underline} -- US unrivaled and government actions [won't cause collapse]{.underline} -- Soft Power is [NOT]{.underline} from them and hard power backs it up

Much of [[America\'s soft power is]{.mark} produced by civil
society]{.underline} \-- everything [[from
universities]{.mark}]{.underline} and foundations [[to]{.mark}
Hollywood]{.underline} [and pop [culture]{.mark}]{.underline} \--
**[[not]{.mark} from the [government]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Sometimes
[the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[is able to preserve]{.underline}]{.mark} a degree of [[soft power
because of]{.mark} its]{.underline} [[critical]{.underline}]{.mark} and
uncensored [civil [society **even when government actions**]{.mark} \--
like]{.underline} the invasion of [Iraq \-- [are]{.mark} otherwise
[undermining]{.mark} it]{.underline}. But in a smart power strategy,
[[hard and soft **reinforce**]{.mark} **each other**]{.underline}. In
his new book, China Goes Global, George Washington University\'s David
[Shambaugh shows how [China has spent billions]{.mark}]{.underline} of
dollars on a charm offensive to increase its soft power. Chinese aid
programs to Africa and Latin America are not limited by the
institutional or human rights concerns that constrain Western aid. The
Chinese style emphasizes high-profile gestures. [[But]{.mark} for all
its efforts, China has [earned a **limited return**]{.mark}]{.underline}
on its investment. Polls show that opinions of China\'s influence are
positive in much of Africa and Latin America, but predominantly negative
in the United States, Europe, as well as India, Japan and South Korea.

#### Soft power doesn't solve -- Ukraine and previous Russian examples prove, realism/hard power dominate foreign affairs, only civil society (not government) can leverage it, terrible track record, leaders don't know how to operationalize

The Russian [invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} has already
**[[punctured]{.mark} much of the prevailing
[foreign-policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** thinking [that had become pro
forma in Washington]{.underline} and Europe. [In
particular]{.underline}, the notion [that]{.underline} Western
unilateral disarmament can somehow be balanced or compensated for with
less tangible forms of influence---[soft power---has much to answer for
in this ongoing crisis]{.underline}. By now, it is clear that
[[Moscow's]{.mark} [actions]{.mark}]{.underline} in Crimea [**[strongly
demonstrate]{.mark} the [sharp limits of soft
power]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[especially]{.underline}]{.mark} one that
appears to have been [[decoupled from hard power, the]{.mark}
**traditional [final arbiter]{.mark}** of interstate
relations]{.underline}. [Ukraine is not merely a geopolitical setback,
but a **symptom of a misplaced faith** in]{.underline} the potency of
postmodern [soft power]{.underline} as foreign policy plan A through Z.
Ukraine's rapid transformation from homo Sovieticus--ruled kleptocracy
to inspiring popular revolution to the latest victim of Russian
imperialism has been astonishing. In the span of mere weeks, Ukraine's
political cleavages have been magnified as the faultline of a tense
geopolitical contest between the Euro-Atlantic community and a
revanchist, increasingly militant Russia. In the Western scramble to
come to terms with the new threat landscape---let alone formulating an
effective, unified response---Crimea has almost certainly already been
lost. Meanwhile, Russia seems poised to expand its writ into other areas
of eastern Ukraine just as it aggressively probes Euro-Atlantic
readiness in the Baltic, Turkey, and the Caucasus. [In
Washington]{.underline}, defense and administration [officials appear
resigned---]{.underline}if only unofficially---[to Russian control over
Crimea]{.underline} (if not eastern Ukraine) [and are digging in for the
long haul]{.underline}. [How did we get here]{.underline}? Among the
ideologues, the answer lies in the foreign policies of the current or
previous administrations. On the right, President Obama's "reset" and
subordination of foreign policy to domestic issues is the obvious cause.
And on the left, President Bush's wars have given the Kremlin the
perfect moral justification. But the reality, like many things, is
hardly one sided. Partisans decrying President Obama's "weakness" appear
to ignore that the administration\'s response to Russia's occupation of
Crimea is already far more muscular than President Bush's reaction to
the Russian invasion of Georgia 2008. And conversely, some of the left's
bizarre use of a war they supposedly opposed to equivocate on the
invasion of a sovereign state by corrupt autocracy is as
self-contradictory as it is troubling. [The likelier culprit
is]{.underline} not so intimately tethered to the tribalisms of American
politics, though ideology inevitably has played a role. Instead, [the
[Western]{.mark} political [class]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has
become]{.underline} [**intoxicated** with]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
notion that [soft power]{.mark},]{.underline} now the highly fashionable
foreign-policy instrument of first resort[, can compensate
for]{.underline}---or in some ways replace altogether---[diminished hard
power]{.underline}. If the late 1990s was the heyday for liberal
internationalism by airpower, the late 2000s saw an analogous consensus
congregate around soft power. Soft power is supposed to describe the
latent factors---values, economy, culture and the like---of a state,
entity or idea to persuade or attract. This contrasts with its more
recognizable counterpart, hard power, which is based on the more
traditional principle of coercion. [There is little doubt that soft
power is a real and fundamentally important phenomenon]{.underline} in
the conduct of international relations. Contributions from scholars like
Joseph Nye and Giulio Gallarotti have made a compelling case that soft
power is a powerful geopolitical signifier; [but [what began as a keen
observation had morphed into]{.mark} a [cottage industry]{.mark} looking
to leverage soft power into a foreign-policy panacea]{.underline}. In an
illuminating 2011 paper published by the Strategic Studies Institute at
the U.S. Army War College, University of Reading (U.K.) political
scientist Colin S. [[Gray rightly acknowledges]{.mark} the merits of the
soft-power thesis while articulating its practical
[limitations]{.mark},]{.underline} particularly in the policy arena.
"[While]{.underline} it is [sensible to seek influence abroad as
cost-effectively as possible, [it is]{.mark} **only [prudent to be
modest]{.mark}** in]{.underline} one\'s [expectations of]{.underline}
the [soft power]{.underline} to be secured by cultural influence,"
cautions Gray. Indeed, soft power's attraction and subsequent embrace by
the foreign policy elite had as much to do with its usefulness as a
substitute for "hard power" as its salience as an idea. But [while hard
and soft power can be complementary]{.underline}, Gray observes that
[[soft power can in **no way compensate**]{.mark} **for military
power**. "Sad to say," laments Gray, "[there is **no**]{.mark}
**convincing [evidence]{.mark}** [suggesting]{.mark} an [absence of
demand for]{.mark} the threat and use of military
[force]{.mark}."]{.underline} Sad, indeed. However, events in
[Ukraine]{.underline} have [exposed the **stark limits of soft power**
in a way that no analysis ever could.]{.underline} [[There is no]{.mark}
small [irony]{.mark}]{.underline} in the fact that [[Russia's]{.mark}
forceful military [intervention]{.mark}]{.underline} into Ukraine [[was
preceded by a grinding]{.underline}]{.mark}, if superficially velveted,
[[tug of war between]{.mark} Moscow and the West]{.underline} over
Ukraine's integration with two competing [[soft-power
"vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark}"---the EU and the Moscow-led Customs
Union-cum-Eurasian Union. It was Yanukovych's abandonment of Ukraine's
pledge to sign an Association Agreement with the EU---following intense
Russian coercion---that protests began again in earnest. Yanukovych's
turn to brutality eventually precipitated his toppling, Russia's
military intervention, and now Crimea's annexation. [**The idea of [soft
power as]{.mark} operational [policy should be buried]{.mark}.** While
there is some government role]{.underline} in propagating and wielding
soft power---public affairs, policy making, and, yes, sometimes
psychological operations---[the [real]{.mark} business of [soft
power]{.mark}]{.underline} is **[[exists]{.mark} well [outside]{.mark}
of the domain of [the state]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [In reality, the
[track record of operationalizing]{.mark} soft power [has been]{.mark},
to date, **[abysmal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Russia is a case in
point]{.underline}. [Moscow repeatedly sought to revise the post-Cold
War order]{.underline} through a variety of projects that might normally
be filed as soft-power initiatives: then president Dmitry Medvedev's
repeated attempts to reorient the European security architecture; the
Kremlin obsession with making the ruble an international reserve
currency; the formation of the Russia-led Customs Union in 2010; and the
(now likely stillborn) plans to establish the Eurasian Union. [And yet,
**in the end,** Crimea was forcibly seized by]{.underline} ~~men~~
[\[people\] with guns. Indeed, the [truer currency]{.mark}]{.underline}
of power **[[remains the ability to coerce]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[Fatigue from]{.underline}]{.mark} disastrous wars in [[Iraq and
Afghanistan elevated expectations]{.underline}]{.mark} that [soft power
could supplant a beleaguered]{.underline} and overstretched U.S.
[military]{.underline}. Why, indeed, would the U.S. opt for coercion
when civilizational persuasion could do the trick? [Pro-West people
power in Eurasia seemed to bolster the case for operationalized soft
power after the "color revolutions]{.underline}" in Georgia, Ukraine and
Kyrgyzstan. [[Yet]{.mark} the longer-term [results were **unpredictable
at best and disastrous at worst**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over time, [[it
has become]{.mark} **increasingly [apparent]{.mark}** that [soft power
is]{.mark} perhaps [less an instrument]{.mark} to wield [than a
**favorable wind**]{.mark} **at our backs**]{.underline}. [The crisis
with Russia has laid bare the limits of soft power as well as the
continued relevance of hard power]{.underline}---even in "postmodern"
Europe. While the Obama administration should be credited with being
among the few Western governments to offer a relatively serious response
to the Ukraine crisis, [the [White House]{.mark}]{.underline} overall
still [[seems uncomfortable with the]{.mark} difficult but very [real
role]{.mark} that [hard power]{.mark}]{.underline} [necessarily
[plays]{.mark}]{.underline} in establishing and policing a U.S.-led,
liberal normative order. [This must change with]{.underline} the new
circumstances established by [Russian revanchism]{.underline}. [Western
[values can **only** be]{.mark} [propagated]{.mark}]{.underline} and
upheld [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the ultimate guarantee of [[hard
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [if the West is not prepared to enforce
its values]{.underline} [with tangible consequences]{.underline}, then
perhaps **[we should abandon]{.underline}** the pretense of [a
rules-based international system and cease the cruel practice of giving
hope **where there is none to be had**.]{.underline} [[Soft
power]{.mark} is here to stay, but its moment [as a diplomatic
instrument **has**]{.mark} **long since [gone]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Because, [in reality, **[it was never]{.mark} really much [more than an
illusion]{.mark} of what we wished the world to be**]{.underline} rather
than the one that exists.

### A2: Turn\-\--Cred Good\-\--Ext\-\--Resilient

#### Soft power resilient

**Cox, 12** (Professor IR London School of Economics, '12 (Michael,
December, "Power Shifts, Economic Change and the Decline of the West?"
International Relations, Vol 26 No 4, p 369-388, SagePub)

If China has a real problem in projecting a positive and confident
picture of itself or of the world it would like to build, the same can
hardly be said of the United States. 92 [[The US]{.mark} may have
[lost]{.mark}]{.underline} good deal of [[standing]{.underline}]{.mark}
in the world [[because of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} War; meanwhile the West has clearly suffered
a setback because of the economic crisis. [[However]{.mark}, the first
was]{.underline} partially [vitiated by the election of
Obama]{.underline} in 2008, and the second has not led to anybody
serious proposing an alternative. Moreover, [[the
'West']{.underline}]{.mark} for all its faults -- growing inequality,
ethical standards in decline and all the rest -- [[still looks]{.mark} a
[more]{.mark} [attractive]{.mark} proposition [than anything
else]{.mark}]{.underline} on offer. As a recent study has shown, '[[soft
power' is]{.mark} almost entirely [the preserve of]{.mark}]{.underline}
Western, or more precisely democratic, countries with [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} still leading a
league table that includes most West European countries as well as two
countries from Asia -- Japan and South Korea. China on the other hand
comes in 20th, just ahead of Brazil at 21st, followed by India at 27th
and Russia 28th out of a total of 30 countries assessed. 93 There are
several reasons why the West continues to score well in terms of soft
power, the most obvious being that [Western countries have a [pluralist
political culture]{.mark}]{.underline} where having dissident views,
will not, by and large, end up with one spending a rather long term in
prison or worse. But another reason -- clearly connected -- has to do
with [its [open]{.mark} system of [higher
education]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here, [even the much-maligned United
States **[continues to have great magnetic pull,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
nowhere more so than in China itself, judging by the enormous number of
Chinese students who every year seek a place in US institutions of
higher learning. Many of them may in the end return to China. However,
they clearly believe that getting an education in a US college will
improve their job prospects in an increasingly tough Chinese job market.
94 Nor is this temporary 'brain drain' a mere accident of history.
Indeed, one of the more obvious signs of continued Western and American
strength is its university sector. 95 Other countries and continents
obviously have universities. But very few of them rank especially high
in international terms. 96 The BRIC countries in particular seem to face
almost insuperable difficulties in raising standards. Brazil and India
for example have no universities in the top 100, Russia only one and
China a mere five -- three of these being in Hong Kong. [The United
States]{.underline}, in 2011, meanwhile [remained home to 8 of the top
10 ranked universities in the world]{.underline}, 37 of the top 50 and
58 of the top 100. Even the United Kingdom does well, having 17 ranked
universities compared to a total of 13 in the whole of Asia. 97

When Foreign Policy first published my essay \"Soft Power\" in 1990, who
would have expected that someday the term would be used by the likes of
Hu Jintao or Vladimir Putin? Yet [[Hu told the
**C**]{.underline}]{.mark}hinese **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommunist
**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**arty in 2007 [that China **needed [to
increase]{.mark}** its [soft power]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Putin
recently urged Russian diplomats to apply soft power more extensively.
[[Neither]{.mark} leader]{.underline}, however, [seems to have
[understood **how**]{.mark}]{.underline} to accomplish his goals. Power
is the ability to affect others to get the outcomes one wants, and that
can be accomplished in three main ways \-- by coercion, payment, or
attraction. If you can add the soft power of attraction to your toolkit,
you can economize on carrots and sticks. For a rising power like China
whose growing economic and military might frightens its neighbors into
counter-balancing coalitions[, a smart strategy includes soft power to
make China look less frightening and]{.underline} the
[balancing]{.underline} coalitions [less effective]{.underline}. For a
declining power like Russia (or Britain before it), a residual soft
power helps to cushion the fall. [The [soft power]{.mark} of a country
[rests]{.mark}]{.underline} primarily [[on three
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}: its [culture]{.underline} (in places
where it is attractive to others), its [political values]{.underline}
(when it lives up to them at home and abroad), [and]{.underline} its
[foreign policies]{.underline} (when they are seen as legitimate and
having moral authority). [[But combining these]{.underline}]{.mark}
resources [[is **not**]{.mark} **always [easy]{.mark}**.
[Establishing]{.mark}]{.underline}, say, [a [Confucius]{.mark}
Institute]{.underline} in Manila to teach Chinese culture [[might
help]{.mark} produce soft power, [but it is **less likely to do so** in
a context where China]{.mark} has **[just bullied the]{.mark}
[Philippines]{.mark}** over]{.underline} possession of [Scarborough
Reef.]{.underline} Similarly, Putin has told his diplomats that \"the
priority has been shifting to the literate use of soft power,
strengthening positions of the Russian language,\" but as Russian
scholar Sergei Karaganov noted in the aftermath of the dispute with
Georgia, Russia has to use \"hard power, including military force,
because it lives in a much more dangerous world \... and because it has
little soft power \-- that is, social, cultural, political and economic
attractiveness.\" Much of America\'s soft power is produced by civil
society \-- everything from universities and foundations to Hollywood
and pop culture \-- not from the government. Sometimes the United States
is able to preserve a degree of soft power because of its critical and
uncensored civil society even when government actions \-- like the
invasion of Iraq \-- are otherwise undermining it. But in a smart power
strategy, hard and soft reinforce each other. In his new book, China
Goes Global, George Washington University\'s David [Shambaugh shows how
[China]{.mark} has [spent billions]{.mark} of dollars [on a charm
offensive]{.mark}]{.underline} to increase its soft power. Chinese aid
programs to Africa and Latin America are not limited by the
institutional or human rights concerns that constrain Western aid. The
Chinese style emphasizes high-profile gestures. [[But]{.mark} for all
its efforts, China has [earned **a limited return**]{.mark}]{.underline}
on its investment. [[Polls show]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[opinions]{.mark} of China\'s influence [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
positive in much of Africa and Latin America, but [**[predominantly

### 2AC\-\--UQ Overwhelms

#### Uniqueness overwhelms the link -- cred is [shot]{.underline} because of [first use]{.underline}, [nuclear orientalism,]{.underline} and [Trump]{.underline}

**Gusterson 18** \-\-\-- Hugh, Professor of Anthropology and
International Affairs (Elliott School of International Affairs -- George
Washington University), B.A. in history (Cambridge University),

anthropology (Stanford University), "Democracy, Hypocrisy, First Use,"
Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, 2/28,
https://www.wagingpeace.org/democracy-hypocrisy-first-use/

Two of these myths are widely subscribed to by both liberals and
conservatives. The two [[myths]{.mark} purport to explain why some
countries can be trusted with nuclear weapons and some can never
be]{.underline}, and lead many to believe that nuclear weapons protect a
liberal democratic international order. [They]{.underline} also [[lead
many to take]{.mark} it [for granted]{.mark} [that]{.mark}]{.underline}
the president of [[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[can condemn]{.underline}]{.mark}
North [[Korea for testing a missile the]{.mark} very [same week]{.mark}
that [the US tests a]{.mark} ballistic [missile]{.mark}]{.underline},
and no one says, "Wait a minute, **[[isn't that
hypocritical?]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[Isn't there a double standard
there?"]{.underline}**

The first myth is that the US is a democracy in the fullest sense of the
word, and that nuclear weapons protect this democracy. When I say to my
students, "You know the US is not really a democracy, right?" they say
"You're crazy, Professor." They won't even argue about it, because to
them it's obvious the US is a democracy.

What is a democracy? The Oxford English Dictionary definition is it's
"government by the people; that form of government in which the
sovereign power resides in the people as a whole and is exercised either
directly by them as in small republics of antiquity or by officers
elected by them."

The US Constitution states that "Congress shall have power to declare
war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning
captures on land or water." The OED definition and the US Constitution
make clear that in a democracy, one autocratic figure should not have
sole authority to declare war. But in reality, as President Nixon
famously told a group of congressmen, "I can go in my office and pick up
a telephone, and in 25 minutes, millions of people will be dead." A
president of the United States made that boast---there is nothing less
democratic. As Elaine Scarry says, "A momentous shift in the nature of
government, the home population's power of and responsibility for
self-defense, has been lifted away from them and condensed into the head
of government."

[The]{.underline} second [myth is that the US is a]{.underline} modern
[country with the maturity and rationality to possess nuclear weapons,
unlike developing countries]{.underline}, and unlike countries in the
Global South. [I call this]{.underline} way of looking at the world
[[nuclear orientalism]{.mark}. It [characterizes countries in Asia,
Africa, Latin America as]{.mark} too infantile, too immature, and [too
irresponsible to be trusted]{.mark}]{.underline} with nuclear weapons.

[Nuclear orientalists]{.underline}---that is to say, **[most of
us]{.underline}**---[see developing countries as lacking the democratic
self-control required of nuclear powers. They present developing
countries as seeking nuclear weapons for vanity or to gain attention and
not for legitimate reasons]{.underline} of self-defense. And [they
believe]{.underline} that [fanatics are more likely to
control]{.underline} nuclear [weapons in developing countries,
especially Muslim countries, than in developed ones.]{.underline}

The frame of nuclear orientalism takes it for granted that Muslim
leaders could destroy the world in a fit of fanaticism. Here are some
examples, deliberately chosen from both the left and the right. At the
Livermore Lab, where I did my fieldwork, I was given a pamphlet that
stated, "Smaller nations with deep-seated grievances against each other
may lack the restraint that was exercised by the US and the USSR." Here
is Kenneth Adelman, who was an official in the Reagan Administration:
"The real danger comes from some miserable Third World country which
decides to use these weapons either out of desperation or incivility."

These comments take it as given that Third World countries are not like
us. In that same spirit here is a very recent example from Forbes
magazine: "Nuclear weapons are one of those sovereign rights that should
not be granted to autocratic leaders. Because of this adherence to core
values, global public opinion trusts Western democracies to have nuclear
weapons and to use them in a defensive manner." By contrast, the author
of the Forbes article points out that "North Korea's sovereignty inheres
in just one man." But remember Richard Nixon's boast that he could
exercise a similarly autocratic sovereignty.

Many of these discussions assume that public opinion has a greater force
in the West than in developing countries. For example, Bill Potter, a
liberal arms control analyst at the James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies, has written, "Adverse domestic opinion may
also serve as a constraint on the acquisition of nuclear weapons by some
nations. Japan, West Germany, Sweden, and Canada are examples of
democracies where public opposition could have a decided effect on
nuclear weapons decisions. ... The fear of adverse public opinion, on
the other hand, might be expected to be marginal for many developing
nations without a strong democratic tradition."

What I find fascinating about an expert on nuclear weapons and nuclear
history writing this is that Britain, France, and the United States all
made the decision to acquire nuclear weapons with absolutely no
democratic debate. There was no debate in the public sphere, nor in
those countries' legislatures. These decisions were not subject to
democratic decision making, yet even highly informed people continue to
take it, falsely, as obvious that they were and are.

And consider US media coverage of India's and Pakistan's nuclear tests
in 1998. Michael Krepon, the liberal cofounder of the Stimson Center,
said that India's tests "weren't done for security purposes," despite
the fact that India has a nuclear-armed China on its border. Instead, he
said, India tested nuclear weapons "for reasons of domestic politics and
national pride. ... We have street demonstrations to protest nuclear
weapons. They have them to celebrate them." In other words, the US is
serious, India is frivolous.

More recently, the New York Times opined, using language usually
reserved for children: "Maybe North Korea is just jealous of all the
attention that Iran has been getting as a result of Tehran's recent
nuclear bad behavior and craves a spotlight of its own." Nor is the New
York Times alone in this view: "Whenever the North Koreans act up, one
has to assume in part at least that they are trying to get the world's
attention." That's from Robert Einhorn, who was special advisor on
nonproliferation and arms control to the secretary of state from 2009 to
2013. Cartoons often make these assumptions even more visceral; many
portray Kim Jong-un as a child who wants attention and can't be trusted
with nuclear weapons.

Today, our mental architecture is being destabilized because [[the
US]{.mark} has a [president]{.mark} who [disturbingly resembles the most
cartoonish]{.mark} versions of [Kim]{.mark} Jong-un;
[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} also [**[seems like a child]{.underline}**
[who]{.underline}]{.mark} [wants attention and [**can't be trusted**.
The dichotomy between a responsible]{.mark}, mature, rational,
democratic **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and]{.mark} autocratic, impulsive,
childish, [irresponsible]{.mark} North [Korea, Pakistan, Iran, or India
is breaking down]{.mark}.]{.underline} Since President
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} won the election, students in my classes
have begun to say things that they would not have said before. They are
starting to ask, "He couldn't just use the weapons on his own, right?
There must be some way of constraining him?" I have to tell them that,
in theory at least, he [[can use]{.mark} the [weapons **on his
own**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Students who]{.underline} used to [reject]{.underline} out of hand my
[arguments about nuclear orientalism are now giving them a second look
in the era of [Trump]{.mark}, who made [comments]{.mark}
like]{.underline} this one in a speech to the United Nations: "The
United States has great strength and patience but if it is forced to
defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally
destroy North Korea. [Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself."
This [is an **open boast**]{.mark} from the president of the United
States that [he is considering]{.mark} committing
[genocide]{.mark}.]{.underline}

If we want to move toward a better, safer world, [[we have
to]{.underline}]{.mark} start to [[realize]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[Americans have no monopoly on]{.mark} maturity and
[rationality]{.mark}. We should look in the mirror of Donald Trump and
ask ourselves what it says about the United States that it was capable
of electing such a human being as president. We should question our own
smugness]{.underline} about how safe nuclear weapons are in our leader's
hands. [Given that [any country can end up with an irrational,
autocratic leader]{.mark} at some point, [the **only** world
safe]{.mark} from nuclear war [is a world where nuclear weapons have
been abolished.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Public opinion pollsters often ask, [["Is America moving in the right

to [nuclear policy, the Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} administration's
Nuclear Posture Review ([[NPR]{.underline})
**[decidedly]{.underline}**]{.mark} [puts the country on]{.underline}
**[the wrong track]{.underline}** in that it fails to lower the risk
that nuclear weapons will be used, to increase strategic stability, to
reduce the chances of miscalculation, and to ensure our national
security at reasonable cost.

Increasing Reliance on Nuclear Weapons

Four [successive]{.underline} Republican and Democratic
[administrations]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War [had sought
to reduce the role and number of nuclear weapons]{.underline} in U.S.
national security strategy. [[This NPR makes a **dangerous**]{.mark}
**and unjustified**]{.underline} [[U-turn by expanding the role of
nuclear weapons]{.mark} and the purposes for which they could be used,
**[making a case for their enduring contribution to]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [failing to uphold reduced reliance as
a desired goal, and elevating the contribution of U.S. forward-based
nuclear weapons]{.underline} in Europe [to the security of
NATO.]{.underline}

**[[Abdicating U.S]{.mark}. Global [Leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[In contrast to the 2010 NPR, [the 2018 review puts]{.mark} **almost
[exclusive emphasis]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on nuclear weapons]{.mark}
and military means [and]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[insufficiently
promotes]{.mark} [diplomacy]{.mark} and nonmilitary
instruments]{.underline}** [of national power to address national
security threats. [It]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[overstates]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the degradation in [the
threat]{.mark} environment]{.underline} since 2010 [[and]{.underline}
**[fails to explain]{.underline}** [why more]{.underline}]{.mark} [types
of and [uses for nuclear weapons is]{.mark}]{.underline} an
[[effective]{.underline}]{.mark} means to address threats that have
legitimately worsened. These include increased Russian assertiveness,
the growing North Korean threat, Chinese actions in South China Sea, and
the spread of new technologies, including cyberabilities.

The new NPR report fails to make a convincing case that the United
States is slipping from a position of nuclear parity with Russia and
facing a regional deterrence gap necessitating new nuclear capabilities,
or that the United States is newly threatened by China's still
significantly smaller nuclear arsenal. It fails to explain why all other
nuclear-armed countries except Russia will not be deterred by a nuclear
force that is primarily sized and postured to deter Russia, whose
arsenal is orders of magnitude larger than any other potential
adversary, including China. It undersells what the 2010 NPR report
termed the "unrivaled conventional capabilities" of the United
States---capabilities that are still unrivaled and contribute immensely
to deterrence and the defense of our nation, allies, and partners.

[Against that backdrop, [the]{.mark} 2018 [NPR]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[heralds a retreat from]{.mark} U.S. global
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[on]{.mark} nuclear
[nonprolif]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [and arms control. Although it
reaffirms]{.underline} commitment to [the NPT and supports
the]{.underline} **[I]{.underline}**nternational
**[A]{.underline}**tomic **[E]{.underline}**nergy
**[A]{.underline}**gency and mechanisms to constrain, deny, and sanction
proliferators, [[it **falls short**]{.underline} [in advancing
a]{.underline}]{.mark} [positive [strategy]{.mark} for addressing
prolif]{.underline}eration threats [through diplomacy and]{.underline}
pursuing steps related to the [disarmament]{.underline} pillar of the
NPT. [This is a **stark contrast**]{.underline} [with the 2010 NPR,
which envisioned a]{.underline} **[comprehensive approach]{.underline}**
[to reducing nuclear dangers and]{.underline} pursuing [the long-term
goal of a world without nuclear weapons]{.underline}, including through
practical steps of further nuclear reductions with Russia, pursuit of a
fissile material cutoff treaty, and ratification and entry into force of
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).

[[The]{.mark} new [NPR]{.mark}]{.underline} report [[is]{.underline}
**[silent on]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[multilateral nuclear [arms
control]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [other than to **reject CTBT
ratification**]{.underline}]{.mark} while upholding, with caveats, the
testing moratorium.8 [[On]{.mark} bilateral arms control with [Russia,
it notes]{.mark}]{.underline} fairly that [[the current environment
makes]{.mark} bilateral [progress **extremely
challenging**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [but offers]{.underline} **[no
proposals]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to improve the
environment]{.underline}**, [[failing]{.mark} even [to endorse]{.mark} a
five-year [extension of]{.mark}]{.underline} the New Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty ([[New START]{.underline}]{.mark}).

The latter is an easy call: As long as Russia is complying with New
START, it is strongly in the U.S. interest to extend the treaty's limits
and most importantly its robust and intrusive verification regime,
providing essential long-term predictability and insight into each
other's strategic nuclear forces. Russia's violation of and mutual
recriminations over the INF Treaty make this especially important.
Extension is not a favor to Russia; it would be a mutually beneficial
and stabilizing step as the United States and Russia seek to address
bilateral problems and rebuild trust.

The [[policies]{.mark} in the NPR [will **further erode strategic
stability**]{.mark}, notwithstanding the report's stated desire for
stable relations with Russia and China]{.underline}. [[While calling
for]{.mark} nuclear [dialogue]{.mark} and transparency with China, [it
offers **no strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline} [for what do to about the
erosion of strategic stability with Russia [other than]{.mark} to **[rev
up the]{.mark} engine for an [arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [It is
**devoid**]{.underline} [of any consideration of
how]{.underline}]{.mark} the [nuclear [policies]{.mark} and forces [it
prescribes will be perceived]{.mark}]{.underline} by other countries,
particularly Russia and China; how they might react and thus affect
strategic stability; and how U.S. national security will be affected if
they and other countries adopt similar policies and postures.

[The]{.underline} **[overarching problems]{.underline}** [with the
nonprolif]{.underline}eration [and arms control element]{.underline} of
the NPR [are what it portends for U.S. policy and **how it will be
received internationally**]{.underline}. [Substantively, [it offers **no
strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline} and few proposals
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} reducing nuclear dangers, encouraging nuclear
reductions, peacefully [[advancing]{.mark}
nonprolif]{.underline}eration, [and sustaining international adherence
to]{.underline} and support for [[the NPT]{.underline}]{.mark} regime.
[[It **fails to acknowledge**]{.mark} the positive contribution of
[diplomacy in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}
nuclear agreement [[and]{.mark} makes **no mention**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [the role diplomacy could play in]{.underline}
addressing the North [[Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}n nuclear threat.
[[It]{.underline} **[fails to reaffirm]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [in
contrast to the 2010 NPR, that it is in the interest of all nations to
extend forever the now 73-year record of nuclear
[non-use.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The new nuclear weapons prohibition treaty, criticized in the NPR, is
largely an outgrowth of the frustration and disappointment that has
grown among non-nuclear-weapon states with the pace of progress by the
United States, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom on their
NPT Article VI disarmament commitment.9 [[With the international
community]{.underline}]{.mark} **[increasingly
[polarized]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [this NPR **adds fuel to the
fire**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.underline} **[offers
little]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to work with [for allies]{.mark} and

[[Lawmakers]{.mark} and]{.underline} President [Trump [are
laying]{.mark} the [groundwork for **a new
showdown**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[over Saudi Arabia]{.underline},
**[underscoring deep frustrations]{.underline}**]{.mark} [on Capitol
Hill.]{.underline}

[[With Trump expected to veto]{.underline} [resolutions
blocking]{.underline}]{.mark} [his arms [sales]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia,
[lawmakers are]{.mark} **already [eyeing additional]{.mark} avenues to
[push back]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the U.S.-Saudi relationship, which
has soured in Congress [over the Yemen civil war and]{.underline} the
[death of]{.underline} Washington Post contributor Jamal
[Khashoggi]{.underline}.

Members in [**[both chambers]{.underline}** [are moving forward
with]{.underline}]{.mark} **[separate [bills]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[that]{.mark} would **[hem in Trump]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or penalize
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}.

The House Foreign Affairs Committee advanced a bill Wednesday that would
require the director of national intelligence to determine who is
responsible for Khashoggi's death and would impose visa restrictions on
those people.

Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) said he expects that bill to
come to the floor "shortly" after the July Fourth recess.

"The horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi demands accountability and
justice," Engel said during the committee's consideration of the bill.
"After the astounding evidence we've seen, it can't just be business as
usual. And since the administration is dragging its feet on taking any
meaningful action, Congress must step forward."

The [action in the committee comes as **[several]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[Saudi]{.mark}-related [amendments have been filed for]{.mark} the
House's version of [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[N]{.underline}**]{.mark}ational **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**uthorization **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ct,

the]{.mark} [A]{.mark}rms [E]{.mark}xport [C]{.mark}ontrol [A]{.mark}ct
[and end U.S.]{.mark} military [support]{.mark} for the Saudi coalition
in Yemen**, among others]{.underline}.

[[The House will take up the]{.mark} mammoth defense
[bill]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[next month]{.underline}**]{.mark}, though
only a fraction of the 600-plus amendments typically get a vote.

[The [Senate Foreign Relations]{.mark} Committee]{.underline}
[**[also]{.underline}** [approved legislation]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[this week]{.underline}** [that would **restrict Trump's ability to
use an "emergency" provision**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of
the]{.underline} **[A]{.underline}**]{.mark}rms
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**xport **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ontrol
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ct to bypass a requirement that the
administration give Congress a 30-day notification before an arms sale.

[Several **[Republicans]{.mark}**]{.underline} have [[raised concerns
about]{.mark} how [the admin]{.mark}istration used the emergency
provision]{.underline}, **[[bolstering]{.mark} its [chances of]{.mark}
picking up additional [GOP support]{.mark}]{.underline}** [outside of
the committee]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} **[[bipartisan legislation]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[spearheaded by]{.underline} Sen. Bob [Menendez]{.underline} (D-N.J.),
[[comes after Trump **sparked fierce backlash**]{.underline} [by
leapfrogging Congress]{.underline} ]{.mark}[on a deal [to sell arms
t]{.mark}o Saudi Arabia]{.underline} **[[despite]{.mark} bipartisan
[opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}** on Capitol Hill. The administration
argued that Iran's actions in the region required enacting the emergency
language on the Arms Export Control Act and forcing through the sale.

[[Menendez]{.mark} said]{.underline} that he hasn't gotten a commitment
for a floor vote on his legislation but that [he
"[is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[going to push]{.mark} for
it."]{.underline}**

**[The [push]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[for]{.underline} **[additional
action]{.underline}** [comes as the House still needs to vote
on]{.underline}]{.mark} [resolutions **[blocking Trump's]{.mark} arms
sales**]{.underline} [to Saudi Arabia, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[A]{.underline}**rab
**[E]{.underline}**mirates [and Jordan. The [**22** arms
sales]{.mark}]{.underline}, estimated to be worth more than \$8 billion,
[include]{.underline} precision-guided [bombs]{.underline}, Patriot
[missiles]{.underline}, mortar [rounds]{.underline},
[drones]{.underline}, fighter [jet parts and]{.underline} other
[military support.]{.underline}

[[Engel]{.underline}]{.mark} said he does not have a specific timeline
for considering the arms sales resolutions but **[[vowed]{.mark} [to
take them up]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in]{.mark} his
[committee]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[["We're]{.underline} [**absolutely going to pursue it,"** he
said]{.underline}]{.mark}[. "We've **already** had]{.underline} some
classified [briefings. And it's too important]{.underline} an issue
[because [it has repercussions]{.mark}]{.underline} **[not only for
Saudi Arabia now]{.underline}**, [but [for **lots of
countries**]{.mark}, including Saudi Arabia, down the
road."]{.underline}

Asked if there is a rush to pass the resolutions before the first
weapons are delivered, Engel would not comment on the timeline of the
deliveries, citing classified information. But [in general, [he
said,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**["the deadline is
now.]{.underline}**]{.mark} [We have to move on these things
**now."**]{.underline}

[A spokesperson for]{.underline} House Majority Leader Steny
[[Hoyer]{.underline}]{.mark} (D-Md.) [[told The
Hill]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[they would]{.mark} plan to [bring
the]{.mark} Senate-passed [resolutions to the floor]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[in July.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

[[Trump is expected to veto the resolutions]{.underline}]{.mark} of
disapproval; [the Senate will not have the votes to
override]{.underline} the veto after initially passing the resolutions
blocking the sale with 51 and 53 votes, respectively.

**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the push for **[additional
legislation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is the latest sign of]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[growing frustration]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on
Capitol Hill about the U.S.-Saudi relationship]{.underline}. The Senate
passed a resolution last year that named Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman as responsible for Khashoggi's death. The resolution marked a
significant break with Trump --- he has refused to name the crown prince
as responsible --- but stalled in the then-GOP-controlled House.

Congress passed a separate resolution earlier this year forcing Trump to
remove troops in or affecting Yemen unless they were fighting al Qaeda;
Trump vetoed the resolution.

But unlike the Yemen resolution or the move to block Trump's arms sales,
any additional [legislation will need 60 votes]{.underline} in the
Senate [and]{.underline} Majority Leader Mitch [McConnell's]{.underline}
(R-Ky.) [support]{.underline} to get a floor vote, throwing a curveball
into the chances of getting another bill to Trump's desk.

Sen. Lindsey [[Graham]{.underline}]{.mark} (R-S.C.), a member of the
Foreign Relations Committee, said he [[hoped the Senate will]{.mark} be
able to [find common ground]{.mark}]{.underline}, either [[by getting a
bill Trump would back or build]{.mark}ing enough [support to]{.mark}
successfully [override]{.mark} a veto]{.underline}, which would be the
first of the Trump administration.

"You get a bill that would get a veto override, that's one way to do
it," [[he said,]{.underline}]{.mark} "another would be to get a bill
that he'll sign, so **[[we'll keep plugging]{.mark}
away."]{.underline}**

[[The admin]{.mark}istration's [goal in streamlining]{.mark} the process

[[sales]{.underline}]{.mark} internationally and bringing in unmanned
aerial systems [[is a **race for global influence**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that goes **well [beyond the marketplace]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[government and industry]{.underline} association [panelists
agreed]{.underline} on Wednesday.

[["Who's going to make the rules]{.underline} **[for the next 50
years"]{.underline}** [for international behavior]{.underline}]{.mark},
Dak [[Hardwick]{.underline}]{.mark}, assistant vice president for
international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association,
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Hardwick]{.mark} and others specially [cited]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[growing]{.underline}** [Chinese interest in]{.underline}]{.mark}
overseas [military [sales and Russia's success]{.mark} of selling air
missile defense systems]{.underline} to Turkey and possibly India.
Neither has the strict rules governing the sales or how these systems
would be used after purchase the U.S. does.

Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies event in
Washington, Tina Kaidanow, acting assistant secretary of state for
political-military affairs, added the April presidential memo revising
the arms transfer policy and covering unmanned serial systems sales, "is
only the first step \[to\] support and grow our defense industrial
base." She added that every sale, still will be reviewed for compliance
with United States law concerning human rights and how each sale could
affect arms proliferation.

The government expects to meet industry requests to set milestones and
timelines so they can plan and budget for potential sales domestically
and to allies and partners, Laura Cressey, deputy director for regional
security and arms transfers at the State Department said. She added new
financing options for foreign partners would be available as an
incentive to buy American.

"We have a bit of a balancing act here," she said. For example, the
balancing act includes mitigating the risk to the American warfighter
five years down the road by selling this specific system with its unique
technology to "Y" country.

Case-by-case also means that approval is not guaranteed based upon past
performance by a contractor or behavior by a nation, she and several
panelists said.

In some parts of the State Department, it also means trying to "do more
with less" to meet accelerated timelines as staffing has been left
vacant or cut, she added.

To Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association, this
raised "a great deal of concern" because "priorities are not being
weighted" in reaching those decisions. He added arms sales should not be
considered "a trade commodity; these are weapons," not to be rushed the
system.

[[Arms sales "are]{.underline} **[fundamentally]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[a [political]{.mark} act,"]{.underline}** Melissa

to fit in with]{.underline} the President Donald [Trump's national

standard as a guide but does not spell out how for the various federal
agencies involved in arms transfers.

**[A]{.underline}**gency, [certified]{.underline} again last week that
[Iran remains in compliance]{.underline} with the terms.

Another main Trump objection, apart from verifiability, was that it
covered only nuclear matters and did not constrain Iran's regional
meddling or support for terrorists. True, but successful arms control
seldom works that way. With the Soviet Union, for example, the United
States made narrowly framed nuclear arms limitation agreements and dealt
--- successfully, it turned out --- with other aspects of Soviet
security and human-rights behavior through separate agreements. For
example, the 1975 Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe
(CSCE, now OSCE) isolated the USSR on many of these issues. Had we
insisted on rolling everything together, there would probably not have
been Strategic Arms limitation accords with Moscow.

With North Korea, [[the]{.mark} Trump-[Kim summit]{.mark}]{.underline}
in June [[was]{.underline} **[underprepared]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[and overhyped]{.underline}**, [[leaving everyone]{.underline}
**[confused]{.underline}**]{.mark} [about where things stand and what
comes next.]{.underline} The [North [Koreans have not come]{.mark} forth
[with]{.mark} the [required]{.mark}]{.underline} declaration of their
program's [[details or taken]{.underline} **[any
steps]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to]{.underline}ward
[denuclearization]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the initiative has passed to
South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, who is sending a delegation this week
to Pyongyang to prepare for the third summit he will hold with his
northern counterpart later this month.

Both [the South and North favor a step-by-step approach in which the
North gradually earns concessions]{.underline} on trade, aid and
diplomatic recognition in return [for]{.underline} North Korean steps on
[disarm]{.underline}ament. I know from my own talks with South Korean
leaders that they have thought about and planned for this in detail.
[With this strategy, however, everyone has to be on guard against the
North pocketing concessions]{.underline} but holding out on their end of
the bargain --- a tactic they have perfected over years.

The South may also share the North's desire for a formal declaration of
the end of the Korean War of 1950--53, which, if agreed prematurely,
would remove much of the rationale for maintaining a U.S. presence in
South Korea.

Meanwhile, [U.S. [talks with Russia]{.mark} about resuming nuclear arms
talks [are]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[regrettably]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[caboose]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[on this
train]{.underline}**. [Regrettable because the most effective way to set
precedent for nuclear policy with minor powers]{.underline} like Iran
and North Korea [is through the example of successful]{.underline}
nuclear [limitations]{.underline} between the two powers that possess
the vast majority of the world's nuclear weapons.

The most recent U.S.-Russian Strategic Arms accord ([[New
START]{.underline}]{.mark}) came into force in 2011 and [[is set to
expire]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2021. [[The easiest way to keep
it]{.underline}]{.mark} alive [[is]{.mark} for]{.underline} the
[Russia]{.underline}n [and U.S]{.underline}. presidents
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} invoke a clause that [[automatically
extend]{.underline}]{.mark}s [the accord]{.underline} for five years.
Some reports indicate that Russian President [[Putin is
willing]{.underline}]{.mark} to do this, [**[but]{.underline}**
[we]{.underline}]{.mark} [still [have **no idea**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[of the extent]{.mark} to which [this was discussed]{.mark} or agreed
upon [by Trump]{.mark} and Putin]{.underline} in July. National Security
Advisor John Bolton has just completed talks with Russian counterparts
and says the U.S. may decide among three options: renewing the New START
agreement, renegotiating it or falling back to a shorter, simpler
agreement from the George W. Bush administration (this agreement had no
monitoring or verification provision for the arms limits).

[[Given]{.mark} the administration's]{.underline} [**[instinctive
dislike]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [anything]{.underline}
President [[Obama]{.mark} did, [the **strong
temptation**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[will be]{.mark} to try
[renegotiating]{.mark}]{.underline} the 2011 agreement. [It would be
smarter]{.underline}, though, [to just renew]{.underline} the agreement
rather than adding this to the overflowing plate of problems with North
Korea and Iran. [Besides]{.underline}, as one arms control specialist
has warned, [[failure to extend]{.mark} [New START would leave
the]{.mark} "world's two [largest]{.mark} nuclear
[arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[with no]{.mark} legally binding
[limits for the first time since]{.mark} 19[72."]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[It's hard to think of a **worse example**]{.underline}]{.mark} [for
North Korea, Iran and other aspiring nuclear powers]{.underline}.

[The **kindest thing** to say about all of this is that U.S.
proliferation [policy is]{.mark} **stalled**]{.underline}. [Less kind
would be to call it [a **muddle**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Pulling out
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} agreement
**[[alienated]{.mark} allies and other
[signatories]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and gave some]{.mark} of them,
China and Russia]{.underline}, **[[added leverage]{.mark} and propaganda
points]{.underline}**. The [North [Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}n situation
[[leaves Asians]{.mark} **confused and [worried]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and **catapults our South Korean partners**]{.underline}, [who may not
fully share our objectives]{.underline}, [into the driver's
seat]{.underline} --- **[perhaps ceding more responsibility to them than
they even want]{.underline}**. [And [hesitation with Russia]{.mark} on
renewing]{.underline} [New START]{.underline} **[[passes on an easy
win]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the most dangerous area of bilateral
competition.

#### Nuclear leadership [fails]{.underline} -- U.S. won't exercise it, agency competition, and it doesn't cause other states to change behavior 

**Cleary 12** (Richard Cleary 12, Research Assistant at the American
Enterprise Institute, 8/13/12, "Persuading Countries to Forgo Nuclear
Fuel-Making: What History Suggests,"
[http://npolicy.org/article.php?aid=
1192&tid=30](http://npolicy.org/article.php?aid=%201192&tid=30))

In recent years, [there has been a resurgence of proposals designed to
limit the spread of nuclear fuel-making facilities]{.underline}, with
the understanding that ostensibly peaceful technology can allow for the
production of the fissile material required for a nuclear weapon. With
U.S. proposals ranging from the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP)
to a revamped, "Gold Standard" bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement,
a wider array of tools has been put at the disposal of American policy
makers. Prominent members of the international community have become
agitated about the prospect of the proliferation of fuel-making
technology as well, with numerous proposals of fuel assurances put
forward by such disparate figures as Vladimir Putin and Mohamed
ElBaradei. [But [renewed enthusiasm for
nonprolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline} [**[begs questions]{.underline}**
[about]{.underline}]{.mark} [how novel [the instruments proposed]{.mark}
are, [and]{.mark}]{.underline}, moreover, [[how effective they
are]{.mark} likely to be]{.underline}, [particularly for]{.underline}
the country historically at the head of nonproliferation efforts, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [A review of [this historical
record suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[optimism about the U.S.
ability to dissuade countries]{.mark} from this path [is
misplaced]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

This essay considers supply side proposals of fuel assurance,
multilateral fuel-making, as well as specific interventions on both the
supply and demand sides, consulting particular cases in Iran
(1974-1978), West Germany-Brazil (1975-1977), South Korea (1974-1976)
and Pakistan (1972-1980) to draw lessons about the effectiveness of U.S.
practices under differing circumstances. [[The
record]{.underline}]{.mark} these cases give [[is mixed, due to]{.mark}
two principal causes.]{.underline} The [first is the]{.underline}
**[[failure of the U.S. to consistently prioritize
nonprolif]{.mark}eration [efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[given]{.mark}
Washington's]{.underline} [global and [competing
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}, interests [that tend to be embraced
by]{.underline} [different factions in the federal government
apparatus]{.underline} but whose ultimate arbiter is the president
(along with his close advisors). The [[second is the tendency of
decisions about nuclear fuel-making]{.mark} by the state in question [to
be influenced]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[more by fundamental
trends]{.underline}**]{.mark} or factors **[[than diplomatic maneuvering
from Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}**; diplomacy is most effective when
it has the political, economic and military backing to implicate these
issues. [The most important factor in U.S. efforts has tended to be the
bilateral relationship between Washington and the country]{.underline}
at hand. [Decision-makers who consider their country's relationship with
the U.S. to be strategically vital]{.underline}---and believe that
fuel-making would threaten this relationship---[are most likely to
forgo]{.underline} enrichment and reprocessing ([ENR]{.underline})
technology. [This calculus can be informed by a range of dynamics, some
beyond U.S. control]{.underline}, such as security concerns, issues of
prestige, and commercial and industrial interests. Domestic politics and
public opinion, both in the United States and in the country considering
fuel-making, can be influential.

The bad news: [[Earth]{.mark}\'s climate]{.underline} change problem
[just **[passed]{.mark} a point of [no return]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Atmospheric [[carbon]{.underline}]{.mark} levels have [[passed

\"**[[ever]{.mark} again]{.underline}** for the indefinite future.\"
[The good news?]{.underline} Oh, wait, **[no]{.underline}**. Sorry.
**[[We\'re]{.mark} pretty [screwed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We already
knew it was bad. After all, [in the last 20 years, humanity
destroyed]{.underline} 1.27 million square miles---**[10
percent]{.underline}**---[of]{.underline} the Earth\'s [wilderness.
[Climate]{.mark} change]{.underline} has \"[[devastated]{.underline}\"
**[93 percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
[[Great Barrier]{.mark} Reef]{.underline}. The world\'s so screwed that
genius Stephen [[Hawking]{.underline}]{.mark} recently
[[claimed]{.underline}]{.mark} that \"the [human race]{.underline}
**[[has no future]{.underline}]{.mark}** [if it doesn\'t go to
space]{.underline}.\" But [now we]{.underline} **[really, really
know]{.underline}** [we\'re in trouble]{.underline}. Scientist Ralph
[Keeling]{.underline}, who\'s in charge of the Scripps Institute for
Oceanography\'s carbon dioxide monitoring program, [wrote]{.underline}
in a blog that \"[it]{.underline} already [seems safe to
conclude]{.underline} that **[we won't]{.underline}** be
[see]{.underline}ing a monthly value [below 400 ppm]{.underline} this
year---or **[ever again]{.underline}** for the indefinite future.\"
Similarly, [NASA\'s **chief climate scientist**]{.underline} Gavin
[Schmidt told Climate Central]{.underline}, "In my opinion, [we won't
**ever**]{.underline} [see]{.underline} a month [below]{.underline} 400
ppm." Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is the \"primary greenhouse gas that is
contributing to recent climate change,\" according to the Environmental
Protection Agency. [[NASA says]{.underline}]{.mark} that the planet\'s
average surface [[temperature]{.mark} has [warmed]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[1.8 degrees]{.underline}**]{.mark} Fahrenheit since the Industrial
Revolution, [because of \"increased]{.underline} carbon dioxide and
other human-made [emissions]{.underline} into the atmosphere.\" [[This

of it, one-fourth of the Earth\'s species could be extinct by 2050. It
also screws up food webs, as polar bears are finding out the hard way.
Millions and millions of people will have to relocate due to rising sea
levels, with scientists estimating that over 13 million Americans might
have to move by 2100. While 400 ppm is more of a symbolic point than an
actual tipping point (for example, there\'s not a huge difference
between 395 ppm and 405 ppm), the [findings]{.underline} at the Mauna
Loa Observatory in Hawaii [are troubling because September is
typically]{.underline} the **[lowest point]{.underline}** of the year
for atmospheric carbon dioxide. Keeling explained, \"[[By November, we
will]{.mark} be marching]{.underline} up the rising half of the cycle,
pushing [towards]{.underline} new highs and perhaps even
**[[break]{.mark}ing the [410 ppm]{.mark} barrier]{.underline}**.\" In
2012, the Arctic passed the 400 ppm mark---the first region to do so. In
recent years, Antarctica was the only carbon dioxide monitoring station
that hadn\'t reached a reading of 400 ppm, but they passed that mark in
June---for the first time in millions of years. [The silver

#### But, no impact

**Lehr 19 --** Jay Lehr, Ph.D. in Groundwater Hydrology from the
University of Arizona, and Tom Harris, Executive Director of the
International Climate Science Coalition, "Global Warming Myth Debunked:
Humans Have Minimal Impact on Atmosphere's Carbon Dioxide and Climate",
Western Journal, 2-14,
<https://www.westernjournal.com/global-warming-myth-debunked-humans-minimal-impact-atmospheres-carbon-dioxide-climate/>
\[language modified\]

Global [warming activists argue carbon-dioxide emissions are destroying
the planet, but the [climate impacts]{.mark} of carbon dioxide [are
**minimal, at worst**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Activists would also have
you believe fossil-fuel emissions have driven carbon-dioxide
concentrations to their highest levels in history. The Obama-era
Environmental Protection Agency went so far as to classify carbon
dioxide as a toxic pollutant, and it established a radical goal of
closing all of America's coal-fired power plants.

[Claims of unprecedented]{.underline} carbon-dioxide [levels ignore most
of Earth's 4.6-billion-year history. Relative to Earth's entire record,
carbon-dioxide [levels are at **historic**]{.mark}**ally [low]{.mark}**
levels; they only appear high when compared to the dangerously low
levels of carbon dioxide that occurred in Earth's very recent history.
The geologic record reveals [carbon]{.mark} dioxide [has **almost
always** been in]{.mark} Earths' atmosphere in much [greater
concentrations]{.mark} than it is today. For example, [600 million years
ago]{.mark}, when history's greatest birth of new animal species
occurred]{.underline}, atmospheric carbon-dioxide [concentrations
exceeded 6,500]{.underline} parts per million [(ppm) --- an amount
that's [**17 times** greater]{.mark} than it is today]{.underline}.

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is currently only 410 parts per million. That
means only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere is carbon dioxide (compared to
0.03 percent one century ago). Only one molecule in 2,500 is carbon
dioxide. Such levels certainly do not pose a health risk, as
carbon-dioxide levels in our naval submarines, which stay submerged for
months at a time, contain an average carbon-dioxide concentration of
5,000 ppm.

The geologic record is important because it reveals relationships
between carbon-dioxide levels, climate, and life on Earth. [Over
billions of years, the [geologic record shows]{.mark} there is
**[no]{.mark} long-term [correlation]{.mark}** [between]{.mark}
atmospheric [carbon]{.mark}-dioxide levels [and]{.mark} Earth's
[climate. There are periods]{.mark} in Earth's history [when]{.mark}
carbon dioxide [concentrations were **many times** higher]{.mark} than
they are today, [yet temperatures]{.mark} were identical to, or **even
[colder]{.mark}** than, modern times. [The claim]{.mark} that
fossil-fuel [emissions control]{.mark} atmospheric
[carbon]{.mark}-dioxide concentrations [is]{.mark} also [**invalid**,
as]{.mark} atmospheric [concentrations]{.mark} have [gone up]{.mark} and
down in the geological record, [**even without** human
influence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The absurdity of climate alarmism claims gets even stranger when you
consider there are 7.5 billion people on our planet who, together,
exhale 2.7 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year, which is almost 10
percent of total fossil-fuel emissions every year. However, we are but a
single species. Combined, people and all domesticated animals contribute
10 billion tons.

Further, [9 percent of carbon-dioxide emissions from all living things
arise not from animals, but from anaerobic bacteria and
fungi]{.underline}. These organisms metabolize dead plant and animal
matter in soil via decay processes that recycle carbon dioxide back into
the atmosphere. The grand total produced by all living things is
estimated to be 440 billion tons per year, or 13 times the amount of
carbon dioxide currently being produced by fossil-fuel emissions.
[[Fossil-fuel]{.mark} emissions [are **less than 10 percent** of]{.mark}
biological [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Are you laughing yet?

[Every [apocalyptic pronouncement]{.mark} you hear or read [is
**\[totally wrong\]**]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~nothing short of
insanity~~. Their primary goal is not to save plants, humans, or
animals, but rather to use climate "dangers" as a justification for
centralizing power in the hands of a select few.

Jerusalem Institute for Market Studies, "There is Always Time for
Rational Skepticism: Reply to Hall et al," April, ScienceDirect

The uncertainty that encompasses current climate change assessments is
strengthened in light of the studies indicating that [[over]{.mark}
earth\'s [history there have been]{.mark} **distinct [warm
periods]{.mark}** [with tem]{.mark}perature[s **exceeding**]{.mark}
**the [current ones]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Esper et al., 2012, McIntyre
and McKittrick, 2003 and Soon and Baliunas, 2003). [Reviewing the
relevant scientific literature, Khandekar, Murty, and Chittibabu
(2005]{.underline}) [concluded that "in the context of the earth\'s
climate through the last 500 million years, the
[recent]{.mark}]{.underline} (1975--2000) [[increase]{.mark} in the
earth\'s mean temperature [does not appear]{.mark} to be **unusual** or
**[unprecedented]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as claimed by IPCC and many
supporters of the global warming hypothesis]{.underline}" (p. 1568).
Other studies challenged the mainstream climate change narrative,
according to which CO2 levels in the earth\'s atmosphere play a
prominent role in rising temperatures. One notable example is the
research by Shaviv and Veizer (2003), which demonstrates that the
earth\'s temperature correlates well with variations in cosmic ray flux,
rather than changes in atmospheric CO2. These findings and others stir
contentious debates within the climate scientific community, but are
nevertheless largely overlooked by the IPCC, which ignores alternative
explanations for climate change. Regrettably, Hall et al. scornfully
dismiss this evidence, presented in our research note, based on
cherry-picking of a few "non-peer-reviewed" references that were cited,
some vague claims about "misreading" and "selective citing," as well as
other semantic nitpicking. 4. Impacts of climate change [The
[IPCC]{.mark} warns that climate change is likely to have severe
consequences, particularly for poor countries, such as increased hunger,
water shortages, vulnerability to extreme weather events and
debilitating diseases. **However**, these [estimations]{.mark} have been
**heavily criticized** for [fail]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} properly
[account for]{.mark} **substantial improvements in [adaptive
capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., the capability of coping with the
impact of global warming) [that are likely to occur [due to]{.mark}
advances in [**economic development**, **technological change** and
**human capital**]{.mark} over the next century]{.underline} (Goklany,
2007). [Fostering economic growth and technological development, largely
achievable through the use of fossil fuels]{.underline}, [will
strengthen both industrialized and developing countries\' **adaptive
capacity** to deal not just with possible future climate change
consequences, but also with other environmental and public health
problems]{.underline}. [Such policy will **provide greater benefits** at
lower costs than drastic climate change mitigation efforts involving
substantially cutting greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline} (Goklany,
2004 and Goklany, 2012). Furthermore, the analyses of Galiana and Green
(2009) exemplify that in the current state of energy technologies, the
suggested plans for ambitious emission reductions will likely severely
clobber the global economy, especially in view of present economic
conditions. In order to stabilize atmospheric CO2 at accepted levels,
there is a need for enormous advances in efficient energy technology,
which is currently missing (Pielke, Wigley & Green, 2008). In any case,
[**even if** every industrialized nation meets the most ambitious
emissions targets set by the Kyoto Protocol]{.underline}, [such efforts
are likely to have **little effect**]{.underline}, [particularly in the
light of the considerable increases in greenhouse gas emissions by
rising economic superpowers as **China** and **India**, as well as the
**remaining developing world**]{.underline} (Wigley, 1998). Hall et al.
criticized us for choosing "selective citations...that discuss natural
processes potentially affect climate in specific locations and times."
Yet the purpose of referring to such studies was to refute the claims
made by the IPCC and other climate change alarmists to the effect that
recent extreme weather events (e.g., floods, droughts and storms) are
the consequences of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.
Moreover, data shows that despite claims that the number and intensity
of extreme weather has increased, between 1900 and 2010 the average
annual death and death rates from extreme weather events has declined by
93% and 98%, respectively (Goklany, 2009). This is mostly due to
economic and technological factors, such as improved global food
production, increase globalized food trade and better disaster
preparedness. IPCC\'s exaggerated estimations of climate change impacts
were also noted in an op-ed in Financial Times written by climate
economist Richard Tol (2014), a week following his demand that his name
as one of the leading authors be removed from the IPCC\'s AR5 due to its
over alarmist assessments of the impacts of AGW and underestimation of
humanity\'s adaptive capacity. As concluded by Tol, "[[Humans
are]{.mark} a **[tough]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[adaptable]{.mark}**
species]{.underline}. People live on the equator and in the Arctic, in
the desert and in the rainforest. [**[We survived ice ages]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[primitive
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**. [The idea that climate change poses
an existential threat to humankind is]{.underline}
**[laughable]{.underline}**" (2014, para 1).

#### [Long timeframe]{.underline} lets [adaptation]{.underline} solve most of the impact

**Mendelsohn 15 --** Robert Mendelsohn, Edwin Weyerhaeuser Davis
Professor at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies,
"Climate Change Demands We Change. Why Aren\'t We?: An Economic
Perspective", Social Research, Fall2015, Vol. 82 Issue 3, p727

The Benefits of Mitigation Are Modest and Delayed

The popular [literature on climate change]{.underline} is [rife with
claims that climate change is equivalent to an apocalypse. Whether
[climate]{.mark} change leads to an [apocalypse depends on]{.mark} many
factors, including]{.underline} [**[no mitigation]{.underline}**, **[no
adaptation]{.underline}**, **[and unlucky]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[uncertain [events]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Probably the three most
frightening images of climate change are tropical cyclones, floods, and
droughts. Although all these events are likely to occur in a future
climate, they are also an integral component of the current climate. We
already have droughts, floods, and tropical cyclones. The question is,
how will these things change?

According to economic models of fossil fuel consumption, [emissions of
greenhouse gases are expected to double the concentrations of greenhouse
gases]{.underline} from preindustrial levels of 275 part per million
equivalent (ppme) to 550 ppme [by 2040--2050. It will take more than
another 100 years to double concentrations]{.underline} again to 1,100
ppme [in the absence of mitigation. So despite the fact that fossil fuel
consumption is causing a vast quantity of annual emissions]{.underline},
**[[it takes a very long time for]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[concentrations of greenhouse [gases]{.mark} in the atmosphere [to
double]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

According to climate models, a doubling of concentrations is expected to
increase long-run average global temperature by 3°C, with a range
between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees (IPCC 2014a). However, [[there is
a]{.underline} **[long lag]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[between]{.mark} an
[increase in concentrations and]{.mark} the resulting
[temperature]{.mark} increase. One must warm the ocean to warm the
climate. It takes several decades just to warm the upper layers of the
ocean]{.underline}. **[[It takes centuries]{.mark} for the long-run
temperature to be reached.]{.underline}**

The rising temperature is expected to increase the speed of the
hydrological cycle. This will lead to an increase in evaporation, an
increase in precipitation, and an increase in the amount of water in the
atmosphere. Water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas. It represents a
positive feedback mechanism and it contributes significantly to the
prediction of a 3°C increase from doubling greenhouse gases. So the
expectation of increased rainfall is part of the explanation why there
is such a large temperature increase. That does not mean there will be
increased rainfall everywhere. It simply means that average global
rainfall will increase.

The level of CO2 has a direct effect on ecosystems. All plants respond
to higher CO2 levels in a positive fashion. Grasses respond only
slightly to CO2 fertilization, whereas the yields of most crops respond
vigorously. Hundreds of laboratory studies reveal an average increase in
crop yields of 30 percent as CO2 concentrations double (Kimball 2007).

Climate change is expected to melt ice formations. Many glaciers on land
have already shrunk in response to warming, increasing flows in nearby
rivers. The Arctic ice covering the sea in the North Pole is shrinking
rapidly, exposing the Arctic air to the warm sea underneath and causing
the most rapid warming on the planet (IPCC 2014a). Large remaining
glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica might melt over the next thousand
years (IPCC 2014a). The melting of the large ice deposits in Greenland
and Antarctica would cause the oceans to rise to new levels never before
experienced by mankind.

Climate change is expected to have one final impact. In addition to the
mean temperature and precipitation levels rising, there may be a change
in the distribution of weather. Seasonal patterns may change with more
warming in winter than summer. Interannual variance might change.
Diurnal variance may drop as nights become warmer relative to days.
Tropical cyclones may become more powerful. The pattern of global winds
may change, shifting moisture from one place to another. More is known
about global mean changes than these other changes in the distribution.
It is more difficult to study variance and even more difficult to study
extreme events. But it is likely that the distribution of weather events
will change.

What then is the consequence of climate change if greenhouse gases cause
all these changes? What sectors of the economy are vulnerable? What
nonmarket goods and services are at risk?

The literature on impacts has long identified most of the sectors likely
to be affected by climate change (Pearce et al. 1996). The vulnerable
economic sectors include agriculture, coasts, forests, water, and
energy. Important sectors outside the economy that would be affected
include recreation, ecosystem change, human health, and aesthetics. The
controversy about impacts does not concern what will be affected. The
controversy is measuring the magnitude of the impact. Some studies
report damages to mankind equal to 20 percent of total income (Stern
2007). Other **[[studies suggest]{.mark} more [modest effects]{.mark}
[of less than 2 percent of income]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Pearce et al.
1996; Nordhaus 1991). [Yet other studies suggest impacts may be closer
to 0.2 percent of income]{.underline} (Mendelsohn et al. 2006). What
explains estimates that vary by orders of magnitude?

[Although some authors]{.underline} **[speculate about exponentially
increasing damage]{.underline}** (Stern 2007), **[[empirical analysis
suggest]{.underline}]{.mark}**s that **[most [sectors respond]{.mark} to
temperature [in a hill-shaped fashion]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Mendelsohn
and Schlesinger 1999; Tol 2002a). [For each sector, there is an ideal
temperature where the net value of that sector is highest]{.underline}.
If temperatures are either colder or warmer than this ideal, warming
will be either beneficial or harmful, respectively.

Three important insights follow from this result. First, [warming will
be beneficial to relatively cool countries and harmful to relatively
warm countries. Warming will not have the same universal effect on
everybody]{.underline}. Low-latitude countries may well suffer 60 to 80
percent of the global damage (Mendelsohn et al. 2006). This is
problematic because these low-latitude countries collectively contribute
only a small fraction of global emissions. A large fraction of the
damage from climate change is not suffered by the countries causing the
emissions. There is an inherent inequity in the distribution of the
costs and benefits of greenhouse gas emissions.

Second, the warmer the planet gets, the more damage that warming will
cause. More and more countries will be pushed beyond the ideal
temperature range, and the more local temperatures exceed that range,
the greater the damage will be. Third, because the most serious damage
requires relatively high temperatures, **[[a large fraction of]{.mark}
the [damage will not occur until]{.mark} [far into the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The present value of damage is
consequently quite small.

The literature also contains one other important insight. **[[Adaptation
is very effective]{.mark} at lowering climate damage]{.underline}**
(Mendelsohn and Neumann 1999; Mendelsohn and Dinar 2009). **[[Firms,
farms, and people will all change]{.mark} their [behavior]{.mark} as
climate changes.]{.underline}** [[They will]{.mark} subtly [adjust their
timing]{.mark}, their [choices]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} their [management
to take into account]{.mark} [the climate]{.mark} that [they]{.mark}
actually [live in]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} One can see this today
by comparing the behavior of people who happen to live in different
climates. Farmers in warmer places plant crops suitable for that
climate. People wear clothing appropriate to their climate and season.
Buildings have heating and cooling systems appropriate for each climate.
People and firms adapt to climate because it is in their interest to do
so. **[Adaptation makes them better off]{.underline}**. That does not
imply there are no damages. It simply points out that **[[assuming zero
adaptation is not realistic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The damage is much
lower when people adjust. It may be more difficult to predict what will
happen with adaptation]{.underline}, **[but simply assuming it away
leads to overly pessimistic predictions of damage]{.underline}**.
[Predictions of impacts from climate change must take private adaptation
into account in order to provide accurate measures of future
damages]{.underline} (Mendelsohn 2000).

### 1AR\-\--Climate Change\-\--Ext\-\--Inevitable

#### It's irreversible

**Adler 15** -- Ben Adler, Grist Journalist on Environmental Policy and
Politics, 6/22/15, \"James Hansen's New Climate Study is Terrifying, but
He Still Has Hope,\"
<https://grist.org/climate-energy/james-hansens-new-climate-study-is-terrifying-but-he-still-has-hope/>

[Hansen and his colleagues]{.underline} combined analysis of the
historical record with modeling and current observation and [found that
the rate of oceanic ice melting in Greenland and Antarctica may exceed
our expectations.]{.underline} As InsideClimate News explains, the
scientists "analyzed how [an influx of cold freshwater from the planet's
[melting ice sheets will disrupt]{.mark} the [ocean]{.mark}'s
[circulation]{.mark} ... They concluded the influx of freshwater from
melting ice sheets in modern times would essentially shut down the
ocean's circulation, [causing]{.mark} cool water to stay in the
[Earth]{.mark}'s polar regions and equatorial water [to **warm**]{.mark}
**up even [faster]{.mark}**."]{.underline} "The cooling mechanism is cut
off, so it's melting ice shelves," Hansen explained in an interview with
Grist. ["It's a really dangerous situation where you get
**[melting]{.mark} that [causes more melting]{.mark}**."]{.underline}
Hansen also says that in the past, [temperature [increases of **1
degree**]{.mark} **Celsius** have [resulted in higher sea levels]{.mark}
than we have projected]{.underline} to accompany that temperature rise
in the future. The bottom line, as Slate's Eric Holthaus writes, is that
["glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica will melt 10 times faster than
previous consensus estimates, resulting in sea-level rise of at least 10
feet in as little as 50 years."]{.underline} A sea-level rise of [10
feet would inundate parts of major cities from New York to
Shanghai.]{.underline} These findings, if accurate, have major policy
implications. You're probably familiar with the the target of keeping
global average temperatures from increasing more than 2 degrees Celsius
above pre-industrial levels. It's a widely cited goal for the climate
movement, based on a combination of the best we can realistically hope
to achieve and estimates of the threshold at which dangerous feedback
loops will begin to make global warming and its effects escalate
exponentially. So far, [**we've already warmed about
0.8C**,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} even if we turned off the
greenhouse gas spigot tomorrow, [[we've got a couple of decades of
warming ahead]{.mark} of us [from]{.mark} our [recent
emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Meanwhile, as global emissions keep
rising, some scientists argue that [**[2C is]{.mark} at this point
[already]{.mark} an [unrealistic]{.mark} goal** because the global
community simply isn't reducing emissions enough to get
there.]{.underline} But [Hansen's study suggests that even 2C is too
unambitious, [and]{.mark} that [the point]{.mark} at which
**[warming]{.mark} [becomes exponential]{.mark} instead of linear**
[is]{.mark} more like [1.5C.]{.mark}]{.underline} Other scientists have
reached similar conclusions recently, like those behind a U.N. report
issued in May that looked at the effect of sea-level rise on Pacific
island nations. And so Hansen frames his findings as a plea to world
leaders to pursue that new target.

[[Signs indicate we\'ve **reached the threshold**]{.mark} scientists
fear, [heralding **abrupt**]{.mark} **and [irreversible
change]{.mark}**.]{.underline} At 2C over the pre-industrial average,
[the [warming we]{.mark} have [already caused will trigger effects we
cannot control, including huge releases]{.mark} of carbon dioxide
[from]{.mark} the warming [oceans]{.mark}]{.underline}. Photo / AP If
you spend a lot of time talking to scientists about climate change,
there\'s one word you\'ll hear time and time again, and yet it\'s hardly
ever mentioned in the public discussion of climate change. The word is
\"non-linear\". Most people think of global warming as an incremental
thing. It may be inexorable, but it\'s also predictable. Alas, most
people are wrong. The climate is a very complex system, and complex
systems can change in non-linear ways. In other words, you [cannot count
on]{.underline} the [average global temp]{.underline}erature [rising
steadily but slowly]{.underline} as we pump more and more greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere. It may do that - but [[there may]{.mark} also
[be a sudden jump]{.mark} in]{.underline} the [average global
temp]{.underline}erature [that lands you in a world of hurt. That may be
happening now]{.underline}. \"[We are moving into uncharted territory
with frightening speed]{.underline},\" said Michel Jarraud,
secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organisation, last
November. He was [referring to the unprecedented way the warming is now
accelerating. The hottest year ever was 2014 - until 2015 beat it by a
wide margin; 2016 may beat it by an even wider margin.]{.underline} It
was the hottest January ever - and then the average global temperature
in February was a full fifth of a degree Celsius higher than January.
That was [a huge jump]{.underline}, since the \"average global
temperature\" is an average of all the temperatures over the seas and
the land in both the summer hemisphere and the winter hemisphere. [It is
normally a very stable figure, changing no more than a few hundredths of
a degree from year to year.]{.underline} But March was not only hotter
than February, it was hotter by an even wider margin than February was
over January. Indeed, each of the past 11 months has beaten the highest
previously recorded average temperature for that month. *It could be
some random short-term fluctuation \... \[but\]* [it feels a lot more
like part of a trend]{.underline}. Some people try to explain this all
away by blaming it on El Nino, a periodical rise in the ocean surface
temperature in the eastern Pacific that moves the rainfall patterns
around worldwide, causing droughts here and floods there. But El Nino is
a LOCAL rise in temperature, it does not normally affect the average
global temperature much. The frightening acceleration in the warming in
the past three months has no precedent in any El Nino year, or indeed in
any previous year. It could be some random short-term fluctuation in
average global temperature, but coming on top of the record warming of
2014 and 2015 it feels a lot more like part of a trend. [[Could this be
non-linear]{.mark} change, an [abrupt and **irreversible**]{.mark}
change? **[Yes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And if it is, how far will it go
before it stabilises again at some higher average global temperature?
Nobody knows. Last year the average global temperature hit 1C higher
than the pre-industrial average. That is halfway to the plus-two degree
level which all the world\'s Governments have agreed we must never
exceed, but at least we got to plus-one slowly, over a period of two
centuries. The plus-two threshold matters because that\'s when the
warming we have already caused triggers effects we cannot control: the
loss of the Arctic sea-ice, the melting of the permafrost, and immense
releases of CO2 from the warming oceans. After plus-two, we will no
longer be able to stop the warming by ending our own greenhouse gas
emissions. Even at the global climate summit in Paris in December, there
was still hope we might avoid triggering the effects, because the
historic rate of warming would still give us about 25 years to work on
cutting our emissions before we reach plus-two. But if the current
non-linear surge in warming persists, we could have covered half the
remaining distance and reached plus 1.5C by the end of this year.
Obviously most scientists will not go this far in public, but they are
very worried. [As Professor Stefan Rahmstorf]{.underline} of the Potsdam
Institute of Climate Impact Research [told]{.underline} the *Guardian*
recently: \"[[We are in a]{.mark} kind of climate [emergency]{.mark}
now]{.underline}.\" Ten years ago I spent almost a year interviewing the
world\'s leading climate scientists for a book I was writing. I learned
[[all]{.mark} our [calculations]{.mark} for dealing with climate change
c[ould be swept aside by a non-linear event]{.mark}. This could be
it.]{.underline}

"Empirical evidence for a celestial origin of the climate oscillations
and its implications," Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial
Physics Vol. 72, No. 13, p. 951--970)

On secular, millenarian and larger time scales **[[astronomical
oscillations and solar changes drive climate
variations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Shaviv's]{.underline}
[theory]{.underline} \[2003\] [can explain]{.underline} the
[large]{.underline} 145 Myr [climate oscillations during]{.underline}
the last **[600 million years.]{.underline}** Milankovic's theory
\[1941\] can explain the multi-millennial climate oscillations¶ observed
during the last 1000 kyr. [Climate oscillations with]{.underline}¶
[periods of 2500, 1500, and 1000 years during the]{.underline} last
10,000¶ year (the [Holocene]{.underline}) [are correlated to equivalent
solar cycles]{.underline}¶ [that caused the Minoan, Roman, Medieval and
Modern warm]{.underline}¶ [periods]{.underline} \[Bond *et al.*, 2001;
Kerr, 2001\]. Finally, several other¶ authors found that multisecular
solar oscillations caused bisecular¶ little ice ages (for example: the
Sp¨orer, Maunder, Dalton¶ minima) during the last 1000 years \[for
example: Eddy,¶ 1976; Eichler *et al.*, 2009; Scafetta and West, 2007;
Scafetta, 2009, 2010\].

Herein, [we]{.underline} have [found [empirical evidences
that]{.mark}]{.underline} the climate¶
[[oscillations]{.underline}]{.mark} within the secular scale
[[are]{.mark} very likely [driven by¶ astronomical cycles]{.mark}, too.
Cycles]{.underline} with periods of 10-11, 12, 15,¶ 20-22, 30 and 60
years [are present **in all major surface temperature¶
records**]{.underline} [since 1850, and can be easily linked
to]{.underline} the [orbits]{.underline}¶ of Jupiter and Saturn. The 11
and 22-year cycles are the wellknown¶ Schwabe and Hale solar cycles.
Other faster cycles with¶ periods between 5 and 10 years are in common
between the¶ temperature records and the astronomical cycles. Long-term¶
lunar cycles induce a 9.1-year cycle in the temperature records¶ and
probably other cycles, including an 18.6-year cycle in some¶ regions
\[McKinnell and Crawford, 2007\]. [A quasi-60 year cycle]{.underline}¶
[has been found in numerous multi-secular climatic
records]{.underline},¶ and it is even present in the traditional
Chinese, Tibetan and¶ Tamil calendars, which are arranged in major
60-year cycles.¶ [The physical mechanisms that would explain this result
are]{.underline}¶ [still unknown. Perhaps]{.underline} the four jovian
[planets modulate solar]{.underline}¶ [activity via gravitational and
magnetic forces that cause tidal]{.underline}¶ [and angular momentum
stresses on the Sun and its heliosphere.]{.underline}

Then, [a [varying Sun]{.mark} modulates climate, which
[amplifies]{.mark} the effects¶ of the solar input through several
[feedback mechanisms]{.mark}.¶ This phenomenon is mostly regulated by
Jupiter]{.underline} and [Saturn]{.underline},¶ plus some important
contribution [from Neptune and Uranus]{.underline},¶ which modulate a
bi-secular cycle with their 172 year synodic¶ period. This
interpretation is supported by the fact that the [11-]{.underline}¶
[year solar cycles and the solar flare occurrence appear
synchronized]{.underline}¶ [to the tides generated on]{.underline} the
Sun by Venus, [Earth]{.underline} and¶ Jupiter \[Hung, 2007\]. Moreover,
[a 60-year cycle and other¶ planetary cycles have been found in
millennial solar records¶]{.underline} \[Ogurtsov *et al.*, 2002\]
[and]{.underline} in the number of [middle latitude¶
auroras]{.underline} \[Komitov, 2009\].

Alternatively, the planets are directly influencing the Earth's¶ climate
by modulating the orbital parameters of the Earth-Moon¶ system and of
the Earth. Orbital parameters can modulate the¶ Earth's angular momentum
via gravitational tides and magnetic¶ forces. Then, these orbital
oscillations are amplified by the climate¶ system through
synchronization of its natural oscillators.¶ This interpretation is
supported by the fact that the temperature¶ records contain a clear
9.1-year cycle, which is associated to¶ some long-term lunar tidal
cycles. However, the climatic influence¶ of theMoon may be more subtle
because several planetary¶ cycles are also found in the Earth-Moon
system.¶ The astronomical forcings may be modulating the length¶ of the
day (LOD). LOD presents a 60-year cycle that anticipates¶ the 60-year
temperature cycle \[Klyashtorin 2001; Klyashtorin¶ and Lyubushin, 2007,
2009; Mazzarella, 2007, 2008;¶ Sidorenkov and Wilson, 2009\]. A LOD
change can drive the¶ ocean oscillations by exerting some pressure on
the ocean floor¶ and by modifying the Coriolis' forces. In particular,
the large¶ ocean oscillations such as the AMO and PDO oscillations are¶
likely driven by astronomical oscillations.¶ The [results]{.underline}
herein found [show]{.underline} that [the climate
[oscillations]{.mark}]{.underline}¶ [are [driven by **multiple
astronomical mechanisms**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Indeed, the¶
[planets]{.underline} with their [movement cause the entire solar system
to]{.underline}¶ [vibrate]{.underline} with a set of frequencies that
are closely related to the¶ orbital periods of the planets. The
[wobbling of the Sun]{.underline} around¶ the center of mass of the
solar system [is]{.underline} just [the clearest
manifestation]{.underline}¶ [of these solar system
vibrations]{.underline} and has been used¶ herein just as a proxy for
studying those vibrations. The Sun,¶ the Earth-Moon system and the Earth
feel these oscillations,¶ and it is reasonable that the [internal
physical processes of the]{.underline}¶ [Earth and the Sun
synchronize]{.underline} to them.

It is evident that we can still infer, by means of a detailed data¶
analysis, that **[[the solar system]{.mark} likely
[induces]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[climate
[oscillations]{.mark}]{.underline}**,¶ although the actual mechanisms
that explain the observed¶ climate oscillations are still unknown. [If
the true climate mechanisms]{.underline}¶ [were already known and well
understood, the general]{.underline}¶ [circulation climate models would
properly reproduce]{.underline} the [cli-]{.underline}¶ [mate
oscillations.]{.underline} However, we found that [this is not the
case.]{.underline}¶ For example, we showed that [the GISS ModelE fails
to reproduce]{.underline}¶ the climate [oscillations at multiple time
scales, including]{.underline}¶ [the]{.underline} large 60[-year
cycle.]{.underline} This [[failure is common to all]{.mark} climate¶
[models adopted by the IPCC]{.mark}]{.underline} \[2007\] as it is
evident in their figures¶ 9.5 and SPM.5 that show the multi-model global
average¶ simulation of surface warming. This failure indicates that the¶
models on which the [[IPCC's claims]{.mark} are based are still
**incomplete¶ and possibly [flawed]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The existence of a 60-year natural cycle in the climate system,¶ which
is clearly proven in multiple studies and herein in¶ Figures 2, 6, 10
and 12, indicates that the AGWT promoted by¶ the IPCC \[2007\], which
claims that 100% of the global warming¶ observed since 1970 is
anthropogenic, is erroneous. In fact,¶ since 1970 a globalwarming of
about 0.5 *oC* has been observed.¶ However, from 1970 to 2000 the
60-year natural cycle was in¶ his warming phase and has contributed no
less than 0.3 *oC* of the¶ observed 0.5 *oC* warming, as Figure 10B
shows. Thus, [**at least¶ [60% of]{.mark} the observed [warming]{.mark}
since 1970 [has been naturally]{.mark}¶ [induced]{.mark}.** This leaves
less than 40%]{.underline} of the observed warming¶ [to human
emissions.]{.underline} Consequently, the current climate
[models]{.underline},¶ by failing to simulate the observed quasi-60 year
temperature¶ cycle, [have significantly overestimated]{.underline} the
[climate sensitivity]{.underline}¶ [to]{.underline} anthropogenic [GHG
emissions by]{.underline} likely [a factor of three.]{.underline}¶
Moreover, the upward trend observed in the temperature data¶ since
1900may be partially due to land change use, uncorrected¶ urban heat
island effects \[McKitrick andMichaels, 2007;McKitrick,¶ 2010\] and to
the bi-secular and millennial solar cycles¶ that reached their maxima
during the last decades \[Bond *et al.*,¶ 2001; Kerr, 2001; Eichler *et
al.*, 2009; Scafetta, 2010\].

As already noted, [the [IPCC]{.mark} scenarios]{.underline} themselves
**[[are wildly alarmist]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not only on the basic
science but also [on the]{.underline} **[underlying]{.underline}**
economic **[assumptions]{.underline}**, which in turn drive the alarmist
impacts. [The result]{.underline} **[cannot withstand critical
analysis]{.underline}**. Economists Ian Castles and David Henderson, for
example, show the extent to which the analysis is driven by the desire
to reach predetermined outcomes.50 Other economists have similarly
wondered what purpose was served by pursuing such unrealistic scenarios.
It is hard to credit the defense put forward by Mike Hulme, one of the
creators of the scenarios, that the IPCC is not engaged in forecasting
the future but in creating "plausible" story lines of what might happen
under various scenarios.51 [[Each]{.underline} **[scare
scenario]{.underline}** [is based on]{.underline}]{.mark} [linear
[projections without]{.mark}]{.underline} **[any [reference to
tech]{.mark}nological developments [or
adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If, on a similar linear basis, our
Victorian ancestors in the UK, worried about rapid urbanization and
population growth in London, had made similar projections, they would
have pointed to the looming crisis arising from reliance on horse-drawn
carriages and omnibuses; they would have concluded that by the middle of
the 20th century, London would be knee-deep in horse manure, and all of
the southern counties would be required to grow the oats and hay to feed
and bed the required number of horses. Technology progressed and London
adapted. **[Why should the rest of humanity not be able to do
likewise]{.underline}** [in the face of a trivial rise in temperature
over the course of **more than a century**]{.underline}? [The work on
physical impacts is]{.underline} **[equally over the top]{.underline}**.
[[All]{.mark} the [scenarios assume]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[only
negative impacts]{.underline}**, [ignore]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
reality of]{.underline} [**[adaptation]{.underline}**, [and attribute
**any**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**and all things [bad]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Assuming the GHG
theory to be correct means that its impact would be most evident at
night and during the winter]{.underline} in reducing atmospheric heat
loss to outer space.52 It would have greater impact in increasing
minimum temperatures than in increasing maximum temperatures. Secondary
[studies]{.underline}, however, generally **[ignore this
facet]{.underline}** of the hypothesis. [The IPCC believes that a warmer
world will harm human health]{.underline} [due]{.underline}, for
example, [to increased disease, malnutrition, heat-waves, floods,
storms, and cardiovascular incidents]{.underline}. As already noted
**[[there is no basis for]{.mark} the claim about
severe-[weather]{.mark}-related [threats or
malnutrition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The claim about heat-related deaths
gained a boost during the summer of 2003 because of the tragedy of some
15,000 alleged heat-related deaths in France as elderly people stayed
behind in city apartments without air conditioning while their children
enjoyed the heat at the sea shore during the August vacation.
Epidemiological studies of so-called \"excess\" deaths resulting from
heat waves are abused to get the desired results. Similar studies of the
impact of cold spells show that they are far more lethal than heat waves
and that it is much easier to adapt to heat than to cold.53 More
fundamentally, this, like most of the alarmist literature, ignores the
basics of the AGW hypothesis: the world will not see an exponential
increase in summer, daytime heat (and thus more heat waves), but a
decrease in night-time and winter cooling, particularly at higher
latitudes and altitudes. Based on the AGW hypothesis, Canada, China,
Korea, Northern Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, and
Argentina will see warmer winters and warmer nights. There are clear
benefits to such a development, even if there may also be problems, but
the AGW industry tends to ignore the positive aspects of their alarmist
scenarios. The feared [spread of [malaria]{.mark}]{.underline}, a much
repeated claim, [[is]{.mark} largely [unrelated]{.mark} to
climate]{.underline}. [Malaria's worst recorded outbreak]{.underline}
**[was in Siberia long before there was any discussion of
AGW]{.underline}**. Similarly, the building of the Rideau Canal in
Ottawa in the 1820s was severely hampered by outbreaks of malaria due to
the proximity of mosquito-infested wetlands in the area. Malaria remains
widespread in tropical countries today in part because of the UN's
lengthy embargo on the use of DDT, the legacy of an earlier alarmist
disaster. Temperature is but one factor, and a minor one at that, in the
multiple factors that affect the rise or decline in the presence of
disease-spreading mosquitoes. Wealthier western countries have pursued
public health strategies that have reduced the incidence of the dis-
ease in their countries. Entomologist Paul Reiter, widely recognized as
the leading specialist on malaria vectors and a contributor to some of
the early work of the IPCC, was aghast to learn how his careful and
systematic analysis of the potential impacts had been twisted in ways
that he could not endorse. In a recent paper, he concludes: "Simplistic
reasoning on the future prevalence of malaria is ill-founded; malaria is
not limited by climate in most temperate regions, nor in the tropics,
and in nearly all cases, 'new\' malaria at high altitudes is well below
the maximum altitudinal limits for transmission. Future changes in
climate may alter the prevalence and incidence of the disease, but
obsessive emphasis on 'global warming\' as a dominant parameter is
indefensible; the principal determinants are linked to ecological and
societal change, politics and economics."54 **[Catastrophic [species
loss]{.mark}]{.underline}** [similarly [has]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[significant [scope]{.mark} and opportunity for
[adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [including by ﬂora and

group of UK [[modelers]{.underline}]{.mark} who [[fed]{.mark} wildly
[improbable scenarios]{.mark} and data into their computers and produced
the much-touted claim of massive species loss]{.underline} by the end of
the century. [There are literally]{.underline} **[thousands of websites
devoted to spreading alarm about species loss]{.underline}** and
biodiversity. [Global [warming is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[but one of
many]{.mark} claimed human [threats to]{.mark} the planet's
[biodiversity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The [claims]{.mark},]{.underline}
fortunately, [[are]{.mark} largely [hype]{.mark}]{.underline}, based on
computer models and the estimate by Harvard naturalist Edward O. Wilson
that 27,000 to 100,000 species are lost annually - a figure he advanced
purely hypothetically but which has become one of the most persistent of
environmental urban myths. The fact is that [scientists]{.underline}
**[have no idea of the extent of the world\'s ﬂora and
fauna]{.underline}**, with estimates ranging from five million to 100
million species, and that [there are no reliable data about the rate of
loss]{.underline}. By some estimates, [[95 per cent of]{.mark} the
[species]{.mark} that ever existed [have been lost]{.mark} over the
eons]{.underline}, most before humans became major players in altering
their environment. A much more credible estimate of recent species loss
comes from a surprising source, the UN Environmental Program. It reports
that known **[species [loss is slowing reaching its lowest level in 500
years]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the last three decades of the 20th
century, with some 20 reported extinctions despite increasing pressure
on the biosphere from growing human population and industrialization.57
The alarmist community has also introduced the scientifically unknown
concept of \"locally extinct," often meaning little more than that [a
species of plant or animal has responded to adverse conditions by moving
to more hospitable circumstances]{.underline}, e.g., birds or
butterflies becoming more numerous north of their range and disappearing
at its extreme southern extent. Idso et al. conclude: "Many [species

[The [**most likely** levels of]{.mark} global [warming are **very
unlikely to cause**]{.mark} **human
[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.15 The [[existential risks]{.mark} of
climate change]{.underline} instead [[stem from tail
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} climate change -- [[the **low probability** of
extreme]{.mark} levels of [warming]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [and
interaction with other sources of risk]{.underline}. It is impossible to
say with confidence at what point global warming would become severe
enough to pose an existential threat. Research has suggested that
[**warming of 11-[12°C]{.mark}** [would render]{.mark} most of [the
planet uninhabitable]{.mark}]{.underline},16 and would completely
devastate agriculture.17 This would pose an extreme threat to human
civilisation as we know it.18 Warming of around 7°C or more could
potentially produce conflict and instability on such a scale that the
indirect effects could be an existential risk, although it is extremely
uncertain how likely such scenarios are.19 Moreover, [the
[timescales]{.mark} over which such changes might happen could
[mean]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[humanity is able to
adapt]{.underline}]{.mark}** enough [[to avoid extinction in
**even**]{.mark} **very [extreme scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The probability of these levels of warming depends on eventual
greenhouse gas concentrations. According to some experts, [unless strong
action is taken soon by major emitters]{.underline}, it is likely that
[we will pursue a medium-high emissions pathway]{.underline}.20 If we
do, the chance of extreme warming is highly uncertain but appears
non-negligible. Current concentrations of greenhouse gases are higher
than they have been for hundreds of thousands of years,21 which means
that there are significant unknown unknowns about how the climate system
will respond. Particularly concerning is the risk of positive feedback
loops, such as the release of vast amounts of methane from melting of
the arctic permafrost, which would cause rapid and disastrous warming.22
The economists Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman have used IPCC figures
(which do not include modelling of feedback loops such as those from
melting permafrost) to estimate that [if we continue to pursue a
medium-high emissions pathway]{.underline}, the [[probability of]{.mark}
eventual warming of [6°]{.mark}C [is]{.mark} around
**[10%]{.mark}**]{.underline},23 [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} of
[[10°]{.mark}C [is]{.mark}]{.underline} around
**[[3%]{.underline}]{.mark}**.24 [[These]{.mark} estimates
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} of course **[[highly
uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[It is **likely**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the world will take
action]{.mark} against climate change [once it begins to impose]{.mark}
large [costs]{.mark}]{.underline} on human society, **[[long
before]{.mark} there is warming of [10°]{.mark}C]{.underline}**.
Unfortunately, there is significant inertia in the climate system: there
is a 25 to 50 year lag between CO2 emissions and eventual warming,25 and
it is expected that 40% of the peak concentration of CO2 will remain in
the atmosphere 1,000 years after the peak is reached.26 Consequently, it
is impossible to reduce temperatures quickly by reducing CO2 emissions.
If the world does start to face costly warming, the international
community will therefore face strong incentives to find other ways to
reduce global temperatures.

[The]{.underline} **[[impacts of]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[are]{.mark} generally [estimated
using]{.mark}]{.underline} [chains of linked [computer
models]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Each chain begins with a climate
model]{.underline}, [which itself is driven by a set of socioeconomic
scenarios based on assumptions for population]{.underline}, economic
development and technological change over the entire period of the
analysis (often 50-- 100 years or more). [The climate model is followed
by various biophysical, economic and other downstream models to estimate
changes in different aspects of human]{.underline} 23
[activity]{.underline} or welfare, for example agriculture, forestry,
health or biodiversity. [The **[uncertain outputs]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of each upstream model serve as the inputs of the subsequent downstream
model]{.underline}, [with the]{.underline} [uncertainties]{.underline}
**[[cascad]{.mark}ing [down]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the chain so that
the individual streams of uncertainty combine into a regular
torrent.]{.underline} For example, to estimate the impacts on
agriculture and food security, the outputs of the climate model are fed
into various crop models to estimate yields, which then are linked to
economic models to estimate supply and demand for the various crops.
Supply and demand are then reconciled via national, regional and global
scale trade models.142 Notably, despite the cascade of uncertainties,
[to date]{.underline} **[[no]{.mark} climate change impact
[assessment]{.mark}]{.underline}** [has [provided
an]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[objective estimate]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[of the cumulative uncertainty]{.underline}, starting with the
socioeconomic scenarios through to the impact estimate. The ranges of
uncertainty presented in the IPCC impact reports are generally based on
the uncertainties only from using different climate scenarios. But these
are much narrower than the true uncertainties that would have been
estimated had the full cascade of uncertainties been considered. Models
have not been validated [[One reason]{.mark} that]{.underline}
**[[doom-laden predictions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [about human wellbeing
have]{.underline} [**[failed]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that [orthodox]{.mark} climate [scientists]{.mark} have neglected to
apply the scientific method]{.underline}: [specifically they [have not
checked]{.mark} their [hypotheses and biases]{.mark} embodied in their
models]{.underline} against empirical reality. As we have seen, simple
reality checks show that [environmental and human wellbeing is not
currently deteriorating]{.underline}. Validation of these models using
such reality checks would have limited their divergence from reality,
and also reduce the uncertainties that are inevitably compounded as one
progresses down the chain of models. [Climate
[models]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[overstate]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline}** Firstly, [the global [climate has not
been warming]{.mark} **as [rapidly]{.mark}** as projected
in]{.underline} the IPCC assessment reports. Figure 5 compares observed
global surface temperature data from 1986 through 2012 versus modelled
results. It confirms that models have been running hotter than reality.
But these are the projections that governments have relied on to justify
global warming policies, including subsidies for biofuels and renewable
energy while increasing the overall cost of energy to the general
consumer -- costs that disproportionately burden those that are poorer.
A comparison of performance of 117 simulations using 37 models versus
empirical data from the HadCRUT4 surface temperature data set indicates
that the vast majority of the simulations/models have overestimated
warming.143 The models indicated that the average global temperature
would increase by 0.30±0.02◦Cper decade during the period from 1993 to
2012 but empirical data show an increase of only 0.14±0.06◦C per
decade.144 Model performance was even worse for the more recent 15-year
period of 1998--2012. Here the average modelled trend was 0.21±0.03◦C
per decade, quadruple the observed trend of 0.05±0.08◦C. Considering the
confidence interval, the observed trend is indistinguishable from no
trend at all; that is, warming has, for practical purposes, halted. Even
the IPCC acknowledges the existence of this 'hiatus'.145 Moreover, the
HadCRUT4 temperature database indicates that the global warming rate
declined from 0.11◦C per decade from 1951--2012 to 0.04◦C per decade
from 1998--2012.146 This is despite the fact that, per the IPCC, the
anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing for 2010 (2.25 W/m2) exceeded what
was used in the models for 2010 (1.78--1.84 W/m2) by around 25%.147 Some
have argued that satellite temperature data should be preferred over
surface datasets. In fact, satellite coverage is more comprehensive and
more representative of the Earth's surface than is achievable using
surface stations, even if the latter were to number in the thousands. A
recent review paper notes that satellites can provide 'unparalleled
global- and fine-scale spatial coverage' presumably because of 'more
frequent and repetitive coverage over a larger area than other
observation means'.148 In addition, surface measurements are influenced
by the measuring stations' microenvironments, which will vary not only
from station to station at any given time, but also over time at the
very same station, as vegetation and man-made structures in their
vicinity spring up, evolve and change.149 Satellite temperature data
indicates that the globe has been warming at the rate of 0.12--0.14◦C
per decade since 1979;150 by contrast, the IPCC assessments over the
last 25 years have been projecting a warming trend of 0.2--0.4◦C per
decade.151,152 The 25 differences between modelled trends and those from
satellites and weather balloons are shown in Figures 6 and 7.153
Nevertheless, [based on these chains of]{.underline} **[unvalidated
computer models]{.underline}**, **[orthodox thinkers]{.underline}** [on
climate change claim that global warming will]{.underline}, among other
things, lower food production, increase hunger, cause more extreme
weather, increase disease, and threaten water supplies. The cumulative
impact will, they claim, [diminish living standards and threaten
species, and]{.underline} if carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
are not curbed soon, **[pose an existential threat to
humanity]{.underline}** and the rest of nature. Some claim it may
already be too late.154 [The group 350]{.underline}.org, for instance,
[agitates for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, currently at
400 ppm, to 350 ppm]{.underline}, a level the earth last experienced [in
1988]{.underline}.155 But **[since then, global GDP per capita has
increased 60%, infant mortality has declined 48%,]{.underline}** **[life
expectancy has increased by 5.5]{.underline}** years, **[and the poverty
headcount has dropped from 43% to 17%]{.underline}** despite a
population increase of 40%. [Nostalgia for a 350 ppm world
seems]{.underline} somewhat misplaced, if not **[downright
perverse]{.underline}**.156,157 Climate models don't do local well It is
not clear what logical process was used to arrive at these allegations.
It may stem from the fact that orthodox thinkers on climate, in the grip
of confirmation bias, are unable or unwilling to acknowledge that,
unless a climate or weather event is truly unprecedented then the
default assumption -- the 'null hypothesis' in scientific parlance --
should be that it is part of normal climate variability rather than
manmade global warming. Some have used the results of modelling
exercises that purport to assess the future impacts, usually in the
latter part of this century, and then 'interpolated' these results back
to the present day.158,159,160 The first step in such an exercise relies
on climate models to project the future climate. But we have seen that
these models have failed the reality test with respect to globally
averaged surface temperature over the past two decades or more. To
compound matters, the performance of climate models relative to reality
worsens as one attempts to project surface temperatures at smaller
geographical scales. 27 Climate models don't do precipitation well More
importantly, the wellbeing of human beings and the rest of nature is
probably more sensitive to changes in precipitation than to temperature,
and precipitation is highly variable from spot to spot. But climate
models perform even worse for precipitation than they do for
temperature, regardless of the geographic scale. In fact, for several
areas many models are unable to reliably hindcast past precipitation,
let alone forecast the future.161,162 Notsurprisingly, precipitation
projections using different models often contradict each other. For
example, a recent study of annual precipitation changes in California
using 25 model projections indicates that '12 projections show drier
annual conditions by the 2060s and 13 show wetter.'163 Thus impact
assessments that use as their starting point the outputs of these
climate models cannot and should not be relied upon to develop policies,
although they may have scientific diagnostic value for improving our
understanding of climate mechanisms and processes. [**Adaptation
methodology is flawed**]{.underline} Failure to properly account for
adaptation **[[Even if]{.underline}]{.mark}** [climate [models
represented]{.mark} reality [perfectly]{.mark}]{.underline} and were
able to foretell the future climate, **[impact [assessments would still
be suspect]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This is [because most]{.mark} global
warming impact assessments [assume]{.mark} little or
[no]{.mark}]{.underline} endogenous (or autonomous)
**[[adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, [the vast majority
of studies of global warming impacts on water resources do not
incorporate any allowance for adaptive measures that might be taken to
**reduce those impacts**]{.underline}, despite the fact that steps of
this nature have been taken since time immemorial.164,165 For instance,
the world's oldest functioning dam, at Lake Homs in Syria, dates back to
1319 BC,166 and qanats, underground canals to convey water for human
settlements and irrigation, were built in Persia as long ago as the
first millennium BC.167 Similarly, of the many studies used by the IPCC
to estimate future impacts on crop yields, 63% did not consider
improvements in the agricultural sector's adaptive capacity.168
Moreover, specific adaptive measures used in many global warming impact
studies are based on surveys of available technologies from the 1990s.
However, today [[suitable]{.mark} adaptation [measures are]{.mark} both
more **[numerous and cheap]{.mark}**]{.underline}er.169 And because we
are wealthier, [these options are even more affordable]{.underline}.170
Consequently, [our [ability to adapt]{.mark} has]{.underline}
**[[improved markedly]{.underline}]{.mark}** [just [in]{.mark} the
[past]{.mark} few [decades]{.mark} or so]{.underline}.171 As proof,
[consider the previously noted global [increases
in]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [crop
[yields]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [access to]{.underline}]{.mark} [safer
[water]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and life expectancy on one
hand]{.underline}, [[and reductions in]{.mark} poverty and [mortality
from]{.mark} vector-borne [diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} and extreme
weather events on the other. [These examples [suggest]{.mark} that
[neglecting]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[adaptive capacity]{.underline}**
[and **tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[nological change
can]{.underline}**, [over the course of several decades]{.underline},
[[lead to estimates]{.mark} of impacts that are **[too
pessimistic]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by an **order of
magnitude**]{.underline}]{.mark} or more.172 28 [Another factor that is
ignored]{.underline} in impacts assessments [is the tremendous increase
in our interconnectedness]{.underline} due to the internet, e-mail, text
messages, and cell phones. As a result, [the dissemination of knowledge
is today far faster and wider than what was possible two or three
decades ago]{.underline}. [This increase in connectivity alone
has]{.underline} [**considerably enhanced** humanity's adaptive
capacity]{.underline}.173 [Also ignored is]{.underline} the array of
technologies that are collectively called '[precision
farming]{.underline}': [the growing ability to monitor plant growth,
nutrient deficiencies and the environmental conditions]{.underline} at
finer scales, combined with techniques that use GPS and drones to more
precisely deliver nutrients and water to crops. Today these technologies
can be afforded by wealthy farmers in rich countries. Over time, they
should, like all other technologies, also diffuse around the world as
their costs drop and as rising incomes make them more affordable. Such
techniques should reduce agriculture's demand for water. Because
agriculture is responsible for about 70% of global water consumption,
this ought to free up water for other human uses and substantially
reduce water stress.174 A 20% increase in global agricultural water-use
efficiency should, for example, translate into a global increase of 39%
in water available for nonagricultural use.

#### It's necessary but not sufficient -- scope of the problem means demand reduction must come with supply shifts

[[Renewable Energy **Cannot** Sustain]{.mark} Consumer
[Societies]{.mark}]{.underline} Trainer (2007) has also leveled a
narrower critique of technological solutions, which focuses on renewable
energy. [Resisting the common assumption]{.underline} that
[renewable]{.underline} energy [systems]{.underline} can [drive
growth]{.underline} economies and support consumer societies, [Trainer
set]{.underline} himself the task of [examining the]{.underline}
crucially important and largely [**neglected question** of what the
limits of renewable energy sources might be]{.underline}. This is not
the place to review in detail Trainer's arguments and research. For the
facts and figures, readers are referred to Trainer's books and essays
(esp. 2007, 2010b, 2012a). But the critical findings of his research can
be easily summarized. [After [examining]{.mark}]{.underline} the
evidence on varieties of [solar, wind, biomass, hydrogen and other kinds
of energy, as well as]{.underline} energy [storage and distribution
systems]{.underline}, Trainer discovered that the [[figures]{.mark}
**just [do not support]{.mark}** [what]{.mark} almost [everyone
assumes]{.mark}]{.underline}; that is to say, they do not support the
argument that renewable energy can sustain consumer societies. This is
because the [[enormous]{.mark} [quantities]{.mark} of electricity and
liquid fuels required]{.underline} by consumer societies today simply
**[[cannot be]{.mark} provided for [by any
mixture]{.mark}]{.underline}** of renewable energy sources,
[[each]{.mark} of which [suffers from]{.mark} various
[limitations]{.mark}]{.underline} arising out of
[[such]{.underline}]{.mark} factors [[as
intermittency]{.mark}]{.underline} of supply, [[storage]{.mark}
problems, [resource limitations]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., land for
biomass competing with food production) [[and
inefficiency]{.mark}]{.underline} issues[. Ultimately, however[, **the
fundamental issue**]{.mark} at play here [is]{.mark} the [cost]{.mark}.
Trainer provides evidence]{.underline} showing that [existing [attempts
to price]{.mark} the [transition]{.mark}]{.underline} to systems of
renewable energy [[are **wildly understated**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(2012a). This challenging conclusion, however, only defines the
magnitude of the present problem. [[If we]{.mark} were to
[commit]{.mark} ourselves [to]{.mark} providing
[nine]{.mark}]{.underline} or ten [[billion]{.underline}]{.mark} people
with the energy resources currently demanded by those in the richest
parts of the world, [then the problems and [costs become greater **by
orders of magnitude**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[challenges are
exacerbated]{.mark} further [by]{.mark} the]{.underline} existence of
the "[[rebound]{.mark} effect]{.underline}", a phenomenon
[that]{.underline} often **[negates]{.underline}** the [expected energy
use reductions]{.underline} of efficiency improvements (Holm and Englund
2009; Jackson 2009, ch. 4). [At times, [efficiency]{.mark} improvements
**[can]{.mark} even [be the catalyst for]{.mark} increased energy
[consumption]{.mark}**, a phenomenon known as the "Jevons"
paradox]{.underline} (e.g., Polimeni et al. 2009). Going directly
against the grain of mainstream thinking on these issues, Trainer is led
to conclude that [[renewable energy]{.mark} and efficiency improvements
[will **never**]{.mark} **be able to [sustain]{.mark}
[growth]{.mark}-based consumer societies**]{.underline}, primarily
because it would be quite unaffordable to do so. It is of the utmost
importance to emphasize that this is not an argument against renewable
energy as such; nor is it an argument more broadly against the use of
appropriate technologies to achieve efficiency improvements. Trainer
argues without reservation that the world must transition to full
dependence on systems of renewable energy without delay and exploit
appropriate technology wherever possible (Trainer 2007, 117). But [given
the limitations and expense of renewable energy systems, any
[transition]{.mark}]{.underline} to a just and sustainable [world
[requires]{.mark} a **vastly [reduced demand]{.mark}** for
energy]{.underline} compared to what is common in the developed regions
of the world today, [and [this]{.mark} [necessitates giving up
growth]{.mark}-based, consumer societies and the energy-intensive
lifestyles they support and promote.]{.underline}

#### Tech is a drop in the bucket -- we would need to be taking carbon [out]{.underline} of the air and have tech capability increase ten fold

Nonetheless, [the intractability of]{.underline} addressing both
[population and income has tended to reinforce the idea that only
technology can save us]{.underline}. Knowing that efficiency is key to
economic progress, it is tempting to place our faith in the possibility
that we can push relative decoupling fast enough that it leads in the
end to absolute decoupling. [But just how feasible is]{.underline} this?
There is a convenient \'rule of thumb\' to figure out when relative
decoupling will lead to absolute decoupling. In a growing population
with an increasing average income, [absolute decoupling will occur
when]{.underline} the rate of [relative decoupling is greater
than]{.underline} the rates of [increase in population and
income]{.underline} combined.\"0 [With this rule of thumb]{.underline}
in mind, [[its instructive to explore]{.mark} what\'s happened
[historically]{.mark}]{.underline} (and why) to global carbon dioxide
emissions. [Carbon intensities have declined]{.underline} on average [by
0.7 per cent per year]{.underline} since 1990. That\'s good, but not
good enough. Population has increased at a rate of 1.3 per cent and
average per capita income has increased by 1.4 per cent each year (in
real terms) over the same period. [[Efficiency **hasn\'t**]{.mark}
**even [compensated for]{.mark} the growth in [population]{.mark}**[,
let alone]{.mark}]{.underline} the growth in
[[incomes]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Instead]{.underline}, carbon dioxide
[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} [[have grown]{.underline}]{.mark} on
average by 1.3 + 1.4 --- 0.7 = [[2 per cent]{.mark} per
year]{.underline}, leading over 17 years to an almost 40 per cent
increase in emissions (Box 5-1).21 The same rule of thumb allows us a
quick check on the feasibility of decoupling carbon dioxide emissions
from growth in the future. The [IPCC\'s Fourth Assessment Report
suggests]{.underline} that achieving a 450 ppm stabilization target
means getting global carbon dioxide emissions down to below 4 billion
tonnes per annum by 2050 or soon after. This would be equivalent to
[reducing]{.underline} annual [emissions]{.underline} at an average rate
of [4.9 per cent per year]{.underline} between now and 2050.22 [But
income and global population are **going in the opposite
direction**]{.underline}. According to the UN\'s mid-range estimate, the
world\'s population is expected to reach 9 billion people by 2050 --- an
average growth of 0.7 per cent each year. [[Under business as
usual]{.underline}]{.mark} conditions, the [decline in carbon
intensity]{.underline} just about [balances]{.underline} the growth in
[population]{.underline} [and]{.underline} carbon dioxide [[emissions
will]{.underline}]{.mark} end up [[grow]{.underline}]{.mark}ing at about
the same rate as the average income [---[1.4 per cent]{.mark} a
year]{.underline}. [It might not sound much, but [by
2050]{.mark}]{.underline}, under these assumptions, [carbon dioxide
[emissions are **80 per cent higher**]{.mark} than they are
today]{.underline}. Not quite what the IPCC had in mind. [[In]{.mark}
achieve]{.underline} an average year-on-year [[reduction]{.mark} in
emissions of 4.9 per cent]{.underline} with 0.7 per cent population
growth and 1.4 per cent income growth, [[T has to
improve]{.underline}]{.mark} by approximately 4.9 + 0.7 + 1.4 = [7 per
cent]{.underline} each year --- [almost **[ten times faster]{.mark}**
than]{.underline} it is doing right [now]{.underline}. By 2050 the
average carbon content of economic output would need to be less than
40gCO./S, a 21-fold improvement on the current global average (Figure
5.6, Scenario 1). [In fact, **[things could get]{.mark} even
[worse]{.mark}** than this[. At]{.mark}]{.underline} the higher end of
the UN\'s population estimates --- [in]{.underline} a world of almost
[[11 billion people]{.mark} --- [business as usual would]{.mark} **more
than [double]{.mark}**]{.underline} global carbon dioxide
[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} over today\'s level. [Achieving the
2050 target]{.underline} in these circumstances [would put even more

intensity of output down to less than 30gCCX/S (Figure 5.6, Scenario
2).2» [Notably, this would still be a deeply unequal world]{.underline}.
[Business as usual income growth is usually taken to mean a steady 2 per
cent]{.underline} growth rate in the most developed countries [while the
rest of the world does its best to catch up - China and India leaping
ahead at 5---10 per cent per annum at least for a while, with Africa,
South America and parts of Asia languishing in the doldrums for decades
to come. In most]{.underline} of these [scenarios]{.underline}, both the
[incomes and the carbon footprints]{.underline} [of the developed
nations would be **more than an order of magnitude higher by 2050** than
those in the poorest nations]{.underline}. [[If we\'re]{.mark} really
[serious about fairness]{.mark}]{.underline} and want the world\'s 9

[the [economy would need to **grow 6 times**]{.mark}]{.underline}
between now and 2050, [with incomes]{.underline} growing at an average

lower than the average carbon intensity today (Figure 5.6, Scenario 4).
[Beyond 2050, of course, if growth is to continue, so must efficiency

### 2AC\-\--NPT

#### NPT is [resilient]{.underline}

**Egeland 18** \[KjøLv Egeland, Fellow at the Norwegian Academy of
International Law \"Kill the NPT Collapse Thesis,\" 7-20-2018,
<https://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/kill-the-npt-collapse-thesis/>\]

[A number of analysts]{.underline} have in recent months [contended that
the NPT process is at risk]{.underline} of "crumbling" or is damaged
"beyond repair". But the [[fear-mongering is
unfounded]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, the [[impending doom]{.mark} of
the NPT [has been prophesized]{.mark} again and again [since the]{.mark}
19[60s]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, not only is the NPT "collapse
thesis" wrong, [[it is detrimental to the goals of
non-proliferation]{.underline}]{.mark} and disarmament. The narrative
that the NPT is endlessly on the verge of disintegration fuels the
thinking that nuclear restraint is a painful sacrifice and implicitly
calls on the NPT community to protect the status quo rather than to push
for the advancement of the Treaty's goals.

The triumph of non-proliferation

In the 1960s, [[several governments viewed the NPT with intense
hostility]{.underline}]{.mark}. The German Cabinet Minister Franz-Josef
Strauß branded the NPT a "Versailles of cosmic dimensions". As late as
1978, the Chinese government described the Treaty as "a conspiracy
concocted by the USSR and the U.S. to maintain their nuclear monopoly."
But [[over time,]{.underline}]{.mark} as the superpowers twisted their
allies' arms and the non-proliferation norm took hold, [[opposition to
the Treaty waned]{.underline}]{.mark}. NPT sceptics such as Algeria,
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia, South
Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and Thailand all eventually joined. As of
today, only five UN member states are not party to the NPT. Only a
single state, North Korea, has withdrawn. Four of the NPT's
non-nuclear-weapon states parties have renounced nuclear weapons (South
Africa, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan), and many more have reversed
nuclear-weapon programmes.

The poverty of the NPT collapse thesis

It is striking, however, that the remarkable period of non-proliferation
norm consolidation from the mid-1960s till today has produced a
ceaseless flood of expert assertions that the NPT is about to collapse.
[Proponents of the collapse thesis commonly argue that a continued
reluctance]{.underline} by the nuclear-weapon states to move more
decisively towards disarmament [will push non-nuclear weapon states to
"go nuclear" or defect from the NPT.]{.underline} In other cases,
[collapse theorists argue that proliferation by one state (India, North
Korea, Iran...) will lead to a chain reaction]{.underline} whereby
numerous other states will defect from the NPT and construct their own
nuclear armouries.

The collapse thesis is often invoked in support of abolition. [If the
alternative to disarmament is NPT collapse and ensuing global
pandemonium, so goes the argument, the nuclear-armed states might prefer
to reduce and eliminate their nuclear arsenals.]{.underline}

But the use of [[the collapse thesis]{.underline}]{.mark} as an argument
for disarmament is in fact deeply counterproductive, let alone
inaccurate. [Based on the assumption that a large group of non-nuclear
states are perpetually looking for reasons to arm themselves with
weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}---[[implicitly representing
nuclear restraint as a surrender of something
positive]{.underline}]{.mark}---[the collapse thesis upholds the trope
that denuclearization is a struggle against nature]{.underline}. It
[[supports]{.underline}]{.mark} the argument [[that meaningful
disarmament measures can only be pursued once]{.underline}]{.mark}
"those without nuclear weapons \[...\] feel no need to acquire them".

[One version of the collapse thesis states that the NPT will, or could
be, seriously damaged by a failure by its parties to reach a negotiated
final document at two review conferences in a row]{.underline}. But
[[the NPT has not only survived such "failures", it has thrived and
increased its membership]{.underline}.]{.mark} In fact, the sixth NPT
Review Conference, in 2000, was the first such conference to reach
consensus on a fully negotiated final document. The CTBT, START, and New
START were negotiated on the back of the "failed" conferences in 1990
and 2005.

Another sticking point has been with regard to the monitoring and
verification of Iran's nuclear activities. Article III of the NPT states
that "Each non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes to
accept safeguards, as set forth in an agreement to be negotiated and
concluded with the International Atomic Energy Agency in accordance with
the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Agency's
safeguards system..." Fulfilling its obligation to the NPT as a NNWS,
Iran signed and ratified the [Safeguards Agreement]{.underline} (SA) in
1974. However, the [[insufficiency]{.underline}]{.mark} of the SA, as
obligated [by the NPT[, was realized]{.mark}]{.underline} in the early
1990s [when]{.underline} [Iraq's]{.underline} clandestine [nuclear
activities came out]{.underline} into the open. [It was then that
the]{.underline} decision to introduce the [Additional
Protocol]{.underline} to the SA [was made]{.underline}. [**The NPT**
Article, [however]{.mark},]{.underline} **[was [not
revised]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to make negotiation and ratification of
the AP to the SA a Treaty obligation]{.underline}. In Iran's case, for
instance, the IAEA report of June 2003 did not find Iran in violation of
the NPT, but recommended that Iran cooperate with the IAEA by providing
more information regarding its suspected nuclear activities which Iran
may not have revealed. Similarly, assessing the IAEA Director Board of
Governors adopted-resolution (GOV/2005/77) of September 24, 2005, which
recommended that Iran comply with the Board's demands, Paul K. Kerr
notes in CRS report that, "no international legal obligations required
Tehran to \[comply by the Board's demands\]." Thus, as far as the
monitoring mechanism is concerned, [the non-proliferation community
has]{.underline} already [accepted the shortcoming of the NPT
and]{.underline} **[moved beyond NPT]{.underline}** obligations and
introduced Additional Protocols to the SA. **[[Continued
emphasis]{.mark} [on the NPT]{.mark}]{.underline}** may therefore
**[[make managing]{.mark} [future]{.mark}]{.underline}** threats of
nuclear **[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration
**[[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the perspective of monitoring
and verification mechanisms. While Iran eventually agreed to an AP that
provides "extraordinary and robust monitoring, verification and
inspection," other NNWS may not agree to sign or renounce AP, using
Iran's non-violation of NPT obligations in their defense. In essence,
the Iran nuclear deal succinctly captures how [[the]{.mark} nuclear
non-proliferation [community either]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[[already]{.mark} [moved beyond the NPT]{.mark}]{.underline}
obligations, as with monitoring and verification mechanisms, [[or does
not find the provisions]{.underline}]{.mark} of the NPT [[in its best
interest]{.underline}]{.mark}, with regard to the right to uranium
enrichment. [The]{.underline} fact that [NPT]{.underline}
[[Articles]{.underline}]{.mark} [have [not]{.mark} been
[updated]{.mark}]{.underline} or revised only **[[weakens the Treaty's
relevance]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the current
[**[non-prolif]{.mark}**eration **[practice]{.mark}**s]{.underline} that
qualify as acceptable. This reality may be hard to accept given the
important role that the Treaty has played over the last four decades,
but it nonetheless remains important, especially as the
non-proliferation community is confronted with proliferation threats in
the future.

### 1AR\-\--NPT\-\--Ext\-\--Resiliency

#### Norms are strong enough to withstand collapse

**Kimura, 5** (Akira, Professor---Kagoshima University, "What Can We Do
to Resolve the Crisis in the NPT Regime?", 5-6,
<http://serv.peace.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp/English/anew/KimuraE.pdf>)

The NPT regime was not established with the sole aim of obligating the
member nations to simply ensure nuclear nonproliferation, that is the
prevention of proliferation of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear nations.
Rather, it must be emphasized that the regime clearly stipulates the
duty of nuclear powers to act on nuclear disarmament, and includes the
logical necessity or latent possibility of achieving the elimination of
nuclear weapons as well as a vision of a nuclear free world. Although
the 'prohibition and prevention of nuclear proliferation' and the 'duty
to implement nuclear disarmament' are two sides of the same coin, there
is no room for doubt that it is the latter that is the decisive factor
for the survival of the NPT regime. The reason for this is the fact that
non-nuclear nations have only accepted this unfair treaty based on the
assumption that the nuclear nations would faithfully fulfill their duty
of nuclear disarmament, and if that duty is not fulfilled there will be
almost no meaning in continuing with the NPT regime. Yet, [the
**[collapse]{.mark}** of the NPT regime **[would]{.mark}**
**[not]{.mark}** necessarily **[bring]{.mark}** about the chaos and
confusion of immediate and uncontrolled nuclear
**[prolif]{.mark}**eration, nor would this necessarily represent the
worst case scenario. This is [because]{.mark} non-nuclear
[nations]{.mark} that withdraw from the NPT regime would have the option
of [establish]{.mark}ing [a new 'nuclear]{.mark} weapon [prohibition
treaty']{.mark} on their own to put pressure on nuclear nations to
prohibit the preemptive use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear
nations and fulfill their duty to eliminate nuclear weapons in a more
effective manner. The important point here is that it is anticipated
that the majority of non-nuclear [nations that withdraw]{.mark} from the
NPT regime [would not choose]{.mark} to take the path of nuclear
[armament]{.mark} themselves, [but rather]{.mark} on the contrary, they
would [implement]{.mark} [initiatives]{.mark} and efforts [to
**pursue**]{.mark} not only promotion of nuclear
**[non-prolif]{.mark}**eration but also the elimination of nuclear
weapons ever more proactively. This is [evident when one looks
at]{.mark} the **[past activities]{.mark}** and assertions of the member
nations of the New Agenda Coalition or NPT nonmember
nations.]{.underline}

#### The treaty can survive crises

**Timerbaev 17**--- \[retired diplomat Roland Timerbaev, who played a
key role in the treaty negotiations as a member of the Soviet delegation
Interviewed by Anton V. Khlopkov September 2017 \"Roland Timerbaev: The
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty Has Largely Achieved Its Goals,\" Arms
control association,
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2017-09/interviews/roland-timerbaev-nuclear-nonproliferation-treaty-largely-achieved-its-goals>\]

Ambassador Timerbaev, what did you believe were the main goals of the
NPT? Fifty years on, do you think those goals have been achieved?

Timerbaev: [The main goal of the treaty is stated in its name: it is to
prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons. On the whole, that goal
has been achieved]{.underline}. [When the NPT was opened for
signature]{.underline} \[on July 1, 1968\], Soviet and U.S. specialists
thought that [20 to 25 new states could acquire nuclear weapons in the
foreseeable future. Such a scenario has been averted largely thanks to
the NPT]{.underline}. As you know, [only eight countries currently
possess such weapons]{.underline} \[the five official nuclear-weapon
states plus India, Israel, and Pakistan\]. North Korea has also declared
itself a nuclear power.

In this context, [it would be useful to recall several historical
events.]{.underline} First, [[South Africa]{.underline}]{.mark} has
voluntarily relinquished its nuclear arsenal, as confirmed by the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Second, after the breakup of
the Soviet Union, [[Ukrain]{.mark}e]{.underline} attempted to claim
nuclear power status because a large part of the Soviet nuclear arsenal
was located on Ukrainian territory. It took a lot of effort to persuade
Kiev to relinquish its nuclear ambitions, return all nuclear warheads to
Russia, and join the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon state. The third case I
would like to cite is [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the basis of a
deal adopted in 2015, Iran has undertaken to limit the scale and scope
of its nuclear program. At the same time, Iranian scientists continue
their nuclear research in accordance with the right of every NPT member
to peaceful use of nuclear energy, as stipulated in Article IV of the
NPT.

The NPT's [Article VI sets the objective of launching the process of
nuclear disarmament]{.underline}. [The nuclear-weapon states have
undertaken a commitment to that effect by joining the NPT.
According]{.underline} to the latest assessments[, over the past 25
years [the combined nuclear arsenals]{.mark} of the nuclear-weapon
states, mainly Russia and the United States, [have been reduced by a
factor of five or six]{.mark} compared to the peak Cold War
levels.]{.underline} However, the situation with Article VI is not free
of contention. I believe that the topic of nuclear disarmament is
extremely important in the context of discussing the future of the NPT
and the entire global nuclear order, so I would like to return to it
later on.

Certain vulnerabilities of the NPT have come to light over the almost
five decades since its opening for signature, I mean, first and
foremost, the withdrawal of \[North Korea\] from the treaty. I visited
Pyongyang in the early 1980s to persuade the North Korean diplomats of
the need for their country to join the NPT. In 1985, North Korea joined
the treaty, but 18 years later it announced its final withdrawal. It
then stepped up its nuclear program and has since conducted five nuclear
tests.

Have you identified any other vulnerabilities of the NPT? What is the
nature of those vulnerabilities? Are they inherent to the nature of the
treaty itself, which was drawn up in the geopolitical circumstances that
existed at the time, or do they manifest only in the absence of
political will to force certain states to abide strictly by their NPT
commitments?

I would say there are two other vulnerabilities, both lying within the
text of the treaty itself. Early efforts to draft the NPT began in New
York in 1966 in a bilateral format between the Soviet Union and the
United States. At the time, the Committee of Disarmament, or the
Eighteen-Nation Committee \[on Disarmament\] as it was known at the
time, was not involved in \[the\] negotiations process in any form. In
New York, we managed to agree on the wording of Articles I and II. But
we never planned to incorporate Articles IV and VI in their current
shape into the treaty, and I believe these two articles to be the
weakest of all.

Under Article VI, states are obliged to pursue disarmament negotiations
"in good faith." The initial draft of that article was proposed by
Egypt, or rather by the entity then known as the United Arab Republic.
Later on, other non-nuclear-weapon states joined in. There was another
draft introduced by Mexico, listing practical measures that were not
limited to disarmament. It was proposed, for example, to include \[a\]
nuclear test ban and prohibition of the production of nuclear materials
in the scope of the treaty. Using the Mexican draft as a starting point,
the Soviet Union and the United States then presented an alternative
version of Article VI. There were people in Moscow, such as Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko and his first deputy, Vasily Kuznetsov, who
argued that at least some of the practical measures proposed by the
non-nuclear-weapon states should be added in the final text of the NPT.
But the United States, namely U.S. Ambassador to the UN Arthur Goldberg,
insisted that these details should be left out of Article VI, and
eventually they prevailed.

Starting from the 1960s, [[a series of bilateral]{.mark} and
multilateral [documents]{.mark} that had to do [with]{.mark} nuclear
disarmament and nuclear [threat reduction were signed]{.mark}. They were
aimed, one way or another, at facilitating the implementation of Article
VI]{.underline}. Of course, there were also several pauses in that
process, but up until 2010, negotiations were fairly regular, and a lot
of work had been done on reducing nuclear arsenals. But seven years ago,
that process ground to a halt. It is quite telling that, during the
latest meeting between the Russian and U.S. presidents at the \[Group of
Twenty\] summit on July 7, 2017, these issues were not even discussed,
to the best of my knowledge. Regular dialogue between our two countries
on nuclear disarmament issues should be resumed, and other
nuclear-weapon states should also become involved. The current state of
affairs and the discussions on the nuclear disarmament issue have, in
many ways, become hostage to the wording used in Article VI.

Article IV, the one on peaceful use of nuclear energy, was one of the
key incentives for signing the NPT for many non-nuclear-weapon states.
Its main shortcoming is that it does not say exactly how parties to the
treaty should facilitate peaceful use of nuclear energy in other
counties. So the question is, What is meant by "facilitate"? Take, for
example, exports of uranium-enrichment equipment, including gas
centrifuges. Should such equipment be supplied to non-nuclear-weapon
states? Since Article IV is not specific in that regard, there are
different interpretations of its text, especially since drawing a clear
distinction between peaceful and military use of nuclear technologies is
an impossible task.

Incidentally, recently declassified British archives contain documents
showing that, during the NPT negotiations, the British tried to get the
U.S. delegation to raise the enrichment issue. In particular, they
argued that it would be very dangerous to leave a window of opportunity
for supplying such equipment, and they wanted this to be somehow
reflected in the treaty. But the U.S. delegation was confident at the
time that the non-nuclear-weapon states would never manage to develop
such an advanced technology, so they decided not to complicate the
negotiations by this additional matter. Frankly, I am not at all sure
how the Soviet delegation would react if the British or the Americans
were to approach us with the proposal to include a clause in the NPT to
the effect that assistance to third countries can be provided only in
"nonsensitive" areas.

Speaking of the current situation in the nuclear industry, we cannot
ignore the fact that global attitudes \[toward\] nuclear power are
changing. The latest example is France, where nuclear power accounts for
over 70 percent of all electricity generation. The French are gradually
beginning to reduce the share of nuclear in their energy mix. They are
aiming for 50 percent. Germany is going to abandon nuclear energy
completely in the coming years; it will keep only several nuclear
research facilities to continue the production of medical isotopes.
Other countries may well follow suit. That is another factor that will
affect the global nuclear order in the longer term.

Was the signing of the NPT inevitable? What prompted the beginning of
the NPT talks in earnest?

I think that the change of attitude \[toward\] nuclear weapons and the
idea of signing the NPT had much to do with the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis. Up until that moment, the only senior politician who had raised
the nuclear nonproliferation issue on the international stage was the
then-foreign minister of Ireland, Frank Aiken. In 1958, four years
before the Cuban missile crisis, he introduced a draft resolution to
that effect at the First Committee of the UN General Assembly.1 On the
whole, the initiative earned some support, but no practical steps were
taken to implement it. Incidentally, Minister Aiken later visited Moscow
in 1968 for the NPT signing ceremony.

But the 1962 crisis was the trigger that prompted a widespread change
with regard to this issue. Humankind was faced with a crisis that could
end in a global catastrophe. It is after that crisis the negotiations on
the nuclear weapons problem began in earnest. In the summer of 1963, a
few months after the Cuban missile crisis was resolved, U.S. President
John Kennedy gave a speech in which he outlined \[the\] importance of
Moscow and Washington working together to prevent "the further spread of
nuclear arms."2 Fairly quickly, in about a month's time, \[Soviet
leader\] Nikita Khrushchev and the Soviet government gave their own
backing to the idea; and in another four or six weeks, on August 5,
1963, the parties signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Then came
the turn for the NPT.

A change of attitude \[toward\] nuclear weapons also manifested itself
in NATO's cancellation of its earlier plans to create a nuclear-armed
multilateral force (MLNF) and the Atlantic Nuclear Force (ANF).3 The
alliance came to realize that such a plan did not sit well with the
state of international relations at the time.4

What do you think was the point of no return during the talks, the event
after which the signing of the treaty became just a matter of time?

I think that point came when the United States and the Soviet Union
reached an agreement in New York in 1966 on Articles I and II. These
articles were the constants around which the entire architecture of the
treaty revolved. They became part of the NPT in their original form
agreed in New York.

You have already mentioned that the NPT talks began in a bilateral
Soviet-U.S. format. Who do you think played the key role in Moscow and
Washington in making the treaty happen?

I believe they were, first and foremost, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson
and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko. I once found in Johnson's archives
his correspondence with his aides who were in charge of the NPT talks at
the White House. I was amazed at how closely and personally involved the
U.S. president was in the details of the talks and by the degree of
consensus on this issue among the key White House staff. At the same
time, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk opposed the NPT, but Johnson had
his way in the end.

Meanwhile, Gromyko did his best to persuade the Politburo. The
negotiating process was happening simultaneously with the NATO
initiatives on establishing the MLNF and ANF. NATO had also established
the so-called Nuclear Planning Committee (the McNamara Committee). The
Soviet Foreign Ministry and the minister himself therefore had to work
very hard to secure Soviet interagency support for the NPT.

Incidentally, the body responsible for making NATO nuclear policy
decisions, which is now called the Nuclear Planning Group, de facto
continues to exist. This gives a pretext to some politicians and
officials to interpret the NPT in a way that allows bloc participation
in nuclear issues. That is a mistaken interpretation. Joint nuclear
missions by NATO members, or "nuclear sharing," are prohibited by the
treaty.

Looking back at the 50-year history of the treaty, how resilient has it
been in various nuclear nonproliferation crises?

[The [NPT is the cornerstone of the global nuclear
order]{.mark}]{.underline}. The examples of South Africa and Iran
demonstrate that [[the treaty can successfully overcome various
crises]{.underline}.]{.mark} At the beginning of our conversation, I
mentioned that the settlement of those particular crises was achieved on
the basis of the principles and provisions of the NPT. I hope this will
continue to be the case in the future.

Proliferation, after all, means rapid spread. And whereas nuclear
weapons have proliferated "vertically", with existing nuclear states
adding to their existing nuclear arsenals, **[[there has not

proliferation as if it was a matter of fact]{.underline}. **[[Reality

states]{.underline} in the world [with nuclear weapons]{.underline}
among the UN's 193 members: the US (since 1945), Russia (since 1949),
the UK (since 1952), France (since 1960), China (since 1964), Israel
(since 1966, unofficial), India (since 1974), Pakistan (since 1998) and
North Korea (since 2006). Other [countries have dropped off the
list]{.underline}. [[South Africa]{.underline}]{.mark} joined the
nuclear club in the 1980s, but [[dismantled]{.underline}]{.mark} its
weapons in the early 1990s. [[Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine]{.mark}
i]{.underline}nherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union when they
became independent states after the Cold War, but they
[[transferred]{.mark} their nuclear arsenal to Russia]{.underline} in
the 1990s. In other words, only a handful of countries in Europe, Asia
and North America possess these weapons, while Africa, Australasia and
Latin America are devoid of nuclear weapons states. In fact, [[the
number]{.mark} of nuclear weapons states [has]{.mark} [actually
decreased]{.mark} ever since the 1990s]{.underline}. [And even
though]{.underline} the Pakistani nuclear weapons scientist Abdul Qadeer
Khan confirmed [the existence of a global nuclear]{.underline} [black
market]{.underline} which purportedly provided nuclear technology,
expertise, and designs to various countries, including Libya, [no
horizontal nuclear weapons proliferation has taken place.]{.underline}
[Libya]{.underline} eventually voluntarily [renounced its secret nuclear
weapons]{.underline} [efforts]{.underline} in December 2003.
[[Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan]{.mark} have also
[shelved]{.mark} their nuclear weapons programs]{.underline}. As of now,
there are 31 countries with nuclear power plant units in operation;
countries such as Australia, Canada, and Japan are widely believed to
have the technological sophistication to become nuclear weapons states
in relatively short amount of time should they want to -- but they have
not pursued that path. In other words, [even though there have been

**[[such]{.mark} [a development has not

[But there\'s [one problem with]{.mark} this [\"nuclear domino\"]{.mark}
scenario[: the **historical record** does not support
it]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the dawn of the nuclear age,
[[many]{.mark} have [fear]{.mark}ed [rapid]{.mark} and widespread
nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}; [[65 years later, **only
nine** countries have]{.mark} developed nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nearly 20 years elapsed between the
emergence of the first nuclear state, the United States, in 1945, and
the fifth, China, in 1964.¶ The [next 40 years gave birth to only
five]{.underline} additional [nuclear countries]{.underline}: India,
Israel, South Africa, Pakistan, and North Korea. South Africa
voluntarily disarmed in the 1990s, as did Belarus, Kazakhstan, and
Ukraine following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. [[After
Israel]{.underline} [developed]{.underline}]{.mark} a [nuclear
weapons]{.underline} capability in the late 1960s, **[[no regional
nuclear chain reaction followed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even though the
country is surrounded by rivals[. Nor was there even a two-country
nuclear arms race in the region]{.underline}.¶ Similarly[, it has now
been four years since [North Korea became a nuclear weapons state, yet
South Korea and Japan have **not followed suit**]{.mark}, despite the
fact that they have a latent nuclear weapons capability]{.underline} \--
access to the fissile material necessary for nuclear weapons. These
countries\' decisions to not go nuclear are largely [thanks
to]{.underline} extensive U.S. efforts to dissuade them. Both South
Korea and Japan enjoy firm and long-standing security assurances from
Washington, [including protection under the U.S.]{.underline} strategic
nuclear [umbrella]{.underline}, obviating the need for their own
deterrents.

The other camp, which is quite tiny, consists of proliferation
sanguinists who maintain that, on balance, [a certain amount of
proliferation might actually enhance international stability by
deterring war or warlike adventures]{.underline}.5 However, there is
another possible approach to the proliferation issue that might be
called irrelevantist. People in this near-empty camp stress two
considerations: First, [**[it]{.mark} really [doesn't]{.mark} bloody
well [matter]{.mark}** [whether the bomb proliferates]{.mark} or not:
proliferation has been of little consequence]{.underline} (except on
agonies, obsessions, rhetoric, posturing, and spending), [and no country
that has possessed the weapons has found them useful or
beneficial]{.underline}, nor have those who abandoned them suffered loss
because of this. Thus, [the [consequences]{.mark} of such proliferation
that has taken place [have been]{.mark} substantially
[benign]{.mark}]{.underline}: those who have acquired the weapons have
"used" them simply to stoke their egos or to deter real or imagined
threats. Second, alarmed efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear
weapons have proved to be very costly, leading to the deaths of more
people than perished at Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. This chapter
evaluates these two irrelevantist considerations.6 The Benign
Consequences of Proliferation Although we have now suffered through
two-thirds of a century characterized by alarmism about the disasters
inherent in nuclear proliferation[, the substantive consequences of
proliferation have been quite limited]{.underline}. **[Military
Value]{.underline}** Although the weapons have certainly generated
obsession and have greatly affected military spending, diplomatic
posturing, and ingenious theorizing, [the few countries to which the
weapons have proliferated have for the most part found them a notable
waste of time, money, effort, and scientific talent]{.underline}. [They
have quietly kept them in storage and haven't even found much benefit in
rattling them from time to time]{.underline}. [There has never been a
militarily compelling---or even minimally sensible---reason to use
nuclear weapons, particularly because of an inability to identify
suitable targets or ones that could not be attacked as effectively by
conventional munitions]{.underline}. And it is difficult to see how
nuclear weapons benefited their possessors in specific military
ventures. Israel's presumed nuclear weapons did not restrain the Arabs
from attacking in 1973, nor did Britain's prevent Argentina's seizure of
the Falklands in 1982. Similarly, the tens of thousands of nuclear
weapons in the arsenals of the enveloping allied forces did not cause
Saddam Hussein to order his occupying forces out of Kuwait in 1990. Nor
did possession of the bomb benefit America in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, or
Afghanistan; France in Algeria; or the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.7
**[Domination Proliferation]{.underline}** alarmists may occasionally
grant that countries principally obtain a nuclear arsenal to counter
real or perceived threats, but many go on to argue that the newly
nuclear country will then use its nuclear weapons to "dominate" the
area. That argument was repeatedly used with dramatic urgency before
2003 for the dangers supposedly posed by Saddam Hussein, and it has also
been frequently applied to Iran. Exactly how that domination business is
to be carried out is never made clear.8 But the notion, apparently, is
that should an atomic Iraq (in earlier fantasies) or North Korea or Iran
(in present ones) rattle the occasional rocket, other countries in the
area, suitably intimidated, would supinely bow to its demands. Far more
likely, [any [threatened states]{.mark} will [make common cause]{.mark}
with each other and with other concerned countries against the
threatening neighbor]{.underline}. It seems overwhelmingly likely that
[[if a nuclear Iran brandishes]{.mark} its weapons]{.underline} to
intimidate others or to get its way, it will find that [[those
threatened]{.underline}]{.mark}, rather than capitulating to its
blandishments or rushing off to build a compensating arsenal of their
own, [will [ally]{.mark} with others to stand up to the
intimidation]{.underline}---rather in the way they coalesced into an
alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. [It
is also argued that nuclear weapons embolden a country to do mischief
with less fear of punishing consequences. However, coun-tries like Iran
already seem about as free as they need to be to do
mischief]{.underline} (from the U.S. standpoint) in the Middle East [and
[rogue states]{.mark}]{.underline} like the USSR, China, and North Korea
[[do not]{.mark} seem to have [stepp]{.mark}ed [up]{.mark} their
[mischief after]{.mark} gaining [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[Deterrence]{.underline}** Although there are conceivable conditions
under which nuclear weapons could serve a deterrent function, it is
questionable whether they have yet ever done so. In particular, it is
far from clear that nuclear weapons are what kept the Cold War from
becoming a hot one. The people who have been in charge of world affairs
since World War II have been the same people or the intellectual heirs
of the people who tried assiduously, frantically, desperately, and, as
it turned out, pathetically, to prevent World War II, and when, despite
their best efforts, world war was forced upon them, they found the
experience to be incredibly horrible, just as they had anticipated. On
the face of it, to expect these countries somehow to allow themselves to
tumble into anything resembling a repetition of that
experience---whether embellished with nuclear weapons or not---seems
almost bizarre. [The people running world politics since 1945 have had
plenty of disagreements, but they have not been so obtuse]{.underline},
depraved, flaky, or desperate [as to need visions of mushroom clouds to
conclude that another world war, nuclear or non-nuclear, win or lose,
could be decidedly unpleasant]{.underline}.9 Moreover, each leak from
the archives suggests that the Soviet Union never seriously considered
any sort of direct military aggression against the United States or
Europe. Thus, Robert Jervis: "The Soviet archives have yet to reveal any
serious plans for unprovoked aggression against Western Europe, not to
mention a first strike against the United States." Vojtech Mastny: "The
strategy of nuclear deterrence \[was\] irrelevant to deterring a major
war that the enemy did not wish to launch in the first place....All
Warsaw Pact scenarios presumed a war started by NATO." Stephen Ambrose:
"At no time did the Red Army contemplate, much less plan for, an
offensive against West Europe." According to Bernard Brodie, "It is
difficult to discover what meaningful incentives the Russians might have
for attempting to conquer Western Europe." And George Kennan: "I have
never believed that they have seen it as in their interests to overrun
Western Europe militarily, or that they would have launched an attack on
that region generally even if the so-called nuclear deterrent had not
existed."10 As Kennan suggests, given the Soviets' global game plan,
which stressed revolutionary upheaval and subversion from within, not
Hitlerian conquest, and given their experience with two disastrous world
wars, another such experience scarcely made any sense whatever. That is,
there was nothing to deter. **[Status Symbols]{.underline}** Moreover,
the weapons have not proved to be crucial status---or
virility---symbols. French President Charles de Gaulle did opine in 1965
that "no country without an atom bomb could properly consider itself
independent," and Robert Gilpin concluded that "the possession of
nuclear weapons largely determines a nation's rank in the hierarchy of
international prestige."11 In Gilpinian tradition, some analysts who
describe themselves as "realists" have insisted for years that Germany
and Japan must soon come to their senses and quest after nuclear
weapons.12 As Jervis has observed however, "India, China, and Israel may
have decreased the chance of direct attack by developing nuclear
weapons, but it is hard to argue that they have increased their general
prestige or influence."13 And, as Jenifer Mackby and Walter Slocombe
note: Undoubtedly some countries have pursued nuclear weapons more for
status than for security. However, Germany, like its erstwhile Axis
ally, Japan, has become powerful because of its economic might rather
than its military might, and its renunciation of nuclear weapons may
even have reinforced its prestige. It has even managed to achieve its
principal international objective---reunification---without becoming a
nuclear state.14 How much more status would Japan have if it possessed
nuclear weapons? Would anybody pay a great deal more attention to
Britain or France if their arsenals held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or would
anybody pay much less if they had none? Did China need nuclear weapons
to impress the world with its economic growth? Or with its Olympics?
**[Pace of Proliferation]{.underline}** These considerations help
explain why **[[alarmists have been wrong]{.mark} for decades
[about]{.mark} the [pace]{.mark} of nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}**. [Dozens of technologically capable
countries have considered obtaining nuclear arsenals, but very few have
done so]{.underline}. Indeed, as Jacques Hymans has pointed out, even
supposedly optimistic forecasts about nuclear dispersion have proved to
be too pessimistic.15 Thus, [in 1958 the N]{.underline}ational
[P]{.underline}lanning [A]{.underline}ssociation [predicted "a rapid
rise in the number of atomic powers ... by the
mid-1960s]{.underline}."16 A few years later C. P. Snow sternly
predicted, "Within, at the most, six years, China and several other
states \[will\] have a stock of nuclear bombs" while U.S. President John
[Kennedy observed that there might be "ten, fifteen, twenty" countries
with a nuclear capacity by 1964]{.underline}. Such punditry has gone
astray in part because the pundits insist on extrapolating from the
wrong cases. A more pertinent prototype would have been Canada, a
country that could easily have had nuclear weapons by the 1960s but
declined to make the effort.18 In fact, over the decades, [a huge number
of [countries capable]{.mark} of developing nuclear weapons have
[neglected]{.mark} even to consider [the
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}---for example, Canada, Italy, and
Norway---even as Argentina, Brazil, Libya, South Korea, and Taiwan have
backed away from or reversed nuclear weapons programs, and Belarus,
Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine have actually surrendered or
dismantled an existing nuclear arsenal.19 Some of that reduction is no
doubt due to the hostility of the nuclear nations, but even without that
the Canadian case seems to have proved to have rather general relevance.
Its experience certainly suggests, as Stephen Meyer has shown, [there is
no "technological imperative" for countries to obtain nuclear weapons
once they have achieved the technical capacity to do so]{.underline}.20
In consequence, [[alarmist predictions about]{.mark} proliferation
chains, cascades, [dominoes]{.mark}]{.underline}, waves, avalanches,
epidemics, and points of no return [have [proved]{.mark} to be
[faulty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Insofar as most
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} of most countries (even rogue ones) have
considered acquiring the weapons, they [have come to [appreciate]{.mark}
several [defects]{.mark}: nuclear weapons are dangerous, distasteful,
costly, and likely to rile the neighbors]{.underline}. Moreover, as
Hymans has demonstrated, [the [weapons have]{.mark} also [been]{.mark}
exceedingly [difficult to obtain]{.mark} for administratively
dysfunctional countries like Iran.]{.underline}21 Potential Dangers Even
if nuclear weapons so far have had little impact, there is an array of
potential (or imagined) dangers that, alarmed antiproliferators suggest,
might come about. **[Crazy Leaders]{.underline}** [[It is]{.mark}
sometimes [said]{.mark}]{.underline}, or implied, that
[[prolif]{.mark}eration [has]{.mark} had [little consequence
because]{.mark} the only [countries]{.mark} to possess nuclear weapons
have [had rational leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But nuclear
weapons]{.mark} have [proliferated to]{.mark} large, important countries
run by unchallenged [monsters]{.mark}]{.underline} who, at the time they
acquired the bombs, were certifiably deranged: Josef
[Stalin]{.underline}, who in 1949 was planning to change the climate of
the Soviet Union by planting a lot of trees, and [Mao]{.underline}
Zedong, who in 1964 had just carried out a bizarre social experiment
that resulted in an artificial famine in which tens of millions of
Chinese perished.22 [It is incumbent on those who strongly oppose an
Iranian bomb to demonstrate that the Iranian regime is daffier than
these]{.underline}. Atomic Terrorism Thus far, [[terrorist
groups]{.mark} seem to [have]{.mark} exhibited only [limited
desire]{.mark} and even less progress [in going
atomic]{.mark}]{.underline}. That lack of action may be because, after a
brief exploration of the possible routes, [they]{.underline}---unlike
generations of alarmists---[have discovered that [the tremendous
effort]{.mark} required [is scarcely]{.mark} likely to be
[successful]{.mark}]{.underline}.23 In the wake of 9/11, however,
concern about the atomic terrorist surged even though the attacks of
that day used no special weapons. By 2003, United Nations Ambassador
John Negroponte judged there to be "a high probability" that within two
years al-Qaeda would attempt an attack using a nuclear weapon or other
weapon of mass destruction. In that spirit Graham Allison published a
book in 2004---over ten years ago---relaying his "considered judgment"
that "on the current path, a nuclear terrorist attack on America in the
decade ahead is more likely than not."24 Allison has quite a bit of
company in his unfulfilled alarmist conclusions. According to Robert
Gates, former secretary of defense, every senior government leader is
kept awake at night by "the thought of a terrorist ending up with a
weapon of mass destruction, especially nuclear."25 And in 2010,
President Barack Obama held the atomic terrorist to be "the single
biggest threat to U.S. security."26 [One route a would-be atomic
terrorist might take would be to receive or buy [a bomb from a]{.mark}
generous, like-minded nuclear [state]{.mark}]{.underline} for delivery
abroad. [That route [is highly improbable]{.mark},]{.underline} however,
[because [there would be too much risk]{.mark}---even for a country led
by extremists---that the ultimate source of the weapon would be
discovered]{.underline}. As one prominent analyst, Matthew Bunn, puts
it, "[A dictator or oligarch bent on maintaining power is highly
unlikely to take the immense risk of transferring such a devastating
capability to terrorists they cannot control, given the ever-present
possibility that the material would be traced back to its
origin]{.underline}."27 [Important in this last consideration are
deterrent safeguards afforded by "nuclear forensics]{.underline}," which
is the rapidly developing science (and art) of connecting nuclear
materials to their sources even after a bomb has been exploded.28
Moreover, [there is a very considerable danger to the donor that the
bomb]{.underline} ([and its source) would be discovered before delivery
or that it would be exploded in a manner and on a target the donor would
not approve of---including on the donor itself]{.underline}. [Another
concern would be that the terrorist group might be infiltrated by
foreign intelligence]{.underline}.29 In addition, almost no one would
trust al-Qaeda. As one observer has pointed out, the terrorist group's
explicit enemies list includes not only Christians and Jews but also all
Middle Eastern regimes; Muslims who don't share its views; most Western
countries; the governments of Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Russia;
most news organizations; the United Nations; and international
nongovernmental organizations.30 Most of the time, al-Qaeda didn't get
along all that well even with its host in Afghanistan, the Taliban
government.31 [There has also been great worry about "[loose
nukes]{.mark}]{.underline}," especially in post-communist
Russia---weapons, "suitcase bombs" in particular, that can be stolen or
bought illicitly. A careful assessment conducted by the Center for
Nonproliferation Studies has concluded that it is unlikely that any of
those devices have been lost and that, regardless, [their effectiveness
[would be]{.mark} very low or even [nonexistent]{.mark} because
[they]{.mark} (like all nuclear weapons) [require]{.mark} continual
[maintenance]{.mark}]{.underline}.32 Even some of those people most
alarmed by the prospect of atomic terrorism have concluded, "It is
probably true that there are no 'loose nukes,' transportable nuclear
weapons missing from their proper storage locations and available for
purchase in some way."33 It might be added that Russia has an intense
interest in controlling any weapons on its territory because it is
likely to be a prime target of any illicit use by terrorist groups,
particularly Chechen ones with whom it has been waging a vicious
on-and-off war for decades. The government of Pakistan, which has been
repeatedly threatened by terrorists, has a similar interest in
controlling its nuclear weapons and material---and scientists. As noted
by Stephen Younger, former head of nuclear weapons research and
development at Los Alamos National Laboratory, "Regardless of what is
reported in the news, all nuclear nations take the security of their
weapons very seriously."34 [Even if a finished bomb were somehow lifted
somewhere, the [loss would]{.mark} soon [be noted and a worldwide
pursuit launched]{.mark}. Moreover, finished [bombs are
outfitted]{.mark} with devices designed [to]{.mark} trigger a
non-nuclear explosion that would [destroy]{.mark} the bomb [if]{.mark}
it were [tampered with]{.mark}. And there are other security techniques:
[Bombs can be kept disassembled]{.mark}]{.underline} with the components
stored in separate high-security vaults, [[and security]{.mark} can be
[organized]{.mark} so that two people and multiple codes are required
not only to use the bomb but also to store, maintain, and deploy
it.]{.underline} If the terrorists seek to enlist (or force) the
services of someone who already knows how to set off the bomb, they
would find, as Younger stresses, that "[[only few]{.mark} people in the
world [have the knowledge]{.mark} to cause an unauthorized detonation of
a nuclear weapon]{.underline}." Weapons designers know how a weapon
works, he explains, but not the multiple types of signals necessary to
set it off, and maintenance personnel are trained in only a limited set
of functions.35 [There could be dangers [in]{.mark} the [chaos]{.mark}
that would emerge if a nuclear state were to fail, collapsing in full
disarray]{.underline}---Pakistan is frequently brought up in this
context and sometimes North Korea as well. However, [even under those
conditions, [nuclear weapons would]{.mark} likely [remain under]{.mark}
heavy [guard]{.mark} by people who know that a purloined bomb would most
likely end up going off in their own territory; would still have
locks]{.underline} (and in the case of Pakistan would be disassembled);
[and could probably be followed, located, and hunted down by an alarmed
international community]{.underline}. [The worst-case
scenario]{.underline} in that instance [requires not only a failed state
but also a considerable series of additional permissive
conditions]{.underline}, including consistent (and perfect) insider
complicity and a sequence of hasty, opportunistic decisions or
developments [that click flawlessly in a manner far more familiar to
Hollywood scriptwriters than to people experienced with
reality]{.underline}.36 Accidental or Inadvertent [Detonation [A common
concern has been]{.mark} that the weapons would somehow go off, by
[accident or miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}, devastating the planet
in the process. In 1960, a top nuclear strategist declared it "most
unlikely" that the world could live with an uncontrolled arms race for
decades.37 And in 1979, political scientist Hans J. Morgenthau declared:
"The world is moving ineluctably towards a third world war---a strategic
nuclear war. I do not believe that anything can be done to prevent it.
The international system is simply too unstable to survive for long."38
And Eric Schlosser remains deeply concerned about that danger today.39
In a 1982 New Yorker essay and best-selling book, both titled The Fate
of the Earth, Jonathan Schell passionately, if repetitively, argued the
not entirely novel proposition that nuclear war would be terrible, and
he concluded ominously: "One day---and it is hard to believe that it
will not be soon---we will make our choice. Either we will sink into the
final coma and end it all or, as I trust and believe, we will awaken to
the truth of our peril... and rise up to cleanse the earth of nuclear
weapons."40 As it happened, both options were avoided: Neither final
coma nor nuclear cleansing ever took place. [The common alarmist
[prognostications]{.mark} assuming that because the weapons exist,
sooner or later one or more of them will necessarily go off has now
[failed]{.mark} to deliver [for 70 years,]{.mark} and this suggests that
[something more than luck is operating]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Costly
Consequences of Antiproliferation Policies Although **[the consequences
of nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [have proved]{.mark} to be
substantially [benign]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the same cannot be said
for the consequences of the nuclear antiproliferation quest. The
perpetual agony over nuclear proliferation has resulted in an obsessive
effort to prevent or channel it, and it is this effort, not
proliferation itself, that has inflicted severe costs.

**Keck 13** (Zachary, Associate Editor of The Diplomat, 12/4/13, "Why
Nuclear Weapons Don\'t Spread (Quickly)", The Diplomat,
http://thediplomat.com/2013/12/why-nuclear-weapons-dont-spread-quickly/)

Cartwright is hardly alone in holding these views. Indeed, the general
consensus when it comes to nuclear weapons has long been "when there's a
will there's a way." And yet, [the [spread of nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [has]{.mark} always [been]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[surprisingly [slow]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover,
[[despite]{.mark} the]{.underline} [[diffusion of]{.underline}]{.mark}
nuclear [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, [nuclear weapons
have]{.underline} actually [been]{.underline} [spreading]{.underline}
[much more slowly than they did during the first]{.underline} [few
decades of the nuclear era.]{.underline}

Consider that, [in the three decades following]{.underline} the atomic
bombings of [Hiroshima and Nagasaki]{.underline}, no less than [seven
countries]{.underline} [developed]{.underline} at least [a nascent
nuclear weapon capability]{.underline}. [[In]{.mark} the]{.underline}
nearly [[four decades]{.mark} since]{.underline}, [only [three
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} --- Pakistan, South Africa, and North
Korea --- [have [developed]{.mark}]{.underline} a nuclear weapons
[[capability]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and [one]{.mark}]{.underline} of
these states --- South Africa --- [voluntarily [dismantled its
arsenal.]{.mark}]{.underline}

So what explains this great nuclear slowdown? Two converging trends seem
to be at work. First, [there has been an]{.underline} **[undeniable
decline]{.underline}** [in the number of states interested in
acquiring]{.underline} nuclear [weapons]{.underline}. Harald
[[Muller]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} Andreas
[[Schmidt]{.underline}]{.mark} have [documented this]{.underline} well.
[In their]{.underline} **[[comprehensive study]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[of states with]{.underline} nuclear [weapons activities
between]{.underline} 19**[45]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
20**[05]{.underline}**, [they [find]{.mark} that]{.underline} "[[states
with nuclear weapons activities]{.mark} were]{.underline} **[always a
minority]{.underline}**, [and today they [are the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[smallest minority]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1945." Specifically,
in 2005 [they identified 10 [states]{.mark} as [having nuclear
weapons]{.mark} activities]{.underline} (including those with nuclear
weapons), [which [constitute]{.mark}d]{.underline} [**[less than six
percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [UN]{.underline}]{.mark}
[members]{.underline}. Today the only non-nuclear weapon state (NNWS)
that might be interested in an atomic weapon is Iran.

The fact that [[states have]{.underline}]{.mark} **[by and large [been
uninterested]{.mark} in nuclear weapons]{.underline}** is somewhat
perplexing from a historic perspective. After all, what other
revolutionary military technology hasn't elicited strong interest from
most states competing in the international system?

At the same time, when one examines the properties of nuclear weapons
more closely, the lack of interest is easier to understand. [Nuclear
weapons]{.underline} have basically [served one purpose]{.underline} for
states possessing them; namely, [they]{.underline} have [deterred
others]{.underline} from challenging that state's survival and other
fundamental interests. But the [nuclear era has]{.underline} also [been
characterized by a sharp decline in warfare]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} today [fewer]{.underline} [states]{.underline}
[face]{.underline} fundamental external [threats]{.underline} to their
existence. Given the high costs of building and maintaining a nuclear
arsenal, it makes little sense to acquire nuclear weapons without such
an existential threat.

While lack of interest explains why some states have renounced nuclear
weapons despite possessing the capability to build them, the
[[difficulty]{.underline} [in building them]{.underline}]{.mark} [has
[prevented]{.mark} others [states]{.mark} [that
seek]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear [[weapons]{.mark} from acquiring
them]{.underline}. [Despite]{.underline} the view that "[where there is
a will there's a way," and]{.underline} a strong sense that
[globalization]{.underline} has exacerbated this, the [historical record
tells]{.underline} [a]{.underline} very [different story.]{.underline}

As Jacques Hymans has pointed out, before 1970 seven countries launched
dedicated nuclear weapon programs and all seven succeeded in an average
of seven years. Since 1970, [ten states have launched dedicated nuclear
weapons [programs]{.mark} and only three]{.underline} have
[succeeded]{.underline} (the jury's still out on Iran).
[These]{.underline} three have [[take]{.underline}]{.mark}n an [average
of [17 years to succeed]{.mark}]{.underline} and [Iran]{.underline}
under the Islamic Republic [has been working towards a]{.underline}
nuclear [weapon]{.underline} capability [for]{.underline} some [three
decades.]{.underline}

Just as [[pundits]{.underline}]{.mark} have [routinely]{.underline}
[[underestimate]{.underline}d]{.mark} [the [difficulty]{.mark} of
building]{.underline} nuclear [weapons]{.underline}, so too do
[they]{.underline} [[grossly]{.mark} [overstate]{.mark} the]{.underline}
[number of [states]{.mark}]{.underline} who are [technically [capable of
building them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both journalists and scholars
regularly cite 40 as the number of non-nuclear weapon states who are
technically capable of building them. This figure is often attributed to
the former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
Mohamed ElBaradei, who said in 2004:

"Some estimates indicate that 40 countries or more now have the know-how
to produce nuclear weapons, which means if they have the required
fissile material --- high enriched uranium or plutonium --- we are
relying primarily on the continued good intentions of these countries."

As Scott Sagan has pointed out, most of those citing ElBaradei omit the
latter part of his statement about having the required fissile material.
But this statement is crucial as only a handful of NNWS are capable of
producing or otherwise procuring fissile material, which is necessary
for a nuclear bomb.

Moreover, thanks in no small part to President Obama's focus on nuclear
security, the [global [availability of fissile material has been
declining]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as]{.mark} the U.S. and]{.underline}
its [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} help [remove fissile material
from]{.underline} some [states while [downsizi]{.mark}ng]{.underline}
the [[stockpiles]{.underline}]{.mark} in many others. Furthermore,

#### [No impact]{.underline} -- prolif empirically doesn't cause war and is slow

**Walt, 12** (Stephen Walt -- Robert and Renée Belfer professor of

"The mother of all worst-case assumptions about Iran",

/posts/2012/11/30/the_mother_of_all_worst_case_assumptions_about_iran)

Yet this \"mother of all assumptions\" is simply asserted and rarely
examined. The obvious question to ask is this: [[did]{.mark} [prior acts
of]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [have]{.mark} the same
[fearsome consequences]{.mark} that Iran hawks now forecast? The answer
is [no]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [the spread of nuclear weapons has
had]{.underline} remarkably [little impact on the]{.underline} [basic
nature of world politics]{.underline} and the ranking of major powers.
[[The main effect]{.mark} of the nuclear revolution [has been]{.mark} to
induce **[greater caution]{.mark}** in the behavior of both those who
possessed the bomb and anyone who had to deal with a nuclear-armed
adversary.]{.underline} [[Prolif]{.mark}eration [has not transformed
weak states into]{.mark} influential [global actors]{.mark}, [has not
given]{.mark} nuclear-armed [states the ability to blackmail]{.mark}
their neighbors or force them to kowtow, **[and it has not
triggered]{.mark}** far-reaching regional **[arms
races]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In short, fears that an Iranian bomb would
transform regional or global politics have been greatly exaggerated; one
might even say that they are just a lot of hooey.¶ [[Consider the
historical record]{.underline}]{.mark}.¶ Did the world turn on its axis
when the mighty Soviet Union tested its first bomb in 1949? Although
alarmist documents like NSC-68 warned of a vast increase in Soviet
influence and aggressiveness, [[Soviet nuclear
developmen]{.mark}t]{.underline} simply
[[reinforced]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[caution]{.underline}]{.mark}
that both superpowers were already displaying towards each other. The
United States already saw the USSR as an enemy, and the basic principles
of containment were already in place. NATO was being formed before the
Soviet test and Soviet dominance of Eastern Europe was already a fait
accompli. Having sole possession of the bomb hadn\'t enabled Truman to
simply dictate to Stalin, and getting the bomb didn\'t enable Stalin or
his successors to blackmail any of their neighbors or key U.S. allies.
[It certainly didn\'t lead any countries to \"reorient their political
alignment]{.underline} toward Moscow.\" Nikita Khrushchev\'s subsequent
missile rattling merely strengthened the cohesion of NATO and other
U.S.-led alliances, and we now know that much of his bluster was
intended to conceal Soviet strategic inferiority. [Having a large
nuclear arsenal didn\'t stop the anti-commnist uprisings in East
Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, or Poland, and didn\'t allow the
Soviet Union to win in Afghanistan. Nor did it prevent the USSR from
eventually collapsing entirely.¶ Did British and French acquisition of
nuclear weapons slow their decline as great powers? Not in the
slightest]{.underline}. Having the force de frappe may have made De
Gaulle feel better about French prestige and having their own deterrent
made both states less dependent on America\'s security umbrella, but it
didn\'t give either state a louder voice in world affairs or win them
new influence anywhere. And you might recall that Britain couldn\'t get
Argentina to give back the Falklands by issuing nuclear threats \-- even
though Argentina had no bomb of its own and no nuclear guarantee \--
they had to go retake the islands with conventional forces. ¶ [[Did
China\'s detonation of a bomb]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1964 suddenly
[[make them a superpower? Hardly]{.mark}.]{.underline} China remained a
minor actor on the world stage until it adopted market principles, and
[its]{.underline} rising global [influence is due to]{.underline} three
decades of economic [growth]{.underline}, [not]{.underline} a pile of
[nukes]{.underline}. And by the way, [did getting a bomb enable
Mao]{.underline} Zedong\--a cruel megalomaniac who launched the
disastrous Great Leap Forward in 1957 and the destructive Cultural
Revolution in the 1960s [\-- to start threatening and blackmailing his
neighbors? Nope.]{.underline} In fact, China\'s foreign policy behavior
after 1964 was generally quite restrained.¶ What about Israel? [[Does
Israel\'s nuclear arsenal allow it to coerce]{.mark} [its
neighbors]{.mark} or impose its will on Hezbollah or the Palestinians?
[No]{.mark}]{.underline}. Israel uses its conventional military
superiority to try to do these things, not its nuclear arsenal. Indeed,
[Israel\'s bomb didn\'t even prevent Egypt and Syria from attacking it
in]{.underline} October [1973]{.underline}, although it did help
convince them to limit their aims to regaining the territory they had
lost in 1967. It is also worth noting [that Israel\'s nuclear program
did not trigger a rapid arms race either.]{.underline} Although states
like Iraq and Libya did establish their own WMD programs after Israel
got the bomb, none of their nuclear efforts moved very rapidly or made
it across the finish line.¶ But wait, there\'s more. [The white
government in South Africa eventually produced a handful of bombs, but
nobody noticed]{.underline} and apartheid ended anyway. Then the new
government gave up its nuclear arsenal to much acclaim. If anything,
South Africa was more secure without an arsenal than it was before.¶
[W[hat about India and Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}? India\'s
\"peaceful nuclear explosion\" in 1974 didn\'t turn it into a global
superpower, and its only real effect was to spur Pakistan \-- which was
already an avowed rival \-- to get one too. And it\'s worth noting that
[[there hasn\'t been a large-scale war]{.mark} between the two countries
[since]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite considerable grievances on both
sides and occasional skirmishes and other provocations.¶ Finally,
[[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark} is as annoying and weird as it has
always been, but [getting nuclear weapons [didn\'t transform
it]{.mark}]{.underline} from an economic basket case into a mighty
regional power [and didn\'t make it more inclined to
misbehave]{.underline}. In fact, [what is most remarkable about North
Korea\'s nuclear program is how little impact it has had on its
neighbors.]{.underline} States like [[Japan and South Korea could go
nuclear very quickly]{.underline}]{.mark} if they wanted to, **[[but
neither has done so]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the six years since North
Korea\'s first nuclear test. ¶ In short, [both theory and history teach
us that getting a nuclear weapon has less impact on a country\'s power
and influence than many believe, and [the slow spread of nuclear weapons
has only modest effects on]{.mark} global and regional
[politics]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}
are good for deterring direct attacks on one\'s homeland, and they
[[induce]{.mark} greater [caution]{.mark} in the minds of national
leaders of all kinds. What they don\'t do is turn weak states into great
powers, they are useless as tools of blackmail, and they cost a lot of
money]{.underline}. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[lead]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[states]{.underline}]{.mark} to worry
more about one\'s intentions and [[to band together]{.underline}]{.mark}
for self-protection. For these reasons, most potential nuclear states
have concluded that getting the bomb isn\'t worth it.¶ But a few
states-and usually those who are worried about being attacked-decide to
go ahead. The good news is that when they do, it has remarkably little
impact on world affairs.

Introduction [Since the]{.underline} invention and [first use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} in 1945, [predictions]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
the [proliferation]{.underline} of these weapons [have]{.underline}
traditionally [been]{.underline} **[overestimating]{.underline}**.1
[Despite]{.underline} all [gloomy forecasts, [only nine
states]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[now]{.underline}adays are
considered to [[possess nuclear]{.mark} weapons]{.underline}: the United
States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, France, Israel, India,
Pakistan and North Korea. Although more states have operated nuclear
weapons programmes at some point in the past 65 years -- some experts
argue that in total 39 states once engaged in nuclear weapons
activities2 -- [most]{.underline} of them sooner or [later **gave
up**]{.underline} their **[ambition]{.underline}** to acquire these
weapons. Especially since the second half of the 1980s the number of
states with nuclear weapons-related activities has become relatively
low.3 Taking into account the historical trends, [it looks like
political and academic [forecasts]{.mark} even nowadays [tend to be
**overemphasizing**]{.mark} **the [risks]{.mark} of further
proliferation**]{.underline} of nuclear weapons [**in the near future**,
for example [by **predicting**]{.mark} **nuclear [domino
effects]{.mark}**]{.underline} if new nuclear weapons powers would arise
and cause other states to develop nuclear weapons as well.4 [The
difficulties in forecasting nuclear weapons proliferation can be
explained by one key factor]{.underline}: [[it is]{.underline}]{.mark}
still **[[unclear]{.mark} among academics and
policymakers]{.underline}** [[why]{.underline}]{.mark} exactly
[[states]{.underline}]{.mark} [[start]{.mark} nuclear weapons
[programmes]{.mark} or refrain from them. What makes nuclear
weapons]{.underline} **[attractive or unattractive]{.underline}** to the
leadership of any state? True, [many theories exist]{.underline}. The
problem with [all]{.underline} existing theories on motivations for
states to acquire or not to acquire nuclear weapons is that [\[have\]
supporting evidence]{.underline} may be found, [but opposing evidence as
well]{.underline}. When studying nuclear weapons (non-)proliferation,
one could consider any state in the world as an individual case, each
with its own international and domestic circumstances, and with all the
changes herein during history. It is, therefore, not surprising that
[specific [explanations]{.mark}]{.underline} of nuclear behaviour
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[repeatedly]{.underline}** considered
**[[inadequate]{.underline}]{.mark}** because they fail to account for
all cases -- currently more than 190 states. Without understanding what
are the motivations of states to aim for or refrain from acquiring
nuclear weapons, it is not only complicated to forecast nuclear
proliferation dynamics, but even more important: it becomes difficult to
develop policies aimed at influencing these dynamics -- there is a risk
of treating the symptoms while ignoring the disease. This article aims
at contributing to answering this key question in the field of nuclear
weapons proliferation: why do states wish for nuclear weapons -- or not?
This will not be achieved by developing a new theory, but by increasing
the insights in the large amount of existing theories on nuclear
proliferation motivations. For this purpose the many theories developed
in the past decades will be grouped into four overarching groups. This
analysis could be helpful to future researchers and policy makers who
got lost in the current richness in theories and their critics. Grouping
existing theories on nuclear (non-)proliferation motivations has, to a
limited extent, been done before. Considering the general lack of
unanimity in this research field, it is not surprising that these
groupings also differ. To give some examples: a rather early study on
proliferation motives by George Quester, dating from 1973, counted three
groups of them: 1) military motives; 2) political motives; and 3)
economic motives.5 Scott Sagan in 1996 also developed a grouping of
three 'models' explaining why states wish to build nuclear weapons: 1)
security; 2) domestic politics; and 3) norms.6 Assembling
(non-)proliferation into four groups is also possible, as study from
2010 by William Potter and Gaukhar Mukhatzhanova, shows. Summarized,
Potter and Mukhatzhanova group all theories on nuclear weapons
(non-)proliferation motivations into these four categories: 1) security;
2) international institutions; 3) international norms; and 4) domestic
circumstances.7 Etel Solingen some years earlier (2007) defined the same
four groups, but also added a fifth one: democracy versus autocracy.8
And to mention only one more possible classification: Joseph Cirincione
in 2007 also defined five motivations for states to pursue or forgo
nuclear weapons: 1) security; 2) prestige; 3) domestic politics; 4)
technology; and 5) economics.9 These are just some examples to show that
not only the amount of theoretical groups differs, but also their
content. Nevertheless, some similarities can be noticed; although not
every author mentions the same motivational factor theories, some
overlap can obviously be noticed. This article groups the existing
theories on motivations for nuclear weapons (non- )acquisition in four
factors: 1) Capabilities; 2) Security; 3) International Norms &
Perceptions; and 4) Domestic Political Context. The article will discuss
what they incorporate (including criticism) and why is chosen to group
them in this manner. In conclusion some implications and recommendations
for further research regarding nuclear (non-)proliferation dynamics will
be presented. Capabilities The first group of incentives and
disincentives for nuclear weapons (non-) proliferation is summarized
here as 'capabilities'. Under this umbrella are brought together both
the technological and economic capabilities of states to develop nuclear
weapons. [Nuclear [weapons are]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**not easy to
develop**]{.mark}, nor are the materials that are required cheap and
commonly available. Technologically and scientifically]{.underline} the
[most challenging]{.underline} and costly [is the production of fissile
materials]{.underline} (highly enriched uranium or plutonium).
[[Transforming]{.underline}]{.mark} the nuclear [[materials]{.mark}
into]{.underline} **[reliable and deliverable weapons]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[another challenge]{.underline}** [that [requires
**highly advanced**]{.mark}]{.underline} technological
**[[expertise]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [the same]{.underline} applies
[to]{.underline} developing the [delivery systems]{.underline} for the
weapons -- in this regard, nowadays states generally prefer ballistic
missiles.10 It is often argued that [the technological and [financial
capabilities]{.mark} required]{.underline} for developing nuclear
weapons [[are an]{.underline} **[effective
barrier]{.underline}**]{.mark} [especially to]{.underline} **[less
developed countries]{.underline}** without an advanced scientific and
technological infrastructure and without the financial strength to
afford the investments needed to start a nuclear weapons programme.11
Since Pakistan and North Korea -- both relatively poor countries --
acquired nuclear weapons in 1998 respectively 2006, this argument has
generally faded away from the debate. Actually, the theoretical
assumption that capabilities influence the motivation of states to
pursue or forgo nuclear weapons, is fading away itself from the academic
debate since, approximately, the early 1990s. The capabilities theory is
dating back from the first decades of academic research into nuclear
motivations and gradually became less popular. In the first decades of
nuclear weapons existence, it was generally assumed that any state would
like to have nuclear weapons, simply because these weapons were the most
advanced and powerful military tools available. Stephen Meyer in 1984
summarized the consequences of this assumption as follows: 'If one
presumes that the incentives to acquire nuclear weapons are ever present
-- that all countries would like to have nuclear weapons -- then the
only determining factor becomes technology.'12 One could also describe
the capabilities motivation as a 'why not' principle. When a state has
the means available to build nuclear weapons, why should it refrain?
When it is, for example, rather easy to convert civilian nuclear
technology programmes into military ones, the costs of nuclear weapons
may become relatively low enough that the perceived benefits --
obtaining the most powerful weapons that exist -- easily outweigh the
negative consequences.13 Proponents of the capabilities theory regularly
claim that scientists often play a crucial role in this process. Ralph
Lapp, for example, in 1970 argued that 'research and development has
become an almost unchallenged force in directing the nation to arms. We
may speak of this as technological determinism.'14 Hans Bethe in 1985
also pointed at 'the technological imperative' with regard to nuclear
weapons development, mentioning the feeling among scientists and
government officials 'that we must use this new technology'.15 In this
respect, often an encompassing quotation of Robert Oppenheimer, one of
the founders of the nuclear weapons programme of the United States, is
presented about developing the hydrogen bomb (an improved kind of
nuclear bomb): 'When I saw how to do it, it was clear to me that one had
to at least make the thing. \[\...\] The program in 1951 \[to develop
the H-bomb\] was technically so sweet that you could not argue about
that.'16 The main evidence that the capabilities theory is not
explaining nuclear weapons (non-)proliferation adequately is the fact
that many countries have become technologically and economically able to
develop nuclear weapons, but never did so. The technological 'pull
factor' leading to a wish for nuclear weapons often seems nonexistent,
at least not autonomously. These last two words, 'not autonomously', are
important, because it may be assumed that the capabilities factor is
still important in determining motivations to pursue or forgo nuclear
weapons, even though it may not be a decisive factor on its own. In
certain circumstances, the availability of capabilities to develop
nuclear weapons may compel the leadership of a state to start a nuclear
weapons programme even if it would not have done so when these
capabilities were not available. On the other hand, a [lack of
tech]{.underline}nological [and / or econ]{.underline}omical means [may
force state leaders with a wish for nuclear]{.underline} weapons
[to]{.underline} **[abstain from]{.underline}** starting
**[a]{.underline}** nuclear weapons **[programme]{.underline}** --
although this is still a choice with its own motivations, because it
could always be a possibility to start acquiring the capabilities
needed, even when this requires tough choices on how to spend limited
state budgets.17 In this regard, the [capabilities]{.underline} to
acquire nuclear weapons [may]{.underline} perhaps [be]{.underline}
considered a [necessary, but]{.underline} at itself
[insufficient]{.underline} cause [for]{.underline} nuclear weapons
[prolif]{.underline}eration.18 Even today, there is no unanimity among
scholars on the influence of capabilities on nuclear (non-)proliferation
behaviour by states. A striking example of this lack of unanimity can be
found in one and the same recent book: in an edited volume on nuclear
forecasting, dating from 2010, two contributions come to opposite
conclusions on the capabilities factor. A chapter by Harald Müller and
Andreas Schmidt concludes that the hypothesis that nuclear weapons
proliferation is capability driven ('capability may be defined in
economic or technological terms') cannot be validated at all. The
authors state: '\[\...\] economic factors are almost completely
irrelevant for the initiation of nuclear weapons activities. Rather, it
is a question of political willingness to devote a considerable share of
state's resources to the military sector instead of, say, strengthening
the public welfare program.' And the same applies to technology, they
contend: 'There is no indication at all of a technological pull.'19 In
the same volume, however, Philipp Bleek comes to the complete opposite
conclusion: 'Economic resources and technical capabilities are
powerfully correlated with proliferation proclivity at all levels. More
highly developed states, with access to commensurately greater resources
and technical capabilities, are more likely to explore nuclear weapons
options, launch nuclear weapons programs, and acquire nuclear weapons.
Given how costly and technically challenging nuclear weapons development
is, this is perhaps not a surprising finding; some might even brand it a
resounding reinforcement of conventional wisdom. But it provides robust
evidence to counter those who argue, often citing relatively undeveloped
countries like China and Pakistan that nonetheless proliferated, that
countries' level of development has little to do with their
proliferation proclivity. More highly developed countries proliferate
more readily; less highly developed countries do so less readily.'20
Security The traditionally dominant theory on motivations for states to
pursue nuclear weapons or not has been focussing on security. Since the
beginning of research on dynamics of nuclear (non-)proliferation this
has been by far the most supported factor explaining why states opt for
nuclear weapons. The so-called 'realist' school of thinking -- in the
academic domain of International Relations (IR) in general, but also in
the subfield of (non-)proliferation studies -- considers the world as an
anarchy. In this anarchy, states are in continuous competition and will
only be able to survive as an independent state by 'self-help', which
can be summarized as individualistic behaviour, aiming for its own power
and benefits and thus strengthening its position in comparison with
other states. Following this theory, nuclear weapons are considered to
be the ultimate tool for survival, because these powerful weapons will
provide the best security guarantee against any external aggression. Any
adversary state will think twice before it will attempt to harm the
state in question in any way, because this may ultimately result in the
nuclear destruction of this adversary itself. The only condition for
having a successful nuclear deterrent is that the nuclear weapons
arsenal should be so capacious that it cannot be totally destroyed by a
surprise attack.21 When this realist theory is strictly applied, the
conclusion should be that actually all states wish for nuclear weapons
to be able to ensure their survival within the current international
anarchic system. This may, in the end, be the case, but [most realist
thinkers agree that developing]{.underline} nuclear [weapons is not
easy, cheap or without risk]{.underline}. This has culminated into a
broadly supported nuance of the theory, acknowledging that [[only states
with **actual, pressing**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[security
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline}** [will]{.underline} actively [[pursue
nuclear]{.mark} weapons]{.underline}.22 Especially the risk calculation
factor is often used to explain why most states so far did not develop
nuclear weapons. This explanation is necessary to defend the theory
against its critics who state that [the realist view cannot explain why
**so few states** did actually obtain nuclear weapons]{.underline},
[considering that]{.underline} ultimately [all states would want
to]{.underline} have them and many of the non-acquiring states have
been, or still are, facing obvious security problems. Realist thinkers
generally refute this critique by arguing that [it is not]{.underline}
being [claimed that]{.underline} [acquisition of nuclear weapons is
always the best way to improve]{.underline} a state's
[security]{.underline}. [Sometimes [acquiring]{.mark} nuclear weapons
[may be a **bigger threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} a state's [[security]{.underline}]{.mark} then
to forgo them, [because a]{.underline} nuclear weapons [programme may
cause more distrust and tension among (potential)
adversaries]{.underline} than would be the case without a nuclear
weapons programme. An adversary state may feel so threatened by the
nuclear weapons programme that it will launch a military attack to
prevent its adversary from acquiring them. Even more, the adversary
state may react by developing nuclear weapons itself, thus creating a
nuclear arms race and causing even more insecurity and instability in
the region. When this may be expected, realists claim, states often
refrain from starting a nuclear weapons programme.23 T.V. Paul labels
this 'prudential realism'. In his words, this is a 'soft realist
version' acknowledging that 'nations under certain circumstances may
prudently forgo military capabilities that other states see as
threatening. \[\...\] States are security-conscious entities, but their
military policies are driven by 'most probable threat' assessments, as
opposed to the worst-case assessments offered by hard realism.'24
Moreover, some more nuanced realist approaches also try to explain the
small percentage of states actually aiming for nuclear weapons by adding
levels of insecurity into the theory. From this point of view, states
that are involved in an intense and / or longstanding conflict will aim
for nuclear weapons more easily then states within a lowintensity
conflict and / or a relatively short period of insecurity.25 On the
other hand, many examples can be found of states in intense conflict
situations that never started a nuclear weapons programme. This, in
turn, may be explained by an important variant of the realist school of
thinking, which emphasizes the importance of security alliances. This
variant has been one of the most supported theories for explaining
nuclear (non-)proliferation during the Cold War -- and even up to now
many analysts favour the alliance explanation to account for nuclear
(non-)proliferation dynamics. Instead of developing nuclear weapons to
assure their security, proponents of this theory argue, states may also
choose another option: seeking for an alliance with a nuclear weapons
state that is willing to promise nuclear retaliation in case the
nonnuclear ally will be (nuclear) attacked. This kind of security
guarantee, often called a 'nuclear umbrella' or 'positive security
assurance' makes a national nuclear weapons programme less necessary and
the costs, difficulties, and risks associated with it can be avoided.
The promise of retaliation by the nuclear armed ally functions as
extended deterrence towards possible enemies.26 Critics of this alliance
theory question the credibility of these extended deterrence guarantees.
Extended deterrence may be more or less credible when it functions as
deterrence against (overwhelming) conventional military threats, but
would any nuclear weapons state risk nuclear warfare because of
assisting a non-nuclear ally after an attack by another nuclear weapons
state?27 Joseph Cirincione summarizes this credibility problem as
follows: 'National leaders will continue to ask themselves: 'Would the
President of the United States risk Washington to protect my capital
city?''28 Moreover, the reliance on nuclear-armed allies seems to
contradict the base realist assumption of self-reliance. Jacques Hymans
formulates this contradiction in this way: 'At the very core of realism
lies the notion that friends today may become enemies tomorrow. \[\...\]
Thus, the dominant strategy of states is to go for the bomb themselves
and thus avoid any pleasant surprises.'29 The so-called Neo-realist
theory, developed since the 1970s, combines the importance of security
guarantees with the dimension of the international system: whether this
system is unipolar, bipolar, or multipolar will influence the value of
security guarantees. In a bipolar world like the Cold War era,
neo-realists claim, security guarantees by one of the two superpowers
will generally solve any security concern of other states. In a
multipolar world, which arose after the end of the Cold War, the
stabilizing role of security guarantees by superpowers is loosened
because these superpowers themselves have become relatively less
powerful.30 In a multipolar world states tend to start their own nuclear
weapons programme more easily. Neo-realists nowadays have to admit,
however, that the number of newly started nuclear programmes after the
end of the Cold War has not been that impressive. Another rather modern
realist way to defend the security motivation as principal factor
explaining nuclear (non-)proliferation against its critics, has been the
'opaque proliferation' discussion.31 Especially since the 1990s the
concept of 'opacity', 'latency', or 'ambiguity' has become more popular
in nuclear proliferation studies. Especially realist thinkers turn
around the argument that many states are able to build nuclear weapons,
but never did so. They contend that several of these nuclear weapons
capable states did, indeed, never develop nuclear weapons up to their
final stage -- in the end resulting in testing them -- but that they in
fact developed nuclear weapons without testing them, or at least
developed the means to be able to build nuclear weapons in a very short
timeframe. This is also called 'threshold capacity' -- it takes little
time to pass the threshold of nuclear weapons possession. This way,
there are more nuclear weapons states in the world then is usually
assumed. This assumption can be used to refute the criticism on the
realist view on nuclear (non-)proliferation motivations.32 An additional
phenomenon regarding the security imperative which is sometimes
mentioned by academics is that nuclear weapons may provide deterrence
against larger states and / or groups of states, but not necessarily
against smaller, non-nuclear enemies. In this regard, much-mentioned
examples of non-nuclear parties that waged war against nuclear weapons
states are Vietnam against the United States, Chechnya against the
Russian Federation, and Argentina against the United Kingdom (during the
Falklands War). Apparently, nuclear weapons are not a hundred percent
reliable security guarantee against any military attacks.33 One may even
argue, as Robert Rothstein did in 1966, that the argument that nuclear
weapons offer security is hard to prove at all. Rothstein writes that
'It is the impact of nuclear weapons which is most ambiguous and
uncertain. Presumably they are designed to deter any enemy from
aggressive actions. But in the circumstances we can only be sure when
they fail, for the relationship between successful deterrence and
nuclear weapons is hardly clear. Obviously the enemy might never have
intended to attack at all or, conversely, could have intended to attack
but been deterred by other factors present in the situation. The
security argument is thus entirely hypothetical. It concerns what the
defender thinks he has achieved in felt security, not what he actually
has achieved.'34 Recent research by Ward Wilson also concludes that
there is no evidence in history that nuclear weapons deter enemies to
start any conflict: '\[\...\] many people take the peace that's being
experienced over the past sixty years as significant proof of the power
of nuclear deterrence. But there are some problems. First, proving the
something by using the absence of something is tricky. Second, there are
other factors that can adequately account for this period of peace
\[\...\].'35 Last but not least, it should be mentioned that few
researchers completely reject the importance of security considerations
as influencing (non-)proliferation dynamics. Many analysts recognize
that perceptions of external insecurity among state leaderships are a
necessary condition for decisions to start a nuclear weapons programme,
but that this condition alone is inadequate for explaining these
decisions; other motivational factors have to be combined with the
security motive.36 International Norms and Perceptions The third group
of motivations for states to acquire or not acquire nuclear weapons is
in this article titled 'International Norms and Perceptions'. This
cluster consists of various theories focusing on the role of perceptions
among states on the influence that nuclear weapons could have on their
position in the international community. On the one hand, these
perceptions can be influenced by **[[international]{.mark}ly shared
[norms]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [[make]{.mark} the
[acquisition]{.mark} of nuclear weapons [less attractive]{.mark} --
especially those]{.underline} norms institutionalized [in]{.underline}
[international treaties like the]{.underline} Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty ([NPT]{.underline}). On the other hand, some of these perceptions
may make nuclear weapons more favourable, because states may consider
these weapons as increasing their status and prestige. Due to the
nonproliferation norms, however, **[[status and
prestige]{.underline}]{.mark}** [may]{.underline} also [be perceived to
**[increase by foregoing]{.mark} nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. The
literature on norms and perceptions on nuclear (non- )proliferation
dynamics is rather modest37, mostly because this area of research is
relatively young. Although especially prestige as a factor of influence
on (non- )proliferation has been acknowledged early in the nuclear era
already, in-depth research on norms and perceptions as motivational
factors for nuclear weapons has been very limited before the 2000s. The
motivational factor of international norms regarding states' decisions
towards nuclear weapons (non-)acquisition may be classified in several
theoretical schools within the studies of International Relations. Most
authors label the focus on norms as Constructivism38, but when combined
with the norm-setting role of institutions and treaties, it could also
be labelled as Liberalism, Neoliberalism or Neoliberal
Institutionalism.39 Some researchers label it as Utilitarianism.40
Although there is a difference in focus among these theoretical schools,
in this article they are all grouped into the 'International Norms and
Perceptions' factor. This is conceivable because all theories included
in this group are focussing on the normative environment41 for states in
general. It should be noticed that some aspects of Constructivist,
Liberal or Neoliberal theories will be incorporated in the fourth
motivational factor of this article: the Domestic Political Context.
Especially theories on the economic outlook of state leaders are
considered to belong to the (Neo-)Liberalist school as well42, yet this
article considers these particular theories as more domestically driven
(improving the national economy) than to be motivated by a wish to
adhere to international norms. The norms theory in (non-)proliferation
studies claims that decisions regarding nuclear weapons serve important
symbolic functions, depending on the perceived identity of the state (as
well as shaping this identity itself). Decisions in this regard are
determined by deeper norms and beliefs about what is legitimate and
appropriate in international relations. The most significant behavioural
norm regarding nuclear weapons is embodied in the international
non-proliferation regime consisting of several multilateral treaties and
United Nations resolutions, with the almost universal acceptance of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as its core.43 Jacques Hymans
lucidly summarizes the effect of this non-proliferation regime as
follows: 'Most states think of themselves as, and want to be seen as,
good international citizens. Thanks at least in part to the
non-proliferation regime, there is today a widespread acceptance by
states that good international citizens do not build nuclear arsenals.
Therefore, the overwhelming majority of states have in fact not gone
nuclear.'44 A recent publication by Harald Müller and Andreas Schmidt
makes strong claims on the norm-setting impact of the NPT. Before the
NPT entered into force in 1970, they write, more than two-fifths of the
states that possessed the required capability to start nuclear weapons
activities did so. In the meantime, only a fraction of these states
renounced their nuclear programmes. After the NPT altered the normative
environment, however, the situation changed. Since 1970, less than 15
percent of the states that have the capacity to build nuclear weapons
did actually start such a programme. Even more important, they argue, is
that since 1970 almost 70 percent of all states that once started a
nuclear weapons programme ended this programme.45 The authors explain
this phenomenon by three ways in which the emergence of [international
norms influence the behaviour of states]{.underline}. First, the
non-proliferation [[norms changed]{.mark} the **[costs-benefit]{.mark}s
[calculations]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by states]{.underline}. [[Because
of]{.mark} the broad supported non-prolif]{.underline}eration
[regime]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} its [[verification and
export control]{.underline}]{.mark} policies, [[developing
nuclear]{.mark} weapons [will be]{.mark} more **[difficult]{.mark} and
costly**]{.underline} (technically, financially, and politically).
Second, [the international [norms affect]{.mark} the national
[balance]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of power between
groups]{.underline}]{.mark} (within the government as well as the elite
in general) when they differ in opinion on whether or not to develop
nuclear weapons. Third, and [according to]{.underline} [Müller and
Schmidt]{.underline} most importantly, [the international norms **change
the assumptions about what is appropriate state
behaviour**]{.underline}. The emergence of the non-proliferation norms
made clear that [developing nuclear weapons is decisively **not 'what
states do'**]{.underline}, even when faced with, for example, security
problems.46 Other analyses also warn that it is difficult to prove a
causal relationship between support for the NPT and the restraint of
(capable) states to develop nuclear weapons. One might assume, these
experts argue, that states that ratified the NPT simply did not intend
to develop weapons beforehand, instead of signing the NPT under pressure
of the norm while actually wishing for nuclear weapons. One may claim
that states that ratified the NPT are less likely to acquire nuclear
weapons, but it is not clear at all that they are less likely to do so
as a consequence of having ratified the treaty.47 Moreover, critics of
the norms theory put forward that determined proliferators will do
whatever it takes to acquire nuclear weapons and that international
norms are probably the least obstacle. It is hard to prove that the NPT
did stop states from acquiring nuclear weapons, but there are enough
cases to prove that the NPT does not automatically stop states to do so
-- North Korea, Iran and Syria are examples of states that ratified the
NPT but still started a nuclear weapons programme.48 Proponents of the
'opaque proliferation' theory, discussed above, claim that the
non-proliferation regime only made nuclear weapons programmes less
visible because states wishing for these weapons behave even more
secretively than before.49 Contrary to the 'negative' norms regarding
nuclear weapons, also 'positive' norms exist, following which nuclear
weapons offer prestige and great power status. Agatha Wong-Frazer
describes the possession of nuclear weapons as 'a token entitling the
holder to claim a certain major power status'.50 As long as other states
adhere to these 'positive' norms, maybe even without being aware, the
status and prestige of nuclear weapons may offer the possessor more
diplomatic leverage, or, in other words, more enhanced international
bargaining power, towards these states.51 This kind of positive
perceptions of nuclear weapons is regularly labelled as 'symbolism',
because the weapons are not regarded positively because of their actual
usefulness as military weapons, but more because of their symbolic
value. Nuclear weapons are, in the perception of some observers, used to
show how modern, technological advanced, prestigious, powerful, and/or
sovereign the owner state is.52 Just like the non-proliferation norms,
these positive norms regarding nuclear weapons possession are linked to
a state's identity, self-image and (desired) position in the
international community. Karsten Frey names the positive and negative
norms 'the nuclear taboo' and 'the nuclear myth' respectively.53 Some
analysts consider 'mythmakers' as an important factor influencing
nuclear weapons related decisions -- in this article their role will be
discussed in the cluster on the domestic political context. Instead of
using the term 'myths', this article prefers to use the term
'perceptions' for this positive norms on nuclear weapons. 'Myths' have
the connotation of being untrue, while one may argue that nuclear
weapons truly give a state more international standing. Next to prestige
in the sense of great power status and modernity states may also be
motivated to start a nuclear weapons programme just to 'gain attention'.
When a state wants 'to be taken seriously' by other states but has
little to offer, pursuing nuclear weapons will attract attention for
sure -- maybe in a negative way, but still: attention is attention.
Nuclear weapons -- or only the demonstrated intention to acquire them --
may offer states more international status than they would normally
have, which in turn may lead to diplomatic, political and economic
benefits.54 Domestic political context The fourth cluster of factors
influencing nuclear weapons motivations is in this article entitled
'domestic political context'. The grouping of factors under this title
is more or less copied from Philipp Bleek, who uses the terminology of
'domestic politics' for a same kind of cluster.55 The present article
prefers, however, to combine Bleek's terminology with the concept
'domestic context' which is used by William Potter56 , merging it into
'domestic political context'. By adding the word 'political', domestic
factors like culture, geographical situation or technological
capabilities are excluded. This cluster of domestic political context
factors has many dimensions. Although one may criticize the diversity of
this cluster, in fact the various dimensions can all be brought back to
the domestic political situation in any state. The international
situation -- security, treaties, norms -- has nothing to do with it
directly, except maybe for how this situation is perceived and / or
exploited by certain domestic actors. Focussing on domestic political
factors as drivers for decisions to acquire or forgo nuclear weapons is
a relatively new branch of nuclear (non-)proliferation research.
Although the domestic political context is mentioned in some older
literature as (potentially) influential57, the more in-depth research
into this subject dates from the 2000s. Sagan in 1996-1997 had yet to
signal that there existed no well-developed political theory of nuclear
weapons proliferation identifying how these domestic factors actually
may influence decisions in this regard58, but ten years later two
pioneering studies were published by Jacques Hymans and Etel Solingen;
these studies will be described hereafter. Even nowadays, the number of
studies on domestic factors influencing nuclear weapons
(non-)proliferation is quite modest and the need for a more
sophisticated understanding of the domestic context is still being
emphasized in recent literature.59 A factor that is sometimes mentioned
in literature on (non-)proliferation dynamics, but on which no in-depth
research is known, is domestic turmoil that is perceived as threatening
the power of the state leadership. States facing domestic tensions may
use a nuclear weapons programme -- and the international condemning
reactions on it -- as a method of diversion. Nuclear weapons programmes
may respond to, or even bolster, nationalist sentiments and
international negative reactions may cause a 'rallying around the flag'
effect, ending domestic dissensions for some time. By diverting public
attention from unfavourable domestic issues, the regime could strengthen
its position.60 Related to this domestic turmoil aspect, Kurt Campbell
introduced the term 'regime pessimism' as a factor of potential
influence on nuclear weapons proliferation. He argues that especially
'states in decline' tend to consider developing nuclear weapons because
they 'often suffer from a kind of societal insecurity over future
economic and security shortfalls.' Due to this 'regime pessimism' states
may use a nuclear weapons programme to prevent the state sinking into
oblivion or being overshadowed by (regional) rival states.61 Another
factor grouped in this 'domestic political context' cluster is the
regime type of countries. In International Relations studies there
exists a substantial number of studies suggesting that democracies are
less likely to engage in armed conflict against each other compared to
autocracies, and some authors have suggested that this may also be the
case regarding the development of nuclear weapons. Some researchers that
studied this hypothesis conclude that democracies are less likely to
develop nuclear weapons, and they link this trend to the international
norms and perceptions factor. Müller and Schmidt, for example, argue
that '[**[democracies]{.underline}** [show a]{.underline}]{.mark}
[relatively [higher probability to abide]{.mark} by the rule of law
[and]{.mark} to take efforts to [be **good** ]{.mark}**international
[citizens]{.mark}**]{.underline}.' It should be acknowledged, they
admit, that [faithful [norms observation is]{.mark} also
[common]{.mark}]{.underline} behaviour [[among]{.underline}
**[autocracies]{.underline}**]{.mark}. '[Abiding by]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[law]{.underline}** [and its
established norms is, by and large, normal behaviour in the
international society of states]{.underline}. However, some
nondemocracies are more likely to end up in the minority that deviates
from this normalcy. Totalitarian states with a power-seeking or paranoid
leadership are more likely to breach their obligations openly or
clandestinely.'62

### 1AR\-\--Prolif\-\--Ext\-\--No Prolif

#### Prolif is slow -- weapons are complex and -time-consuming and states fear backlash

**Hymans 14** (Jacques, associate professor of international relations
at the University of Southern California, "No cause for panic: Key
lessons from the political science literature on nuclear proliferation,"
*International Journal*, Vol. 69(I), 85-93, DOI:
10.1177/0020702014521565)

[In 1963]{.underline}, President John F. [Kennedy declared himself
''haunted'' by the expectation that the club of nuclear weapon states
would grow to 15 or even 25 members by the
mid-]{.underline}19[70s]{.underline}, unless the world could come
together on a global nuclear test ban treaty.1 Despite Kennedy's
efforts, his hoped-for Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty finally
materialized only in 1996, and as of 2013 the treaty had still not yet
garnered enough state adherents to enter into force.2 Nevertheless,
[[there are fewer than 10 nuclear weapon states in the world]{.mark}
today, 50 years after Kennedy's dark prediction]{.underline}. Why are
nuclear weapons arsenals still so uncommon? Political scientists have
wrestled with this puzzle ever since the proliferation issue surged to
prominence after the end of the Cold War. Despite its diversity of
theoretical and empirical approaches, [[the political science literature
has come to a]{.mark} rough **[consensus on the slow pace of
proliferation.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Simplistic ''realist'' arguments
that ''nuclear weapons are a wonderful deterrent, that's why states love
them''3 have been falsified---as the realists themselves increasingly
acknowledge. Instead, [scholars of proliferation point out that most
[states are]{.mark} **naturally [reticent]{.mark}** [to take a step that
could unleash]{.mark} highly [uncertain]{.mark} and potentially
revolutionary [consequences.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is therefore
actually quite easy to understand why most states are not seeking to
obtain the bomb; what is harder to understand is why a handful of states
still do seem to want it. The political science literature also
emphasizes that, [despite global technical and economic progress since
1945, [building nuclear weapons]{.mark} systems [remains complex,
costly, dangerous, and]{.mark} potentially very
[time-consuming.]{.mark}]{.underline} Therefore, [even [among the small
number of]{.mark} genuine [nuclear]{.mark} weapons [aspirants, failure
to achieve their]{.mark} ultimate [goal is]{.mark} at least [as likely
as success.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, [[in recent decades the failure
rate has]{.mark} sharply [increased.]{.mark}]{.underline} The overall
political science finding of the great proliferation slowdown needs to
be recognized by policy analysts focusing on single countries of
concern, such as Iran or North Korea. [Proliferation is a]{.underline}
serious [problem, but **[there is no cause for
panic.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Slow proliferation doesn't open the floodgates 

**Waltz 3** (Kenneth, The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate Renewed,
2003, p. 42-43)

[Countries have to take care of their own security,]{.underline} if
countries feel insecure and believe that nuclear weapons would make them
more secure, [America's policy of opposing the spread of nuclear weapons
will not prevail.]{.underline} Any slight chance of bringing the spread
of nuclear weapons to a halt exists only if the United States
strenuously tries to achieve that end. To do so carries costs measured
in terms of other interests. The strongest way for the United States to
persuade other countries to forego nuclear weapons is to guarantee their
security. How many states' security do we want to guarantee? Wisely, we
are reluctant to make promises, but then we should not expect to decide
how other countries provide for their security. [[Some]{.mark} have
[fear]{.mark}ed that [weakening opposition to the spread of nuclear
weapons will lead numerous states to obtain them]{.mark} because it may
seem that "everyone is doing it." Why should we think that if we relax,
numerous states will begin to make nuclear weapons? [Both the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and the Soviet Union were
relaxed]{.mark} in the past, [and those effects did not
follow]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Soviet Union initially supported
China's nuclear program. The United States helped both Britain and
France to produce nuclear weapons. By 1968 the CIA had informed
President Johnson of the existence of Israeli nuclear weapons, and in
July of 1970, Richard Helms, director of the CIA, gave this information
to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. These and later disclosures
were not followed by censure of Israel or by reductions of economic
assistance. And in September of 1980, the executive branch, against the
will of the House of Representatives but with the approval of the
Senate, continued to do nuclear business with India despite its
explosion of a nuclear device and despite its unwillingness to sign the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty[. [Many more countries can make nuclear
weapons than do]{.mark}.]{.underline} One can believe that American
opposition to nuclear arming stays the deluge only by overlooking the
complications of international life. Any state has to examine many
conditions before deciding whether or not to develop nuclear weapons.
Our opposition is only one factor and is not likely to be the decisive
one. Many states feel fairly secure living with their neighbors. Why
should they want nuclear weapons? Some countries, feeling threatened,
have found security through their own strenuous efforts and through
arrangements made with others. South Korea is an outstanding example.
Many officials believe that South Korea would lose more in terms of
American support if it acquired nuclear weapons than it would gain by
having them. Further, on occasion we might slow the spread of nuclear
weapons by not opposing the nuclear weapons programs of some countries.
When we opposed Pakistan's nuclear program, we were saying that we
disapprove of countries developing nuclear weapons no matter what their
neighbors do. [[The gradual spread of nuclear weapons has not opened the
nuclear floodgates.]{.mark} Nations attend to their security in the ways
they think best.]{.underline} The fact that so many more countries can
make nuclear weapons than do says more about the hesi­tation of countries
to enter the nuclear military business than about the effectiveness of
American nonproliferation policy. [We should suit our policy to
individual cases,]{.underline} sometimes bringing pressure against a
country moving toward nuclear weapons capability and sometimes quietly
acquiescing: No one policy is right in all cases. We should ask what the
inter­ests of other countries require before putting pressure on them.
Some countries are likely to suffer more in cost and pain if they remain
conventional states than if they become nuclear ones. [The measured
spread of nuclear weapons does not run against our interests and can
increase the security of some states]{.underline} at a price they can
afford to pay.

#### Nuclear power is dead-- nothing the government can do will change the fundamental economics- low natural gas prices, low consumer demand, high construction costs -- deregulation and massive subsidies wouldn't be sufficient to solve

[the awarding of]{.underline} as many as two [more loan
guarantees]{.underline} for nuclear reactor projects, (2) possible
[additional nuclear loan guarantee authority]{.underline} in the House
FY2011 Continuing Resolution and (3) [a proposed increase of nuclear
loan guarantees]{.underline} in the White House FY 2012 budget.
[However]{.underline}, **[prevailing [market trends could not be
worse]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[for lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark} and
taxpayers who are [[concerned about the]{.mark} risk of
[defaults]{.mark}]{.underline} on any new loan guarantees.¶ [Contrary to
what is asserted by proponents]{.underline} of building more new nuclear
reactors in the United States, (1) there is no \"nuclear renaissance\"
underway in this country, (2) [the]{.underline} beleaguered nuclear
[industry\'s chief woes are not regulatory hurdles in]{.underline}
Washington, [D.C.,]{.underline} and (3) calling nuclear power \"clean\"
won\'t alter the fundamental reality that **[[nuclear power is]{.mark}
totally [uneconomic]{.mark}]{.underline}**.¶ **[[The nuclear power
industry is dead in the water]{.underline}]{.mark}** today in the U.S.
**[because [nuclear power is]{.mark} simply [too
expensive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Only a French-style socialist
arrangement under which the industry (by government fiat) has unlimited
access to taxpayer-backed loan guarantees and the pocketbooks of
ratepayers prior to and during the reactor construction process would
allow utilities to even contemplate building new nuclear reactors.
[[Even with]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[massive subsidies]{.mark} their
[prospects are murky]{.mark}]{.underline}, at best.¶ Four [marketplace
developments ended the nuclear renaissance before it began]{.underline}.
Those factors are:¶ â€¢ [[Skyrocketing cost of building new]{.mark}
nuclear [reactors]{.mark}]{.underline}, with no end in sight to the
upward spiral;¶ â€¢ [[Falling natural gas prices]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that could stay low for decades]{.underline}, as new technologies have
dramatically increased the amount of natural gas that is recoverable;¶
â€¢ [[Lower cost alternatives]{.mark} that [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[widely available]{.underline}]{.mark} and afford utilities much more
flexibility in meeting the need for electricity in an uncertain economic
and policy environment.¶ â€¢ [[Declining demand]{.mark} growth [for
electricity]{.mark}]{.underline}, with growing evidence that there has
been a permanent shift in the pattern of growth; [[and¶ Public policy
cannot repeal economic reality]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[Nuclear
economics are so bad that subsidies]{.underline}]{.mark}** (in the form
of federal loan guarantees or unfunded mandates like a federal \"Clean
Energy Standard\"), as well as the infusion of capital from foreign
equipment vendors and/or foreign governmnets, **[[are not enough to kick
start reactor construction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The nuclear industry
is demanding state ratepayers subsidize and guarantee to pay the
construction costs, even if the reactors are not built. [The nation does
not need]{.underline} \-- and the federal government should not force
taxpayer and ratepayers to fund \-- [another multi-billion-dollar
bailout of an industry that is totally uneconomic and has no chance of
standing on its own.¶]{.underline} The following charts vividly
illustrate the folly of the federal government taking further steps to
make nuclear even more of a \"ward of the state.\"¶ Factor 1: [Nuclear
reactors cost much more than the industry projected]{.underline} [when
it made the case for them]{.underline}. You never hear about a new coal
or natural gas-fired power plant costing 100 percent or 200 percent more
to build than was initially projected. But [low-balled front-end cost
projections and rising back-end construction costs are the
norm]{.underline} in the nuclear power industry. Not only does [the
sky-high projected cost]{.underline} of nuclear power [make them
impossible to finance on Wall]{.underline} Street â€" and unable to
produce price competitive power â€" but the ever-rising construction
costs make them even bigger white elephants. U.S. taxpayers and
ratepayers have much to fear if elected officials rush in with direct
and indirect subsidies where Wall Street fears to tread. The industry
understated its initial cost projections in order to get a seat at the
energy policy table, counting on being able to stick taxpayers and
ratepayers with the inevitably much higher price tag at a later date.¶
Factor 2: [[Nuclear power]{.mark} simply [cannot compete with low-cost
natural gas]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In a competitive marketplace,
natural gas beats nuclear hands down from a price standpoint. This was a
major factor in the collapse of the Calvert Cliffs-3 project in
Maryland. Studies have shown that if built the South Texas Project â€"
the next candidate in line for a federal loan guarantee â€" could not
deliver electricity cheaply enough to survive. **[[It is the key
factor]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[that]{.mark} has [led]{.mark} many of
the [leading nuclear utilities]{.mark} i]{.underline}n the U.S. [[to
abandon plans]{.mark} for construction]{.underline} of new reactors.¶
Factor 3: Natural gas is not the only alternative with which nuclear
cannot compete. [[There are numerous lower cost alternatives]{.mark}
available to meet the need for electricity]{.underline} whether or not
the U.S. adopts policies to reduce carbon emissions in the electricity
sector. If technologies are allowed to compete on a level playing field
to meet the need for electricity, nuclear reactors would be unable to
win in the marketplace for the foreseeable future. Policies that address
climate change help most of the alternatives as much as nuclear if not
more so. [[This is]{.mark} a key reason [why capital markets will not
fund these projects]{.mark}]{.underline} and the industry is so
desperate for subsidies.¶ Factor 4: [Rapidly falling consumer demand for
electricity has destroyed the case for]{.underline} many proposed
[nuclear reactors.]{.underline} While [the recession has depressed
demand]{.underline} for electricity in the near term, it is becoming
clear that [a major shift in consumption patterns is taking
place]{.underline}, [driven]{.underline} in part [by]{.underline} the
success story of [increased energy efficiency]{.underline}. Energy
efficiency is the cheapest, cleanest and fastest energy source available
today â€" it is significantly less expensive than nuclear and involves
no safety issues, waste disposal problems and lengthy construction
delays.

### 2AC\-\--Water

#### No water wars---empirics 

**Dinar 12** (Shlomi Dinar is an associate professor in the Department
of Politics and International Relations and associate director of the
School of International and Public Affairs at Florida International
University, 10/18, "IN THE NEWS: No Wars for Water: Why Climate Change
Has Not Led to Conflict", Foreign Affairs,
http://globalchange.mit.edu/news-events/news/news_id/210#.UXnGirWsiSo)

Of course, the [policy]{.underline} community has long [prophesied
impending \"water wars.\"]{.underline} In 2007, UN Secretary General Ban
Ki Moon warned that \"water scarcity \... is a potent fuel for wars and
conflict.\" Yet [history has not witnessed many]{.underline}. In fact,
[[the only]{.mark} official [war over water took
place]{.mark}]{.underline} about **[[4,500 years
ago]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It was a conflict
[[between]{.underline}]{.mark} the city-states [of [Lagash and
Umma]{.underline}]{.mark} in modern day Iraq over the Tigris river. More
recently, there have been some close calls, especially in the arid
Middle East. About two years before the 1967 War, Israel and Syria
exchanged fire over the Jordan River Basin, which both said the other
was overusing. The [[limited]{.mark} armed [clashes peter]{.mark}ed
[out]{.mark}]{.underline}, but the political dispute over the
countries\' shared water sources continues. In 2002,
[Lebanon]{.underline} constructed water pumps on one of the river\'s
tributaries, which caused concern for downstream
[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[project never
provoked]{.underline}]{.mark} any [[formal military
action]{.underline}]{.mark}, but with peace in the region already
precarious, verbal exchanges between the two countries prompted the
United States to step in. [Both [parties]{.mark}]{.underline} eventually
[[accept]{.mark}ed]{.underline} a [[compromise]{.underline}]{.mark} that
would allow Lebanon to withdraw a predetermined amount of water for its
domestic needs.

In short, [[predictions of a Water]{.mark} World [War are
**overwrought**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} However, tensions over water
usage can still exacerbate other existing regional conflicts. Climate
change is expected to intensify droughts, floods, and other extreme
weather conditions that jeopardize freshwater quantity and quality and
therefore act as a threat-multiplier, making shaky regions shakier.

#### No escalation even if they start \-- too many limiting factors

**Harpers 00** (July 1, lexis)

Yet such wars haven\'t quite happened. Aaron [Wolf, an Oregon State
University specialist in water conflicts, maintains that [the last war
over water was fought]{.mark} between the Mesopotamian city states of
Lagash and Umma [4,500 years ago]{.mark}.]{.underline} Wolf has found
that [[during the twentieth century only 7 minor skirmishes were
fought]{.mark} over water [while 145 water-related treaties were
signed.]{.mark} He argues that o[ne reason is strategic: in a conflict
involving river water, the aggressor would have to be both
downstream]{.mark}]{.underline} (since the upstream nation enjoys
unhampered access to the river[) [and militarily superior]{.mark}. As
Wolf puts it, \"An upstream riparian would have no cause to launch an
attack, and a weaker state would be foolhardy to do so.\" And if a
powerful downstream nation retaliates]{.underline} against a water
diversion by, say, destroying its weak upstream neighbor\'s dam,
[[it]{.mark} still [risks the consequences, in the form of flood or
pollution or poison from upstream.]{.mark}]{.underline} So, until now,
water conflicts have simmered but rarely boiled, perhaps because of the
universality of the need for water. Almost two fifths of the world\'s
people live in the 214 river basins shared by two or more countries;
[the Nile links ten countries, whose leaders are profoundly aware of one
another\'s hydrologic behavior. Countries usually manage to cooperate
about Water, even in unlikely circumstances.]{.underline} In 1957,
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and South Vietnam formed the Mekong Committee,
which exchanged information throughout the Vietnam War. Through the
1980s and into the 1990s, Israeli and Jordanian officials secretly met
once or twice a year at a picnic table on the banks of the Yarmuk River
to allocate the river\'s water supply; these so-called picnic-table
summits occurred while the two nations disavowed formal diplomatic
contact. Jerome Delli Priscoli, editor of a thoughtful trade journal
called Water Policy and a social scientist at the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, believes the whole notion of water conflict is
overemphasized: \"Water irrigation helped build early communities and
bring those communities together in larger functional arrangements. Such
community networking was a primary impetus to the growth of
civilization. Indeed[, water may actually be one of humanity\'s great
learning grounds for building community\.... The thirst for water may be
more persuasive than the impulse toward conflict.\"]{.underline}

### 1AR\-\--Water\-\--Ext\-\--No War

#### No water wars -- shared resource nature and conflict fails -- third variables outweigh water scarcity in explaining war

**Victor 07** (David G, Adjunct Senior Fellow for Science and
Technology, Council on Foreign Relations; Director, Program on Energy
and Sustainable Development @ Stanford "What Resource Wars?" 11/12
<http://www.nationalinterest.org/Article.aspx?id=16020>)

While there are many reasons to fear global warming, [[the
risk]{.underline}]{.mark} that such [[dangers]{.mark} [could cause
violent conflict ranks extremely low]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}on
the list [because [it is highly unlikely to
materialize]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite decades of warnings about
water wars, what is striking is that **[[water wars don\'t
happen]{.underline}]{.mark}**-usually [[because countries that share
water]{.underline}]{.mark} resources [[have a lot more at stake
and]{.underline}]{.mark} armed [[conflict rarely fixes the
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some analysts have pointed to conflicts
over resources, including water and valuable land, as a cause in the
Rwandan genocide, for example. Recently, the UN secretary-general
suggested that climate change was already exacerbating the conflicts in
Sudan. But none of these supposed causal chains stay linked under close
scrutiny-the conflicts over resources are usually symptomatic of deeper
failures in governance and other primal forces for conflicts, such as
ethnic tensions, income inequalities and other unsettled grievances.
Climate is just one of many factors that contribute to tension. The same
is true for scenarios of climate refugees, where the moniker \"climate\"
conveniently obscures the deeper causal forces.

#### Experts, empirics, huge cost, tech solves scarcity, and treaties effective

And [[water crises do not mean water wars]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
issue of access to water resources is undoubtedly a major dimension of
numerous regional crises, in particular in the Greater Middle East, as
testified by decades-old disputes between Turkey and Syria, or Egypt and
Sudan. The value of strategic locations such as the Golan Heights or
Kashmir is not a small part of tensions between Syria and Israel, or
India and Pakistan. And water sharing can be the cause of local disputes
sometimes degenerating into small-scale collective violence in Africa or
Asia. However, [[experts]{.mark} from the University of Oregon, who
maintain the most complete database on this topic, [state]{.mark} that
**[there has never been a ''war over water'']{.mark}**]{.underline}
(that is, large-scale collective violence for the sake of a water
resource) [[in]{.mark} the past [4,500 year]{.mark}s.35 The last war
over water opposed two Sumerian cities in the middle of the third
millennium B.C.E.,]{.underline} about sharing the waters of the Tigris
and Euphrates. There are good reasons for such a scant record. [Any
country seeking to control the upstream of a river would need to ensure
complete and permanent domination over it, which would be an ambitious
goal.]{.underline} In the modern era, [[resorting to arms over
water]{.underline}]{.mark} (like resorting to arms over oil) [[is just
not worth the cost]{.mark}. [Especially for those whose]{.mark}
geographical location and [budget can afford]{.mark} to build
[desalination]{.mark} plantswhich is [the case for]{.mark} some of the
[most water-stressed countries]{.mark},]{.underline} those located on
the Arabian Peninsula. One should therefore not be surprised that access
to water has always generated more cooperation than conflict. [Since
antiquity, [thousands of agreements and treaties have been signed for
water-sharing]{.mark}. And **[coop]{.mark}**eration between adversaries
**[has stood the test of wartime]{.mark}**,]{.underline} as was seen
during the 20th century in the Middle East, South Asia, or Southeast
Asia.

#### Strategic and economic motivations check

There is actually good reason why [[we should
expect]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[water war arguments to be]{.underline}
**[seriously overstated]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [First,
[waging]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}a [[war for
water]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[makes very little strategic
sense]{.underline}]{.mark}. What would be the goal? [Only
[downstream]{.mark}]{.underline} strong [[states]{.mark} have the
motivation]{.underline} and ability, [but they [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
forever [[vulnerable to retribution]{.underline}]{.mark} from upstream
states intentionally polluting the water source. So a war would require
not just a simple power demonstration but a permanent occupation and
possible depopulation of the entire watershed. [Second]{.underline},
such a [[war would be extremely costly]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially
compared to the price of desalination. As an Israeli Defense Forces
analyst pointed out: "Why go to war over water? [[For the price of one
week's fighting, you could build five desalination
plants]{.underline}]{.mark}. No loss of life, no international pressure,
and a reliable supply you don't have to defend in hostile territory."
[Third, [states]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[share interest in
water]{.underline}]{.mark}, with upstream states getting hydropower from
dams and downstream states getting better-managed water for agriculture.
[Finally, [water cooperation is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[highly
resilient]{.underline}]{.mark}- the Mekong Committee on water functioned
throughout the Vietnam war, Israel and Jordan held secret water talks
throughout 30 years of formal war, and the Indus River Commission
survived two wars between India and Pakistan.

### 2AC\-\--Turn\-\--US Cred Good

#### Nuclear leadership solves every major impact

"International Perceptions of U.S. Nuclear Policy"
<http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/2007/070903.pdf>)

Perceptual relationships, however, are another matter. The third
implication of this research is that [[nuclear policy matters immensely
for]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates' [[international reputation. Such]{.mark}
reputation [effects]{.mark} can [have significant impact
in]{.mark}]{.underline} terms of [gaining [international
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} in [[addressing]{.mark} global [issues
that require multilateral solutions]{.mark} -- and]{.underline} given
[the interdependent]{.underline} nature of the [world]{.underline}
today, [most issues fall into this category]{.underline}. As the
remaining global superpower, the United States is often held to a higher
standard in most issue areas, including its responsibilities under
Article VI and commitments made at the 2000 Review Conference of the
NPT.4 Thus, given the remarkable agreement among the views of the four
countries examined here, it is likely that any small changes in US
nuclear policy that are perceived as moving away from disarmament will
be judged harshly in the international community as hypocritical and
increasing global nuclear danger. Sadly, even small US actions towards
disarmament may only earn international respect if they are matched by
cooperative policies in other issue areas. In sum, the United States is
unlikely to win the perceptual game as long as some of its policies
and/or actions are perceived as unilateral and aggressive.

Viewed another way, the "wicked problem" (a problem having complex,
adaptive, unpredictable components) that US nuclear policy and posture
is trying to address is global proliferation of WMD. 5 Yet, WMD
proliferation is not a problem that the United States can address
effectively alone. To address global proliferation concerns, the United
States needs the rest of the world to participate in the process. Given
how complex the WMD proliferation problem is, this requires not only
other international actors to commit to solving the "problem" with us
but that they have a similar understanding of what the "problem" is.
This common problem definition is not possible when the rest of the
world has negative perceptions of the United States, when US policies
and actions (in the nuclear and non-nuclear arenas) are perceived as
unilateral and hypocritical. Indeed, this paper suggests that many
international actors appear to view US policy and actions as one of the
contributors to the WMD proliferation problem. In other words, US
actions actually affect how other states define the problem, and how
they define the problem affects what they believe the "right" solution
is. Given their different understanding, it is not surprising that the
"wicked" problem becomes even thornier to address. How the United States
and other actors define the problem affects which solution strategies
will be considered. Thus, perceptions can have important strategic
consequences.

In short, how other international actors perceive US policies and
actions matters a great deal in their decisions about how much they will
cooperate on the US policy goal of nonproliferation. This finding also
accords with the SAIC study, which reported that US allies argue that "a
greater US readiness to engage on nuclear disarmament issues would pay
off in increased support from other third parties in pursing US
non-proliferation objectives."6 The tragic irony is this: US nuclear
policy and actions, which have the objective of trying to "solve" the
global proliferation problem, may actually be making other international
actors feel less secure. Their increased sense of insecurity lessens
international security overall and reverberates back to the US as a
heightened insecurity as well. Thus, if the US is trying to reduce
proliferation in the world, it will not succeed by using its nuclear
policies as its only lever. Cooperative nuclear policies will have to be
matched by cooperative policies in other areas, if the US wants "credit"
for leading the world towards a reduced nuclear danger.

Finally, the implications of this analysis could be good or bad news for
the US nuclear complex. The bottom line is that US nuclear policy by
itself is relatively unimportant, when viewed through the perspective of
other international actors. Thus, small changes in the US nuclear
posture, such as transforming the complex or improving US weapon surety,
are unlikely to create a huge international outcry, especially if they
are counter-balanced by cooperative US policies in other issue areas.
The good news is that the US nuclear complex could "fly under the radar
screen" with new nuclear initiatives, as long as the United States were
acting cooperatively in other issue areas. Alternatively, because US
nuclear policy by itself (short of unilateral disarmament or escalated
deployments) is relatively unimportant in US relations with other
states, US policymakers may decide that spending political capital in
this area is not worth the price. In this case, the bad news is that US
policymakers may view changes in nuclear policy as having steep domestic
political costs (judging by Congressional resistance to existing
initiatives) and providing very little benefit in relations with other
states, and thus decide to leave the Complex to languish.

This paper consists of six sections and a conclusion. The first section
grounds the analysis about international responses to US nuclear policy
within a wider theoretical discussion about international cooperation
and "wicked" problems. The second section provides an overview of the
methodology of analysis. The next four sections examine responses to US
nuclear policy in the four countries of interest -- China, Iran,
Pakistan and Germany. The conclusion suggests some common themes from
the four countries and offers implications for the US nuclear complex.

CONSIDERATIONS

There has been much debate in policy circles about the effect of US
nuclear policy on global nuclear proliferation. Some observers, such as
Ashton Carter and Keith Payne, argue that US nuclear policy has no
effect on other states' decisions to acquire nuclear weapons. Rather,
they argue, states decide to proliferate for domestic political or
regional security reasons. The problem with this argument is that US
actions could have prompted or exacerbated the "regional security
reason," which suggests that there are very few "pure" regional reasons.
For example, the United States' decision to include Taiwan under its
extended deterrence nuclear umbrella affects China's nuclear and
conventional security posture in the Taiwan Straits. Similarly, as will
be discussed in the section on Pakistan below, the United States'
civilian nuclear deal with India significantly changes Pakistan's
calculus in the South Asia.

Others argue that US decisions lead other states to be more inclined to
acquire their own nuclear weapons. These observers argue that US nuclear
policy creates the perception of hypocrisy in light of the United
States' responsibilities towards eventual disarmament under Article VI
of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This view has most
recently been espoused by the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission,
chaired by Hans Blix, the former chief United Nations weapons inspector.
In his introduction to the June 2006 commission report, Weapons of
Terror: Freeing the World of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Arms, Blix
argued that American unwillingness to cooperate in international arms
agreements, its failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and
its missile defense program are undermining efforts to curb nuclear
weapons. Treaty-based disarmament is being set back by "an increased US
skepticism regarding the effectiveness of international institutions and
instruments, coupled with a drive for freedom of action to maintain an
absolute global superiority in weaponry and means of their delivery."
The report drew a direct link between the rise of individual action and
the decline of cooperation, and thus "nuclear weapons states no longer
seem to take their commitment to nuclear disarmament seriously." Blix
clearly placed the blame at the feet of the United States: "If it takes
the lead, the world is likely to follow. If it does not take the lead,
there could be more nuclear tests and new nuclear arms races."7

This debate about the effects of US nuclear policy on other nations'
willingness to cooperate with international non-proliferation regimes is
a subset of a wider debate about cooperation in international relations.
On the one hand, realists argue that cooperation between states is
always ephemeral, because the international system lacks an overarching
world government to enforce agreements and states have to take care of
themselves, by accumulating economic and military power. In this
zero-sum world, any attempts at international cooperation will always
fail, because states can never trust other states to uphold their end of
the bargain. Thus, even though all states would be better off if they
could cooperate with each other, each individual state has an incentive
to defect from the agreement first to gain a relative advantage over its
competitors. 8 Thus, realists would advise carrying a big stick and
going it alone, since any attempts at multilateral cooperative policies
are doomed to fail over the long run.

In contrast, liberal institutionalists argue that cooperation among
states is possible, despite the lack of a world government to enforce
agreements. These scholars argue that states are less concerned with
relative power gains over potential adversaries and more concerned with
absolute gains in power. To capture the potential gains from
cooperation, states have created a number of institutions and regimes
that increase transparency in the international system, lower
transaction costs, make defection less likely through increased
"audience costs"9, make reciprocity easier, and allow states to share
the burden of providing security for themselves, thus freeing resources
to be used in other ways.10 This cooperation is possible, theses
scholars argue, because states take a longer view of the future than
realists acknowledge. States realize that with repeated interactions,
cooperation is possible, because over time, states are most likely to
respond with a "tit for tat" strategy -- to treat other states as they
are themselves are treated.11 Therefore, if one side cooperates, the
most rational and most likely response by the other side is to cooperate
back.

Liberal institutionalists also differ from realists in their
understanding of power. While realists view power more narrowly in terms
of "hard power" (military and economic might), liberal institutionalists
also look at a state's "soft power" (a state's culture, values and
institutions). Hard power can be used to incite others to change their
positions through inducements or threats; in other words, hard power is
coercive. Soft power provides a more indirect way for a state to achieve
the outcomes it desires by attracting other states to it and getting
those states to want what it wants. With soft power, others want to
follow it, because they admire its values, emulate its example and
aspire to its level of prosperity and openness. In other words, soft
power is co-optive.12

The foundation of US soft power is the values that the United States
expresses in its culture and projects at home and abroad. US soft power
flows from the classical liberal values and institutional structures
expressed in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution --
freedom, tolerance, a respect for an open society, and individual rights
and equality before the law. US soft power is embodied in the checks and
balances and participatory nature of its democratic government and the
openness of its market economy. US soft power is embodied in its history
as the only nation to win a world war and use its wealth and
predominance to rebuild the defeated powers as open societies and to
create and nurture a network of inclusive international institutions,
including the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund and the Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the precursor to the
World Trade Organization. Most of all, it is embodied in the mythic
sense of the United States as "The City on the Hill," a moral beacon and
refuge that has drawn people for centuries in search of The American
Dream. It is US soft power that is captured in Emma Lazarus' poem
mounted on the Statue of Liberty:

Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore,

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!

Seen in light of this wider debate about cooperation and power in
international relations, US nuclear policy can be framed in terms of its
effects on US soft power rather than just traditional hard power
framing. Obviously, US nuclear policy aims to strengthen US hard power,
but it also has effects on soft power. This analysis suggests that US
nuclear policy undermines US soft power abroad. Given its status as a
nuclear weapons state in the NPT, and its commitment in that treaty to
eventual disarmament, the United States is faulted by other countries
when its nuclear policies are perceived to be at odds with this
disarmament goal. For example, many states view the United States'
decisions not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and to
withdraw from the 1972 ABM Treaty to develop a national missile defense
program -- while simultaneously trying to block other states from
developing nuclear programs -- as very hypocritical. The US hypocrisy is
perceived to extend to other policy areas as well, including (for
example): agriculture, pharmaceuticals, relations with authoritarian
leaders, and treatment of detainees.

Perceptions about all of these US actions have corroded US soft power.
These perceptions have made other states -- including allies -- less
inclined to cooperate with the United States. These actions also appear
to provide a basis for adversaries and others to call the American
commitment to freedom and peace into doubt. In other words, these
actions as they are perceived abroad appear to demonstrate that the
United States believes it is powerful enough -- and thus exceptional
enough -- to behave independently of international norms. As a Pakistani
security scholar, Ghazala Yasmin, argued in an article about the US NPR,
"The US seems to be sending a message across the world -- do as we say,
not as we do."13

How important is soft power, anyway? [Given]{.underline} its vast
[conventional military power, does the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [even need soft power? Some]{.underline} analysts
[argue that US military predominance is]{.underline} both
[possible]{.underline} and desirable [over the long term,
and]{.underline} thus [soft power is not important. But a growing
consensus disagrees]{.underline}. These analysts argue that [soft power
is critical for four reasons]{.underline}. First, [[soft power is
invaluable for keeping]{.mark} potential [adversaries from
gaining]{.mark} international [support]{.mark}, for ["winning]{.mark}
the peace" in [Afghanistan and Iraq, and]{.mark} for [convincing
moderates to refrain from supporting extremist]{.mark} terrorist
[groups]{.mark}. Second, [soft power helps influence]{.mark} neutral and
developing [states to support US global leadership]{.mark}. Third, [soft
power is]{.mark} [also important for convincing allies]{.mark} and
partners [to share the]{.mark} international [security
burden]{.mark}]{.underline}.14 [Finally,]{.underline} and perhaps most
importantly, [given the increasing interdependence and globalization of
the world system, [soft power is critical for addressing]{.mark} most
[security threats]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[faces today. [Most]{.mark} global security threats [are]{.mark}
[impossible to be countered by a single state]{.mark} alone.
[Terrorism]{.mark},]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction [([WMD)
prolif]{.mark}eration, [failed]{.mark} and failing [states, conflicts
over]{.mark} access to [resources]{.mark}, are not confined to any one
state. In addition, [disease, demographic shifts, environmental
degradation and]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark} will have negative
security implications as well]{.underline}.15 [All]{.underline} of these
potential threats share four traits: (1) they [are best addressed
proactively]{.underline}, rather than after they develop into full-blown
crises; (2) they [[require multi-lateral
approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}, often under the umbrella of an
international institution; (3) they are not candidates for a quick fix,
but rather [require multi-year]{.underline}, or multi-decade
[solutions]{.underline}; and, (4) they are "wicked" problems. Given
these four traits, [[soft power is critical]{.mark} for helping [to
secure the international]{.mark}, multi-lateral [cooperation]{.mark}
that will be [necessary to address]{.mark} such [threats
effectively]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If soft power is important in today's security landscape, how important
for regaining the "moral high ground" and repairing its soft power is a
perceived US commitment to the nonproliferation regime? How do
international actors perceive US nuclear policy and changes to that
policy?

Because of the nature of the weapons themselves, United States' nuclear
policy cannot be directed at just one actor or group of actors. Any
[[changes in US nuclear policy]{.mark} will [send signals to]{.mark}
multiple [actors in the international system]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
actors most often considered are potential adversaries, including
emerging peers, rogue states and non-state violent extremists. However,
the US posture also sends strong signals to allies, neutrals and other
states in the system that may be considering acquiring nuclear weapons.
Depending upon its congruence with the NPT (especially Article VI), US
nuclear policy also sends signals about US credibility in upholding
other international agreements and acting as a global leader in
international institutions. Each of these reactions occurs
simultaneously and interacts with each other, in turn affecting how the
US responds to those reactions. The strategic interaction is complex and
incredibly difficult to model.
