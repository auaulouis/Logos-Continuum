June 19 (UPI) \-- **[Ukraine will receive an additional \$250 million in
military aid, some of it for lethal weapons, from the United States, the
Defense Department announced. Sniper rifles, grenade launchers,
counter-artillery radar, electronic warfare detection equipment and
other material were on the list of items revealed on
Tuesday.]{.underline}** The support also includes considerable training
and advisory efforts by U.S. forces, notably for the Ukrainian navy,
which has been unable to counter Russian naval forces in the Black Sea.
\"The United States remains committed to helping Ukraine implement
provisions of Ukraine\'s 2018 Law on National Security to strengthen
democratic civilian control of the military, promote command and control
reforms, enhance transparency and accountability in acquisition and
budgeting, and advance defense industry reforms,\" the Pentagon said
Tuesday in a statement. \"These reforms will bolster Ukraine\'s ability
to defend its territorial integrity in support of a secure, prosperous,
democratic, and free Ukraine.\" **[Russia seized the Crimean peninsula
from Ukraine in 2014, and has supported separatist militants in the
eastern Ukrainian region known as the Donbas. In a 2018 naval incident
in the Kerch Strait, 24 Ukrainian seamen were captured by the Russian
navy as three Ukrainian ships were fired upon and seized. Those captured
remain in detention pending criminal proceedings.]{.underline}** Since
the Kerch Strait incident, NATO countries\' navies have expanded their
activities in the Black Sea. **[The additional U.S. aid will bring total
U.S. support of the Ukrainian military to \$1.5 billion since
2014.]{.underline}**

### 2.7% calculations -- notifications

#### topical affirmatives must defend a \$9,882,000,000 reduction in FMS and/or DCS -- that's 2.7% of notifications

**insert this chart created from [Security Assistance
Monitor]{.underline} data**

to create this chart, Sara Ann Brackett followed these steps: 1. view
the SAM data for FY14-18 at
<http://securityassistance.org/data/country/arms/country/2014/2018//Global//all>
2. export the data into an excel sheet by clicking the three dots to the
top right of the pivot table, selecting file format:excel, results:with
visualization options applied, values:unformatted, limit:results in
table, and whatever file name you would like. (sara ann's version
available here:
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pFIw6j47KIzp6F9qrh5WjiI0MWGzuCTq/view?usp=sharing>)
3. import your data into google sheets by copying and pasting it from
the excel sheet. then, you can create a chart by clicking insert\>chart,
selecting pie chart, then inputting the data range you'd like to
consider (notifications, authorizations, and deliveries can be easily
separated as they are different columns) sara ann's data, which is
sorted for easy viewing, can be viewed here:

### 2.7% calculations -- deliveries

#### topical affirmatives must defend a \$2,835,000,000 in FMS and/or DCS -- that's 2.7% of deliveries

**insert this chart created from [Security Assistance
Monitor]{.underline} data**

to create this chart, Sara Ann Brackett followed these steps: 1. view
the SAM data for FY14-18 at
<http://securityassistance.org/data/country/arms/country/2014/2018//Global//all>
2. export the data into an excel sheet by clicking the three dots to the
top right of the pivot table, selecting file format:excel, results:with
visualization options applied, values:unformatted, limit:results in
table, and whatever file name you would like. (sara ann's version
available here:
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pFIw6j47KIzp6F9qrh5WjiI0MWGzuCTq/view?usp=sharing>)
3. import your data into google sheets by copying and pasting it from
the excel sheet. then, you can create a chart by clicking insert\>chart,
selecting pie chart, then inputting the data range you'd like to
consider (notifications, authorizations, and deliveries can be easily
separated as they are different columns) sara ann's data, which is
sorted for easy viewing, can be viewed here:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ri7tZ9-BffB63klLEo02-9jKwfGN2gBAwi70QrzG22k/edit#gid=1085897148>

### 2.7% calculations -- authorizations

#### topical affirmatives must defend a \$9,342,000,000 reduction in FMS and/or DCS -- that's 2.7% of authorizations

**insert this chart created from Security Assistance Monitor data**

to create this chart, Sara Ann Brackett followed these steps: 1. view
the SAM data for FY14-18 at
<http://securityassistance.org/data/country/arms/country/2014/2018//Global//all>
2. export the data into an excel sheet by clicking the three dots to the
top right of the pivot table, selecting file format:excel, results:with
visualization options applied, values:unformatted, limit:results in
table, and whatever file name you would like. (sara ann's version
available here:
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pFIw6j47KIzp6F9qrh5WjiI0MWGzuCTq/view?usp=sharing>)
3. import your data into google sheets by copying and pasting it from
the excel sheet. then, you can create a chart by clicking insert\>chart,
selecting pie chart, then inputting the data range you'd like to
consider (notifications, authorizations, and deliveries can be easily
separated as they are different columns) sara ann's data, which is
sorted into separate sheets for easy viewing, can be viewed here:
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ri7tZ9-BffB63klLEo02-9jKwfGN2gBAwi70QrzG22k/edit#gid=1085897148>

#### fyi on sipri & other measurements methods

Paul **Holtom et al 12**, was the Director of the SIPRI Arms Transfers
Programme, Mark Bromley is the Director of the SIPRI Dual-Use and Arms
Trade Control Programme and a Senior Researcher with the SIPRI Arms
Transfers Programme, and Verena Simmel, who was an research intern with
the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme in 2011, "MEASURING INTERNATIONAL
ARMS TRANSFERS: SIPRI Fact Sheet", Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute, December 2012,

//](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/files/FS/SIPRIFS1212.pdf%20//)sab

The differences between the various methods for measuring international
arms transfers reflect both the purpose of the measurement and the
availability of data. For example, one method might be most useful for
attempting to assess the importance of arms exports for a national
economy, while another seeks to measure the transfer of military
capability. Two factors related to the availability of data that affect
overall measurements are the definition of the arms to be measured and
the units of measurement--- whether the estimate is based on the number
of weapons, the financial value of sales, the unit production costs, or
some other unit. This section briefly describes the methods used by
SIPRI, the CRS and national governments when measuring the volume or
financial value of arms exports.

SIPRI's method

SIPRI has developed a unique pricing system to measure the volume of
deliveries of major conventional weapons and components using a common
unit--- the SIPRI trend-indicator value (TIV). **[The TIV of an item
being delivered is intended to reflect its military capability rather
than its financial value.]{.underline}** This common unit can be used to
measure trends in the flow of arms between particular countries and
regions over time---in effect, a military capability price index.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the pricing system remains
consistent across both the weapon systems covered and over time, and
that any changes introduced are backdated.1

Each weapon that falls within the SIPRI definition of major conventional
arms (see box 1) is given a TIV. The TIV is derived from the known unit
production costs of a core set of weapons. The TIV for a weapon whose
unit production cost is unknown is calculated by making a comparison
with core weapons based on the following elements: size and performance
characteristics (i.e. weight, speed, range and payload); types of
electronics, loading or unloading arrangements, engine, tracks or
wheels, armament, and materials; and finally the era in which the weapon
was produced. Weapons that have previously been used by another armed
force (i.e. surplus weapons) are given a value equal to 40 per cent of
that of a new weapon. Used weapons that have been significantly
refurbished or modified by the supplier before delivery are given a
value of 66 per cent of the value when new. (See box 2 for examples
illustrating how the TIV of a transfer of arms is calculated). The
overall volume of arms exports from a particular state in any given year
is then calculated by adding together the TIVs for the weapons and
components delivered. Since year-on-year deliveries can fluctuate, SIPRI
uses 5-year moving averages to provide a more stable measure for trends
in international arms transfers.

**[The SIPRI TIV is often misinterpreted as a financial value. However,
it neither reflects the actual price paid for weapons nor represents
current dollar values for arms transfers.]{.underline}** The TIV should
therefore not be compared directly with gross national product (GNP),
gross domestic product (GDP), military expenditure, sales values or the
financial value of arms export licences. **[However, TIVs can be used as
the raw data for calculating trends in international arms transfers over
periods of time; indicative global percentages for suppliers and
recipients; and percentages for the volume of transfers to or from
particular states.]{.underline}**

The US Congressional Research Service's method

The CRS annual report Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations
aims to assist the US Congress 'in its oversight role of assessing how
the current nature of the international weapons trade might affect U.S.
national interests'.2 **[Despite its title, the report provides the
estimated financial value of arms export agreements and deliveries from
the largest arms exporters to all regions of the world in constant and
current US dollars for the previous eight calendar years. The CRS report
covers transfers to governments of 'all categories of weapons and
ammunition, military spare parts, military construction, military
assistance and training programs, and all associated
services'.]{.underline}**3 This definition is much broader than
SIPRI's**[. For data on US arms export agreements and deliveries, the
CRS report relies on information on government-to-government Foreign
Military Sales (FMS)]{.underline}**.4 On the sources of data for non-US
countries, the CRS simply states that 'Statistics for foreign countries
are based upon estimated selling prices', although it is believed that
the CRS draws on classified US Government sources.5 CRS figures for
non-US arms exporters are often lower than official government financial
values for export licences granted and arms exports.

### SIPRI bad

#### SIPRI doesn't cover the full definition of arms that most experts use -- excludes SALW

- also says that it's difficult to measure financial value of
  international arms trade = better on the aff

Paul **Holtom and** Mark **Bromley 10**, Holtom is director of the arms
transfers program at the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute. Bromley is a researcher in the same program, \"The
International Arms Trade: Difficult to Define, Measure, and Control\",
Arms Control Today, July/August 2010 issue,
https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2010_07-08/holtom-bromley, //sab

The now-defunct U**[.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA)
created the following comprehensive definition of the arms trade, which
has been widely used by researchers]{.underline}**:

> **[weapons of war, parts thereof, ammunition, support equipment, and
> other commodities designed for military use.... Dual-use
> equipment...when its primary mission is identified as
> military]{.underline}**. The **[building of defense production
> facilities and licensing fees paid as royalties]{.underline}** for the
> production of military equipment.... **[Military services such as
> training, supply operations, equipment repair, technical assistance
> and construction are included]{.underline}** where data are
> available.\[3\]

**[A similar definition of the arms trade is used to compile the U.S.
Congressional Research Service's (CRS) annual report]{.underline}**,
"Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations." In spite of the
name, the report contains estimates for the value of the global arms
trade, not just trade with developing countries. **[The CRS estimated
the financial value of deliveries of arms to be \$34.5 billion for
2007.]{.underline}**\[4\] Despite using a narrower definition of arms
transfers than the CRS, **[SIPRI's accounting]{.underline}** of official
financial data contained in national reports and official statements for
2007 **[generated a figure of \$51.1 billion for arms
exports]{.underline}**, representing 0.3 percent of world trade.\[5\]
This ﬁgure is likely to be lower than the true ﬁgure because a number of
signiﬁcant exporters, including China, do not release data on the
ﬁnancial value of their arms exports. **[The difference between the
SIPRI and CRS estimates is a further demonstration of the difficulty of
estimating the financial value of the international arms
trade.]{.underline}**

**[The SIPRI arms transfers database provides information on
international arms transfers from 1950 to the most recent calendar
year.\[6\] Its coverage is narrower than that of the ACDA, CRS, and
national control lists; for example, it does not include transfers of
most small arms and light weapons (SALW).]{.underline}** However, it
provides information on the number of units transferred and employs a
unique pricing system to measure the volume of arms transfers. The SIPRI
trend indicator value allows researchers to track developments in
transfers to and from different suppliers, recipients, and regions.
SIPRI data form the basis for the discussion below.

### SIPRI good

#### SIPRI is good -- TIV is the best measure of trends over time

The basic objective of this paper is to study some important aspects of
international arms trade in contemporary world. **[Two main sources have
traditionally been used to study the arms trade, namely, SIPRI and World
Military Expenditure and the Arms Trade (WMEAT)]{.underline}**,
previously provided by the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, now
by the Bureau of Verification and Compliance of the State Department.
**[In order to achieve the objective of the study, we have used the data
on arms transfer from the various issues of Year book of Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).]{.underline}** SIPRI
provides yearly data only on the volume of transfers of major
conventional weapons systems, not including transfers of small arms.
SIPRI uses the term "arms transfer" rather than "arms trade" or "arms
sale". Thus, SIPRI's definition of "arms transfer" includes sales,
manufacturing licences, aid, gifts and most loans or leases (Table 1).
The transfer's weapons must have a military purpose; the recipient must
be the armed forces or paramilitary forces or intelligence agency or
another country, a non-state armed group, or an international
organisation. **[SIPRI statistical data on arms transfers relates to
actual deliveries of major conventional weapons. It has developed a
unique system to measure the volume of international transfers of major
conventional weapons using a common unit, the Trend Indicator Value
(TIV).]{.underline}** **[The TIV is intended to represent the transfer
of military resources. Each weapon has its own specific TIV. It
calculates the volume of transfers by multiplying the weapons-specific
TIV with the number of weapons delivered in a given year. TIV figures do
not represent financial values for weapon transfers or sales prices of
arms transfers; they are an indicator of the volume of
transfers.]{.underline}** **[Therefore, TIV figures should not be cited
directly, compared with economic statistics such as GDP, military
expenditure, export and import. They are best used as the raw data for
calculating trends in international arms transfers over period of time,
global percentage for suppliers and recipients, and percentage for the
volume for transfers to or from particular state.]{.underline}**

**[The Security Assistance Monitor (SAM) program]{.underline}** at the
Center for International Policy, which I direct, **[was created
precisely to address the lack of robust analysis and reporting on these
issues. SAM houses the most comprehensive and accurate database publicly
available, holding official information on U.S. military assistance and
U.S. arms sales worldwide. SAM staff has reviewed U.S. government
documents, reports, budget justifications and congressional testimony to
develop a regularly updated methodology for U.S. security assistance.
Over the years, SAM staff has retrieved several hundred government
reports, combed through them and digitized all of the relevant
information. These databases help think tanks, journalists, academics,
government officials and congressional staff to conduct assessments and
analyze U.S. security assistance risks and effectiveness.]{.underline}**

### Notifications good

#### notifications & offers often fall through

Even in cases like U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, where the customer
pays the full cost of the weapons purchase, the economic benefits are
often less than meets the eye. First of all, **[large deals take time
and many are sidelined somewhere along the line due to changes of heart
or lack of funds on the part of the purchasing nation]{.underline}**.
**[As noted above, the Trump administration's \$5.2 billion offer of
F-18 combat aircraft to Canada is likely to be cancelled as a result of
a trade dispute with the United States. And of the \$110 billion in arms
offers made to Saudi Arabia during the Obama Administration years, only
half of them have resulted in formal agreements, and only about one
quarter of them have resulted in weapons actually being
delivered.]{.underline}**18 **[So, when an announcement of a major,
multi-billion-dollar arms deal is made, it cannot be taken for granted
that all of those dollars will ultimately be spent, and if they are, the
expenditures may be spread over many years.]{.underline}** In most cases
fewer jobs will be created over the life of a deal than anticipated in
the initial fanfare of a major sales announcement.

**Forum on the Arms Trade 7/12,** a network of civil society experts and
a point of contact for strengthening public efforts to address the
humanitarian, economic and other implications of arms transfers,
security assistance, and weapons use. Managed from Washington DC, the
Forum provides a venue for bringing its community\'s wide-ranging
expertise together to amplify and strengthen its work, while also
offering government and media members a one-stop resource for the latest
information, analysis, and best contacts. Forum-listed experts are
located around the world and work on diverse topics including human
rights, development, arms control, humanitarian disarmament,
cybersecurity, arms and the environment, anti-corruption, and related
fields. The Forum on the Arms Trade is currently directed by Jeff
Abramson, with the assistance of Ethan Kessler. "Major Arms Sales (via

**[With State Department blessing, the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency notifies Congress of major arms sales under the Foreign Military
Sales (FMS) program,]{.underline}** starting a clock (typically 30 days)
during which Congress can block a sale by passing a resolution to do so
in both the House and Senate. **[While certain terms of agreements may
change and deliveries (if any) take years to complete, these
notifications serve as important public moments to understand and
debate, where appropriate, future U.S. arms transfers (equipment and
services).]{.underline}**

\[footnote begins\] Because Congressional leaders are informally
consulted before public notification occurs, significant Congressional
opposition to notified sales is very rare, although importantly did
occur in 2016 regarding tanks to Saudi Arabia, and again in 2017
regarding PGMs to Saudi Arabia. **[Up until time of delivery, Congress
or the President can block or alter a sale.]{.underline}** (See CRS
report.) This page only looks at major arms sales notified here because
these tend to be the largest and most visible of eventual U.S. arms
transfers. However, U.S. arms sales and other transfers occur through a
variety of programs, including some led through the Commerce
Department**[. The Security Assistance Monitor is an excellent resource
for data and information on the broad range of U.S. arms and security
assistance.]{.underline}** \[footnote ends\]

### **[Notifications good]{.underline}**

#### notifications are a good way to measure fms -- indicate future interest -- AND that allows discussion of specific weapons systems

requests for FY18\", Defense News, 10-5-2018,

WASHINGTON --- **[The U.S. State Department approved just under \$70
billion in foreign weapon orders in fiscal year 2018, as the Trump
administration stepped up its focus on increasing defense sales abroad.
The \$69.7 billion in potential sales, spread over 70 individual
notifications,]{.underline}** fell short of last year's record figure,
during which the Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress
of \$75.9 billion. But domestic industry is unlikely to be bothered by
the slightly lower total, as the number shows America's dominance on the
defense export market remains solid. **[These numbers represent
potential arms sales that the State Department has cleared through its
processes; it does not represent actual sales. State ok's the sale, then
it is notified by the DSCA to Congress; if Congress does not reject the
potential sale, it then goes into negotiations, during which dollar
figures and quantities of equipment can change. However, while not solid
dollars, notifications are a notable way of tracking interest in
procuring American arms from foreign partners, and can be a leading
indicator of final sales to come.]{.underline}** Geographically, Europe
dominated, with 31 notifications for a potential \$37.34 billion. The
Gulf and Middle East region came in second with \$22.12 billion over 23
notifications, followed by the Asia-Pacific region with \$8.85 billion
on 12 notifications. Mexico (\$1.39 billion on three listings) and
Canada (one listing for \$140 million) round out the list. [**As always
with FMS notifications, a few specific projects drive the total way up.
A Saudi request for THAAD (\$15 billion) and a Polish request for
Patriot PAC-3 batteries (\$10.5 billion) accounted for over a third of
the total dollar value on their own. Belgium's request for F-35s (\$6.53
billion), Sweden's request for Patriot systems (\$3.2 billion) and
Japans' request for E-2D Hawkeyes (\$3.2 billion) round out the top five
largest requests.** **Overall, 15 notifications came with an estimated
price tag of over \$1 billion.**]{.underline}
