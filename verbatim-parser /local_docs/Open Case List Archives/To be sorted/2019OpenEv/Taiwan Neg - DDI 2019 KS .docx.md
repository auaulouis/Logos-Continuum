#### The United States federal government should ban space weapons.

#### CP solves case -- prevents war

in Space," Asian Perspective,

[First and foremost, [in designing an agreement is the need to ban
space-based weapons]{.mark} before any are deployed. [Both China and
Russia are adamantly opposed to these weapons, and]{.mark} Chinese
analysts [make a]{.mark} strong [case that a U.S. space-based,
boost-phase missile defense system would]{.mark} indeed [threaten the
PRC\'s basic nuclear deterrent.]{.mark}12 Space-based weapons, if they
are ever developed, would be hugely expensive, difficult to deploy, and
vulnerable to attack by China\'s and Russia\'s existing ASAT
capabilities.]{.underline}

[What [China]{.mark} seems to be [say]{.mark}ing to the United
State[s]{.mark}, by its actions more than its words, is: [If you]{.mark}
[go to the expense of developing and deploying space-based weapons, we
will be able to defend against them with our current ASAT, missile
defense, and cyber war capabilities.]{.mark} If it should come to a
military conflict between us, [we could destroy those weapons]{.mark} in
space or con- found their command and control by means of cyber-attacks.
As a result, the United States would be engaged in a one-sided arms race
in space, trying to gain dominance by means of space-based weapons,
while ignoring the fact that the weapons are vulnerable to asymmetrical
attack.]{.underline}

#### **[Other countries will follow -- US credibility high]{.underline}**

[Donald **CHRISTY** 3/15/**2006,** "United States Policy on Weapons in
Space," USAWC Strategy Research Project,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a449545.pdf>, CS]{.underline}

[[The first step is leadership in setting the intended standard. As the
world's only superpower, and the one nation in the best position to
weaponize space, by not doing so we may pave the way to ensure it never
happens.]{.mark}60 [Our]{.mark} current relative [dominance]{.mark} in
space [gives the United States unique credibility]{.mark} in leading an
international effort to limit space weapons, as the nation with
presumably the most to give up.]{.underline} It would be easy for Peru
to give up space weapons. Since they have no near-term prospects for a
space program, they really are not giving up anything tangible. By
renouncing space weapons, the United States is giving up something real
and tangible. This can have the effect of setting a very high
international value on preserving space as a weapons free sanctuary.
Initially, the United States should announce a policy of unilateral
constraint in the development and deployment of weapons in space.61 From
this position of strength, we should pursue and shape comprehensive and
verifiable international conventions that limit weapons in space. The
strength comes from a combination of our technological dominance in
space and our leadership position in the world. As discussed, space
weapons are a choice. [[If the United States, through international
leadership, places great value on a space sanctuary, it increases the
international pressure for others to follow suit.]{.mark} It also raises
the political ramifications of any nation's violation of the sanctuary
or unwillingness to participate in the conventions]{.underline}. If, on
the other hand, the United States acts as the pioneer for space weapons,
not only do we pay the political cost of breaking the sanctuary of
space, but we also reduce the cost (political and economic) of entry to
those who follow.62 [[Restraint increases the pressure for others to
restrain as well.]{.underline}]{.mark} Failing restraint, should another
space capable country be unwilling to sign and comply with the
conventions and later develop space weapons, it would greatly enhance
the political environment for the United States to counter any threat
including a greater likelihood of having partners, political and
otherwise, in the process.63

## Wolf Amendment CP

### 1NC

#### The USfg should overturn the Wolf Amendment

#### Solves US-Sino space relations

**[Foust 19]{.underline}** Jeff Foust, 4-8-2019, \"New opportunities
emerging for U.S.-China space cooperation,\" SpaceNews,
<https://spacenews.com/new-opportunities-emerging-for-u-s-china-space-cooperation/>
Lowell-SB

[Despite the rhetoric of a space race between the United States and
China, experts say there are opportunities for the countries to expand
cooperation in space that could have broader benefits.]{.underline}

**[Civil space cooperation between NASA and Chinese organizations is
sharply restricted by language commonly known as the Wolf Amendment,
first placed in an appropriations bill in 2011 by then-U.S. Rep. Frank
Wolf (R-Va.) Similar language has been included in subsequent
appropriations bills, including the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bill
enacted in February.]{.underline}**

The Wolf Amendment, though, doesn't bar cooperation between the two
countries in civil spaceflight. "A lot of people think that the Wolf
Amendment is a prohibition on working with the Chinese. It's not," said
Mike Gold, chairman of the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory
Committee, during a March 29 panel discussion on U.S.-China cooperation
by the Secure World Foundation.

[The provision, he noted, allows for cooperation if there is
certification from the FBI that such efforts don't pose a national
security risk and if Congress has been notified of the plan. "To me,
those are two commonsense steps," he said. That has allowed some limited
cooperation in areas like science and aeronautics.]{.underline}

However, many still see the amendment as a barrier to more significant
cooperation. "I absolutely agree that the Wolf Amendment does not
prohibit cooperation, but the effect of it has been to prohibit it,"
said Brian Weeden, director of program planning at the Secure World
Foundation. The restriction, coupled with political rhetoric critical of
working with China, has resulted in what he called a "stifling effect"
for any plans for enhanced partnerships between the two countries.

[Weeden said that restriction should be revisited. "While it's probably
a bridge too far to completely get rid of the Wolf Amendment," he said,
"it's probably time to think about how to relax it, or at least
prescribe areas where we might want to think about having cooperation
with China in space." Doing so, he added, "could lead to benefits for
this whole engagement process" between the two countries that go beyond
civil space.]{.underline}

This year could provide the best opportunity for modifying or
eliminating the amendment. Wolf retired from Congress after the 2014
elections and Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas), who succeeded Wolf as
chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA and who also
supported the amendment, lost re-election in 2018 as Democrats regained
the majority. House appropriators, though, have yet to bring up the Wolf
Amendment as they start planning for fiscal year 2020 spending bills.

[Speaking at the International Astronautical Congress in Bremen,
Germany, in October, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine showed interest
in enhanced cooperation with China, including a meeting with Zhang
Kejian, administrator of the China National Space Administration. "I
look forward to exploring more opportunities to do that," he said at the
event.]{.underline}

Bridenstine, though, was not nearly as eager when discussing the issue
in a media roundtable in February. "I'm not going to close that door,"
he said of potential bilateral or multilateral cooperation in space
exploration involving China, "but certainly it's not a door I'm opening
wide."

There has been recent, if limited, cooperation between NASA and China on
China's lunar exploration program. Patrick Besha, senior policy adviser
for strategic engagement and assessment at NASA, said at the Secure
World Foundation panel there was coordination with the Chinese
government regarding plans by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to
take high-resolution images of the landing site of the Chang'e-4
spacecraft on the far side of the moon earlier this year.

["It wasn't a formal agreement," he said, but that coordination was done
within the guidelines laid out by the Wolf Amendment. That cooperation
was "reasonably successful," he said, noting that it was limited to just
the Chang'e-4 mission.]{.underline}

"But it's a start," added Gold.

### Uniqueness

#### No Wolf amendment overturn now

**[Volodzko 15]{.underline}** David Volodzko is based in Chengdu, China,
where he writes for The Diplomat and is the author of the blog Rational
Consent, 11-13-2015, \"The US has a law to stop NASA from working with
China, and scientists hate it,\" Public Radio International,

Lowell-SB

Two of the biggest space movies of recent years, \"Gravity\" and \"The
Martian,\" imagine American astronauts turning to China for help. That
scenario, once far-fetched, is increasingly likely these days as China
rapidly becomes a leader in space exploration.

Most of the world welcomes it. The United States does not.

[Crossing frontiers isn't entirely new for China. What media popularly
call its "rise" is really a return --- for most of human history,
China's was the greatest civilization on Earth]{.underline}. China was
also the world's most intrepid explorer. Fixing his eyes on the stars
and braving the seas in the longest wooden ships ever built, the Chinese
admiral Zheng He may have beaten Columbus to North America, and
circumnavigated the globe before Magellan.

Then China went dark for almost 600 years. But today it's probing the
limits of the known world once more, fixed on the very same stars ---
now with the hopes of visiting them.

China is building the world\'s largest radio telescope, which will
outmeasure the American-run, 1,000-foot-wide Arecibo Observatory in
Puerto Rico by more than 600 feet. It also has plans for the world\'s
biggest solar telescope, nearly twice the size of the giant one that the
US is currently constructing in Hawaii. This month China unveiled its
Mars probe; its space lab will launch next year; and officials hope to
place their first manned space station in orbit around 2022.

The US, however, is torn on the issue. While September saw the inaugural
China-US Civil Space Dialogue between US State Department and China
National Space Administration officials in Beijing, NASA and the White
House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) are banned from
using federal funds to collaborate with the country or any Chinese
companies in any way. NASA cannot even allow Chinese officials to set
foot on agency property.

But the ban won't last, NASA chief Charles Bolden said last month,
"because everybody \... who has any hope of a human spaceflight program
\... will go to whoever will fly their people."

That could soon be China, which has already shown impressive progress by
launching its first satellite, carrying the first taikonaut (Chinese
astronaut) into space, orbiting the moon, managing its first space walk,
mastering orbital docking and landing its first lunar rover.

While a source of national pride, China's space program bears none of
the apocalyptic hostility that characterized the 20th-century Space
Race. In fact, when Yang Liwei became the first taikonaut to enter space
in October 2003, he celebrated with a show of international solidarity,
displaying the Chinese and UN flags side by side.

China has since collaborated with Brazil, Germany, France, Italy,
Russia, Sweden, the European Space Agency --- but, conspicuously, not
the US. What explains the United States' singular stance?

"It's really important that we keep the Red Chinese out of our space
program."

"The answer," writes Joan Johnson-Freese, professor of national security
affairs at the US Naval War College, "might well be realism versus
political theater."

Taking a stand against Chinese human rights abuses, it was former
Republican Representative Frank Wolf of Virginia --- who once compared
China to Nazi Germany --- who inserted the 2011 federal budget clause
banning NASA and the OSTP from bilateral cooperation with China.

As a result, Chinese scientists cannot board the International Space
Station (ISS), and in 2013 Chinese participants were banned from
attending a conference on NASA's space telescope program because it took
place at one of the agency's facilities (the ban was eventually reversed
after Wolf called it a misunderstanding of the law). Johnson-Freese
notes: "There was a joke that if a NASA employee was on a DC Metro car
with an Asian, he or she better switch cars."

And things may only get worse. Wolf retired as chair of the House
subcommittee that funds NASA this year but was replaced by Republican
Representative John Culbertson of Texas, who has said he will continue
to "keep the Red Chinese out of our space program."

One argument for doing so is to hold China accountable for its record on
human rights --- although defending the freedoms of Chinese artists and
journalists by throwing roadblocks in the way of Chinese scientists
hardly seems like progress. There's also nothing to suggest that
position will have any impact on Beijing's policies, especially when the
US is alone in shunning China's space program.

**[The other reason is that some US intelligence officials worry a
technological exchange with China could lead to
weaponization.]{.underline}**

[These fears were partly vindicated when, in January 2007, China used
one of its own weather satellites as target practice, obliterating it
with a ballistic missile and creating the largest cloud of space debris
in human history. The ISS crew subsequently had to take refuge in escape
capsules.]{.underline}

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Liu Jianchao dismissed concerns at
the time. "There's no need to feel threatened about this," he said. "We
are not going to get into any arms race in space."

Yet the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, in a report
due to be published this month, states that China is developing what it
calls "a broad and robust array" of space weapons, including missiles
that can take out satellites.

"The common enemy is complexity and cost."

[Whatever its purpose, the ambit of China's space program has already
eclipsed that of most other nations. Some observers speculate that NASA
"has flat-lined" while "China's space program could completely crush its
competition."]{.underline}

According to Baoying Heixi, professor of aerospace engineering at
Tsinghua University, these are exaggerations.

"China is a developing country," he told GlobalPost. "Its industry and
technology base is still very weak. Passing \[the\] US space program
needs many hundred years --- or never."

**[Still, China's progress --- without US help --- has been mighty.
There seems little reason to fear the Chinese stealing US technology
when they're getting by so well without it.]{.underline}**

The potential value of collaboration is in fact the same thing its
critics cite: the protection of resources.

["The long-term goals are the same from country to country," the former
commander of the ISS, Chris Hadfield, said during a trip to China last
year. "The combined objective is trying to understand the rest of the
universe. The common enemy is complexity and cost."]{.underline}

Simply put, collaboration saves time and money.

**["I hope personally NASA should open a door for Chinese citizens,"
says Baoyin. "I believe that many Chinese citizens can do something for
NASA."]{.underline}**

### Solvency

#### Overturn of wolf amendment is k2 US-Sino space collab

thawing of China-US space relations,\" Nature Index,

[By elite club standards, the International Space Station (ISS) is among
the most exclusive. Only 15 of the world's most powerful countries can
gain access to the remote location and the admission fee is
steep]{.underline}. The United States has barred China from joining the
club, but a recent delivery to the ISS could be its ticket --- though
space experts aren't holding their breath.

On 4 July, Dragon, a cargo spacecraft built by the US aerospace
manufacturer SpaceX, splashed down on Earth after a successful
month-long journey to the ISS. On board the craft were DNA samples from
the first-ever Chinese experiment to land on the space station. [The
experiment was developed by Deng Yulin, dean of the School of Life
Science and Technology at the Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT), to
investigate how the lack of gravity and presence of cosmic rays in space
affects DNA replication, potentially revealing new phenomena not
possible on Earth.]{.underline}

Deng has previously sent experiments to the Chinese spaceship
Shenzhou-8, carrier rocket Long March-7 and cargo spacecraft Tianzhou-1,
all of which were unmanned. The ISS offered the opportunity to conduct
more complex experiments managed by professional technicians.

To get on the ISS, the BIT partnered with Houston-based company
NanoRacks, which runs a commercial research facility on the space
station. The partnership has been widely recognized as an effort to
break the long-standing gridlock in China--US space relations.

In 2011, US Republican Congressman Frank Wolf introduced a two-sentence
clause into a funding appropriations bill prohibiting the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the White House Office
of Science and Technology Policy from cooperating in bilateral projects
with China.

[NASA funds the majority of space research in the US, and the
state-owned company China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation
holds a monopoly over space-related activities in China.]{.underline}

The two countries collaborated on many bilateral space projects in the
early 1990s, primarily using Chinese rockets to launch US satellites,
including the communications satellite AsiaSat 1, designed by Hughes
Aircraft Company, and many of the satellites in the Iridium
constellation, developed by Motorola. But their engagement since 2011
has been limited to individual researchers collaborating on
international projects involving at least one third-party intermediary.

In the Nature Index, the number of bilateral partnerships between
Chinese institutions and US companies have more than doubled since 2012.

To take their experiment to the ISS, BIT paid NanoRacks about
US\$200,000. According to Jeffrey Manber, chief executive of NanoRacks,
the company obtained permission from NASA, the US administration and
Congress, as well as the other ISS partners --- a process that took two
years. NanoRacks had to ensure that the blueprints for technologies on
the ISS would not be seen by the Chinese researchers and that NanoRacks
staff and ISS astronauts would not steal the intellectual property of
BIT.

Zheng Yongchun, a senior research fellow at the National Astronomical
Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, expects the historic ISS
landing to open the door for more collaborations between Chinese
institutions and US companies. But other factors are at play, says
Zheng. "The US's flexible attitude towards professor Deng's experiment
is due to China's rapid progress in developing its own space
technologies." In September 2016, China successfully launched the space
laboratory Tiangong-2.

Zheng's own work involves studying the surface characteristics of the
moon using data obtained from the Chang'e series of lunar exploration
missions, which many US scientists are keen to utilize, he says.

**[However, until the Wolf Amendment is repealed, US--China
space-science collaboration will remain limited, says Zheng. And with
China planning to build its own manned space station by 2022, Chinese
researchers might not be partnering with US companies for
long.]{.underline}**

A Chinese experiment heading for the International Space Station (ISS)
was launched on Saturday. Experts are considering the launch as
"historic," given the US government's restrictions on US-China space
cooperation.

SpaceX, a US space technology company, launched the Beijing Institute of
Technology (BIT) gene experiment towards the ISS on Saturday local time
from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

NanoRacks, a Houston-based company that facilitates commercial use of
the ISS, signed a cooperation agreement with BIT on DNA research in
2015.

Peter Bak, Head of the European Operation NanoRacks, called the project
a "stepping stone" for China-US space cooperation.

He added that it was, however, not easy for the project to go ahead,
because of US policy on cooperating with China in space.

"Every detail in this project has been looked through by NASA and
presented to Congress, explaining that NanoRacks is doing the service
without any violation of the Wolf amendment."

[The Wolf amendment, signed into NASA-funding appropriation bills by
then Republican Congressman Frank Wolf in 2011, prohibits NASA and the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from cooperating
with China on any space activities.]{.underline}

[Because of the Wolf amendment, Chinese and US scientists cannot "work
very closely" together, said Professor Yang Yuguang of the China
Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation.]{.underline}

He noted that Chinese scientific research, in fields such as life
sciences and material manufacturing, are in "great demand" for space
cooperation.

"Such demand is very common in China and in the US," Yang continued. "To
utilize these resources more efficiently in the future, it's reasonable
for each country to open its space lab."

[Professor John Horack of Ohio State University in Columbus dismissed
the Wolf amendment as "counterproductive", calling for governments to
build "trust, understanding" and to "communicate more clearly," **so
that they can follow where the private sectors, scientists and citizens
are leading the way**.]{.underline}

**["Space is a fundamental component of civilization," Horack added. "We
are all interested in preserving and promoting our civilization for all
people everywhere."]{.underline}**

#### US-China collaboration good -- leads to space exploration

Lowell-SB

NEW YORK - To claim we've already been to the moon is like spending a
day each in Iowa, Arizona, Rhode Island and maybe western Pennsylvania
and saying you've already been to Earth. There's a lot more to see on
the moon --- including the whole far side, the half that's perpetually
turned away from us. [That's one reason for the excitement behind the
Chinese-led mission Chang'e-4, which landed in this unexplored region
earlier this month.]{.underline}

Images from lunar orbit show the geology there is strikingly different
from the sites where Apollo astronauts explored. The craft landed in a
vast depression called the South Pole-Aitken basin, which takes up a
quarter of the lunar surface and appears to have formed early in the
history of our solar system, said planetary geologist Seth Jacobson of
Northwestern University. The rocks there could hold clues to how our own
planet formed.

The prevailing theory about the moon's origin is a dramatic one: Soon
after a proto-Earth came together, it collided with another planet the
size of Mars, coalescing into a bigger planet and the moon. Jacobson
said the lander is in an area where rocks from beneath the moon's crust
may have been brought to the surface by ancient impacts. Both NASA and
the China National Space Administration have proposed missions to go
back to this area and collect samples.

Though tantalizing, the far side is tough to visit because there's no
way to communicate directly with a lander, he said. You need an orbiter
to relay signals. One of the scariest parts of the Apollo 8 mission, he
said, was the period when astronauts flew behind the moon and lost all
contact with mission control.

But the radio darkness is a plus for some astrophysics quests, including
the detection of subtle radio waves emanating from deep space --- energy
remnants of the early universe that would be drowned out on Earth. And
so Chang'e-4 also carries a prototype for the kind of lunar radio
telescope that might one day be built on a larger scale.

[The U.S. is still the unquestioned leader in space exploration --- the
Chinese landing came just two days after an American probe's spectacular
flyby of an icy body 6.6 billion km away, called Ultima Thule, which
qualifies as the most distant object ever reached by spacecraft. The
same NASA craft, New Horizons, had a close encounter with Pluto in 2015.
But the moon is a place astronauts might go, and so Chang'e-4 has
spurred talk of a new space race.]{.underline}

The experts I spoke to were keen to send astronauts back to the moon,
though preferably not as part of an unfriendly international
competition. Planetary scientist Clive Neal of Notre Dame said that
space races aren't sustainable in the long term. The Apollo missions
were world-changing but ended after just a few years. Now, informed by
history, he said, we could go about a more collaborative program that
would get astronauts to the moon and beyond.

While sending people to the moon might seem like a modest goal compared
with a trip to Mars, learning to live on the moon would help scientists
learn how to keep humans alive and healthy on longer journeys. There are
known deposits of water ice on the moon, said Neal, and depending on its
purity, these might supply a moon base with water or be separated into
hydrogen and oxygen and used to fuel a Mars mission.

**[Humanity would get farther faster and would gather more scientific
wisdom by international collaboration than by space racing, but Congress
currently restricts NASA collaboration with the Chinese under what's
known as the Wolf amendment, introduced by Virginia congressman Frank
Wolf. The rationale was prevention of espionage. There were concerns
over Chinese hacking and a Chinese scientist who left a NASA facility
with an unauthorized laptop. Time magazine reported that the laptop
contained pornography and pirated movies but no national
secrets.]{.underline}**

Jacobson said it's worth noting the symbolism of where the Chinese chose
to land on the moon: the crater-within-a-crater named after Theodore von
Karman, who was the head of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a mentor
to a young Chinese researcher --- Hsue-Shen Tsien --- who became one of
the world's great rocket scientists. The two worked together before and
during World War II, and Tsien is now recognized for making a major
contribution to the U.S. space program.

But after the war, common enemies no longer sustained the alliance, and
in the 1950s, during the communist scare, Tsien was interrogated, put
under house arrest for five years and then deported. Upon release, he
headed the Chinese nuclear weapons program, putting it on the fast track
to nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.

[Could sending the Chinese spacecraft to the Von Karman crater be an
intentional gesture of reconciliation and hope for further cooperation?
Perhaps it's just a coincidence, but one that can serve as a reminder of
the collaboration that gave birth to space travel in the first
place.]{.underline}

#### Wolf amendment overturn is key to space collaboration

[The Pentagon's recent aggressive focus on fighting and winning a space
war may make for great news stories and science fiction, but it's lousy
policy. While the situation in space has changed, in many ways for the
worse, moving to an offensive strategy is a dangerous
overreaction.]{.underline}

How did we get here? Both the tenor of public comments and the details
of policies about space war shifted considerably after the 2014 Space
Strategic Portfolio Review (SPR). Senior Pentagon officials argued that
the strategic environment had changed, requiring a different approach to
maintain the stability required by all space actors --- most of all the
US --- to fully utilize their space assets. That's right --- as far as
it goes: The environment has changed, but in more ways than considered
by the narrowly focused SPR. The aggressive approach undertaken by the
military rests on incomplete premises and carries a significant chance
of being counterproductive if space stability is the goal.

WorldView 3 satelliteThe most dramatic and disturbing change? In May
2013 China launched what it claimed was a science mission that nearly
reached geosynchronous orbit, some 36,000 miles above Earth. That orbit,
previously considered a sanctuary from threats because it was beyond the
reach of any but the most advanced space players, houses key US space
security assets. That Chinese action triggered the SPR, the results of
which reached all the way to the White House --- unusual for a subject
often considered too technical and esoteric for the humanities majors in
the West Wing.

The 2013 launch was part of a steady increase in Chinese space
capabilities over the past decade. [China saw the advantages space
provided the US military in Desert Storm and has also studied the
economic, social and technical benefits of a human spaceflight
program]{.underline}. China has initiated programs to pursue those
benefits, all of which are dependent on access to space, guaranteed
through the Outer Space Treaty, which both the US and China signed. Both
of those countries, however, may see their access threatened by the US
change of posture.

Russia has also been reviving its once powerful space program, testing
(along with China) maneuverable satellites in low-Earth orbit, a feat
only the United States could previously manage. Vladimir Putin's regime
reorganized the Russian Air Force and Russian Aerospace Defense Forces
in 2015 to increase the bureaucratic clout of the Russian Space Forces.
Putin has used US dependence on Russian transportation to the
International Space Station as a pawn during tensions over Crimea.
Together, this Russian resurgence and rising Chinese aspirations and
capabilities have exposed sensitive nerves in the Pentagon and
Intelligence Community.

The findings of the Space Posture Review have been bolstered and
supplemented by the assumptions that the risk of escalation of conflict
in space --- potentially, escalation to the nuclear level --- can be
controlled. But limited information drawn from classified space war
games suggests otherwise. It's dangerous to assume that China or Russia
would agree with us on what constitutes escalation and what constitutes
proportionate response; that kind of understanding took decades to work
out in the nuclear realm, and assessing which satellites are "strategic"
or "tactical" targets is at least as complex. We can't rely on other
countries to understand US assumptions of how a limited space war might
be fought.

The timeline of Leonardo DRS's 50 years of innovation is peppered with
notable technologies and capabilities that have given militaries around
the world a warfighting edge. Here's a look.

The Russian and Chinese space postures aren't the only changes in the
space environment. After decades of wishing for a robust commercial
space industry that does not depend on government contracts, it's
finally happening. Companies like Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are
developing low-cost space transportation systems. Companies like Bigelow
Space are developing expandable space habitats, and Deep Space
Industries and Planetary Resources are working on plans and capabilities
for space mining. These "New Space" companies may well facilitate the
development of space much as the railroads helped develop the American
West.

None of those significant space players --- representatives of the
commercial sector --- was included in the SPR, which was led by the
National Security Council. The review didn't even include traditional
civilian players like NASA Instead, the SPR included only the military
and intelligence communities, and it focused almost exclusively on
deterrence by punishment. A more inclusive consideration of the space
environment might well yield a very different picture of the threats,
risks and opportunities.

Unfortunately, the structural inertia that supports and, indeed,
advocates, aggressive space postures requiring expensive weapon systems
is strong. The aerospace military-industrial complex that President
Dwight D. Eisenhower worried about is alive and well, staffed by
individuals who thrive in the revolving door of corporations, the
military, lobbying groups and think tanks. Congressional support for
their efforts is easily garnered, as building hardware creates lucrative
jobs and corporate profits, whereas diplomacy does not.

French Defense Minister Florence Parley says she has been exploring with
French defense giant Thales concepts for what she called "fearsome
little detectors" that "will be the eyes of our most valuable
satellites."

Try Diplomacy

[But if the goal of US space security efforts is to maintain stability
in space so it can fully utilize its space assets, then the time seems
ripe for proactive diplomatic leadership and, at the same time,
sustained strategic restrain]{.underline}t. Otherwise, the US will be
seen (not for the first time) as advocating a policy of
do-as-we-say-and-not-as-we-do regarding pursuit of offensive space
capabilities. The problem with restraint is that progress is slow and,
as with nuclear deterrence, it's hard to tell if you're succeeding or
not (unless things go apocalyptically wrong). Therefore[, it is
imperative that restraint be coupled with pro-active and aggressive
diplomatic leadership and multi-tiered deterrence.]{.underline}

A key aspect of these diplomatic efforts must be our coming to terms
with China. [The Wolf Amendment that banned US-China bilateral space
relations since 2011 has effectively promoted the notion of a US-China
space race]{.underline}. It also, of course, propelled China to develop
indigenous capabilities it might not have otherwise. With passage of the
amendment, the US took careful aim and shot itself in the foot. [There
may still be an opportunity to use space as a bridge to better overall
relations with China.]{.underline}

One model is how the US and Russia have managed to maintain a working
relationship on the International Space Station during even the most
tense of political times. It demonstrates the geopolitical value of
cooperation when both parties have a vested interest in success. [Both
China and the US have Mars plans. A joint mission could serve as part of
a larger "grand bargain" with China. The leadership aspects of the
mission alone make consideration worthwhile]{.underline}.

While the drumbeat of Pentagon rhetoric regarding space warfare that
originally accompanied the SPR has toned down since its release, the
aggressive plans, development of capabilities and systems -- and the
resources committed to such -- continue. [Strategy requires keeping an
eye on the goal. If space stability is the goal there is a serious
misalignment between means and ends. Addressing that misalignment must
be a US priority.]{.underline}

Despite recent developments in cultural and economic relations between
[China and Taiwan]{.underline}, the two [have also been engaged in
increased military rivalry.]{.underline} [In June **[the
P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy**]{.underline} (PLA:
China's Army) **[[conducted simulation attack against
Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}**[\[1\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn1) The
Taiwanese then soon performed their own defensive exercise against
China.[\[2\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn2) [The
Taiwanese Democratic Progress Party]{.underline} (TDPP), which is almost
certain to win in the coming national election in 2016, [has a
fundamental policy for independence, which will definitely strain
Taipei-Beijing
relations]{.underline}.[\[3\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn3) **[[In
case the confrontation results in a military conflict, the US will have
trouble]{.mark} not only [with freedom of navigation around
Taiwan]{.mark}, but will also have to make the choice of whether it
abandons Taiwan or not.]{.underline}** For more than a half century, the
United States has been able to help deter the use of force by China and
Taiwan. In 2004, a visiting researcher at Kyoto University stated that
it is U.S. forces supported by Japan's Emergency-at-Periphery Law of
1999, which deterred China's invasion of
Taiwan.[\[4\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn4) However,
the international security environment in 2015 has changed since then
Today **[China is trying to establish its own regional hegemony,
therefore resulting in a bilateral rivalry between China and the United
States]{.underline}**.[\[5\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn5) In
fact, [the change in the security environment around Taiwan, now covered
by China's Anti-Access/Area-Denial (A2AD) Strategy, makes it obvious
that [the US can no longer easily deploy]{.mark} its [aircraft
carriers]{.mark} there; this is [due to concerns about
escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the US should maintain
its commitment to Taiwan to maintain stability in East Asia. [[US
withdrawal from]{.mark} its [commitment towards Taiwan will
generate]{.mark} much negative effect, such as [regional
arms-race]{.mark} involving other nations suppressed by
China]{.underline}. To find a Pareto optimal approach to the situation
**[[the US has to keep supporting Taiwan militarily, and also
maintaining US forces' posture to relegate China]{.mark} at least out of
the East Coast of Taiwan within a frame of limited war.]{.underline}**
In short, US Strategic Ambiguity needs to become a little more lucid.
After inauguration of Chen Shui-bian as the Taiwanese president in 2000,
China increased pressure on Chen by alluding to possible use of force
against
Taiwan.[\[6\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn6) In
response to that pressure, Chen stated that there was no doubt about the
fact Taiwan belonged to the Taiwanese people, and the public mood for
independence rose in Taiwan from 2003 through
2004.[\[7\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn7)After
those political exchanges between China and Taiwan[, [China
established]{.mark} the 2005 Anti-Secession]{.underline}
Law.[\[8\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn8) [This
Law stipulates that reunification with Taiwan is a domestic matter, and
that no foreign power should intervene in it.]{.underline} Additionally,
**[the Law articulates China's [right to use force against
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**:[\[9\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn9)
Article 8: In the event that the "Taiwan independence" secessionist
forces should act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of
Taiwan's secession from China, or that major incidents entailing
Taiwan's secession from China should occur, or that possibilities for a
peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted, the state shall
employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. **[Thus since 2005 [China
has kept the possibility of attacking Taiwan on the table]{.mark} as a
possible course of action, [should Taiwan show will]{.mark} or movement
[towards independence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The increasing military
gap between China and Taiwan will work as a variable to influence a
future possible military conflict between them. [As to China's military
strength, it is obvious that China enhances it year by year. IHS Jane,
an international defense review, estimates [China's military
budget]{.mark} in 2015 to [amount to 141.6 billion dollars]{.mark},
which is [a 10.1% growth from the previous yea]{.mark}r, and a double in
comparison with the military budget of
2008]{.underline}.[^\[10\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn10) **[[The]{.mark}

its military size]{.mark}, following Taiwan's defense policy for the

In 2005, the Taiwanese Army maintained 200,000 soldiers vis-a-vis
375,000 PLA soldiers over the Taiwan Strait. The Taiwanese Navy
maintained 27 combat vessels against 47 of the PLA Navy (PLAN), and the
Taiwanese Air Force maintained 420 combat aircrafts against 1,500 of the
PLA Air Force
(PLAA).[^\[13\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn13) When
comparing the numbers of the military branches of each force ten years
later (2015), we notice that the gap has widened more to China's favor:
**[130,000 Taiwanese soldiers face 400,000 PLA soldiers, 27 Taiwanese
warships with 67 on the PLAN side, and 388 Taiwanese combat aircrafts
with 1,700 PLAA
aircrafts]{.underline}**.[^\[14\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn14) [**[If
these gaps increase in the future]{.mark} and [China gains more]{.mark}
military [leverage over Taiwan]{.mark}, China's opportunity cost for
military invasion of Taiwan will decrease**. Since the decreased cost
for the invasion of Taiwan lowers the hurdle for China to use force
against Taiwan, **[the possibility of China's use of force against
Taiwan will rise]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### China's domestic Arm Sales marker is hyper-competitive, and China is interested in selling Jet Powered UAVs.

"The Zhuhai Airshow Confirms China's Emergence as a Defense Industrial
Power," World Politics Review, December 7, 2018,

//)2simmz

Although officially called an airshow, [the Zhuhai]{.underline}
exhibition is of far greater significance, serving as the
highest-profile venue for China's increasingly sophisticated and rapidly
growing aerospace and [defense industrial
sectors](https://www.iiss.org/blogs/military-balance/2018/08/china-global-defence-industry-league).
The [airshow is also somewhat unusual in that the majority of
participants are Chinese companies.]{.underline} In part, this [**is a
function of the arms embargo imposed on China by the United States and
the European Union**, as well as the export controls the U.S. and EU put
in place for component systems]{.underline}. At the same time, it is a
testament to China's growing self-sufficiency in modern armaments. The
earliest iterations of the Zhuhai airshow, which was first held in 1996,
were blips on the radar of the multibillion-dollar international
aerospace and arms industries, mainly showcasing China's many major
shortcomings in both military and civilian aerospace technology. Since
then, [subsequent editions have served as a powerful indicator of
[China's]{.mark} rapid technological advances and the [growing]{.mark}
capacity of its [defense industry]{.mark} to [produce modern]{.mark}
military [equipment for]{.mark} both **[domestic and international
customers]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Although many of the systems displayed
this year were featured previously at Zhuhai, the repeat appearances
serve to demonstrate that **[China's defense industry continuously
[upgrades designs and]{.mark} complements these refined designs with new
[systems]{.mark}, components and technologies [to provide a]{.mark} more
comprehensive and [effective]{.mark} package of military
capabilities.]{.underline}** For these reasons, by tracking the products
and capabilities on display every two years, outside observers can
discern the greatly improved technological and industrial capacity at
the PLA's disposal at a time when [President Xi Jinping is pressing the
Chinese military to undertake radical reforms and transform itself
into [an elite
military](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/18215/pla-military-reforms-defense-power-with-chinese-characteristics) prepared
for war.]{.underline} Several highlights of the 2018 airshow in
particular are worth mentioning, beginning with the two indigenous
Chinese fighter jet designs that arguably stole the show. Following up
on its first public display at Zhuhai in 2016, the J-20 stealth fighter
took part in an aerobatic component of the show. In contrast to the
participation of the J-20 in 2016, when two aircraft performed a very
basic and tame fly-by over the exhibition ground, this year four J-20
fighters performed more complex aerial maneuvers. [Their performance
culminated on the last day, when two [J-20 fighters revealed]{.mark} the
[training missiles]{.mark} that they were carrying [inside]{.mark} their
[internal munition bays]{.mark}, core features of stealth aircraft
design.]{.underline} The participation of a larger contingent of J-20
fighters and **[[the]{.mark} public display of the [aircraft's
maneuverability signaled]{.mark} the [maturity of]{.mark} the J-20
fighter program, the [Chinese military's confidence in]{.mark} its
latest [capabilities, and Beijing's]{.mark} newfound
[transparency]{.mark} about some of these capabilities.]{.underline}**
Another major highlight was an indigenous J-10 fighter equipped with a
new variant of a domestic turbofan engine with thrust vectoring control,
or TVC, nozzles, enabling extreme aerobatic maneuvers that the new J-10
variant repeatedly put on display. [These impressive performances not
only displayed China's mastery of TVC technology, but also demonstrated
the maturity of the indigenous WS-10 turbofan engine.]{.underline} To
date, production units of the otherwise indigenous J-10 fighter jet have
been equipped with imported Russian AL-31 turbofan engines[. This year's
performance at Zhuhai suggests that China is fast weaning itself off its
long-running reliance on Russia for aircraft engines**. [China's defense
exports are]{.mark} growing in value and [capturing lucrative deals to
provide sensitive]{.mark} military [technologies such as
UAVs.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Other highlights continue a major trend
already witnessed in the last two airshows: [the remarkable number and
diversity of unmanned aerial vehicles---or UAVs, also known as
drones---developed and produced by China's aerospace
industry.]{.underline} China previously displayed relatively slow UAVs
suited for surveillance and light-attack roles, analogous to the United
States' well-known MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper designs. The new
Chinese models unveiled this year provide qualitatively distinct
capabilities. Specifically, [several armed [jet-powered stealth UAV
designs were on display]{.mark} this year, most of them [utilizing some
variation of]{.mark} the tailless ["flying wing" layout]{.mark} of
America's well-known manned B-2 stealth bomber [and]{.mark} several
[American stealth]{.mark} UAV [prototypes.]{.mark} The designs on
display at Zhuhai could perform reconnaissance and strike missions
closer to enemy airspace, making them an important part of both China's
growing power-projection capabilities as well as its anti-access/area
denial]{.underline}, or A2/AD, capabilities. [Although China is known to
have been working on stealth UAV designs [for several
years](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-25033155), **[the large
number of designs competing for Chinese]{.mark} military [contracts has
taken observers by surprise]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[the fact
that these systems are on display at an exhibition with a foreign
audience **is indicative of China's willingness to export them to any
interested state with the means to buy them**]{.mark}. This is [in
contrast to]{.mark} [the United States']{.mark} long-standing
self-imposed [constraints on the export of armed UAVs,]{.mark} something
the Trump administration has been [trying to
change](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/24715/separating-fact-from-hype-in-trump-s-new-policy-on-drone-exports) in
response to China's [rapidly
growing](https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/17692/china-is-suddenly-a-leading-exporter-of-armed-drones) exports
of UAVs. **China's defense industry has long used the international
profile of the airshow to also show off land and even naval
systems.**]{.underline} Notably, in addition to the usual diverse
collection of armored vehicles, artillery systems and missiles of all
types, [Chinese companies also displayed a large number of new unmanned
ground vehicles, some of them armed. This is in line with China's
broader pursuit of unmanned combat systems and again displays
**[Beijing's]{.mark} apparent [openness to exporting]{.mark} [armed
unmanned systems]{.mark}**.]{.underline}  Considering the aerial, ground
and naval systems on display, **[the Zhuhai airshow is clearly a
one-stop shopping experience, [offering militaries]{.mark} around the
world internationally [competitive equipment]{.mark} for essentially all
of their needs.]{.underline}** Moreover, the displays at [the 2018
Zhuhai airshow underscore the immense investments China has poured into
the scientific, engineering and manufacturing capacity required to
produce world-class armaments. [This]{.mark} sustained investment [is
making]{.mark} the **[Chinese military increasingly spoiled for
choice]{.mark}**, capable of selecting between two to three competing
domestic products for a given requirement.]{.underline} As just one
example, there are now around a dozen Chinese companies offering large
UAVs. Although this competitive environment is likely to foster
innovation and provide the Chinese military with better designs to
select from, it comes at a cost, and China may need to consolidate its
defense industry in the future. Until that occurs, [**companies that do
not win contracts from the PLA are likely to turn to the export
market.** This may lead Chinese companies to accelerate the
proliferation of advanced military technologies, such as armed UAVs and
missile systems.]{.underline} This month's Zhuhai airshow was the latest
indicator of China's emergence as a defense industrial power, one
capable of offering a wide range of technologically competitive military
wares for both the domestic and international market. China's defense
exports are growing in value and capturing lucrative deals to provide
sensitive military technologies such as UAVs, and the armaments
displayed at Zhuhai explain why.

#### China declared that they will invade Taiwan if they believe that Taiwan will claim independence or if there is political instability.

[China has stated the reunification of Taiwan is an important matter. On
the other hand, China emphasizes peaceful reunification is the best
option in China's Anti-Secession Law.]{.underline} **[Considering those
two facts, it seems that [China will use forces to reunify
Taiwan]{.mark} [only after careful consideration]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The annual report to Congress by the US Department of Defense analyzes
China's consideration to use forces against Taiwan. That report says
that [[China will attack Taiwan in one of the following cases]{.mark}:
Formal declaration of [Taiwanese independence]{.mark}, Undefined moves
toward Taiwanese independence, [Internal unrest in Taiwan]{.mark},
Taiwan's [acquisition of nuclear weapons]{.mark}, Indefinite delays in
the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue on unification, Foreign
intervention in Taiwan's internal affairs, and Foreign forces stationed
in
Taiwan.]{.underline}[[\[15\]]{.underline}](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn15)
Hence, **[if Taiwan meets one of those conditions, China will, according
to the above-mentioned analyses, attack or use forces against
Taiwan.]{.underline}** As a recent example in the Third Taiwan Strait
Crisis in 1995 and 1996, [China actually demonstrated its possible
military attack against Taiwan because China saw a condition, which
allowed China to use force.]{.underline} During that crisis, **[[China
regarded Lee Teng-hui's visit in the US as]{.mark} [a step toward
Taiwan's two-China policy, and]{.mark} decided to [use military measures
to pose a threat to
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[\[16\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn16)
When focusing on people's preference inside Taiwan, one of the
conditions is gradually being met. An indicator is the local election of
November 2014, where the [[Taiwanese people]{.mark} began
[favor]{.mark}ing the [pro-independence]{.mark} TDPP [with 47.5%]{.mark}
[of the votes]{.mark} defeating the one-China Kuomintang of China (KMT)
with their
40.7%.]{.underline}[[\[17\]]{.underline}](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn17)Moreover,
as a result of a census in April 2015, [[89.3% of the Taiwanese
people]{.mark} do not [regard themselves as]{.mark} Chinese but as
[Taiwanese]{.mark}, and [68% of people]{.mark} in Taiwan [think that
Taiwan is]{.mark} an [independent]{.mark} sovereign
country.]{.underline}[\[18\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn18)
It is unclear whether Taiwan will move towards independence or not after
Taiwan finishes its national election on 16 January
2016.[\[19\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn19) At
this time, [as Tsai Ing-wen, a leader of the TDPP, officially states
that the TDPP will maintain the current bilateral relations with China,
a possible new administration in Taiwan will not declare Taiwan's
independence if the TDPP
wins]{.underline}.[\[20\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn20) Yet,
there is a danger of new pro-independence civil movements being led by
the student movement in Taiwan, because of the TDPP leadership. There
was a recent students' movement of anti-China sentiments. It was the
Sunflower Movement (太陽花學運) in March 2014. Students, who were
against the pro-China policy led by President Ma Ying-jeou, occupied the
Taiwanese during that
movement.[\[21\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn21) Hidenori
Ijiri, a [Professor of Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, points out
an anti-China aspect of the Sunflower Movement with explanation of
features about the young Taiwanese people, who are called the Strawberry
Generation]{.underline}.[\[22\]](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn22) A
part of the public announcement of the Sunflower Movement articulates
that the movement is to protect Taiwan's democracy against China, and
that Taiwan should continue to pursue self-determination in spite of
China's
wishes.[^\[23\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn23)
[If a future movement results in unlimited activities towards
independence or insurgency in Taiwan, China would decide to use force
against Taiwan. The possibility is not low because a civil movement
coupled with young generations often shows unmeasurable
energy.]{.underline} China also experienced such a movement on 4 June
1989 in front of the Tiananmen Square. That is, **[it is reasonable that
China will fear an unlimited civil movement in Taiwan and attack it on a
basis of its domestic law.]{.underline}**

#### Taiwan acts as an unsinkable aircraft carrier that can intercept Chinese defense signals.

The US must have regarded Taiwan as a strategic importance in US
security strategy. The US did not recognize the importance of Taiwan
until the time when the Korean War broke out in 1950. Actually, the US
did not include Taiwan in US defense area in the Far East until the
occurrence of the Korean
War.[^\[34\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn34) However,
after Harry Truman's "Statement by the President on the Situation in
Korea," in which the president ordered the US Seventh Fleet to defend
Taiwan from China and to observe Taiwan's cease fire against China, the
US has kept its strong tie with
Taiwan.[^\[35\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn35) At
this time, [the US has practical relations with Taiwan based on the
TRA]{.underline}. In spite of US-Taiwan historical relations, to my best
knowledge, [US official strategic documents do not have specific policy
on Taiwan's defense]{.underline}. For instance, the "US National
Security Strategy in 2015" does not have concerns about Taiwan's defense
but ongoing issues in the South China Sea such as keeping the right of
freedom of
navigation.[^\[36\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn36) Additionally,
"A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Sea power," by the US Navy, the
Marine Corp and the Coast Guard, do not include anything about
Taiwan.[^\[37\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn37)
However, some researchers state that **[[US strategy]{.mark} towards
Taiwan's defense [is an indirect approach]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Dean
Chen, a lecturer at University of California, Santa Barbara, discusses
that US policy. Chen explains that **[[the US keeps]{.mark} [provision
of arms for Taiwan to]{.mark} promote its democracy and to [maintain
its]{.mark} [status against China, and]{.mark} the US works on Taiwan
[not to provoke China]{.mark}, such as persuading Taiwan not to declare
Taiwan's independence of
China]{.underline}**.[^[\[38\]]{.underline}^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn38) When
focusing on maintaining Taiwan's status against China, for instance
"Hard ROC 2.0: [Taiwan and Deterrence Through Protraction," offered by
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments (CSBA), actually suggests
**not US military protection of Taiwan but increasing Taiwan's own
deterrence by denial to keep Taiwan's position against
China**]{.underline}.[^[\[39\]]{.underline}^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn39) For
these reasons, one US strategy for Taiwan's defense is to increase
Taiwan's own deterrence against China. [It is still in question whether
the US will use force to protect Taiwan in case of a failure of Taiwan's
deterrence against China]{.underline}. As for US policy about Taiwan's
defense, the US does not state clearly its intension to defend Taiwan.
Joseph Bosco, a member of the U.S.-China task force at the Center for
the National Interest and a senior associate at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, insists that the US abandon its strategic
ambiguity on Taiwan and show its clear will to defend
Taiwan.[^\[40\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn40) On
the other hand Hugh White, a professor of strategic studies at the
Australian National University's Strategic and Defense Studies Centre,
states that Taiwan has no value for the US to defend it with costly
military
measurements.[^\[41\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn41) Furthermore,
[Charles Glaser, a professor in the Elliott School of International
Affairs and the Department of Political Science at George Washington
University, argues that the US should abandon Taiwan against China to
get a peaceful solution in the South China Sea and the East China Sea,
and to ensure China's consent about the future US presence in East
Asia]{.underline}.[^\[42\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn42)Because
of the current US ambiguity for using force and Taiwan's low-estimated
value, it is difficult to reach a plausible conclusion that the US will
protect Taiwan by military means. In terms of military strategy, **[in
the present Taiwan's values is not always crucial to the
US]{.underline}**. The following paragraphs discuss Taiwan's strategic
values from the two viewpoints: the first case in which [Taiwan enjoys
the present status quo and the second case that Taiwan becomes under
China's control.]{.underline} After analyzing those two situations,
**[it becomes clear that [Taiwan's value is not worth a total war
against China.]{.mark} As far as Taiwan maintains its present status
against China, [the US could improve its deterrence]{.mark} Mark Stokes,
the Executive Director of the Project 2049 Institute, and Russell Hsiao,
a senior research fellow at the institute, argue that [Taiwan's tactical
information is important to US military operations because Taiwan is
inside China's A2/AD
environmen]{.mark}t]{.underline}**.[^\[43\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn43) That
is, **[[Taiwan can collect so many acoustic signal]{.mark}s, electric
signals [and other information that the US will be able to know
essential information to conduct military
operations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For instance, **[if [the US]{.mark}
knows a part of malfunction of China's air-warning radar systems, it
[can exploit its small hole to intrude into
China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Additionally, Robert Kaplan points out
**[[Taiwan's geopolitical importance for the US to project its
power]{.mark} through Taiwan, [referring to it as the unsinkable
aircraft
carrier]{.mark}]{.underline}**.[^\[44\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn44)
If China reunified Taiwan, [US deterrence by both denial and punishment
would reduce its effectiveness because [the **PLA Navy**]{.mark}
**(PLAN) [would acquire]{.mark} easy [access to deep seas in the western
Pacific]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As to this issue, [Bosco points out that
**[China's submarines would be able to dive into the deep sea without
passing shallow waters from the east coast of Taiwan]{.mark}** --
although PLAN submarines likely have to keep their snorkels above the
sea surface from PLAN bases at China's east coast up to around Okinawa
islands'
line]{.underline}.[^\[45\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn45) Actually,
in the sea below lat. 24°30' N along the east coast of Taiwan, the sea
depth becomes more than 1000m within 12 nautical miles from the coast,
and it reaches more than 2000m at some places in that area. **[If
[China's submarines]{.mark} dived into such deep level shortly after
departing naval bases at Taiwan's east coast, it [would become difficult
to detect]{.mark} those submarines and locate their area of
probability.]{.underline}** As a result, [[US naval assets would
face]{.mark} much [threat]{.mark} against sudden attacks from China's
submarines. That US vulnerability against China's submarines will surely
degrade US deterrence against China]{.underline}. Especially if China's
strategic submarines would achieve easy access to the deep sea, China's
deterrence by punishment will improve owing to enhanced survivability of
the China's nuclear second-strike capability. [Taiwan's military values
are not sufficient to draw the US into a direct military conflict with
China to protect Taiwan.]{.underline} That is because the US can select
more reasonable options than defending Taiwan from China, while
maintaining the efficacy of US military strategy in the west Pacific
region. For instance, the US can use and develop its bases in Japan and
Philippines to regain US deterrence against China. If Taiwan became a
part of China, Japan and Philippines would welcome more US troops
because of their increased concerns against China. Additionally, in case
of Taiwan's surrender, the US could form alliances to encompass China as
Michael Pillsbury argues, and maintain US deterrence against
China.[^\[46\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn46)**[Thus,
a total war for defense of Taiwan is not a good option to the
US.]{.underline}**

#### US support of Taiwan forces the CCP to seek diplomatic solutions and maintains US assurances in the region.

The US should not and cannot fight a total war for Taiwan as mentioned
above. Nevertheless, **[the US will face a problem if it abandons
Taiwan[. If the US does not defend Taiwan]{.mark} at all, [other
countries in East Asia]{.mark} and South East Asia [will rush into
building strong military capability to deter
China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Although Glaser seems for abandoning
Taiwan, even he mentions possible objections from US allies. [That is
because US abandoning [it]{.mark}s commitment to Taiwan [would
deteriorate US credibility]{.mark} of defense commitments to
them]{.underline}.[^\[63\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn63)
[Glaser argues that the concern is overstated. His stance, however, is
mistaken because it is merely an **American defensive realist's view,
which does not see the problem from the perspective of other countries
around Taiwan. From a Japanese view, if the US abandons Taiwan, [it also
implies the]{.mark} future [possibility that the US would abandon  Japan
to tie up with China]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} In such a case [Japan
would]{.mark} have to consider [acquir]{.mark}ing [more effective
weapons, to]{.mark} deal [with]{.mark} potential [nuclear
blackmail]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the US does not protect small
democratic Taiwan from the current authoritarian China, [**other states
must recognize that the security environment in East Asia is based on
pure Realism**. Hence, they will prepare for a war to defend their land,
thereby accelerating a dangerous arms-race.]{.underline} That arms-race
may not be a direct threat to the US; however, [the US will have to
invest much in deterrence cost to enjoy freedom of navigation in East
Asia.]{.underline} In sum, the US has to select a Pareto optimal answer
between selling Taiwan, and total war for Taiwan. **[The point is how
the US supports Taiwan to improve its deterrence by
denial.]{.underline}** That is because [Taiwan's deterrence by
punishment will not only invoke China's attacks but also be useless
against China's surprise attacks.]{.underline} [The best weaponry to
enhance deterrence by punishment is nuclear weapons; however, it will
prompt China's attacks against Taiwan]{.underline}. [[If Taiwan gets
A-bombs]{.mark}, [China will invade Taiwan]{.mark} as the US Navy
assumes]{.underline}.[^\[64\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn64)Moreover,
**[only if Taiwan tries to acquire A-bombs, it is natural to expect that
China will immediately attack Taiwan because Taiwan's acquisition of
nuclear weapons will force China to live with the situation of mutual
assured destruction against Taiwan.]{.underline}** Thus, [China will
destroy Taiwan's military capability before it is too late.]{.underline}
Other assets like a large surface combatants and combat aircrafts are
useful to improve deterrence by punishment; nevertheless, they will be
useless in Taiwan's case because of their vulnerability against China's
surprise attacks albeit their high costs. In terms of surprise attacks,
the most important point is [Taiwan would have difficulty detecting
signs of China's attacks due to its proximity to China. For instance,
sudden attacks by China's short range ballistic missiles are effective
to destroy Taiwan's
forces.]{.underline}[^[\[65\]]{.underline}^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn65) For
instance,  China has CSS-6 variant short range ballistic missiles with
range of 950 km and the circular error probable of 10 to 30
m.[^\[66\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn66) It
means that those [[CSS-6s can hit the Taiwanese navy's]{.mark} Oliver
Hazard Perry class [surface combatants]{.mark}, length: 133.5 m and
beam: 13.5 m, if they are moored in a
base]{.underline}.[^\[67\]^](https://inpec.wordpress.com/2015/11/07/nakazawa/#_edn67) [It
is the same story about Taiwanese runways, combat aircrafts, radar sites
and other important facilities.]{.underline} As this estimation
explains, large assets for deterrence by punishment are useless in spite
of their high costs to acquire and maintain. Hence, **[[Taiwan should
improve its defensive capability to enhance deterrence by
denial]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Yet, Taiwan alone would not achieve such
strong deterrence because it is so small against China and surrounded by
the ocean. Hence, [the US needs to support Taiwan's efforts to gain its
deterrence. The US need to protect the east area of Taiwan for the
purpose of the Taiwanese guerrilla warfare base.]{.underline} **[The US
will not commit a total war against China; therefore, preparation for a
total war is not efficient in terms of deterrence]{.underline}**. That
is because logically little will to conduct a total war does not ensure
enough deterrence. Yet, it will be able to take limited options like
combinations from military aid and a limited war against China.
Additionally[, the US cannot expect much against Japan because Japan
does not have a domestic law like the US TRA and has official policy not
to touch the Cross Strait Issue.]{.underline} Thus, possible US options
are as follows: 1) only military aid, 2) military aid and maintenance of
US posture to fight a limited war, and 3) official treaty to defense
Taiwan's east coast. Since this paper is not a policy paper, it
summarizes each option. The first option of military aid is doubtful in
terms of efficacy because neither the US nor Taiwan could get
appropriate profit against cost for military equipment. [Military aid
alone will not improve Taiwanese deterrence by denial, due to large
weaponry's vulnerability against China's surprise attacks.]{.underline}
After losing all large weapons, Taiwan would keep its small arms safe
and use them for guerrilla warfare against China. Yet, [if China invades
Taiwan from all directions, the survived Taiwan's army will have to
withdraw into the middle mountainous area.]{.underline} That Taiwanese
army will be able to do little operations. Sooner or later that
Taiwanese army will suffer from the lack of food and weaponry as Japan
did in Philippines and many other battle fields in South East Asia.
Thus, [no matter how much weaponry Taiwan received from the US, it alone
would not improve Taiwan's deterrence by denial.]{.underline} The second
option, **[[military aid and implication of US protection]{.mark} of the
east side of Taiwan, [is effective because the US can avoid complete
competition with China]{.mark} [and keep a frame of limited war while
enhancing Taiwan's deterrence by denial]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [US
[aircraft carriers will be able to support Taiwanese military]{.mark} in
the east side of Taiwan, [controlling escalation]{.mark} by avoiding
China's attacks on them.]{.underline} Additionally, [**[US submarines
will not need to be afraid of China's mines]{.mark} so much in the deep
seas in the east side of Taiwan**. Even such [limited US operations will
contribute to]{.mark} the [Taiwanese]{.mark} forces' [resilience and
sustainability]{.mark}. That is because US-Taiwan superiority in the
east coast of Taiwan will reduce possibility of China's attacks from
that direction, thereby increasing Taiwanese forces' capability to
continue a protracted war against China. **That [US support will also
encourage Taiwanese moral]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words,
[Taiwanese forces will be able to keep attacking China's invaders for a
long time like the North Vietnamese guerrilla warfare against US forces,
using protected Taiwan's east coast as a foundation of anti-China
war.]{.underline} **[[This foundation will increase Taiwan's deterrence
by denial based on asymmetric and protracted warfare]{.mark} as offered
by CSBA]{.underline}**. That is, if PLA forces come from the west coast
of Taiwan, Chinese landing troops will face Taiwanese guerrilla warfare
units from the eastern part of Taiwan. In that case, [**as China has to
bear a protracted war against Taiwanese forces like the US experienced
in Iraq, [China's opportunity cost to invade Taiwan will
increases]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The [increased cost]{.mark} [will force
China's leaders to seek]{.mark} other [political solutions against
Taiwan]{.mark} than use of force.]{.underline} Hence, [increasing
possibility of US limited military intervention will increase Taiwan's
deterrence by denial against China and reduce possibility of China's
invasion of Taiwan, thereby sustaining the stability around Taiwan.
**[This stability will reduce a danger of arms-race in East Asia]{.mark}
as well. As far as the US implies its possible military intervention in
a Sino-Taiwanese conflict albeit limited defensive operations, other
countries feel safe against China's aggression and no necessity to
launch costly and dangerous arms-race.**]{.underline} This second option
is good in practice inside and outside the US. As for US domestic
politics, [this option is more probable than abandoning Taiwan's defense
because it has at least a concept to defense democratic country in a
direct manner as last resort]{.underline}. US citizens will support this
option better than mere military aid. Additionally, it is possible that
the US can imply its intention to defend Taiwan without clear
statements. If the US organizes and develops specific military
capability for defense of Taiwan in East Asia, China will assume US
intention and count it into China's decision making process.
International trainings by the US and allies will contribute US
implication to China. Thus, the US can let China assume US possibility
to intervene without clearly speaking its intention and directly
confronting China.

## Case 

### China

#### Ending arms sales to Taiwan would not do good to China, Taiwan, or the US.

[Shelley **Rigger 11**, 11-29-2011, \"Why giving up Taiwan will not help
us with China,\" AEI,]{.underline}
<http://www.aei.org/publication/why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china>[,
CS]{.underline}

Maintaining constructive relationships with both Beijing and Taipei is a
perpetual challenge for American leaders. With the end of the Cold War
and the rise of a strong, globally engaged China, some American policy
analysts have begun to question whether the delicately balanced Taiwan
policy the United States has followed since the late 1970s still serves
US interests. According to these observers, US defense assistance
prevents Taipei from making hard decisions about its future and
undermines a much more important relationship---the one between the
United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC). Therefore, they
argue, the United States needs to phase out that aid and let Taiwan and
China work through their relationship without US interference. These
arguments promise a magic-bullet solution to one of the most intractable
problems in US foreign relations, so it is not surprising that they have
received a lot of attention. As persuasive it may be on its face, the
case for rethinking US Taiwan policy and, more specifically, withdrawing
American security assistance, is overstated. [Such a policy change would
not serve the interests of the United States, Taiwan, or China; nor
would it solve the problems its proponents claim they want to
address.]{.underline}

Key points in this *Outlook*:  [\
•  In the face of a rising China, US analysts are increasingly calling
on Washington to rethink its Taiwan policy, but withdrawing US support
would serve neither China, Taiwan, nor the United States.\
•  Phasing out US security assistance to Taiwan would not only undermine
vital security architecture in the Asia-Pacific region but also send a
chilling message to our democratic allies around the world that American
friendship is fickle.\
•  Instead of satisfying Beijing, a change in US Taiwan policy could
raise China's expectations without making peaceful cross-strait
unification any easier, further damaging US-China
relations.]{.underline}

#### No US-China war. The fear of war is uncalled for and incorrect.

[Zhengxu **Wang 18,** 12/25/18, \"US paranoia is fuelling talk of war,
not China's 'rise',\" South China Morning Post,]{.underline}

CS]{.underline}

[In the same conversation mentioned above, when asked by Allison about
the possibility of a war between China and the US, Lee Kuan Yew's answer
was a categorical "no". He did not see China as having any interest in
contesting US primacy and changing the world.\
"The China that is rising is coming to get us" -- such a mentality would
probably lead to fulfillment of the Thucydides Trap thesis. That is the
kind of thinking that has turned the US into a highly insecure and
paranoid actor today.]{.underline}

And the US "ruling" the world is an imagined fact as well. [Having got
this straight, the US should be able to dispel its fear of being
displaced, and work with China and everyone else to build a common
future for the world.]{.underline}

#### The US is unwilling to bargain with China---their evidence doesn't assume China's increased cyber espionage, Xi's lack of transparency on security agreements, and his continual push for expansion in the region. This means that any terms the US and China agree to are likely going to be circumvented by Xi.

In true showmanship fashion, U.S. President Donald Trump is keeping the
world in suspense about whether he will soon double down on the United
States' [trade
war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-03-22/better-way-challenge-china-trade) with
China or call a truce. The big reveal will come after his meeting with
Chinese President Xi Jinping on the margins of the G-20 in Buenos Aires
later this week. Trump has at times been
optimistic, [telling](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46242732) reporters,
"I think a deal will be made. We'll find out very soon." Don't believe
the hype. [**[Any agreement]{.mark}** in Argentina **[will be a tactical
pause]{.mark} at best**, providing short-term relief to jittery stock
markets and beleaguered U.S. farmers, **but [having no]{.mark} material
or [long-lasting effect on]{.mark} the slide toward a [high-stakes
geopolitical competition]{.mark} between the United States and China**.
The days when the world's two largest economies could meet each other
halfway have gone.]{.underline} Over the course of his first five-year
term, [**[Xi passed up repeated opportunities to avert rivalry with
Washington.]{.underline}** [His]{.underline}]{.mark} [increasingly
**revisionist and [authoritarian turn]{.mark}** has instead
**[eliminated the possibility of a grand bargain between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and China**]{.underline}. On most issues
of consequence, **[[there is]{.mark} simply [no overlap between Xi's
vision for China's]{.mark} rise [and what the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [considers]{.mark} an [acceptable]{.mark} future [for
Asia]{.mark} and the world beyond.]{.underline}** Whether Trump and Xi
reach some short-term accommodation in Buenos Aires is anyone's guess.
There are substantial divisions within the Trump administration and no
policy process to adjudicate them. As a result, the White House has
neither an agreed-upon bottom line nor a clear negotiating strategy.
[Bilateral [negotiations have been flailing]{.mark} in fits and starts,
leaving China guessing what might ultimately satisfy Trump.]{.underline}
The meeting in Buenos Aires may well fail to curb the president's
appetite for more tariffs on China. Over the last year, **[the
[Trump]{.mark} administration has [substantially hardened its
policies]{.mark} and rhetoric [toward
Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Consider, for example, Vice President
Mike Pence's
blistering [speech](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-vice-president-pence-administrations-policy-toward-china/) at
the Hudson Institute in October, in which he accused China of a litany
of economic, political, and military misdeeds. Pence continued his
strident tone while substituting for Trump at Asia's annual regional
summits in mid-November. [The vice president
openly [mocked](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apec-summit-usa/pence-vows-no-end-to-tariffs-until-china-bows-idUSKCN1NM04K) Xi's
signature foreign policy program, the Belt and Road Initiative,
declaring that the United States, by contrast, does not "offer
constricting belts or a one-way road.]{.underline}" In the meantime, the
Trump administration has [stepped
up](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/with-new-indictments-us-launches-aggressive-campaign-to-thwart-chinas-economic-attacks/2018/11/01/70dc5572-dd78-11e8-b732-3c72cbf131f2_story.html?utm_term=.ed6a456b7588) pressure
on Beijing with a series of indictments and financial penalties to blunt
China's illegal and unfair trade practices.  All that said, it is widely
known that Trump is of two minds on China. Even as the
president [reiterates](https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2165733/donald-trump-insists-he-wont-meet-iranian-president) his
long-standing belief that China has "cheated" and "plundered" the United
States, no one should be surprised if he chooses to make a deal, declare
victory, and go home. By earning symbolic and politically salient
concessions, Trump could minimize short-term risks to U.S. markets while
claiming that he alone finally stood up to Beijing. The contours of such
a deal are well understood. Trump would agree to hit pause on any new or
higher tariffs. In exchange, China would pledge to purchase more U.S.
goods (including soy beans and liquefied natural gas), while issuing
promises to enhance Chinese market access for U.S. products, further
open its financial sector, better protect intellectual property, and
reduce joint venture and technology transfer requirements. [Any burst of
goodwill, however, will be short lived. **Xi and [the]{.mark} ruling
[C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist [P]{.mark}arty [are
incapable]{.mark} [of addressing]{.mark} the United States' [fundamental
concerns over China's]{.mark} industrial policies and [state-led
economic model]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Because of this, any process to
settle these issues is bound to fail. Even if tariffs are put on hold,
the United States will continue to restructure the U.S.-Chinese economic
relationship through investment restrictions, export controls, and
sustained law enforcement actions against Chinese industrial and
cyber-espionage. At the same time, **[[there are no]{.mark} serious
[prospects for Washington]{.mark} and [Beijing to resolve]{.mark} other
[important areas of dispute, including the South China Sea]{.mark},
human rights, and the larger contest over the norms, rules, [and
institutions that govern relations in Asia]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Nothing Trump and Xi agree to in Argentina will substantially alter this
course. Historians will debate why Xi so mishandled the U.S.-Chinese
relationship, likely finding some combination of ideology, certitude of
a declining United States, and domestic exigencies that had nothing to
do with foreign policy. Regardless, **[[the record is]{.mark} now [clear
that Xi,]{.mark} whether intentionally or not, decisively
[sidestepped]{.mark} what was [China's]{.mark} best and last
[opportunity to avert rivalry with Washington]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
When Xi assumed China's presidency in 2013, U.S. President Barack
[Obama's administration was willing to test the proposition that Xi was
both a reformer and someone the United States could work with. The
leaders rolled up their sleeves at Sunnylands in June 2013 to begin
charting a future course for what both sides referred to as the world's
most important bilateral relationship.]{.underline} With tensions
simmering between the powers, this was a potentially crucial turning
point. At the Communist Party's Third Plenum conclave later that year,
Xi said all the right things about taking China further down the path of
reform, including letting the market play a "[decisive
role](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-24910434)" in the
economy. In turn, [[Obama welcomed China's rising power]{.mark}, viewed
it as natural and legitimate, and ultimately saw Beijing as a partner on
issues including climate change and nuclear nonproliferation. **Members
of Obama's cabinet said repeatedly that U.S.-Chinese cooperation was
necessary to address the globe's most pressing problems, with Obama
himself
making [clear](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/obama-china-weak-and-strong) that
he thought a strong China was preferable to a weak one.**]{.underline}
Obama did push back on China, for instance by underscoring U.S. alliance
commitments to Japan and the Philippines to deter China's assertiveness
in its maritime periphery. But he did so selectively and intermittently,
and never in ways that threatened to undermine China's core interests or
the bilateral relationship. Toward the end of the Obama administration,
the president directed his cabinet to begin strategic stability talks
with Beijing, believing that dialogue was still the principal means to
manage mounting competition. Yet, [[at nearly every turn, Xi rejected
Obama's overtures]{.mark} in areas of significant dispute. Instead of
seeking to narrow differences, [**Xi accelerated China's efforts to
develop an illiberal sphere of influence in ways that increasingly
undermined vital U.S. interests**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [While
Washington negotiated in good faith, **Beijing dragged its feet for
years on a bilateral investment treaty that would have addressed many
issues at the root of today's trade war**.]{.underline} At the same
time, Xi reasserted state control over China's economy, failing to
deliver much-needed reforms that would have created a more reciprocal
economic relationship. [And [after the Chinese government pledged to
cease]{.mark} and desist on [cyber]{.mark} commercial [espionage in
2015]{.mark}, [U.S. intelligence]{.mark}
officials [[determined](https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/415802-nsa-official-china-violating-agreement-on-cyber-economic-espionage) that
China was back to its old ways within a couple of years**.**]{.mark}
**[On security issues, Xi was equally uncompromising]{.mark}.** [In
2015, he]{.mark}
famously [[lied]{.mark}](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-pacific/xi-denies-china-turning-artificial-islands-into-military-bases-idUSKCN0RP1ZH20150925) in
the White House Rose Garden [that China had "no intention to militarize"
the South China Sea]{.mark}. In reality, he was planning to build
artificial islands with military bases the size of Pearl
Harbor.]{.underline} Wielding a large
economic [stick](https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/chinas-use-of-coercive-economic-measures),
Xi used boycotts and travel bans to punish U.S. allies, including South
Korea and the Philippines, for standing up for themselves and further
aligning with the United States. He exacted extraordinary pressure on
Taiwan, calling off a diplomatic truce and peeling off some of Taipei's
few remaining diplomatic partners. Internally, [his record on human
rights has been abysmal, exemplified by the estimated one million
Muslims sent to internment camps in western China**. [By the 2016
presidential election, Xi had lost the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.
Regardless of whether Trump or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton had
taken the helm, Washington was readying to challenge China on multiple
fronts.**]{.underline} Even much of [the U.S. business community---long
considered the ballast of the U.S.-Chinese relationship---had had
enough, and was newly willing to see Washington take punitive actions
against Beijing.]{.underline} An emerging bipartisan consensus on
Capitol Hill only reinforced the likelihood that the United States would
confront China on trade, opioids, cybertheft, and human rights.

representatives to voice their support for Taiwan joining the UN when it
meets for its general assembly in September. St Vincent and the
Grenadines secured its seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security
Council just last month. [Beijing has already voiced its anger at Tsai's
stopover in New York, where the UN has its headquarters, and urged
Washington to remember its commitment to the "one China" policy and the
"three communiqués" that underline relations between the US and mainland
China.]{.underline} Since becoming president in 2016, **[[Tsai has made
numerous trips to the US]{.mark} as preambles to diplomatic tours of the
Caribbean. Her most recent was in March, when she spent a day in 
[Hawaii](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3003577/hawaii-stopover-taiwan-president-tsai-ing-wen-warns-hong-kong).]{.underline}**
The tension surrounding her latest visit was played out on the streets
of New York, where police had to maintain order as [hundreds of people
who had turned out to greet her became involved in a slanging match and
scuffles with a group of pro-Beijingers, according to local media
reports.]{.underline} Beijing, which considers Taiwan a wayward province
awaiting reunification with the mainland, has repeatedly warned
Washington against welcoming the president of the self-ruled island or
supplying it with arms. Tsai's trip came just days after the US approved
the sale of  [US\$2.2
billion](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3017801/biggest-arms-sale-taiwan-donald-trumps-presidency-shows) worth

Fan Shih-ping, a professor of political science at National Taiwan
Normal University, said in reference to both the arms deal and the
diplomatic reception.]{.underline} On Friday, Tsai was expected to
attend a meeting organized by the US-Taiwan Business Council and the
Taiwan External Trade Development Council, and a seminar with academics
from Columbia University. [She is also set to meet a number of US
politicians and a group of Taiwanese students before heading to Haiti on
Saturday]{.underline}.

#### Alt Cause---John Bolton has been meeting with Taiwan's national security chief

Taiwan and U.S. security officials," Reuters, May 26, 2019,

TAIPEI (Reuters) - [**China responded angrily on Monday as [Taiwan
confirmed]{.mark} the first meeting in more than four decades between
senior U.S. and Taiwanese security officials**. **[Taiwan's]{.mark}
national [security chief]{.mark} David Lee [met]{.mark} White House
national security adviser [John Bolton]{.mark} earlier this month**, the
island's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement on
Saturday.]{.underline} The official Central News Agency said the meeting
was the first since the island and the United States ended formal
diplomatic ties in 1979. [China considers Taiwan a wayward province, to
be reclaimed by force if necessary, and the meeting angered Beijing
which is already locked in a bitter trade war with Washington. **"[China
is]{.mark} extremely dissatisfied and [resolutely opposed to
this]{.mark}**," Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a daily news
briefing]{.underline}, adding China was against any form of official
exchanges between the United States and Taiwan. The diplomatic ties
between Beijing and Washington have become increasingly strained in
recent weeks due to an escalating trade war, U.S. support for Taiwan and
China's muscular military posture in the South China Sea, where the
United States also conducts freedom-of-navigation patrols. The rare
meeting will be viewed by Taiwan as a sign of support from the Trump
administration. [Tensions have also risen between Taipei and Beijing,
which considers the democratically ruled island part of "one China". The
meeting took place during Lee's May 13-21 visit to the United States,
Taiwan's brief statement said. "**During the trip, together with [U.S.
government]{.mark} [officials]{.mark}, Secretary-General [Lee met
with]{.mark} representatives from our [diplomatic allies, reiterating
support]{.mark} and commitment [to]{.mark} [a]{.mark} free and [open
Indo-Pacific region]{.mark}**]{.underline}," the statement said.
Taiwan's foreign affairs ministry and the de facto U.S. embassy in
Taiwan declined to comment on Monday. Beijing regularly calls Taiwan the
most sensitive and important issue in ties with the United States, which
has no formal ties with Taiwan but is the island's main source of arms.
**[The United States has in recent months increased the frequency of
patrols through the strategic Taiwan Strait despite opposition from
China.]{.underline}** China has been ramping up military and diplomatic
pressure to assert its sovereignty over the island, conducting drills
near Taiwan and snatching its few remaining diplomatic allies. Earlier
in May, the U.S. House of Representatives backed legislation supporting
Taiwan as members of the U.S. Congress pushed for a sharper approach to
relations with Beijing. The Pentagon says Washington has sold Taipei
more than \$15 billion in arms since 2010..

#### Arm sales do not affect China-Taiwan relations, they just embolden Taiwanese nationalism.

//)2simmz

[After the normalization of U.S.-China relations, there was an
understandable expectation in China that the Taiwan issue was on its way
to being resolved]{.underline}. The formal cord between Taiwan and
Washington had been cut and the island faced further international
isolation. [**[Declining American arms sales]{.mark} pursuant to the
August 1982 communique [would increase Taiwan's military and political
vulnerability]{.mark}.** China's new economic policy of reform and
opening up would create an economic basis for unification]{.underline}.
Beijing's one country, two systems formula for unification seemed
generous, at least in its own eyes. [And the KMT regime was firmly in
power with leaders who were dedicated Chinese nationalists.]{.underline}
Some Americans had similar expectations. [Beijing soon experienced a
series of rude awakenings. [Washington]{.mark} enhanced its political,
economic, and even military support for Taiwan, and affirmed that all
its steps were within its definition of its one-China
policy.]{.underline} **[It [refused to sacrifice Taiwan for]{.mark} the
sake of [better U.S.-China relations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Taiwan's
democratization both empowered the electorate to set limits on
cross-Strait policy and denied any leader the power to impose on the
public a solution to the dispute with China, whether independence or
unification. [A stronger Taiwanese identity, a preference for the status
quo, and widespread opposition to "one country, two systems" all put a
mutually acceptable compromise apparently out of reach]{.underline}.
Even growing economic interdependence became a political liability:
[Tsai Ing-wen's electoral prospects were boosted by the Sunflower
Movement, which rejected a draft agreement on trade in services that the
Ma administration had struck with Beijing]{.underline}, and by growing
sentiment that economic dependence on China was increasing the risk of
political incorporation on the PRC's terms. Forty years after
normalization, several realities are evident. First of all, most
[**[Taiwan voters have proven to be]{.mark} clear-eyed [pragmatists
about the geopolitical reality in which they find themselves]{.mark}**.
China will always be 90 miles from Taiwan and will only gain economic
and military power in the future. Yet [they will remain committed
to]{.mark} their [Taiwan identity and]{.mark} to some version of the
status quo, which includes [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second,
although Taiwan's democratic system is not perfect, it possesses
significant guard-rails to prevent destabilizing initiatives by
demagogic politicians. Constitutional amendments, which would be
required to change the legal and political status quo in any fundamental
way, are very difficult. [**[No]{.mark} serious [politician has]{.mark}
[made the case as to why changing]{.mark} that [status quo would]{.mark}
be worth the risks and [yield a more beneficial situation]{.mark}.**
China's military power and its authoritarian political system are
deterrents to radical change on Taiwan.]{.underline} Finally, the United
States has made clear its preference for continuity and moderation.
Third, **[[U.S. arms sales are not a significant obstacle to
unification. The idea that]{.mark} continued U.S. [security support for
Taiwan leads Taiwan leaders to resist negotiations has been proven wrong
by the experience of the early Lee Teng-hui period]{.mark} and Ma
Ying-jeou's presidency.]{.underline}** Instead, [two other obstacles
impede the progress the PRC seeks. One is the public opposition to
unification on China's' terms]{.underline} ("one country, two systems").
The other is Taiwan's view that it is a sovereign entity for purposes of
unification, a view that is inconsistent with the fundamental premise of
"one country, two systems". Fourth, therefore, [if the PRC wishes to
promote its cause of unification without coercion or violence, it will
have to offer a new formula for resolving the fundamental cross-Strait
dispute that is more responsive to Taiwanese aspirations and concerns.
"One country, two systems" was formulated not long after the
normalization of U.S.-China relations and has remained a constant since
then.]{.underline} But in the interim Taiwan has changed in ways that
have transformed cross-Strait relations. Is China prepared to change as
well?

#### Turn---Taiwan's defense industry is key to reverse China Brain Drain, and the US withdrawing arm sales is antithetical to US interests.

secure China's central position in the world order]{.underline}. [**The
Taiwan Travel Act**, which [Trump signed into law in
March](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/press-release/taiwan-travel-act-becomes-law/),
supports closer official U.S.-Taiwan engagement at all
levels.]{.underline} Likewise, the 2019 National Defense Authorization
Act urges the [United States to participate in "appropriate Taiwanese
military exercises, such as the annual Han Kuang
exercise](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr5515/text)" and
encourages high-level defense and military exchanges. As [Washington
dials up pressure on Beijing, mainly to address unfair Chinese
investment practices and leeching of U.S. intellectual property, [it
should not view Taiwan simply as a lever in its diplomatic
toolkit]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, [[it should]{.mark} advance an
affirmative vision, [strengthen]{.mark}ing [Taiwan's ability to]{.mark}
[compete economically]{.mark} [and militarily]{.mark} for the long term
[and remain a bastion of democracy in the Chinese-speaking
world]{.mark}. **Taiwan could become collateral damage in an open-ended
and multifront trade war.**]{.underline}  Taiwan is already enduring
steel and aluminum tariffs, and subsequent rounds of a trade spat with
China could end up squeezing Taiwanese firms dependent on providing
spare parts for mainland-manufactured smartphones and computers. [A
deepening trade war would also exacerbate some other detrimental trends,
such as Beijing's pursuit of the Made in China 2025 initiative to
achieve greater indigenous innovation and semiconductor
sovereignty]{.underline}. Viewed from another vantage point, however,
the United States and Taiwan's growing technological competition with
Beijing amounts to a powerful convergence of interests. It underscores
an opportunity for the two countries to strengthen their innovation in
information and communication technology. [Taiwan's President Tsai
Ing-wen advocated for [shifting Taiwan's economy from an
efficiency-driven model to an innovation-driven
one](https://www.mofa.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n=8157691CA2AA32F8&sms=4F8ED5441E33EA7B&s=E14734C1FB32BB0B) in
her 2016 inaugural address.]{.underline} **[Helping Taiwan realize this

complexes in middle
America](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/CEO-in-the-news/In-Wisconsin-Foxconn-s-Terry-Gou-seeks-a-future-beyond-Apple)]{.underline}**.
[Genuine [innovation requires]{.mark} [continuing to strengthen ties
between Silicon Valley and Taiwan's]{.mark} small- and medium-sized
[enterprise ecosystem,]{.mark} as well as boosting venture investment
into Taiwanese startups.]{.underline} Military cooperation constitutes
another core pillar for U.S.-Taiwan relations. Taiwan has committed
to [spending more on
defense](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-usa/taiwan-to-boost-defense-spending-u-s-concerned-over-possible-military-imbalance-official-media-idUSKBN1CZ07H) and
is slated to increase its defense spending by at least 2 percent each
year until 2025. Since her inauguration, Tsai has sought to fortify
Taiwan's indigenous defense programs. [**[Supplying]{.mark} the
free-market economy with [dual-use technologies]{.mark} that [could help
build]{.mark} advanced platforms such as conventional [submarines
would]{.mark} thus [bolster Taiwan's economy]{.mark} [and
security]{.mark} at the same time**. And job creation in its defense
industry would help **counteract China's deliberate brain drain of young
Taiwanese engineers** and innovators frustrated with Taiwan's
decades-long wage stagnation.]{.underline} For the near-term, [the
United States needs to think critically about how it can work with
Taiwan to strengthen defense and deterrence, beyond the acquisition of
flashy hardware]{.underline}. Trump is willing to put together another
arms sale for Taiwan at a politically appropriate time, but legislators
in Washington and Taipei will expect the administration to outline
priorities that support a coherent and realistic strategy. [To
strengthen its deterrence, Taiwan needs to invest more of its defense
budget toward asymmetric defenses that complicate Chinese planning and
signal to Beijing that any use of force will be costly.]{.underline}
Trump enjoys high regard in Taiwan because of his willingness to show
support for the island. It helps to have a hawkish national security
advisor in John Bolton. But the vicissitudes of politics could create an
environment conducive to a crisis. Presidential elections are due to
take place in both the United States and Taiwan in 2020, and problems
could arise: from external meddling in democratic elections, to a sharp
political swing in policies, to second-term administrations that try
China's strategic patience. A confluence of events could push Beijing to
tighten its chokehold on Taiwan. All the more reason that the current
U.S. administration should advance defense and deterrence as core
priorities in the U.S.-Taiwan relationship and help Taiwan reposition
its economy for long-term growth.

#### Aff can't solve -- US law prohibits NASA from cooperating with China.

What\'s more, it doesn\'t sound like the attitudes of US lawmakers
toward the People\'s Republic of China are changing anytime soon.

A 2015 report from the University of California called \"[ China Dream,

Dream](http://origin.www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/China%20Dream%20Space%20Dream_Report.pdf)\"
concludes that: \"China\'s efforts to use its space program to transform
itself into a military, economic, and technological power may come at
the expense of U.S. leadership and has serious implications for U.S.
interests.\"

It will take a big policy shift to change that sentiment and foster
collaboration between NASA and the China National Space Administration
(CNSA).

[One of the biggest collaborative projects in which NASA is involved is
the [International Space Station
