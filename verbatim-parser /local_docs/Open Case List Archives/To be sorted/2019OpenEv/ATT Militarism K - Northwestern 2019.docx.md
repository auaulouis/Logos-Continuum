### Militarism K \-\-- 1NC

#### The 1AC's call to ratify the ATT is a [hypocritical]{.underline} approach that attempts to [control]{.underline} global arms trade and preserve ethical integrity while disobeying the norms they impose on other signatories

Anna **Stavrianakis 16**, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
the University of Sussex, "Legitimizing Liberal Militarism: Politics,
Law and War in the Arms Trade Treaty," 1/8/16, Third World Quarterly,
37:5, 840-865, DOI: 10.1080/01436597.2015.1113867

[Claims about the normative power of conventional arms transfer control
regimes have been sternly tested by empirical studies. [Studies]{.mark}
of patterns [of arms exports demonstrate how the **"self-declared
ethical turn" of major western arms suppliers**]{.mark} in the 1990s
**[has not acted as a bar on weapons exports]{.mark}**.]{.underline}34
The US and [[Western]{.underline}]{.mark} European [[states
"have]{.mark} generally [not exercised export controls]{.mark} so as [to
discriminate against human rights abusing]{.mark} or autocratic
[countries]{.mark} during the post-Cold War period.]{.underline}"35 [At
best]{.underline}, the effect of the EU Code of Conduct, which served as
one of the templates for the ATT, has been that "[EU members no longer
appear to reward poor human rights with arms transfers, even if they are
not punishing it either."]{.underline}36 [[And in specific cases such as
EU member states' arms transfers to Libya, **evidence
demonstrates**]{.mark} **comprehensive [violation of export control
principles]{.mark}** [even though exporting governments were aware of
the risks posed by transfers:]{.mark} licence denials \"constitute
exceptions in an overall export-friendly environment]{.underline}."37

[These empirical patterns raise the question of **how [liberal
states]{.mark} manage to [both transfer weapons to]{.mark} human rights
violating and [authoritarian regimes, and claim]{.mark} the mantle of
[responsibility by being publicly in favour of the
ATT]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The empirical [[studies]{.underline}]{.mark}
cited above [tend to [adopt a realist explanation in which
seemingly]{.mark} normatively [progressive regimes serve as rhetorical
cover]{.mark} for material or strategic interests,]{.underline}38 [yet
they do not go into detail as to how that process works. **Realist
explanations are inadequate** because they fail to take into account the
hard work that such rhetoric performs or the way that regimes function
often despite the good intention of some proponents]{.underline}.39 Law
and regulation are not merely superficial cover, a distraction from a
focus on the advancement of material interests: law "does matter; that
is both the problem and the promise."40 Thus [whilst constructivists are
right that rationalist assumptions of narrowly instrumental behaviour
are false,]{.underline}41 [they do not give an adequate explanation of
the significance of the morally oriented work that is going on in [the
ATT]{.mark}:]{.underline} the ways in [which [a seemingly progressive
initiative contains the seeds of its own complicity in broader systems
of preparation for war and violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet Price does
point to how, "**[if hypocrisy becomes too endemic then it may undercut
the power of the moral legitimacy more generally that is required for
hypocrisy's piggy-back effects]{.underline}**."42 So it may be that arms
transfers are so embedded in hypocrisy that normative shaming is less
effective. As Erickson argues, "the ATT faces a hard road ahead":
"[without the means to expose and punish noncompliance, \... \[ambitious
policies\] do little more than enhance states' reputations without
improving human rights and conflict conditions on the
ground]{.underline}."43 Yet "[Research explaining major suppliers'
support for 'responsible' arms export controls is
lacking]{.underline}."44 --[To start thinking about this gap between
commitment and compliance]{.underline}, and to explain major suppliers'
positions[, I advance the concept of liberal militarism]{.underline}.
This moves beyond arguments based on hypocrisy and instrumental or
functional pursuit of material interests, in order to explain key
effects of the treaty in ways other approaches cannot. [[The
normalization and legitimation of liberal ways of war and war
preparation via the ATT are an important component of contemporary
militarism.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Their [investment into militarism]{.underline} results in violence being used as a mechanism to solve conflicts\-\--this [sustains the patriarchy]{.underline} and encourages [endless military intervention]{.underline}

[[Militarism]{.mark} in various forms [dominates states all over the
world]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} its basic value of \"[power over the other\"
influences the population]{.mark} which begins [to accept]{.mark} the
suitability of **[violence as a method of resolving
conflicts]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Although war and the military are
considered to be \"men\'s work,\" [armed conflict and the [militarist
ideology]{.mark} have had a great impact [on]{.mark} [women]{.mark} all
over the world. A gender analysis of militarism is essential to both
feminists and peace activists who are working towards a world free of
all forms of violence, injustice and oppression.]{.underline} [Military
values [contribute to]{.mark} the [construction]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
narrow definitions of **[masculine and feminine
characteristics]{.mark}** and this should be addressed by feminists in
search of an alternative society without rigid gender roles. [Patriarchy
is one of the roots of militarism]{.mark}]{.underline}, so a gender
analysis is useful to peace activists, in order to challenge the basic
ideology of militarism, rather than just addressing its effects. An
examination of the effects of militarism on [women in both peace and war
time show that women do have a specific concern with militarism and war
and therefore a large stake in working for peace.]{.underline}

Militarism encompasses much more than just the armed forces of a state
and their activities. [It is an ideology of power affecting governments
with different political objectives and [its influence]{.mark}
[can]{.mark} [become]{.mark} part of [a social process which penetrates
**all**]{.mark} **areas of a [society]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One useful
definition of this complex idea comes from the World Council of
Churches, which defines militarism as the result of the process of
militarization in which \"military values, ideology and pattern of
behavior achieve a dominating influence on the political, social,
economic and external affairs of the state, and as a consequence the
structural, ideological and behavioural patterns of both the society and
the government are \'militarized.\'\" [[Militarism]{.mark}
[involves]{.mark} a [willingness]{.mark} on the part of states to
realize their policies through deliberate [and organized use of physical
force]{.mark}. It is open-ended and there is no theoretical limit on how
much force will be used**[; it is indiscriminate, continuous and
impenitent]{.mark}**. **[War is not a continuous state of
humanity]{.mark}**, nor is it something which creates itself or \"just
happens[.\" It is a direct result of militarism, and should be seen in
that light.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Militarism as a process has both material and ideological
manifestations. These vary in different cultures and at different times,
but there are some common elements. [The material forms of
[militarism]{.mark} which are evident around the world [include wars and
direct **military interventions**]{.mark}**, [destabilization]{.mark}**
of other countries [through]{.mark} [proxy]{.mark} armies,
foreign-sponsored [coups]{.mark}, foreign and **[colonial occupation,
military rule and abuse of human rights]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Its
institutional manifestations include the armed forces and government
budgets which devote a disproportionate amount of money to the military.
Militarization is the \"gradual encroachment of the military institution
into the civilian arena,\" including, for example, industrial plants
becoming dependent on military contracts or the state relying on the
military to solve its unemployment problems.

#### Vote Negative to [challenge]{.underline} the [legitimacy of western imperialism]{.underline} and [war making]{.underline}\-\--the ATT [epitomizes the compatibility between the military and human rights]{.underline}, making endless warfighting inevitable

Anna **Stavrianakis 16**, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
the University of Sussex, "Legitimizing Liberal Militarism: Politics,
Law and War in the Arms Trade Treaty," 1/8/16, Third World Quarterly,
37:5, 840-865, DOI: 10.1080/01436597.2015.1113867

[The ATT is]{.underline} very much a product of its time: [the fusing of
human rights and IHL by a North-South coalition of state and non-state
actors in pursuit of improved human security]{.underline}. [[This
project occurs in the context of an international system marked by
western military predominance:]{.underline}]{.mark} the post-9/11 period
is [the "longest period of continuous warfare in American
history",]{.underline} according to Michael Mann, in which we see ["[a
highly militaristic power in a peaceful international system," **an
expansive imperial appetite**]{.mark}]{.underline} "accompanying it of
course with fine-sounding rhetoric about improving the world."144 This
article has sought to examine the significance of the liberal claim to
improving the world via the claim to the mantle of legitimacy,
responsibility and morality in arms trade regulation. [**[The
mobilisation of risk assessment in ways that mute criticism of ongoing
arms supply despite human rights violations]{.mark}**, as seen in the
Egypt case, [and the depoliticisation of war-preparation that includes
potential violations of IHL]{.mark}, as seen in the case of
intra-western transfers and the prosecution of liberal wars, **[are key
ways in which liberal forms of militarism are
legitimated]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Understanding regulatory regimes as
performing such a function helps us explore the role they play in what
Anna Leander calls "militarizing by distraction" (here, distracting away
from the harm and violence caused by legitimate as well as illegitimate
transfers) and "militarizing by distinction" (the distinction between
legitimate interests and the illicit market, between responsible actors
and irresponsible ones).145

[Proponent NGOs are critical of liberal state practices that violate
human rights, but their arguments are usually based on the assumption
that their policies and practices are fundamentally sound, and that
liberal states' own use of force and transfers between them are not
relevant to the arms transfer control agenda. Liberal states themselves
disavow any impact that the ATT will have on their regulatory regimes,
precisely by reference to their existing systems. So liberal states'
regulatory regimes and justifications cannot be dismissed as purely
strategic or rhetorical -- **[they have a strong effect, even if that
effect is not towards more restrictive arms transfer
practices]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Further, "if hi-tech violence is
shielded from prosecution, this may sap the moral force of the law and
allow low-end offenders to paint themselves as victims of politicized
proceedings."146 This is precisely what happened in the ATT
negotiations,147 and is a reason for thinking in terms of legitimation.
**[[With attempts at legitimation comes resistance and contestation, as
seen in the justifications from non-liberal states along the
way.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[Yet the very conditions of the ATT's success are the basis of its
political effects. Part of the success of post-Cold War arms transfer
control has been the way it has coalesced with mainstream security
discourse.148 Control Arms and other proponent NGOs **want a universal
system in which human rights are not politicised**]{.underline}: whilst
they recognise that states will engage in politicking, [they hold to the
idea of a fundamentally apolitical core of the protection of human
rights and IHL. For them, the ATT is an attempt to engage in technical,
non-political discussions with non-liberal states about issues such as
the diversion of weapons, in order to raise the bar of control standards
around the world]{.underline}.149 One of the ironies of the ATT process
is that consensus that the treaty should only deal with the "illicit"
and unregulated trade was fundamental to the degree of traction it
eventually garnered; [yet [the productive slippage between the concepts
of "illicit" and "irresponsible" transfers **means the ATT cannot
adequately be understood as an apolitical**, human security oriented
agenda with which some states played politics. **The very formulation is
itself deeply political.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Sounding a sceptical note about the ambiguities of regulation and the
way it can create both accountability and militarization poses "an
intractable dilemma; having to side either against regulation or in
favour of militarism is singularly unattractive."150 It is also still
quite a marginal activity: even Martin Shaw, who has done so much to
analyse risk-transfer militarism, ends on an optimistic note that this
analysis of the ATT cannot share. He argues that ["the door has been
fundamentally opened to new kinds of delegitimation of war:"
risk-transfer war is "vulnerable to new criticisms that will, sooner or
later, challenge even its newly refined justifications]{.underline}."151
And the development of legal frameworks combined with civil society
monitoring "means that military events are likely to be legally
monitored in new ways. Thus excesses (of course, a normal product of
war) are increasingly, if still very variably, capable of being legally
actioned."152 Similarly, Smith argues that human rights could help
"develop alternatives to war itself" and can bring "long-term and
cumulative impacts of war into focus in a way that IHL cannot",
including by "raising basic questions about the militarization of
societies and economies."153

[The analysis of the ATT advanced here suggests instead, however, that
it [is precisely the]{.mark} turn to law, the supposed [compatibility
between military]{.mark} preponderance [and human rights]{.mark}
protection, [and the failure to move beyond]{.mark} direct use of
[weapons]{.mark}, that **[helps legitimise]{.mark} (particular forms of)
[war]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Critical legal studies scholars
advocate "a form of law-politics to develop humanitarian principles into
a concrete, normative agenda:"154 and yet this is exactly what
humanitarian disarmers have been trying to do with the ATT and previous
arms transfer control regimes. It is important to recognize "that some
degree of complicity in previous social structures is inherent in social
change."155 Price argues that scholars should not underplay the morally
progressive significance of "[practices that at once contain elements of
progressive change \... yet at the same time are predicated on or
produce the conditions of possibility for other forms of exclusion,
hierarchy, inequality, repression or violence]{.underline}."156 However,
[the widespread emphasis on the progressive, if imperfect character of
the ATT in scholarship and policy, has failed to interrogate the
justificatory claims around moral responsibility that so pervaded its
negotiation]{.underline}. These claims contribute to obscuring a
significant scale of human rights violations and the wider systems of
war preparation that arms transfers are a part of. Further, such claims
are part of what sceptical southern states are responding to and
resisting, thus making wider normative change more difficult. [The ATT
negotiation process shored up liberal states' actions whilst invoking
their benevolence and assuming them to be distinct from illicit or
irresponsible actors. The supposed effectiveness of normative change is
muted by the existence of regimes that claim already to exceed the
standards of the ATT. **[This may not be the ideological glorification
of war that we tend to equate with the concept of militarism, but the
ATT signals the contemporary mobilisation of legitimacy for liberal
war-making and war- preparation nonetheless.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Hegemony Link\-\--ATT\-\--2NC

#### 1AC is a shortsighted and a faux attempt to resolve conflict through arms control which inevitably justifies further U.S. militarization for what is perceived as "the greater good"

Anna **[Stavrianakis 16]{.underline}**, Senior Lecturer in International
Relations at the University of Sussex, "Legitimizing Liberal Militarism:
Politics, Law and War in the Arms Trade Treaty," 1/8/16, Third World
Quarterly, 37:5, 840-865, DOI: 10.1080/01436597.2015.1113867

[The concept of [militarism]{.mark}, understood as the social and
international relations of the preparation for, and conduct of,
organized political violence]{.underline},45 [[allows us to
examine]{.mark} the historical, [socio-economic and political
sources]{.mark} and character [of military power]{.mark}]{.underline}.46
Understood this way, the concept goes beyond a definition of militarism
as ideology, and militarisation as the material process through which
militarism comes about[. [Militarism includes an ideological
component]{.underline}]{.mark} [but is not restricted to it, [because
**war and armed violence can be justified and facilitated even if not
necessarily glorified**]{.mark}; and because social forces beyond
ideology are required to produce it. **Arms transfers and [arms transfer
control may]{.mark} thus [contribute to militarisation]{.mark}** (an
increase in the intensity of military power in society, whether domestic
or international), demilitarisation (a decrease), or a change in the
character of militarism]{.underline}. The concept allows for the
analysis of the different forms across space and time taken by war and
preparation for it.47 And [whilst the number of deaths caused by the
arms trade is clearly an important yardstick, a [militarism]{.mark}
frame goes beyond numbers. Rather, it [captures the influence of
military relations on social relations]{.mark} in general[, and the ways
that war and armed violence are prepared for. This **requires broadening
the empirical focus beyond conflict in Africa and organized crime in
Latin America**]{.mark}**, which have been the main focus for arms
transfer control.**]{.underline}

[Scholars are increasingly challenging the long- and widely cherished
belief that liberalism and militarism are antithetical]{.underline}.48
[Key features of the specificity of liberal militarism include the
capital- and technology-intensive character of the preparation for and
conduct of war; a strong commitment to military production across war
and peacetime and self-understanding as a primarily "economic,
industrial and commercial power]{.underline};" the distanced form of
attacks on Southern populations and simultaneous containment of social
conflict at home and policing empire abroad, often featuring supposedly
"small" massacres; a universalist ideology and conception of world
order; [low levels of military participation by society; and a
state-capital relation that is formally separate but organically
related.]{.underline}49 [**[Justifications based on values and morals
promoting human rights]{.mark} and humanitarian values [are central to
legitimating]{.mark} these [features of liberal militarism]{.mark}**,
and are in contrast to the justifications based on sovereignty of other
major, non-liberal suppliers and recipients such as Russia, China and
India.]{.underline} In the case of the ATT, language and regulatory
bureaucratic practices of risk assessment are embedded in western,
liberal regimes that on paper already exceed the standards set out in
the ATT.

More generally, the turn to law has been central to the development of
liberal militarism. [[The laws of war serve a legitimizing effect for
western ways of war,]{.mark} pre- empting criticism through reassurance,
shielding acts and practices from criticism, and giving rhetorical
protection from challenge, which serves to naturalise and normalise the
prevailing distribution of power]{.underline}. 50 And the combination of
human rights and IHL has served to criminalize low-tech violence and
legitimate high-tech forms of war.51 [The turn to law is "productive of
the social and political context that makes possible certain forms of
war and certain relations of hierarchy," as the "perceived compliance
with the law itself is partly productive of the global order in which
contemporary war occurs.]{.underline}"52 This allows liberal states to
pitch their practice in terms of responsibility, morality and
legitimacy. Overall, then, [whilst it is inappropriate to claim that
legal regimes are mere instruments of the powerful, it is also too
strong to say that [humanitarian security regimes such as the ATT
operate "in opposition to the aspirations of the most powerful
states."53 What is at stake,]{.mark} rather[, is the legitimation of
specific forms of war fighting and war preparation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The ATT legitimizes liberal forms of war-fighting to maintain US military hegemony

Anna **Stavrianakis 16**, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
the University of Sussex, "Legitimizing Liberal Militarism: Politics,
Law and War in the Arms Trade Treaty," 1/8/16, Third World Quarterly,
37:5, 840-865, DOI: 10.1080/01436597.2015.1113867

Post-Cold War efforts to knit together human rights and international
humanitarian law in pursuit of tougher arms transfer control reached
their apogee in the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). In contrast to dominant
accounts based on human security norms, I argue that **[[a key effect of
the ATT is to legitimise liberal forms of
militarism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [During negotiations, [the US and UK
governments justified their arms export practices in terms of morality,
responsibility and legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}. And more broadly
[[their arms transfer practices are explained]{.mark} away [by]{.mark}
reference to [national regulatory regimes that exceed the standards set
out in the ATT]{.mark}]{.underline}. Arms transfers to Egypt and
intra-western transfers illustrate the way [[these
justifications]{.mark} and regimes serve to [shield US-UK weapons
transfers]{.mark} and use from scrutiny and accountability. Rather than
signalling the victory of human security, [the ATT is]{.mark} better
understood as [facilitating]{.mark} the mobilisation of [legitimacy for
contemporary **liberal forms of war-fighting and
war-preparation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The US's primary motive to support the treaty is to further its own interests and influence -- not the safety of global arms trade

Anna **Stavrianakis 16**, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at
the University of Sussex, "Legitimizing Liberal Militarism: Politics,
Law and War in the Arms Trade Treaty," 1/8/16, Third World Quarterly,
37:5, 840-865, DOI: 10.1080/01436597.2015.1113867

[The UK government was the first major exporter to express public
support for the ATT]{.underline}, in March 2005, [becoming a key
champion of the treaty, bringing "political force and
credibility]{.underline}" 54 to the campaign. [UK industry came on board
a year later as a way to level the playing field]{.underline} and
UK-based NGOs were central to the Control Arms campaign, which was
funded and supported to a considerable extent by the UK government.[55
In contrast[, the USA]{.mark} [was the only]{.mark} [state to vote
against]{.mark} [the]{.mark} July 2006 and January 2009 UN
Resolutions.56 It was not until October 2009 (under the Obama
administration) that the US voted in favour of the negotiating process
under [Resolution]{.mark} 64/48. [For]{.mark} British [treaty]{.mark}
[participants, getting the USA on board]{.mark} [was crucial]{.mark}57
[and]{.mark} [involved]{.mark} [dialogue]{.mark} with the US **[to get
it to a position]{.mark}** [where it could support the treaty]{.mark}.58
[The]{.mark} [US]{.mark} government **[was never a leader]{.mark}** in
the negotiations but over time shifted to "refrain from serving as an
impediment to progress."]{.underline}59 [[Once]{.mark} this
[shift]{.mark} [happened]{.mark}, [the US]{.mark} position [was
pitched]{.mark} [in]{.mark} terms of [how the ATT]{.mark} **[allows the
US to promote]{.mark}** its [standards]{.mark} [universally]{.mark},
[using]{.mark} [language of responsibility]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
legitimate [trade]{.mark}]{.underline}.60 And the [US delegation
insisted on key procedural conditions such as consensus as the mechanism
for decision-making, 61 as a means to control the agenda.]{.underline}
In this light, the roots of the ATT -- in addition to the human security
agenda -- include the US' International Arms Sales Code of Conduct Act
of 1999, which required the President to begin negotiations towards an
international code of conduct for arms sales62; and the related 2000
US-EU Declaration in Responsibility in Arms Exports, in which they
publicly espoused the importance of "responsibility, transparency and
restraint."63 [[These]{.mark} other [politico]{.mark}-[economic]{.mark}
[sources]{.mark} of impetus [for]{.mark} [multilateral]{.mark}
[action]{.mark} [promote]{.mark} the shared goal of [bringing China and
other emerging suppliers into]{.mark} a common [regulatory
regime]{.mark}, to prevent undercutting.64]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} [US]{.mark} government's claims to universalism,
responsibility and morality, meanwhile**, [were]{.mark} more
unilateralist and [interest-based]{.mark}** in character. Its delegation
was much more explicit about bringing the rest of world up to its
"responsible" standards for "legitimate" transfers,73 with its system
understood as "the 'gold standard' of export controls]{.underline}."74
The ATT will serve as a "trifecta" of peace, security and human rights
for the USA.75 [[US]{.mark} arms transfers **are carried out [for
"one]{.mark} main [reason]{.mark}**: [to]{.mark} [further]{.mark}
[**US** national security **interests**]{.mark}"]{.underline} -- [they
are "an unequivocal signal [to those who seek to]{.mark} [counter US
interests]{.mark} or undermine international norms]{.underline}."76 This
[[alignment of US interests with international norms serves to elide the
empirical]{.mark} [patterns]{.mark}]{.underline} identified earlier and
there is a clear political move at stake, which is much more acceptable
in US political speech than British: "the regulatory elegance of export
control systems aside, it is the arms transfer policies of governments
that matter most." 77

#### The aff is a control on humanitarianism leads to WMD proliferation\-\-- terrorist securitization and attempts to control arms under the ATT is a reason normalized threats will spiral into extinction

**Cooper and Mutimer 11**, Dr. Neil J. Cooper: head of Peace Studies and
International Development at the University of Bradford in the U.K., the
inaugural director of the School of Peace and Conflict Studies at Kent
State. David Mutimer: professor and Chair of Department for Political
Science at York University.), 05-24-2011, \"Arms Control for the 21st
Century: Controlling the Means of Violence\", Contemporary Security
Policy, https://doi.org/10.1080/13523260.2011.556820

We have thus moved from an era where arms control was principally about
ensuring societies remained at risk of extermination to one where it is
principally about exterminating risk all together -- at least for the
major powers. In many respects then, it is now [the practitioners of the
[contemporary WMD non-proliferation agenda]{.mark} [who]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} [become]{.mark} the new unilateral [disarmers]{.mark}
(albeit of the forcible kind) and the new idealists in search of the
kind of absolute security]{.underline} (albeit for themselves) that Bull
dismissed in 1961.20 Ironically however, this search for absolute
security appears to be giving rise to ever more arms control challenges
as illustrated by the way in which prophylactic interventions to prevent
the next 9/11 have given rise to threats of improvised explosive devices
and the copycat use of unmanned aerial vehicles.21 It **[is also the
[search for]{.mark} the absolute security of the boiling frog, where
[low risk, high impact, events]{.mark} such as 9/11 prompt intense
efforts to escape from repetition, [but]{.mark} the gradual ratcheting
up of [normalized threats such as global warming are]{.mark} treated
within a policy paradigm [characterized]{.mark} by exceptionally [high
levels of tolerance]{.mark} for the associated risks, mutual
vulnerabilities and insecurities they produce -- including, in the case
of global warming, the possibility of global ecocide.]{.underline}**
Needless to say, these aspects of [[contemporary arms control]{.mark}
practice [do not suggest]{.mark} a propitious environment for [arms
control]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of course there are a number of positive
developments that we have neglected so far. These include Obama's
commitment to nuclear disarmament and a turn to what is increasingly
being labelled humanitarian arms control -- the attempt to restrict
pariah weapons deemed inhumane (landmines, cluster munitions) or to
prevent the spread of small arms deemed to fuel internal conflicts. [In
some respects, current [attempts to develop]{.mark} a global Arms Trade
Treaty ([**ATT**) might also be described as a form of **humanitarian
arms control.** ]{.mark}On all counts we remain somewhat sceptical about
the radical nature of these developments. In the case of the first, we
note Obama's qualification in his Prague speech that nuclear disarmament
may not be achieved 'in my lifetime' and also note that American
proposals for disarmament **[can be better interpreted as an attempt to
formalize the military advantage]{.mark}** that comes from its huge
conventional defence budget in a context [where there is]{.mark} acute
[concern about the potential for WMD proliferation to finally go
critical]{.mark}.22 We are also sceptical about the roots and nature of
the pariah weapons agenda as well as the scope for further action on
this agenda. Similarly, [action on small arms and light weapons]{.mark}
has focussed predominantly on the illicit trade obscuring both the role
of the legal trade in small arms and light weapons (SALW) and the role
[played]{.mark} by major conventional [weapons]{.mark} in civil
conflicts]{.underline}. Moreover, whilst [**a putative Arms Trade Treaty
(ATT**) has the potential to act as a corrective to the latter, we are
also acutely aware of the limited time allowed for negotiation,
**[the]{.mark} current emphasis on consensus, and [American linkage of
the treaty with the fight against terrorism]{.mark} and rogue states all
of which seem likely to [produce]{.mark} either a [weak
agreement]{.mark} [or]{.mark} yet [another]{.mark} [instrument in the
war]{.mark} on terror rather than a properly functioning system of
global arms trade regulation**]{.underline}.23

### Interventionism Link\-\--ATT\-\--2NC

#### The ATT is a risk assessment paradigm that legitimizes US military intervention while simultaneously allowing the U.S. to decide which humans are valid, and whether or not their rights are worth intervening for

A focus on two specific cases -- [[arms transfers to Egypt during the
Arab Spring]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [intra-western transfers]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} use in [liberal]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} of choice --
[illustrates]{.mark} the argument in more detail.]{.underline}
Discourses of risk have been embedded into arms trade regulation, yet
[the [continuities]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [US]{.mark}-UK [practice]{.mark}
suggest [that]{.mark} they serve a primarily legitimating purpose. The
risk assessment process **[allows liberal states to continue preparing
for war and supporting war-making institutions, capitalist development,
and restricted forms of politics]{.mark}** overseas [and]{.mark}
[simultaneously]{.mark} [claim]{.mark} the mantle of [morality]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [responsibility]{.mark}.]{.underline} Krause identifies a
logic of governmentality in arms control, in which forms of [regulation
burrow deep into the domestic politics of states]{.underline}.
Accompanying this has been a "normative evolution" around "who could
legitimately use what kinds of violence against which people or groups
and under what circumstances." 80 [Whilst there are indeed increasingly
complex and bureaucratised processes of risk management around arms
transfer regulation, [this]{.mark} supposed **[normative]{.mark}
evolution [has]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [restrained]{.mark}
[historically]{.mark} [long]{.mark}-standing [patterns of liberal use of
violence]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} [non-liberal societies and support
for violence in the non-European world]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the
burgeoning literature on risk "has shifted security away from the
register of war and violence,"81 [the [incorporation]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
risk into [arms]{.mark} [trade]{.mark} [regulation]{.mark} is
[better]{.mark} understood in terms of the maintenance of the legitimacy
of war in the west]{.underline}.82 This is not to say that modes of
control have not been changing in recent decades: the shift to democracy
promotion since the 1980s may generate "a more resilient form of social
control than authoritarian and dictatorial rule,"83 and
[[capitalism]{.mark} has long featured combinations of consensual
[and]{.mark} [coercive]{.mark} modes of [rule]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [brutal]{.mark} [suppression]{.mark} of demonstrations and protests
[in]{.mark} [Middle]{.mark} [Eastern]{.mark} [and]{.mark} North
[African]{.mark} [states]{.mark} from late 2010, often using
foreign-supplied military and police equipment, [was]{.mark} used
[by]{.mark} campaigners as an [example]{.mark} of the need [for an
ATT]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}84 Seeking to provide a practical
methodology for the implementation of human rights protection as part of
the treaty, Amnesty International asks "what went wrong?" with arms
supplies to the region.85 Amnesty's answer, pitched in terms of risk
assessment and mitigation, provides an example of the (by political
necessity) thoroughly depoliticised character of debate about arms
transfers and control, and of the shared fiction between state and
non-state actors around arms transfer control. Amnesty proposes a
methodology for risk assessment based on the seriousness of violations
(measured by gravity and pervasiveness) and level of risk. For the risk
of misuse of weapons to be "substantial", it must be "beyond suspicion,
but need not be as high as 'highly probable'" -- it needs to be
"reasonably foreseen," based on credible evidence of current and past
record.86 If the risk is deemed substantial, arms export licences should
be refused or revoked "until the risk of further violations using such
arms has been curtailed through remedial action."87 [In the case of
Egypt, the pattern of serious violations was such that "any meaningful
risk assessment process would have informed states that there was a
substantial risk of arms being misused by the security
forces]{.underline}."88 As a result, [Amnesty called for a suspension of
arms transfers and a review of policy by suppliers,89 and for an ATT
that has "international human rights and humanitarian law at the core of
its normative framework."]{.underline}90

[[Given]{.mark} that [the ATT is intended to protect the
"legitimate]{.mark}" arms [trade]{.mark}, **[there]{.mark} [has to be a
way for states to be able to resume transfers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As
such, criticisms of suppliers' practices are pitched in terms of the
need for more rigorous implementation and a halt to exports until
improvements are seen[. NGOs campaigning for the ATT such as Amnesty
International take "no position" on weaponry not of "direct use" in
human rights violations.]{.underline}91 This approach stems from an
opposition to the politicization of arms transfer criteria, which should
be "implemented objectively and fairly."92 [[Yet]{.mark} the assumption
that objective [judgments can be made, outside of
interpretation,]{.mark} depoliticises what is inherently and unavoidably
political. [And]{.mark} the no-position position [effectively
marginalises the wider role of arms]{.mark} transfers [in]{.mark}
[buttressing]{.mark} [authoritarian]{.mark} social [relations]{.mark}
[beyond]{.mark} their direct use in human [rights]{.mark}
[abuses]{.mark}]{.underline}. Amnesty concludes that 14 "It is difficult
to understand" how arms suppliers examined risk, "particularly in the
context of the existing pattern of internal repression."93 But the case
for an alternative explanation is contained within Amnesty's own
evidence base: entrenched patterns, and the way that "political and
economic interests have often been prioritized in the decision-making
process over human rights considerations."94 [Yet the focus on
case-bycase **[risk]{.mark} [assessment]{.mark} [assumes]{.mark} that
human rights [violations]{.mark} are aberrations that [can be ironed
out,]{.mark}** [rather]{.mark} [than]{.mark} an organic component of
[support]{.mark} [for]{.mark} elites and authoritarian [social
relations]{.mark} that, whilst undergoing transformation in the
contemporary moment, still involve the buttressing of coercive
institutions.]{.underline}

In the eventual treaty text, the language of "substantial" risk as
called for by NGOs was downgraded to that of "overriding" risk, at the
US' insistence95 and in line with the US' national approach to arms
export licensing.96 And [the [risk]{.mark} [of]{.mark} serious human
rights [violations]{.mark} and other ills can be balanced against
consideration of whether the export "would contribute to or undermine
peace and security"97 -- allowing states to conduct a risk assessment
and approve the export anyway]{.underline}. The US has a system of
either weakly "taking into account" human rights or blanket banning,
which often becomes "a punitive sanctions measure," according to
Amnesty.98 The transfer process is "subject to large executive
discretion" through the use of waivers by the President or Secretary of
State for Defense.99 While Amnesty wants to encourage a shift in US
policy to a "preventive approach" in which licences are denied "[if
there is a risk the arms are likely to be used to commit human rights
violations,"100 the US government claims to already operate a
case-by-case approach in which arms transfers are always "thoroughly
reviewed" by the State Department Political-Military Bureau "to
[ensure]{.mark} [any]{.mark} arms [sale]{.mark} is in line [with
U.S.]{.mark} foreign [policy]{.mark} so that it [advances]{.mark} both
[our interests]{.mark} [and]{.mark} our
[values]{.mark}.]{.underline}"101 So controversial decisions are not a
mistake -- they are the policy. And one of the US' negotiating redlines
was that there was to be no international body to enforce the ATT, and
that exports remain a national decision.102 W[hilst [the]{.mark}
[ATT]{.mark} directs state parties to undertake a risk assessment, it
[cannot]{.mark} [direct]{.mark} them what [decision]{.mark} to make as a
result. The US government response to the repression of protest in Egypt
combined denial of the use of US-supplied weaponry103, a pledge to make
"adjustments" where necessary104, a review that made little change to
transfers to Egypt105, and the use of a 15 national security waiver to
facilitate the release of US \$1.3bn of military aid.]{.underline}106 It
[was only when the Egyptian military ousted President Morsi in July 2013
that the US government was compelled to suspend its aid
programme]{.underline} (due to requirements of the Foreign Assistance
Act) [but this was only partial and temporary.]{.underline}107 [The
[US]{.mark} [response]{.mark} [suggests]{.mark} that the calculus of
risk is only [weakly]{.mark} [embedded]{.mark} in the
[governance]{.mark} of its arms transfers and military aid --
[and]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} approach [predominated]{.mark} in the
[wording of the]{.mark} final [ATT]{.mark} text.]{.underline}

### Responsibility to Protect\-\--ATT\-\--2NC

#### The arms trade treaty reflects the idea of responsibility to protect -- placing a moral responsibility to take action in vulnerable countries

[[The influence of R2P can be seen in the language used in the text of
the Arms Trade Treaty.]{.mark} This is particularly clear in the
preamble, principles and purpose, which are important as they assist in
interpretation of the treaty obligations as a whole]{.underline}.41
[[The preamble]{.mark} explicitly [acknowledges 'that civilians,
particularly women and children, account for the vast majority of those
adversely affected by armed conflict and armed
violence]{.mark}']{.underline}.42 This places emphasis on the protection
of the most vulnerable part of the civilian population as part of the
context of the treaty. In highlighting the particular vulnerability of
civilians in connection with the trade in conventional arms, the
preamble reinforces the broader civilian protection agenda and
illustrates the significance of the secondary duty under R2P to 'help to
protect populations' from atrocity crimes.

In addition[, part of the preamble sets forth a set of principles, which
includes '\[r\]especting and ensuring respect for international
humanitarian law in accordance with, inter alia, the Geneva Conventions
of 1949, and respecting and ensuring respect for human rights in
accordance with, inter alia, the Charter of the United Nations and the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights'.]{.underline}43 The reference to
respect for international humanitarian law and international human
rights is a welcome inclusion in a treaty concerning the trade in
conventional arms. It brings to the fore one of the initial incentives
for developing the Arms Trade Treaty in the first place -- to reduce
human suffering by establishing the highest possible common
international standards for regulating or improving the regulation of
the international trade in conventional arms.44 [This demonstrates the
subtle shift in emphasis in international law generally towards the
protection of the most vulnerable, which stems from the broader civilian
protection agenda and is integrated in the secondary duty to 'help to
protect populations' from atrocity crimes under R2P.]{.underline}

[[The influence of R2P can also be identified in another of the Treaty's
principles, expressed as the 'responsibility of all States,]{.mark} in
accordance with their respective international obligations, to
effectively regulate the international trade in conventional arms, and
to prevent their diversion, as well as the primary responsibility of all
States in establishing and implementing their respective national
control systems]{.underline}'.45 This two-tier structure of
responsibility for regulation of the international trade in conventional
arms echoes R2P, with the primary responsibility falling on the
individual State and the secondary responsibility falling on the
international community (all States). [It is significant that the
language of R2P and the two-tier level of responsibility has been
specifically incorporated into an international treaty, particularly a
treaty concerning the trade in conventional arms.]{.underline} **[[This
reveals the subtle impact of R2P on treaty making, with the language of
R2P becoming mainstream and integrated into the treaty
text.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

While the preamble also acknowledges considerations such as non-
intervention and respect for the legitimate interests of States to
acquire, produce, export, import, and transfer conventional arms,46
these are outside the scope of this paper and will not be discussed in
any detail. It is worth noting, however, that they will also aid in
interpretation of the Arms Trade Treaty and demonstrate the important
balance in the Arms Trade Treaty between traditional State freedoms to
acquire arms and the new idea, flowing from R2P, that there are
international obligations to 'help to protect populations' that take
precedence when atrocity crimes are being committed.

The influence of R2P is also demonstrated in the express object and
purpose of the Arms Trade Treaty. Article 1 provides:

The object of this Treaty is to:

-- Establish the highest possible common international standards for

regulating or improving the regulation of the international trade in

conventional arms;

-- Prevent and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and pre-

vent their diversion; for the purpose of:

-- Contributing to international and regional peace, security and

stability;

-- Reducing human suffering;

-- Promoting cooperation, transparency and responsible action by

States Parties in the international trade in conventional arms, thereby
building confidence among States Parties.47

[[The need for the highest possible common standards, and the emphasis
on reducing human suffering and responsible action, reveal the influence
of the secondary duty under R2P in the choice of language used in the
treaty text. This also highlights the **shift in emphasis in
international law more generally towards increased protection of the
most vulnerable**]{.underline}]{.mark}.48

Consistent with the rules regarding treaty interpretation, the preamble,
principles and purpose can be used to aid in interpretation of the Arms
Trade Treaty.49 This part has argued that **[[it is significant that the
language and structure of responsibility of R2P has been incorporated
into the treaty's preamble]{.mark},]{.underline}** principles and
express purpose, as **[[the influence of R2P will therefore impact the
interpretation of the treaty obligations as a
whole.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Scope

[The influence of R2P can also be seen in the scope of the Arms Trade
Treaty]{.underline}, which is broad, although not comprehensive.50
States are encouraged to apply the provisions of the Arms Trade Treaty
to the broadest range of conventional arms;51 it sets a floor rather
than a ceiling. Indeed, the preamble expressly states that 'nothing in
this Treaty prevents States from maintaining and adopting additional
effective measures to further the object and purpose of this Treaty'.52
This is consistent with [the secondary duty under R2P to 'use
appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means' to 'help
to protect populations' from atrocity crimes.]{.underline} While [the
Arms Trade Treaty is one of those means]{.underline}, States Parties are
expressly permitted to do more by adopting additional measures to
further the object and purpose of the treaty, in order to better protect
the most vulnerable from atrocity crimes.

Article 2 establishes the categories of conventional arms that are
covered by the Treaty. It states that the Arms Trade Treaty applies to:

\(a\) Battle tanks;

\(b\) Armoured combat vehicles;

\(c\) Large-calibre artillery systems;

\(d\) Combat aircraft;

\(e\) Attack helicopters;

\(f\) Warships;

\(g\) Missiles and missile launchers; and

\(h\) Small arms and light weapons.53

**[[The inclusion of small arms and light weapons within the scope of
the Arms Trade Treaty is of particular significance for
R2P]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the protection of populations from
atrocity crimes. Of all conventional arms, small arms and light weapons
in particular, the weapon of choice in an estimated 90 per cent of
contemporary armed conflicts,54 pose a grave threat to the well-being
and lives of civilians due to their wide availability and use in
non-international armed conflicts.55 In 2000, then un Secretary-General
Kofi Annan recognised that 'in terms of the carnage they cause, small
arms, indeed, could well be described as "weapons of mass
destruction"'.56 Regulation of small arms and light weapons within the
Arms Trade Treaty demonstrates the significance of the secondary duty to
'help to protect populations' from atrocity crimes under R2P and is
indicative of the trend in international law toward greater protection
of the most vulnerable. While the Arms Trade Treaty does not cover all
weapons that can be used during armed conflict,57 [it will make it more
difficult for States Parties to transfer conventional arms, including
small arms and light weapons, to recipients that violate international
humanitarian law and international human rights law, and will restrict
the flow of conventional arms which might otherwise exacerbate or
prolong armed conflict, and facilitate the commission of atrocity
crimes.]{.underline}

Article 2 also establishes the activities of international trade which
are covered by the Arms Trade Treaty. These include 'export, import,
transit, trans- shipment and brokering', combined under the umbrella
term 'transfer' in the rest of the Treaty, of any of the conventional
arms listed in Article 2.58 While some States have reportedly expressed
an intention to exclude gifts from the notion of 'transfer',59 this
narrow reading of 'transfer' would appear to be contrary to the context,
and object and purpose of the Arms Trade Treaty,60 and the secondary
duty under R2P. The ordinary meaning of 'transfer' is broad,
incorporating commercial transactions, leases, gifts, loans, and aid.61
The broader interpretation to 'transfer' taken by the majority of
States, which includes non- commercial activities such as gifts and
loans, appears to be more consistent with the Treaty's key principles of
respecting and ensuring respect for inter- national humanitarian law and
international human rights enunciated in the preamble, and with the
secondary duty under R2P. Such an approach is also consistent with the
interpretation of 'transfer' in other arms control treaties, such as the
Anti-Personnel Landmine Convention, which has been interpreted to
include import, export, gift and sale,62 and the emerging trend in
international law generally toward increased protection for civilians
during armed conflict.63 The Arms Trade Treaty applies to a broad range
of activities under the term 'transfer', covering the majority of the
trade in conventional arms and increasing the capacity of States Parties
to 'help to protect populations' from atrocity crimes.

The influence of [[R2P is also demonstrated in the obligation on States
Parties to 'establish and maintain a national control system to regulate
the export of ammunition/munitions fired, launched or delivered by the
conventional arms covered under Article 2']{.underline}]{.mark}.64 An
identical obligation arises in relation to 'the export of parts and
components where the export is in a form that pro- vides the capability
to assemble the conventional arms covered under Article 2'.65 Both
ammunition/munitions and parts and components are also subject to the
prohibitions and risk assessments discussed below. By including am-
munition/munitions and parts and components, as well as whole items, the
Arms Trade Treaty increases the ability of States Parties to regulate
and restrict the means of committing atrocity crimes. **[[This reveals
the subtle influence of the secondary duty under
R2P]{.mark}]{.underline}** to 'help to protect populations' by
broadening the items that States Parties are required to regulate and
restrict [[in order to maximise the protection afforded to the most
vulnerable.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### R2P is used solely as a tool to [justify]{.underline} violent military intervention but is never actually used in situations to genuinely protect those in a vulnerable state

Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and laureate professor at

The [discussions about R2P]{.underline}, or its cousin "humanitarian
intervention," [are regularly disturbed by the rattling of a skeleton in
the closet: history, to the present moment]{.underline}. Throughout
history[, there have been a few principles of international affairs that
apply quite generally. One is the maxim of Thucydides that **the strong
do as they wish while the weak suffer as they must**.]{.underline} A
corollary is what Ian Brownlie calls "the hegemonial approach to
law-making": [the voice of the powerful sets precedents.]{.underline}
Another principle derives from Adam Smith's account of policy-making in
England: the "principal architects" of policy --- in his day the
"merchants and manufacturers" --- make sure that their own interests are
"most peculiarly attended to" however "grievous" the effect on others,
including the people of England, but but far more so, those who were
subjected to "the savage injustice of the Europeans," particularly in
conquered India, Smith's own prime concern. **[A third principle is that
virtually [every use of force in international affairs has been
justified in terms of R2P, including the worst
monsters.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Just to illustrate, [in his scholarly
study of "humanitarian intervention," Sean Murphy cites only three
examples between the Kellogg-Briand pact and the UN Charter: Japan's
attack on Manchuria, Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia, and Hitler's
occupation of parts of Czechoslovakia, all accompanied by lofty rhetoric
about the solemn responsibility to protect the suffering populations,
and factual justifications. The basic pattern continues to the
present.]{.underline}

[The historical record is worth recalling when we hear R2P]{.underline}
or its cousin [described as an "emerging norm" in international
affairs]{.underline}. They have been considered a norm as far back as we
want to go. The founding of this country is an example. [In 1629, the
Massachusetts Bay Colony was granted its Charter by the King, stating
that rescuing the natives from their bitter pagan fate is "the principal
end of this plantation." The Great Seal of the Colony depicts an Indian
saying "Come Over and Help Us."]{.underline} The English colonists were
thus fulfilling their responsibility to protect as they proceeded to
"extirpate" and "exterminate" the natives, in their words, "and for
their own good, their honored successors explained. In 1630, John
Winthrop delivered his famous sermon depicting the new nation "ordained
by God" as "a city on a hill," inspirational rhetoric that is regularly
invoked to this day to justify any crime as at worst a "deviation" from
the noble mission of responsibility to protect.

There is no difficulty adding similar examples from other great powers
in their day in the sun. **[[It is understandable that the powerful
should prefer to declare that we should forget history and look forward.
For the weak, it is not a wise choice.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The skeleton in the closet made an appearance in the first case
considered by the International Court of Justice 60 years ago, the Corfu
Channel case. The Court determined that it "can only regard the alleged
right of intervention as the manifestation of a policy of force, such as
has, in the past, given rise to most serious abuses and such as cannot,
whatever be the defects in international organization, find a place in
international law...; from the nature of things, [\[intervention\] would
be reserved for the most powerful states, and might easily lead to
perverting the administration of justice itself."]{.underline}

[The same perspective informed the first-ever meeting of the South
Summit of 133 states]{.underline}, convened in April 2000. [Its
declaration]{.underline}, surely with the bombing of Serbia in mind,
[rejected "the so-called 'right' of humanitarian
intervention]{.underline}, which has no legal basis in the United
Nations Charter or in the general principles of international law." The
wording reaffirms the important UN Declaration on Friendly Relations
(UNGA Res. 2625, 1970). It has been repeated since, among others by the
Ministerial Meeting of the Non-aligned movement in Malaysia in 2006,
again [representing the traditional victims in Asia, Africa, Latin
America, and the Arab world.]{.underline}

The same conclusion was drawn in 2004 by the high-level UN Panel on
Threats, Challenges and Change. The Panel adopted the view of the ICJ
and the Non-aligned Movement, concluding that "Article 51 needs neither
extension nor restriction of its long-understood scope." The Panel added
that "For those impatient with such a response, the answer must be that,
in a world full of perceived potential threats, the risk to the global
order and the norm of nonintervention on which it continues to be based
is simply too great for the legality of unilateral preventive action, as
distinct from collectively endorsed action, to be accepted. Allowing one
to so act is to allow all" --- which is, of course, unthinkable.

The same basic position was adopted by the UN World Summit in 2005.
While reaffirming stands that had already been accepted, the Summit also
asserted the willingness "to take collective action, ... through the
Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, ... should peaceful
means be inadequate and national authorities are manifestly failing to
protect their populations" from serious crimes. At most, the phrase
sharpens the wording of Article 42 on authorization for the Security
Council to resort to force. And it keeps the skeleton in the closet ---
if, and it is a large if, we can regard the Security Council as a
neutral arbiter, not subject to the maxims of Thucydides and Adam Smith,
a matter to which I will return.

There have been efforts to draw a sharp distinction between R2P and its
cousin. They may have some merit, but they go far beyond the evidence.
There is a good reason why "the right of humanitarian intervention" has
been hotly contested, in substantial part along North-South lines, while
R2P was affirmed --- more accurately reaffirmed --- by consensus at the
Summit. The reason is that the Summit acceptance of R2P rhetoric adds
nothing substantially new. The rights articulated in the crucial
paragraphs 138 and 139 of the Summit declaration had not been seriously
contested, and in fact had been affirmed and implemented, for example,
with regard to apartheid South Africa. Furthermore, the Security Council
had already determined that it can even use force under Chapter VII to
end massive human rights abuses, civil war, and violation of civil
liberties: Resolutions 925, 929, 940, June-July 1994. And as J. L.
Holzgrefe observes, "most states are signatories to conventions that
legally oblige them to respect the human rights of their citizens." [The
few successes of R2P that have been widely hailed, as in Kenya, had no
need for the Summit resolution, though the terminology of R2P was
invoked.]{.underline}

[In substance, R2P as formulated at the South Summit is a subcase of the
"right of humanitarian intervention," omitting the part that has been
contested: the right to use force without Security Council
authorization.]{.underline} That does not imply that there is no
significance to the more explicit focus on rights that had already been
widely accepted. The significance of the rhetorical shift will be
determined by how it is implemented. On that matter, there are few
grounds for celebration.

There have been departures from the Corfu Channel restriction and its
descendants. The Constitutive Act of the African Union asserts "The
right of the Union to intervene in a Member State, ... in respect of
grave circumstances." That differs crucially from the Charter of the
Organization of American States, which bars intervention "for any reason
whatever, in the internal or external affairs of any other state." The
reasons for the difference are clear. The OAS Charter seeks to deter
intervention by the "colossus of the North" --- and has of course failed
to do so. But after the collapse of the apartheid states, the African
Union faced no comparable problem.

If the African Union doctrine were to extend to the OAS or NATO, then
they would be entitled to intervene within their own alliances. That
idea yields interesting and revealing conclusions about the OAS and
NATO, which should not need elaboration. But the conclusions would be
inoperative, as in the recent past, thanks to the maxim of Thucydides.

I know of only one high-level proposal to extend R2P beyond the Summit
consensus and the African Union extension, namely, in the Report of the
International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty on
Responsibility to Protect (2001). The Commission considers the situation
in which "the Security Council rejects a proposal or fails to deal with
it in a reasonable time." In that case, the Report authorizes "action
within area of jurisdiction by regional or sub-regional organizations
under Chapter VIII of the Charter, subject to their seeking subsequent
authorization from the Security Council" ((3) E, II).

At this point, the skeleton in the closet rattles quite loudly. One
reason is that [the powerful unilaterally determine their own "area of
jurisdiction]{.underline}." The OAS and AU cannot do so, but NATO can,
and does. NATO unilaterally determined that its "area of jurisdiction"
includes the Balkans --- but not NATO itself, where shocking crimes were
committed against Kurds in southeastern Turkey through the 1990s, off
the agenda because of the decisive military and diplomatic support for
them by the Clinton administration, with the aid of other NATO powers.
NATO has also determined that its "area of jurisdiction" extends to
Afghanistan, and beyond. Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer
informed a NATO meeting in June 2007 that "NATO troops have to guard
pipelines that transport oil and gas that is directed for the West," and
more generally have to protect sea routes used by tankers and other
"crucial infrastructure" of the energy system. [[The expansive rights
accorded by the International Commission are in practice restricted to
NATO alone, radically violating the principles of Corfu Channel and its
descendants, and opening the door for **resort to R2P as a weapon of
imperial intervention at will.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The]{.underline} Corfu Channel [principle provides considerable insight
into both the timing of the rhetorical invocation of R2P]{.underline}
and its cousin, and the selectivity of their application in this new
incarnation. [The "normative revolution" declared by Western
commentators took place in the 1990s, immediately after the collapse of
the Soviet Union, which had, in earlier years, provided an automatic
pretext for intervention.]{.underline}

[The Bush senior administration reacted to the fall of the Berlin Wall
with an official exposition of Washington's new course: in brief,
everything will stay much the same, but with new pretexts. We still need
a huge military system, but for a new reason: the "technological
sophistication" of third world powers. We have to maintain the "defense
industrial base" --- a euphemism for state-supported high-tech industry.
We must maintain intervention forces directed at the Middle East
energy-rich regions --- where the threats to our interests that required
military intervention "could not be laid at the Kremlin's door,"
contrary to decades of pretense. **[New pretexts for intervention were
needed, and the "normative revolution" entered the stage --- once
again.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The natural interpretation of the timing gains support from the
selectivity of application of R2P]{.underline}. There was of course no
thought of applying the principle to the Iraq sanctions administered by
the Security Council, condemned as "genocidal" by the two directors of
the oil-for-food program, Denis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck, both of
whom resigned in protest. Von Sponeck's detailed study of the horrendous
impact of the sanctions has been under a virtual ban in the US and UK,
the primary agents of the programs. Similarly, [there is no thought
today of protection of the people of Gaza, also a UN responsibility,
along with the rest of the "protected population" (under the Geneva
Conventions), denied fundamental human rights. Nothing serious is
contemplated about the worst catastrophe in Africa, if not the world:
Eastern Congo, where only a few days ago, BBC reported, multinationals
are once again being accused of violating a UN resolution against
illicit trade of valuable minerals and thus funding the murderous
conflict.]{.underline}

In another domain, **[[there is no thought of invoking even the most
innocuous prescriptions of R2P to respond to massive starvation in the
poor countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The UN recently estimated that
the number of those facing hunger has passed a billion, while the World
Food Program of the UN has just announced major cutbacks of aid because
the rich countries are reducing their meager contributions, giving
priority to bailing out banks. Several years ago UNICEF reported that
16,000 children die every day from lack of food, many more from easily
preventable disease. The figures are higher now. In southern Africa
alone it is Rwanda-level killing, not for 100 days, but every day.
[There is surely ample warning, but no thought of action under R2P,
though it would be easy enough if the will were there.]{.underline}

In these and numerous other cases the selectivity conforms with painful
precision to the maxim of Thucydides, and the expectations of the ICJ 60
years ago.

[[Perhaps the most striking illustration of the consistent radical
selectivity was in 1999, **when NATO bombed Serbia, an attack featured
in Western discourse as the jewel in the crown of the "emerging norm" of
humanitarian intervention**]{.underline}]{.mark}, when the US was at the
"height of its glory" in leading the "enlightened states," and the
"idealistic New World bent on ending inhumanity" opened a new era in
history by acting on "principles and values," to cite just a few of the
accolades by Western intellectuals.

There are a few difficulties confronting this flattering self-image. One
problem is that [the traditional victims of Western intervention
vigorously objected]{.underline}. I have already quoted the stand of the
Non-aligned movement; [Nelson Mandela was particularly harsh in his
condemnation. That was unproblematic: the views of the unworthy are
easily ignored. Furthermore, the bombing plainly violated the UN
Charter. That problem too was easily put to rest. Some resorted to
legalistic maneuvering, but as the Goldstone Commission more
forthrightly determined, the bombing was "illegal but legitimate," a
conclusion reached by reversing the chronology of bombing and
atrocities]{.underline}. That leads to a third problem: the facts, which
happen to be richly documented from impeccable Western sources. What
they reveal is unequivocal. The [NATO bombing did not end the atrocities
but rather precipitated by far the worst of them, as had been
anticipated by the NATO command and the White House. The conclusions
that are so richly documented by the Western records are reinforced by
the indictment of MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡, issued by the International Tribunal at
the height of the bombing. With a single exception, the crimes charged
follow the bombing]{.underline}. And we can be confident that the one
pre-bombing charge --- the Racak massacre --- was of little principled
concern to the US and Britain, if only because at the very same time
they were not merely condoning but actively supporting much more serious
crimes in East Timor, where the background of atrocities was
incomparably more grotesque than anything that had happened in the
Balkans. And that is only one of many examples right at that time.

This problem too was overcome quite simply: by virtual suppression of
the ample record.

[The case of East Timor is particularly instructive]{.underline}. On a
personal note, I testified about it at the Fourth Committee in 1978,
when atrocities reached the level of "extermination as a crime against
humanity committed against the East Timorese population," in the words
of the later UN-sponsored Truth Commission, and Britain and France
joined the US in supporting them, along with Australia and others,
continuing to do so right through 1999 as atrocities sharply mounted
again. [After the final paroxysm of state terror]{.underline} in
September 1999, [which destroyed most of what remained of the country,
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said that the US would continue
its support for the aggressors, explaining that "[I don't think anybody
ever articulated a doctrine which said that we ought to intervene
wherever there's a humanitarian problem." **R2P vanished in the familiar
way**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

[To end the atrocities in this case would not have required bombing, or
sanctions, or indeed any act beyond withdrawal of
participation.]{.underline} That was demonstrated shortly after Berger's
reaffirmation of Western policy, [when]{.underline}, under strong
domestic and international pressure, [Clinton]{.underline} formally
[ended US participation. The invaders immediately withdrew, and a UN
peacekeeping force was able to enter facing no army.]{.underline} That
could have been done any time in the preceding quarter-century.
[Astonishingly, this horrendous story was soon reinterpreted as
vindication of R2P, a reaction so shameful that words fail.]{.underline}

I mentioned that the consensus of [the World Summit adheres to the Corfu
principle and its descendants only if we assume that the Security
Council is a neutral arbiter. It plainly is not.]{.underline} The
Council is controlled by its five permanent members, and they are not
equal in operative authority. One indication is the record of vetoes ---
the most extreme form of violation of a Security Council Resolution. The
relevant period is from the mid-1960s, when decolonization and recovery
from wartime destruction gave the UN at least some standing as
representative of world opinion. Since then, [the US is far in the lead
in vetoes, Britain second, no one else even close. In the past
quarter-century, China and France vetoed 3 resolutions, Russia four, the
UK ten, and the US 43, including even resolutions calling on states to
observe international law. The skeleton in the closet nods in
recognition as the maxim of Thucydides strikes again.]{.underline}

One way to mitigate this defect in the World Summit consensus would be
to eliminate the veto --- incidentally, in accord with the will of most
Americans, who believe that the US should follow the will of the
majority and that the UN, not the US, should take the lead in
international crises. But here we run up against Adam Smith's maxim,
which ensures that such heresies are unthinkable, as much so as applying
R2P right now to those who desperately need protection but are not on
the favored list of the powerful.

American public opinion brings up a further consideration. The maxims
that largely guide international affairs are not graven in stone, and,
in fact, have become considerably less harsh over the years as a result
of the civilizing effect of popular movements. For that continuing and
essential project, R2P can be a valuable tool, much as the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights has been. Even though states do not adhere
to the UD, and some formally reject much of it (crucially including the
world's most powerful state), nonetheless it serves as an ideal that
activists can appeal to in educational and organizing efforts, often
effectively. My suspicion is that a major contribution of the discussion
of R2P may turn out to be rather similar, and with sufficient
commitment, unfortunately not yet detectable among the powerful, it
could be significant indeed.

#### 'Responsibility to Protect' is a guise for military intervention in weaker countries\-\-- justifies U.S. imperialism

Glen **Ford 09**, BAR executive editor, "'Responsibility to Protect' is
Warmed-Over Imperialism," 7/28/2009,
https://www.blackagendareport.com/content/%E2%80%9Cresponsibility-protect%E2%80%9D-warmed-over-imperialism

The United Nations last week began what will become a protracted debate
over the doctrine ["Responsibility to Protect," or
[R2P]{.mark}]{.underline}. The doctrine [[is a warmed-over version of
so-called "humanitarian" military intervention -- another excuse for big
powers to make war on weaker nations]{.underline}.]{.mark} Its primary
champion in the Obama administration is [UN ambassador Susan Rice, who
would use the "Responsibility to Protect" doctrine to justify U.S.
military action in Somalia, Sudan and elsewhere. One important opponent
of R2P is Rev. Miguel D'Escoto, of Nicaragua, president of the UN
General Assembly.]{.underline}

[**["Responsibility to Protect" is reminiscent of the term
"protectorate" -- a legalism for a country that is run as a virtual
colony of one of the big powers.]{.mark}** That's how the UN's
predecessor, the League of Nations, took the colony of South West Africa
away from the defeated Germans, after World War One, and gave it to
white-ruled South Africa, under whom it would remain until emerging as
the independent Republic of Namibia, in 1990.]{.underline}

A "protectorate" is what the British and French established in much of
the Middle East on the ashes of the Ottoman Empire, also after World War
One, so they could "protect" the oil and ports and other resources of
the region from the people who lived there. Palestine was a British
protectorate, but that didn't protect the Arab majority from the
Zionists, who stole the land in 1948.

[Haiti is now a de facto "protectorate" of the United Nations, which
fronts for the United States, France and Canada. In fact, the new
version of protectorates -- philosophically buttressed by the doctrine
"Responsibility to Protect" -- was refined specifically to deny Haitians
sovereignty over their own country after the ouster of Haitian President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in 2004.]{.underline}

UN General Assembly president D'Escoto rejects the doctrine of
protectorates, under the guise of R2P. His country, Nicaragua, was
viewed, like all of Central America, as a protectorate of the United
States. The U.S. once considered Nicaragua as a dumping ground for freed
Black American slaves, and in the 1980s funded Contra terrorists and
mined Nicaraguan harbors in defiance of the World Court, which was
unable to provide protection from the Americans.

[Africa has turned decisively against the notion of "Responsibility to
Protect," as it has witnessed the lopsided protectionist "justice" of an
International Criminal Court that indicts only Africans, but does
nothing to protect Africa from U.S. and European
neocolonialism.]{.underline}

**[[Among those participating in the UN debate on R2P, is Noam Chomksy,
who describes the doctrine as "humanitarian
imperialism."]{.underline}]{.mark}** That certainly is what it would
amount to in the hands of the United States. Susan Rice's version of
[[R2P allows Washington to act unilaterally whenever it decides that
military intervention is in the best interest of humanity.]{.mark} In
practice, that's no different than the Bush doctrine, or all the other
previous American doctrines that have justified regime change at
Washington's political whim.]{.underline}

What the planet really needs protection from, is the United States,
which remains, as Dr. Martin Luther King said more than 40 years ago,
"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world."

[Guahan/[Guam]{.mark} is [a military colony of the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. **The people have [had]{.mark} US
citizenship, but [no voice in the decisions]{.mark} that have put a
third of their island [under]{.mark} US [military control.]{.mark}**
[This]{.mark} military neo-colonial/[colonial]{.mark}
[relationship]{.mark} involves not only visible [manifest]{.mark}ations
of military presence but also militarization, [a]{.mark} "step-by-step
process by which something becomes controlled by, [dependent]{.mark} on,
or derives its [value]{.mark} from the military [as]{.mark} an
[institution]{.mark} or militaristic criteria" (Enloe
2000:291).]{.underline}2On militarized Guahan/Guam, US strategic
concerns affect virtually all aspects of life.

[[Colonization]{.mark} for strategic purposes, or 'military
colonialism,' has two sides: the visible side [such as **military
bases**]{.mark} and hardware, and the less visible or 'soft' side
comprised of food, cultural tastes, markets, [and the **military
ideology**]{.mark} that [plays]{.mark} a fundamental role in the way the
society is governed (Gerson 2009:50). Military [colonization **brings
racialized and gendered beliefs of normality, citizenship, and safety,
as well as militarizing social relations**]{.mark}. The
[conflation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} notions of [citizenship]{.mark} as
[belong]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} the state/national collective with
military service and particular forms of **[masculinity, class, and
heteronormativity]{.mark}** are of particular significance here because
[they]{.mark} **[affect]{.mark} ideas, [identities]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
behaviors, militarizing bodies and changing the ways people understand
what it means to be a woman or a man.** 'Citizenship' both
[militarizes]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [normalizes]{.mark} [people into
colonial]{.mark}, neo-colonial, and national collectives and
[hierarchies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Otherization \-\-- 2NC

#### Militarism leads to otherization and the isolation of the 'enemy'\-\--using force as a mere means to an end perpetuates violence

Colleen **Burke 98**, Feminist Philosopher, "Women and Militarism",
1998,
https://www.wilpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Unknownyear_Women_and_Militarism.pdf

[[Militaristic **nationalism encourages polarization**]{.mark} in which
a group identity is defined as being [in opposition to the
\"other.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} Group membership is most obviously at
work within the military itself, where uniforms, communal living and
group activities all serve as identifiers of belonging to a particular
group. [[Nationalism]{.mark} affects civilians who begin to
[identify]{.mark} with \"[us\" and not \"them]{.mark},\" as the virtues
of one culture, race or ethnic group and the defects of the \"other\"
are both exaggerated. When nationalism is linked to militarism, [the
\"other\" becomes the \"enemy]{.mark}.\" This is cyclical: military
[ideology creates an \"enemy]{.mark}\" out of difference and then uses
the existence of this enemy to justify continued militarism. Thus,
\"power-over-the-other\" is extended beyond the boundaries of the
society.]{.underline}

The military system of belief contends that one of the main ways of
controlling society and ensuring social stability is through use of
organized violence and force. [[Militarism]{.mark} provides a context
for much violence in society. As the government [sees force as a
legitimate means to an end,]{.mark} or, in fact, an end in itself,
society is anesthetized to it and eventually comes to accept
it.]{.underline} This is reinforced in civilian life by [the media which
glorifies war, and portrays violence as necessary, combat as
exhilarating and aggression as natural. [As violence becomes accepted,
it is minimized through language which **distorts and sanitizes its
impac**]{.mark}**t**]{.underline}. Carol Cohn argues that military
\"doublespeak\" masks the lethality of nuclear weapons. Missiles are
called \"peacekeepers,\" civilian deaths become \"collateral damage,\"
and \"penetrating weapons\" hit \"virgin targets.\" Militaristic terms
have pervaded the english language, and are especially evident in
sports, with teams \"decimating\" and \"annihilating\" each other.
[While militaristic language and war movies may seem harmless, they are
symptoms of a society which minimizes the ramifications of military
activities and institutionalized violence. This [acceptance of coercion
and physical force as primary methods for solving problems can **extend
to violence in the home and in relationships**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"MILITARISM AND CLIMATE CHANGE -- THE ELEPHANT IN THE LIVING ROOM,"
<https://www.studentenergy.org/blog/428-militarism-and-climate-change-the-elephant-in-the-living-room>

[[Militarism is a complex]{.mark} social and cultural [phenomenon rooted
in the]{.mark} tradition of the [use of violence for the 'resolution' of
conflicts and stands for **the upkeep of military forces**, trained to
use extreme violence and destruction]{.mark}. It is [entrenched
in]{.mark} cultural believes, language and notions like [**patriotism,
identity and morality**, in]{.mark} hidden **[power structures that make
us accept militarism]{.mark} as well as in open practises like weapon
toys, camouflage clothing or media and entertainment.**]{.underline}

[[Militarism is accompanied by many forms of violence, like **ecological
violence**]{.mark} (which refers to particular damage of ecosystems from
armed conflict), predatory industries, cultural violence (which is aimed
at dehumanising opponents) [and **structural violence**]{.mark} (which
is directed at weakening economic systems to erode adversaries' bases of
existence). [All of these aspects collude to the detriment of our
natural environment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[There is lots of political discussion and concern about armed
conflicts' repercussions on human society and economy, but almost nobody
has made the case that climate change and warfare are
siblings.]{.underline} This might be due to the secretiveness and
concealment of military operations, bases and other facilities which are
often exempt from environmental laws as well as from the accountability
and transparency that are used for other governmental actors, in the
name of national security.

[[Worldwide militarism is responsible for enormous **greenhouse
emissions** and waste of energy.]{.mark} How much harm is done to our
natural environment can only be estimated, but there are voices that
regard militarism as the largest polluter on the planet.]{.underline}

#### War under militarism causes toxic emissions and pollution\-\--destabilizes climate change 

**Florian Polsterer 15,** Studied Law and Human Rights &

and Climate Change -- The Elephant in the Living Room", 2015,

[It is obvious that [during]{.mark} active [combat]{.mark} fighter
[jets]{.mark}, destroyers, [tanks]{.mark} [and]{.mark} whole
[arsenals]{.mark} of other weapon systems [are]{.mark} extremely
[carbon-intensive]{.mark} [and]{.mark} often [discharge]{.mark} other
highly **[toxic emissions]{.mark}**, not to mention the emissions that
are released by oil fires. Even though this causes catastrophic
devastation throughout the biosphere the active hostilities are only
responsible for a fraction of the actual damage to the
environment]{.underline}. [[What has mostly destroyed our]{.mark}
natural [environment]{.mark} and [is]{.mark} still active in its
destruction is the spread of industrial and [military]{.mark} methods
and mentalities especially in [production]{.mark}, [hindering]{.mark}
natural processes, upsetting local ecological [balances]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [increasing]{.mark} human exploitation all over the
world.]{.underline} Today the borders of war and peace are blurred. The
Industrial Revolution and the World Wars, among others, changed human
society and drastically increased industrial production. **[This new
[behaviour]{.mark} is essentially different [in]{.mark} regards to
consumerism and energy consumption with connections to fossil fuels,
deforestation, [toxic]{.mark} waste and general
[pollution]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The International Peace Bureau lists
a number of direct ways in which military activity affects our physical
environment[: **[Pollution]{.mark} of the air, land and water
[in]{.mark} peacetime Immediate and [long-term effects]{.mark} of armed
conflict (explosions, landmines, unexploded remnants, chemical weapons,
burning oil wells and oil spills, etc.) Land use (vast areas of land and
water occupied by military bases, target ranges, weapon stores, training
grounds; pollution and degradation from storage, deforestation, scorched
earth tactics, etc.)** Weapons development and production (design,
development, manufacturing, tests, storage, transport, disposal, etc.)
Militarisation of outer space (rocket launches, missile systems and
satellites, space littering) Additionally, indirect effects through the
diversion of resources have to be taken into account]{.underline}. In
fact, the environmental (and human) sufferings created by militarism are
so extensive that a complete examination would produce countless
volumes. Special attention has to be paid to the huge and permanent
costs of maintaining military equipment and personnel, who require
housing, infrastructure, heating, air conditioning, transport,
nourishment and many other goods and services. [The [production of
military equipment consumes enormous amounts of materials]{.mark}, like
metal, rubber, plastics and rare earths. Also there is massive energy
usage involved, mostly from unsustainable resources. Nuclear weapons are
particular heavyweights in production and maintenance, not to speak of
their dismantling. When there is no actual combat, 70% of soldiers'
activities are military exercises and training, [consuming]{.mark} vast
amounts of [ammunition and fuel]{.mark} and disrupting local
ecosystems.]{.underline} Also, military material and technology is by no
means faultless and accidents occur regularly. When all the facts above
are taken into account it seems quite possible that [**[militarism is
the biggest contributor to climate change]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} its
[massive]{.mark} GHG [emissions]{.mark}, destruction of ecosystems
[and]{.mark} biodiversity, massive waste of energy supplies, huge
impacts on social, cultural and economic behaviour,
**[destabilisation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} international [politics]{.mark}
and obstruction [of]{.mark} [climate]{.mark}
[policies]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Consequently, there can be no
successful overcoming the climate crisis without peace and dismantling

#### Environmental collapse is the biggest threat to extinction

Phil **Torres 16**, founding director of the X-Risks Institute, an
affiliate scholar at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies
"Op-ed: Climate Change Is the Most Urgent Existential Risk," 7/22/16,
https://futureoflife.org/2016/07/22/climate-change-is-the-most-urgent-existential-risk/

Humanity faces a number of formidable challenges this century. [[Threats
to our collective survival stem from]{.mark} asteroids and comets,
supervolcanoes, [global pandemics, climate change]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[biodiversity loss]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[nuclear weapons]{.mark},
biotechnology, synthetic biology, nanotechnology, and artificial
superintelligence]{.underline}.

With such threats in mind, an informal survey conducted by the Future of
Humanity Institute placed the probability of human extinction this
century at 19%. To put this in perspective, it means that the average
American is more than a thousand times more likely to die in a human
extinction event than a plane crash.\*

[So, given limited resources, which risks should we
prioritize?]{.underline} Many intellectual leaders, including Elon Musk,
Stephen Hawking, and Bill Gates, have suggested that artificial
superintelligence constitutes one of the most significant risks to
humanity. And this may be correct in the long-term. But I would argue
that two other risks, namely [[climate change and]{.underline}
[biodiveristy loss, should **take priority** right now over **every
other known threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Why? Because [[these ongoing catastrophes]{.underline}]{.mark} in
slow-motion [[will frame our existential predicament on
Earth]{.underline}]{.mark} not just for the rest of this century, but
[[for literally thousands of years]{.underline}]{.mark} to come. [As
such, they have the capacity to raise or lower the probability of other
risks scenarios unfolding]{.underline}.

Multiplying Threats

Ask yourself the following: are wars more or less likely in a world
marked by extreme weather events, megadroughts, food supply disruptions,
and sea-level rise? Are terrorist attacks more or less likely in a world
beset by the collapse of global ecosystems, agricultural failures,
economic uncertainty, and political instability?

Both government officials and scientists agree that the answer is "more
likely." For example, the current Director of the CIA, John Brennan,
recently identified "the impact of climate change" as one of the "deeper
causes of this rising instability" in countries like Syria, Iraq, Yemen,
Libya, and Ukraine. Similarly, the former Secretary of Defense, Chuck
Hagel, has described climate change as a "threat multiplier" with "the
potential to exacerbate many of the challenges we are dealing with today
--- from infectious disease to terrorism."

The Department of Defense has also affirmed a connection. In a 2015
report, it states, "Global climate change will aggravate problems such
as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual
leadership and weak political institutions that threaten stability in a
number of countries."

[Scientific studies have]{.underline} further [shown a connection
between the environmental crisis and violent conflicts]{.underline}. For
example, a 2015 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences argues that climate change was a causal factor behind the
record-breaking 2007-2010 drought in Syria. This [drought led to a mass
migration of farmers into urban centers]{.underline}, which fueled the
2011 Syrian civil war. Some observers, including myself, have suggested
that [this]{.underline} struggle [could be the beginning of World War
III, given the complex tangle of international involvement and
overlapping interests]{.underline}.

The study's conclusion is also significant because the Syrian civil war
was the Petri dish in which the Islamic State consolidated its forces,
later emerging as the largest and most powerful terrorist organization
in human history.

A Perfect Storm

The point is that climate change and [[biodiversity loss]{.mark} could
very easily [push societies to the brink of collapse]{.mark}. [This will
exacerbate existing geopolitical tensions and introduce entirely new
power struggles]{.mark}]{.underline} between state and nonstate actors.
At the same time, advanced technologies will very likely become
increasingly powerful and accessible. As I've written elsewhere, [the
malicious agents of the future will have **bulldozers rather than
shovels** to **dig** **mass graves for their enemies**]{.underline}.

[The result is a perfect storm of more conflicts in the world along with
unprecedentedly dangerous weapons]{.underline}.

[If the conversation were to end here, we'd have ample reason for
placing climate change and biodiversity loss at the top of our priority
lists. But]{.underline} there are other reasons they ought to be
considered urgent threats. I would argue that [[they could make humanity
more vulnerable to a catastrophe involving superintelligence and even
asteroids]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The basic reasoning is the same for both cases. Consider
superintelligence first. [Programming a superintelligence]{.underline}
whose values align with ours [is a formidable task]{.underline} even in
stable circumstances. As Nick Bostrom argues in his 2014 book, we should
recognize the "default outcome" of superintelligence to be "doom."

[Now imagine trying to solve these problems amidst a rising tide
of]{.underline} interstate wars, civil unrest, terrorist attacks, and
[other tragedies? The societal stress caused by]{.underline} climate
change and [biodiversity loss will almost certainly compromise important
conditions for creating friendly AI, such as sufficient
funding]{.underline}, academic programs to train new scientists,
conferences on AI, peer-reviewed journal publications, and
communication/collaboration between experts of different fields, such as
computer science and ethics.

[[It could even make an "AI arms race" more likely]{.mark}, thereby
raising the probability of a malevolent superintelligence being created
either on purpose or by mistake]{.underline}.

Similarly, [imagine that astronomers discover a behemoth asteroid
barreling toward Earth]{.underline}. Will designing, building, and
launching a spacecraft to divert the assassin past our planet be easier
or more difficult in a world preoccupied with other survival issues?

In a relatively peaceful world, one could imagine an asteroid actually
bringing humanity together by directing our attention toward a common
threat. But [if the "conflict multipliers" of]{.underline} climate
change and [biodiversity loss have already catapulted civilization into
chaos and turmoil]{.underline}, I strongly suspect that [humanity will
become more]{.underline}, rather than less, [susceptible to
dangers]{.underline} of this sort.

Context Risks

We can describe the dual threats of [[climate change and biodiversity
loss]{.underline}]{.mark} as "context risks." Neither is likely to
directly cause the extinction of our species. But both will define the
context in which civilization confronts all the other threats before us.
In this way, they [[could indirectly contribute to the overall danger of
annihilation --- and this]{.mark}]{.underline} worrisome [[effect could
be significant]{.underline}]{.mark}.

For example, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
the effects of climate change will be "severe," "pervasive," and
"irreversible." Or, as a 2016 study published in Nature and authored by
over twenty scientists puts it, the consequences of climate change "will
extend longer than the entire history of human civilization thus far."

Furthermore, a recent article in Science Advances confirms that humanity
has already escorted the biosphere into the sixth mass extinction event
in life's 3.8 billion year history on Earth. Yet another study suggests
that [[we could be approaching a sudden, irreversible, catastrophic
collapse of the global ecosystem]{.mark}. If this were to occur, it
could result in "widespread social unrest, economic instability and loss
of human life]{.underline}."

[[Given the potential for environmental degradation to **elevate the
likelihood** of **nuclear wars,**]{.mark} **nuclear
[terrorism]{.mark}**, engineered **[pandemics]{.mark}**, a
**superintelligence** takeover, **[and]{.mark}** perhaps even an
**[impact winter]{.mark}**, [it ought to **take precedence** over **all
other risk concerns**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- at least in the
near-term. Let's make sure we get our priorities straight.

**[[We cannot understand the]{.mark} [new]{.mark} world [order without
examining gender and militarism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Yet
[women's]{.mark} [invisibility in military affairs and policymaking
reflects]{.mark} taken-for-granted [international]{.mark} assumptions
about the [maleness]{.mark} of war. Even though they are more likely
than men to become war's casualties or refugees, [women have]{.mark}
little or [no say in making military or security
decisions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**[War and militarism become increasingly dangerous with]{.mark}** the
advent of **[new technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The past century
has witnessed the killing of about [[104 million people in
wars]{.mark}--- more than three quarters of all war dead recorded since
the year 1500]{.underline} (Hauchler and Kennedy 1994:183). [Most people
killed in war are civilians. But while 50 percent of the casualties in
World War II were civilians, in the 1980s this figure rose to 80
percent, and by 1990 it was a staggering 90 percent. [Women and children
constitute the vast majority of these civilian war
casualties.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**[Women are also most likely to be uprooted by war]{.mark}**; more
than four-fifths of war refugees are women and young girls, who often
experience additional violence during their flight. By the end of 1992
there were more than 46 million people who had lost their homes: about
36 million of these were women and girls.]{.underline} In Africa there
were more than 23.6 external and internal refugees; more than 12.6
people fled their homes in the Middle East and in South and Central
Asia. There are two million displaced persons in Latin America, and
about 6 million refugees in Europe. About 2 million people fled the
former Yugoslavia (Hauchler and Kennedy 1994:185). [[While stationed in
camps]{.mark} and refugee settlements, as well as in their new societies
f residence, **[women and girls suffer sexual abuse, abduction, and
forced prostitution]{.mark}**. During World War II the Japanese set up
[brothels i]{.mark}n East and Southern Asia, forcing between 100,000 and
200,000 women into prostitution.]{.underline} In the former Yugoslavia,
thousands of [Muslim women have been [forced into camps and
raped]{.mark} by Serbian soldiers. Muslim and Croat soldiers have also
committed mass rapes.]{.underline}

[[The continuing **invisibility of women** in war manifests
itself]{.mark}, for example, [in the fact that the widespread use of
wartime rape is still not recognized as a war crime]{.mark} by
international agencies. Violence is routinely used to control womens
sexuality and reproduction.]{.underline} Soviet soldiers raped
approximately two million women in eastern Germany in 1945, and in 1971
Pakistani soldiers raped more than 200,000 Bengali women in the
Bangladesh war o f independence. One estimate suggests that during the
war against Kuwait, Iraqi troops raped as many as 3,200 women between
August 1990 and February 1991 (Enloe 1994:186). [Most recently, in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, **[rape has been used as a weapon]{.mark}** for
ethnic cleansing, which uses attacks on women to humiliate another
ethnic group and [**to inflict genocide**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Dichotomy \-\-- 2NC

#### International humanitarian norms strips populations of their agency while creating a violent dichotomy between legitimate and illegitimate forms of violence through intervention

Mahmood **Mamdani 10**, director of the Makerere Institute of Social
Research (MISR), the Herbert Lehman Professor of Government at the
School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University and the
Professor of Anthropology, Political Science and African Studies at
Columbia University, "Responsibility to Protect or Right to Punish?",
3/26/2010, JOURNAL OF INTERVENTION AND STATEBUILDING VOLUME 4 NUMBER 1,
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17502970903541721>

This new humanitarian order claims responsibility for the protection of
'vulnerable populations'. That responsibility is said to belong to 'the
international community', to be exercised in practice by the United
Nations, and in particular the Security Council whose permanent members
are the great powers (Lloyd 2006, Pawson 2007).1 [The new order is
sanctioned by a new language that departs markedly from the older
language of democracy and citizenship. [It describes]{.mark} as 'human'
[the populations to be protected, and as]{.mark} '[humanitarian' the
crisis they suffer from, the intervention that promises to rescue them,
and the agencies that seek to carry out
intervention.]{.mark}]{.underline} Whereas the language of sovereignty
is profoundly political, that of humanitarian intervention is profoundly
apolitical, and sometimes even anti-political. Looked at closely and
critically, what we are witnessing is not a global, but a partial,
transition. The transition from the old system of sovereignty to a new
humanitarian order is confined to those states defined as 'failed' or
'rogue' states. [The result is a bifurcated system whereby state
sovereignty obtains in large parts of the world but is suspended in more
and more countries in Africa and the Middle East.]{.underline}

The Westphalian coin is still the effective currency in the
international system. It is worth looking at both sides of this coin:
sovereignty and citizenship. [If one side reads 'sovereignty', the
password to enter the passageway of international relations, the other
side upholds the promise of 'citizenship' as the essential attribute of
membership in the sovereign national political (state)
community.]{.underline} [Sovereignty and citizenship]{.underline} are
not opposites, but [go together: the state, after all, embodies the key
right of citizens, the right of self-determination.]{.underline}

[[The international humanitarian order,]{.mark} in contrast, is not a
system that acknowledges citizenship]{.underline}. Instead, **[it [turns
citizens into wards]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The language of humanitarian
intervention has cut its ties with the language of citizen rights. [To
the extent the global humanitarian order claims to stand for rights,
these are residual rights of the human and not the full range of rights
of the citizen.]{.underline} If the rights of the citizen are pointedly
political, [the rights of the human pertain to sheer survival; they are
summed up in one word, protection. [The new language refers to its
subjects not as bearers of rights -]{.mark} and thus active agents in
their own emancipation - [but **as passive beneficiaries of an external
'responsibility to protect'.**]{.mark} Rather than rights-bearing
citizens, beneficiaries of the humanitarian order are akin to recipients
of a charity. **[Humanitarianism does not claim to reinforce agency,
only to sustain]{.mark} bare [life]{.mark}.** If anything, **[its
tendency is to promote dependency. Humanitarianism heralds a system of
trusteeship]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.2]{.mark}

This language came into its own in 2006 when 150 Heads of State and
government met as the General Assembly of the UN in its 60th Anniversary
year and unanimously resolved:

Each individual state has the responsibility to protect its populations
from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity
. . . We accept that responsibility and will act in accordance with it .
. . The international community, through the United Nations, also has
the responsibility to help to protect populations from genocide, war
crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. In this context we
are prepared to take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner,
through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, including
Chapter VII \... should peaceful means be inadequate and national
authorities are manifestly failing to protect their populations from
genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.
(Evans 2007, pp. 1 /2)

This declaration enshrined 'the responsibility to protect' as a doctrine
integral to the new post-cold war international order. In a flush of
enthusiasm, the new African union (AU) overturned the principle of
non-interference of its predecessor, the OAU, declaring that Africans
can no longer be 'indifferent' to war crimes or gross abuses taking
place on their continent, and that claims of sovereignty should not be a
barrier to addressing them (Mepham and Ramsbotham 2007, pp. 6 /7). Not
surprisingly, there were afterthoughts. The ex- president of the
International Crisis Group laments: 'There has since 2005 been some
backsliding from this highpoint. One doesn't have to spend too much time
in the UN corridors, or in some Asian capitals in particular, before
hearing expressions of regret, or even denial, that so far-reaching a
doctrine could possibly have been agreed by national leaders' (Evans
2007, p. 1). What could have been the grounds for these afterthoughts?

The era of international humanitarian order is not entirely new. It
draws on the entire history of modern Western colonialism. [At the very
outset of Western colonial expansion in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, leading Western powers - UK, France, Russia - claimed to
protect 'vulnerable groups']{.underline}. When it came to countries
controlled by rival powers, such as the Ottoman empire, Western powers
claimed to protect populations they considered 'vulnerable', mainly
religious minorities such as specific Christian denominations and Jews.
[The most extreme political outcome of this strategy can be glimpsed in
the confessional constitution bequeathed by France on independent
Lebanon]{.underline}.3

When it came to lands not yet colonized by any power, such as South Asia
and large parts of Africa, [the practice was to highlight local
atrocities and pledge to protect victims against rulers. It was not for
lack of reason that the language of modern Western colonialism
juxtaposed the promise of civilization against the reality of barbaric
practices.]{.underline} In India, for example, the focus was on
practices such as sati, child marriage, infanticide, etc., whereas in
Africa the focus was on slavery in the nineteenth century, female
genital mutilation (FGM) in the late twentieth century and, now,
genocide. [The atrocities colonial archivists catalogued were not mere
inventions, but real and abhorrent practices. But all were cited to
serve a particular political purpose. **Whereas the crimes they
denounced were real, the technique of power was to turn victims into so
many proxies whose dilemma would legitimate colonial intervention as a
rescue mission.**]{.underline}

From this history was born the international regime of trusteeship
exercised under the League of Nations. [The League's trust territories
were mainly in Africa and the Middle East. They were created at the end
of the First World War, when colonies of defeated imperial powers (the
Ottoman Empire, Germany) were handed over to the victorious powers, who
pledged to administer them as guardians would administer wards, under
the watchful paternal eye of the League of Nations. One of these trust
territories was Rwanda, administered as a trust of Belgium until the
1959 Hutu Revolution (Mamdani 2001). It was under the benevolent eye of
the League of Nations that Belgium hardened Hutu and Tutsi into
racialized identities, using the force of law to institutionalize an
official system of discrimination between them. [There]{.mark}by,
Belgian colonialism laid the institutional groundwork of the genocide
that followed half a century later.]{.underline} [The Western
powers]{.underline} that constituted the League of Nations [could not
hold Belgian accountable for the way in which it exercised an
international trust for one simple reason: to do so would have been to
hold a mirror to their own colonial record]{.underline}, for Belgian
rule in Rwanda was but a harder version of the same indirect rule
practiced / to one degree or another / by all Western powers in Africa.
This system did not simply deny sovereignty to its colonies; it
redesigned the administrative and political life of colonies by bringing
each under a regime of group identity and rights. Though one could argue
that Belgian practice in Rwanda made for an extreme version, it
certainly was not exceptional. [Given the record of the League of
Nations, it is worth asking how the new international regime of
trusteeship would differ from the old one. What [are]{.mark} the likely
implications of the absence of citizenship rights at the core of this
system? Why would a regime of trusteeship not degenerate yet again into
one of lack of accountability and responsibility?]{.underline}

[On the face of it, these [two systems]{.mark} - [one defined by
sovereignty and citizenship, and the other by trusteeship and
wardship]{.mark} - would seem to be contradictory, rather than
complementary. In practice, however, [they are two parts of a single but
bifurcated international system]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [One may ask how
this dual bifurcated order is reproduced without the contradiction
being]{.underline}]{.mark} [flagrantly [obvious]{.mark}, without it
appearing like a contemporary version of the old colonial system of
trusteeship[. A part of the explanation lies in **how power has managed
to instrumentalize the language of violence and war, so as to subvert
its meaning to advantage.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Isn\'t this security[? [The idea that the military protects us is so
ingrained it\'s **hard to imagine anything else**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
In the Netherlands this week, thousands of people from five continents
will discuss realistic alternatives for human security, based on
research, analysis and practical experience. This is the Hague Appeal
for Peace. The organizers note that [\`\`[the past 99 years have seen
more]{.mark} death, and more [brutal death]{.mark}, from [war]{.mark},
[famine and other preventable causes than any other time span in
history]{.mark}. Those years have seen the tender flame of democracy
snuffed out again and again by crazed dictators, military regimes and
colossal international power struggles.\'\']{.underline}

These years have also witnessed effective movements for civil rights,
and monumental growth in scientific and technical knowledge that makes
possible a decent \-- not luxurious \-- life for everyone on the planet.
The United Nations\' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, if taken
seriously, could translate this possibility into reality. The Hague
Appeal for Peace is a five-day conference and a long-term campaign to
offer an opportunity for the global community talking about how to
achieve these basic conditions for human security: \-- A physical
environment that can sustain human life; \-- Adequate food, clothing and
shelter; \-- Respect for human dignity and for their different cultures;
and, \-- Protection from avoidable harm.

By these standards, [[**there are no truly secure societies in the
world**.]{.mark} [Military security actually goes against human
security]{.mark}, as defined here. **[Military security is maintained at
the expense of the natural environment, the economic and social needs of
many people, fundamental human rights in many countries and protections
against ill health, inadequate roads and unclean water, accidents and
disasters.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Our **global problems** are **interrelated** and constitute a

The [arms industry absorbs **colossal**]{.mark}]{.underline} amounts of

the [[**ecological crisis**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Meanwhile, [the

**violence** against **humans and nature**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[leaving no room for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[positive
programs]{.mark}** of social development and preservation of the

mirror-like inner extension the **militariza-tion of society**]{.mark},
infringement of civil liberties, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[neototalitarian control]{.underline}]{.mark}** over people.

We can no longer deny the obvious, which is that [[humanity finds
itself]{.mark} today [on a planet with]{.mark} a rapidly
**[deteriorating ecology]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the risk of
potentially becoming "Hiroshimized" on a global scale. The
["**[overkill]{.mark}**" capacity [of]{.mark} the existing stockpiles of
[thermonuclear weap-onry is **so enormous** that]{.mark} even if 90
percent of them were eliminated, the remaining [**10 percent**
would]{.mark} **still be enough** to
**[exterminate]{.mark}**]{.underline} much of the life on Earth, perhaps
even threatening [[**all life.** There exists]{.underline}]{.mark} not
only the immediate threat of living on the "powder keg" of the stocks of
nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, which can be detonated by
regional wars and explode at any time, but [[**also** the "**time
bombs**" of]{.mark} the escalating [**ecological crisis**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} of the [[**deteriorat-ing social-economic
conditions** in]{.mark} the [underdeveloped countries.
The]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[end of]{.underline}]{.mark}** history" of
[[**humanity** can come]{.mark} "not as a bang but [as a
**whimper**]{.mark}": [an entropy-like, **agonizing process of
degradation.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[These [threats]{.mark} to the human race [raise fundamental
**metaphysical questions** about the **meaning** of]{.mark}]{.underline}
history, limits, horizons, evil, noth-ingness, and the ~~suicidal~~
character of **[[war itself.]{.underline}]{.mark}** But they also put at
the forefront escalating social and global problems, such as the
deepening ecological crisis, third-world underdevelopment, and war in a
world full of weapons of mass destruction.

[Contemporary civilization has developed powerful means of destruction,
becoming their hostage.]{.underline} This reveals the dangerous gap
between sophisticated high-tech power and inadequate ethics, between the
world-wide effects of politicoeconomic activities and the lack of global
consciousness. [The use of violence is]{.underline} proven to be
[counterproductive and dangerous. [In an interrelated world]{.mark}, the
use of these powerful means]{.underline} by one individual or group for
evil ends [can result in a global catastrophe. [The ill-will of one
individual can provoke **irreparable damage to the
world**.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is obvious con-cerning a warmonger
leader using nuclear weapons. It is less obvious, but nevertheless true,
in the case of the cumulative effects of the actions of those, such as
corporate "robber barons" and [industrial polluters]{.underline}, who
[disregard the consequences of overexploi-tation of]{.underline} human
and [natural resources]{.underline}, thus [undermining the
economy]{.underline} and [destroying the environment. [The]{.mark}
collective [destiny of the world]{.mark} increasingly [depends
on]{.mark} the goals and [actions of **indi-viduals**, which **require

**[[ethical ideas of nonviolence]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
co-responsibility are not only individual concerns, but also [[have
**societal importance** and affect the **future of
humanity.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Humanity can **no longer afford to resort to violence** as a means of
dealing with]{.mark} problems]{.underline} concerning the common vital
interests of the many, [such as nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration, [human
rights violations, poverty, cultural homogenization, the ecological
crisis, and so forth.]{.mark} The esca-lating [global problems]{.mark}
[threaten the **future of the human race**]{.mark}, which faces a

[[Ideas of **new beginnings**]{.mark}, agendas [and **spatial horizons**
have]{.mark} long [been a feature of the geopolitical
imagination]{.mark}]{.underline} (Agnew and Corbridge, 1995). Since the
early-1990s, [[one]{.mark} such [imaginary]{.mark} (re-) scripted [by
Western]{.mark} political [elites is that they]{.mark} have **[moved
away from the state-centric agenda]{.mark}** of the Cold War era,
dominated by purely self-interested concerns for domestic economy,
security and power. **[According to]{.mark} the [rhetoric]{.mark}**, a
more [ethically-grounded foreign policy has taken its place]{.mark},
underpinned by universal moral principles and a commitment to promote
the protection of rights and freedoms of extra-territorial
citizens]{.underline}. [Critical geographers]{.underline} have been
quick to criticize these and similar socio-spatial imaginaries. Amongst
others, they [have argued]{.underline} that [[such scripts]{.mark}
have]{.underline} often **[[performed covert, instrumental
roles]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That is, [rather than marking a more
progressive moral turn in foreign policy action, [they are]{.mark}
**part-and-parcel of [a discursive strategy]{.mark}** which seeks [to
**legitimize existing security agendas, economic interests and**]{.mark}
**patterns of [domination over space]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Flint and
Falah, 2004; O'Loughlin and Kolossov, 2002; ÓTuathail, 2000; Power,
2003; Roberts et al., 2003; Sparke, 2007).

In the present paper, [[we]{.underline}]{.mark} set-out to [[scrutinize
the]{.underline}]{.mark} alleged [[gap between political imaginaries
and]{.mark} material [outcomes, using]{.mark} the example of **[Western
arms exports]{.mark}** to developing countries]{.underline}. Our basic
thesis is that [**[states' official commitment]{.mark}** to a
value-based arms controls policy [is]{.mark} largely a matter of
**[symbolic politics]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [with countries reluctant
to sacrifice national interests of economy and security in name of
protecting or advancing the rights and freedoms of extra-territorial
citizens]{.underline}. [Using quantitative data on large weapons
transfers]{.underline} from France, Germany, the UK and the US over the
period 1992--2004, [we find evidence to support our
arguments]{.underline}.

According to our statistical estimations, neither human rights abuses
nor autocratic polity would appear to reduce the likelihood of countries
receiving Western arms, or reduce the relative share of a particular
exporter's weapons they receive. In fact, human rights abusing countries
are actually more likely to receive weapons from the US, while
autocratic regimes emerge as more likely recipients of weaponry from
France and the UK. Reinforcing the impression that extra-territorial
ethical considerations are far from paramount, we show that [the
geography of Western arms exports is closely aligned with
self-interested, economically and geopolitically-important relational
ties]{.underline}. Hence developing countries which are more important
trading partners exhibit a greater probability of qualifying for arms,
as generally do countries which fulfill the domestic interests of the
supplying state extra-territorially as military allies. [Western
countries **have not**]{.underline}, it seems, **[systematically acted
counter to more conventional, materialist interests]{.underline}**.

Our statistical estimations say nothing about underlying causality, but
it would be difficult to square the above findings with behavioural
explanations based solely on hegemony. If power were indeed the decisive
variable, then the US should logically be expected to have shown a
greater propensity to defy international normative roles than the three
European states, both in the case of human rights and democracy. For
sure, the US hardly acts in the spirit of its self-declared ethical
principles, but nor does France or the UK. Both sets of countries have
systematically contravened one principle or another. Germany fares only
slightly better with respect to democracy, but not human rights
protection.

[What seems to matter more]{.underline}, at least in defining what
states can or cannot get away with, [are **domestic
institutions**]{.underline} (Donnelly and Liang-Fenton, 2004). [That the
US is more willing to overtly ignore human rights abuses than autocratic
government is broadly consistent with the idea that the country
is]{.underline}, first and foremost, [founded on democratic ideals
rather than humanitarian ones]{.underline} (Moss, 1995). Although far
from irrelevant, the domestic appropriateness of defending or promoting
democracy in non-domestic spaces would appear to be less deeply
institutionalized in Britain and France than in the US. Instead, partly
as a consequence of their historic role in colonialism, norms of
extra-territorial responsibility are centrally defined around human
rights.13 The idea that domestic institutions matter is also supported
by the German case -- the country with the ''least bad" record regarding
arms transfers. Germany's foreign policy identity, which was formed in
the shadow of an excessively autocratic, militaristic and human rights
violating past, is one where economic or geostrategic concerns are least
likely to trump the promotion of Western values (Erb, 2003).

[What are the implications of our findings?]{.underline} Most obviously,
[by exposing [the **hypocrisy underlying**]{.mark} **geopolitical
[imaginaries of ethical foreign policy]{.mark}**, they [remind]{.mark}
us [of the importance of **interrogating**]{.mark} **the [discursive
constructions of political leaders]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Flint and

This warning is of great relevance to the type of 'strategic'
interventions advocated by the authors. [[there are]{.mark} [serious
perils involved in making]{.mark} [any intervention in liberal-legalist
terms]{.mark} for critical scholars]{.underline}. the first is that --
as per their own analysis -- [liberal [legalism]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[is not]{.mark} a [neutral]{.mark} ground]{.underline}**, but one
which is likely to favour certain claims and positions. Consequently,
[it will be incredibly difficult to win the argument]{.underline}.
Moreover, [[even if the argument is won]{.underline}, [the
victory]{.underline} ]{.mark}[is likely to be a]{.underline} very
[particular one]{.underline} -- inasmuch as [**it [will
foreclose]{.mark} any [wider consideration of]{.mark} the
[structural]{.mark} or systemic [causes]{.mark}** of any particular
'violation' of the law.]{.underline} All of these issues are to some
degree considered by the authors.44 However, given the way in which
'strategy' is understood, the effects of these issues are generally
confined to the immediate, conjunctural context. As such, the emphasis
was placed upon the way that the **[[language of liberal legalism
blocked effective action and criticism of the
war.]{.underline}]{.mark}**45 [Much less consideration is placed on the
way in which advancing such argument impacts upon the long term
effectiveness of achieving the strategic goals outlined
above]{.underline}. Here, the problems become even more widespread.
[[Choosing to couch]{.mark} the [intervention in liberal legal
terms]{.mark} **[ultimately reinforces]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the
structure of [liberal legalism]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[rendering]{.underline} [it **more difficult**]{.underline} [to
transcend]{.underline}]{.mark} [[these arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}.46
[In the best case scenario that such an intervention is
victorious]{.underline}, [this [victory would]{.mark}]{.underline}
precisely [seem to **[underscore]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the liberal
position]{.underline}]{.mark} [on]{.underline} international
[law]{.underline}. [[Given]{.mark}]{.underline} that international [[law
is]{.mark} in fact [bound up with]{.mark} processes of
[exploitation]{.mark} and domination on a global scale]{.underline},
[[such a victory contributes to]{.mark} the **[legitimation of this
system]{.mark},** **making it very difficult to argue against its
logic.**]{.underline}

This process takes place in three ways. Firstly[, by intervening in the
debate on **its own terms,**]{.underline} [critical scholars reinforce
those very terms]{.underline}, [as their political goals are
incorporated into it.]{.underline}47 It can then be argued the law is in
fact neutral, because it is able to encompass such a wide variety of
viewpoints. [Secondly, [in discarding]{.mark} their [critical
tools]{.mark} in order to make a public intervention, these
[scholars]{.mark} [abandon]{.mark} their **[structural
critique]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[[at the]{.mark} very [moment]{.mark}
when [they should hold to it]{.mark} [most
strongly]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} that is to say, that [at the
point where there is actually a space to publicise their position, they
choose instead to cleave to liberal legalism]{.underline}. thus, [even
if,]{.underline} in [the 'purely academic' context, they]{.underline}
continue to [adhere to a 'critical' position,]{.underline} in public
political terms, **[they advocate liberal legalism]{.underline}**.
Finally, from a purely 'personal' standpoint, in advocating such a
position, they undercut their ability to articulate a critique in the
future, precisely because they will be contradicting a position that
they have already taken.

The second point becomes increasingly problematic absent a guide for
when it is that liberal legalism should be used and when it should not.
[Although the '[embrace' of]{.mark} liberal [legalism is]{.mark} always
[described as]{.mark} '**[temporary' or
'strategic']{.mark},**]{.underline} there is actually very little
discussion about the specific conditions in which it is prudent to adopt
the language of liberal legalism. It is simply noted at various points
that this will be determined by the 'context'.48 As is often the case,
[the term '[context' is invoked]{.mark}]{.underline}[49]{.mark}
[[without specifying precisely]{.underline} [which contexts are
those]{.underline}]{.mark} [that would necessitate intervening in
liberal legal terms]{.underline}. Traditionally, such a context would be
provided by a strategic understanding. that is to say, that the specific
tactics to be undertaken in a given conjunctural engagement would be
understood by reference to the larger structural aim. But
[here]{.underline}, [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} simply **[[no
considerations of this.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

It seems likely therefore, that again [[context is understood
in]{.mark}]{.underline} purely **[[tactical]{.mark}
[terms]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Martti Koskenniemi can be seen as
representative in this respect, when he argued:

What works as a professional argument depends on the circumstances. I
like to think of the choice lawyers are faced with as being not one of
method (in the sense of external, determinate guidelines about legal
certainty) but of language or, perhaps better, of style. the various
styles -- including the styles of 'academic theory' and 'professional
practice' -- are neither derived from nor stand in determinate
hierarchical relationships to each other. the final arbiter of what
works is nothing other than the context (academic or professional) in
which one argues.50

On this reading, the 'context' in which prudence operates seems to the
immediate circumstances in which an intervention takes place. this would
be consistent with the idea, expressed by the authors, that the
'strategic' context for adopting liberal legalism was that the debate
was conducted in these terms. But the problem with this understanding is
surely evident. [As critical scholars have shown time and time
aga]{.underline}in, [the contemporary world is one that is deeply
saturated with,]{.underline} and partly constituted by, **[juridical
relations]{.underline}**.51 Accordingly, there are really very few
contexts (indeed perhaps none) in which political debate is not
conducted in juridical terms. A brief perusal of world events would bear
this out.52 the logical conclusion of this would seem to be that in
terms of abstract, immediate effectiveness, [the 'context' of public
debate will almost always call for an intervention that is couched in
liberal legalist terms.]{.underline}

This raises a final vital question about what exactly distinguishes
critical scholars from liberal scholars. If the above analysis holds
true, then [the '[strategic' interventions of]{.mark} critical
[scholars]{.mark} [in]{.mark} legal and political [debates will]{.mark}
almost always [take the form of arguing]{.mark} these [debates in their
own terms]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} simply [picking the
'left' side]{.underline}. thus, [whilst their academic and theoretical
writings and interventions may]{.underline} (or may not) [retain the
basic critical tools]{.underline}, [the public political interventions
**will**]{.underline} basically **[be 'liberal'.]{.underline}**

The question then becomes, in what sense can we really characterise such
interventions (and indeed such scholars) as 'critical'? [[The]{.mark}
practical [consequence of]{.mark} understanding ['strategy' in]{.mark}
essentially [tactical terms]{.mark} [seems]{.mark} to mean [**always
struggling** **within**]{.mark} **the [coordinates of the]{.mark}
[existing order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Given the exclusion of strategic
concerns as they have been traditionally understood, there is no
practical account for how these coordinates will ever be transcended (or
how the debate will be reconfigured). As such, we have a group of people
struggling within liberalism, on liberal terms, who may or may not also
have some 'critical' understandings which are never actualised in public
interventions. We might ask then, [[apart from '**good
intentions'**]{.underline}]{.mark} (although liberals presumably have
these as well) [[**what differentiates these scholars from
liberals**?]{.underline}]{.mark} Because of course liberals too can
sincerely believe in political causes that are 'of the left'. It seems
therefore, that [[ju]{.mark}st as]{.underline} -- in practical terms --
[strategic essentialism collapses into essentialism]{.underline},
**[[so]{.mark} too does '[strategic']{.mark} liberal [legalism]{.mark}
[collapse into]{.mark} [plain]{.mark} old liberal
[legalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**.53

Discourses*, https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3998/mpub.5031921

All of these movements of desire and enjoyment are bound to the
struggles over the making of "common sense." The [production of
[discursive hegemony is]{.mark} simultaneously th[e production of
affective investments]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the particular
[representations of common sense.]{.mark} The \"universal" signifiers
that every society generates are always ambiguous, intrinsically empty,
despite their adherents\' views and feelings to the contrary.
["Universal" values are]{.mark} therefore [never truly
universal]{.mark}]{.underline} in and of themselves [[but become
meaningful]{.mark} only [when their emptiness is filled]{.mark} in with
a particular content. The battles waged through this filling function
comprise much of what we call politics]{.underline}. Yet there is more
to these battles than discourse. [[Discourses often entice and carry
with them subjects\' investments in]{.mark} particular [images of who
they are]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Particular [instances of
discourse come to be seen as universal because of the fantasy functions
that they often serve.]{.underline} Such [investments crystallize what
eventually becomes common sense. The same movements constitute both
investments via fantasies and the political fillings of hegemony. Just
as fantasies of missing objects act as stand-ins for full being,
[hegemony is achieved when a particular political discourse comes to be
seen as the "universal" story of who "we" are]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
both cases[, a particular content tries to fill in an absent (and
ultimately illusory) wholeness]{.underline}. In this sense, the
[structural movements constituting both the subject and discursive
hegemony are the same.]{.underline} Desire and enjoyment accordingly are
not only the sparks setting alight the social construction process but
also the stakes of the political battles over filling the ultimately
ambiguous meanings of who \"we" are.

Ultimately, since we are subjects of desire, [social critique must be
aimed at desire]{.underline}. The [political formation of subjectivity
is the shaping of our desires and modes of enjoyment]{.underline}---in
other words, the shaping of our investments in the images we have and
the stories that we tell about ourselves. In this sense, a
[[critique]{.mark} [focused on]{.mark} the hold of [desire and enjoyment
suggests taking a step beyond contemporary notions of
denaturalization]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an important sense, [social
**[critique must aspire to deconstruct and denaturalize discourses of
power. All discourses of power strive to solidify themselves as
inevitable, as common sense.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Yet since no
discourse becomes the closed social totality toward which it aims,
[criticism must make apparent this intrinsic contingency. Resistance to
power entails rendering contingent that which fashions itself as
concrete]{.underline}, making apparent that which seems covered over,
and remembering possibilities that have been forgotten. Yet on another
level, it is often not enough to merely sound out hollow foundations.
[[Criticism must also aim at how and what we
desire]{.underline}.]{.mark} Effective [critique must be leveled against
the modes of investments in our subjection]{.underline}. Such
[investments must be shaken, displaced, disinvested.]{.underline}
Against discourses that endeavor to totalize sweeping violence,
[efficacious criticism must not only contest seemingly fixed social
meanings but work on investments produced by the desires for meaning
through such discourses.]{.underline}

# Sovereignty Bad

#### Schmitt's theory allows for the rise of authoritarianism---authoritarians adopt the same friend and enemy distinctions in their decision making

David **Lewis 16,** Senior Lecturer, Politics, University of Exeter
\"Carl Schmitt: Nazi-era philosopher who wrote blueprint for New
Authoritarianism,\" Conversation, 5/25/16,
https://theconversation.com/carl-schmitt-nazi-era-philosopher-who-wrote-blueprint-for-new-authoritarianism-59835

[[Schmitt argues that effective states need a truly sovereign
leader]{.mark} who is [not shackled by]{.mark} constitutions,
[law]{.mark}s and treaties.]{.underline} A truly sovereign president who
will cut through red tape and take whatever action is necessary.

[This is the [über-sovereignty]{.mark} that [allowed]{.mark} Putin to
annex [Crimea in 2014]{.mark} without paying attention to international
law. [It's]{.mark} the mode of decision-making implied by [Trump's
announcement that he will "build a]{.mark} great, great [wall]{.mark}"
along the US-Mexican border, or his claim that you can't beat Islamic
State by "playing by the rules". And it's exactly this approach that
Duterte invokes in his clampdown on crime, bypassing the courts and
"getting criminals off the streets".]{.underline}

**[["The rule of law is an obstacle to be overcome -- not a principle to
be embraced"]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And many voters agree: they want
political leaders who are getting results, not talking to lawyers.

But the price for this Schmittian sovereignty is high: [it needs the
executive to control the legislature, the courts and often the
media]{.underline}. In Russia, parliament has become a rubber-stamp, the
courts are dutiful allies of the Kremlin and the media is largely under
state control. In Turkey, Erdoğan has subdued the country's courts and
locked up scores of journalists. In February 2016 he said he would not
respect a constitutional court ruling that resulted in the release of
two journalists -- the pair were subsequently jailed after a further
trial. [The US democratic system may be remarkably resilient, but [it's
anybody's guess what a President Trump might do if courts or congress
blocked his most radical ideas]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Us and them

**[[Schmitt's]{.mark} second big [idea is]{.mark} that [politics is
fundamentally about the distinction between friends and
enemies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Liberal democracies are hypocritical,
says Schmitt. They have constitutions and laws that pretend to treat
everybody equally, but this is a sham. All states are based on a
distinction between "them" and "us", between "friend" and "enemy". A
nation needs to constantly remind itself of its enemies to ensure its
own survival.

[**[The new authoritarians embrace]{.mark} Schmitt's [friend/enemy
distinction]{.mark} with gusto**. [Trump]{.mark} [has]{.mark} a litany
of opponents -- [Mexicans]{.mark}, [Muslims]{.mark}, [the]{.mark}
[Chinese]{.mark} -- that seek to undermine America. [In Russia, it's the
US]{.mark} that serves as Public Enemy Number One. In Hungary, migrants
from the Middle East fill the role.]{.underline}

But -- as Schmitt's experience of Nazi Germany proved only too well -- a
nation defined in terms of external enemies quickly finds internal foes
too[. In Russia, [Putin warned against]{.mark} a "fifth column" of
"[national]{.mark} [traitors]{.mark}". [In Turkey more than
2,000]{.mark} people [have been prosecuted]{.mark} since April 2014 on
charges of "insulting" Erdoğan -- and academics, journalists and
political opponents are attacked as enemies of the Turkish state. [For
Trump]{.mark}, too, [there are plenty of internal enemies]{.mark}, not
least "disgusting reporters" in the much hated "liberal
media".]{.underline}

Sovereignty is a form of governance with characteristics such as
constitutions, laws and governing authorities. \'The right of the state
in international and national law to control the entry and residence of
individuals within its borders is today taken as one of the essential
conditions of sovereignty\' (Dua. 2003: 41). [We see [the use of
sovereignty with the exclusion]{.mark} of the lepers in the Middle Ages
as sovereign authority [was exercised through a **combination of laws
and regulation**]{.mark}, as well as religious rituals, [which brought
about a binary division]{.mark} between those who were Iepers and those
who were not]{.underline} (Foucault. 2007 \[1978\]: 9). [In other words,
[to maintain control of the territory, the sovereign authority
illustrates his power over the inhabitants by separating and
excluding]{.mark}]{.underline} the contagious Iepers. [This example
displays how **[sovereign power is exercised in relation to subjects of
the state\'s territory through various mechanisms such as exclusionary
laws and regulations]{.mark}**, leper colonies, etc. [Sovereignty
supports and sets up the conditions of possibility for discipline to
surface.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Analysis of the NGO Campaigns to Ban Landmines and Cluster Munitions",

[Particularly [for smaller]{.mark} and middle [powers, aspects of
foreign policy have increasingly been **delegated to internationalised
civil society components of integral states**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline}
as a means of increasing those states' international influence and
enabling them to 'punch above their weight'. The 'Norwegian model' is a
particularly conscious example of this foreign policy strategy, as is
Canadian diplomats' reference to NGOs as an increasingly useful part of
their 'diplomatic tool-kit' (Lawson 1997a, p.23). Of course, this is not
an entirely novel development, given it has been an element of Western
states' foreign policy at least since the role of religious groups in
colonialism, but it has intensified in recent decades in the context of
neoliberal governance trends towards privatisation and outsourcing.
[Liberal-constructivist [theorists have interpreted this development in
terms of a power shift from states to civil
society]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas from a class-based Gramscian
perspective, it appears more that similar governance functions and
social interests are being represented in a somewhat different way. In
the process, governance functions formerly carried out directly by
government agencies have been outsourced to NGO and professional
intellectuals that would previously been employed by states or joined
political parties in the days of mass membership and are now working for
NGOs, carrying out similar functions in a privatised and more
depoliticised capacity. From the perspective of a Gramscian
understanding of intellectuals as secondary hegemonic subjects that
theorise and organise hegemonic ideas and projects on the part of the
dominant class, such 'leadership' can originate 'from' positions in
civil society, so long as the ideas involved are compatible with the
fundamental interests of the dominant class, domestically and
internationally. [**This [closer integration of NGOs into
state-dominated national and international governance system]{.mark}**[s
helps to explain the campaigns' **dependency on insider
tactics**]{.mark} and [the bounded nature of their
discourses]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which [did not]{.mark}]{.underline},
and indeed could not, [have [challenge]{.mark}d [the nature of the
governance system within which they were embedded]{.mark} as it was
[this system itself]{.mark} that [gave NGOs resources and
influence]{.mark} and constituted them as actors]{.underline}. Another
way in which presenting NGO influence as reflective of a power shift is
misleading is that in respect of the multi-actor partnerships or
transnational advocacy networks involved in the landmines and cluster
munitions campaigns, [it implies [NGOs']{.mark} small and middle power
partners have fundamentally different interests to their great power
allies, and would [seek to **meaningfully challenge** **international
hegemonic power structures**,]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than serving a
complementary, legitimising role. Historically, middlepowermanship has
taken the form of acting as a 'helpful fixer' for larger powers in
assisting the smooth running of the international system, a role still
apparent in Canada and Ireland's behaviour during the final negotiations
of the landmines and cluster munitions treaties. [Latterly, [it has also
involved a more pro-active 'heroic' role]{.mark} (Michaud and Belanger
2000), [in which small]{.mark} and middle [powers promote new
international norms]{.mark} that may be opposed by larger
powers]{.underline} -- as also occurred in the landmines and cluster
munitions campaigns. What liberal analyses of such 'heroic' behaviour
tend to overlook is the extent to which small and middle powers
promoting these norms endeavour to persuade larger allies they are in
its long-term hegemonic interests and that of Western hegemony at the
international level generally. That this was not an 'unreasonable'
argument is suggested by the ready support of individual liberal elites
in the US and other great powers, such as Senator Patrick Leahy and
George Soros, who could perceive banning these weapons as in their
countries' enlightened long-term, or hegemonic, interests. Consequently,
appeals to US hegemonic 'leadership' were at the core of Leahy's (1997a)
arguments for why the US should support the landmines ban , just as they
were for the lead US NGOs (Muller 1994b, pp.69--70). That this has not
so far proved persuasive to the US does not invalidate the compatibility
of the bans with US interests, as it could sign to both of them without
appreciably affecting its overwhelmingly military dominance and such a
decision would merely represent a change in hegemonic strategy. [This
suggests [NGO intellectuals]{.mark}, small and middle powers, and IGOs
[can 'lead' within certain parameters, so long as their demands do **not
'touch the essential'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gramsci 1971, p.161)
**[[limits of hegemonic politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this
respect, an explanation for the emergence of partnerships between NGOs,
international agencies like the UN and ICRC and Western small and middle
powers allied with the US is that all of them play similar
consensual-hegemonic roles vis-à-vis the international system and global
governance, but only 'material' middle powers like Canada and Norway, as
opposed to smaller states like Ireland or New Zealand that merely aspire
to behave like middle powers, appear capable of leading the sort of
standalone diplomatic processes in which the landmines and cluster
munitions

treaties were negotiated. For their part, NGO/civil society
participation and acclamation gives the international system and
individual states a democratic veneer that policy input from different
government departments does not, creating another advantage to
outsourcing foreign policy formation to NGOs additional to its lower
cost and the potential benefits of distancing certain activities, such
as demining from direct state responsibility. With respect to the
international system, [small and middle powers play a similar
legitimising role for reasons of both domestic and international
hegemony. [Maintaining their domestic hegemony depends in part on
maintaining the legitimacy of the international system]{.mark} of which
they are a part,]{.underline} which in the case of Western small and
middle powers such as Canada and Norway has historically meant promoting
'liberal' interpretations of Western international hegemony that
sections of other Western states with consensual-hegemonic functions
also often see as in their domestic hegemonic interests, but which have
historically proved more persuasive in weaker military powers. As a
Canadian strategic policymaker once put it, "We talk about the rule of
law because we don't have aircraft carriers" (quoted in Brysk 2009,
p.92). [The explanation of the nature and conditions of NGO influence
that emerges from these case studies is that the soft power of NGOs is
derived from the material power of supportive elites, which, consistent
with Gramsci's Marxist concept of base and superstructure, delimited NGO
practices, in the sense of their aims, discourse and
tactics]{.underline}. In both cases, there was a clear correspondence
between the material base of the campaigns -- externally dependent on
Western elites, both financially and in personnel terms and organised in
such a way as to reproduce wider inequalities in the interstate system
and the global economic structure -- [[their discursive and tactical
practices and the direct and indirect outcomes they produced, which were
system-reinforcing, rather than system challenging]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Hence, in this way the campaigns' 'superstructures' reflected their
material base in the bounded criticisms made by NGOs of government
policy]{.underline}. In conclusion, the landmines and cluster munitions
campaigns span a period of significant change in the international
system. The liberal optimism, evident in the academic literature, which
characterised the immediate post-Cold War period, appeared to many as
justified in light of the success of the landmines campaign. [But
although by the beginning of the 21st century significant changes had
occurred in how states and civil society interacted in the international
system]{.underline}

[compared to a decade earlier, this did not amount to a power shift from
states to civil society,]{.underline} or an incremental democratisation
of global governance. Rather, the analysis of the cluster munitions
campaign in this thesis demonstrates that trends evident in the
landmines campaign, which were indicative of a changing international
system, have since solidified. [**[In essence,]{.mark}** both the
landmines and cluster **[munitions campaigns demonstrate that NGOs as
part of civil society are inextricably linked with and support specific
state elites]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the corollary of which is that they
have less close engagement with, or are in opposition to other elite
groups within the state. This reflects a wider shift in the
international system due to an increased transnationalisation of elite
competition within and among states at the levels of both political and
civil society.

Within the IR literature [[there is]{.mark} a [perennial admonition to
**make theory**]{.mark} **more '[relevant' to policy
makers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but this is usually cast in
problem‐solving terms: producing knowledge that solves the problems
faced by the existing political framework. (Lepgold, 1998; Eriksson and
Sundelius, 2005; Walt, 2005). Many of [[those engaged in critical
theorizing resist]{.underline}]{.mark} such [[demands to be
'useful]{.mark},' suspicious of]{.underline} the operationalization of
[academic work [in oppressive systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, and tend
towards a position of 'resistance' to the system as a whole. Critical
security studies scholar Anna Stavrianakis (2012, p. 233) for example,
calls on disarmament activists to demand 'transgressive change that
fundamentally alters the social landscape as well as generates concrete
improvements' rather than calling for 'incremental changes that leave
the parameters of an issue untouched'. Given the centrality of discourse
to critical theorizing, [[resistance is]{.mark} often [framed **not in
terms of**]{.mark}]{.underline} taking territory, mobilizing bodies,

critical [[deconstruction]{.mark} of oppressive discourse [and
disruption]{.mark} of existing norms]{.underline} (e.g. Hargreaves,
2012). As a result, many [[critical]{.mark} IR [scholars see]{.mark}
their [academic work]{.mark}]{.underline} -- undermining dominant
discourses through [[their scholarship]{.underline}]{.mark} and teaching
-- [[as]{.mark} their primary form of [resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}.
(Said, 1996).

An emerging generation of political actors were educated by
post‐positivist and critical IR scholars and conceive of their work
self‐consciously in discursive terms. That is, they frame their
intervention in the political arena as a deliberate attempt to reshape
the way society speaks about and gives meaning to a particular
phenomenon, people, group or activity. Occupy Wall Street activists drew
upon critical and discursive theories to strategize their symbolic
disruption of the neo‐liberal order (Welty, 2013). LGBTQA activists and
'third wave' feminists are trying to change dominant discourses of
gender and sexuality (e.g. St. Pierre, 2000). However, [[critical theory
has had **less impact** on]{.underline}]{.mark} the realm of
[international [military and security policy]{.mark}, which remains
heavily influenced by realist thought]{.underline} (Cooper, 2006).

As critical theorizing has begun to be used for solving definable
political problems (e.g. Davies, 2012; Merlingen, 2013), what Brown
(2013) calls '[[critical problem‐solving theory]{.mark}']{.underline},
it [has [eroded]{.mark}]{.underline} Cox\'s (1981) [[boundary between
'problem‐solving' and critical theories]{.underline}]{.mark}. What
happens when a theoretical paradigm that explicitly defines itself in
critical opposition is instrumentalized and used in problem‐solving
ways? This question, which we begin to explore in this article, is
underexamined in the literature (see Weizman, 2012, pp. 185--220 for an
important exception).

According to the epistemic community literature (e.g. Haas 2004), the
[[education of policy makers can shape]{.mark} their later
[actions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Eriksson and Sundelius, 2005). Most
usefully for this article, it shows how [at critical junctures [policy
makers]{.mark} will [turn to experts. Policy makers]{.mark} tend to be
less interested in meta‐theory or broad academic debates]{.underline}
about an issue. Rather, [they [look for knowledge that can]{.mark} be
**used instrumentally to [solve a particular]{.mark} policy
[problem]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. Hall, 1993). [But [moving]{.mark}
theoretical [ideas from academia]{.mark}, through the activist
community, [to]{.mark} the [policy]{.mark} arena, dilutes the original
ideas and [reinterprets them in instrumental ways]{.mark}]{.underline}.
To help understand this, we draw on postcolonial concepts of
'translation' and 'creolization' of different 'knowledge systems' pushed
into contact (Shih and Lionet, 2011, p. 30). We find that some ICAN
[[campaigners]{.underline}]{.mark} responsible for its current strategy
[have '[translated' IR]{.mark} discursive [theory into]{.mark} the world
of disarmament [policy making]{.mark}]{.underline}. In doing so, [[they
selected]{.mark} the [aspects of critical]{.mark} security [studies 'to
transpose]{.mark} and emphasize']{.underline} (cf. Tymoczko, 2000 p. 24)
[[as befit their]{.mark} specific political [goals]{.mark}. This
creative [application of]{.mark} critical [theory in a new
setting]{.mark}]{.underline}, in its translation of theory into
political engagement, [may [necessarily involve rendering it **less
threatening to elite audiences**]{.mark}, in the process of **[seeking
policy changes]{.mark}**]{.underline} (cf. Jeffrey, 2013, pp. 107--131).

#### Policymakers must take national interest above all other interests\-\--it's the only ethical option

William F. **Felice 2008**, Professor of international political
economy, international law, international organization, and human rights
at New York University, "Moral Responsibility in a Time of War", Social
Justice/Global Options, https://www.jstor.org/stable/29768499

Ethics, also known as moral philosophy, attempts to distinguish between
right and wrong behavior[. [Ethical theories have been applied to war
and violence with \"just war\" theories influencing
policymakers]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [[the **intellectual
framework used by**]{.mark} the overwhelming majority of the world\'s
**[foreign policy decision-makers is]{.mark}** an \"amoral\" calculation
of **[what action best serves the \"national
interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" [The first-rate foreign policy expert
will give absolute priority to the interests of his or her nation, which
often means neglecting and opposing the material interests of those
outside this partial community. [Through this lens, **policy options
pose few moral dilemmas**,]{.mark} as [these decisions are]{.mark}
merely practical solutions [to real-world problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Some who call themselves \"[[political realists\" share such a view of
the separation of ethics from politics.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To a classical political realist, history demonstrates that states must
focus on power and wealth to survive in the international system.
Morality has a limited role to play in this anarchical, dangerous world.
Since the time of Thucydides in ancient Greece, states have consistently
chosen power over negotiated diplomatic agreements, with the \"logic of
fear and escalation\" always pushing out the \"logic of moderation and
peaceful diplomacy.\" This overriding priority of \"national security\"
means that ethics plays an extremely circumscribed role in the
deliberations of states. Many realists argue that in international
politics \"only the weak resort to

moral argument\" (Smith, 1986: 6-7).

[Many powerful officials in the U.S. government have stated strongly
that, in their view, moral considerations have no place in
politics.]{.underline} For example, Dean Acheson, former secretary of
state under President Harry Truman, was asked by President Kennedy in
1962 to serve on the Executive Committee to advise the president on an
appropriate response to the Cuban missile crisis. Acheson later wrote
that during these discussions, when the lives of millions of people were
in danger, \"those involved\...will remember the irrelevance of the
supposed moral considerations brought out in the discussions\...moral
talk did not bear on the problem\" (Acheson, 1971; Coady, 1993: 373).
[Realist counsel has traditionally excluded morality from foreign
policy]{.underline} and instead focused solely on the \"national
interest.\" Yet, this does not mean that no ethics apply to statecraft.
Rather, a difference is accepted in the morals that apply to individuals
versus those that apply to the state. An individual can base his or her
conduct on principles such as honesty and nonviolence. In contrast, the
state must protect its position of \"power\" in the international
system. This means that the state should not engage in ideological
crusades for democracy and freedom that could dilute its power. Yet key
\"realist\" virtues enhance the state\'s power position and thus must be
embraced. These ethical norms are said to include prudence, humility,
study, responsibility, and patriotism. Such an approach allows leaders
to conduct a responsible and tough defense of the national interest, but
still show respect for others. The claim made for the cosmopolitan
significance of this realist approach has been named \"ethical
realism.\" \"Ethical realism,\" according to Lieven and Hulsman (2006:
62-83), \"is therefore of universal and eternal value for the conduct of
international affairs, and especially useful as a guiding philosophy for
the United States and its war on terror.\"

As a representative of the community overall, [[**the government
official has a primary obligation to the national interest**, and, in
particular, the security and integrity of the
state]{.underline}]{.mark}. The ethics of \"humility\" and \"prudence\"
can help to protect the security of the state. However, [the necessities
of national existence cannot be sorted out through an ethical lens of
right and wrong conduct]{.underline}. Effective statecraft demands that
officials act to protect the whole, even if individual and collective
moral principles are sacrificed. **[[The government official must
protect the interests of the community above all
else.]{.underline}]{.mark}** As [a result, according to international
relations theorist Hans Morgenthau (1979: 13), [there is a \"difference
in the moral principles that apply to the private citizen in his
relations with other private citizens and to the public figure in
dealing with other public figures]{.mark}.]{.underline}\" Many of these
\"political realists\" and/or \"ethical realists\" seem to embrace
Machiavelli's division of morality between the public and private
worlds.

## Permutations

#### The affirmative can't access the permutation---the underlying securitization of the affirmatives impact leaves militarism to sustain itself in new grotesque forms within society

Anna **Stavrianakis 13**, Lecturer in International Relations at the
University of Sussex, "Militarism and International Relations",
Dec-12-13, <https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9780203101476>

[[A]{.mark} third [major]{.mark} [reason]{.mark} [why militarism]{.mark}
[currently]{.mark} [receives]{.mark} such [little attention within IR
lies]{.mark}, we suggest, [in]{.mark} the discipline's predominant
concerns with 'security' and more recently
'[securitization']{.mark}]{.underline}. Since 1945, with [the
establishment of [the UN Security Council]{.mark}, [the]{.mark}
[de-legitimization of wars]{.mark} of aggression, [and]{.mark} the
shifting fortunes of ministries of war, defence and security, [the
**concept of 'security' has**]{.mark} **gradually [become]{.mark} the
[central]{.mark}** organizing concept for both the practice and the
study of international affairs]{.underline} (Buzan and Hansen, 2009;
Neocleous, 2000). Moreover, [since the end of the Cold War,
[discourse]{.mark} on 'security' has]{.underline} 10  A. Stavrianakis
and J. Selby been [[significantly]{.mark} [extended]{.mark}
[beyond]{.mark} a concern with the territorial [defence]{.mark} of the
nation-state -- with new referents such as human, global and
environmental security]{.underline} (e.g. Kaldor, 2007a; Tickner, 1992;
Dalby, 2002), [[and]{.mark} a [range]{.mark} of emergent issues [such as
migration, trafficking, disease,]{.mark} health and minorities becoming
significant new focuses of policy intervention and analysis]{.underline}
(e.g. Neal, 2009; Lobasz, 2009; Elbe, 2010; Jutila, 2006). Critical IR
scholarship on security, in turn, has attended above all to the ways in
which claimed '[security **[threats']{.mark} [are]{.mark} framed,
[constructed]{.mark}, 'securitized', and [as a result]{.mark} elevated
above [normal democratic politics]{.mark}**, to politically problematic
or at best ambiguous effect]{.underline}. If 'militarism' was a key
concept and critical tool during the darkest periods of the Cold War,
its parallel today, at least in European IR, is 'securitization' (Buzan
et al., 1998; Balzacq, 2010; Wæver, 1995; Williams, 2003). [With this
[transform]{.mark}ation in [discourse]{.mark} has come a change in the
objects of critique -- away from a core concern [with]{.mark} the
[excessive influence of arms, and military institutions and
ideologies]{.mark}, on domestic and international politics, to a broader
concern with the practice and legitimization of exceptional 'security'
measures, regardless of whether these be the work of the military, or
instead of intelligence services, domestic law enforcement agencies, the
media, or any number of state, private sector and international
'securitizing actors'.]{.underline} Implicitly and sometimes explicitly,
[this [securitization]{.mark} research ['\[q\]uestion\[s]{.mark}\] the
primacy of [the military element and the state]{.mark} in the
conceptualization of security']{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998: 1).
Viewed thus, the traditional IR problematique of military power and
violence has been displaced not only by the problem of failed states,
but also by the problematique of security (Bernazzoli and Flint, 2010).

[[this contribution **should not be easily
discarded**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Perm do both\-\-\--only combining academic normative criticisms and empirical validation in international relations theory can create a solid alternative

Richard **Price 2008**, Professor of international relations at Cornell
University, 2008-09, "Moral Limit and Possibility in World Politics",
https://www.jstor.org/stable/40071865

[[While]{.mark} empirical research and **[IR theory may not be able to
escape normative theorizing, neither]{.mark}**,]{.underline} I would
contend, [**[can]{.mark} [normative theorizing escape]{.mark}** some
degree of **[empirical descriptivism]{.mark}**]{.underline} and even
explanation altogether - a side of the equation that many works of
normative and critical IR theory do not examine systematically, thus
limiting such work from offering all it otherwise could for the
questions that animate this project about moral limit and possibility.
This leaves many normative IR theories undergirded with a postpositivist
epistemology in a bind. Acceptance of Frost\'s constitutive theory
requires that one agrees with the descriptive list of norms he proposes
as \"settled\" norms of world politics that pro- vide the common domain
of discourse upon which the search for normative solutions may proceed.
But these in turn are even less guaranteed on Frost\'s own terms since
in Frost\'s view, description depends on the normative premises the
analyst brings to the table. Frost argues that \"there is no objective
way of choosing between paradigms.\"15 His invocation of a strong
interpretivist epistemology obscures the degree to which normative
claims do in fact depend in various ways on empirical assumptions or
claims about the world nonetheless, even if they cannot be established
as objectively true in a positivist sense. Yet, no criteria are spelled
out to defend those empirical elements - they are either arbitrary or
simply reduced to purely ethical claims. Beitz, in contrast, attempts to
harness the ontological grounds of interdependence (as opposed to
Frost\'s statism) as grounds for a cosmopolitan theory, to cite but one
of a large number of alternative international ethical positions
underpinned by rival empirical grounds.16

[It is here, then, where the kinds of [empirical
validation]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} including that notably
practiced by constructivists among others, [[could help adjudicate
between ethical accounts]{.mark}, at least [forestalling premature
descent into an endless relativist circle of ethical
interpretation]{.mark} without hope of discrimination]{.underline}.17
[Engaging seriously with mainstream methodological concerns even as many
of them embrace a postpositivist epistemology, many [constructivist
scholars make claims]{.mark} [about the]{.mark} (contingent) [validity
of interpretations]{.mark} or explanations, [established]{.mark} in good
part [by demonstrating the inadequacy of alternative
account]{.mark}s]{.underline}. [Constructivist scholarship]{.underline},
often attuned to postpositivist sensibilities even as it has sought to
engage in explanation, [has thereby provided ways to unpack the
dichotomy between relativism and universal objectivism, [**establishing
an epistemological halfway-house** by way of]{.mark} the practice of
[thoroughly adjudicating]{.mark} between [alternative
accounts]{.mark}]{.underline} to remove error where accounts in fact
directly compete with one another, or showing how putative rival
explanations may in fact complement one another. [[This produces a
measure of plausibility to the empirical claims implicit in ethical
theorizing]{.mark} at least one degree **[removed from the arbitrariness
of incommensurable ethics]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and instead offers
contingent claims that can at least identify errors, if not establish
timeless objective truths. [The contention here is that it is these
kinds of [close empirical analyses and the epistemological status of the
claims]{.mark}]{.underline} characteristic of constructivist approaches
to IR that [[can fill in some of the gaps]{.mark} in]{.underline} the
otherwise fruitful beginnings charted out by scholars such as Frost and
Linklater\'s [assessments of moral limit and possibility in world
politics]{.underline}. In addition to its other proclaimed
bridge-building capacities, then, constructivism offers a way to think
through the normative-empirical gap, thereby offering an avenue for
grounding ethical claims in an additionally rigorous wav.18

[The method of closely weighing alternatives against one
another]{.underline} characteristic of many constructivist accounts
[points as well to the importance of alternatives that did not
happen]{.underline} when considering moral possibility. [[This
**intimate relation between empirical explanation and normative
possibility** thus counsels close attention]{.mark} not just [to the
empirical grounds underpinning normative positions]{.mark}, but
specifically to the kinds of counterfactual grounds invoked or, more
often, implied but not explicitly established in claims about ethical
possibility.]{.underline} To impugn, for example, humanitarian
intervention such as that in Kosovo, or the criminal tribunals such as
the one for the former Yugoslavia, typically the event is implicitly
compared to some ideal (presumably an intervention in which state
interests are not involved and few, if any, are killed) in light of
which that which was actually possible is found wanting. Yet the
preferable grounds to regard that ideal as even

standard social science methods such as judging arguments by logical
consistency and ability to explain or predict, see Snyder 2003.

a remote possibility, let alone politically plausible, is often not
persuasively and rigorously established, and it is hardly self-evident
that it [is ethically superior to counsel a course of action that one

cannot]{.mark}**]{.underline}

necessary path toward a synthesis of normative and empirical
approaches]{.underline}. Many empirical approaches can lend their
support here; constructivism\'s particular niche, for its part, would
lie less in pro- viding leverage in deterministic causal accounts than
in its provision of \"conditions of possibility\" types of arguments.

### Perm do the aff through the lens of the K

Masculinity and militarization

Since Enloe's claim that "[[making women invisible hides the workings of
both femininity and masculinity in international
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}" (1989, 11), mas- culinity has been a key,
though until recently understudied, theme in FST (Zalewski and Parpart
1998; Hooper 2001). [[Arguing in favor of granting female agency rather
than succumbing to the perception of women as "victims or
problem]{.underline}s"]{.mark} (1992, 142), Tickner's critique draws on
the work

of Robert Connell to focus on "hegemonic masculinities," not essential-
ized men, and [[she recommends that we take inspiration from feminine
characteristics rather than holding them as markers of female moral
superiority]{.underline}]{.mark} (Tickner 1992, 137). For Connell, these
"configurations of gen- der practice" represent "the currently accepted
answer to the problem of the legitimacy of patriarchy" and thus are a
mutable, "historically mobile relation" (1995, 77). As Charlotte Hooper
has observed, taking into account the male dominance of the field, [[IR
"seems a particularly appropriate site for an investigation into
masculinities, and particularly into their dominant, or 'hegemonic,'
forms]{.underline}]{.mark}" (2001, 5). To this end, Craig Murphy (1998)
catalogs several different types of masculinity in international pol-
itics: the good soldier, the civilian strategist, the military son, the
good comrade, the fashionable pacifist, and the Sisyphean peacemaker.
For Murphy, these hierarchically ordered but interacting subordinate
masculine roles support the dominant "good soldier" role that in turn
buttresses the inequitable world social order.

Applied to IR, [[the study of masculinities offers insights into the
practices that sustain security]{.underline}]{.mark}. Connell argues
that relationships between different masculine types are the basis for
military organization: "physically violent but subordinate to orders on
the one hand, dominating and organizationally competent on the other"
(1985, 9). [[The U.S. military in the 1940s developed technological
advances in nuclear weapons and logistics that increased the importance
of a certain masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark}---"the pro- fessionalized,
calculative rationality of the technical specialist" (Connell 1985, 9).
Originally understood as feminine due to the "sedentary" nature of
"keyboard work," information technology has taken on a meaning with more
power for middle-class men as a result of personal computer marketing
campaigns and violent games (Connell 1995, 55--56). According to Steve
Niva, the 1991 Gulf [[War gave rise to a new iteration of hegemonic
military masculinity, "tough and highly militarized but also sensitive
and compassionate,]{.underline}]{.mark}" counterposed to the type of
masculinity represented by Saddam Hussein (1998, 119). Niva notes that
media coverage of this newly hegemonic masculinity focused on "computer
programmers, missile technologists, battle-tank commanders, high-tech
pilots, and those appropriately equipped and educated for new world
order warfare" at the expense of grunts and foot soldiers, thereby
accentuating the American technological and societal superiority (119).
The U.S. "military's new 'technowar' paradigm for capital-intensive,
high-technology warfare high- lighted the differences between economies
and political systems and, thus, the superiority of Western men over
other men" (119). [[Enloe asks whether UN peacekeeping forces evoke
different, less militaristic masculinities than those who soldier for
the nation-state]{.mark}]{.underline} (1993). [I[n terms of structural
violence, Connell sees a threat in the rising hegemony of a
"transnational business masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark}" exemplified by
globally operating business executives and their network of political
and military contacts (2000, 26).

The study of IR masculinities is accompanied, as Zalewski notes, by the
danger that a concentration on gender "could all too easily focus on men
or masculinity and create the belief that all are equally oppressed and
disadvantaged by gender" and "make invisible the actual practices of
domination" to the detriment of feminist politics (1994, 409). However,
the alternative, to take masculinity as undifferentiated and
unproblematic and to continue to see the oppressive position of
masculinity as inevitable and immutable, makes continued research in
this direction seem worth the risk.

Conclusion

[[Feminists working on security issues have articulated a normative "re-
vision" of what security could mean if gender were to be taken
seriously]{.underline}]{.mark}. Feminist security theory interrogates
the philosophical, academic, and political underpinnings of gendered
insecurity and articulates an alter- native vision of security. [[This
vision entails revealing gendered hierarchies, eradicating patriarchal
structural violence, and working toward the even- tual achievement of
common security]{.underline}.]{.mark} In its critique of existing
theory, FST takes on realism, revealing its philosophically transmuted
gender bias and androcentric framework. [[Reconceptualizing core
concepts of IR,]{.mark} FST expands and contests realist notions of
security and [demonstrates why impoverished assumptions of
autonomy]{.mark} and overly parsimonious levels- of-analysis approaches
must be abandoned for a vision of an interconnected, interdependent
international system. [Feminist investigations of the gendered peace/war
nexus have resulted in the expansion of empirical knowledge,
contributing to a fuller account of]{.mark} women peace workers, women
warriors, wartime sexual violence, [and militarized
masculinities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recent international developments
suggest several more unexplored avenues for future FST research.

Shift 2: Challenging, Transforming, and Eliminating Violent Militarized
Power Relations and Militarization

[Militarism as a way of thought and the militarization of societies,
such that **[perceived threats are likely to be met with weaponry rather
than words]{.mark}**, is [a **root cause** of conflict]{.mark} and
**violent conflict** (WILPF 2015:1). This is because [militarism and
cultures of militarized masculinities create]{.mark} and sustain
political decision-making whereby resorting to [the use of force becomes
a **normalized**]{.mark} mode for dispute resolution (Global Study 2015:
207). As the UN Advisory Group of Experts explained, while militarized
[response]{.mark}s can be effective in the immediate context of halting
violence, [they tend to]{.mark} **[address symptoms rather than root
causes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} \"The very nature of such responses, with
their emphasis on short term security, can sometimes reduce support and
detract attention from achieving sustainable peace\" (UN Advisory Group
2015: 46).

[[**Challenging militarism** is]{.mark} therefore a [key]{.mark}
strategy [to **prevent conflict and sustain peace**]{.mark}. None of the
eight Security Council resolutions on Women, Peace, and Security call
for dis-armament. This is notwithstanding the reality that [**conflict
prevention** cannot take place without **disarmament**]{.mark} and the
references to disarmament in the Charter of the United Nations
(including the obligation of the Security Council to promote the
establishment and maintenance of international peace and security \"with
the least diversion for armaments of the world\'s human and economic
resources\").4]{.underline}

**[[The]{.mark} 2013 Arms Trade Treaty ([ATT) makes it mandatory]{.mark}
for arms exporting states [to]{.mark} [assess]{.mark} the risk that
their weapons will be used to commit or facilitate [serious acts of
gender-based violence]{.mark} or serious acts of violence against women
and children and to deny authoriza-tion of any sales that present such a
risk.]{.underline}**5 It was only due to the interventions of WILPF,
which galvanized other local and international NGOs to advocate for the
gendered impact of weaponry, that such language was included.

[**The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (the
CEDAW Committee)** has followed up on this ATT provision in General
Recommendation 3o on women in conflict prevention, conflict, and
post-conflict.]{.underline} [After referring to [the]{.mark} direct and
[indirect impact of the proliferation of conventional weapons on women
as victims of conflict-related gender-based violence]{.mark}, as victims
of domestic violence, and also as protestors or actors in resistance
movements,6 the Committee recommends state parties address the gendered
impact of international transfers of arms, [especially small and
il-licit arms including through the **ratification and implementation**
of the **ATT**]{.mark}.7 However, while the references to gender-based
violence and violence against women and children represent an important
step forward in the recognition of the gendered impact of the
proliferation and use of arms, we are still confronted by the overall
objective of the ATT, which is to **prevent and eradicate** the illicit
trade in conventional arms and not to prevent and eradicate the transfer
of arms per se (on this point see chapter 54 in this
volume).]{.underline}

Given its founding principle as a peace organization---to save
\"succeeding generations from the scourge of war\"---the United Nations,
led by the new Secretary-General, should more robustly and visibly
promote disarmament as a central strategy to prevent conflict. In his
first public pronouncement on the need to prioritize prevention, the
Secretary-General called for a \"surge in diplomacy for peace\" as a
means of preventive action. [Though recognizing that \"war is never
inevitable. It is always a matter of choice: the choice to exclude, to
discriminate, to marginalize, to resort to violence the
Secretary-General has, to date, been disappointingly silent on the need
for disarmament (Guterres 2017). It is critical that the
Secretary-General take firm unequivocal steps to reframe the ongoing
\"prevention\" debate; beyond elaboration of early warning measures and
increased public and private mediation, the Secretary-General must---and
must be seen to---advocate ro-bustly for a world without weapons.

conflict if the universal calls for **conflict prevention** are to make

#### The ATT supplements humanitarian obligations against nation states\-\--rising cognitive norms and regulations are consistent with humanitarianism

[With regard to States' obligations under international humanitarian law
and international criminal law, [the ATT imposes]{.mark} an additional
and complementary form of **[legal responsibility, consistent with
existing international legal obligations]{.mark}** [deriving]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} treaty and [customary]{.mark} international [law]{.mark}.
**[Article 6.3]{.mark} [supplements]{.mark} existing [obligations
of]{.mark} international [humanitarian law]{.mark} and international
criminal law [by linking]{.mark} directly [the commission of
violations]{.mark} of international humanitarian law [to the transfer of
arms]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Thus, a transit State Party that permits a
transfer of covered items that falls within the ambit of Article 6.3 has
more than just secondary responsibility as a complicit party under
Article 16 of the Articles of State Responsibility and more
responsibility than discharging its due diligence obligation under the
Genocide Convention: the transit State commits a direct violation of a
primary rule of international law under the ATT.

Accordingly, for States Parties to the ATT, [the]{.mark} obligations
under Article 6.3 must take priority over the right of innocent passage.
[Firstly, [Article]{.mark} 6.3 prevails as a matter of law because, in
comparison to the right of innocent passage, Article 6.3 of the ATT
[is]{.mark} the **[more specialised and more]{.mark} recently
[developed]{.mark} legal obligation** and it contains an absolute
prohibition **not to authorize** a transfer in circumstances where the
authorizing State has the requisite knowledge. Secondly, the
[obligations]{.mark} in Article 6.3 clearly [support]{.mark} and
supplement existing [prohibitions]{.mark} in international law
[that]{.mark} [rise]{.mark} to the level of jus [cogens norms and which
are of a higher normative force than the right of innocent
passage]{.mark}. Thirdly, passage that is contrary to Article 6.3 on the
basis of knowledge of those circumstances is clearly 'non-innocent'
within the meaning of Article 19 of UNCLOS. Thus, with regard to the
Mountainville-flagged vessel, as a State Party to [the]{.mark}
[ATT]{.mark}, Islandia [would be under]{.mark} an obl[igation **to
regulate and prevent** passage of that vessel]{.mark} [if]{.mark}
Islandia had [knowledge]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} [items]{.mark} aboard
[would be used to **commit genocide, crimes against humanity or certain

#### R2P allows intervention to stop genocidal conflicts\-\--three empirical examples

[[Three recent conflicts that]{.mark}, at least on paper, [are amenable
to an R2P style intervention: The Yazidis in Iraq, Rohingya Muslims in
Burma]{.mark} (Myanmar), [and Libyans in Benghazi]{.mark} (circa 2011).
Let us examine each of these humanitarian crises in turn]{.underline}.

On June 29, 2014 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-appointed leader of the
so- called Islamic State (ISIS) declared its seized territories in Iraq
and Syria a caliphate.31 ISIS is a Salafi -- ultra-conservative Sunni
Islamic movement -- whose near term goal is to establish a sovereign
territory in the Levant region of the Middle East. As an
ultra-conservative militant organization, ISIS has singled out the
ethnic and religious minority group Yazidis in Iraq as "devil
worshippers" for persecution.32 The Yazidis, numbering less than one
million people, largely reside in northern Iraq.33 The Yazidis practice
an amalgamation of various religious traditions of Christianity and
Islam. The Yazidis have faced many genocidal massacres in their history,
including at least 72 separate pogroms under the Ottoman Empire in the
18th and 19th centuries alone.34 Given their long running
marginalization in the region and ISIS's quick seizure of land, the
Yazidis became a prime target for extermination in 2014-2015.

Within six weeks of declaring its caliphate, ISIS attacked the northern
Iraqi town on Sinjar, home too many Yazidis in the region, and forced
approximately 30,000 to flee into the Sinjar Mountains. At the time of
this attack, the United States had yet to form The Global Coalition to
Defeat ISIS and US president Barack Obama declared, "As commander in
chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting
another war in Iraq."35 Though ultimately an inaccurate statement, Obama
authorized "targeted airstrikes" by US air force assets against ISIS
positions in Iraq to protect both US personnel and "prevent potential
genocide of minority groups."36 Within several weeks of this targeted
intervention by US, Iraqi, and Kurdish forces, [t[he US would officially
announce its coalition to combat ISIS and significantly ramped up its
intervention force in the region]{.mark}]{.underline} -- which remains
in the region today. [[**This limited action by US and allied forces is
considered a "light" R2P intervention** given the justification for
action.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The second conflict amenable to an R2P intervention is Burma (Myanmar's)
present-day genocidal campaign against Rohingya Muslims. Though
unrecognized by Burma's government, the Rohingya have resided in western
Burma since the precolonial era.37 In 2012 and 2016, communal violence
broke out across Rakhine state, a western province home to most Rohingya
Muslims. Though initially perpetrated by local political entrepreneurs,
"the subsequent military operation saw over a thousand homes burnt to
the ground, as well as allegations of rape perpetrated by Burmese forces
against Rohingya civilians."38 For years, Muslims in Burma have faced
widespread societal discrimination, with many innocent Islamic
practitioners often inappropriately compared to ISIS or al-Qaeda
militant organizations.39

In many ways the Tatmadaw, Burmese Armed Forces, have followed a long
held process of genocide preparation. Burmese officials ordered the
confiscation of "sharp and blunt objects" that could be used for
protection by Rohingya civilians, then trained and armed local
non-Rohingya civilians, deprived the Rohingya of food and other aid,
systematically built-up Tatmadaw security and military personnel in the
western regions, and finally order the looting, burning of villages,
rape, forced relocation, and widespread murder of Rohingya Muslims.40
Since the government-led "clearance operations" began, more than 700,000
Rohingya have been forced from their homes and have sought refuge in
Bangladesh.41 The evidence is clear, Burma's Tatmadaw continue to
commit, enact, prescribe, coerce, mastermind, or otherwise engage in
humanity's most abominable crime -- genocide. In November 2017, former
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called the situation "ethnic
cleansing." As of December 2017, Médecins Sans Frontières has estimated
that at least 9,400 Rohingya have died, among which 6,700 died from
violence, shootings, torture, rape, or immolation, and another 647,000
have fled to neighboring Bangladesh (now more than 700,000). It is
important to note, it is likely that these figures underestimate the
true cost and violence perpetrated against the Rohingya -- due to the
enormous difficulty in counting civilian causalities in authoritarian
states. Given the enormity of the situation, [[Burma is ripe for an R2P
humanitarian military intervention to protect the lives, dignity, and
cultural heritage of Rohingya Muslims. Yet none has taken
place]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Finally, [[the third humanitarian crisis, which embodies the spirit of
R2P, is the US-led humanitarian military intervention in
Libya]{.underline}]{.mark} (circa 2011). On March 17, 2011, the UN
Security Council (UNSC) approved Resolution 1973, which authorized
military intervention in Libya to protect civilians and civilian-
populated areas from attack. "The goal, Obama explained, was to save the
lives of peaceful, pro-democracy protesters who found themselves the
target of a crackdown by Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi."42 This
intervention is often lauded as the quintessential R2P example, and in
some respects, it is. The international community, led in this case by
western powers, advocated for the protection of civilians in eastern
Libya who were specifically targeted for mass murder by the regime.
Within hours of the UNSC Resolution's passage, a multi-state NATO-led
coalition began bombarding regime units on their way toward Benghazi.
**[[This humanitarian military intervention is largely credited with
saving the lives of civilians located in eastern
Libya]{.underline}]{.mark}**, principally the city of Benghazi. Despite
initial success of the R2P-style intervention, the Libyan model poses
some risks. First, R2P does not establish a uniform timetable for
withdrawal. As such, the NATO-led coalition was successful in routing
Libyan troops from exterminating civilians in the east; however, the
intervention lacked any long-term follow through in creating a stable
governing regime. Though initiated under the auspices of good
intentions, it is possible that the second order effects of the 2011
intervention outweigh the short-term benefits.

Conclusion

One lesson learned from the Holocaust and articulated by A. Dirk Moses
in 2011, was one significant problem remains, particularly in
contemporary Western societies, that the Holocaust is still portrayed as
"the epitome of evil." Therefore, if mass violence does not mimic the
signs and symptoms of the Holocaust it can be excluded as
non-genocidal[. [Despite much advancement in international law]{.mark},
technology, and human rights [during the twentieth century as many as
350 million people were intentionally killed by governments or organized
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}.43 The 1948 Genocide Convention was an
attempt to eliminate the scourge of genocide from human experience. The
convention establishes two mandates: The prevention and punishment of
the crime of genocide. The former has gone unfilled. [[The international
community has had **greater progress with punishing the crime of
genocide**]{.mark}, though much work remains, [but **prevention of this
extreme violence has eluded the international community for decades**.
With **the creation of the R2P doctrine**]{.mark} in the early 2000s,
**[the international community has established a better prevention and
intervention mechanism]{.mark}** for states and regional organizations
**[to employ in times of great human suffering and
genocide]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### R2P is good\-\--it represents rebuilding rather than intervention\-\--consent of the nation state is needed, and bottom up civilian focuses come first

The Practice of RtoP

[[The practice of RtoP has been **crucial in assuring the skeptics who
fear neoimperialism**]{.underline}]{.mark} and in winning support for
the UN from those who seek stronger protections for human rights.

[[The first test the UN passed was, ironically,]{.mark} passed [by not
acting]{.mark}]{.underline}, not acting to intervene in Myanmar to
rescue the population from the effects of Cyclone Nargis in May, 2008.
After the hurricane struck and when news of the government\'s
inability/unwillingness to deal with the disaster circulated, French
foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner and former Australian foreign minister
Gareth Evans, two originators of the RtoP concept called for action,
with Evans commenting: \"But when a government default is as grave as
the course on which the Burmese generals now seem to be set, there is at
least a prima facie case to answer for their intransigence being a crime
against humanity---of a kind which would attract the responsibility to
protect principle \" (Evans 2008). Evans himself soon changed his mind
and cooler heads in the UN Security Council and the Secretariat
prevailed. [[Widespread loss of life and government incapacity to
rescue]{.mark}---both of which were manifest---[were not the triggers
for RtoP]{.mark} and to treat them as such would have undermined the
thin support RtoP had achieved]{.underline} at the 2005 Summit. \"Crimes
against humanity\", the closest potential trigger, included as listed in
Article 7 of the Rome Statute, murder, extermination enslavement and
other crimes evidencing \"widespread or systematic attacks on the
civilian population \... part of government policy. A consistent
plan.\"(ICC Treaty) The loss of life appeared to be widespread but there
was not evidence of mens rea \"policy\" designed to deprive parts of the
population of the means of life. Eventually regional diplomacy secured
access, too late for many victims but late enough to permit slow-moving
regional diplomacy to work, and thus to preserve the thin political
coalition behind RtoP. Kenya in 2008 and Guinea in 2009 were crises
shaped by RtoP---but implicitly, not explicidy. [[This indeed might be
the doctrines strongest claim**: it provides an option whose mere
existence encourages consensual resolutions of
crises**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Kenya, former UN chief Kofi Annan,
former Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa, and Graca Michel, wife of
former South African president Nelson Mandela, served as mediation team
to halt ethnic killing sparked by the widely contested reelection of
President Mwai Kibaki, in which opposition leader Raila Odinga claimed
to have been robbed of victory. Approximately 800 people were killed,
and some 260,000 others displaced across the country, in a wave of
deadly rioting and ethnic killings. Kouchner again invoked the specific
language of RtoP. (Kouchner 2008). Annan, however, while later
acknowledging that he \"saw the crisis in the R2P prism with the Kenyan
government unable to contain the situation or protect the people\...\",
did not use that language directly with the Kenyan government.13 He did
not need to. Governments in Africa, Europe, and the United States were
sending the same message of concern, backing that up with cuts or
threatened cuts in government foreign aid (humanitarian aid continued)
Moreover, the leadership in Kenya knew that RtoP was now part of the SC
arsenal, available if their intransigence provoked sufficient
international will to invoke it (Lindenmayer and Kaye 2009; Weiss 2010).
The September 2009 crisis in Guinea involved coup-leader Captain Dadis
Camara\'s troops rioting against a peaceful demonstration. The
international community mobilized again. SG Ban Ki-moon condemned the
violence and set up a UN Commission of Inquiry. The commission report
raised the possibility that \"crimes against humanity\" were committed
by Camara\'s troops. The United States and the EU suspended economic
assistance. Camara was attacked by one of his own officers (whom Camara
may have planned to be the scapegoat) and fled the country for medical
assistance. An interim government initiated steps toward a democratic
election with international support (Anderson 2010; Global Centre for
the Responsibility to Protect 2010).14

Implications for Law and Ethics

[[The UN Charter is a \"living constitution,\" and the UN members are
nothing if not fluid in their commitments]{.mark}. So [RtoP continues to
evolve. The Security Council reaffirmed RtoP]{.mark}]{.underline} in SC
Resl674 (S/Res/1674 2006) [[and]{.mark} operationally [made the
protection of civilians in ongoing peace operations an important
commitment]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Secretary-General presented a
valuable report (\"Implementing the Responsibility to Protect\" 12
January, 2009, A/63/677) [outlining all that [the UN]{.mark} could and
[should]{.mark} do to [help]{.mark} prevent and [rebuild with the
consent of the affected state. **The report by emphasizing prevention
and rebuilding rather than intervention**]{.mark} thereby further
[**distanced RtoP from simply another license to intervene**
militarily]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the summer of 2009, the General
Assembly considered the SG\'s report and RtoP more generally at a
special meeting organized by GA president and strong RtoP critic Miguel
d\"Escoto-Brockmann (former Sandinista commandante and Nicaraguan
foreign minister). Highlighted by an invitation to Professor Noam
Chomsky to address the General Assembly, the session in
D\'Escoto-Brockmann\'s plan was designed to roast the doctrine. Instead,
a considerable majority of states---North and South---reaffirmed their
commitment.

Many also warned of abuses that might follow from it. Only a handful
(Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba, and a few others) outright rejected the
commitment made in 2005. Nonetheless, when it came to a consensus
endorsement of the SG\'s Report, the best that could be achieved was a
tepid \"takes note\" (Dept. of Public Information 2009). From the
standpoint of international law, the doctrine and practice of RtoP was
not legislative---not equivalent to either a Charter amendment of
Chapter

VII or an international treaty. But it was part of an ongoing process
bending the meaning of \"international threats to the peace\" as defined
by the Council under Chapter VII. The Security Council has a long record
of acting on the basis of Chapter VII against perceived \"threats to the
peace\" that more than stretched the meaning of international attacks.
For instance, the Council imposed obligatory sanctions on Rhodesia
(1966) and South Africa (1977), citing with regard to the obligatory
arms embargo imposed on South Africa---in effect an arms
blockade---South Africa\'s \"massive violence\" against its own
population, its "military build-up,\" and its past record of
\"persistent acts of aggression\" against its neighboring states.15
Drawing up a list just three years into the expansion of Council
activity that characterized the post-Cold War period, Lori Damrosch has
identified a wide range of other triggers for successful Chapter VTI
determinations of threats against the peace, including genocide, ethnic
cleansing, and war crimes (Former Republic of Yugoslavia, Iraq,
Liberia); interference with the delivery of humanitarian supplies
(Former Republic of Yugoslavia, Iraq, Somalia); violations of
cease-fires (Former Republic of Yugoslavia, Liberia, Cambodia); collapse
of civil order (Liberia, Somalia); and coups against democratic
governments (Haiti) (Damrosch 1993:10-14). RtoP both informally endorses
a reading of Article 39 \"international\" beyond international attacks
and yet restricts the even wider reading that the Council had exercised
during the 1990s. [While far from settled, [RtoP is beginning to build
the record of general practice supplementing the sense of obligation
that builds customary international law]{.mark}]{.underline}. RtoP does
not quite qualify as opinio juris vel necessitatis---acting on the basis
of legal obligation---[[but the use of \"responsibility\" language is
approaching that normative strength]{.underline}.]{.mark}1\'1 In this
light, it is worth recalling that Security Council action during the
Rwandan genocide was in part stymied by claims from Rwanda and its few
supporters on the Council that the crisis was a domestic issue, not one
subject to legitimate international authority.17 R2p could not claim
clear legality, but it could claim legitimacy after the 2005 Summit
Outcome. Indeed and ironically, th[e [increasing power of the norm is
reflected in the way in which the United States invoked humanitarian
concerns generally]{.mark}]{.underline} and Russia R2P explicitly to try
to justify their interventions in Iraq (2003) and Georgia (2008). This
has implications for international ethics. Realists will need to
acknowledge that RtoP is becoming part of what constitutes the
conventional standards of stabilizing behavior---reputational standards
that should be overridden only when significant security interests are
at stake. Socialists, while challenging borders in the name of class
solidarity, will also need to acknowledge that there is a new floor and
standard for acceptable national policy. Clearly, RtoP is most
consequential for Liberals. [On its face, [it **defines and limits what
is acceptable communitarian standards from an international point of
view**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It also operates against the cosmopolitan
conception of utilitarian calculus, where every harm counts as one and
the sum of harms (including preventable starvation, for example) rather
that the kind (RtoP\'s four elements) counts the most. We should not
assume that it will resolve these debates in moral philosophy. [[Much of
the value of philosophically ethical thinking is that it constantly
questions received standards in the name of security, solidarity, and
human dignity and human welfare.]{.underline}]{.mark} And RtoP should
not be immune from this critique.

### AT: Intervention

#### Interventionism is unpopular amount the public\-\-- the aff isn't a direct intervention like Iraq rather one that simply stops selling arms to deemed risky countries 

Clare **Malone 17 ,** Senior Political Writer, "America's Fickle
Relationship with Humanitarian Intervention," 4-10-17,
<https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-fickle-relationship-with-humanitarian-intervention/>

[The purpose of President [Trump's]{.mark} [airstrikes]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} a [Syria]{.mark}n government airfield [was]{.mark},
according to Trump, [to secure the national security]{.mark} interests
of the U.S. "[and]{.mark} [deter]{.mark} the spread and use of deadly
[chemical weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

But [[there]{.mark} [were]{.mark} apparently other, more [humanitarian
considerations]{.mark} for the president]{.underline}. He opened his
televised remarks on Thursday with a statement about the lives that had
been lost in the sarin gas attack and the cruel nature of their deaths:
"It was a slow and brutal death for so many, even beautiful babies were
cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should
ever suffer such horror." [Trump was clearly moved to action by the
horror of the attack on civilians, but through the years, American
public opinion has been mixed on the subject of humanitarian grounds for
foreign intervention.]{.underline}

The early polling about Trump's decision to strike suggests there's
broad support for it, but [**[Syrian intervention on humanitarian
grounds hasn't been popular in the past]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In the
fall of 2013, when President Obama sought congressional approval for
military action against Bashar al-Assad's government after it used
chemical weapons on civilians only [36]{.mark} [percent]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [[Americans]{.mark} [favored]{.mark} the U.S. taking
[military]{.mark} [action]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [reduce]{.mark} Syria's
chemical weapons [use]{.mark}. [Fifty-one percent]{.mark} of those
surveyed [opposed]{.mark} military [action]{.mark} on these
grounds.]{.underline} (Obama's effort failed.)

But [the contours of the Syrian crisis changed when the Islamic State
began to operate in the country. Americans' [calculus]{.mark} [appears
to have shifted as well]{.mark}. A poll from last year showed that
[Americans]{.mark} [generally supported limited intervention]{.mark} in
Syria [against extremist groups]{.mark}]{.underline} --- 72 percent were
in favor of airstrikes against them, and 57 percent were in favor of
special operations forces working in the country.

That difference --- [more support for [acting]{.mark} [against]{.mark}
[the Islamic State]{.mark}, an international terror threat, than against
the Assad government's home-turf war crimes --- [speaks to Americans'
**fraught relationship with humanitarian
intervention**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Looking at the last 20 years or so
of American debates over humanitarian intervention in conflict zones
around the world, one sees ebbs and flows in support, reflecting the
varying degrees of success of American missions abroad. (I looked at
public opinion surrounding the conflicts in Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia,
Kosovo and Darfur.)

[[Americans]{.mark} [started]{.mark} [the]{.mark} last [decade]{.mark}
of the 20th century bullish [on]{.mark} American [intervention]{.mark}
in humanitarian crises.]{.underline} President George H.W. Bush
announced he was sending troops into Somalia's civil war and famine in
December 1992, and a Gallup/Newsweek poll that month showed that a
majority of Americans (66 percent) approved of this move. But less than
a year later, in October 1993, 18 Americans soldiers died in the Battle
of Mogadishu while Bill Clinton was president. [[That seemed to **have
serious influence**]{.mark} [on]{.mark} American [opinion]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} humanitarian [intervention]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In June of 1994, in the midst of the three-month killing spree in Rwanda
that would result in the deaths of 800,000 people, [CBS News asked poll
respondents if "in order to stop the killing [in]{.mark}
[Rwanda]{.mark}" they favored or opposed sending in ground troops.
[Sixty]{.mark}-[one]{.mark} [percent]{.mark} [opposed]{.mark} the
effort. When the same poll asked if the "United States has a
[responsibility]{.mark} to do something to stop the killing in Rwanda,"
[51]{.mark} [percent]{.mark} of respondents [said the country did
not]{.mark} have that [moral obligation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This 1990s turn against intervention --- likely with the deaths in
Mogadishu still fresh in Americans' minds --- continued with the Bosnian
war. [[In]{.mark} early [1994]{.mark}, as NATO bombing began and Clinton
declared the U.S. willing to aid in the effort, [Americans]{.mark}
**[still seemed uneasy with]{.mark}** the idea of a [moral
mandate]{.mark}.]{.underline} A Time/CNN poll in February of that year
asked if respondents thought "the United States has a moral obligation
to protect the citizens of Sarajevo and Bosnia." Fifty percent said no.

[The dawn of the new century and the George W. Bush administration of
course changed American foreign policy --- the attacks on Sept. 11,
2001, and [subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan left an American
public **overwhelmed** by overseas conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Perhaps because of this, the killings in the Darfur region of Sudan
resonated less urgently with the public. All this despite the U.S.
Congress formally declaring the killings in the Darfur region of Sudan
to be "genocide" and Bush also calling the Darfur killings "genocide" in
2005. But asked to rank a list of foreign policy priorities in a July
2006 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 7 percent of respondents said
"dealing with the genocide in Darfur" should rank as the U.S.'s No. 1
foreign policy priority. Stabilizing Iraq, fighting the war on
terrorism, and "dealing with China as a growing superpower" were the
primary concerns of the public.

[Trump's Syria intervention comes at a moment when the U.S. is
questioning its role abroad. The president ran on a policy of "America
first," an idea that resonated with many in the public who had soured on
the effects of outsourcing and decades-long conflicts in the Middle
East]{.underline}. Trump himself seemed at times to sneer at the idea
that the U.S. bore a moral obligation unique unto itself; "you think our
country is so innocent?" he said, responding to a question about
Vladimir Putin's penchant for eliminating political opponents. Some have
speculated that his foreign policy will be more isolationist, but the
events of this week cast that into somewhat more doubt.

### Militarism Good Turn

the Greek peninsula. Thereafter, [these historical lessons should have

#### Militarism is key to leadership and preserving order to check those who threaten the world order

David **Brooks 01**, a Canadian-born American political and cultural
commentator who writes for The New York Times, "Age of conflict,"

Obviously nobody knows what the future years will feel like, but we do
know that the next decade will have a central feature that was lacking
in the last one: The next few years will be defined by conflict. And
it\'s possible to speculate about what that means. [[The institutions
that fight for us and defend us against disorder]{.mark} \-- the
military, the FBI, the CIA \-- [will seem more important and more
admirable]{.mark}. The fundamental arguments won\'t be over economic or
social issues, they will be over how to wield power \-- whether to use
American power aggressively or circumspectly. **[We will care a lot more
about ends \-- winning the war \-- than we will about
means.]{.mark}**]{.underline} We will debate whether it is necessary to
torture prisoners who have information about future biological attacks.
We will destroy innocent villages by accident, shrug our shoulders, and
continue fighting. In an age of conflict, bourgeois virtues like
compassion, tolerance, and industriousness are valued less than the
classical virtues of courage, steadfastness, and a ruthless desire for
victory. \[...continues...\] But now violence has come calling. Now it
is no longer possible to live so comfortably in one\'s own private
paradise. [Shocked out of the illusion of self-reliance, most of us
realize that we, as individuals, simply cannot protect ourselves.
**Private life requires public protection.** Now it is not possible to
ignore foreign affairs, because foreign affairs have not ignored us. It
has become clear that we are living in a world in which **hundreds of
millions** of people hate us, and some small percentage of them **want
to destroy us**]{.underline}. That realization is bound to have cultural
effects. In the first place, we will probably become more conscious of
our American-ness. During the blitz in 1940, George Orwell sat in his
bomb shelter and wrote an essay called \"England Your England.\" It
opened with this sentence: \"As I write, highly civilised human beings
are flying overhead, trying to kill me.\" What struck him at that moment
of danger was that it really does matter whether you are English or
German. The nation is a nursemaid that breeds certain values and a
certain ethos. Orwell went on to describe what it meant to be English.
Now Americans are being killed simply because they are Americans. Like
Orwell, Americans are once again becoming aware of themselves as a
nationality, not just as members of some ethnic community or globalized
Internet chat group. Americans have been reminded that, despite what the
multiculturalists have been preaching, [not all cultures are wonderfully
equal hues in the great rainbow of humanity. Some national cultures, the
ones that have inherited certain ideas \-- about freedom and democracy,
the limits of the political claims of religion, the importance of
tolerance and dissent \-- are **more humane** than other civilizations,
which reject those ideas]{.underline}. As criticism of our war effort
grows in Europe, in hostile Arab countries, and in two-faced countries
like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which dislike our principles but love our
dollars, Americans will have to articulate a defense of our national
principles and practices. That debate in itself will shape American
culture. We will begin to see ourselves against the backdrop of the
Taliban. During the Cold War, we saw ourselves in contrast to the Soviet
Union. Back then, we faced a godless foe; now we are facing a god-crazed
foe. As we recoil from the Islamic extremists, we may be less willing to
integrate religion into political life. That would mean trouble for
faith-based initiatives and religion in the public square. On the other
hand, democracies tend to become patriotic during wartime, if history is
any guide, and this will drive an even deeper wedge between regular
Americans and the intellectual class. Literary critic Paul Fussell, a
great student of American culture in times of war, wrote a book,
Wartime, on the cultural effects of World War II. Surveying the culture
of that period, he endorsed the view of historian Eileen Sullivan, who
wrote, \"[There was **no room** in this war culture for **individual
opinions** or personalities, **no freedom of dissent or approval**; the
culture was homogeneous, shallow and boring.\"]{.underline}
\[...continues...\] Don\'t make the mistake of interpreting the events
of Sept. 11 purely in terms of terrorism and murder. . . . The
terrorists are a virulent subset of a much larger group of
anticapitalists, one that includes many politicians, bureaucrats,
writers, media types, academics, entertainers, trade unionists and, at
times, church leaders. The barbarians at the gates are more numerous
than you thought. But the most important cultural effect of conflict is
that it breeds a certain bloody-mindedness or, to put it more grandly, a
tragic view of life. Life in times of war and recession reminds us of
certain hard truths that were easy to ignore during the decade of peace
and prosperity. [[**Evil exists.** Difficulties, even tragedies, are
**inevitable**. Human beings are flawed creatures capable of
monstrosity]{.mark}. Not all cultures are compatible. **[To preserve
order, good people must exercise power over destructive
people.]{.mark}**]{.underline} That means that [it\'s no longer
sufficient to deconstruct ideas and texts and signifiers. You have to be
able to **construct hard principles so you can move from one idea to the
next**, because when you are faced with the problem of repelling evil,
you absolutely must be able to reach a conclusion on serious moral
issues.]{.underline} This means you need to think in moral terms about
force \-- and to be tough-minded. During the Cold War, Reinhold Niebuhr
was a major intellectual figure. In 1952, he wrote The Irony of American
History. The tragedy of the conflict with communism, he argued, was
that, \"though confident of its virtue, [\[America\] must yet hold
atomic bombs ready for use so as to prevent a possible **world
conflagration**]{.underline}.\" The irony of our history, he continued,
is that we are an idealistic nation that dreams of creating a world of
pure virtue, yet in defeating our enemies we sometimes have to act in
ways that are not pure. \"We take, and must continue to take, morally
hazardous action to preserve our civilization,\" Niebuhr wrote. \"**[[We
must exercise our power]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" We have to do so while
realizing that we will not be capable of perfect disinterestedness when
deciding which actions are just. We will be influenced by dark passions.
[[But we still have to **act forcefully** because our enemies are trying
to **destroy** the basis of civilization]{.mark}: \"We are drawn into an
historic situation in which the paradise of our domestic security is
suspended in a **hell of global insecurity**]{.underline}.\" Niebuhr\'s
prescription was humble hawkishness. He believed the United States
should forcefully defend freedom and destroy its enemies. But while
doing so, it should seek forgiveness for the horrible things it might
have to do in a worthy cause. To reach this graduate-school level of
sophistication, you have to have passed through elementary courses in
moral reasoning. It will be interesting to see whether we Americans, who
sometimes seem unsure of even the fundamental moral categories, can
educate ourselves sufficiently to engage in the kind of moral reasoning
that Niebuhr did. The greatest political effect of this period of
conflict will probably be to relegitimize central institutions. Since we
can\'t defend ourselves as individuals against terrorism, we have to
rely on the institutions of government: the armed forces, the FBI, the
CIA, the CDC, and so on. We are now only beginning to surrender some
freedoms, but we will trade in more, and willingly. As Alexander
Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers, \"Safety from external danger
is the most powerful director of national conduct. Even the ardent love
of liberty will, after a time, give way to its dictates. . . . To be
more safe, \[people\] at length become willing to run the risk of being
less free.\" Moreover, we will see power migrate from the states and
Capitol Hill to the White House. \"It is of the nature of war to
increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority,\"
Hamilton continued. This creates rifts on both left and right, because
both movements contain anti-establishment elements hostile to any effort
to relegitimize central authorities. The splits have been most
spectacular on the left. Liberals who work in politics \-- Democrats on
Capitol Hill, liberal activists, academics who are interested in
day-to-day politics \-- almost all support President Bush and the war
effort. But many academic and literary leftists, ranging from Eric Foner
to Susan Sontag to Noam Chomsky, have been sour, critical, and
contemptuous of America\'s response to September 11. The central
difference is that the political liberals are comfortable with power.
They want power themselves and do not object to the central institutions
of government, even the military, exercising power on our behalf. Many
[[literary and academic liberals]{.mark}, on the other hand, have built
a whole moral system around powerlessness.]{.underline} They champion
the outgroups. [They [stand with the victims of hegemony, patriarchy,
colonialism, and all the other manifestations of central authority.
Sitting on their campuses, they are powerless
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and have embraced a delicious,
self-glorifying identity as the out-manned sages who alone can see
through the veils of propaganda in which the powerful hide their
oppressive schemes. For these thinkers, virtue inheres in the powerless.
The weak are sanctified, not least because they are voiceless and
allegedly need academics to give them voices. These outgroup leftists
dislike the Taliban, but to ally themselves with American power would be
to annihilate everything they have stood for and the role they have
assigned themselves in society. \[...continues...\] For Bush, the leader
of the free world, the issue is terrorism, not street crime. But now he
too is engaged in the effort to restore order so that people can go
about their lives. He is the one rounding up the posse, forsaking social
issues and other moral debates for a straightforward act of
international prosecution. He is reasserting authority to show that
under Pax Americana, the world is governable. \[...continues...\] But
history never repeats itself neatly. No one can predict the political
and cultural consequences of a war, any more than the course of the war
itself. But it does seem clear that we have moved out of one political
and cultural moment and into another. We have traded the anxieties of
affluence for the real fears of war. We have moved from an age of peace
to an age of conflict, and in times of conflict people are different.
They go to extremes. Some people, and some nations, turn cowardly or
barbaric. Other people, and other nations, become heroic, brave, and
steadfast. It all depends on what they have in them. War isn\'t only, as
Bourne said, the health of the state. It\'s the gut-check of the nation.

### Securitization Turn

#### New security frameworks and a move away from securitization causes the state to become more interventionist---turns the K

Tara **McCormack, '10**, Lecturer in International Politics at the
University of Leicester, 2010, (Critique, Security and Power: The
political limits to emancipatory approaches, page 127-129)

The following section will briefly raise some questions about the
[rejection of the old security framework]{.underline} as it has been
taken up by the most powerful institutions and states. [Here we can
begin to see the political limits to critical and emancipatory
frameworks]{.underline}. In an international system which is marked by
great power inequalities between states, the [[rejection]{.mark} of
the]{.underline} old narrow national [interest-based security
framework]{.underline} by major international institutions, [and the
adoption of]{.underline} ostensibly [emancipatory policies]{.underline}
and policy rhetoric, [has the consequence of **[problematis]{.mark}ing
[weak]{.mark} or unstable [states]{.mark}** [and allowing]{.mark}
international institutions or [major states **a more interventionary
role**]{.mark}]{.underline}, yet [without establishing mechanisms by
which the citizens of states being intervened in might have any control
over the agents or agencies of their emancipation]{.underline}.
[Whatever the problems associated with the pluralist security framework
**there were at least formal and clear demarcations**]{.underline}.
[[This has the consequence of **entrenching international power
inequalities** and allowing]{.mark} for a shift towards [a hierarchical
international order in which]{.mark} the [citizens in weak]{.mark} or
unstable [states may]{.mark} arguably [have]{.mark} even [less
freedom]{.mark} or power than before]{.underline}. Radical critics of
contemporary security policies, such as human security and humanitarian
intervention, argue that we see an assertion of Western power and the
creation of liberal subjectivities in the developing world. For example,
see Mark Duffield's important and insightful contribution to the ongoing
debates about contemporary international security and development.
Duffield attempts to provide a coherent empirical engagement with, and
theoretical explanation of, these shifts. Whilst these shifts, away from
a focus on state security, and the so-called merging of security and
development are often portrayed as positive and progressive shifts that
have come about because of the end of the Cold War, Duffield argues
convincingly that these shifts are highly problematic and unprogressive.
For example, the rejection of sovereignty as formal international
equality and a presumption of nonintervention has eroded the division
between the international and domestic spheres and led to an
international environment in which Western NGOs and powerful states have
a major role in the governance of third world states. Whilst for
supporters of humanitarian intervention this is a good development,
[Duffield points out the depoliticising implications, drawing on
examples in Mozambique and Afghanistan]{.underline}. [Duffield also
draws out the problems of the retreat from modernisation that is
represented by sustainable development]{.underline}. The Western world
has moved away from the development policies of the Cold War, which
aimed to develop third world states industrially. Duffield describes
this in terms of a new division of human life into uninsured and insured
life. Whilst we in the West are 'insured' -- that is we no longer have
to be entirely self-reliant, we have welfare systems, a modern division
of labour and so on -- sustainable development aims to teach populations
in poor states how to survive in the absence of any of this. [[Third
world populations must be taught to be self-reliant,]{.mark} they will
remain uninsured. Self-reliance of course [means]{.mark} **the
[condemnation of millions to]{.mark}** **[a]{.mark} barbarous [life of
inhuman bare survival]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Ironically,
although sustainable development is celebrated by many on the left
today, by leaving people to fend for themselves rather than developing a
society wide system which can support people, [sustainable development
actually leads to a less human and humane system than that developed in
modern capitalist states]{.underline}. Duffield also describes how many
of these problematic shifts are embodied in the contemporary concept of
human security. For Duffield, [we can understand these shifts in terms
of Foucauldian biopolitical framework]{.underline}, which can be
understood as [a regulatory power that seeks to support life through
intervening in the biological, social and economic processes that
constitute a human population]{.underline} (2007: 16). Sustainable
development and human security are for Duffield technologies of security
which aim to *create* self-managing and self-reliant subjectivities in
the third world, which can then survive in a situation of serious
underdevelopment (or being uninsured as Duffield terms it) without
causing security problems for the developed world. For Duffield this is
all driven by a neoliberal project which seeks to control and manage
uninsured populations globally. Radical critic Costas Douzinas (2007)
also criticises new forms of cosmopolitanism such as human rights and
interventions for human rights as a triumph of American hegemony. Whilst
we are in agreement with critics such as Douzinas and Duffield that
[these [new security frameworks]{.mark} cannot be empowering, and
ultimately [lead to more power for powerful
sta**tes**,]{.mark}]{.underline} we need to understand why these
frameworks have the effect that they do. We can understand that these
frameworks have political limitations without having to look for a
specific plan on the part of current powerful states. In new security
frameworks such as human security we can see the political limits of the
framework proposed by critical and emancipatory theoretical approaches.

### Sovereignty Focus Bad

#### International Law reduces sovereignty BUT critiques of international relations should focus should be on global governance\-\--the alt has the wrong target

**American Society of International Law 13**, Society for promoting the
establishment and maintenance of international relations on the basis of
law and justice, "Closing Plenary: Global Governance, State Sovereignty,
and the Future of International Law", Cambridge University Press,
https://www-jstor-org.turing.library.northwestern.edu/stable/10.5305/procannmeetasil.107.0489

Thank you. It's a great pleasure and honor to join this panel. [I notice
the composition seems to be ''the west and the rest.'']{.underline}
\[Laughter\] I [think the topic is very pertinent to international law
today]{.underline}. I agree with Judge Simma that in the Peace Palace we
don't talk about governance. We talk about states all the time, we talk
about state sovereignty all the time. Whatever school of thought,
whether ''humanity's law'' or ''constitutionalism,'' [[we tend to focus
on the concept of sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Actually, I think
**[international law should focus on global
governance]{.mark}**,]{.underline} but the question is: What do we mean
by global governance? If we mean the international regulation of state
relations, then we are not far from the system now. The very question
touches on the nature of the legal system we are talking about.
Personally, I feel that [[**global governance and state sovereignty are
two sides of the same coin**.]{.underline} [Without either of them,
there would be no international law---or no need for international
law]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is no point in arguing about whether the
Westphalian system is still functioning, whether or not sovereignty
remains a valid notion. From the inception of that system, there has
been no absolute state sovereignty. From day one, [[when states engaged
in relations with each other through law, **they had to give up some of
their sovereignty**.]{.underline} [A result of the
development]{.underline}]{.mark} [of international relations in recent
decades [is the expanding scope of international regulations and]{.mark}
more [restrictions on sovereign rights.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed,
even as ''humanity'' has moved to the center of our attention[, **[it
has not moved to the point where global governance could replace
national governance]{.mark}**, such that we might see the formation of a
world government. We should be careful about using the term
''government'' or ''world government'']{.underline} or ''global
government.'' We can easily confuse the two concepts. When we talk about
sovereignty and global governance, I don't think these binary systems
are mutually exclusive. When you strengthen global governance, it does
not mean state sovereignty necessarily has to be compromised or
weakened. [No state, no matter how strong or weak, is ready to give up
its statehood in exchange for global government]{.underline}. On the
other hand, [no state claims it is not bound by international law. So
[if the international legal community focuses on the diminution of state
sovereignty in thinking about global governance, **it is aiming at the
wrong target.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Legal Decisions Good / Stavrianakis

#### The alt fails\-\--Stavrianakis concludes that ending the sale of arms is good to prevent them from being weaponized in the Middle East\-\--the aff is key to understand the legal decisions that keep the U.S. accountable for its actions

Anna **Stavrianakis** **6/27**/19, Senior Lecturer in International
Relations at the University of Sussex, UK, 6/27/19, "See no evil: How
the UK government tries not to know about bombing civilians in Yemen,"
https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/how-uk-government-tries-not-know-about-civilian-harm-yemen

Last week's landmark decision by the Court of Appeal that UK arms sales
to Saudi Arabia are unlawful brings some much-needed accountability to
the war in Yemen.

[An unmitigated humanitarian disaster has been visited on the country:
more than [91,000 people]{.mark} have been [killed]{.mark},
approximately [11,700]{.mark} of them civilians [killed in targeted
attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Saudi-led coalition and its allies are
responsible for over two-thirds of these civilian deaths.

Tip of the iceberg

[[These deaths are just the tip of the iceberg]{.mark}: the population
has been subjected to famine and cholera through an economic blockade
and attacks on healthcare and infrastructure.]{.underline} Yemen's
cultural heritage has also been directly attacked, as have schools,
weddings and funerals that make up the fabric of social life.

Talk of proxy wars and the spectre of Iranian-Saudi regional rivalry has
been ramped up on all sides of the war, serving primarily political
rather than analytical purposes.

[Nonetheless, without reducing the complexities of the war, it is
important to recognise that as [principal arms]{.mark} [suppliers to the
Saudi-led coalition, **the USA and the UK**, have been]{.mark} centrally
[**involved in the conflict**,]{.mark} [providing diplomatic cover for
the coalition's abuses as well **as the weapons with which to commit
them.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The immediate counter-argument is that the Houthis are also committing
violations of international law and doing so with Iranian support. But
Iranian support for the Houthis has become a self-fulfilling prophecy as
the war has continued, and the Houthis' likely war crimes are no reason
for the Saudi-led coalition not to be held accountable for its own
violations.

No concluded assessment

As a long-standing observer of UK arms export policy, one particular
element of the Court of Appeal's decision interests me. Not only did the
government make "no concluded assessments" of whether the coalition had
violated international humanitarian law (IHL), it "made no attempt to do
so."

[There seems to have been an undocumented decision in the early months
of 2016 that there would no attempt to answer this question about
whether Saudi Arabia had breached IHL.]{.underline} The MoD's database
of allegations of breaches of IHL originally included a column headed
"IHL Breach" that was removed without note or written justification.

[Thus, not only was the government not assessing whether the Saudi-led
coalition was breaching IHL, it was also quietly removing the means to
do so, and not creating a paper trail by which this change could be
documented or followed.]{.underline}

Key strategies

[Whether by design or incompetence, this undocumented change illustrates
one of the key strategies used by the UK government to try to manage
controversy over its arms export policy and to appear to respect
international law whilst continuing to supply weapons to the Saudi-led
coalition.]{.underline}

This strategy has centred on active attempts not to know, and not to be
seen to know, about likely or possible violations of IHL in the war in
Yemen.

The government's immediate response was to downplay the significance of
the judgment

[The government's tactics have included the mobilisation of doubt and
ambiguity about specific incidents, often through reference to secret,
ostensibly superior information; an emphasis on the friendly
relationship with Saudi Arabia that is mobilised to suggest that any
possible violations were accidental and that the Saudis are serious
about improving their targeting practices; and corrections to the
parliamentary record and attempts at the suppression of
information.]{.underline}

The goal of this strategy is to be able to continue to supply weapons to
Saudi Arabia despite a clear commitment not to transfer weapons where
there is a clear risk they might be used in serious violations of IHL,
and to claim the mantle of law-abiding respectability while doing so.

Downplaying the ruling

The Court of Appeal's decision should put paid to this effort. Yet the
government's immediate response was to downplay the significance of the
judgment, try to present it as a technicality, and assuage criticism by
promising that no new licences will be granted to members of the
Saudi-led coalition and a review will be conducted.

The Union Flag flies alongside the BAE flag (AFP)

[But open licences granted in 2013 and 2014 that allow the unlimited
transfer of bombs and missiles are still in operation and deliveries
under existing licences are not suspended]{.underline}. Trade Secretary
Liam Fox has indicated that new decisions would not necessarily be any
different to old ones.

[So now [the hard work]{.mark} beg[i]{.mark}n[s]{.mark} of [trying to
get the government to respect the decision and change its
practice]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[There are three core elements]{.mark} to a response [that would
respect]{.mark} the [legal decision. First, a transparent review of the
process by which decisions are made]{.mark}, including an explanation of
how the government assesses the link between past violations and future
risk.]{.underline}

[[Second, an inquiry into how unlawful decisions came to be
made]{.mark}, including the publication of legal advice and ministerial
direction. [Third, a commitment to suspend deliveries under existing
licences as well as a refusal of new licences.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Given that the UK's likely next prime minister, Boris Johnson, has
already been revealed to have given approval when he was foreign
secretary for export licences to Saudi Arabia in the midst of ongoing
attacks on civilian entities, and his opponent Jeremy Hunt, the current
foreign secretary, has claimed it would be "morally bankrupt" not to
sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, the task will be a tough one.

**[Nonetheless, [the legal decision opens the door for accountability
for the government's reckless policy, in which it has been unwilling to
pay attention to unlawful civilian harm and indifferent to the
consequences of its actions.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### AT: Human Security

#### The Alt fails and the plan is a prerequisite \-\-- International institutions ignore human security because they see it as a challenge, and academia sees it as "false priorities and hope"

Gerd **Oberleitner 2005**, lecturer at the Institute of International
Law and International Relations at the University of Graz, April-June
2005, "Human Security: A Challenge to International Law?", Brill,
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/27800564>

[[Human Security has become a catchphrase in the global debate on the
changing meaning of security]{.underline}]{.mark}. Over a period of ten
years, [[the concept of **human security has begun visibly to influence,
change, and challenge global politics**, institutions, and
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although the idea of human security was
preceded by similar concepts in reports of global commissions? the Palme
Commission,1 the Brandt Commission,2 the Brundtland Commission,3 and the
Commission on Global Governance4? human security as a distinctive new
concept was created and shaped by Mahbub ul-Haq in and around the 1994
UNDP Development Report.5 Soon afterwards, the Canadian government took
up the idea of human security and formulated it as a foreign policy
priority.6 On the initiative of Canada and other countries, the Human
Security Network was created as a coalition of the like-minded with the
aim of advancing human security globally.7 Japan has taken an interest
in human security and supports a variety of

initiatives.8 The Commission on Human Security,9 set up in 2001 and
co-chaired by Amartya Sen and Sadako Ogata, has concluded its work and
published its final report.10 The UN Trust Fund for Human Security was
established in 1999.11 In 2003, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan set up
the

Advisory Board on Human Security,12 and a Human Security Branch has been
established in the UN Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna.13

[[The concept has also attracted the interest of the academic
community]{.underline}]{.mark}. Institutes, centers, programs, and
certificates on human security have been established.14 An increasing
number of publications on human security now make their way into
libraries.15 A news bulletin on human security is being published
regularly.16 Conferences, seminars, and workshops produce an ever
greater number of academic papers on human security.17 An annual human
security report, edited by the Centre for Human Security at the
University of British Columbia, begins publication in 2005.18

Different from other academic disciplines[, [international law has been
**reluctant to respond** to the rise of human security, and the
potential of human security as a possible global normative framework has
attracted]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[less attention]{.underline}]{.mark}. In order to analyze the impact of
human security on the global agenda, [[the normative underpinnings of
the concept and the **consequences of its application in policymaking
for the international legal order deserve to be looked** at in more
detail]{.underline}]{.mark}. Are human security concerns already covered
by international law? Is it nothing new to international law at all, or
[is human security a challenge to international law]{.underline}? If
human security is nothing new to international law, where has it been
hiding? If it is a challenge, what areas of international law are
affected? Do we wish to accommodate the concept of human security in
international law and, if so, how? How would a human security approach
affect lawmaking, law enforcement, and international institutions? If we
wish to pursue a human security agenda on the global level, is
international law the appropriate tool for fostering human security, or
is it in its present state an obstacle?

In the following sections, I address some of these questions and
demonstrate that human security as a policy and normative ideal does
indeed pose a challenge to international law. My analysis focuses on
some key areas of international law that seem particularly prone to be
viewed through the lens of human security and on the UN as the core
institution of the international legal order. I argue that although many
of the under

lying concerns of the human security concept are by no means new to
international law, [[**a human security approach to international law
can reinforce and strengthen** attempts to bring international law
better into line with the requirements of today\'s
world]{.underline}.]{.mark} In order to do so, a brief analysis of what
we mean by human security is required.

What Is Human Security?

A decade after its emergence, human security remains a contested concept
in its definition, its scope, and its utility. Proponents see it as a
timely, necessary, and helpful expansion of traditional security
concerns and as

either a paradigm shift and dramatic departure from traditional security
concepts19 or a useful tool for shaping foreign policy.20 In this
respect, former Canadian minister of foreign affairs Lloyd Axworthy set
the stage when he outlined the Canadian answer to the question of the
changing meaning of security.21 Although some authors question the
usefulness of human security as a foreign policy tool, they acknowledge
the role of human security in conveniently grouping together and
collectively pushing a wide range of initiatives centered on people
rather than on the state. They see human security as a useful chapeau
that covers a new field of academic debate on security issues in the
light of various disciplines.22 At the same time, [[**the concept has
been rejected as far too universalistic**. Critics have pointed at
conceptual flaws and have argued that securitizing issues]{.mark} (and
the human being itself) [does not serve the victims of insecurity but
rather creates false priorities and hopes]{.mark}]{.underline}.23 Human
security has been regarded as a concept that cannot meaningfully be
reflected in practice, and it has been argued that none of the
initiatives on the human security agenda are new.24 [[**Human security
has been viewed as being contrary to the national interest of states and
as weakening foreign policy choices**, because it would seem to open the
way to justifying humanitarian intervention]{.underline}]{.mark} or to
forcing states into undertaking actions abroad that are against their
national interests.25 Some authors have also echoed the fear that human
security might become an

ideological instrument.26

Obviously, much depends on how human security is defined. Definitions
range from narrow concepts focusing on physical integrity to a broad
understanding that also encompasses psychological and emotional aspects
of security.27 The Commission on Human Security? arguably the most
wide-ranging and in-depth attempt to explore the concept? has defined
human security as \"protecting the vital core of all human lives in ways
that enhance human freedoms and human fulfilment.\"28 Sadako Ogata and
Johan Cels have elaborated on this definition: \"This means protecting
vital freedoms? fundamental to human existence and development. Human
security means protecting people from severe and pervasive threats, both
natural and societal, and

empowering individuals and communities to develop the capabilities for
making informed choices and acting on their own behalf. \'Vital
freedoms\' refer to the inalienable fundamental rights and freedoms that
are laid down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
human rights instruments.\"29

Although there is no commonly accepted definition of human security,
roughly three categories seem to emerge:30 a narrow approach that relies
on natural rights and the rule of law anchored in basic human rights; a
humanitarian approach that understands human security as a tool for
deepening and strengthening efforts to tackle issues such as war crimes
or genocide and finally preparing the ground for humanitarian
intervention; and a broad approach that links human security with the
state of the global economy, development, and globalization. In
addition, a \"regionalization\" of the discussion seems to have taken
place,

which includes sub-regional and intrastate security situations being
analyzed from a human security perspective.31 More importantly, [[human
security can be understood in very different ways]{.underline}:32 [as a
political agenda for governments]{.underline}]{.mark}; as a rallying cry
that unites ad hoc or sustained coalitions of states on single issues;
as a common concern that brings together single-issue civil society
groups under a uniting umbrella; as an academic problem; as a new
research category; [[or as an emerging normative framework in
international relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is the latter that is
of interest here.

As a political agenda, the concept of human security has been shaped and
applied on both the national and the intergovernmental level. [[The
great **strength of human security as a political agenda for global
governance seems to**]{.mark} [**lie in the fact that implementing it
\"requires overcoming the compartmentalization of security**,
humanitarian,]{.mark} [human rights, and development strategies by
focusing on the protection and empowerment of
people]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}\"33 In its rhetoric, its policies,
and its actions, [the UN seems increasingly to accept and to rely on
human security as part of its agenda]{.underline}. UN Secretary-General
Annan has frequently endorsed human security as a central issue for the
UN: \"Ensuring human security is, in the broadest sense, the United
Nations\' cardinal mission.\"34 On the national level, the Canadian
activities and leadership in human security as well as the position of
the Japanese government provide an experimental ground for human
security as a foreign policy tool.35 In this respect, Lloyd Axworthy has
defined human security as,

in essence, [[**an effort to construct a global society where the safety
of the individual is at the centre of the international priorities** and
a motivating force for international action]{.underline};]{.mark} where
[[international human rights]{.mark} [standards and the rule of law are
advanced and woven into a coherent web protecting the
individual]{.mark}]{.underline}; where those who violate these standards
are held fully accountable; and where our global, regional and bilateral
institutions? present and future? are built and equipped to enhance and
enforce these standards.36

As a rallying cry or catalyst that brings together like-minded
countries, the concept has led to the creation of the Human Security
Network, a cross-regional and loose matrix of thirteen countries with
the aim of fostering human security in international affairs.37 Human
security has also been taken up by civil society organizations and has
led to the creation of civil society networks, bringing together
otherwise unconnected nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The
Coalition for the International Criminal Court38 and the International
Campaign to Ban Land mines39 are but two examples. More recently, the
African Human Security Initiative has drawn together African NGOs with
the aim of assessing the human security performance of African
governments,40 [[Human security is also increasingly used by national
NGOs to bring together single-issue concerns and thereby create a
holistic framework for action]{.underline}]{.mark}.41

[[Viewed as an academic problem, the concept of human security has led
to a vivid discussion among scholars and has met with approval and
critique from various academic disciplines]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Academic articles, mostly

from the social sciences, from international relations theory, and from
defense, security, and peace studies, dwell on conceptual issues and
struggle with placing the concept in the framework of the respective
discipline.42 [[International law has been largely
silent]{.underline}]{.mark}, although the concept might well have
considerable impact on its future development in some of the following
key areas: the understanding of security in international law; the place
of human security in the UN Charter; the role of the Security Council,
state sovereignty, and humanitarian intervention; the creation of new
norms; and the place of nonstate actors in international law. Although
human security has left traces in these areas, [**[the challenge to
international law might well reach further and comprise both
international law as an operating system]{.mark}** (that is, its role as
a \"constitution\" for international society) [and the normative
system]{.mark}]{.underline} (that is, the values and goals international
law considers worth pursuing).4

[What has emerged from within these [critical]{.mark} [scholars]{.mark}
is that they [never outline an alternative]{.mark} set of principles and
ideals [for post-conflict peacebuilding and reconstruction]{.mark} and
therefore [they]{.mark} [do not advocate a strict non-involvement of
interveners]{.mark}.]{.underline} However the debate can be best
described as less about the validity of the liberal peace and more of
how to conceive of it and implement it. [The [critics]{.mark}
[argue]{.mark} that [Liberal Peacebuilding]{.mark} [is]{.mark} based on
the fact that [human]{.mark} [security]{.mark} guides the Liberal Peace
thesis in conceptualising a framework [for peacebuilding and maintenance
of the global order.]{.mark} The conceptualisation and [practice]{.mark}
of human security **[has been criticised as lacking in political
strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, 2007). This
means that while concepts such as Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and
the European Union doctrine for Human Security (2004) place ethical
responsibility on the international community to protect individuals
where states have failed or are unwilling to protect them, [[they ignore
the **importance of political deconstruction of the politics of
securitisation and militarised peacebuilding**]{.mark}. Thus,
[peacebuilders]{.mark} [are accused]{.mark} of embracing the hoary
"Liberal Peace approach" uncritically [and]{.mark} as a consequence they
[have]{.mark} often designed peacebuilding strategies that
[actually]{.mark} [destabilised]{.mark} fragile [transitional]{.mark}
[polities]{.mark} such as in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Bosnia, Burundi and
Iraq]{.underline} (Doyle and Sambanis, 1999; Newman et al., 2009; Paris,
1997). Sending (2011) acknowledges that [[these]{.mark} critical
[debates]{.mark} have [brought]{.mark} to the [fore]{.mark} the
importance of issues on context sensitivity, local ownership,
[bottomup]{.mark} and [hybrid]{.mark} [forms of peacebuilding]{.mark};
[however]{.mark}, there are limitations to these critiques as outlined
in the next section.]{.underline}

Mac Ginty (2010; 2008) explores an alternative conception of
peace-building through indigenous approaches to conflict resolution and
localised responses to conflict (2008; 2010). He proposes a hybrid
peacebuilding that acknowledges that the 'local' has agency and hence
"ability to hybridise the Liberal Peace by enforcing some change on it"
(Mac Ginty, 2011 p. 84). This hybrid approach has also been proposed by
other authors (Boege et al., 2009; Pugh et al., 2008; Richmond, 2010b).
Others such as, Boege et al (2009)propose "hybrid political orders" that
combine governance strategies of governments and of indigenous
communities (2009, p. 24). [Richmond has explored the more elusive
concept of 'an everyday "post-Liberal Peace" and critical policies for
peacebuilding' and, together with Franks, they propose an emancipatory
model that seeks local consent with full ownership of the peacebuilding
process, while critical of external international impositions,
conditionalities and dependencies expressed in the conservative and
orthodox models, however, this model takes a bottom up approach. [Even
then they fault this by highlighting that the underlying fact is that
**Liberal Peace is externally driven with the intention of 'stabilising'
states towards democracy and local participation**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Richmond and Franks, 2007 p. 30)

[Liberal peacebuilding's most trenchant [critics offer little in the way
of alternatives]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, some of them have begun
to discuss alternative approaches to liberal peacebuilding. Having been
one of the major critics of Liberal Peace building[, [Paris]{.mark}
[acknowledges]{.mark} that there is [no realistic alternative]{.mark} to
some form of Liberal Peace strategy, and that efforts should be geared
towards improving its applied approaches rather than dismissing it
entirely]{.underline} (Paris, 2012). This view is challenged by Cooper
et al (2011) who observe that such a view fails to take cognizance of
the common prescriptions of Liberal Peacebuilding, particularly in
political economy. [Instead they propose a welfare based approach,
arguing that this will incorporate the wellbeing of the individual and
community within the political economy of peacebuilding]{.underline} (p.
11).

## Sovereignty Good

#### Sovereignty is key to prevent war that lead to annihilation\-\-- having the ability to regulate war in conflict is a prerequisite to peace

**Odysseos** and **Petito** **07**, Professor of International Relations
(International Relations, International Development; Lecturer in
International Relations (International Relations, Sussex European
Institute, International Development, "The International Political
Thought of Carl Schmitt: Terror, Liberal War and the Crisis of Global
Order", 2007, https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203964149

The first achievement concerns the aforementioned ability of the
Westphalian order to bracket and regulate war: the lines or distinctions
(the so-called \'amity lines\') drawn between European soil and the
\'free space\' available for appropriation facilitated the bracketing of
war on European soil. [[The amity lines]{.mark} [set]{.mark} aside two
distinct areas considered \'open spaces\' (Schmitt 2003:94--95): on the
one hand, the [landmass of the New World, whose belonging to the native
populations was not recognised]{.mark}, and on the other, the newly
mapped and navigable seas.]{.underline} [[In]{.mark} both types of
[\'open space\', force could be used freely and ruthlessly]{.mark} as
these were areas \'designated for agonal tests of strength\' amongst
European powers]{.underline} (ibid.: 99). In other words, [Schmitt
argues that the sharp distinction drawn between Europe and the rest of
the world made it possible for states to find ways in which to gauge
their opponents\' strength,]{.underline} usually by striving for
appropriation of lands in the New World or by fighting limited wars on
European soil. Schmitt does not deny that this spatial distinction
\'presupposed the consignment of unrestrained violence to the rest of
the world\' (Rasch 2005:258), and, in part, this is why his
understanding of Westphalia is so much more interesting than the one
commonplace in International Relations, although it might appear
shocking to readers expecting the wholesale condemnation of violence and
war, while being, at the same time, cynical about the veracity of such
condemnations.

In this peculiar way, therefore, [[the]{.mark} interstate [order]{.mark}
which existed until 1914 had sought, through the spatiality [of]{.mark}
its [international law, \'to prevent wars of annihilation]{.mark}, i.e.
to the extent that war was inevitable, to bracket it\']{.underline}
(Schmitt 2003:246). It is important to distinguish such \'bracketing\'
from attempts to abolish or banish war, that is, to end war as such,
which are characteristic of both classical and contemporary liberalism
(Joas 2003). The jus publicum Europaeum recognised that [[\'any
abolition of war]{.mark} without true bracketing [resulted]{.mark} only
[in]{.mark} new, perhaps even [worse types of war]{.mark}, such as
reversions to civil war and other types of wars of
annihilation\']{.underline} (Schmitt 2003:246). [[It accepted war as an
inevitable]{.mark} [occurrence]{.mark} of international political order
[and in doing so laid a foundation for \'a bracketing of war\']{.mark}:
\'\[t\]he essence of such wars was a regulated contest of forces gauged
by witnesses in a bracketed space.]{.underline} Such wars are the
opposite of disorder\' (ibid.: 187).

[[The]{.mark} [acceptance]{.mark} of this type of regulated but limited
warfare also [enabled]{.mark} the [recognition]{.mark} of the opponent
as an enemy on equal grounds.]{.underline} This development of the
notion of justus hostis, associated with the denigration of justa causa
(just cause), in the commencement and waging of war, is the second
achievement of this order. [The concept [of]{.mark} an \'equal and just
[enemy\']{.mark} evolved alongside the emergence [and consolidation of
the modern state]{.mark} as the predominant political
entity]{.underline} (see Teschke 2003 for a contrary account), as well
as the weakening of the moral authority of the Church. [Under these
conditions, [warfare became divorced from substantive causes of
justice]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Since war was the means by which land
could change ownership status, \'war came to be judged in terms of its
outcome\' and, indeed, became a type of political relation amongst
states]{.underline} (Schmitt 2003:100). [[Any]{.mark} [enemy]{.mark}
which had the form of a state was a just enemy and war [could be waged
against it]{.mark}.]{.underline} This avoided wars of conviction, creed
and religion (that is, based on a justa causa) which had historically
taken war to an extreme, seeking the enemy\'s annihilation. [For
Schmitt, whose belief was that [war]{.mark} was an inevitable part of
political life, this regulation of war [without]{.mark} substantive
cause meant a [\'rationalization, humanization and
legalization\']{.mark} of war; regarding an enemy as both just and as an
equal partner meant that peace could be made with that
enemy.]{.underline} His ultimate destruction was not sought, but
conflict with him was possible and regulated by established norms and
rules. The development of the notion of justus hostis and the
elimination of just cause, moreover, also indicated an order of
relations and a system of war which recognised the enemy\'s \'right\' to
resistance and self-defence.

#### A multipolar world will open up avenues to manage conflicts\-\-- a unified global order is not safe from pseudouniversalism

**Odysseos** and **Petito** **07**, Professor of International Relations
(International Relations, International Development; Lecturer in
International Relations (International Relations, Sussex European
Institute, International Development, "The International Political
Thought of Carl Schmitt: Terror, Liberal War and the Crisis of Global
Order", 2007, <https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203964149>

How could one envisage an alternative to such a dangerous situation?
What kind of order could replace the jus publicum Europaeum? Those
questions were at the centre of Schmitt\'s preoccupations in several
writings of the 1950s and early 1960s, in which he discussed the
possibility of a new \'nomos of the earth\'. In an article of 1952 [he
examined how the [dualism created by the]{.mark} [Cold War]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the [polarization between capitalism and communism could
evolve]{.mark}, and he imagined [several possible
scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline} (Schmitt 1952). [[He rejected]{.mark} the
idea that such a dualism was only the prelude to [a final unification of
the world]{.mark}, resulting from the final victory of one of the
antagonists which had managed to impose its system and its ideology
worldwide.]{.underline} The end of bipolarity was likely to lead to a
new equilibrium guaranteed by US hegemony. However, [Schmitt also
envisaged the possibility of another form of evolution consisting in the
[opening of a dynamics of pluralization whose outcome]{.mark} could be
the establishment of [a new global order]{.mark} based [**on the
existence of several autonomous regional blocs**. This would
provide]{.mark} the conditions for [an equilibrium of forces among
various large spaces, instituting]{.mark} among them [a new system of
international law]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such an equilibrium would
present similarities with the old jus publicum Europaeum except that in
this case it would be truly global and not only Eurocentric. This was
clearly the kind of evolution that he favoured. [Schmitt did not believe
that the existing dualism could last and he was acutely aware of the
possible consequences of the establishment of a unipolar world order. He
was convinced that, by establishing a \'true pluralism\', [a multipolar
world order]{.mark} alone [could]{.mark} provide the institutions
necessary to [**manage conflicts and avoid the negative** consequences
resulting from the pseudouniversalism produced by the **generalization
of one single system**]{.mark}. He was, however, too aware that such a
pseudo-universalism was a much more likely outcome than the pluralism he
advocated. And unfortunately his fears have been confirmed since the
collapse of communism.]{.underline}
